{"text":"A very interesting little diner. Not much to see from outside, but a very nice busy atmosphere. The service was very good (no complaints) and the food was simple but tasty. Their \"homemade\" chilli sauce wasa particularly nice (comes with the omelettes)."}
{"text":"Why do I have a soft spot for you?  My father came to Toronto in the mid fifties and you folks extended a hand to him and he got his employment start with ya...he is know gone but I feel him in your place because I can only imagine it was very similar interior. I love it!

The food is super! My regular order is a pint and the club sandwich. Primo. Basic and yet soo fulfilling! Depending on the abdominal threshold I will endeavor to squeeze in an outstanding slice of carrots cake - best I've  EVER had. 

I will continue to join you as its a great spot for a casual business meeting and your staff are great.

BRAVO! (I'M bowing with utmost respect)"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant from the past century! Totally worthy the salmon omelette delicious"}
{"text":"Place is overrated, yes decor is cute and location is great, but food could be a little better, we had omlets and it was nothing special at all"}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes. But, they charged me 3.5$ when I asked a bit more yogurt with my granola. (I really got little yogurt was not enough to touch all my granola when I mixed it)"}
{"text":"When I was told The Senator is the oldest restaurant in Toronto I wasn't surprised. 
IN A GOOD WAY. I have been going there for years and it is constantly delicious, no wonder they have been going for so long.

I usually go for breakfast and get the house cured lox and bagel platter and COFFEE!! They switched over to Dark City Roast about a year ago and I can't think of getting my cup of Joe anywhere else. I was recently told they added a cocktail program and new dinner menu. I was a bit skeptical about going for dinner as I usually think of the place as an all-day breakfast diner. Being in my late 20's I usually head to the west end for drinks. I was pleasantly surprised with how amazing the cocktails and food were and dinner. Nothing you would expect from a diner - fresh farm-to-table food and unique cocktails! Really great. It's really beautiful to see an unpretentious restaurant doing it right and not so in your face about it (found out they always have served local, seasonal, fresh food). They know whats up and I seriously suggest this spot to dine at! Where else can you go for great breakfast - lunch - dinner?"}
{"text":"Awesome little gem! Use wholesome ingredients, home cooked appeal. Definitely something you can't find these days!! Had the Huevos rancheros. Delicious! You get more than what you pay for in terms of quality for sure."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for some time. Finally got out there for Sunday brunch with girlfriends. The ambience and decor were noteworthy. I order the eggs/peameal bacon combo. As a whole, it was fairly standard fare. The challah bread, however, was amazing. The portions were massive and I was quite stuffed at the end. Definitely would come here again for the bread!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today.  The Senator is a nice cozy diner to escape from the hustle and bustle of the Eaton Centre outside.  I ordered the Cubano, which was a pleasantly flavourful slow-roasted pork loin sandwich.  Good value for flavour.  Be warned that some of the two-seater booths are a little tight if you plan on ordering a lot of food."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Senator.  This is the kind of place that could become my local if I lived anywhere near it.  It just has good old fashioned, no nonsense solid food.

I also really like the aeshetic - its nothing fancy by any means, but is somewhat comforting.  I came here the other night with a friend before we went to the Royal Alex to see Private Lives (great show if you have a chance to see it).  She had the clubhouse sandwich which had a real, thick piece of chicken on it.  She said it was great.  I had the cumbrae burger as I was feeling in the mood for one.   Excellent!  It came with sauteed onions and the fries were great.  I also had the strawberry milkshake and it was one of the old-fashioned kinds that they serve in the steel cup - fantastic!

We were both too full for dessert, but the pies looked pretty good from what I saw on my way out."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch place. Space is small and there's a short wait - but well worth it. Had the eggs Benedict - done properly. 

Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago for the first time with a friend that kept raving about it.  I - being a brunch addict - was quite exciting but my mood diminished when I saw the long line up.  After waiting for about 30 mins and mentally hating my friend for making me wait in line, we finally got seated.

I was recommended to have one of the omelettes.  I ordered the smoke salmon omelette and while I enjoyed it, I would have much rather had my salmon mixed into the omelette instead of sitting on top of my omelette (or what I secretly thought was unscrambled egg).  Also, loved the potatoes and bread that came with my omelettes.

Overall, the food was great - but let's be honest, food is only 83% (Barney Stinson's favourite percentage!) of importance when dining.  

I was impress with the quick service we received once we got in.  We had a really friendly and awesome waiter who was probably juggling one too many tables but had an awesome smile on his face.

The seating arrangement was meh.  Just meh.  It was a bit squishy.  I enjoyed the company of my friend that I went with but probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I wasn't shrinking my legs so much to avoid footsy.  

Overall recommendation?  Thumbs up for people who like brunch, thumbs down for people over 5'8\" squishing themselves in a small booth."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Senator. There are several reasons that I love this place: 

 - The History
 - It is downtown
 - Has tons of great comfort food
 - A clean bathroom
 - a free piece of liquorice on your way out
 - friendly service

**if you are in the Eaton Centre area and don't want to eat at a touristy spot, this is the place for you!**"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Huevos Rancheros was so fresh. They make a perfect cortado too. Love the ambiance. Busy but we were seated quickly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"great atmosphere, good service, yummy french toast and eggs."}
{"text":"Best diner experience ever! Went there for their brunch and had the salmon eggs benedicts which was absolutely delicious. The eggs looked different and tasted very fresh, which made the whole dish exceptionally tasty. Also ordered a flat white with soy which paired well with the eggs benedicts. Service was quick and efficient. Be sure to arrive early to skip the queue. Head to the senator if you're craving for a fuss free brunch!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast - extremely overpriced.  $60 for 3 people. Mediocre food at the best. Customer service was good though."}
{"text":"We decided to try their breakfast because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed.  We had the Senator Breakfast and homemade croissant with a side of a buttermilk pancake. The pancake was cooked perfectly and a little crunchy. We should have ordered more but was full. I only have one minor negative comment, they don't have high chairs for small kids and our two kids had to sit on our laps, the aisles are narrow so we understand why."}
{"text":"D ordered the Senator Breakfast that consisted of bacon, eggs, toast, and home fries - a classic breakfast choice. They had homemade jam at the table for the toast, but it looked like it had been played with so we didn't bother touching that lol.

I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It comes with 2 poached eggs and smoked salmon with hollandaise on a homemade biscuit. It was also served with a salad or home fries. I decided to go with the salad, since I already knew I'd need something 'light' to balance out my hearty meal.

Overall, breakfast was great. The service was alright - they weren't too attentive but I've experienced much worse. We weren't rushed to leave although there was quite a line when we left. Food was great though, and we both devoured our meals. I would definitely recommend visiting Senator for brunch if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsa and cool old school decor. It feels like you're stepping into the 60s. All that's missing is the waitresses on roller skates."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about the Senator. 

The breakfast is good on all levels - the eggs are fresh and dark yolked (tons of flavour), beans are a fantastic addition while the portion sizes are perfect. Most places give you mega servings of bad hash browns. 

The Senator is quality and well priced. 

Great spot."}
{"text":"I think the chef needs to google \"Huevos Rancheros\" because what they served me has nothing to do with it. They just serve 2 eggs and a side of chorizo, and something they promised to be \"salsa\". Apparently their salsa was a \"pico de gallo\" except pico de gallo is more than chopped tomato and onion put together. Absolutely uninspired, tasteless, misrepresented food."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, and you have to try the Gallette (warmed up and a scoop of ice cream) it's to die for!!! Tess was an awesome waitress!!!"}
{"text":"This place is most definitely overrated. The service is whatever, and the food didn't taste very good. We had the senators burger and the Huevos Rancheros. However, the corn bread was good, and i usually don't like corn bread. I must also add the presentation of the food was not very appetizing."}
{"text":"I wanted to visit this place for breakfast but unfortunately their breakfast ends at 11:30 am on weekdays and they have limited all day breakfast dishes. I had the chorizo and eggs which was a pretty good meal. You can't really go wrong with it. The chorizo was delicious. I would definitely visit again for brunch or breakfast so I can try their pancakes and French toast. There might be a bit of a wait but it is worth it if you're in the area. The ambience and service is good too"}
{"text":"Exactly as Yelp describes a two star rating... Meh. I've experienced better. As far as ambiance, it's quite cool and the servers are really nice. However, in terms of food, the pancakes and senator bfast were alright but nothing special. Also the server, though very nice, almost overcharged us by $10."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. It's our weekend brunch spot. Please go check it out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The punchline of this review is that management at The Senator cannot simply rely on the longstanding history of this restaurant to survive. The servers need to undergo serious customer service training. The way and manner in which we were treated today as customers by our server will not be tolerated in a competitive restaurant environment in downtown Toronto long term. 

On Sunday December 3, 2017 we arrived at 11:45am to put our names on the list. Customers can't wait inside, they can only wait outside and it was chilly. During that wait, my friend and I went to get Starbucks coffee to warm up because all potential customers have to wait outside. My friend got a coffee to warm her hands.  At around 12:20pm, we were seated at a table near the middle of the restaurant. A dark haired young Caucasian man was our server. We didn't get his name. Without even a hello or greeting his first comment was that we cannot allow outside drinks in here; he said it wasn't his fault, it was his boss. Then he walked away. My friend poured it into a glass and started chugging it so that it would be finished. He came back again and said he had to take it away from her. So she just drank it in front of him so that we could move on with our lives. We ordered our meals. 

Partway through I ordered a root beer and when he came back with it he slammed it down on the table so hard, the table shook with a loud bang. He asked if I wanted a glass with it and I said sure. He brought back a glass for it and slammed down it down so hard it startled me and the table shook again. It was not a flimsy table. He never came back again to our table and other servers had to clear our table and give us the bill. 

I appreciated that he may have been in a bad mood and thus assigned someone else to our table to assist us as a result (and if so, I appreciate the gesture), but if he simply given my friend an empty mug and given her more more than 30 seconds to finish her coffee, we both would have ordered multiple drinks. Or, if he had not chosen to be rude slam down drinks violently on our table to make a passive aggressive point, I would not have written this review."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday around 10 AM in the morning. This is my second visit here, so I knew I had to come here earlier or else it gets packed, but friends were late. The wait was about 20 minutes to be seated. I ordered eggs benedict while my friends ordered two Real Good Plates. My plate was good, although my biscuit was a little soggy and there weren't enough home fries. The last time I went I ordered the Real Good Plate and it definitely came with a lot more home fries. My friends had no complaints about their food. Food 4.5/5

The only reason I took off a star was because of the servers working that day. I don't know who he is exactly, but he was an older and bigger man in his 40-50s who was gay and he kept touching the other servers. The first time I noticed his behaviour, he put his hands around one of the female servers to adjust her shirt at the top of her shoulders, which was really bizarre. I've never seen that at any restaurants I've ever been to. The second time he put his arm around the waist of another younger gay male server. I have no problem with gay people and only wanted to point it out since that may or may not explain his behaviour...

Either way, he filled up our coffees whenever it was empty and cleared our plates promptly. The younger server got us our bills and I'd like to say he looks sort of like Rami Malek from Mr. Robot. This is totally a compliment, they're both wickedly handsome. Service 4/5 - would be 5/5 if not for the creepy behaviour."}
{"text":"Food is ok. I was appalled to hear the chef refused to cook me up one of their 3 egg omelettes using only 1 egg yolk.  The server came back and advised me the chef said it was a hassle.  How hard can it be to separate egg yolks...even my kid can do that for me."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast. Fresh, delicious food and amazing service. Great diner and so convenient. Doesn't feel like a tourist trap in the middle of downtown. Would go here every morning!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. It's refreshing to have a brunch that actually has taste. The decor is also very quaint, which adds to the restaurant's charm. While the food is very good, I deducted two stars for the poor service. Our server (I believe her name was \"Shakiah\") seemed totally uninterested in our table. We had to constantly flag her down to get such basic things as coffee or water refills."}
{"text":"Great location. Small diner. We had a group of 8 and had to sit in 2 different booths near each other. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the challah French toast which was great. Food came out fast. Bathroom downstairs was clean."}
{"text":"Beans for breakfast? At any rate, color this uncultured American impressed.  Fast, inexpensive, tasty."}
{"text":"Oh Senator how I love thee.  I love it for what is is,an unpretentious good food diner.  Upon arrival we were seated quickly and the menus were already on the table.  we ordered two orders of french toast and omelette's.   We also had coffees and fresh oj.  The oj had pulp in it and it was delicious. The french toast came with a fruit marmalade which was very good.  the omelette's were also very good and came with a side of bread.  The strawberry jam that they give you is yummy.   The waitress was also nice. My in-laws could not stop talking about how good the coffee was, trust me  that is very rare for a diner to have good coffee.  we tried to go a second day in a row but they were closed for the Monday after Canada Day."}
{"text":"Found this gem by chance this summer and have never turned back. I've had the blueberry pancakes about 10 times and even had the pleasure of the peach which were delicious. I even decided to give this place a whirl for dinner and was amazed by the pot roast which just melted in my mouth. Loved the side of root veggies. Just like a nice Sunday lunch at home. There's usually a line-up for brunch so go early!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great breakfast spot in Toronto? Don't look any further. Senator is a warm welcoming dive bar environment great for small groups. My wife and I were looking for a breakfast spot and the barista at Starbucks told us to try this place out.

I order the triple stack buttermilk pancakes with a side of home fries. My wife order the Real Good Plate (pancake, couple strips of bacon, home fries, toast and baked beans). Both dishes were delicious and came out in less than 15 minutes after we ordered. We hear the spot gets really busy but we walked in, waited in line for 2 minutes and go seated. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Easily lived up to my expectation - contrary to one other review the place was spotless and dust/dirt free, good wait staff and uber fresh ingredients.  Only thing that detracts is noise level but you can't do much about it.

We\"ll be back"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch experience here. Had to wait in a short line, probably not a good idea for large groups, but with two of us it was only 10ish minutes. The staff was very upbeat and friendly. The chai latte and hot chocolate were delicious and in a generous serving size. The huevos rancheros were fresh and filling. There was also a great music playlist going - always a perk!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while on a vacation in Toronto. Staff was friendly and relaxed, and the place had this retro thing going on...not in a kitchy sort of way, but in a \"half-assed-but-still-pulling-it-off\" sort-of way.

The Senator was fairly busy when we stopped in, but there was plenty of room at the counter for the bf and I to sit. The food is good enough to satisfy, but not so good that my inner-foodie celebration-alarm goes off. I had the french toast (decently yummy), and the bf had one of their basic eggs/toast/home fries plates. He liked it enough to consider going back there another morning.

The free WiFi is nice if you need it.

Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for a dependable-y good breakfast."}
{"text":"A very average diner, nothing special about the food. Expensive also. I get that it's old and has history but any diner in the area we live in the US would serve the same food and at half the price. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, excellent wait staff and one of the best Cobb Salads I've eaten. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A really nice place with perfect homestyle cooking (and baking) and friendly service in a beautifully authentic old restaurant that puts the many chains cashing in on the retro trend in their place. The  As for the price - I don't feel it's overpriced; freshly cooked food can simply not be had at the price of a McGenericChemistry meal!

We chanced upon The Senator on a quiet Sunday evening and decided to stay. I'm so glad we did, I couldn't think of a better place in the area to have Sunday dinner. I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes (which was a great homestyle classic, very well done) and my partner had the roast chicken, which was phenomenal. A wonderfully moist chicken breast roasted to order with lovely crunchy vegetables and a sauce made from the roasting juices. We finished the meal with a perfectly sweet pecan pie with ice cream. Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"4/5! One of Toronto's oldest diners! The salmon Brie omelette is great! Also recommend the pancakes! Only downside is there can be a wait so go early. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is cute and classic"}
{"text":"This place OWNS in terms of decor and that oldie diner feel (booths are awesome). 

On the other hand, the food is just meh at best. Granted, I've only had breakfast here a few times, so perhaps my review is limited to those options. They bring you decent portions of beans, toast, bacon, tatos, and 2 eggs for $8, but the quality is mediocre, and the dish just looks messy. Coffee is drinkable. For the price, and in downtown Toronto, it's actually a great value, but it really could be just a taaad better. 

If I want to get an inexpensive, quality American diner breakfast, I'd rather go to High Park's Grenadier Cafe, where there's a similar meal for $4-6, and a huge patio where you can enjoy views of the park. Glad I tried out The Senator though!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and really friendly service. Definitely recommend this for breakfast when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"A Gem in Core downtown Yonge/Dundas area for diner-style restaurant.
Coffee is good, the peameal BLT is excellent and the chocolate cake is very moist ( with an ice-cream on side)!
It is the diner I am looking for in downtown. Good price and good food! 
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, friendly service, and reasonable prices.  It's an old, downtown diner. Coat racks attached to every booth.  I'll bet that's handy in the winter. Looks like they have lots of regulars.  The banana bread at the register looked delicious but I was too full to buy a slice.  Maybe next time.

Hope to eat there again."}
{"text":"got the senator breakfast special with chorizo... everything on that plate was fresh and Delicious. came with 4 slices of bread and baked beans with parmentier potatoes. will defiantly come back . coffees not to shabby too"}
{"text":"I really love this place, the decor is very San Francisco-like and the staff is nice.

Love the food and freshly squeezed orange juices, they don't have brown sugar for coffee but let's not be so picky!

I always liked our visit at this place and can't wait to go back on a Sunday morning brunch mmm gram gnam!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Small place but okay food good prices right downtown. Tuna special was pretty good. This is canned tuna and mayo with a salad and soup. Don't look for anything fancy. But if you want a quick diner lunch-- this is the place."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, challah toast and REAL orange juice. The ambience was nice, as were the waiters. A little pricey, but a good breakfast here."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here around twice a week, and it is always consistently good. The service is great, everyone says hello to you and is cheery even in the early hours. Alicia the bartender is a star."}
{"text":"We drive from Oakville just to eat here, that's how good this place is.
Their eggs Benny are without equal in TO. Haven't had Hollandaise this tasty since San Francisco twelve years ago, and their eggs and bacon (all organic, naturally raised) are awesome. The home fries are tasty, crispy and fresh!

The lunch sandwiches are great - the club was so big my ten year old took half home, the cheese and bacon was lovely and I was surprised to discover that even the side dishes (cinnamon apples and coleslaw, which is rarely more than a soggy mess in restaurants) were outstanding. Great fries too and all the portions are generous for a hungry adult.
Please open a location in the west end guys, we sorely need you!"}
{"text":"A definite win! One of my all time best low key diner experiences. If I'm in town, I'm making a point to stop in for bfast. Keep in mind being in the middle of downtown core and the plethora of ethnic cuisine options, a diner was not my first option but I was craving bfast and the reviews compelled me to check it out. 
Waking in, the entrance is understated and opens up to a beautiful 1900s traditional and well preserved casual yet classy diner with brilliant decor details throughout (clock in the rear, the pendant lights, coffee bar and wooden booth style seating) not to mention the aroma of fresh ground coffee. 
You are immediately greeted with friendly, cute  and attentive staff, which frankly had me at hello. 
The coffee is indeed fresh roasted and the organic milk fresh and local, overall making a very rich, well brewed and bold coffee that hit the spot. 
While the servers are friendly and attentive the food service does take a while. 
On Monday I decided to try the senator breakfast that had a pancake (fresh, light, buttery, thin) 2eggs (fresh scrambled and cooked perfectly), baked beans (yum), home fries with onions (fresh, not too greasy and seasoned perfectly), Canadian maple syrup, grilled buttered challah bread with a raspberry homemade jam (fresh, perfect sweetness and delicious) on a large platter. It was perfect. 
On Tuesday (yup I came back) I had the recommended heuvos rancheros with my coffee and I opted for a side of challah bread and jam again. The coffee, organic milk, challah bread and jam didn't disappoint again. The heuvos rancheros from an appearance and flavor missed the mark on what a traditional recipe needs but it had all the elements and each ingredient was cooked well. The chorizo was good and grilled well, the eggs great, the salsa a basic blend, the sliced avocado fresh, the black beans standard and the homemade cornbread was ok to good (had a good kick but a little too greasy) 
Overall still love this place, but keep in mind after 11:30am they stop serving the Ps (pancakes and poached eggs) :("}
{"text":"DO NOT go here for dinner. Prices + so-so food quality + stingy portioning = rip-off. I will not be back.

We assumed that paying $18 for fish and chips would result in, well, delicious fish and chips. We were very wrong. We got two skimpy pieces of deep fried frozen fish in mushy bland batter. The battering seemed old, or like it had been done off-site en masse...fish sticks anyone? We had a side of mashed potatoes instead of fries, and they were very good: nice red potatoes with the skin left on...but again, skimpy on the portion. Half the price and this dish would be decent value.

In my experience you can often judge a restaurant by its Caesar salad. The Senator's was $9 for a boring plate of lettuce and croutons. The sourdough croutons were nice and tangy; too bad there were only 4 of them. 

Usually Caesar mistakes are due to over-dressing. Until I ate at the Senator I didn't think it was possible to err in the other direction, but they managed it. I had to send a search party out to find the dressing on my palate with no success, so I used the lemon wedges to give the salad some kind of sauciness. What dressing I could taste was ok, but there was no anchovy to report, or shredded parmesan, all those things that make a Caesar a joy to eat. Parmesan is mentioned in the menu description but I can't describe it from my Senator experience. Perhaps it was applied with the same microscopic zeal that dressing was doled out with. Near the end I found a large hunk of bitter Romaine heart/base that had missed shredding (yuck), as well as a few pieces of lettuce with (gasp) visible salad dressing that had not been mixed in. I savoured those last to enjoy the illusion of having eaten a real Caesar salad. 

I also had the \"Senator Famous House Smoked Salmon, Cucumber Salad, Pickled Red Onion\" for $12. This was good: price normal, portion normal, homemade pickled cucumber and onion were a very nice compliment to the (mild) smoked salmon. Call me a traditionalist, but the lack of capers made me a little sad. The salmon had a lovely plump texture. It came with some store-bought pumpernickel bread and a forlorn schmear of cream cheese. Forlorn because it was underdeveloped, unloved, puny. Looking at it and trying to figure out how to stretch it over 2 slices of pumpernickel made my brain hurt, so I instead let myself imagine back to the Camelot of portions at the Senator, a time when the kitchen bestowed food generously and appropriately, until perhaps a succession of diners ruined it for the rest of us, sending the chef into bouts of rage over mountains of unused cream cheese sympathetic dishpigs tried valiantly to hide from view. To keep the chef's blood pressure down, those days are gone and now the kitchen primly doles out stinge revenge on a new generation of hungry big-walleted prey...

If a restaurant is going to charge these prices for upscale diner cuisine, it better be delicious. You can even get away with skimpy if it's delicious. But if it ain't delicious, and it's skimpy and expensive to boot, scr*w you and the price you rode in on. 

Service was ok, fast and friendly. It was the pre-theatre rush, and they were able to accommodate our request to get fed and out within 45 min. Only real objection would be that our server seemed to be on auto-pilot -- when he asked us any questions (e.g. how was the food) , he obviously ignored the answer, looking all over the place and giving no sign that he registered our actual response, only that we had replied in some fashion. But then we went there for dinner, not therapy :P

It must be pointed out that it is ridiculous to call this place \"wheelchair-accessible\". The bathroom is down a steep flight of stairs, and the room is long and narrow with small booths. I suppose diners in wheelchairs could sit by themselves at the door to eat, as long as they don't mind people clambering over them to get into the rest of the place, and don't have to go to the bathroom...how memorable for them.

And yes, the decor is gorgeous and fun, high ceilings, wood booths, cozy. Even the tiny table in the back affords a fun view of other eaters and their talking heads. However, it will probably be difficult to get over my poor first experience here to try their brunch menu. Especially since the coffee isn't even good. Sigh."}
{"text":"When you walk into The Senator you feel like you travelled back in time a bit.  The atmosphere is quaint and reminds you of early diners -  which is very cool but not surprising since the restaurant has been around since 1929!  The staff were very friendly, the service prompt and the food delicious.  If you're in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"The senator has all the trimmings for a great breakfast spot; fresh squeezed oj, cute setting, great espresso service and unique and distinctive food items and sides that make a compelling experience.

Where they fell short, they really missed the mark; not friendly to the stroller crowd, no refills on coffee, and a general sense that they were not happy people working the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really nice breakfast - excellent Chai tea (premium stuff) - this is our second trip to Toronto and last year we found the Coach House (?) on Yonge St, which was great - this place has a little more character and is a little nearer to our hotel (this time)."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go for a while; pleasantly surprised.
Beef and barley soup ad blt is A OK with me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to be in the area for breakfast/an early lunch today so I checked out Yelp and found The Senator and decided to give it a try.  We showed up at about 11:10am and we waited about 10-15 minutes for a table, luckily we got there right before a rush of people.  The restaurant claims to not take reservations however while we were waiting a group of 7 came in and had a table waiting for them. It appeared as though they were able to get a reservation because the size of the group and they were from out of town (there was only 1 table at the very back that seemed to be able to accommodate a group of that size). 

On to the actual review.  The decor and vibe is of an old school diner.  It is mostly booths which is great since the seating tends to be more comfortable.  Moving on to the food.  The coffee was really good and there are free refills, also we were offered milk and/or cream.  I got one of the specials; eggs benedict with peameal bacon on a garlic biscuit.  It came with beans and homefries. Overall the eggs were cooked perfectly and the garlic biscuit was amazing.  I didn't love the hollandaise, it was better than not having hollandaise but definitely not the best I've had.  The beans I could've done without and next time I may ask for them on the side but the homefries were amazing.  When I first saw the plate I was a little concerned about the portion size but I can say that I had difficulty finishing my plate, and I can eat.  My husband got the chili beef omelette with aged cheddar.  I think it was overcooked a little, I prefer mine to be a little undercooked and yellow, no brown bits but this one has quite a bit of brown bits to it.  Also it was quite large in the shape of a circle, I have a feeling it was made on some type of omelette press thingy.  Despite being quite busy our server was friendly, quick and efficient. 

Our bill came to $38 with 2 meals, 2 cups of coffee, tax and tip.  Overall a great dining experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I didn't have yelp, I would never have found this place. Nestled close to Yonge and Dundas Square, on Victoria Street. With a big sign painted on the side of the building this place is hard to miss and once you enter you know it will never be forgotten. 
 Fashioned after an old school diner (or perhaps since this place has been here for quite some time, there have only been a few updates to keep it looking in tip top condition, while maintaining the old school look), this restaurant was packed for their all day breakfast service. 
 The staff was friendly and kept the line of people engaged while they waited to be seated at a booth. Their menu has all the diner staples, from a club sandwich to pancakes for great prices and large portions. My boyfriend and I make the effort to go here at least once a month for breakfast or lunch, and I strongly recommend it for those who are in the city looking for great food."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast - and very convenient if you are going to see a show a the Canon Theatre.

The atmosphere is fun - this place has been around for ages and it looks appropriately retro which just makes brunch all the more fun :)

On the note of brunch...Brunch at the Senator doesn't start until 11:30, before that you are restricted to the breakfast menu so beware. Also - the price of the \"Senator breakfast\" goes up by two dollars at 11:30. However, our great waiter made light of this and was willing to let us wait 15 minutes to order just on the border of 11:30 in case people at the table wanted both cheap breakfast and yummy brunch.

Side note for coffee drinkers - the waiter was happy to tell us that they make their own blend on site...but beware that if you order decaf it will be instant!! This isn't a big deal for me...but I know a lot of people who would be really disappointed with instant!

Overall - fun place with yummy food (true greasy spoon) so have fun - and be aware that you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great brunch/breakfast place hidden just near Dundas Square. This place doesnt need reviews because they been around for centuries serving up quality breakfast and brunch menus. My fav the canadian breaskfast w their hashbrowns and sweet beans. Their egg bennies are also very legit. You can expect a line up during weekends durin peak brunch hours."}
{"text":"Cute little diner. Has a variety of diner food. Good for brunch but go early as it fills up and there is no room to wait indoors. There is not a lot of space in the restaurant and most tables are booths so there is a limit to the size of party that can be accommodate.

Service is attentive when its not busy. 

Over the last couple of years we've had:

sticky toffee pudding (somewhat hit or miss)
eggs Benedict (4/5)
cakes (4/5)
coffee(3/5)"}
{"text":"When you're trapped at Yonge/Dundas and want breakfast food that is a little more authentic than say, Fran's or Eggspectations, tuck into this hidden little joint just east of YD-Square and you'll find Toronto's oldest restaurant. 

Yes, that's right, Toronto's Oldest Restaurant, circa 1860. The space looks like it has barely changed since then - the booths are cramped and slightly uncomfortable, but it's all part of the experience! It's like a step back in time. Really, the only thing that jolts you back into the 21st century are the cool tatted-up kids that happen to be serving you.

Everything about the breakfast is good - bacon is extra crispy, eggs done right, coffee that is \"amazing\" (so I've heard) - but what really sets this place apart from the rest, other than its beautiful atmosphere, is their seriously mean Challah toast. Really, after a bite of this slightly sweet bread, I wonder why the heck other breakfast joints don't jump on this. With a spread of their delicious berry compote and mmmm.... you won't see any reject pieces of toast left to be taken away.

You pay at the front of the bar on your way out the door, and BAM, it's like a time jump back into the present ('Holey Moley! Is that a giant 40 foot Gerard Butler on top of the Adidas store?!?!') - but it sure is good to know that a little escapism from the madness of downtown is right there waiting for you, Challah toast in hand."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to grab meal... Excellent people serve possibly the greatest meal that one can have... Warmest greetings to the staff and the Chef. Will come again for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice historic spot in the old part of the city. Service was very kind."}
{"text":"The ambiance, decor and food makes it his my favourite place for breakfast.
The waiters are friendly and the food quite delicious.
I really love the pancakes and the fruity stuff.
Usually I go there for brunch on Sunday mornings with my favourite pal to get together and chest chat.
Nice place, very San Francisco style, recommended.
Also I love the old style cashier and the lamps and counter are to die for! Well at least in my personal opinion."}
{"text":"Wonderful old style breakfast diner 
Pea meal eggs Benny is a must as is the huevos rancheros.
A little pricey, always busy but a great experience in the big City."}
{"text":"Real cozy place. Service was exceptional! Everyone was so nice. Mac and cheese gratinee and carrot cake were the bomb."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch with great ambiance. Laid back staff. Although it comes a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The Senator is an all-meal restaurant located in the heart of downtown core. 

Going there for lunch, I had a \"Senator Burger\"; a generous, juicy 1/3 pound patty cooked to order on an egg bun with caramelized onions, dark lettuce, and fresh tomatoes. The meat was done just right, had excellent flavor, and the unusual egg bun was a delightful pairing. 

The service was great; they checked in only when we needed something, and were polite and knowledgeable about the menu. Great experience, and I see why this is a favorite! I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp after looking for top rated breakfast places near the downtown. The location is classic, right near Younge and Dundas and the Eaton Centre. The old style diner was cool.

The food was good but overpriced. It wasnt wow-ing for how much it cost. We came right before they were closing at 2p, and they were out of salmon which was in several of the dishes we were interested in. The waitress was nice, but was hurried with closing. I had the fish and chips, which tasted great, but felt like more chips than fish. I'm from Chicago and am used to getting more food for the kind of pricing of the dish, and have even gotten a larger amount of good food for the same price.

It was a cool place, cool location, just a little overpriced. I'd recommend the experience, maybe just not the prices."}
{"text":"Great old school diner.  Food was excellent.  Why 2 stars? We were there at 11:00 and were looking for lunch.  We were told that lunch didn't start until 11:30.  When we said we would wait, the server rolled his eyes and said \"we are really busy with the matinee today\" (theatre is across the street).  So, we ended up ordering breakfast to accommodate them.  Our male server was just generally a DB."}
{"text":"Their famous senator breakfast was OK. Maybe I had too high expectation. You can have the similar quality food for much cheaper in the US."}
{"text":"There was a long line out the doors, but our group of 4 was seated within 15-20 minutes. The service was great - our food arrived very quickly. I ordered the huevos rancheros. It was okay, although I will say the homemade corn bread was very tasty. I'd be willing to come back and try other dishes at some point."}
{"text":"The Senator is a pretty solid place for brunch! The decor is old skool, the service is great and the food is tasty! We got the huevos rancheros and the senator. I personally liked the senator breakfast much better!"}
{"text":"Everything is locally-sourced, homemade, and delicious! The atmosphere is quaint and cute, and the service is fantastic. It is fantastic for a relaxed morning!"}
{"text":"First place I became a \"regular\" at in Toronto. Probably mostly (but not entirely) because it was the first place in Toronto I had a crush on one of the waitresses. 

The breakfasts here are great- I'd usually go early morning before the rush, grab the standard Senator breakfast with 2 eggs, meat, beans, etc, etc. Coffee usually quite nice- as is the challah bread used for toast. (7.95 if you get there early enough)

My other fav breakfast menu item was the \"yogurt surprise\" which (you'll likely be happy to know) is not what it sounds like. It's actually just yogurt and fruit and granola. (10.95)

At lunch, go for a sandwich- they're all pretty good but I found the best to be:

Cubano: Slow Roasted Pork Loin, Avocado, Tomato, Chipotle Mayo on Sourdough (10.95)

Dinner: 
The menu gets pricier/fancier, so I'd usually just stick with the Senator Burger:
8 oz Cumbrae Naturally Raised Beef, Served with Sauteed Onions, Tomato, Lettuce, With Fries or Green Salad @ $14.

---
Overall, it's a good spot. The atmosphere and waitstaff are great. The real problem is that it's gets up there in price- so if you're a habitual breakfast eater-outer, it'll put a lil' more of a dent in your wallet than 2 McDonald's breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Went there before a show at Massey Hall last night. Waiter was nice but service was terrible. So slow.  Food was not great. Terrible value for a very expensive price. 4 people, 2 beers $225. Will
Never be going back"}
{"text":"Good size breakfast and the home made hot sauce is an absolute must! Seating is a little right but adds to the atmosphere"}
{"text":"It's just a diner.  Nothing that incredible, but it's solid food.  I was visiting the city and went there more for the history than anything, since it's the oldest restaurant in Toronto that's still in operation.

If you want cheap breakfast it's a good safe bet for sure.."}
{"text":"We had to be in Toronto at 8:00 AM this morning for a dental appointment on our Christmas vacation and we were looking for a good breakfast place afterwards. Checked out restaurants close by on Yelp and chose the Senator based on the reviews. Food is amazing. Just what you want from a diner. I had the classic - two poached eggs, pea meal bacon, baked beans, hash browns and toast. All delicious and the poached eggs were perfect. My daughter chose the blueberry pancakes - lots of delicious fluffiness. Caution: the portions are generous. We could not finish our meals. The next time you are by the Eaton Centre, skip the food court and pay the Senator a visit."}
{"text":"Was there right after a matinee show with three other women. Two of us ordered the fried chicken, which was supposedly soaked or marinated for 1 1/2 hours. Tough chicken, lacking flavor. Served with Brussels sprouts that we couldn't even get a fork in. Complained and brought us another serving of the same uncooked sprouts. Definitely will not be returning, and neither will my friends.
Shame."}
{"text":"The food was great. Typical breakfast fare with fast and friendly service. Easy to access via the subway. There were no lines when we arrived (9 on Sunday) but as we were leaving a line had already formed  

We had the egg scramble and the eggs Benedict. Both were very delicious. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visited here this morning late.  Had an excellent breakfast which they were happy to serve despite the time, 11am.

The place is a classic, set up diner style long and deep with tight seating up and down the main corridor.

We got off to a good start when they were more than happy to fix one of us a latte with almond milk.  Almond milk isn't easy to find even in a forward thinking city like Toronto.

Food was great, the pancakes didn't disappoint, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast after finding it here on yelp and everyone was very pleased. We would go back in a heartbeat.
Great tasting food, challah toast was particularly delicious, coffee was good and freshly squeezed orange juice. 
Staff was super friendly. I really can't think of an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"The food portions are huge!  The service is great!  The restaurant is narrow and seating is limited.  Be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"Old-fashioned diner. Excellent for lazy brunch. (I had forgotten it was Toronto's oldest! Very cool.)

+ I love the decor. It looks like my idea of the perfect diner. Booths are cozy, despite being close together.
+/- Place can get quite packed, and therefore, a little loud. It's a popular spot.
+ I haven't eaten anything that wasn't delicious on the menu.
+++++ For the HUGE hot chocolate (good price, AMAZING hot chocolate, it comes in a BOWL, basically) and is made with Kawartha dairy. I would come just for the hot chocolate.
- The past two times I've gone the service has been very lacking. One time in particular our server was actually rude. 

I will be going back. If you go, get a hot chocolate.
Prices are very decent as well. Quality for price is very good."}
{"text":"Liver is good for you. Especially when its topped with caramelized onions, bacon and sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes with steamed vegetables on the side. 

This authentic diner was recommended to me in a Yelp newsletter and I'm certainly glad I tried it. You get 15% if you check-in but make sure you tell the server BEFORE you order (read the fine print). 

As you can tell, I ordered the liver dinner entree which was juicy and oh-so-livery flavoured. The vegetables were standard steamed, and buttered.

The latte was decent and just strong enough but not too strong as I was still able to sleep that night. The diner serves organic milk which is thoroughly marketed on the menu but I couldn't really tell the difference in taste. But it certainly affects the price of anything dairy (ie. the tiny but tasty mac and cheese appetizer for $10).

The decor consists of some solid wood booths with coat hangers just like the ones you'd see in the 1920s. It was quiet on a Thursday night which made for a peaceful dinner nomming on some goooood liver!"}
{"text":"Due to the wage hike, they've increased prices by at least $3 per item and have discontinued many of the breakfast items as well. Some of the old favourites have been replaced by more expensive options. Two breakfast plates + two coffees come to $55. Quality and service are the same while food is at least 30-50% more expensive per item. I will not re-visit this restaurant for breakfast."}
{"text":"Gotta say, my expectations were a bit higher than what I got but I still had a good time. I went in for lunch one day and it was surprisingly busy for sit down place on a weekday. Our waiter was a super-friendly, super-cool, uber-hipster dude who one likes immediately. They have some really interestingly shaped booths; I like the feel of this place. 

But it goes a little down from there; my burger came without the advertised caramelized onions and corn relish, two main reasons why I ordered it in the first place. However the server was very apologetic and it was brought out right away after I asked. I tried the chilli as well which was deliciously nice and a bit spicy. Lukewarm, though. Maybe it's because the burger takes 20 minutes to be cooked? The bottomless coffee cups were never refilled, but the water was. I don't know, I'm confused, I wanted a bit more! 

Everyone was really nice and you get liquorice or Hershey's kisses when you pay the bill up front! Nevertheless, I did enjoy my meal and would still come back in hopes of an even better experience."}
{"text":"Arrived about 15 mins before my friend - had a coffee while waiting, as soon as my friend sat down we were asked what we wanted to order. We asked for a few minutes - waiter came back 2 seconds later asking again this happened at least 4 times we felt bullied into ordering.  Food was ok.  Since we hadn't seen each other in a while we chatted for a bit.  I asked for a coffee top up and was give a look!, coffee reluctantly was given. We were asked if we wanted anything else and the bill was shoved at us.  We had been in the restaurant for a total of 1hour when the waiter informed us it was time to leave as people were waiting.  RUDE.  I mentioned this when we paid the bill - apparently there is a time limit even though this is not posted anywhere.  I just thought it was quite rude and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was excellent! Place was packed but they sat us without a reservation. Found food for the kids, service was excellent. It's the oldest operating restaurant in Toronto and with one visit I see why. Frequented by theatre goers catching a show across the street...

Looking at the pictures, looks like it is just for brunch. I'm sure their brunch is incredible - but there is a lunch and dinner menu and they don't serve brunch/breakfast all day.

Highly recommended - a must on your visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Best breakfast on the planet! Coffee amazing, french toast made with challah awesome, bagel and lox platter worthy of Montreal, eggs with onions and smoked salmon made to perfection"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and it was amazing!! Had the \"Real Good Plate\", nothing on it wasn't great. Came with pancakes, bacon, home fries, eggs, beans, and toast... All great. Staff was good, bill was very average. 

Visiting from New York and it lived up to any breakfast you can have in New York"}
{"text":"Very quaint. I ordered liver and onions and my husband ordered a tuna sandwich. The sandwich was fine but nothing special. My meal was delicious. We also split a Caesar salad and it was very tasty. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite brunch locations.  They have great bagels!  The only knock on the place is that they don't have a good system for when they're full - it's not really clear who's next, how long it's going to take, and there's nowhere comfortable to sit or stand while waiting.

Warning - I've never been for dinner so I can't comment, my rating only applies to brunch."}
{"text":"Cute old diner atmosphere! The pancakes are amazing! The eggs, bacon and sausages are average and portion sizes are small for those items which makes them not worth the price. I wouldn't recommend going there for an eggs & bacon kind of breakfast, but if you're looking for great pancakes or French toast and willing to spend a bit, this is the place. The service is okay."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of scoring a single seat at the bar on a busy show night where The Senator was booked solid - be sure to call ahead and reserve if you plan to have a table waiting on a multi-show night! Walking in as a single seat made it easy to find a seat. 
My hostess/waitress/companion for the evening was Michelle... I hope you are so lucky to experience her hospitality - she is dynamite and made the evening with her banter and accommodations. She juggled her duties as bartender, waitress, hostess, and Jane-of-all-trades with grace and aplomb. She made the evening. 
The Caesar salad was uninspired (a piece of romain lettuce with salad dressing and croutons on the side. It was edible, but nothing to write home about... So Mom hasn't heard about it yet. 
The steak frites didn't offer a huge portion, but the steak was cooked very well (close to perfection) and the au jus was very tasty with the frites. 
Michelle went above and beyond when the dessert menu proved uninspiring for me -- she asked me what I wanted and accommodated me by creating an ice cream sundae concoction that's as not on the menu. She proved to me that the dining experience wasn't always a selection on the menu, but the experience of being welcomed and understood. 
All in all, the evening at the Senator was very positive - I would return again, likely foregoing the salad appetizer, but most certainly returning in hopes Michelle will be there to serve me again."}
{"text":"The Senator has been around forever and its a great vintage space. I'd like to give it a better review but my recent experience was just OK. 9.95 for a toasted western (renamed the Roasted Western) and a few pieces of home fries is too much.  The bread was also barely toasted.  Coffee was a bit weak and barely warm.  
Perhaps the rest of the menu for breakfast is better."}
{"text":"Our flights were canceled due to weather so we decided to stay downtown for a couple of days. We live in a foodie town - Charleston,  South Carolina - and know good food and service.  The Senator was just around the corner from our hotel.  It had good reviews on Yelp so we gave it a try.  My wife order the fried chicken and I had the burger.  They had 3 local craft beers on tap. I had a Beau's.  The food was delicious.  The burger was very tasty and came from a local provider.   The service was exemplary.  Our server even provided a to go container of mixed fruit for our son unprompted.  We went back the next morning for breakfast and had the French Toast and egg plate, also delicious.   I look forward to returning one day."}
{"text":"I went to the Senator for a Yelp event where we got to sample many dinner course dishes.  Nothing was bad, but it wasn't really outstanding either.  The burger with caramelized onion was quite good as was their coffee, but everything else (the hot dog, chips & guacamole, strawberry creme brulee, mac & cheese) left me pretty indifferent.  I might return to sample their brunch, however, since the staff was very nice.  In addition, the whole place has a nice atmosphere even though the booths are quite small so I felt a bit crammed in there.

 I hope to be able to return to assess their brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and plenty of it! The first time my friend and I went, we had an amazing, friendly, chatty and funny server. Love everything about the Senator and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Walked in for brunch around 1pm and there was 5-6 couples waiting to be seated.   Within 15 minutes, we (myself+1) sat in a booth.  While I was waiting I examined the old school menu from when The Senator opened in 1948 which kept me busy.  The waiter was friendly and immediately brought us our coffee and water.  I got the benedict popeye (eggs Benedict with spinach).  Instead of an english muffin it was served on a homemade biscuit that was out of this world!   Date got steak and eggs which came with baked beans and home fries.  Both our eggs were cooked perfectly and we each cleaned our plates.  I will be back there again!"}
{"text":"Perfectly subpar breakfast served by a kind of annoyed, rushed and stressed waitress. I don't blame her; working at a restaurant sucks but the food also sucked. For $12 I ordered the 2 egg breakfast and it came with lukewarm maple baked beans and weird damp lumpy home fries that tasted microwaved. The blueberry compote jam for the toast was probably the best. The coffee is decent but just order for takeout. I wouldn't come back for food, no one should mess up breakfast this bad."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of The Senator, but this place is now SERIOUSLY pricy. My staple, Eggs Benedict, used to cost $14 but since the minimum wage increase is now a ludicrous $20. I get that costs have increased across the board, but a $6 increase is a bit much.

The food is still as good as always, as is the service. I just wish us non-millionaires weren't being priced out of visiting more regularly.

The Senator is now reserved for special occasions only, since $50 (before tip) for two egg dishes and a coffee is simply too much to stomach."}
{"text":"We visited the Senator twice when we were in Toronto over the holidays.  Classic diner seating which is a little tight.  In spite of this, we were seated quickly and the staff was very friendly and relaxed.  We had breakfast both times and the food was outstanding.  The decor and ambience is a bit of Toronto history and should not be missed.  Our only issue was the washroom which is down a narrow flight of stairs.  Since the building and the restaurant are so old, I assume this was original and can't be changed."}
{"text":"What can I say that already has not been said about this place! After walking by a few Sundays and seeing they were totally packed - my boyfriend and I were lucky enough to snag two seats at the bar. Amazing coffee, huge portions and fresh squeezed orange juice. We loved it and hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Cool place for Sunday breakfast but the food was just ok and the price is way too high. $4.25 for a small glass of orange juice."}
{"text":"Take a step back in time, and enter The Senator.  Tucked in on Victoria St, just off Yonge/Dundas Square, this diner will make you feel like you are in a different era.  While the booths are a little small, the experience is anything but!

We came during the lunch rush, but we're able to grab a small booth at the back.  The service was quick and friendly, and we had our meals within 10 minutes of sitting down.  Both the Roasted Western and Senator Club we ordered were huge and definitely filling.

If you are ever looking for a piece of nostalgia that serves great food then consider The Senator, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place on weekdays. They have a specialty breakfast for $10.99. It used to be $7.99 though. The ingredients are always fresh and made in house. They try to use as much organic food as they can."}
{"text":"Very rude server. We were very rushed, and heard our server complaining that we were not ordering breakfast. Two seven-dollar smoothies and three coffees cost us $25, which our waiter took out of our hands as we were counting it. Glad to leave."}
{"text":"Convenient historical diner turned hipster brunch and dinner spot off of Ryerson. 

I've always wanted to check out this place after going by the retro neon sign many times, and seeing 30s films being filmed inside. Finally I had a chance and I was pleasantly surprised. Inside is all wood booths and old style decor with jazz art and a historic Coke sign which outdoes hipster spots because it's all original here. 

For dinner, they get rid of their traditional brunch menu in favour of a mostly prix fixe dinner menu, with a number of items for the same price. When asked whether I should get the beef short ribs or duck, she confidently said ribs so I got that. Friend got the blue cheese burger. Burger was done rare and was reported to taste great. Short ribs was generously portioned with a big hunk of beef, similar to that found in O&B a while back. 

Service definitely had a hipster vibe to it, with the requisite look on the waitstaff. Would come back again to try the brunch."}
{"text":"We come here whenever we're in toronto - for an amazing breakfast with really good coffee. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you go to because its a landmark. Same reason I went, woke up one morning and was too lazy to cook. The Senator is close to my place so my husband and I went gave it a try.

They serve latte in the most humongous cup (more like a bowl) and its amazing! For breakfast I had the Huevos Rancheros which was delicious. I have never tried corn bread before but its nice :) The chorizo and black beans were very nice too. My husband had an omelette and was ok, my dish was better. The Challah toast was really good (tried it because of the reviews and it was totally worth it). 

Although I liked what I ate, my husband didn't and that makes me think this place could be a hit/miss depending on what you order. 

And because of that, I may/may not go back. Definitely worth one try though, for the sake of history ;)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:30pm, there were 5~6 people waiting already. The waiter told me the waiting time was about 15~20min, which is not bad at all. I didn't notice how long I waited.

I ordered fresh orange juice and Senator Club House -- it's a chicken sandwich. It was OK..  its actually the first time i had freshly squeezed juice in Toronto..

The server was nice. I would go again."}
{"text":"I am not one for diners and brunches because they always inevitably disappoint me somehow.

Not this one! The steak and eggs was a decent portion of REAL steak and REAL eggs fried in butter, although I did not care for the beans, it was no big loss to push them aside.

I also very much like having Wifi available in the restaurant, and finished the meal with 3 pancakes that had a delicious fruit compote on the side and maple syrup.

(Yes, I ate two breakfasts).

For about $36 (tax and tip included), I walked away full, although you can probably score it cheaper if you aren't a pig like me."}
{"text":"I can only rate this place based on the space, menu and suppliers. After eating downstairs at The Senator, we climbed the stairs to check it out. Lovely space, nice French bakery/bistro style menu, and they get their pastries (scones, croissants etc.) from great local bakers. Can't wait to go back to try it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have never been to The Senator before. I always imagined it was an old pub/bar rather than a fresh, vibrant and buzzing diner. Came in on a Saturday around 11am and had about a 10 minute wait for two of us. Considering it was Mother's Day weekend, that wasn't too bad at all. They had a Mother's Day weekend event where they were donating 10% of each bill to the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. It gave us even more of a reason to wait. 

We were greeted with cheerful and happy staff. That's always a good sign. If the staff is happy, then the customers are usually happy as well!

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (eggs, chorizo, black beans, tomato, salsa, avocado and homemade cornbread) and a macchiato. My bf ordered the Real Good Plate (eggs, bacon, buttermilk pancake, homefries, maple baked beans and challah toast) and a coffee. The food arrived fairly quickly after we received our drinks. All in all about a 10-15 minute wait on the food from time of ordering. Considering the place was packed, that was pretty damn fast!

First thing to mention about the food we ordered: BEST BUTTERMILK PANCAKE EVER!!!!!! We spent most of the meal talking about the pancake and what could possibly be in it that makes it so amazing. We really wanted that recipe :P When we go back, it's going to be a full pancake order that's for sure. Second thing to mention is that all our food was super fresh and much better quality than your average diner. I later read online that they use a lot of local ingredients from 40 different suppliers. Pretty nuts!

In conclusion, we will be back for sure. Now all I can think about is that pancake with the 100% pure maple syrup on the side..."}
{"text":"I bookmarked a few spots before I headed to Toronto and I must have found this place on a list somewhere... It didn't disappoint. I walked over from our hotels with a group of friends and the exterior was perfect...very vintage and welcoming. We arrived about an hour before they closed and our waiter was personable and fun. 

We had a variety of items from apps for dinner to a burger to a steak dinner + beers...and a mimosa for me. No I did not care that it was night time. Everything came out quickly and we all loved our meals. When the waiter heard that 2 of us were from Louisiana, he brought over a housemade spicy condiment...not really a sauce, more like a pepper relish or a chutney. It was spicy and tasty. 

Of course, since we were in such a great diner, we had to ask about dessert if it wasn't too late. Delicious apple crumble, carrot cake, brownie and a sticky toffee pudding. We probably could have shared 2 of these but we were being piglets. 

Our server told us that were normally packed on weeknights because of the theater across the street so we were lucky that it was dark on the night we went. It's a small spot so definitely get a reservation on a weekend. 

Worth the visit for the ambiance and the staff! And the food was pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"Came in last Monday and had the 9oz burger with salad. Delicious flawless cumbrae beef and fresh garnishes. Now back fir lunch as we speak and ordered mac and cheese. Service is very friendly and enthusiastic. Mac and cheese now in frobt of me. Fusilli oasta with great cheese mix and breadcrumbs on top. Salad is fresh and crisp with carrots, mixed greens and a refreshing vinaigrette. Overall great lunch and great price at 9.95!"}
{"text":"Despite a packed restaurant, the service and food was impeccable.

Came here with the significant other's parents. It was a 15 minute wait at noon on a weekend so it wasn't that bad at all.

The food was fantastic. I don't usually care for pancakes but the  buttermilk pancake I received with my meal was absolutely perfect. I enjoyed every part of my meal, from the baked beans to the bacon to the over easy eggs and toast. Nothing was burnt or over cooked and all tasted wonderful. 

The restaurant was absolutely packed but the service was fantastic. Our server ensured our coffee was always refilled. We never had to wait for him to come around and he was attentive and friendly.

I'm very impressed with how the Senator handled it's peak. A lot of other restaurants could follow their example."}
{"text":"It's a solid choice for breakfast. It's no fancy shmancy restaurant but I'm always happy to go back. Fresh squeezed oj and grapefruit juice and the french toast is solid and coffee cup is full. 
Now I just have to go back for a lunch...."}
{"text":"I had not been to the Senator for so many years.  I went on Saturday July 11 2015.  It was even better than before.  Still the same old charm and wonderful staff.  I was so pleased to see that there had not been any renovations to this fabulous old diner.
I will not wait so many years again.  I want to try everything on this varied menu."}
{"text":"really charming.  the seating was vintage and cute, the food was very good quality--I would not call it a \"greasy spoon\" by any means.  Beautifully preserved and cozy"}
{"text":"The Senator was down the street from our hotel so we decided to check it out.  I guess a lot of people like this place because of its history?  That's cool and all, but I rate a place based on its food and service.  

Walking in here felt like stepping back in time.  But it was back in time with free wifi!  The booths are very old school, and the restroom is located downstairs through creaky stairs.  If I had to guess this place was built around the early 1900s. 

I ordered the Senator Breakfast which was bacon, toast, eggs, potatoes, and beans.  It was very ordinary, like something I would make myself.  For that reason I give this place three stars.  The staff was very friendly however and there is free WiFi."}
{"text":"I try to come to the Senator at least twice a month for breakfast. I find it be an almost spiritual experience. It makes me calm and happy. Eating here reassures me that everything in my life is okay and will probably get better. It also makes me feel as though I belong in the city and this is home. 

The food is reasonably priced and service is adequate."}
{"text":"This was a post-TFC downtown Yelp-search find the other day while looking for some quick diner food. When we first got there our priorities were more along the lines of WASHROOM! WASHROOM!, but once we took care of that we were more than a little intrigued by this busy, but well staffed diner. The menu is pretty brief with 6-10 each of apps, mains, and dessert, but everything looked good and there wasn't a lot of overlap in terms of types of foods/flavours. The restaurant itself is also pretty cool with old coke machines and napkin dispensers, lots of wood everywhere and some cool artwork on the walls. Has a classic feel to it without feeling old.
I had the braised beef short rib on a bed of mashed potatoes with some julienned carrots and parsnips(?) on the side all surrounded by an incredibly flavourful gravy. The worst thing I can say about this dish is that there WASN'T ENOUGH! Haha. The beef just fell apart, the mashed potatoes and gravy were great and even the veggies on the side left me wanting more. It was also pretty perfectly portioned and plated. Not too big, but more than filling and it made me hungry just to look at it.
My buddy Phil's burger looked pretty awesome too. Big and greasy. And, until I tasted my dish, I was a little jealous! Next time...
Also, it was pretty packed and we were lucky to get seated as fast as we did, so make reservations if you're planning on going during prime hours.
If I lived a little closer or was going to school at Ryerson, I could see this place becoming a regular hangout. There's nothing wrong with a shorter menu if everything is top notch. I'll definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant. Very authentic style. Went on Memorial Day so it was packed with Americans. Enjoyed a nice breakfast and the waitress was quick and nice."}
{"text":"I love the history of this place. I like to sit and think about all the people that have walked through the doors over the years. Some famous, some notorious, and some just like you and me.  I've only ever gone here for lunch and breakfast and found the food to be ok, the service mediocre and the policy unwelcoming (no substitutes).  Hard to believe a restaurant could survive today with no substitutes. It is still worth a trip down, to be able to sit and enjoy a meal in a piece of Toronto's history."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch in a convenient location with fabulous service. Super easy to get to by public transit right by young Dundas square!

Polite and attentive service, waiters came
By asked multiple times for coffee refills and water.

I got the eggs Benedict sans meat and asked for sautéed mushrooms instead, they accommodated my request at no extra cost. The eggs Benny was bomb atop of a nice homemade biscuit. A hundred times better than an English
 muffin.

Definitely will be back! yum!"}
{"text":"I want to start off first by letting everyone know that this review is only based off of the 2 dishes my husband and I had for breakfast and not the service. 
The gals who took care of us were very sweet and polite and didn't even know that we weren't feeling the food. 

I saw that the heuevos breakfast was a popular choice , I don't eat sausage links but will eat chorizo served in this very popular breakfast dish (pretty much every where it is offered, everywhere I go) so when the plate came to the table and I saw a giant ball park Frank hot dog looking sausage starring and me I wasn't too thrilled,  along side some lonely looking back beans and a few slices of beefsteak tomato and a few slices of avocado and some eggs I knew I had made the wrong choice. I decided to give the sausage a go.....bad idea. It tasted like ground up rubber and did not taste like the parts of an animal that should be eaten. That one bite repeated on my poor stomach for hrs after. 

Husband ordered a traditional breakfast,  not too shabby but absolutely nothing to write home about. Honestly , the best part of the meals was the sourdough bread that came with my husband's meal.

The good news is that thankfully it wasn't my last meal (which is always a fear after I have a bad meal) 

Who knows the restaurant could have some other great dishes but I would skip breakfast the next time I go."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered an omelette and also french toast to split. Both were wonderful. Coffee was just okay, and my friend thought her orange juice tasted weird. Really fun and interesting spot though. Staff was rude."}
{"text":"Love it!!  I can't even explain how you feel when you walk in and see the old fashioned bar stools...sort of like Back to the Future movie.  Nothing has changed.  The food is delicious, the place is filled with nostalgia.  Try getting out without buying one of the cookies at the check out...good luck....I had the old fashioned breakfast and it was sooooo delightful.  It definitely called for a nappy afterwards...what is better than breakfast and hitting the hay for another hour...ummm, nothing, that's what!!!"}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood and my whole office used to get takeout from here all the time. They recently raised the prices and now a sandwich is $18. The food is good, but considering it's diner food, that's outrageous. I won't go here any more, which is sad."}
{"text":"Typical diner food with a good atmosphere and friendly staff.  BUT the desserts are inredible! We wish we would have tried The Senator or first day there so we would not have had to try every dessert in one day since we could not make up our minds.  The carrot cake was moist with real cream cheese froating.  The cookies and brownies were perfect chocolaty goodness.  The Senator is worth the visit."}
{"text":"The GOODIE:
it got taken off the bill( we tipped well to show our appreciation). Their pancakes taste amazing! Service is Great!

The OOPSIE:
The waitress brought the wrong dish; which turned out to taste much better than what we had originally ordered!

The UH-NO:
Open-faced omelette with salmon and brie. one word: blah... and i could say even less for the brie since it was almost non existent.."}
{"text":"Food is amazing.. Cozy atmosphere and great deals for students it is great for a quick breakfast and you always have a warm welcome. Challah toast is worth coming back for and the best I have had. It has recently turned in a \"lounge\" so it's swankied up the breakfast menus to be minimum brunch only. I miss the early bird breaky offer!!! Owner is very friendly and makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Really cute retro style diner with great food! Came here for Sat brunch with a friend, had to wait for some time though because it was pretty busy. The waitress was friendly and quick to serve us. Tried the smoked salmon eggs & benny as well as the breakfast special with blueberry pancakes, ham, maple glazed baked beans, challah toast and eggs. The pancakes were beyond fluffy and the toast was amazing! Portion size was huge so the pricier order was worth it. The coffee was on point as well, came with fresh milk! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice spot for brunch or to grab a coffee. I haven't been for breakfast in awhile but from what I remember, the breakfast was very tasty. 

I love the ambiance and the 1940s feel. Its like a relic of the past in an area that is super modern. 

Recently i have come to grab a coffee and a pastry on my way to work.  Very decent place.  



."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and authentic historic narrative. Sat at the bar and found everyone attentive and charming. Omelette had as much flavour as day-old tossed salad. Recommend bringing your own coffee."}
{"text":"Had to update to minus a star for that peter fellow insulting my intelligence with his same empty apology he writes on every negative review,  hey peter you guys arent the only ones with fresh squeezed orange juice for $4+ , you guys are however the only place ive been to, that puts it in a toddler sized portion, and i doubt you looked into anything, probably congratulated your cooks on a job well done keeping the portions as small as can be, like seriously? How do you look a customer in the face and justify giving them small portions of everything you can? Go to Bam breakfast or sneaky dees to see a restaurant who is more concerned with their customers having a good meal rather than squeezing every dollar they can out of them. See what they give for $20 + tip. And if their meal was in the shape yours was, they wouldnt give me some pre packaged empty apology, they would offer to right the issue. Which you in all your replies tob reviews, have failed to do."}
{"text":"I have lived so close to the Senator for years and years, but never been.

Place feels like diners that you'd find in Times Square - same level of food, service, decor and an easy location to many tourist attractions that downtown Toronto has to offer.

Walked in on a Sunday for brunch just before 2 pm; no wait for a booth but the place was full.  Noise level was extremely high, and I rarely notice these things.

Service felt amateurish but I'm sure they weren't.  Milk for my coffee came with chunks floating in it...I sent it back, but a while later our waitress came back and explained it was organic, 4% milk and that's why the appearance was chunky.  Maybe, but I'm not sure why if someone wants milk, they'd want homo milk - might as well get cream (which is what I ended up using).  

Omelette was lacking in fluffiness and \"chili sauce\" on the side tasted too sweet and didn't compliment the meal well.  Liked the side peameal bacon and sausage ($3 extra each).  Challah toast was good too, but wouldn't have minded some jam to accompany.  Liked that they had ketchup on the table already.

Bathrooms were dismal."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast here, set in an old historic building, this 50's style diner and their attentive staff serve fresh and very delicious breakfasts and dinners. The food is pretty creative and well presented. But portions seem to be on the small side.

It's very busy and small, so you may need to wait for a good seat.

Although this place serves very good food, it's also fairly expensive, especially for breakfast.

But As pricey as this place is, the food is good so i didn't complain too much :)"}
{"text":"Their Challah toast has got to be the most delicious toast around! Fantastic value, portions that leave you satisfied, and super friendly service! If I lived closer  I'd be here every Sunday for brunch. Truly a gem."}
{"text":"I fcking loved the guy who waited our table literally was the nicest waiter I've ever met or had in my entire life. The chicken pot pie was so creamy and hot so perfect. The salad with balsamic vinaigrette paired with it was refreshing. The coffee was brewed nicely and we got as much cream and refills as we'd like; it was perfect on the cold day we went in for. Will come back for a cozy date again!!!"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned breakfast. Portions were good and price was reasonable. Coffee was pretty good. Food tasted wholesome. Service was just average. Good location. I would come back."}
{"text":"It was our last day in Toronto and we were in the mood for a big, delicious breakfast! That's exactly what we got!

There was a bit of line up but being it a Saturday morning, it was to be expected. 

Once we sat down the service was great but found the food to be a little lack luster. I got the big breakfast and as you can expect it was the usual suspects: eggs, bacon, beans, toast, hash and pancakes. I decided to sub out the toast for a cheese biscuit (which was the best part of the meal) and decided to add on some pancakes. I think for the price of  the the switch ($3), it was a little expensive but worth it.

Overall my eggs were a little overdone and the potato hash lacked a personality and any crispy ends. I usually like my hash to be crispy and well done, so you get that crunch but this has didn't have a lot of flavor but was better than anything you get at Denny's or Ihop!"}
{"text":"Had the Real Good Plate for my first outside brunch in year 2016, and it was really good! It gives you a taste of everything (pancakes, toasted challah bread, maple baked beans, eggs and bacons). 

Love the pancakes especially, so fluffy and milky, yet the texture was not sticky at all.

The maple syrup baked beans tastes special too.

Must try their strawberry jam, put on the challah bread - it's so good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday at 10am. We were a group of 4 but 2 of us showed up earlier than our latecomer friends. We were told we could not be seated until all members of the party were there so we had to wait for our friends to get there. It was a bit of an inconvenience but I guess it's because the place is so small. The old school diner decor is nice but this place is tiny with the smallest booths I've ever seen.

When all of us got there, we were seated right away. I got a mimosa and eggs benedict with home fries. Best eggs benny I've ever had! The home fries were too salty. The service was good. As we were leaving, there was a line up of people waiting for a table. I would suggest going for an early brunch to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers! I was looking for a good breakfast after Sunday Mass (and a rocking organ piece) at St. Michael's and was directed to this iconic downtown jewel. Place was super friendly, super clean. Fast service and excellent coffee. The menu was your familiar diner breakfast/brunch classics, very nicely done, with a few updated touches. The strawberry preserve and tasty multi-grain bread were outstanding. My Omega-3 eggs were perfect. The local bacon and beans were great. Not a drop of greasy or a hit of crusty, all cooked to perfection. A little Shirley Bassie and Barry Manilow in the background - great Sunday morning score. GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"I do love going to the Senator, tucked away behind Y/D Square.  Lunches are always extremely busy and today was no different.  I had the Club, I normally do when I come here. I think it has even improved since last time!  Was a couple of perfectly cooked and seasoned chunky breasts on bread that was almost sweet..  must have been egg bread or something, don't know.. just good stuff!  They also have a few beers on tap including Beau's Lug Tread."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch during our trip, choose it based on Yelp reviews.  Hands down outstanding service.  Food was fantastic as well.  

We had a party of 14 going for breakfast, six were kids.  The service was outstanding.  The owner didn't bat an eye when we walked in, the place is a little tight, we weren't expecting they could seat us in a timely manner, but they did.  The owner even gave our last party, an extra few minutes to arrive...we expected they would not seat  them right away, they did!!!!  

The food was very good.  Our server was even better.  We had multiple requests, because all the kids were at or table, he wasn't phased by any of our requests.  

This place is kid friendly, has great service, and good food!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My granny likes this place, I like it and kids like it. What's not to like? This is an authentic diner with loads of Toronto history. It's close to my workplace and I have recently been prompted to go more often by the lovely event I experienced the other week. The food is of higher quality than you would expect from a typical diner-  you won't be eating defrosted and microwaved day-old cherry pie or anything. The charm of this place goes beyond just the history and friendly staff. The food is good.

They have recently partnered with local food companies for their organic milk and their coffee. It's great and I basically morph into Twin Peaks' Agent Cooper when I'm drinking it.

\"This is, excuse me, a DAMN fine cup of coffee.\"

\"Daaamn good coffee and hot!\"

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EsqvYBeyws

...Okay moving on, their eggs and salmon are extra fresh; they use Crumbrae's meat for their burgers, kobe beef for their hot dogs etc.  This is quality comfort food in a damn fine setting."}
{"text":"Really nice place, great food and service! Looks and feels like a traditional diner... All the breakfasts are good!!"}
{"text":"A late review. I first gave Senator a try when a close friend of mine vouched for her favorite brunch place in Toronto. I ordered blueberry pancakes but I was served regular pancakes instead. The server was very apologetic and when the bill came I was expecting nothing more than an adjustment to my bill. To my surprise, the server gave me 50% off my meal for the mix-up! He was obviously not obligated to but it was really kind of him, and subsequently the restaurant, to provide such superb service! The pancakes were delicious btw - will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I liked the Senator. I am surprised at the fact that they haven't made this place a huge tourist stop because it is said to be the oldest restaurant in Toronto. I ordered the chili omelet. I really enjoyed the chili but not the eggs. Next time I would just order the chili by it self. I asked for a piece of cornbread to go with my omelet and it was pretty good.

I like the concept of this place and would like to come back during my next visit in Toronto. Like a lot of the restaurants here, they try to use fresh local ingredients. And to my surprise, the chili was made with shredded beef and not grounded beef. YUM!

This place is pretty small, so come early to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"Very homey feel. Came here 2 weekends in a row and found it packed - couldn't find a table. Decided to come earlier the 3rd week (ie. before brunch time). Got served right away. Poached eggs with spinach was delish.. bit skimpy on the potatoes though."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken Club sandwich! What a huge piece of chicken!! Great staff! I think the prices are worth it considering the quality of food and quantity of food. Weekends are nuts trying to get in for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"One of the ways you get a 5 star review from me is when you have a very unique thing going on.
So NOT ONLY is this the only old style diner that is actually quite a solid piece of Toronto's history, but they have a full proper English breakfast (delicious beans and all) and REALLY proper sausage.
Bonus for incredible prices that don't gouge you in a central place in Toronto.
And extra bonus for amazing service and liquorice at the cashier til

One of my favourite breakfast places.  It's not fancy- but it's the basics done incredibly well."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for history! Plus psychology, anthropology, archaeology, astronomy, sociology, palaeontology, pathology, and of course, gastronomy...

OKAY... so I digress, the point is: I like the fact The Senator is Toronto's oldest diner and because of it, I really, really, R-E-A-L-L-Y wanted to like it.  Alas, this locale, sans it's picturesque history is nothing more than average. 

I took someone here a few weeks ago, and granted the place is cute in that 1960's kinda decour but her Eggs Benedict were, well, atrocious. The recipe was just badly executed and it tasted salty and sour. The Hollandaise if it could be called that was sub par at best. She is really too nice a person (don't know why) to send it back and so we shared some of my French Toasts which unfortunately were so sweet that I am still waiting for the Type 2 Diabetes to hit me like a Mack truck...you know, any day now.  

Their egg dishes are average at best. Sure they are not bad but I had the same quality at Jonny G's or The Coach House but for 40% less. 

I attended a Yelp event here a few days ago and again, the decour is very good. I find it charming and spot on but not enough to loose your head over. However the food, although well intentioned was still just okay. Their crab cakes tasted a bit better than store bought and as far as their Mac and Cheese, my companion said she could easily make better. Sliders were good but not exceptional. So all in all, the restaurant suffers specially when you pick up a menu and compare their prices to the competition.

Oh Senator, I appreciate they open silly-early in the morning, you know, for a real breakfast however in the end, the major factor is the food and why come here when you will get the same quality at multiple other places less than a 15 minute walk for less? Okay, maybe those other places may not have opened in 1929... but I can live with that. 

At least, I will really enjoy my eggs Benny then."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed by this highly rated restaurant. If a brunch place cannot get their $18 pancake and hash browns right, I really have no kind words to say! One star for location and one star for getting grilled cheese right!"}
{"text":"Just moved from NYC to Toronto and found this place on yelp.  Loved the old school decor, and the staff are great!   Very helpful and friendly.  Sat at the bar for brunch twice for good measure. Fantastic freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Found the food to be fairly middle of the road.  Passable definitely but nothing noteworthy."}
{"text":"This place is pretty run down but it's got a good traditional theme and cubical tables for privacy. Service is slow and the menu options aren't that great."}
{"text":"We had a nice Sat dinner during a four day trip to Toronto. After reading Yelp reviews, I called around 5 pm to make a reservation and was told they don't schedule reservations after 7:30, just come in and there should no trouble getting a table, which turned out to be true. The restaurant is near the Mirvish theater and it gets busy before shows so it would be a good idea to call about the need for a reservation. 

The vibe is upscale old school charming diner. They have a full bar, although I don't think that's advertised on their web site. 

The staff are very friendly and appear to get along well. I had the vegetable curry after the server said the chef is Indian. It was pretty good but not as good as what I'd get from a decent Indian restaurant...but I wasn't at a decent Indian restaurant! It was a tad pricey at $24 but I would definitely go back to try more dishes. 

Hubby had the mussels and received a huge portion that would have fed 2-3 folks. He liked it. 

The chef was kind enough to prepare the youngest an off menu grilled cheese and fries since that's what she was craving. 

#1 had the lemon garlic chicken and said it was good. 

One of the servers let the kiddos pick candy from the candy case and gave us the last piece of coconut cream pie in the glass pie dish. The servers probably sized us up as generous tourists and chatted with us about what we had been doing since arriving in Toronto. Dining out is always more enjoyable when the restaurant staff appear to like each other and their jobs. Kudos to the staff for making us feel at home!"}
{"text":"Step back in time to the 60's .. Start with a cup of freshly brewed coffee and organic milk/cream - yum!  Fresh squeezed orange juice also a treat.  Our family of four shared buttermilk pancakes, French toast made with challah bread, and eggs Benedict with side of potatoes  - with it!"}
{"text":"Old fashioned simple goodness. Fresh ingredients, good food, good service. I wish there were more places like this! 

Put simply, this place really cuts the crap and gets to the point. They serve all the classics and a few twists but they're all in all consistent and dependable which is what keeps people come back!

My wife had a hot tea and the french toast which was delicious. I had a regular breakfast egg plate with peameal bacon. It was fresh, delicious and cooked just right!!

No complaints here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I came back with a friend for steak and eggs as well as another dish.  The steak was ordered medium and came out very well done.  My friend was told well after their order was placed that one of their items was out of stock. They also made a mistake on my friend's order once it came out.  Though  they did correct it when it was brought to their attention. Overall the experience was better than last time but still a disappointment."}
{"text":"Loved the Senator burger & salad!  Cumbrae  farm beef on a Sesame Seed Eggbread.   Fried onions & corn relish.  Fresh garden salad with balsamic vinegar dressing was light & tasty.  My buddy order a Club House with fries.   There was a full chicken breast inside with bacon on a egg bread.    The giant $3 chocolate cookie was cool to share.  Thanks for the rum & butter LifeSavers!  I'll be back for the burger again!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS incredible. GREAT service, 1950s interior, this place is so neat it gives me the chills to be inside! A place with real character from bygone era! The pancakes are to DIE FOR, buttermilk, Caramel and Banana, really ALL the pancakes! They come with REAL maple syrup and plenty of melted sweet butter. And you MUST try the fantastic eggs Benedict - this is some grade A food."}
{"text":"We ate at the French restaurant Upstairs at The Senator. It was wonderful. I had duck which I really enjoyed & everyone else in our party enjoyed their meals. We were served a complimentary \"amuse bouche\" - delightful. The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"The customer service was AMAZING. They were so sweet and happy early In the morning. Definitely recommend the benedicts!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.   They make the French toast with locally baked Challah bread and it is amazing..  Served with hot REAL maple syrup and some fruit compote ( pineapple and apple-- very nice touch!). The bacon was crisp like I requested and the service was amazing.  Thanks Zara!!!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The senator used to be one of my favourite brunch spots downtown, but has gone way downhill since trying to become more \"upscale\".
They used to serve great breakfast staples at affordable prices and have amazing diner coffee. Now, they charge way more money for fewer selections that taste no better (and in fact taste worse) than what they used to serve. They've also switched to some overpriced hipster coffee which is way worse than the old stuff. 

Bottom line: I miss the old senator!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Homemade jam! FRESH ingredients! Cordial staff! Challah toast! Beautiful baked goods! Note; the place is fairly small."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Senator for brunch on Sundays, at exactly the wrong time, with a group of about 15 each time. Strangely, I can't recall waiting longer than 15 - 20 minutes with them splitting us into groups of 4 or so but all seated in the same general area. 

The food has always been pretty good.  I think I've had only egg platters - nothing outstanding and nothing bad has come of this. The service has been fast. I always seem to recall that the servers always have a slight little hint of an attitude, but that could also be due to the strange hungover mix of Americans, Canadians, Australians and Norwegians (I'm placing most of the blame on the Norwegians) that they're dealing with when I see them. This annoyance is in addition to the rest of the packed restaurant. 

I'd give it a go if the other places you like right around there are closed on Sundays or the wait isn't too long.  Seems like a great place for breakfast during the week when it's not too crowded."}
{"text":"So I stop here as wait at Uncle Tetsu got me hungry and this was on my list. While this place is know for breakfast, I was pass breakfast hour and wasn't interested in all day breakfast option.

So I went with senator burger which was good.The patty meat was juicy and tasty it just lack with lettuce and tomato but that was put on side so that can just not be eaten next time. Despite the swiss cheese was 2 buck extra it was melt and so good as an add so I don't regret that.

Their fries were meh... not good but not bad. All and all a good meal. 

I can see why this place has been around as long it has been and how often to get served soda in glass bottle remind you of 50's diner despite it older than that."}
{"text":"Over-priced for dinner. The website still has a review touting the top chef, but our server said he left years ago and it shows. $16 crab cakes were two cold and mushy mouthfuls on a wilted piece of romaine lettuce. $12 \"roasted\" beet salad was four or five slices straight from the jar with two forkfuls of goat cheese on limp greens. $32 steak came with limp \"frites\" that were actually shoestring fries, and unseasoned steamed vegetables. It may be good for a diner breakfast, but there are literally hundreds of better dinner options within a kilometre."}
{"text":"Everything about the experience was great. Almost all of the reviews are for breakfast (gonna have to try that), but we enjoyed a great dinner.  Food and service was great."}
{"text":"After all the reviews I read about the huevos rancheros it sounded like it would be right up my alley however I was really disappointed. The black beans were really tasty but the salsa was mediocre and the cornbread was whatever. My friend claimed it was the greatest peameal bacon he's ever had and loved his dish so much he wanted to return the following day for the same meal. BUT the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was sooooo refreshing!"}
{"text":"Ok first of all SUCH a cool place!! My boyfriend and I spent a week in Toronto last  month and happened to walk past and ultimately into The Senator looking for a breakfast place before going to one of the museums. I am so glad we went in! LOVED the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. It was small but in a cozy way not a cramped way. Their story is super cool and makes you love the place even more. I ordered the French toast and loved it! They serve it with syrup and raspberry jam and I was so mad I waited til halfway through my breakfast to try it with the jam. It was so good!  French toast will never be the same! Haha. If I'm ever back in the area I will definitely make a point to stop in!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once but I remember it being a positive experience. It's a little hard to find from the subway station though."}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve the current rating it has. The food it just okay, and it's pretty expensive compared to the competition. George Street Diner is much better, and cheaper too."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a friend on Sunday morning. Place was full but service was great, everyone was very nice and service was fast. Food is a bit pricy for breakfast and the coffee was $3.25, but well worth. We both got the eggs Benedict and the biscuit was excellent. This place is a gem right by ryerson! Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Awesome little place to eat. Excellent service and reasonable prices. No wonder there was a line out the door for Sunday brunch. Love the throwback atmosphere with a modern twist. If in Toronto again, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Sunday, and the bottom dining area of The Senator was packed, but the lounge (upstairs) had lots of space. The lounge has a different brunch menu than the restaurant (more French-inspired) and also had a more European/French feel that my friends and I really enjoyed. The lounge brunch was fantastic and the staff were so phenomenal and so nice that I would love to come back!
One of my friends had the \"Tempered Room\" Croissant Sandwich as is, and another had it with no meat/cheese and they were so nice that they put portobello mushrooms inside the one without meat (they both looked delicious and received rave reviews)! Myself and another friend had Le Continental and it was so good! Finally, another one of my friends ordered the Croque Forestiere, it did not come out with the rest of our meals, as there had been some sort of issue in the kitchen, but the staff were so fantastic that they brought out a salad for her while she waited for her sandwich (which still came with the side salad when it arrived), gave her a discount on her meal, and gave her a voucher for a baked good from the case in the main dining area downstairs! 
Honestly, it was one of the best brunch experiences I have ever had!

{"text":"We visited on a Friday evening around 6:00pm.  Although, the small, cozy, 50's style diner was busy, we were able to get the last table. The shallow, straight-backed, booth seating, linoleum tiled floor, welcoming staff and informal air about the place is palatable, although it could have been the baked pies that were on display behind us.

They have a couple beers on tap, a handful of wines and a list of interesting, old-time (but pricey) cocktails. 

We opted to dive straight into our meal and ordered the Flat Iron Steak with Blue Cheese Whipped Potatoes Red Wine Jus and Tobacco Onion Rings ($24), and the Smoked Chicken Cob Salad ($20).

Although the food took some time to arrive, we were not in a rush. When it did though my first thought was \"were are the onion rings?\". There was a medium sized steak (~8oz), mashed potatoes, and some mixed vegetables. Maybe its coming I thought, but after a couple minutes without being able to make eye contact with a server, I started eating.  The steak was OK, the potatoes were silky smooth with a hint of blue cheese, and the vegetables were excellent (even the cauliflower was cooked but still firm).  After looking at the menu again I could only surmise that the Tobacco Onion Rings must have been the small pile of crumbled deep fried batter that topped my steak. At this point the steak was done and I was too embarrassed to ask about it.  My partner's Cob Salad was excellent. The chicken was smoked to perfection and juicy, with a colorful mix of vegetables, sliced boiled egg and bacon.

Overall, a middling experience for the price (my partner would disagree).
Would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"'The Senator' diner, is a true Toronto landmark. It gets 4 stars for simply being one of the oldest and most charming establishments that is still holding its own and is able to produce good food and provide good service as well. 
We ordered the classic Eggs Benedict and the rebel Huevos Rancheros. In hindsight, I should have known better than to order Heuvos Rancheros at the Senator. I can't put my finger on the reason, but something tells me that the match was not made in heaven.
Overall food was decent. Pretty good quality for a diner. But expected better from \"Senator\". Quite a few decent bakeries and diners in Toronto, are able to churn out much better versions of there dishes.
The Eggs Benedict came with peameal bacon, and home fries. Potatoes were herbed and probably the star of the dish. The hollandaise was barely nappering, and not as rich and flavourful as it should be. Eggs were poached to perfection, but the English Muffin was quite rubbery. Overall it was a decent dish.
The Heuvos Rancheros came with homemade corn bread, which was quite simply one of the best cornbreads that I've ever had. I ordered my eggs overeasy and they were perfectly done. The rest of the dish was quite forgettable though. The salsa, I wish it would have been out of a jar.....because then it would have had some taste. The beans were simple from a can. I was excited to order this dish because the menu said it came with Chorizo sausage, which I absolutlely love because of its robust and strong flavour. The chorizo that actually came with the dish, was like a celebrity impersonator. Not sure why, may be its a type of chorizo that I'm not aware of. But it's flavour was probable 30% of a good Spanish Chorizo sausage.

Overall, its worth visiting again.The food might not be outstanding, but its not bad either. The staff is great, our server was very polite and friendly. And the coffee was good and strong....so can't complain."}
{"text":"I've heard such amazing things about this place and even saw it on You Gotta Eat Here. Coming in, I had such high expectations for an amazing diner experience with hardy food and good service. But I left a bit disappointed. We had the male server who was a bit rude. It seemed like he really hated his job. The other servers seemed very friendly so I think I just got the crap server. 
I ordered the mac and cheese and substituted the salad with fries. To substitute, it cost an extra $2. Disappointing. The food came in a timely manner and it was all good but not add great as I was expecting. The Mac and cheese was warm, not hot and it was as gooey and creamy as I was hoping for. They also used long noodles, which I thought didn't hold the cheese as well as other pasta. The fries were a total disappointment. The were soft and limp. Can't believe I paid and extra $2 for that. 
Honestly, I'm bummed. I really thought I was going to love the experience and cross another amazing place of my food bucket list. I really wanted to like this but I just found it as another old-school diner. I do want to come again to give it another shot but I don't know if the pricey food is worth it."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were okay, friendly service, great coffee! Recommend making an appointment ahead. Want to try their brunch next time!"}
{"text":"An old-school diner never goes out of style - 
\"With all the indie places and trendy cafes on every corner, there is a still a tasty piece of history waiting for you right in the heart of Toronto.\"
Just a bite from our full review.."}
{"text":"An all Canadian diner! Was intrigued to visit after seeing this om Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here!\". Great staff, amazing coffee and lots of cool Coca-cola memorabilia.

{"text":"Toronto's oldest restaurant is keeping it fresh! New menu items from a classically trained chef (Andrew Taylor comes from Langdon Hall), inventive new cocktail list and the same great brunch that's been keeping these guys afloat for generations. 

Love the throwback ambiance and the friendly service. 

Highly recommend the Cumbrae's beef burger and one of their boozy milkshakes!

{"text":"I came here early in the morning on the heels of a blizzard, cold and starving. I found a warm, welcoming, retro style diner, with friendly service.

I had the smoked salmon omelette and it more than sufficed. The homemade jam with challah toast, was, for me, the highlight. Wish I had time to try one of the homemade pastries but my friend had to get to work.

It's a neat, historical place in a busy area of town. A quiet, early morning getaway amid skyscrapers and bustling offices. Nancy Sinatra crooning Sugar Town in the background took my mind off so many other breakfast places being inexplicably closed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick greasy spoon in the morning."}
{"text":"The brunch there is really good. Very diverse and healthy. It was really lined up tho, but was worth of it. The space is really limited but the decoration's really cool."}
{"text":"I felt like I stepped onto a set from my favorite period drama series, \"Mad Men,\" when I walked into The Senator.  The booths, decor, and even the cash register in the front still has the 1950s feel to it.  This restaurant has been here since 1948 and everything is still in great condition.  We dined here for breakfast early in the morning and were sat right away.

Simple menu, excellent service, and quick turnaround for the food.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my boyfriend ordered the farmer's omelet.  It was a little pricey for breakfast, but the quality was fresh and everything was well prepared.

The Senator is an awesome spot to keep in mind for breakfast, especially since it's right in the Dundas-Yonge Square area."}
{"text":"Has quickly become my favorite place in town.. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I can always find something on the menu that I fall in love with.."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto Canada, we found this breakfast spot and came here everyday! There breakfast was so healthy, fresh, homemade, and family owned. I had the egg white veggie omelet that was so fresh.
They cracked each eggs and separated the whites.
There coffee is super fresh and delicious and there Oatmeal chocolate cookies are wholesome and homemade as well!!
Great staff! Great place to visit."}
{"text":"My bf took me here for breakfast a few weeks ago and I loved it! The Senator has managed to maintain an old-school diner feel, much like what you might find in New York. Very cute! They even have menus posted from way back when everything cost mere cents! The booths are a little crowded, but service is quick and attentive. We had to wait for our booth, but I was happy we did. 

We both ordered the House Smoked Salmon Omelette with Brie and Fresh Herbs. It was delicious and came with a homemade chili sauce, which although not spicy, was a very interesting and welcoming touch to our plates.

I'd like to come back again, but would be happy if the wait time was a little shorter. It is well worth it though!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with my pals today. 

It's a cute, old-school diner that serves your classic diner dishes. I have this bad habit of checking out menus online before going to a restaurant; a lot of my friends tell me that this ruins the whole experience of dining at a new place. Anyway, I was set on having their mac and cheese (I don't like Kraft Dinner and I'm too lazy to make m'n'c at home) after looking at the menu a few times. 

There are S P E C I A L S (I didn't know!) so I decided to try the P U M P K I N // P A N C A K E S. It was delish. I also want to add that their house brew coffee is awesome.

Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot. Great food quality, service, and atmosphere. If you are looking for an old school diner feel, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch and for dinner before. Today, I came here for brunch with D and another one of our friends. I really like this place. This place has a lot of history and it is a very cute little diner. You get a very homey and welcoming feeling. The seating is a bit tight but it is nice and clean. The only thing I don't like is the washrooms, which is located in the basement and a bit too dingy for me (I tend to feel very uncomfortable in washrooms that are not immaculately clean...)

Today, I ordered the Real Good Plate. It has all the fixings of a hardy breakfast - eggs, bacon, potatoes, pancake, beans, and toast. I have to say, it definitely hit the right spot on this long weekend. The portions were very big, I wasn't really able to finish my food. D had to finish my plate for me.... 

I find they have a very good menu for brunch and for dinner. I especially like how it is diner food, but it is not greasy. Although it is comfort food, I don't feel bad or guilty afterwards (well I don't feel too guilty *wink*). Honestly, I've been to other diners and I have to say this would be one of my go to's. Why? Well as I've mention above, I really enjoy the ambiance, the food is good and not greasy, and it is clean - the established feels like it is being really looked after."}
{"text":"intro
If you live in Toronto, you probably have at least one restaurant on your \"list\" that for one reason or another, you just have never been to despite good intentions.  I think The Senator was that place for me but I finally met a date there late night for dinner.

So yes--the Senator is one of those classic diners but not quite a greasy spoon if you are being specific.  A glance at the dinner menu quickly reports that their fare, post lunch, is a step up from what you'll find at a typical diner.  No meatloaf here.

drinks
We began with drinks.  I just had a Downtown Brown (Amsterdam) and she had a Dark and Stormy.  She reported that it was good and strong (lots of ginger)

apps
We both went for the fixed price so it was the beet salad for her and the Caesar for me.  It was certainly homemade.  Not very garlicky and you could really taste the fish and egg which was nice.  Portion size was spot on.

main
I went with the duck, mashed potatoes and veges.  It was all really tasty and pretty much exactly what I wanted.  The veges even included fiddle heads which was a nice touch.  My date liked the fish and chips.

desert
For our sweets, we went with the chocolate cake and sticky toffee pudding.  Their dessert menu is outsources but they have chosen well with the supplier.  The cake was fair (I'm probably not the best judge of chocolate cakes) but the pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist and sweet and spongy.  One is enough for two or even three to share.

atmosphere
We began at 7:15 and almost had the place to ourselves until leaving before 9:30.  This was great for conversation.  The place has a nice feel to it--kind of warm.  I'm sure this is a great spot to be in the dead of winter, especially for brunch.

service
Service was terrific.

price
The value is certainly fair given that you are getting great quality.  Two drinks and the two meals, all in with tax, was just under one hundred.  

conclusion
I really liked it here and would like to come back albeit for brunch.  This place would work well, for any meal, if you are on a date (first or otherwise) or with some friends.  I would not see how it works for parties of more than 4."}
{"text":"So I finally had a chance to have breakfast at the much talked about Senator.
Having not eaten since last night,I was hungry.
Let's start with the coffee.
No coffee taste at all!! Horrible.
I just had bacon and eggs etc.
Fried eggs over easy(looked like they were stepped on.
Toast was not even toasted,bacon hard and greasy.
Only the home fries were good.
10$ !
Absolute shit!
Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Ok place. Been here for a long time. Service and prices are average. So is the food. Nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Dont eat here! This place is way overrated. Canned mushrooms and bland food."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. The quality of the food was good and service friendly, though we would have appreciated bigger portion cos one of us ended up having to chow down a cheeseburger at Burger King nearby after. 

For the 3 of us, we shared the

1) sea scallop on a buckwheat crepe in tarragon crème sauce (came with asparagus), 
2) PEI mussels in white wine and crème fraiche (sour cream) and fries, and
3) crab cakes with guacamole and tartar sauce - it came with 2 crab cakes, so we ordered an extra crab cake for $5

The VFM item was their PEI mussels with fries; portion was the largest out of the 3 items we got. The sauce was delish and the mussels quite fresh. We saw not a few tables ordering this dish.  

Overall, this restaurant is a good option before watching a Mirvish show right across. And they do honour the 15% off if you check in on yelp."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Salmon omelette was dry. Service is horrible and without a smile. Blahhh"}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday late morning and tables were about 3/4 filled.
I ordered their open face omelette which was mediocre and the home fries were too oily. This place is good for a one time visit to experience eating in an old school diner. The price for the senator omelette is also on a high side."}
{"text":"food is relatively bland but not bad. atmosphere is very nice and there is a lot of history to the place so it's interesting. lots of lgbt staff!!"}
{"text":"No complaints. I've tried almost everything on the menu (it only took 3 years!) and haven't had a slip up yet. The service is fast even when there's a lineup, and when I'm sitting during a lineup I never feel rushed out of my seat even though I often come alone and hang take my time eating."}
{"text":"Fabulous little diamond to visit, they have great quality ingredients and their blueberry pancakes are awesome. Everything they make, has a special touch added to it that makes it better. I will be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"Th Senator is fantastic. Classic Toronto. Great atmosphere and service. I've seen lots of great reviews about the brunch (agreed) so I'll add a review specifically about the mac n' cheese. I was a little skeptical when it was served but WOW. It was delicious. Much more flavourful than I expected, creamy, a nice crunchy topping, and plentiful. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cute place to have brunch. I've heard so much about this place but the experience was really not all that. My egg Benedict was quite mediocre. Meh"}
{"text":"Finally had lunch at the venerable toronto diner. After a reasonable wait time for a booth we ate burgers, club sandwiches, salads and remarkably good French toast. The atmosphere, staff and good food were totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after seeing so many positive reviews on Yelp.

I showed up without making a reservation so I was offered the window table or the bar stool area.  I took the window table as it was still shielded from the front door. I guess since it was in the midst of a mild snowfall, I didn't need to line up so I was lucky in that regard.

I read that this was the oldest restaurant in the area and you certainly get that feeling when you are there but in a \"character\" sort of way... especially when you look at the seating, decor, and other elements of the past.

I ordered the chipotle ribs as a appetizer and the steak frites as the main course.

Service was both friendly and prompt.

The ribs weren't the best I had but did well as an appetizer.

The Steak Frites were the hilight for me. I think it ranks in my top three in the GTA for steaks. The price is very reasonable too! Cheaper than going to a place like The Keg and I liked this steak better.

I heard that brunch is really good here so regardless if it's brunch, lunch or dinner, I will be back.

The area is known for cookie-cutter franchise restaurants like Jack Astors, Hard Rock Cafe, and probably a Boston Pizza or Pickle Barrel are nearby too.  I choose this place any day and I'd recommend that you do too!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for breakfast. Great food and service. Has a feel of an old diner. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Not a fan.  I went for dinner based on several reviews here.  The place was not busy, but I still ended up at the counter.  Service was disappointingly unattentive.  I ordered the meatloaf and was singularly unimpressed.  Not bad, just not tasty.  People rave about breakfast.  I was disappointed enough to not be interested in going back to find out."}
{"text":"Just around the corner from the Yonge/Dundas madness, The Senator feels like a step back in time. The retro booths, vinyl seatbacks, friendly service, and vintage cash registers feel like a 1940's film. We stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday morning, finding the place fairly quiet and only about a quarter full. We sat in a booth near the back with a mix of locals and tourists alike.  The breakfast menu is an expansive variety of traditional Canadian breakfast and deli fare. Our waitress was friendly and was prompt with our orders and lots of hot coffee.

I had a hard time deciding on what to order when our waitress mentioned that they were featuring fresh Ontario Peach Pancakes. I didn't need to be told twice. The pancakes came out piping hot with enormous peach slices baked right inside and a nice dollop of fruit compote and butter. I didn't even touch the maple syrup, the pancakes were superb without. Since I was already having a carb affair, I threw in an order of buttery Challah toast. My carb craze was complete and I was happy.

We checked out our check with another friendly waitress who chatted up with us. We loved everything about The Senator and thought about coming back on our trip for more. Unfortunately, we didn't get around to it but I'll be sure to return on my next visit to Toronto. I think I hear those Ontario Peaches calling my name now!"}
{"text":"I think the key to having a good brunch at this place is to sit in the downstairs section rather than the upstairs. We arrived during a busy part of the morning and opted to sit upstairs because of the shorter wait time. It's small and quiet up there. The tables were REALLY close together -- got to know some fellow travelers at the table next to us. The upstairs menu is quite limited. They got my husband's order wrong initially. He had the \"upstairs breakfast\" which was alright and I had the croissant sandwich (smoked salmon, cream cheese, pickled onions and a side salad) which was decent. The servers were very nice but they didn't offer my husband the coffee/tea that was supposed to come with the upstairs breakfast. The couple next to us decided it would have been better to wait for a downstairs table and I would have to agree."}
{"text":"Location and setting is 5*****.  Food is 4****.  Think cozy booths and basic breakfast fair. Service is smooth. Great 'feel' while dining in the booths."}
{"text":"We came Saturday 11:30am for brunch before catching a musical at Ed Mirvish. We were seated after a 15 minute wait. 

The diner has a very classic old-fashioned feel to it, it's apparently the oldest restaurant in Toronto. 

I couldn't decide what to get so went with the  Real Good Plate - eggs, challah toast, home fries, maple baked beans and a made-from-scratch pancake. 

I haven't had maple baked beans before, guess I didn't realize there would be an odd sweetness to them, so I didn't like them but I can't blame the Senator for that. The toast, eggs and fries were average. The beans were touching the pancake which meant part of the pancake got the taste of the beans, not sure why they arrange the plate like that. 

The pancake with maple syrup was amazing, very moist. I may return next time I go to Ed Mirvish and if I do, it will be for pancakes."}
{"text":"Definitely the cherry on top of my east coast trip! My husband and I love love love breakfast, we usually try and hit up a good brunch place whenever we can. Being our last day in Toronto, I found this place on Yelp and read a bunch of good reviews. Their service was impeccable! People were lined up very neatly, seated quickly, treated very efficiently and we were fed AHHHHMAZING FOOD! if you're in the area, you should definitely check this place out! I got the waffles, YUM! with a side of butter, and a little maple syrup........ golden."}
{"text":"Amazing greasy spoon. Great food, desserts, drinks and service. Good menu, something for everyone. Great before and after for theatre and TIFF"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place or more importantly, his parents love this place which makes me want to also love this place.

Alas, I do not. We went for brunch (because brunch is supposedly awesome) and it fell short.

This place reminds me a lot of The Lakeview with the decor and the set up and the menus. Mediocre food and borderline service. 

I think it was the owner who served us and she seemed to be trying to get people in and out and forgot about offering the tea that was supposed to come with my meal. When I asked for it, she was kinda cranky and said nothing about it and plopped it on the table afterwards. I'm glad I asked for it because it was actually my favorite part of the meal.

The breakfast was nothing special, for the price that it was. The homefries that came with the plate tasted like potato pieces covered in ramen noodle packet seasoning. Yeah, you heard me. Ramen noodles.

 So if ramen packet potatoes are your thing, go ahead and check this place out...but if I were you? Save your money and go somewhere else for brunch."}
{"text":"Consistency counts for a lot and this place has it. Breakfast that never disappoints, like your most worn-in pair of jeans.

I don't deviate, No. 2 Senator Breakfast.

Bacon and eggs, Challah toast, beans and homefries with coffee. Before 11:30AM (I can roll out of bed at 11:15 and still make the cut)...it is only $7.95. Tasty and cheap...yessss. Add a glass of real fresh squeezed OJ and you're set for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. The attitude is not that good. I like the atmosphere of this restaurant. It is kinda of old fashion bar style ~"}
{"text":"Great food, decent service and big menu. Long line ups on the weekend for brunch but you can opt for the bar for faster service. The salmon Benedict and senator breakfasts are my go to dishes. Not too greasy if you opt for the salad. Their homemade hot sauce is super hot so beware."}
{"text":"Love the huevos rancheros, love the carrot cake, love the coffee, love the milkshakes  and LOVE the service, I go whenever I'm close by and always get the same, I've tried other items in the menu but the huevos rancheros are the best."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, nothing too special though. VERY expensive for breakfast. Service was a little slow but the meal was satisfying."}
{"text":"Nice little diner located in downtown core! This place is quite popular and well-known, so be prepared to line up especially in the morning for breakfast. 

I can't say enough about their breakfast menu!! It is hard to impress with traditional breakfast item (eggs, house fries, bacon strips, baked beans, toasts etc.) BUT they do it here! I got Senator breakfast (coffee or tea included). They freshly make bread. It is fluffy and light! They serve farm eggs (the yolk is very dark in color). Their coffee is good too! Potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Basically, every item on that plate was made to perfection with fresh ingredients! 

Because I was so impressed with their breakfast, I came back to try different dish for lunch. I got turkey club. It was good but turkey meats were too dry. Although it wasn't as good as breakfast I had here,  it was still solid. 

Overall, good ambience, friendly and quick service, excellent breakfast, and convenient location!! I would recommend this place to anyone. Go try their toasts!!"}
{"text":"First let me say, the people that work here are sooooo nice! And they are very good looking. Not like supermodel, but like normal very human good looking and you want to hang around with them for the afternoon. Like they are friends of the people on \"Friends\"
Anyway...
The food is very good. Perfect latte
Didn't know what to order it all looked good so I got the Senator and was not disappointed. Get the challah bread. Yum. 
I might come back for the bacon alone. Mmmm
Next time gotta try pancakes. The guy next to me is wolfing his down and the girl he's with keeps eating it off his plate, looks  like there might have a fight over them..."}
{"text":"This place isn't retro, it is original. A menu full of comfort food. Our group had meatloaf, the liver & braised short ribs. All very good , short ribs were tender & delicious  with nice veg. Sticky toffee pudding was delicious--not too sweet 
They mix a good martini & wine by glass
Was quite drinkable. Our server was helpful, friendly and efficient. A beautifully preserved 1940s room serving good food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere,  fun staff, decent food.  Had the steak,  was a little thin, but good flavor.  I would tecommend, especially if going to a show across the street."}
{"text":"Yelp helped me to find this restaurant near my hotel during a visit to Toronto. I loved the decor and set up of this restaurant. It has an old school diner vibe, with burgundy, leather covered seats in the booths and old coca cola signs on the walls. 
The Senator prides itself on serving food made with real ingredients, free from MSG and preservatives- always a great place to start! It had a good selection of options for breakfast ranging from steel cut oats to eggs Benedict. I enjoyed a pretty classic breakfast of scrambled eggs served with breakfast sausage, potatoes, baked beans and a Montreal style bagel. It was all delicious but I asked for the sausage to be well done and it wasn't.
My only main complaint was the service. We got passed from server to server and they all seemed to be too busy (even though the restaurant wasn't full at all). It's always nice when a server takes the time to ask if you need anything else.
I would definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"My favourite diner in Toronto. Predictable menu but quality is better than most. Also, the service is reliable."}
{"text":"Très bon service, la serveuse parlait même français et était très sympathique!

On se sent dans un restaurant des années '50, très agréable comme endroit, et le foie de veau était comme dans mes souvenirs des repas de ma mère (avec bacon et oignons)."}
{"text":"I went to the Senator on a Saturday for brunch. We were seated upstairs - a relatively recent development to the restaurant. Additional seating is definitely welcome since it can get quite packed on the weekends.

I got the \"Real Good Plate\" which is the standard English breakfast of bacon, home-fries and scrambled eggs. I've heard very good things about the Eggs Benedict and the Croque Monsieur, so I'd give those dishes a try if you're not boring like me with breakfast food. For what's considered a \"diner\", it's pretty excellent.

I'm a big fan of the Senator and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"The food has generous size and great taste! I ordered the senator burger, and boy was it huge for me. It's 9.95 without extra toppings. My friend got fish and chips. The fried fish had this nice layer of crunchiness and soft interior. Overall we see satisfied with the dining experience. 

The restaurant itself is very classy. The seats are a bit small because the whole restaurant is very narrow and long. The servers are very friendly and efficient too. 

I would love to visit this place again."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast since it's seemingly one of the few hip places we could find open in the area at 7:30am on a Saturday morning! 

I had the senator's breakfast which was pretty basic but for some reason the challah toast with homemade jam was a real winner. I don't know what it was about that toast but I finished all of mine and didn't bother much with the beans.

My friends ordered the Benedict and they seemed happy with their choice. We all ordered lattes and they were large and delicious. Overall -- a solid breakfast choice in downtown Toronto but not worth more than a 30 minute wait. 

It's very old school 1970s diner style with little booths and I could see it getting crowded during peak hours. But if you come as early as opening time, you'll be sure to get friendly service and a seat quickly!"}
{"text":"I was here on a couple of occasions - the first was a very good experience, the second was not a very good experience so I guess overall this place was a bit average.  The food was good for the most part - we were here for breakfast/brunch and had a couple of the egg dishes, which were good...we also shared some french toast, which was pretty good too.  The second experience was bad mostly because of a horrible server who was pretty rude throughout the experience (he rolled his eyes at us on several occasions) and never checked on us during our meal.  While I usually don't complain about bad service, this was pretty hard to ignore.     

I still think this is a good breakfast/brunch option, I'd just make sure I don't get that same server again.  On a side note, our first server and the person at the register were friendly and made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"A place where time seems to stand still, the Senator might as well consider itself a diner landmark in Toronto.  It's not your usual chain of diners such as Johnny Rockets, or Frans, but rather The Senator has the ability to retain its exclusive clients that keep coming back here for more.  The staff are easy going, awesome, and are always there to cater to your requests.  The environment resembles like your typical diner, old wooden swindle chairs along the counter, old COKE machine, napkin dispensers, dim ceiling lights, and flooring.  
The menu has its options: with a breakdown costs or apps, mains, dessers, or a fixed price which includes all three, approx $34

I ended up having their 8oz burger with swiss cheese, and handcut fries.  Lets just say they cooked it to my preference, medium (for burgers) . Juicy, tender, just stick-to-your-ribs type of thang :)  The fries were not oily, but rather tender and not over-salted like McDonalds :) 

My buddy (recent ELITE) Jacob had their short ribs, on a bed of mash, and he said this dish made the CUT in his GOOD BOOKS....i assume a positive review will be coming up on his part lol!! 

The senator has always been, and will always be a one of a kind place in Toronto.  The fact that it's right beside the JAZZ bistro, theatres, massey hall, and they have a late night menu is A PLUS!!!! il be back!"}
{"text":"We had the senator breakfast and eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. Both really lovely. What amazing history!! My husband had a buttermilk pancake on the side and said best pancake he's ever had!!"}
{"text":"My table had two burgers during the morning rush hour. I felt like the burgers themselves were a tad too undercooked, as it was so bloody. It also wasn't that great a patty too and it paled in comparison to even the fast food burger establishment's. But the entire restaurant itself was...old, but wasn't entirely cleaned properly, as i could see some crumbs fall between the cushions. The prices for the food was also exceptionally really high (21$ for a burger and fries at a diner?). I would give this place another chance as I see the establishment as a specialized breakfast/brunch and rating them on a burger meal isn't exactly fair. 

Service: 4/5
Food: 3/5

{"text":"Check-in here and you will receive a 15% coupon for the meal.

I arrived in a group of 4 on a Thursday night at 8 pm. The narrow diner was full, but we were quickly seated as it was a bit past dinner time. Dinner prices are fair for the portion size (ranging from approximately $16 to $23).

I ordered meat loaf and mash potatoes. It came with a side of green beans, broccoli and brussel sprouts. The meat was tender and the gravy was on the lighter side, perfectly complementing the plate."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp! A group of us were looking for a good place for breakfast, and Yelp led us there. 

This was a great place, and I liked the local atmosphere. The food was great. I had the Senator Breakfast. My colleagues were also very satisfied. Warning, though. The house made hot sauce is made with scotch bonnet. A little goes a long way."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from The Senator so I've been here on several occasions. The atmosphere and the food quality are both very good, however, I went today as I am moving away from the area and I thought I'd go one last time before moving but was surprised by the hike in the prices of their menu. The same classic eggs Benedict that used to be $14 is now $20, without any change in portion size or quality. The Senator breakfast (I think is what it's called) is basically 2 eggs, 3 pieces of bacon, some baked beans, 2 slices of toasted bread with butter, some home fries, and a slice of orange was $18. The saving grace is that it does come with coffee or tea (but only this menu item, other options I do not believe comes with coffee or tea). So for a very basic breakfast that you can probably make at home is going to cost you about $22 after tax and tip... Which is frankly a bit overpriced. 
I can't really think of another brunch/breakfast place that would charge this amount. 
That said, the food is still delicious as always, the bread is super soft and yummy, the home made fruit preserves is excellent, not too sweet, the service is great, but I still can't justify spending that much money on a simple breakfast... It's still super popular though, a line of people waiting is often seen particularly during brunch."}
{"text":"Tourist vibe, at least based on prices it has to be considered as such..
The vintage interior is very appealing, although I felt I was a part of the loud ladies enitre conversation in the booth 2 feet away.  I liked the various booths, it's quite narrow inside, so they did their best to maximize space.
The carmelized pancakes were good, 3 is too much, 2 is a good amount.  At about 15 bucks, seems a lot for pancakes, nice touch having 'real' syrup.  Coffees are excellent.
I'd give 3.5 stars, can't so 3 it is; based solely on inflated prices.  At 15 bucks for pancakes you come once to try it, not likely a return visit.  Bathrooms could use a revamp (if possible/space?)."}
{"text":"Cool, classic diner vibe. I love that they use fresh, local and quality ingredients.

I came for breakfast and had the Senator's breakfast which came with bacon, eggs (any style), Challah toast, maple baked beans, home fries, and coffee or tea. I really enjoyed the Challah toast which was fresh and delicious with the homemade jam. The maple baked beans were sweet and tasted like yummy pumpkin pie. I think it was the seasoning. 

Service was courteous but a bit slow and spotty. 

It seems that the restaurant turns into a bar, Bar Senator, on the weekends which seems worth checking out."}
{"text":"I could arm wrestle Zeus after this breakfast.

Well, I proved that I could at least walk 20 min in -16  through Toronto.

Great cappuccino. Delicious eggs, pea bacon and challah toast.

Challah!"}
{"text":"great meal here tonight. the macaroni and cheese appetizer was excellent. had the muscovy duck for my main which was slightly overcooked for my taste. medium instead of medium-rare. that is the only reason they didn't get five stars but it was still a delicious meal. I will definitely make the senator a regular stop next visit to toronto."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! You get what you pay for.
I had steak & eggs and cappuccino. Steak was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing,  eggs were good as well. 
Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This is a proper downtown diner a la Nighthawks.  Grab a booth, or saddle up to the bar, have a coffee, and read the paper.  The menu is just what you would expect from a diner: comfort food.  Quality is always consistant, the oil is always clean, and your meal is made to order.  On top of that, the service is fast and courteous.  Make sure you grab dessert (even if you are there for breakfast), its worth the extra time at the gym."}
{"text":"Wow. Best breakfast in months if not years.  Start with the coffee - dark, rich flavor, not bitter or acidic. It's worth the trip by itself. Other diners should take note.  I ordered the \"Real Good Plate\" - two eggs, pancake, peameal bacon, beans , home fries and two slices of thick challah toast. The buttermilk pancake with warm, real maple syrup was tasty and light. The bacon had great flavor and the maple baked beans were sweet without being syrupy.  Accompany the whole thing   with a spicy Bloody Caesar....my day is only downhill from here.  Worth the wait at the door."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch today and the place was packed. I'd give 3 for food and service and 2 for location and ambiance as the place is quite tiny and the number of tables are more than the place's capacity. Overall, it is ok but nothing great!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast around 9 on a Sunday morning. It wasn't too busy yet and my friend and I got a table immediately.

They have an extensive brunch and breakfast menu with pretty well anything you could want.

I ordered the fruit bowl ($8). It is a decent sized dish that came with bananas, cantaloupe, grapes, berries (all types), kiwi, mango, and pineapple. Some of the pieces of pineapple had brown spots on them which didn't look too appetizer; however, all of the other fruit were fresh. I would order this dish again, although I think $8 is a bit steep - $6 would be more reasonable.

My friend ordered a standard two egg breakfast ($7.95) that came with home fries, bakes beans, and toast. They have dark rye bread! I love it when diners offer rye toast! He enjoyed his dish and thought it was pretty standard fare.

We had unlimited coffee and tea ($2.75 each), but I had to keep asking for refills of my pot of tea because they serve it in a tiny pot!

The environment is relaxed and casual. It looks like a diner from the 20s-40s, but it's clean and well maintained.

Service was fast and efficient and our food and drinks arrived quickly. Our server was very friendly, but it would have been helpful for her to tell us to take our cheque to the front to pay. 

I would definitely return for breakfast / brunch again or to try lunch or dinner there. I also like that they accept AMEX."}
{"text":"I'm a new fan... the service was friendly.
The braised beef was so tender, instead of cutting it i simply tore at it with my fork... 
The hamburger was surprisingly delicious... surprisingly, since i was expecting a normal burger experience.  I'm actually looking forward to returning and having one with cheese... i only had a few bites from my girlfriend's cheese-less burger :( ... the sautéed onions, tomato and mustard were a perfect fit..."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the city, the senator is a mixture of hippie and modern diner. Decorations elude it's history dating back for over a century which the menu narrates. The food, was pretty good depending on what was plated. Pricing was a bit high but I'm assuming that comes with the location. Glad we got the gentleman as our waiter because the young waitress was just in a crappy mood or she just felt like giving dirty looks and being rude (that lost them a star). Overall nice ambience, hip local diner with pricey decent food."}
{"text":"I love checking out old restaurants and bars that retain a lot of history, and The Senator did not disappoint. As a lover of this sort of nostalgia, stopping there was one of the highlights of my trip to Toronto.
We sat at the counter and our server was a man of few words who took pretty good care of us. When in Rome...we both decided to order the Senator breakfast. Baked beans for breakfast?? Sure, it's a little unusual, but the meal was good, and chased with a hearty mug with The Senator logo on it filled with stout coffee from a local supplier, Dark City Coffee, it hit the spot.
On the wall were framed copies of old menus, and while some, if not all of the light fixtures have probably been replaced, the space retains the beauty of a bygone era with it's vintage counter seating, wood back bar area and booths complete with hat/coat racks attached."}
{"text":"The senator is an amazing restaurant right by Yonge-Dundas square! It's very busy. I stopped in for dinner rather early (around 4:30) and had was told we could only be there an hour because the restaurant was fully booked in the evening. I think there was a show at the Ed mirvish so that's not surprising. All of the food was amazing!! The staff was kind and very friendly. He prom chop is delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to the Senator twice, once for brunch and once for dinner. It's a really nice restaurant. The place is apparently a million years old, but manages to look like something out of the 50s without actually looking old and worn out. I quite like the restaurant space. It's filled with booth after booth. Who doesn't like sitting in a booth? The food is really good, and priced reasonably. Burgers are definitely worth getting, though the fries were a bit meh. Brunch is typical dinner fare, and didn't disappoint. This place is one of the better restaurants in the sea of shitty places to eat that is Yonge and Dundas."}
{"text":"I've had better brunch. The toast is great and their jam is quite special. 
Mocha is to die for. 

But, one of our egg benedict came out cold. 
The flavor was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with interesting seating (you'll see what I mean when you go!)

I have wanted to try this staple of Toronto for years.  I came for lunch and had the Greek salad.  It was big and fresh, and the dressing was definitely home made.  I liked how it came in a little jar so you could pour as much or as little as you wanted.  I wish they sold the dressing because it was to die for.

I really need to try breakfast here one time, and will certainly come back to do so.  When I have come in the past the line has been incredibly long (out the door), so get there early!

My only qualm is that they only had the tiny classes for water - which I hate b/c I drink a lot of water with my meal.  The server wasn't as attentive as I had hoped and didn't fill it up often."}
{"text":"A hearty, delicious breakfast in a cozy, historic setting, what more can you want?    I forgot to mention the friendly staff and clientele.   A great way to celebrate Father's day."}
{"text":"Great old time diner vibe with gourmet comfort foods like meatloaf & calves liver.
I had the Bucatini pasta -really good!
Wines are reasonable too"}
{"text":"Made my second trip to The Senator on Sunday morning with some friends visiting from Connecticut. They wanted to eat a real Toronto breakfast and this was the place they wanted to experience. Inside this diner it looks untouched from it's original inception and it definitely adds to the appeal. I'll be honest, I did not love this place the first time I came here (It was several years ago and at this point, I don't even remember why I didn't enjoy it). We were seated immediately and our waitress was quick and helpful to get us our morning beverages and take our orders. I ordered some scrambled eggs with toast and peameal bacon and from the second it touched my mouth I was loving it. Every aspect of this breakfast was the exact thing you would want to eat in the morning and I left feeling charged, full, and the same can be said for the friends I was with. This trip definitely changed whatever experience I had in the past and I look forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"I work down the street so coming here for work was a no brainer. It boasts being one of the oldest restaurants in Toronto and it has a great feel. This is like stepping back in time and going to a 50's diner. 

I had a Grilled Cheese and Beef and Barley Soup and my friend had a BLT. The portions were a good size and the sandwiches were great. The grilled cheese had thick cut bread and a good amount of quality cheese. The BLT was loaded with peameal, thick cut tomatoes (my friends sandwich had almost an entire tomato on it) and was messy but delicious. The soup on the other hand wasn't the greatest, a little bland.

On the way out to pay they had pieces of a cookie to try. It was one of the best chocolate chip cookies I have tried in a while, loaded with chips and a hit of nutmeg. I would recommend grabbing one on your way out. 

Overall a cool little casual place with decent diner food and an interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great spot to go and an especially a good spot to take out of town visitors for lunch.
I have to go back again."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! The place itself is not the biggest and we waited about 15-20 minutes, but throughout the wait, the waitress kept checking back with us to make sure we're comfortable. 

Now, the food. First of all, their pancakes, amazing! (You can order them as a side). Their portion size is pretty good, so you are getting a bang for your buck. Their food also taste amazing, you can't really go wrong with anything that you order...

Love this place, great service, great good, and fairly priced! 

Will definitely be back to try more of their menu :)"}

Disclaimer: I'm not a big breakfast or brunch guy.

The experience at The Senator was less than impressive. I even forgot what I order but the content of the meal we're: four fried eyes, baked beans, potatoes, four pieces of toast, and bacon with tea. It ended being around 19+ CAD with tip. 

The taste of the meal was ok. I was hella hungry so it satisfied my hunger but didn't make me enjoy eating it. The space was kinda cramped and my friend and I shared a booth and had alot of space but it would have felt cramped if we had more people in our group. The service was not so friendly. There was not much explanation of the menu or recommendations.

I asked for one of the meals but it was crazy expensive. It would have been around 34 CAD without tax and tip. Way too much for this place. I believe the cost of my meal was a bit too much. 

Overall, I'm find going to like a Denny's or IHOP and spending less for the same quality of food."}
{"text":"What a shame! My last meal in Toronto (after being here for 10 days) I chose specifically to come back for a 5th time to The Senator.  The service was not the best, was told to choose my own seat whilst the handsome dude greeting me carried on stamping paper cups.  The person who approached the table where I sat, looked like a homeless guy from the street with the charisma of a baked bean.  The friendliest person by far was one if the pot wash guys, smiling and saying excuse me as he passed everyone, even wished a lady who he inadvertently tapped, 'a great day'... Hmmmm emotional intelligence apart, the management needs to rethink it's customer facing personnel... And thinking back, the last visit, the lady server was far from what you would expect from such a highly rated place.

SORRY Senator, you need to book up your ideas as your customer facing staff are letting you down, or your hiring process... Either way, its your call... Remember my money, and that of potential customers will spend just about anywhere!"}
{"text":"Founded in 1929 The Senator is one of the oldest establishments in the city.

It's a proper old school diner with good coffee and a large breakfast, lunch and dinner choice.

You can tell its good the moment you walk in. It's busy and there's a really good vibe about the place.

I had a cafe latte and it was good. I live in Melbourne where coffee is a high standard and this was the only place in Canada that I went that measured up.

Unfortunately I wasn't hungry but my friend tried the Eggs Benedict and he said it was really good. The portion was enormous too.

Service was great, despite it being so busy. The waitress was really attentive, friendly and chatty.

If you want a proper diner experience, definitely come here you will not be disappointed. I can't wait to return if I'm ever in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. I'm a sucker for eggs Benedict and had to get them here. My kids had pancakes and loved them. The Benedict sits atop a freshly  baked biscuit which was delicious.  The eggs were a bit overdone for what I like but all in all still very very good. If you like your poached eggs a little runny you might ask ahead for it when ordering to be sure.  Cool spot. All booths and a counter. Feels old school and delivers on deliciousness."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning about 30 min after opening and it had a good amount of people. Didn't have to wait which is great. Got the \"Senator Breakfast\" which seems like basic breakfast at most restaurants but with baked beans and also got the blueberry pancakes.

Overall, the food was decent. Nothing to write home about. Pancakes are good and fluffy. The Senator Breakfast though was a bit small (see photo) and home fries were a bit dry.

I might be back due to proximity and the weekday prices are cheaper."}
{"text":"Yelp, you were the reason for this visit. We wanted a good breakfast spot within walking distance of our hotel. We found a nice spot. A lot of history here in The Senator. 

I got the 'The Senator\" a delicious combo of eggs, bacon, toast and baked beans.

Friendly staff and a cute little place."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time this morning. It was almost at capacity when we walked in at 9 AM on a Saturday morning. I ordered the eggs benedict and my bf ordered the Senator breakfast. Our food arrived hot about 15 minutes later. We did not order drinks but coffee was included with his meal. Total order, tax and tip in, came to just over $50. Good quality and flavour but much too much to spend on a simple breakfast. Won't return for this reason alone."}
{"text":"Cant help but love this place. Diner food, with retro decor, how can you go wrong? The waiters are always friendly, and breakfast is always good. I've been coming here for a few years now, and other breakfast places just don't live up to it!

I don't often come here for dinner, but I have heard they have great burgers, and the turkey sandwich is my favourite non breakfast choice, with all of it's cranberry mayo goodness."}
{"text":"We went there for only a coffee and desert in the middle of the afternoon and felt very badly welcomed and very much undesired. Some tables against the wall are tiny and you have to sit side by side facing a small wall.  We felt punished in there, so we moved to another table. The deserts were OK but a little pricey. We won't go back, mainly because of the waiters."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday morning around 10, and there's already a line at the door. Wait was around 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad, but they made us sit/stand outside in the cold.

We were seated at the bar, and I ordered a coffee and the Huevos Racheros, a popular choice going by the other reviews here.

When comparing to pictures online, one thing I noticed when my food came was instead of avocado slices, I got some guacamole. Not sure if they changed it or if the avocados were starting to brown so they tried to hide it as guac. Otherwise food was alright, I quite liked the cornbread that came with it. Service was friendly and prompt.

Two meals + Two coffees + Tax&Tip ended up about $45."}
{"text":"If you're a tourist in Toronto, you have plenty of breakfast options. You may be tempted by Fran's, Cora, or some other hole in the wall. Reject them all an head to the Senator.

It is a legit old school diner, tucked away amongst the touristy things of Dundas Square. Had the Huervos Rancheros, my Dad had \"The Senator.\" Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Sweet, petite and just what I was looking for! Really good Eggs Benedict for breakfast, with the most golden eggs I've ever seen. The hollandaise was almost orange (but still tasty)! The potatoes were awesome as well, quality breakfast tea, and really good bacon. They even serve Coke in the old bottles, just like the vintage tin sign on the wall touts. Looked like they had a lot of fun desserts, and the inside of the place is so much fun! fyi- bathroom was downstairs, and tables are packed in the main space cleverly."}
{"text":"Pricey, unfriendly staff, crowded restaurant. However, the quality of the breakfast changed my perspective towards the place.  We had salmon benedicts and they were delicious.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and ingredients were fresh.  It was worth a visit."}
{"text":"My head tells me that The Senator is really a 4 star place, but since we stopped there thrice during our recent vacation, that has to say something, my heart tells me to go to the fifth star.

A few caveats - we dined exclusively during the week, when it was never really crowded - i'm assuming that quite a line develops with the weekend brunch crowd, especially considering it location right outside the square.

Everything we ordered, from the baked goods to the eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc., was delicious, seemed reasonably priced for the location, and came out quickly.  My one qualm is that my wife got the last banana nut muffin, and we came in the next day and they still had not replenished - i left Toronto still wanting to try that muffin!

Service was very friendly and accommodating - we felt very welcomed each time we ate there."}
{"text":"There are a lot of fancy-schmancy places where you can wait in line for forty five minutes to eat their brunch, but why do that when you can go to the Senator and have all of your favourite foods, unlimited refills on coffee and be served by awesome, funny servers?

i can't say enough good things about it. The Senator is a comfortable diner-style place where you can eat breakfast until 2, sit in booths and have great conversation. Also, they have HP sauce if you want sausages, which you do."}
{"text":"Kicking it old school, we went to The Senator for breakfast one morning during our stay in Toronto.

I had the blueberry pancakes with at side of sunny-side up eggs and bacon (I can put it away) and my other half had the Mushroom, Tomato and Swiss Cheese Omelet. Good stuff.

Why only 3 stars you ask? The service was a little suspect. It took FOUR REQUESTS to the waitress to get water for the table (The last time when I asked she said \"Order? I thought I took your order\".).

Also, my pancakes came out well before my sides, and as you can see by my photo, I like to put my eggs on top of my pancakes. And the place wasn't even that busy for 9:30am on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, small boothes. For was very good ordered the openface omelette with smoked salmon... Yum. It is one of the oldest restaurants in the city. Had to take some maple syrup to go. Small boothes and too close to other diners. But worth it because you see what everyone else is munching on lol"}
{"text":"Our first morning in Toronto we explored this based on it's great reviews!  We had the French toast and huevos rancheros.  Both were very good- the French toast sweet and crispy, but not too sweet.  The huevos rancheros came with chorizo that was just the right amount of spicy and the fresh salsa and avocado paired with everything nicely.  Definitely try the cornbread- it was really good too.

They have a lot of baked goods for sale in their case up front, we drooled a bit but didn't take anything to go because we were plenty full.  Service was friendly and fast too.  The place overall is small and narrow so I can see how it would get crowded, but we didn't feel rushed while we enjoyed our breakfast.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Senator, it's a classic, breakfast with beans!"}
{"text":"Place is right next to Eaton Centre,  east walking distance from mall and several hotels. Good prices, not too expensive. The wait staff is pleasant and on top of their game. Not a ton of room, so get there early. Food was good. We went for breakfast. I would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much straight-up what I would imagine your typical diner to be like. It opens early (even though pretty much everything else in the neighborhood outside of Tim Horton's is closed at this time), and the service is quick and speedy. And to boot, the food is above average as well. I had the French toast, which was the right thickness for challah bread (not too thick, but thick enough to absorb the syrup). The side of peameal bacon wasn't as delicious as it was at Carousel Bakery, but it was still miles better than versions of Canadian bacon I've had in the U.S. As a nice little plus, the orange juice here is truly fresh-squeezed - it's plenty pulpy and is a great way to start an early breakfast or brunch meal.

All in all, this was a nice spot near where we were staying to grab a bite before hitting the road. Service was lightning quick (we had our food probably 5 minutes after ordering), and it has a nice little old-time charm about it. I'd come back for breakfast if I was in the area."}
{"text":"My visit to the The Senator was a few years after watching an episode of \"You Gotta Eat Here\" on the Food Network. 

I had a Huevos Rancheros with eggs scrambled. The breakfast was good and as many have noted a bit expensive. As the breakfast is quality it is worth it. 

Coffee had a bit of a different taste. I tried a coffee in a Kitchener diner which has a similar taste.

Service was okay with a mixed level of friendliness. The main server seemed to be a in hurry to get off his shift. The server at the cash was more helpful."}
{"text":"On vacation, we found this restaurant on Yelp.
When we walked on, we weren't sure if we supposed to take a number or wait. We stood by the wall with another couple. I think we stood there about 20 minutes.

The restaurant has the look on of an old school restaurant. It isn't particularly bright. But the design is from the 30's Art-deco.

As we made our way to our seats, I saw a lot of small booths. Oh one more thing. The manager/ head waiter was a hoot. Lively guy. 

Considering how long we had to wait, the food came pretty quickly.
I had the meat loaf, which was good, not great. I enjoyed nevertheless.
My wife had the fish and chips.

All and all..it was a pleasant experience, which is what you want on Saturday date night,
 
M"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a while back.  Searching through the reviews, this place seemed to be great place for breakfast given its high 4/5 rating.  However, a huge disappointment as it was just typical diner food, nothing special, nothing unique.  

Decor and pricing was average, although I highly recommend the waiters for being so attentive and offering to take photos for us when he saw me pull out a camera for this review.

So either it's overrated, or we ordered food that was just so-so.  We ordered :

- Senator Breakfast ... Bacon & Eggs with Challah Toast, Beans, & Home Fries, Tea or Coffee
Before 11:30am  $7.95
After 11:30am  $9.95

- Huevos Rancheros with Black Beans, Tomato Salsa, Avocado & Homemade Corn Bread
$10.95


Looks and tastes like ordinary breakfast from other places.  Definitely doesn't compare to Lady Marmalade despite the same average rating on Yelp.  Photos of both uploaded."}
{"text":"I have been to my fair share of diners and this is truly a gem for Toronto! I could write a review extolling the freshness of the food and many other things but the for the most part the other reviews hit on the right things. Damn fine cup of coffee, great challah, good orange juice, good portions, friendly service and considering the area - decent price. The booths are cramped but that is something that's easy to forget with all the pluses."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been to The Senator 5 times for dinner.  each time everything was wonderful, there was absolutely nothing to find fault with.  The food was good, the service was fast and friendly and we left feeling happy, because we'd had an excellent experience.  
We enjoyed a variety of items on the menu and the desserts are
Amazing.  All in all a great experience.  I would highly recommend the Senator."}
{"text":"They seem to have a lot of history and what not, but honestly the food wasn't worth the prices at all. The prices especially for dinner are like a fine dining restaurant whereas everything else about the place is like a mom & pop diner. The food isn't terrible but man is it overpriced! 

Be careful about the small diner-ish look of this place before you step in, because chances are you are going to spend upwards of $40."}
{"text":"The Senator doesn't disappoint. Both times I've been for brunch I've had the huevos rancheros and it is fantastic! The cornbread is to die for! The service is always great, everyone is super friendly. Only drawback is that it can get crowded especially in the winter with everyone's parkas everywhere. 
Sidenote: we had a celeb spotting there - Leslie Roberts of GlobalTV!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy! Finally got a table for a weekday brunch and was happy I did. Service was fine. The seating area is a bit cramped as the restaurant is quite small. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros which was absolutely delicious. The black beans were flavourful and the cornbread was very tasty. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Reading about the history of the restaurant is also very interesting while you're waiting for your food. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Got a pretty standard breakfast and it was okay. Two eggs, bacon, baked beans, and toast. Don't have much to say beyond it being pretty standard - the bacon was too crispy for my liking but I find most breakfast places just cook bacon to a crisp instead of keeping some of its texture. I have regrets."}
{"text":"I truly adore this place. Only wish I lived closer. 

The atmosphere is amazing. It's bustling on a weekday lunch. Smiling faces, engaged conversations, servers walking up and down the aisles, a small line of people waiting at the front for their tables, expensive looking espresso maker at front..... 

The place is filled with large and small booths, dark wood panels, and dim lighting. I would describe the Senator as a classy diner. 

They have a big menu but I settled for the Senator breakfast which came with 2 eggs, challah toast, 5 slices of bacon, potatoes, beans, and coffee. All this for $8! An excellent breakfast deal.

Let me tell you a secret. This is the best diner coffee I have ever had. Seriously - you need to try this. 

My over medium eggs were perfect with just a bit of runny yolk and not overdone. Challah toast was slightly sweet and delicious!!! I could eat 10 slices if they gave it to me. 

Service was super friendly but super slow. I had the time but I saw some customers wait a long time for their order and couldn't even enjoy it when it did come because they needed to get back to work. Not the place to come for lunch if you have an hour lunch break. Because it literally took 45 minutes for the food to come after the order. I didn't mind though. This is the place to come to enjoy great food at great prices with great company. Or if you don't have company, you can easily strike conversations with people around you. Some of their booths are awfully close to one another. My booth was literally side by side with a couple of guys and I could hear their entire conversation. 

I was super happy after lunch. My only regret is, why did it take me so long to discover this place? Once again, thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"The food was average - I tried the crab cakes, fries, and leek and potato soup. The soup could've used more leeks and the crab cakes could use more crab... 

The service was the worst part... our server was nice enough but also very odd. I checked in my Yelp app and found a coupon for dinner and presented it to my server to have her yell at me and say that I didn't eat dinner...(not sure what I was eating then). Okay... don't honour the coupon but also, please don't yell at a paying customer. So I asked if my friend could use the coupon as she had ordered a dinner entrée and she said no because she didn't order dessert and a coffee... I didn't see that anywhere on the coupon, it was like she was just making it up and angry at us for even asking for a discount. I won't be returning any time soon.

The décor was awesome, very \"old school\" diner vibes with tiny booths. The atmosphere made me feel a bit like an outsider as a lot of people seem to know each other, I can only assume they're part of the theatre crowd because it was very busy at one point and then dead by the next."}
{"text":"I have only been here for breakfast. Usually I like to try different things, but not here. The reason is the eggs. I like mine over easy. But the eggs here are very different. They are the best eggs I have ever had - ever!! The yolks are orange in color and taste amazing. So I always get the eggs. I may change up the meat I get with them, but I never miss a chance to have their eggs."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Solid, relaxed neighbourhood diner with lots of history (Toronto's oldest restaurant - who knew?). Dining options around Yonge/Dundas are pretty unexciting and touristy, so this is a great option if you're in the 'hood. I have come here twice for lunch on weekdays. The service is fast enough that you could be in and out in 1 hour. I like the memorabilia all over the restaurant and the space-efficient layout (the restaurant is not that big, but the booths are close together). I like the cozy corner booths. The menu is fairly standard. I recommend the Cumbrae's beef burger. The beef is so tasty on its own that you don't really want to overload it with extra toppings. I got mine with a side salad. The other time, I had the Chilli which was very, very filling and just a little bit spicy. It comes with a nice, warm piece of corn bread. Nice to see a place like this still thriving as trendy restaurant come and go. 

FYI - they also offer take-out."}
{"text":"A great choice for breakfast in downtown Toronto!  

You know you're in a great restaurant when you see a line of customers waiting to be seated in the small restaurant. Lucky for me I was traveling solo and snagged a seat at the counter. 

There were so many items on the menu that looked delicious.  I told them that I never had the peameal bacon (Toronto's signature dish), so I ordered the breakfast plate. It was nothing like I expected. I really imagined for some reason smashed peas and bacon, but what it really is pork loin rolled and cured in corn meal.  

The texture and taste, reminded me of spam as I took a bite into it. 

The staff here were all very nice, attentive and very friendly. They really do know how to please their customers. I was checked on quite often while they ensured my coffee was topped off.

If you're looking for a place to eat around Dundas and Yonge, I highly recommend a visit to the historic The Senator.  Founded in 1929, it claims to be the oldest restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"An institution in Toronto. If you have the time (there may be a long line) is absolutely great at any meal. It is only 25% more or so than your average diner (e.g. Fran's) but the quality is 80% better.

Portions can vary so you may want to do a hand motion to understand what you are getting. 

Lastly, you may recognise this true diner from many NYC \"based\" movies and it does absolutely retain that era feel."}
{"text":"Nice place, very cozy, friendly staff and timely service. I had a burger here and I liked it."}
{"text":"Cool place with that old school classic diner feel, and the service is pretty good. We were underwhelmed by the food the first couple of times we went, but the third time we both got the burger and it is outrageously good. Maybe the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"The set-up during its busy hours is weird -- you just go and stand in line outside (there isn't a host(ess) that takes your name at the door). We waited about 15 minutes so not too long. It's so cozy and cute inside. I loved the booths. My husband and I had the Really Big Breakfast and it was amazing. The challah toast and jam were my favorites, but everything was good."}
{"text":"On a getaway weekend, my husband and I came here for breakfast both days. Really good coffee. We were very pleased with the French toast, banana pancakes, and Benedict Popeye that we had. I'm a snob about syrup, and was pleased to find that they serve real maple syrup. Waitstaff was energetic and friendly. As we are from New Jersey, we are big diner aficionados. The Senator was a great find."}
{"text":"This is such an adorable little place tucked on a street that I barely go to. My friend and I had to wait for a table but since it was just the two of us, the wait wasn't long. I don't remember what I ordered but I do remember that I was very full from the meal and it wasn't expensive. I definitely recommend anybody who wants good and reasonably priced breakfast food to come here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and eggs as well as the fruit salad. Steak was well done when we ordered rare, fruit salad was clearly UNWASHED- dirty blueberries and rotten strawberries , pears, and raspberries. Honestly stay away from the fruit - I could get a fruit salad at loblaws for four bucks and it would taste better"}
{"text":"I came here three times during my stay in Toronto for Halloween. I just want to say I love the staff that works here! They're so much fun to talk to and very friendly. It really does contribute towards a wonderful experience at the oldest restaurant still standing in Toronto! All of their food, condiments and juices are quality and fresh! I like to get the grapefruit juice as its freshly squeezed and the coffee is good as well. The jam that they use is really addicting and tastes great on the challah toast, pancakes or french toast. If you're with a group of people, you should order a couple stacks of pancakes and french toast to share. The Senator Breakfast is one of my go-to entrees but the open-faced omelets are good as well. The home fries were okay and I've had better but I highly recommend the french toast!"}
{"text":"Whoa! That beet salad took me by surprised. I randomly came here since it was close to my hotel & was craving something light. I'm glad that I did!

I loved the nuttiness of the pumpkin seeds & the tartness of the pomegranate bits in this salad. It's pretty much a deconstructed beet salad with slices of beets laid out & the components sprinkled on top of them. Regardless, all the parts of this salad complimented one another.

Awesome friendly staff. Really helpful with suggestions. +1 for that!

The Senator is decorated like an old school English diner. Very homey & comfortable booths. Great for small groups! And go ahead & check in for happy hour deals :)"}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Two dishes I recommend are the eggs Benedict with salmon and the Cesar salad with blackened chicken. 
The place has character. Don't expect contemporary restaurant service. Expect old school diner service. Friendly people and foods are sourced locally."}
{"text":"Sure I get it. The allure of one instance being in what might be the busiest area in all of Toronto(sheer madness really), to just a few steps away walking into a diner that looks like it's been frozen in time. It's pretty cool to tell you the truth. 

The Senator is serving tradition diner fare. Large portions and fair prices is the primary attraction. 

The Challah toast is definitely a hit. There's also no way you're leaving hungry but beyond that, id say overall it's all pretty ordinary. 

Note: maybe it's the American in me, but 30 minutes from order to delivery for breakfast during the hustle and bustle of a city morning seems a bit extreme."}
{"text":"*the tables and seats were dirty and greasy. Yes I understand the diner is old, but that doesn't mean they should stop cleaning the tables and mopping the floor.
*my server spent all her time talking to other customers and servers instead of checking up on us. We didn't receive our water until an old man noticed and gave us halfway through the meal. 

Ordered:
-Huevos Rancheros: 
My initial reaction: how is this a Huevos Rancheros?! My server didn't bother to ask me how I would like my eggs to be done. At least give me sunny side up then, why give me poached eggs? Also, all of these ingredients seemed to be cooked separately, then the chef decided to dump everything on the plate last minute. The eggs and salsa were stone cold, overcooked and rubbery chorizo, then that dry cornbread...

-Smoked Salmon and eggs: 
2 pieces of smoked salmon, lukewarm baked beans for $15? Not worth it. 

-Fruit Smoothie:
The smoothie was average as well, you can definitely taste the yogurt and berries, not so much the banana though.

Verdict: Will never return. I can't stand rude servers, below average food and it was overpriced."}
{"text":"The best eggs and bacon I've had, hands down.  And coming from someone who considers brunch a hobby, that's saying a lot.  

We sure are lucky in Toronto to have a diner of this calibre and with such a storied history.  Stepping in the door you feel like you've stepped back in time, from the neon sign outside, to the brown booths and rounded tablets, to the old coca cola machine, and right down to the old-timey cash register. The owners have really kept the spot feeling like what you'd imagine a pre-WWII diner would be like, when people took their time enjoying a meal and each other's company.

The most important part - the food. I was really impressed not only that they had diary-free alternatives for coffee, but they even had more than 1 option (Soy OR almond - your choice!). I was actually able to have a coffee with my brunch (take a note, Fran's). I also have no idea how they scrambled my eggs without milk and had them come out creamy, fluffy and the perfect temperature. The bacon was perfectly crisp. The baked beans were a great touch, and loved the onion thrown into the homefries. Just so, down home, good. 

Also loved that we were left to linger and not pushed out the door. Even after we paid, our waitress came around with more coffee. Such a lovely spot, my new go to for sure. Keep on doing your thing, Senator."}
{"text":"Great services. Hot and delicious food!
Although the line can be long sometimes, it's worth the wait. Very quick and polite staff"}
{"text":"Love diners and love brunches...but I'm very disappointed at this highly rated spot.

I ordered the salmon eggs benny with salad and coffee. We didn't wait long for our food to arrive. I love bennies but I'm not terribly picky with them; however the sauce was pathetic and it barely had any creamy-flavoury taste to it. Smoked salmon and the english muffin was mediocre, and nothing exciting about the salad.

My friend ordered tea and found a long piece of hair in the tea immediately after she poured it into her cup from the pot. We told our server and he took it away with just a simple, unapologetic \"sorry\"..... He came back with what we thought was a new pot of tea, but the tea was so tasteless that it really seemed like he just added more hot water to the pot...

Friend also got the senators breakfast which was nothing special. 

For the rest of the meal, there was no mention of the hair, never checked up on us or asked for a water/tea/coffee refill while he was standing right in front of our table at a stand. Another server saw our cups empty and asked us if we wanted more water.

The only great thing about the place is probably the coffee..the coffee was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic breakfast. Had French toast and freshly squeezed orange juice. Mom and pop experience. Great muffins"}
{"text":"You must get the French toast it is phenomenal!!!!! The challah bread is so delicious and thick and full of flavor. I also got the Canadian bacon because obviously I'm in Canada, how can I not, and that was great it was a more succulent ham. The mulled cider was perfect for the chilly weather and our server was amazing. Not only did she give us a discount due to the wait but she also gave us an extensive list of places to visit. I'm not sure of her name but she was blonde with cool tattoos on her arm and had visited Boston so cheers to you. The manager, I believe, was also very hands on. This is a must try place."}
{"text":"I lived just down the street from The Senator for 2  1/2 years when I 1st moved downtown but I never managed to get there until today.  Based on my overall impression, I certainly wish I'd started going there a long time ago.  The venue has been around since the late 1940's and not very surprisingly has the look, feel and layout of that 'era'.  It also appears quite fresh and clean inside; I was with 3 others for brunch and it was fairly crowded while we were there and gradually became even more so before we left.

I ordered their breakfast sausage with (scrambled) eggs which also came with home fries, toast and baked beans.  I found everything delicious and the service very prompt and friendly.  The venue appears to be a great, convenient downtown location for a meal with a small group of people or by yourself, therefore I would also recommend it to those visiting Toronto - they offer a wide variety of fairly reasonably priced dishes."}
{"text":"Breakfast done right. Farm fresh food made really well. We can vouch for the salmon plate and the eggs Benedict. The rest of the menu looked equally delicious! Classic breakfast menu, excellent preparation. Can you tell I loved it? Nice owner. A fellow beekeeper and organic farmer."}
{"text":"One of the last few true diners in toronto and the oldest restaurant in toronto. Its got an old school charm to it. This place has been featured in many places including \"You gotta eat here\" and the Monocle guide books. I can understand the charm, but the food is pretty average. The service was more friendly than I would expect from a diner. 

The system is to stand in line until a hostess seats you. No need to get a number or to put your name down. Just stand, which makes it a bit awkward as some other potential patrons don't understand personal space. You get a bill at your table, but walk up to pay at the cashier. 

We went for breakfast/brunch. My friends got the senator breakfast and I got the burger. The burger was average - nothing special and a bit under seasoned. The shoe-string fries were not bad. Prices are slightly above average compared to other diners. 

They pride themselves on fresh, local-ish ingredients. (i.e. farm fresh, organic milk, cumbraes meat, etc.) The cream for the coffee had little pieces of curd in it, but the waitress said its because its so fresh... Skeptical at the time, but no one got sick."}
{"text":"I went for Brunch this Tuesday and ordered Jam & Toast, Egg Benedict and fish and chips. Don't judge, I was hungry and didn't have breakfast!! My boyfriend ordered Pancake and Bacon.

Overall, the experience was worthwhile. I was very taken aback by their jam, it was very special. But I was expecting something more spectacular in the egg benedict. It was okay but considering the price it came short in experience. I had a bite on my bf's pancake and it was really good. Chips were little soggy. But overall we left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"What a delicious breakfast!! I must say the Salmon Egg Benedict are definitely on my top 5! The service was also great my server was very attentive!"}
{"text":"The earlier you come, the better :p

It can get quite busy, so I would recommend coming at 11 or earlier.

The three of us ordered the Senator Breakfast, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I feel like I am bashing a great place (per so many good reviews) but two major things bothered me about this spot. The first was the menu, one page, no breakfast items at all. I see people claiming to have come here at dinner time and ordering breakfast?? Guess that was discontinued. They had a \"Summer Menu\" of like 10 apps, 10 mains. I enjoyed the ceasar salad, but not the PEI mussels with ramen, over cooked and soggy. Just not good. No desserts at all?  The cost was my other problem. Disappointed to find a new place and to be moving on."}
{"text":"What is left to say about this place. It has been at the same building for over 60 years. The interior is beautiful diner setup, very cozy and friendly. All the posters, memorabilia, and signs reminded you of a simpler time. The food is amazing, especially the toast. It is made in house and it is sweet, soft and delicious. The varieties of breakfast options are great as well. Will go back to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We arrived too late for the breakfast so ended up having the mac n' cheese instead. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"We are retirees staying in downtown Toronto for three nights. Based on proximity and Yelp reviews we ended up at the Senator in lieu of the restaurant at our huge hotel the first morning we were in town. 

When we travel we try to frequent where the locals eat and it was obvious Senator has been popular with locals for decades.  

Depending when you go there is a fast moving line to the door. At 8-9 AM you are quickly seated. 

We liked the place so much we ate breakfast here each of the 3 days we were in town.

Claire (2 days) and Michelle (1) were friendly, attentive and professional. They are on our all star team from many cities where we have traveled. I don't know names of the food prep team but they did a great job. 

If you are in town near Yonge and Gerry/Dundas this is the place to go for breakfast and I'll bet lunch or dinner also. 

Order \"The Senator\" for breakfast and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and really enjoyed it. Great cup of coffee, had the yogurt surprise (lots of fresh fruit, granola, with shaved coconut!) and a side of sausage. Wife had eggs, Challah toast (fantastic!), and baked beans. The staff was polite, charming, and attentive without pestering us. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem of a little diner in downtown Toronto. I went here with my wife and my brother and wow it was so good. We got giant breakfast dishes with all sorts of delicious food. I think my plate was called the \"real good plate\" or something like that. Anyway it was so much good food. Definitely stop in and try one of these breakfast combos."}
{"text":"Tight little spot but the food is amazing! Great diner spot. I got scrambled eggs and salmon. Amazing! The goat cheese was an interesting touch to it. Service was nice, the waiter was lovely. Only complaint is that it took forever to get his attention to ask for the bill."}
{"text":"the seats and tables are a bit squishy, but there isn't a thing that i'd change about the décor. 

i've been to almost every early morning breakfast place in toronto east of bathurst and south of bloor. imho, the senator is the best. the eggs are very fresh. the coffee is very good. even the milk is organic. 

it's just slightly more expensive than other diners, but the quality at the senator more than makes up for it.
 
the only point of contention for me is the service. it's inconsistent."}
{"text":"I had high expectations on my first visit to the Senator and unfortunately, my expectations remain unmet.

We arrived at about 11:45 and there was a line at the door already. I've never been here so I had no idea it was so small. My colleague had suggested we get there early and I was glad we did. We were seated not long after and were able to check out the menu. Definitely not suitable for groups.

Sadly, what I wanted wasn't available at lunch time (off the breakfast menu) so I ended up with a grilled cheese and my friend and I split an order of fries. She got the grain bowl and a mushroom soup.

The food came pretty quickly and the grilled cheese was good, if nothing special. Lots of REAL cheese, nicely toasted. Came with a side of forgettable coleslaw that I tried to get into a few times but ended up left on the plate. The fries were good but were either under cooked or had been sitting around for a while because they certainly weren't crisp and hot out of the fryer. I got a coke as my drink and when they delivered a bottle of coke, old school bottle, my friend commented how neat it was. Well... if I'd known it was gonna cost me $3 for one bottle of pop, I would have had water.

When the bill came, I was SHOCKED that our modest lunch had cost us almost $45! My friend had soup, the grain bowl and a coffee and we split fries, I had the grilled cheese and a bottle of pop. I was really surprised to see that a side of fries cost $4.50. What??? Potatoes cost NOTHING. My friend had commented her coffee tasted terrible (and that she would normally have had three cups of theirs because she likes it so much) and they took it off the bill. We would have been over $50 if that had been on our bill.

The Senator is an institution... and I have no idea why. Maybe I need to try some more dishes but this is not the epitome of diner food that I came expecting. The menu was actually surprisingly small, most of the lunch/dinner page is all drinks/specialty coffee. The restaurant itself is small, small enough that it would be a deterrent to me coming back with anyone. I work at Ryerson and went with a colleague. If we'd wanted to talk about anything work-related, would have had plenty of eavesdroppers. I felt like the people at the next table were on top of us and some of the other patrons were disruptively noisy simply because of how close we were to each other. I also felt like this place was just too hustle bustle for me - with how small it was, I felt like that amplified the busy atmosophere.

My friend was super excited to hear that the Senator was doing Vegan Fridays, as she'd been told the last time she was there, but today they weren't doing it because they \"didn't have time\". You really shouldn't advertise something like that, that caters to a set of folks with specific dietary needs, unless you're going to come through reliably.

On the way out, my friend was raving about their cookies so she bought us two, one to split and one to take home to my hubby. Nothing special and certainly not worth the $7 for two cookies that she paid (no tax). I was looking forward to a soft delicious cookie and its basically just crumbly and sad. Disappointing at best, I won't even bother finishing my half of the half cookie, its going in the garbage.

Overall, a disappointing visit to a Toronto institution. I have no plans to go back and try anything else; if I want a good, tasty, filling, affordable lunch, there are TONS of other places nearby where you won't have to wait for a teeny booth and overpriced food. Frankly, if you want greasy spoon diner food, go down the road to Frans. I'm always happy with the food I get there, the portions are generous and the price is right for what you're getting."}
{"text":"I trusted Yelp for its good reviews of this restaurant but unfortunately i was disappointed. 
I ordered the Senators breakfast and it came with tea/coffee. As soon as i got my tea i poured some to my cup but the tea was super light. i thought i had to leave it to steep longer so i waited for about 5 mins.

After waiting for a few mins i poured some more tea to my cup but it still looks super light. Coincidentally i also saw a hair in my tea and told the waiter right away. The waiter only said a \"sorry\" and replaced it with another tea. Yet, the new tea was still too light and bland.

The senator breakfast was nothing special. The potato wedges were dry, burnt and bland. The beans were sweet (not my style) and the scrambled eggs were not even scrambled. The eggs were dry and bland (my baby cousin can make better scrambled eggs) and last but not least, the bacon was dry and hard. 

I thought the good reviews will do the restaurant justice but after experiencing this restaurant, it was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The upstairs is very nice and the staff is accommodating as hell. House coffee was solid I had like 4 cups. Doesn't feel like you're in downtown Toronto, the croque madame made me sh*t madame pants but it was so good. Bacon is decent and do not wait in line downstairs not worth it."}
{"text":"Checked out The Senator for the first time for brunch and I was not impressed. I think because I have heard a lot of great things about their brunch, my expectations were too high. I was craving an egg Benny, and was excited to learn that instead of an English muffin they use a biscuit. Unfortunately, I recently had pretty much the exact same dish at Emma's Kitchen, and Emma does a great biscuit & hollandaise. 

I found the biscuit and potatoes at The Senator really dry. I was specially disappointed by the potatoes - tough and dry - couldn't finish them. The coffee was alright, but too pricey for just plain 'ol drip coffee ($3+). 

On a positive note, the service was great, we got seated quickly (we arrived at 10am), and my friend really enjoyed the pancakes. 

Glad I checked them out and can remove this popular brunch restaurant off my list. Been there! :)"}
{"text":"Great little diner. Small and intimate.  Family of five seated quickly. Great breakfast food. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Just ate here last night. I had the clubhouse and a strawberry shake. Both were delicious and I loved the atmosphere. Very cool downtown old school dinner."}
{"text":"Been in Toronto for over a decade and finally got around to going to Senator's! Breakfast and staff were great. It's a small and busy place. Enjoyed the food, the staff was appropriately chatty. Recommended for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Must try: Fries

I think I should clarify that we ate dinner here instead of breakfast, which is what they are known for. So I can really only comment on the dinner, which in short, is unspectacular.

The fish in the fish and chips was not flavourful and not the best cut of fish. The chicken supreme was ok, but I don't think it warrants the price ($26) since it tasted like any typical chicken dish from a catering place. The burger looked good but I didn't try. The thin cut Fries were decent though, when you can get ketchup out of the glass bottle it's a great combo.

The thing that slightly irked me was the price... We got the crab cake to share which was already $16, but there were only two so the waiter suggested we add one more for our party of three, that extra piece was $5 alone. If it was sweet meaty crab then maybe... But I'm sorry I can't taste the difference between that and any other slightly salted, shredded crab meat mash. I don't know, maybe I was biased by the $$$.

The service was good though, we really liked our waitress. May come to try out the brunch menu."}
{"text":"I've always had a soft spot for the Senator since it was one of the first restaurants I ever ate at when I moved to Toronto almost eight years ago. Beside the charming authentic decor, the restaurant's classic menu card can really take you back to a simpler time. 

Rather than go with my usual trusty ol' big breakfast, I tried the huevos rancheros on my most recent visit. The plain as can be cornbread was damn good and served as a sweet sidekick to the spicy chorizo slices. Tea is served in the tiniest individual tea pots, but hot water refills come easily enough.

Kitschy salt and pepper shaker displays are somewhat commonplace at brunch spots these days, but I can bet that this is pretty much where it all started."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing. The bread itself is worth coming for (a delicious challah). The staff are super friendly. Also, you do yourself a disservice if you don't try their chocolate cookies!"}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch/brunch with a friend because it was in the area she wanted to stay in. She had the eggs benedict and I had the Turkey BLT. Wow this is a real greasy spoon type of restaurant. It's not my style at all. The turkey was over seasoned with salt and the fries were also too salty. The diner is also very narrow. Because it's so narrow the place is really noisy and people are sitting cheek to jowl basically. If you don't mind being so close to strangers then you'd like this place. Waitstaff were nice but they all looked so tired. I like the history of this place but I don't think I'd eat here again. I'm disappointed.

I have to add that because my friend wasn't there yet when I lined up they didn't seat me. Rather they let someone else with a party of two get seated. That was a little irritating but understandable given the limited space here."}
{"text":"we visited this restaurant on 0/29/2015, we went to the senator for lunch. i had a chicken ceasar salad which was ok but the chicken was very good, extremely moist  my sister had the canadian blt, which she thought was just ok. our friend got the canadian blt also, and she thought it was just ok.. the wine was fine that we ordered, but the meal was not what we were expecting based on the price"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, my dad and I were looking for a place to eat not far from our hotel and we consulted our AAA guide book which directed us here for dinner.  Very small in the sense that its super narrow.   I ended up getting the mac and cheese and caesar salad for dinner, both which were very tasty.  All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked amazing.   For dessert I got sticky toffee pudding which made me very happy.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone, plus its right by the very popular Eaton Square (I hope that's right!), which seemed very busy as there was a major festival going on while I was there."}
{"text":"Was here the middle of last week with a buddy for lunch... not too busy as we planned on missing the lunch crowd arriving around 1:45 pm.... greeted immediately upon entry and told to take any seat we liked... I ordered the fish and chips while my buddy got the burger... tasty fish, serving a little small, fries good.... buddy's burger was okay but to quote, \" wouldn't come back just for the burger \" but not disappointed either.... total with a bottle of water and an earl grey tea was around $30... worth a trip as food was good.... service was even better... decor is so retro diner!!!!"}
{"text":"Having missed out on Evelyn's Elite Event (EEE) at the Senator due to weather in July, we decided to check it out on our own for brunch after a friend's downtown wedding.

Arrived around noon on a Saturday and there was a small wait for a table for four.  We noticed that those double decker bus tours stop right in front so a lot of the clientele were either tourists or theatre patrons looking for some food before their matinee across the street at the Canon Theatre.

Once seated, we perused the menu.  I went with the Senator breakfast ($9.95) - eggs, bacon, Challah toast, beans, home fries and coffee.  Others ordered the Steak and Eggs ($13.95).

Food came to the table in a decent time.  Service was okay as well.

Loved the old school feeling of the diner but breakfast was just average.  I'm not in the downtown 'hood that ofter anyway so we probably wouldn't seek it out again."}
{"text":"Based on the history of this establishment I want to love it but the food was very bland.  I ordered the meatloaf and my husband had the fried chicken.    I had to add a lot of salt to taste anything about my meal.  It is standard diner fare which tries to be fancier.  Best part of the meal was the brownie sundae for dessert - but who doesn't love a brownie sundae?!  The food was good - waitress was great - but the chef needs to invest in spices and salt for me to rate the food as great."}
{"text":"Thank God for the Senator. 

As foodies we lurch from trend to trend, our consciences flowering and withering with the seasons. In summer and fall, we pig out on local and sustainable food. By winter, we realize that we live in Canada, and the only local food is ice, which will keep our drinks fresh but otherwise provide cold comfort. We flit around the globe and flirt with regional cuisines, debating the authenticity of our city's reproductions despite never setting foot outside the continent. It's fun, but occasionally demanding. 

Sometimes you just want a good burger, salad or mildly greasy breakfast, and that's what the Senator delivers; quickly, and with a smile. 

The Senator's breakfast is legendary.  Basic food groups are all represented; protein, carbs, bacon, more bacon, and other stuff that I don't care about. A request for burnt bacon results in properly crispy curlicues that shatter on contact with my fork, splintering into perfectly over-easy eggs, through which I drag slices of challah toast. Good homefried potatoes, Baked beans and token fruit garnish make up the rest of the plate. It's nothing I couldn't make at home, but tastes so much better because all I had to do was roll out of bed and choose the right direction on the subway. 

The lunch/dinner menu sticks to reliable favourites. Grilled cheese arrives on more challah; sunny orange melting into dense egg bread, which in turn is fried to a golden crisp. It comes with salad or fries. Both are good, but you didn't come here for salad, did you?

If you did, you're better off with a roaring garlic Caesar, or the Cobb, which with it's combination of iceberg, tomato, bacon, blue cheese, chicken and avocado, may just be nature's most perfect food. An appetizer wedge salad riffs on many of the same flavours. in summer, the travel-hearty lettuce is a subtle rebuke to effete local baby organic kissy kissy shmoopypants mesclun blends. 

Yes, I just questioned the manhood of salad greens. 

A Monte Cristo sandwich is surprisingly light, while the club features in-house roasted, slightly overcooked chicken, and more of that fabulous bacon with fresh tomatoes on more challah. Burgers are just damn beefy good. To write more would do an injustice to this noble former cow. 

Fish and chips covers a massive plate. Cole slaw is puckeringly sour, but a good contrast to beer batter and lovely thin fries. The fish itself is fresh; two pieces make for a massive dinner. Macaroni and cheese is never as good as homemade, but not for want of trying. The full-of-stuff version is a rare departure from the menu's penchant for classics. While bacon, mushrooms and caramelized onions do wonders for burgers, they make my inner five year old-you know, the one who would pay more than ten bucks for a plate of noodles in cheese sauce-weep. Stick to the basic version. Get a salad on the side so you can say you ate your vegetables. 


Coffee varies from dishwater to delicious, depending on who mans the pot.  Unsweetened iced tea (a rarity in Toronto) renders it unnecessary. A pity that they charge for it by the glass. I yearn for a better refill policy.

Desserts vary, including fresh fruit pies in season. I'm sure they're delicious, but I rarely finish my main plate, much less order more. 

You can't go wrong here. Simple food, served in a room steeped in diner history, by a family that once literally anchored Toronto's downtown. Let the neighbourhood change; whether surrounded by crumbling hotels and peeler bars, or hidden by futuristic condos and mega malls, I'll take the Senator just as it is."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, The Senator is actually pretty good for old WASP-Toronto haute-diner fare, but just like in Toronto the Good of auld, expect to pay for it - two meals, a salad and a milkshake (yep, we're classy): a stiff 100$.  But you need reservations.  (And if you can get there before the theatre-going supper rush, your kids are even welcome.)"}
{"text":"A nice recommendation from friends. A classic diner atmosphere. Good hearty breakfast fare. A nice way to fuel up before a day exploring Toronto. 

The side of sausage is a not overly spiced, just a good pork sausage, that lets the meat taste come through. The sweet chili sauce is a great side to eggs and home fries."}
{"text":"Classic old school diner food. but this is not \"retro\" it's the real deal. I don't know who they have in the kitchen but he's a master of the art. The service was fast, friendly and very capable. The prices are righteous. 

My friend and I had some amazing pumpkin soup. She had a perfect grilled cheese and ham and I had the fruit plate (excellent!)  

It's been in business since the 1920s with the current family having taken over in the 40s. They just don't make places like this anymore. If you like this kind of down to earth food, you won't find better. 

I hear it's jammed on the weekends, so we forewarned. We had breakfast there one weekday (excellent) and lunch another (excellent.) It was jumping, but not too busy .

Note: It doesn't look like a classic diner. I'd say it's got more of a lunch counter look with tables in the back."}
{"text":"After reading over the yelp reviews I decided to come here for breakfast. All I can say is I am so upset with myself for not coming here sooner! The food and the customer service exceeded my expectations. 

Upon arrival I was greeted by a friendly red headed gentleman named Chris who answered all my questions with a smile and chatted up with my boyfriend as they watched sports on his iPad while we waited in line. He was so friendly he made the ten min wait for a table go by extremely fast. That is the type of person you want as the face of toe business. Friendly and informative.

As soon as we were seated I knew I had to try the pancakes because they do not use box mix (I detest box mix) and they are made from scratch. I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled eggs combo and the yogurt pancakes with caramelized bananas inside. The smokes salmon combo was great I love the potato hash it's seasoned well and they serve challa bread (it's amazing everyone should) but the pancakes were unreal! I literally inhaled them. My first thought when they were finished was I'm coming back here tomorrow for breakfast. 

My new pancake spot when I'm downtown for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family. There is no kids menu, but there are kid friendly choices available. My son had the Mac n cheese and my daughter had the hamburger. They both enjoyed their meals. I had the salmon entree and Apple Pie in a Glass, which was amazing. The staff is all very friendly, great service. It was a little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and great service! Our server was very nice and passionate about the restaurant. We will come again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"No frills place to have a breakfast. They offer a nice selection with an option to customize your order if need be. I've been here 3 times already and every time I leave with my tummy full. The interior is from 1970s, but I suppose that's exactly what gives it its charm. They could introduce more variety into their breakfast options like Le Cartet in Montreal or Karine's in Toronto. Bottom line, this is a solid option for nice and hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Went here for brunch with the girls today. Very cool old school diner vibe. Lots of booths but they are a tight squeeze, a big & tall person would probably be quite cramped sitting in one.

Portions were huge. I had 2 eggs, peameal bacon, baked beans, home fries and challah bread with free coffee for $9.95. Food was delicious. Not overly greasy. My friend's huevos rancheros looks awesome too. 

The food came quick but we had a bit of trouble flagging the waitress to get our coffees topped up."}
{"text":"Everything has been said about this place already, so I just want to add a quick overview of my experience. Whoever thinks this place is overpriced - consider the area! 

I thought it was a great deal for breakfast, around $20 for two people with endless coffee. The service was fine, lots of smiles and very quick. Our breakfast was delicious (The Senator Breakfast) and so is the homemade raspberry jam. Definitely a great spot. I witnessed the staff accommodating a group with a baby since they couldn't all fit into the booth. That's what I like to see! 

The layout of The Senator is quite unique. I will be back to sit in all the other booths :P"}
{"text":"Huevos Rancheros were super, the cornbread is perfect.

Great staff and coffee is plentiful.

Pancakes are to die for.  A food destination when I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"This place has/had good food as the other reviews suggested, nothing extra-ordinary, but always good. What made the Senator special for many years before I learned to appreciate it and the few that I did, was Jazz.
This was an amazing Jazz joint, unlike any other I have seen in Toronto. It seems that this scene is very quickly dying in the area in Toronto that is giving way to cheap, Times Square- like feel with tons of standard restaurant chains such as Milestone and Johnny Rockets. 
Toronto culture will miss the real Senator:

{"text":"Friend brought me here for breakfast. It was good! Friendly service and they keep your coffee cup filled. Does get busier for brunch so I would advise getting there early!"}
{"text":"Came here around 1 pm. There was a big line up at the front and almost no room to move amongst the waiting customers. It took almost 30 min to get seated. The waiter was very polite and joked around quite a bit.  The pancake was the right texture and tasted great. I'm not a big fan of beans for breakfast (it was sweet). Their coffee was great and they serve it with their own special milk, which was also great. The atmosphere is very casual and cozy. It was a pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Great place. Fairly affordable. Good service. Laid back. If I lived in the city or was staying nearby, I'd check it out again."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch spot right at Dundas and Yonge. The restaurant has been here since 1948 and has been thriving ever since. I got the Eggs Benedict and it was perfect. The venue is like a classics diner and service was speedy. Popular on weekend mornings but the wait is usually around 10 to 20 minutes. Right across the street from the Ed Mervish theatre. Great for groups of 4!"}
{"text":"Solid little brunch place in Toronto. Pretty good pancakes and challah bread! Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for brunch and in the area."}
{"text":"What a jewel! A great spot with so much history. Service was solid, as was the food. My friend had cured salmon. Spot on! I had poached eggs, ham and toast. Exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Nice small diner and hidden gem. I wish I had known about this place before. I didn't make it in time for breakfast so I opted for the Senator Burger. I've never been asked how I wanted my burger done so I froze and said medium, though I wish I said well done. 
The burger itself was delicious. A large juicy beef patty inbetween two plain buns with the tomato, lettuce, caramelized onion and corn relish on the side along with thin and crispy fries. With a burger that big, it was impossible to eat without getting messy, but it's sooo worth it. 

Will definitely be back to try their eggs benny!"}
{"text":"Nice place in general, very friendly stuff, but the food was not something special. we had a meat loaf and a pork tenderloin. both were decent but nothing that I would remember (i have eaten much tastier tenderloins at other places). clean restaurant, and pretty quiet. they gave us a small gift when we were leaving!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Toronto . Old fashioned kind of diner, this is recommended by trip advisor. The popeye egg Benedict was fresh and savory. The steak and eggs were great. Although I must say the steak as far as texture is way different from steak in the states... baked beans with maple syrup was recommended as a must try. It was a little too sweet for my tooth however, it's a worth trying a Canadian staple."}
{"text":"Went to The Senator for breakfast on Sunday morning around 9. My wife and I were seated right away and started with coffee and tea. The food was fantastic!! The pancakes, potatoes, bacon and eggs were all cooked as ordered! We plan on going back for breakfast on Monday before we leave Toronto to hit Niagara Falls. Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"They have best coffee in town. Smooth cappuccino did impressed me a lot. Their signature Burger was great too"}
{"text":"Really nice! Food was good! Very friendly environment...only thing is the waitresses were joking around in the front while other people were waiting in the line and i think it killed the vibe a bit on a Saturday morning where people come get breakfast and leave. Besides that really loved it. Had their steak and eggs 6oz steak is really small."}
{"text":"My dad use to go here decades ago and decided to take me here last weekend. I wasn't expecting much out of this place but I tagged along just to catch up with the old man. Our service was quick and the food... well I couldn't believe the quality I received. It was great and I am an automatic repeat customer. I live in North Toronto and I will drive down just to eat here."}
{"text":"Given the decor, I was expecting this to be a diner. It's a fancy restaurant in the body of a diner, which is a little confusing, but just go with it. Apparently you can make reservations, which is how we knew it was not at all a diner.

The food was way better than expected, so while I was anticipating a cheap and fast dinner and it ended up being expensive and slow, I was still happy. The steak was pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here early for brunch on a weekend. It was a bit of a wait, and the line was going out the door! Tucked away on Victoria Street, but very close to the Eaton Centre makes for a great location. After waiting for a about 20 minutes, we were seated. I had coffee and eggs benny. Food was delicious! Definitely recommend for brunch, but be sure to get there early to avoid waiting out in the cold. Service was good, and I loved the diner atmosphere. I felt like I took a step back in time in there, and I loved that feeling. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We go here maybe two or three times a year. As a young couple, we're about half the age of the average patron there so you sort of stick out. This place is a classier take on a diner and the service is very professional, however there was something off how they approached our table.

That being said, the food here is delicious. I had the short rib and my partner had the burger. The short rib was delicious, but the burger was absolutely mind blowing. They make it with fresh chuck so he chose to have it rare. So juicy, I can't even. I would absolutely love this place, but I think it's a bit pricey and the service is a bit off."}
{"text":"I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this is my first trip to the Senator. We tried on the weekend for brunch but it was lined up out the door. 

My server Shannon made all the difference in the world. I ordered the mac & cheese, and it arrived with a tasty side salad and a bit dry. I mentioned the dryness to Shannon and her solution turned my experience from a six out of 10 out of 10 in less than one minute flat!

Good food, great prices, and stellar service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great diner vibe downtown. A must visit for anyone with a craving for food a really good brunch."}
{"text":"Great food in  a Toronto landmark. It's a must go to. I had the turkey club which was amazing.."}
{"text":"Cozy diner with good food. Typical breakfast food with good flavor. I only give it four stars for the small size and unoriginal dishes. Nothing wrong with the place and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast! They didnt have ice coffee so the waiter made me some specially!"}
{"text":"I'm not the most demanding eater but the food was average at best. However, the coffee was AWFUL. I understand dark roast but this had been incinerated. It was nearly un-drinkable. I watched the other people around me and they had similar expressions. The wait staff was OK but unfocused. They gave our food away twice. If you're walking by, go in but I wouldn't wait in line. I'm shocked at the high reviews this place received."}
{"text":"This marked the first stop on Part 2 of the French Fry Crawl, and from a fry standpoint they were pretty good. Tasty, not overcooked, looked like real potatoes and not overly salty. One of the better examples, I'd say, that we experienced - maybe #3 out of the five.

The non-fry parts of the experience were much more difficult to swallow. As the place was packed - to the gills - we couldn't get a seat, and apparently ordering take-out was a non-starter with the gentleman taking our order (Waiter? Proprietor? Could've gone either way). We wound up with the plate of fries at the checkout counter basically, trying to eat with other people pushing past us trying in vain to get a table. One exchange was particularly interesting:

WOMAN WALKING IN: How long until I could get a seat to eat?
STAFF MEMBER: Probably not tonight
ME (thinking): Didn't he JUST tell us that it'd be an hour for us six?
GUY AT COUNTER: Actually, I'm just about done, I'll be out of here in a few minutes
STAFF MEMBER: Yeah, probably not tonight

(likely paraphrased due to the passage of time)

My other problem is the hours - wanting to maybe come back some other time, I had a glance at the hours. Being a guy coming out from Oakville, places that close early aren't compatible with me having a job.

Which is a shame, because any other option at Y&D is either disappointing, expensive or both."}
{"text":"Went here last saturday. 
Service is fast.... Busy place but didn't seem like people had to wait long.
Probably because the staff, though friendly, give you this sense of urgency to hurry up eat your food and get out!
It may not have been the case but it seemed like this to us... We were in the both near the front. Staff came by 3 times after the bill was given and one time to even reach across out table during our convo to \"straighten up\" the breakfast menus ....?!?
The food tasted good.... To start. Had the fresh squeezed oj and my friend liked their coffee. 
We shared the peameal bacon eggs Benedict and the spinach one. 
At first I loved the biscuit it was on, but after it seemed that the herb they put in it or was it onions ? Was a bit bitter. 
My friend enjoyed the spinach part but did not like the soggy biscuit. 
I thought the spinach - though I love sautéed spinach didn't mix with the herbed biscuit - could not finish it.
The waitress with long brown hair was constantly touching her hair or pushing it back then handling the food.... Maybe we wouldn't have scrutinized as much but she seemed in a rush so much that she placed my friends coffee on my friends cell phone ? There it sat on a tilt half on the table and on the phone --- which is black... The table is beige. Just saying.
She also refilled the good coffee almost spilling it on my friend.... It got all over the table. She did this pouring with one hand and trying to set two glasses of water down with the other. 
Who knows maybe she is new, maybe a bad day. Just a little too many strikes in one morning though. 
Was not a relaxing brunch to say the least. 
I think I will continue to try other brunch places for now instead of heading back here."}
{"text":"Maple Baked Beans for breakfast??!! Well when in Canada ....
The cafe was cozy,small,waiters friendly .had a breakfast plate served hot n fast..yum..however had ice tea and asked for a refill..well was charged for another 7 dollar tea. Whoops! Must go for a nice brunch taking ing the local fare in the city."}
{"text":"I was at the Senator Sept 20 2015 for Breakfast . I have been many times over the years I have to say it is ALWAYS my favorite breakfast place. 
 It is classic diner preserved pretty much to it's original look. You find 50's style bar stools at the bar, comfy booths, friendly service, and of course always fresh fantastic consistent food. AT the same time the are consistent to update menu items when it is needed. 
  I love the lattes. my personal favorites are
Eggs Popeye , eggs benedict on spinach with home fries. 
Fruit salad
Smoked Salmon platter, they smoke their own salmon
My favorite server is Brian 
No matter how busy they are service is always friendly and calm and believe me even on the coldest January 30 below Sunday they can still be lined up out the door. That is saying something."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. I was very impressed! Had the homemade granola with fresh berries, and the omelette with brie and lox. A+ food! Even the jam and toast were stellar. You can really taste the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Consistently good food! Great coffee & espresso bevs. Fresh ingredients. Try their blueberry pancakes - best I've had! (that includes mildred's temple kitchen blueberry pancakes!) Service is great, too. Only thing is the lineup - which can be about 15-20 mins - come early for best results :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, had a business lunch there a few moons back and selected the breakfast plate at lunch. Really good bacon, great toast and the eggs were cooked perfectly.

Recently enjoyed lunch there again, went with the cheeseburger, not the best I've ever had, but you could taste the bold made in house flavours in the meat and custom relish. JYB had the tuna melt and butternut squash soup. I don't do tuna, but it looked solid, and the soup was bold harvest flavours. 

Great spot for lunch in the downtown core. (looking forward to trying dinner there soon).

Additional Comments: Service was on point, very friendly."}
{"text":"Open since 1948,this little joint just steps from Yonge Dundas is a hidden gem of sorts. 

Came here on a Sunday for breakfast at 10:30 and there was a line out the door. We waited 10 mins and were seated at the bar. 

We were greeted immediately and offered coffee and juice. Perfect after a night out drinking. 

The food was flavourful and plentiful. The staff insanely polite and the overall feeling of the place was great!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I've done an event with The Senator, so I might be slightly biased. However, this place is an institution and I'm there often, and frankly I can't believe I've never reviewed it. 

The Senator really is proof that Diner doesn't have to be a dirty word, and if you're downtown and you go to Fran's instead of here I've lost all respect for you. Like, never talk to me again if that's the case. 

This is Toronto's oldest restaurant and they do scratch comfort food extremely well. Big booths, free wifi and they bring the heat with their milkshakes. 

I really heart their chicken club, it's piled it high with a full chicken breast. Can't beat that. Be sure to add cheese, as everything is better with cheese. 

PEPPER POINTS for upping their coffee game. I just drink the stuff to caffeinate, but if you're a coffee snob you will be impressed."}
{"text":"I had the Huevos Rancheros or something like that and it was pretty decent.  When my waitress asked me how I wanted my eggs done, I said poached?  And she said no problem.  I was impressed.  The poached egg was perfect, except I caught a bit of egg shell.

The corizo sausage was good but not spicy enough for my taste.  The corn bread was good but not sweet enough but that is ok.  The beans were cooled perfectly but lacked seasoning.  So I asked for tobasco sauce but it never came.  I also had earls grey tea and I opeded the teapot head requesting more hot water to be filled and it wasn't till I finished my breakfast thay another waitress walked by asking if I wanted more water and I said yes.

This place has a nice decor with homy feel and I can tell the food is well prepared in general but wasn't outstanding overall.  I think what is popular is the senator special which is basically full farmers breakfast with tea under $8."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch. Quiet on weekdays, unique menu options (eggs benedict on a biscuit), quality ingredients."}
{"text":"We walked for an hour looking for a nice breakfast place in downtown Toronto until we stumbled upon this little gem.

Walking in is like walking into the typical diner you'd see on TV, it is so cute.  
The get their milk from a special dairy farm and it is delicious.
Their coffee is specialty brewed as well.

Standard breakfast fare, but in a cool, hipster setting with some unique touches."}
{"text":"One of my favourite diners in the core. Friendly service (most days) and the standard breakfast is hearty and delicious.  Decor and atmosphere are both great.  Can be a bit loud at times."}
{"text":"Very cool old place with a classic diner feel.  Great for breakfast or a beer after work.  Eggs Benedict is a winner here for sure!"}
{"text":"A pretty standard place to go for breakfast.  I stopped by because I was just around the corner and needed to eat something really fast.  I got some sausage and eggs with toast.  Nothing special but the service was fast and they waitress was super nice.  A cute little place too!  I think when I went they were just about to go under renovation so I'm sure some of the decor may have changed.  Overall, great place for breakfast with big portion sizes."}
{"text":"So we started our first day in Toronto with a bit of Yelping and a slice of home in this cozy little diner. My wife and I love to frequent a little diner just around the corner form our home, and enjoy that simple, home cooked and cared for feel that they have.  The Senator didn't disappoint.  

Across a few streets from the Eaaton Center, this little gem was less Crowded than I expected on a Saturday morning.  The cozy booths, the wood and simple decor, made this place seem very unassuming and welcoming.  We were seated instantly, which was great, and provided with two deliciously piping hot cups of coffee, which was wonderful.   A bit of a coffee snob, it was a pleasant medium roast that was quite delicious.  

Liz ordered the Senator Special which includes two eggs, two pieces of bacon, home fries and challa toast...the toast came with delicious fresh raspberry jam...wonderful!  The platter did come with pork beans, which was a pleasantly different planting, but appreciated by my protein hungry and pregnant wife.  I  decided on the huevos rancheros which were awesome.  The avocado, fresh salsa and delicious black brand were rich textures against the eggs over medium and corn bread.  Normally a sweet corn bread fan, this was more on the savory side which was welcome against the cumin and sweet favors of the beans.  

It was wonderful.  No rush to shove us our,  we were able to finish our breakfast, our conversation, and get on our way back to our hotel...just in time to consult Yelp on our lunch and dinner plans!"}
