{"text":"It is so nice to have a neighborhood soup , salad, panini place. Everything we tried was amazing. This is a very nice addition to our neighborhood. Support a great family owned business."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I had an Italian panini sandwich, the meat was great and the bread was fresh and flaky.  I also had the chicken lemon rice soup. It was killer, the owners had to be from the Midwest because I have not had soup like that since i was in Michigan. The location is a bit hard to find, but this place is truly a hidden gem. It looks like your regular run of the mill coffee/sandwich place but i was extremely surprised at how good the food and the services were."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been great!  Tuna sandwich, jello, desserts, salads.."}
{"text":"Eat here almost every day. Love the London Broil, Veggie Quesadilla, all of the salads."}
{"text":"The staff is always amazing, customer service like no other, they will make any item you ask for, even if it's not on the menu. The food is so so good and better than any of the restaurants I've tried out around here. Portions are very filling, I sometimes have leftovers. I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Apart from the 21 year old by the register sprucing up her lips with extra thick extra shiny and dazzling lip gloss...and not saying HI...I'd give this place a solid 10. Not sure who owns the place but the Chipotle panini and Italian are bar none the best....
Sour cream pound cake and lemon are bigger (portion wise) better and less expensive than the Starbucks comparison...
it's a neat spot.

They open at 7am and close at 4pm Monday through Friday to support the office complex....try it!! You won't be disappointed. 

She ended up throwing the extra slice of cake...after I got four slices...

Yes she made up for it and I have em a five...bloody lips"}
{"text":"I work in the building where this place is which makes it very hard to resist the Everything Cookie! Hands down my all time favorite and goes great with their variety of ice teas, no sugar of course. If could, I would probably eat one just about everyday, and order three on Friday so I have the weekend covered. Another of my favorites is the Chicken Chipotle really good and priced fairly. If you are ever in the area or visit the office, give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that I stumbled upon this place online!  I've been desperately seeking a close, reasonably priced lunch spot that has healthy options.  Panini Bread & Grill fits the bill perfectly!  I ordered the harvest chicken salad and it was wonderful.  The portion is huge and it had lots of tasty toppings.  I substituted the raspberry vinaigrette for for balsamic, but only because I was concerned that it would be too sweet with all the fruit that came with the salad.  If that doesn't bother you, I'm sure it would be delicious as is!  Oh, and they have Passport tea, which I was very excited about!  They had lots of other items that sounded great...I can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, clean and new, good prices, tables to sit at, always clean. Love the coffee! Espresso, cappuccino. Desserts, salads several drink choices just great!

The offer soup, sandwiches, salads, protein shakes. Snacks are all healthy options such as boiled eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese or you can choose bakery items or candy."}
{"text":"I will admit I was a little apprehensive about visiting Panini Bread and Grill when I found it doing a cursory search for \"food\" in my zip code. I found them listed on Google Maps and while there were no reviews listed there, I decided to look them up on Yelp and see what I found. When I discovered nothing but perfect ratings (excluding one 4 star review), my apprehension level rose just a bit seeing as some companies will pay people to write good reviews to drum up business for an otherwise craptastic business. But nonetheless I decided to give it a go and try this little unassuming café a go. 

Parking was pretty easy as there are several spots for visitors with a two hour limit, which made getting inside a breeze. 

The café itself is tucked away beyond the stairs and elevators of the building and is far cleaner than most restaurants that I have been to, even chain ones with corporate standards. The menu is simple enough and the prices more than reasonable. The food itself is delicious and fresh and I was helped as soon as I walked through the door. While waiting for my food a few more people came through and any time that the line became more than 1 person long a second cashier came up to take orders. 

My only gripe is that the woman that rang me up made no attempt at upselling. I was kind of eyeing the desert case and was not really given the opening to ask about anything in the case. The ordering process was a very stiff \"what can I get you, here are our sides,  here's your total, sign here\". While yes I understand that if I wanted something I should just order it and that lunch is not always the best time to upsell on desert items, it takes less than five seconds to pitch a brownie or cookie. 

I am happy to say that all of the positive reviews found on here are no doubt accurate and not some advertisement or marketing company."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The Monterrey was spectacular! Everything from the pasta salad to the potato skin chips was delicious. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Oh, and the delivery guy is adorable!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! They serve fresh and delicious lunch for reasonable price. What more can you ask for? On my first trip to PBG I ordered a portobello panini and was soooooo gooood! They had so many different options and can't wait to try other goodness soon."}
{"text":"This place is great. I eat lunch here almost every day and I don't get tired of it. Everything is super fresh and tasty. The menu selection is really good. There's a little bit of everything. The chocolate chip cookies are huge and so soft! The Thai chicken salad is really good too."}
{"text":"Amazing! Owners are personable and very involved in their business, they make sure that their customers are happy to the fullest. They have a huge menu with lots to choose from, everything from drinks, salads, sandwiches, baked goods... everyone can find something. I had their chicken Chipotle sandwhich, I wasn't even that hungry when I ordered amd ended up eating the whole thing! The bread was fresh and the perfect thickness, chicken was nicely baked and didn't taste processed, the cheese was thick and perfectly melted and the sauce topped it off. Will Definetly recommend!! And they have multiple locations."}
