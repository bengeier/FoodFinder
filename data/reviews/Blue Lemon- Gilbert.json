{"text":"Saw this place driving by. Not sure how long they've been open. Checked the reviews just as I was sitting down after ordering. 

4 parties including myself in here at 6 pm .. pretty empty for the size of the place.

I ordered the balsamic chicken pannini. Very flavorful and fresh ingredients. 

They did a beautiful job building the restaurant and using modern design touches. 

Not quite sure what's missing, why this place is not busier and why some of the bad reviews.  I was pleased and will be back to try it again. Hope they can make it.. you can tell a sizeable investment was made in this place.

Food is a little pricey for the serving size but it was very good. If they can figure out what is missing to make it a popular spot, I don't think the pricing is too out of line. One look at Joe's a couple miles south of here will confirm that."}
{"text":"Entire family has food poisoning.  We picked up dinner to go at around 430.  Everyone was violently ill by 9pm.  We ordered the beef tacos, mac and cheese for the kids, and artichoke dip.  I dont know why it is that hard to do the one thing you suppose to be good at, make food.  No thanks again."}
{"text":"Too much attention paid towards the decor and environment and not enough attention towards the food. Overpriced and mediocre at best. Can a girl just have the freedom to choose how much syrup goes on her pancakes?! You don't know me blue lemon."}
{"text":"Nice healthy option in the area. A little expensive for what you get, but the food is pretty good and they're pretty quick with takeout.

I had the a Mango Mint Chicken Salad the first time I got takeout here, and it was awesome. Very tasty and fairly large portion size. 

The second time I ate here, I ate in and got a turkey sandwich with some sort of cranberry sauce. Pretty tasty, but far too expensive for my portion size and good, but not great, turkey."}
{"text":"For a \"clean\" restaurant they sure cut corners and give you nasty food. I ordered the mango mint salad and it was supposed to have grilled chicken and sweet onions, yet the meat looked like cheap cold cuts and the onions looked like they came from a jar. The \"grilled\" chicken was literally cold cuts. The avocado looked like it has been sitting out all day. Needless to say, I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Was excited about a new restaurant in gilbert close to home.  I have been to breakfast here three times lunch twice and will not be returning. Service is non existent. Food is mediocre at best. Real could be a hit if they got some management that was actually on site. I have only ever saw very young staff with no guidance and no service skills. Tragic to have a new restaurant start out this way."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the US 60. It is a nice clean, open, modern restaurant and the staff has been friendly both times we went. The food does taste fresh but the portions are small. The steak tacos were really good. I got them with corn tortillas even though they normally come with flour. The guacamole was good but the salsa was very plain. The second time I got the BBQ brisket sandwich which was okay. The meet was a little tough but the bread was amazing. Both times we have been the place has been pretty empty. On the flipside the food does come out fast. I also tried the german chocolate cake bites which were very good. I will go back, assuming they can stay open. Hopeful they can cover the rent payment on such a large place with the foot traffic they are getting."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had an option for ZERO stars. This place should be called RANCID LEMON!"}
{"text":"Been back here for lunch a half dozen times now and the food is great every time! I do recommend Blue Lemon to anyone, the ambiance is great, staff is friendly,  food is delicious...."}
{"text":"I find the menu to be good, but the service is slow and as I sit here an hour before they close they are putting up all the unused chairs to sweep the floors. This definitely sends the message I should leave, so I will."}
{"text":"The tomato soup is so good.  The hummus and vegetable platter is great....the hummus is fresh.  They also make a blueberry lemonade.  Their artichoke chicken dish is incredible.  The portions are just right. Super healthy food for clean eating."}
{"text":"I want to rate this highly because the food is AMAZING. Especially the breakfast, the crepes have such a unique flavor. 
However, I'm giving Blue Lemon two stars because the service there is horrible. I went for breakfast with my boyfriend last Sunday and I think that I will not return there. 
Our food was brought out fairly promptly but we had to ask them for the coffees we had ordered (and payed for in advance). Despite the fact that the restaurant was fairly empty, our server rarely checked on us and we had finished our meal before he came back again and we had to ask again for our coffees. A few minutes later we asked another server, since our previous one had disappeared. He left and came back with a young man who seemed to be a manager, who, without apologizing for the delay, asked us to repeat our order, while collectively referring to my boyfriend as ladies. After that, our coffee still didn't arrive so we asked another young man and he actually brought back my boy friends coffee, but mine never made an appearance because upon realizing that our first coffee was horribly burnt, we left. 

Very frustrating! I probably won't return- despite the beautiful crepes. :("}
{"text":"I don't know why I decided to give this place more chances. I came in tonight and got steak lettuce wraps, it was the special and recommended by staff. I have to say I am not impressed, I barely ate half of them. The meat does not even taste like steak and I was given 4 small pieces of lettuce, not worth $11.00. Now I am sure I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Their butternut soup is out of this world, almost more of a dessert. I have never had warm hummus before but it is truly delicious. I love the salmon, steak, Black and blue burger, and even the kids meals are delicious!"}
{"text":"While visiting my son in Utah, he took me to the Blue Lemon for lunch. What a very nice surprise this restaurant is! I was super excited when I discovered that they opened one here in Arizona!  Don't let the ordering at the counter fool you.  Yes, it may be a fast casual restaurant, but, the food is upscale and very affordable.  At the Utah location I had the Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs ($11.50).  The beef was tender and the fingerling potatoes carrots and asparagus with cooked perfectly.  At the Gilbert location, I had the Artichoke and Tomato Chicken.  It was delicious!  Chicken was moist and tender and was also served with fingerling potaotes. Along with the potatoes, were fire roasted artichoke hearts and tomatoes, saute√©d spinach and a roasted red pepper cream sauce. This too was delicious!  I was blown away with presentation at both locations. You would expect this quality of food and presentation at an upscale restaurant and pay a lot more for it!"}
{"text":"Go to Pita Jungle if you want really good healthy food at a reasonable price. This place does not deliver. This place claims to be healthy but they seem to be extremely heavy on the butter. Even though they clearly pre-make some of their \"fresh\" food service is sloooowww. I tried to find something positive to say but I couldn't find anything."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here & not very impressed with the food. I had the crepes & they were pretty bland albeit simple in its ingredients. There was no one in the restaurant on a Sunday morning! A little weird."}
{"text":"The idea of the place is awesome. Healthy fresh food with plenty of options for vegetarians.  I can say a few good things about Blue Lemon. The restaurant was clean. The food was plated well. The plates you see on the website are exactly as beautiful as what they serve. The staff was friendly.

My wife and I ordered beers,  a hummus appetizer, and then each a sandwich with sweet potato fries. The hummus board came out promptly with our drinks. But less than a minute later, out came our fries. I never thought I'd complain about food being served too quickly, but after just a couple more minutes, out came our sandwiches. If the food had tasted great, I wouldn't be complaining, but now I'm wondering: can gourmet flavour really be done that quickly?

There's also the flow of dinner. I was expecting the usual concept of appetizers followed by a meal. Instead it felt more like stopping in for fast food. This is purely about mis-matched expectations. Next time, I'll order a coke instead of a beer.

So here's the reason for the low rating: nothing tasted bad; nearly everything tasted bland.

The chipotle pineapple bbq sandwich was particularly disappointing. The beef did have a sauce; perhaps simple syrup thickened with corn starch. There was certainly no trace of peppers, smoked or otherwise. Pineapple was curiously missing, along with any other flavour besides basic sweetness. The rest of the sandwich couldn't make up for the lack of chipotle, pineapple, and bbq.

The grilled balsamic chicken panini was okay. According to the menu description, I should have been tasting a balsamic glaze, red onions, garlic, and a lemon pesto aioli. The \"aioli\" turned out to be a thin bit of mayonnaise, without even green food colouring to make up for the lack of pesto. The chicken was seasoned nicely, but somewhat dry, and I'm not sure what happened to the balsamic glaze.

The fries weren't hot or crisp enough to have been fresh out of either a fryer or oven. The sauce they came with was okay though. The hummus... it wasn't bad, just seemed to be missing something. I've had better from the various greek and turkish places around town."}
{"text":"Went here just after they opened up. I was really hungry when I came here so I wasn't too picky but in hindsight I wanted the food to be better.  The food took forever to get to us. My fries were under cooked.  Turkey bacon was limp and so were the greens in my husband's salad.  The food didn't taste bad really just a little below average but I like the concept and decor as well as the menu choices so hopefully they get their act together.  I might give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Excellent FOOD AND SERVICE! We have been here a number of times and it is always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this new restaurant. I expected something else so I was disappointed. I don't want to go to a store where I have to order at the cash register. Mostly, I was disappointed in the tomato artichoke panini. This place advertises pure, fresh new approaches to food. This sandwich used artichokes from a bottle and most disappointing, those dried tomatoes. It's August. Use some juicy real tomatoes. The concept was intriguing, yes,but the product lacked . The Frizzie drink was overpoweringly sweet. The young staff served adequately; the atmosphere was industrial."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place, Food was too fancy, had no flavor in the chicken or steak tacos not impressed!"}
{"text":"The food was great and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich and I will definitely go back again to order that! The side potatoes weren't great, I ended up ordering another side because I really didn't like them. The employees were all nice and professional. The manager was kind of rude and snappy--she kept barking at the workers and ordering them around. But overall good experience!"}
{"text":"I received a gift card to Blue Lemon (love their food!) and they closed 7 days later before I could use it. Why sell a gift card if you're going to close? Doesn't make sense"}
{"text":"By far the worst breakfast we have ever had. Here are the highlights...
Negatives:
- they only had 3 breakfast menus at the cashier, so everyone had to every take turns looking at it before they could order
- brought out our meals one at a time, with minutes in between
- they forgot one of our meals and we had to ask for it three times
- one order of pancakes had raw batter in the centers!
- eggs had no seasonings
- eggs florentine had completely hard cooked eggs on top
- eggs that were supposed to be over-medium were fried to a crisp
- cold, bland hollandaise sauce
- the kids meal came out last and they got our order wrong. we ordered a french toast and they brought out pancakes after every adult had already gotten their meal
- no consistency: some of our potatoes were burnt, the others were basically still raw
- the kids pancakes were twice as big as the adult pancakes
- small portions for the price

Positives:
- the Banana Foster french toast was good, but could use some more sliced bananas
- the pancakes that were cooked were good, but not enough syrup

We are not the type to complain, but we felt they should know about our experience. When we spoke to the manager, she just gave us a blank stare and said that they're working on it. Then they proceeded to stare us down as we left the restaurant. 
We were the largest party (8 people) in the restaurant and received the worst service. They were not busy by any means, so I'm sure if we went when it was busier the experience would have been even worse.
We are all big fans of the Blue Lemon in Utah but needless to say, we won't be going back to the Gilbert location. They need to stop serving breakfast and stick with lunch & dinner. Their menu sounds great, but their breakfast is terrible. Go to Kneaders down the street instead."}
{"text":"It was terrible! I got cold food and I was the only one there! Toast was hard and cold. My tiny eggs were over cooked and that was the only thing they actually cooked. Its pretty but a lemon!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Service is poor. Bad food and no twist. Dont waste your money and time here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I've tried has been so good. Don't expect traditional recipes, however. Read the descriptions! The food is really unique and yummy! Because everything is healthy, portion sizes are smaller - but it's really filling. I love that there is a fresh and healthy option for eating out in our area. It's a super cute family environment that we all enjoy. My picky eater kids love the Mac and cheese and I don't feel guilty letting them get it because I know the ingredients are fresh and it's made with good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. It was quiet enough to hear each speak which was lovely. I ordered the salmon which was delightful, the rice was a bit dry. And my other half ordered a steak which he says was pretty good. It was a little pricier than we were expecting, but good none the less. We will probably come back."}
{"text":"I am glad I didn't read the other reviews before deciding to stop here! The service was friendly and prompt when I went there on a Saturday afternoon. There were a handful of other patrons, but it was by no means busy. You order at the counter and get your own drink, then a server will bring you your food. I ordered an Avocado and Turkey sandwich on cibatta bread, and my order was delivered in good time. The food was good, but could have been a bit better--certainly nothing to complain about. I would have used avocado slices instead of a spread, but that is just my personal taste. No one came to check on how I was doing after the food was dropped off. I felt that the cost of meal was on the high side for a place that doesn't really have waiters so much as delivery people (about $10-$12 bucks for most sandwiches, and it didn't come with any sides or garnish of any kind), but I didn't feel completely cheated, either."}
{"text":"I was working the late shift and ordered the slow braised beef short ribs served with fingerling potatoes and carrots. I got the food back to work,  opened the container. What I received was roast beef over little dried up potatoes. I was a bit upset already having braised short ribs on my mind so I called to speak with the manager. When the manager got on the phone she explained to me that's how they serve their short ribs. I was speechless. She offered to take my name and give me a free meal but I declined. I ate the \"short ribs\"(roast beef) and potatoes. The roast beef was ok. It was like what I make at home in the crock pot. The potatoes tasted like they were 3 days old. They were probably frozen and reheated. So....if you like pot roast you should order the slow braised beef short ribs."}
{"text":"Not the best first impression! 
I just moved to the East Valley & drive by Blue Lemon daily to/from work. I was very excited to try the healthy options take that Blue Lemon totes. 

The atmosphere is very nice & decor contemporary cute! It was a little cold inside but in AZ hard to complain about that. 

I popped in and decided to get my order to-go. I ordered Seared Tuna Entr√©e with side spinach salad.
It wasn't busy but I waited 30 min for my order! There were probably 2-3 other tables seated. During the 30 min I waited I was brought 2 other orders that weren't mine. Then a server? came over and asked what I had ordered. The kitchen is an open concept & faces the dining room and there were 3 staff members standing in the kitchen talking while I sat and waited. As I got up to go see what could be taking so long to sear tuna, my order was ready. The young man who delivered it said \"sorry\" I commented \"yeah 30 min!\" No attempt to make it right & regain my business. 

The food was tasty but small portions for the price. The rice/veggies were a little oily?

I'd like to try Blue Lemon again but not sure based on other reviews it's worth it."}
{"text":"Honestly, VERY disappointing. Sandwich was soft and tasteless. We were with a party of six and no one was satisfied with their meal."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time tonight.  The food was great.  The butternut squash soup was delicious.  I wouldn't mind having it daily.  The bread that came with it had a weird texture so I didn't eat it.  I also got the chicken balsamic panini which was nice and flavorful.  The drink dispensers are pretty cool.  A lot of tables around us got some amazing looking food that I'll be trying on the next trip.

While the food was good,I'm not a fan of waiting in line to order my food, especially dinner.  The girl taking my order seemed more concerned about giving me a number than answering my questions or placing my order.  I went with two friends and they brought our orders out at different times resulting in about 8 trips to our table to bring food that could have been done in two and later they kept coming by to clear which made me feel like they were trying to get us to leave even though there were open tables.

I'd definitely prefer this place for a quick lunch or takeout and wouldn't recommend it for a long catch up dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out with my family since there aren't too many healthy food restaurants in the area. Service was blah.... I ordered the fish tacos with corn tortillas... please don't order this! First the tortillas were so stiff on my plate that they were already broken up. I have eaten better tortillas at Walmart!  I ask someone for new tortillas and they brought out the same type, hard, broken and difficult to eat. I will not return I ordered 1 glass of wine, fish tacos which I ended up eating probably 1 taco it came with nothing else I spent $21.00. No thanks not worth it. Sorry don't waste your time. I would rather go to Pita Jungle!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, it seems like they are trying to be modern with the environment. I didn't enjoy the food much, the food has that look where you think, \"ooo high end delicious food\" but it's basic.  Wasn't impressed by any means. I drive past this place every day, it's a hit and miss, sometimes there is a lot of people, some times not.

Usually not."}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret!  Have been here several times and the seared salmon is excellent. I also love the artichoke sandwich with chicken. Register line is a little slow when busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great shrimp tacos with mango salsa. Light, fresh and quick. My sister loved her short ribs and veggies. Can't wait to go back and try another entree. Loved this choices for drinks."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot. We're lucky to have in the east valley yet alone in Arizona. I give it a five star because the food is excellent and the decore is modern and comfortable. The concept is fresh and unique and wondefully exicuted. My only critique would be, the staff seems to be either and little uptight and reserved or timid and awkward. You guys have an awesome place. Drop the tude and be chill. I will definitely regular either way."}
{"text":"Website hours don't match the actual store hours. Call before you go to make sure they are even open. 2nd visit and 2nd disappointment."}
{"text":"You've got to try the butternut squash soup it's to die for! I also really enjoyed the fish tacos! The staff is always friendly and helpful, the food is ready fairly quick, prices are reasonable, and the decor is adorable!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review a few months ago and only gave them 2 stars. Since then, they've changed management and this place has done a complete 180!!! WOW am I ever impressed! The service used to be detached and slow, and it took forEVER to even get a drink. Well, the food is still amazing and healthy, but now the associates are energetic and outgoing, I got my food insanely quickly, and I even got checked on twice. I'm bringing my fiance back on Sunday and my best friend back this week. I'm so glad this place is back at the top of our list. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Simply put, Yuk. Had many hopes for this concept. One or two decent selections but otherwise not very good. Too bad as I was excited when they first opened . Tried it twice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is just fantastic, the colors are so different they make you feel like your in a high end restraint but its so clean. I went for the breakfast and I get the pancakes every time, their lemon maple syrup is just to die for, definitely worth every second."}
{"text":"Did not like it :(  I really wanted to.  It had a weird smell when we walked in.  The cashier was super nice and helpful and the set up was really cute, but the food...mine was so bad.  I got the turkey avacado and I haaatted it.  Probably one of the worst things I've eaten-I should have said something.  The bottom side of each half of my sandwich was SOPPING, and the turkey tasted really old.  Also really pricey, $27 for mine and my husband's food and he got two small tacos.  He said his guac tasted like  Play Doh.  Won't be back...wish it was better."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business this week. When I travel I'm always looking for new foods and restaurants. The menu delivered to my office appeared very professional and elegant, good sounded good. I ordered the Artichoke & Tomato Chicken: Iron seared natural chicken breast topped with fire roasted artichoke hearts and tomatoes served with roasted fingerling potatoes saut√©ed spinach and roasted red pepper cream sauce. 

The dish had good appearance like the menu but the quality stopped there. Chicken was over cooked, potatoes as well. The sauces helped add some flavor but could not rehydrate the chicken. Tapatio sauce was called in to help me enjoy the meal. I gave blue lemon 1 star for customer service which I'm finding rare here and 1 star for presentation. That is all."}
{"text":"We've been at the Blue Lemon twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. We won't be hurrying back. The food was delivered before we were settled in our chairs. Not once did the server come back to our table. The food was good though.
As for the operation of the restaurant itself I give it a failing grade. That is the lack of training from ownership and management."}
{"text":"Very different from the original one in Utah. The food is trying to be original but can sometimes be over plated, flavored and priced. It also claims that it uses modern food with a clean twist. But it just seems like it's frozen pasta dish with a fancy sauce drizzled around it."}
{"text":"This place makes good food. However, the service has gone from bad to worse. I always have to order food for my boss here so I get to to-go a lot. Most of the time, I go to the to go area and get ignored for at least five minutes, watching employees just walk around. They're never busy when I'm there. I've never bothered to complain, just because I don't care enough to usually. But the last time I went (today) I was treated awful from the moment I walked in. The girl at the front counter treated me like I was her worst enemy and I have no idea what I did to cause it - I was just going there to pick up my food and leave. I did have to change something on my receipt but that took her 30 seconds to change for me- it made her visibly angry at me though (more than when I first walked in.) just overall icy, rude, hateful behavior and I'm puzzled about it. Needless to say I will not be back for my own meals. No food is good enough for me to go back and get treated like I ruined someone's life just for showing up."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Bluelemon tonight based on a write up in a recent AZ Republic article.  Beautiful dining room and very nice staff.  

The issues, all the food arrived with in 30 seconds of each other.  We ordered an appetizer, Mushroom and Feta Flatbread, but it arrived at our table after our soup and salad.  This forced us to rush through the soup and salad before we got started on the appetizer, which then was cold.  The flatbread appetizer was not made very well.  Some slices of the flatbread had the mushrooms and feta and other slices had nothing on it.  Then our sandwich and entr√©e arrived.  Our table was full of food before we even had time to finish one item.  It was overwhelming and by the time we got to the sandwich and entree it was cold.  Also, since you pay up front, when you walk in, getting a second beer is not offered.  All this for $42, too expensive.

After walking into a beautiful dining room and being greeted by a very nice \"cashier\", it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy with my meal at blue lemon. Initial impression when looking at the place I was impressed and looking over the menu I was expecting more but I was let down big time. I got the bbq pull pork and it was literally a meat paste the was thinner that the slice of cheese. There isn't anything on the blue lemon menu that you can't get somewhere else and done better. Take an extra 10 minutes and drive to Paradise Bakery or Jason's Deli. Don't waste your hard earned money."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we're very impressed. Nice hipster style deco, nice staff with fast service. One thing I'm not a big fan of is the flat screen menus that are constantly changing but they have printed menus to save the day! I had the Artichoke tomato chicken that was Paleo delicious! My wife had oriental salad which she also loved, both entr√©es were high quality food with a nice presentation. It also has a very nice outdoor seating  with radiant heaters for the cool months and shaded area with misters for the hot months. I would love to go for breakfast if they didn't open so late. I'll never understand why all the greasy spoons open at the crack of dawn but my preference of healthy places open so late."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the brisket, it was greasy ugh. The service was great but the food was disappointing.  I recommend a salad, they looked better than what I got."}
{"text":"So, I am not quite sure how many stars to give this Blue Lemon. I have been here before and was very happy. But this time I ordered the oriental salad and a bowl of the butternut squash soup. I should not have assumed, I guess, that the ginger dressing would be sweet as it is in every other restaurant I have ordered from. Therefore the salad was completely bland. I could have just eaten wet grass and gotten the same experience. No seasoning on the chicken, although it was very tender. Now, I am from Utah where Blue Lemon was born. One of my boys interned there during culinary school. So I know that the soup I got in Gilbert, is not the same soup that is served in Utah. I know exactly what is suppose to be in this soup! Gilbert patrons are getting ripped off. Here, it was a runny mess. Too bad, because I crave this sweet goodness often. I guess I will have to make it myself. Don't skip this place, just don't get this soup or salad. I was disappointed with my $16 choice today."}
{"text":"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. the roasted beet salad with chicken. It's beautiful and delicious. ..the perfect end to a rough day!"}
{"text":"Very nice presentation and plating. High end tasting food at about 10 per plate. Relaxed atmosphere, great soda machines and very clean feeling. It's worth the trip. Only complaint is a slow line to order and the digital menus are small print and hard to read. Great place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  Delicious food. Fast, attentive service. Loved that they offered stevia as a choice for my ice tea. They also had a gender reveal party going on that was so cute to watch. They let the customers decorate part of the restaurant just for that purpose. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We come here at least twice a week. The food is fresh and has gluten free options. Can order to go as well and the portions are nice size. We like the pear and Gorgonzola salad, sweet potato fries, squash soup, and steak salad. Sometimes the line is long but they get to you fairly fast. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today!  The customer service was excellent. The staff seemed friendly and glad to be there. The space is open, airy, light, and clean!  The food was delicious. I got the artichoke and tomato chicken!  MMmmmmm!  Also tried the garlic hummus and spinach artichoke dips. Both come with hot seasoned pita bread and fresh crisp veggies. The hummus & dip didn't taste familiar but were nice. They play great music, I see a lot of computers here...so maybe wifi. 

You order when you walk in and then they give you a pager. Sit down and your food comes Quick and with a smile. No waitress type service. (why add a tip line on receipt?)  You Get your drinks. If you need, you Go ask for your to go container.  Which is fine. $20. Pricey for a lunch and no drink but very good. I'll go there again!  The grilled chicken was moist and seasoned beautifully!  

Not sure if I was supposed to take my dishes away like at Panera Bread, but when I pay $20 for a meal, I don't do dishes. (Add tip line is on the ticket, so I did prior to seeing the trash cans)"}
{"text":"Always good food and a little out of the ordinary from the menu most restaurants offer. They also have some good healthy choices available."}
{"text":"The Grilled Balsamic Chicken Panini was amazing.  I would definitely get that again.  I really liked how the dining area was decorated.  The kitchen has big glass windows so you can see them cooking your food.  The kitchen looked clean and organized.  The staff was very friendly as well.  I also like that you order at the counter and then they bring you your food.  Overall, the experience was very good and I will return."}
{"text":"This is such a great place. I love the decor and everything I have ever ordered here has been very tast\y and the portions are big."}
{"text":"We loved our experience at Blue Lemon. The service was swift and courteous, and the food delicious. Husband had the butternut squash soup and Southwest flat bread, both outstanding. I had the Chinese salad and I would definitely get it again. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time at the Blue Lemon. Good service and nice atmosphere but high prices for what you get. I had the black bean ravioli that would have been better with a different sauce. It was a little bitter. My wife had a blue cheese burger that was just ok for $9. We will probably try the Blue Lemon again but won't have the ravioli and burger again."}
{"text":"Wow, I am so glad I did not look at the reviews before trying this place! A friend recommended Blue Lemon.  My daughter and I tried it for lunch today and we loved it. 

The greeters are super friendly.  We ordered the artichoke and tomato chicken and the iron seared salmon.  The chicken was slightly dry, but I think that also has to do with the fact that I am not a fan of white meat chicken.  I love dark meat.  I know white is better, but most restaurants make it sort of dry, according to my standards.  So based on my opinion, they make white meat chicken like other restaurants.  

The rest of the food was absolute perfection.  The salmon was AMAZING. Can't wait to order that again!  The veggies, sauces over and around the food, potatoes, green tea, chai, were all made full of flavor and super healthy.  I think we have found a new fave!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Staff was helpful and extremely friendly! Local beers on draft."}
{"text":"Oh Utah chains, you have managed to disappoint me again. I ordered takeout from blue lemon last night since it is close to work, and it's hard to find vegetarian fare in our cafeteria. Getting takeout is confusing because there is no separate line or register. I went on a busy Friday night so I proceeded to the espresso bar to skip the line.

The girl working was the one who had taken my order. I followed her over to the area where they were expediting food only to find out that my order had never crossed over to the kitchen. She told me it would only take a couple minutes for it to be ready. I explained I was on a break from work, and it needed to be done as quickly as possible.

I waited 10 minutes more for my order. When someone finally handed me a bag, he asked \"is this your order?\" I asked, \"is that the black bean ravioli?\" He answered, \"I think so.\" Exasperated, I opened up my to-go box, and he said \"Is that right?\" I don't understand how he didn't know what the dish was supposed to look like. No one was remotely apologetic about the delay. 

The ravioli tasted okay, but they didn't saut√© the vegetables properly because it was made so quickly. After a while, all I could taste was raw spinach and onions. It took a lot of breath mints to get the taste out of my mouth.

Poor service and poor food means they won't be getting a second chance from me."}
{"text":"Adandoned Restaurant!

First time to the Bluelemon, kinda dissapointed with the operations. I prefer not to write poor reviews but as you'll see this place is struggling.

The operation style is someplace between Casual Dining and Fast food. No hosted seating and no table service (sorta). Order your food at a counter and get a numbered pager (for the bussers, not to be paged). The bussers/ servers just deliver the food and vanish. No drink refills, no water, no interaction after food delivery and not a word about dessert. You need to plan ahead if you want dessert and order it when you order your food. (I bet they sell almost no dessert) They do have a cool new self serve soda machine with hundreds of choices.

We picked the BlueLemon from the coupons in the weekly mailer ValPak. The cashier failed to give us the price reduction and then the cashier had to get help correcting it. Oh, don't want to forget this:
Cashier had no idea how to change the paper in the receipt printer, and the helper didn't show how to change it. So, this problem will happen again, hope it doesn't happen to you. Let's not forget how insanely simple it is to change the paper, literally push a button, pull out the old paper roll center and drop the new paper in and close the door!! 

Ok, I'm using the word 'Helper' because this restaurant has been abandoned by management. The 'Manager' is working as the expediter (epic fail, waited 30 minutes for our food), and there is no one performing customer service or checking on the customers. Nothing! No interaction with the customers after they sit down. Just a busser dropping the food and later asking if the food was good.

Food: My son ate his Tenders and he liked them. My friend had the days special chicken, it was 'Ok' but dry, probably will not be a returning special. I had the short ribs, served on fingerling potatoes with an ok gravy, and two baby carrots. The ribs were cook well and I'd consider trying it again. (The old Olive Garden short ribs were better).

We had the Artichoke, spinach cheese dip with flat bread. It was crazy good!! Really was the high point of the meal. Flat bread was really good and explains why all the appetizers are with flatbread.

Don't expect much service and if you don't get your food in a few minutes you'll have to send up a flare!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the staff was very friendly, especially Chandler!  We are going back to try breakfast, we just wished they had mimosas."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but definitely a lack is customer service. I went through an entire breakfast meal before receiving my coffee, which was cold when finally delivered. I do believe it will get better with time, but they need to invest in some quality service training and attentiveness."}
{"text":"Yelp doesnt lie.  We tried about 5 different dishes here, and all were ok.  NOthing amazing, nothing that really stands out.  We had the Flat Iron Steak, The Salmon, The Mozzerella Salad, the Pear Salad and the Ravioli.   The vegetables were not fully cooked with the entrees and flavor wise unimpressive. The only thing I would reorder would be the Butternut Squash Soup."}
{"text":"I loved the environment, and the staff was incredible.  

the food wasn't amazing.. just .. good.
and the cost didn't justify what was on my plate."}
{"text":"Holy Moly. With the use of fresh local produce and even more delightfully seasoned proteins this place immediately had me enamored.

I ordered the balsamic grilled chicken panini, and from the moment it graced my tastebuds with its presence an instant wave of happiness and overall satisfaction truly over came me. I don't often have such an overwhelmingly delightful experience with food outside of my mother's kitchen, but this was a foodie experience worth noting.

However, at the time of my visit the place itself was quite barren, and I was surprised at the lack of presence made by the staff. Except for the time that our food was brought to the table, no one came to check up or ask any questions. I mean, Nothing was wrong, but sometimes it is nice to be asked so that we know as customers that we are valued and that the experience we have at that establishment actually matters. 

In the end, the gourmet food options paired with an upscale interior feel made for an amazing overall experience. I look forward to visiting again the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I took her aunt here for breakfast. When our order was brought out everything looked good. It was not until I cut into my omelet that we realized that was not the case. Raw egg oozed out all over the plate. I waited for a while for the wait staff to return and had to go bring one back to the table. They were not understaffed or busy. I think they had 12 staff members and 4 tables of people including ours. When they returned with my corrected order, it was not what I ordered. It had everything on it I asked not to have and nothing I originally ordered. I would have sent it back again, except who I was there with had finished eating. I won't even go into how long it took for a coffee refill. If you don't mind waiting for service or lack of, can enjoy something you probably didn't order, this is the restaurant for you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. The complaints below are absolutely shocking. Repeat customer :)!"}
{"text":"Clean, well presented modern furnishing. Had the mint chicken salad. Great combo of flavors and very fresh. I didn't realize the portions are the size of appetizers. The portion size is tiny and very under valued for the price they have the Gaul to charge. 

Nothing worse than having to go home to eat because the meal you bought was not a value. 

If they get the portions right I would be here 2x a week. Too bad I won't be back to see...."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered the food was great. I ordered the bananas foster french toast. It was great without being too sweet. The second time I ordered the eggs Benedict. The eggs came out like hard boiled egg's usually don't send back food, but I did this time, because they took care of it quickly and the second order was cooked correctly I am still giving them 5 stars. I haven't done lunch or dinner there yet, but so far the breakfast is fantastic"}
{"text":"So, I decided to try this place despite its somewhat lackluster reviews because I thought the menu looked amazing.  I have to say, I think the 2.5 average rating this place has is about spot on.  I ordered the lemon chicken club, and when it arrived I was surprised that a) the chicken was sliced and b) it was much smaller than I pictured for $8.  I get that the menu just says \"chicken\" and I assumed how it would be served, but typically on sandwiches turkey comes sliced and chicken comes as a grilled breast.  If the chicken is sliced it usually says.  I guess this was just disappointing because it was indistinguishable from turkey, and had that kind of \"off\" flavor you can get when re-heating sliced white meats.  Maybe I was expecting too much out of a fast casual restaurant, but I thought that was the selling point of the restaurant - \"gourmet\" style food and flavors with fast casual convenience.  It was almost like they set the bar too high with their descriptions, and the food just couldn't live up to it.   

Pros - the place is very clean, the staff was very polite, and my food came out very quickly.  Cons - food and flavor was just \"ok\", and a little pricey for what you get.

I will try bluelemon again, but I might opt for a salad next time."}
{"text":"Blue lemons food is good, but the service is awful! I have been there about 4 times now and have recommended it to many. It seems like the experience has been fairly consistent. The lack of service doesn't stop me from going though. I like the atmosphere and the food."}
{"text":"Oh my!! So delicious!  Everything we ordered was wonderful!  The kids' meal was great- and the Toffee dip with the apples is a new household craving! Good portion size and good value for the money.  When we went it was pretty quiet.  A nice place for a family lunch.  I'm looking forward to coming back here with my friends!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which restaurant the other reviewer was talking about. To me it seems like a self serve restaurant. 

As you walk in you step up to a counter to order. The first thing you notice is how incredibly beautiful it is. The decor is minimalist meets shabby chic meets cafeteria, sort of. It's very hard to describe, but it's very attractive. The dichotomy between what you think it is and what it actually is happens to be very striking. It's like fast food but with serious gourmet style.

The menu is wildly diverse. From sandwiches to gourmet entrees to breakfast; this place has everything you could want. 

It seems rather new so there were some hiccups; I asked for healthy vegetarian and the guy taking my order had to ask someone, but it's only been open a few months. I'm pretty sure it will get up to speed pretty quickly.

I ordered (to go - but I had to sit at a table and wait for it) the fresh black bean ravioli and let me tell you it was some of the best ravioli I've ever had in my life. Bar none. It was also VERY affordable. The portion size was perfect and it was about $10. And did I mention it was AWESOME?

It was sitting on a bed of fresh spinach and surrounded by salsa fresca and sauteed vegetables julienne style. The roasted red pepper cream sauce didn't seem all that healthy, but it didn't seem unhealthy; no thick heavy cream taste. It was light and delicious. I almost fainted, seriously. The food is GREAT.

You get your drinks from a fountain machine and all your condiments are on pretty shelf. It's just a really nice place. The people are incredibly helpful and polite.

I highly recommend this place. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because of the wait (it advertises as 'express gourmet') and because I think the staff should really learn the menu a little better. Other than that it's definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first and last time.  Let me start by saying the food was pretty good. 

The price we paid for our meal was quite high for what we had and the serving sizes are small. The wait to order was ridiculous. It seemed to take us forever to get through the line. We were told to find a table and they would bring our drinks over to us. After almost 12 minutes my husband went to the front to find out when we we getting our drinks and were told to go to the bar and get them.  NICE!!!  Finally got the food but no one ever checked on us to see if we were satisfied with the food. 

It was extremely noisy in there but there is very little to break up the noise. Like eating in a warehouse.  Sorry but no repeat business from us."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this new place several times. I have enjoyed it each time.  The mango mint chicken salad kills it every time.  Hummus is good. Environment is bright."}
{"text":"This place is healthy and delicious! I had the tomato bisque soup and the artichoke tomato sandwich with chicken added. My date had the spinach artichoke dip, which was accompanied with several fresh cut veggies and grilled flatbread. It was reasonably priced, and I had to take half of my sandwich home. I really do not understand the poor ratings for this establishment...it's clean, the service was friendly and professional. I'll be coming back frequently!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice visiting my fiance and have not been disappointed.  

Food is always fresh tasting and serving portions worth the money. 

The hummus platter is really good.  

Staff is friendly and place is always clean and bright. 

If you are looking for something different come and let the Blue Lemon bring it to you."}
{"text":"We will give this place another try since it is new, and maybe they are just working out the kinks. We went on a Friday night, and they only had one register open for orders. The line was about 15 people deep (and stayed that way the entire time we were there eating). The woman who took our order was not at all knowledgable or super helpful about food allergies. I definitely don't expect staff to be knowledgable about allergies, but at least willing to be helpful and find out what is in the food they are serving. I asked her if the braised short ribs had gluten. She said \"it shouldn't\", I then questioned her and she said \"I don't think it does, no it doesn't\", then I asked if she could find out for sure please. She went to the kitchen (which you can see from the register) and tried to ask several people. Nobody seemed to pay much attention to her....they were all just standing around. Very strange vibe going on back there. She came back to tell us it indeed did have gluten. 

So I ordered the arugala and beet salad and I said twice - with no crustini on top (gluten). When I got my salad, the crustini was sitting right on top. They re-made it for me, but my husband was 100% done eating his food by the time my salad came out!! He ordered the short rib - he said it was quite dry and very underseasoned (he's a chef, so yes, we do have standards). I had also ordered a side of fingerling potatoes to go with my salad - which they never brought out. When they brought my salad out the 2nd time around, I reminded the food runner that I was waiting for them. He brought out sweet potato fries instead. Not what we ordered, so the kind young man brought out the potatos I did order several minutes later. They were completely cold and did not look appetizing - and they tasted how they looked. Ugh. I had two bites and just left them. 

Prices are right. My salad was good. Atmosphere is nice - a bit cold and sterile feeling, and the employees seem like they are zoned out and nobody was smiling - including the manager (or who seemed to be). Come on people, if you want to run a restaurant - it's all about CUSTOMER SERVICE. We will wait a few months and then try this place again....hopefully they will have it down by then."}
{"text":"Very slow...and there's not very many people.   Didn't bring food for two people.   When we asked why they said the cooked accidentally closed our order.   No real apologies.  Food ok but not worth the lack of service."}
{"text":"Average food, lousy service, dirty utensils and a fly was on our food! The gal that brought us our food didn't even care (or so it seems). Bad management!  Get a grip and you just might make it."}
{"text":"One of the best new places in Gilbert! The decor is sleek, clean, and modern looking. I've only tried one item here because I'm so in love with this dish but according to my family there are other delicious things too. My favorite thing is the chipotle BBQ brisket sandwich. It's delicious every time! 

My only criticism would be that the prices are a little too high. It's stopped us from going here on more than one occasion. But when we do decide it's worth it, we always have a great experience."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were excited to try this place out. We wanted to get healthy and tasty food. Unfortunately we got what resembled reheated microwaved old chicken, something similar to what would be served on and airplane. My grilled chicken salad had deli meat on it and avocado with black spots. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see all the negative reviews of this place. My wife and I went yesterday for lunch, and absolutely loved it. I ordered the tomato artichoke panini, and she ordered the Anaheim chicken sandwich. We both had the spinach pear salad. The presentation was beautiful and the food was really good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a salad here. A fancy expensive salad, so was expecting a bit more, but didn't get it.  It was pretty bland, expensive, and blah.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was like the early reviewers - excited to try a new place that was healthy with a twist. When you walk in, Blue Lemon entices you with its clean, open and airy layout and pops of color. I was teetering between a salad or burger and from the staff's recommendation went for my protein intake. So based on that, I had high hopes for the Black and Blue burger.

I rarely write negative reviews and even more rarely send food back but this was the first exception. My burger was more than over charred, dry to the point that the house fry sauce couldn't revive the meat. Additionally, my sweet potato fries were so soggy. It seemed the temperature got cross wired between the entree and side dish. So I waited with anticipation for the second attempt only to discover my fries to be blackened and my burger not quite burnt but surely overdone.

The staff is young and in need of strong management for customer service training. No one checked to see if the chef corrected the first mistake, and secondly, my friend brought the redo to me. Very disappointed for Gilbert on this eatery and hope they can manage to turn things around. I think I would have been happier with a double double protein style."}
{"text":"Love the concept of savory, clean eating.  4 visits layer and I'm finally convinced they are not able to provide a good consistent dining experience.  The first time the food was good service terrible.  2nd visit (early on a Friday night) out of flat bread... What restaurant runs out of one of their signature items before the biggest dinning out night of the week?  We got bbq beef sandwiches which were awesome... but they brought out sweet potato fries that were burnt black.  One thing to burn them another to serve them.  You can see our dilemma... They showed promise but never delivered.  3rd visit more of the same.  4th visit I thought I'd try for breakfast.  An hour past opening time, the door was open, no sign off a breakfast menu, nobody at the counter, not another person dining, staff see me but ignore me for 4 minutes.  As I leave someone finally says \"good morning. we are open\".  Too late!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the overall experience and will return again . Sure, every start-up has kinks to work out, but it is very evident that this concept will be successful in Gilbert.  The food was a bit pricy for an order at the counter type of restaurant, but the food quality did not disappoint.  All of the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I look forward to trying something new when I return."}
{"text":"Don't understand why this place doesn't have 5 stars. Some of the best salads in town. Fresh healthy food.  Love the butternut squash soup and the coconut curry dish. I eat here often!!!"}
{"text":"My co workers and I are big fans. Most dishes we've had have been great, though the turkey burger was only meh."}
{"text":"Great place with delicious food! When you advertise yourself as serving \"pure clean food with a twist,\" you had better live up to expectations! And Blue Lemon does. 

I've been there twice now, once to dine in and once for takeout, and was pretty blown away each time.

This is a counter-order restaurant, and I actually like that since it cuts down on price and dining wait time. The food is indeed healthy and served very well. The ingredients are pretty great, too. I was really surprised at the number of sun-dried tomatoes in my fettucine alfredo. Those, along with a generous amount of portobello mushrooms and spinach, made this dish a nice surprise.

My favorite thing on the menu has to be the tomato bisque soup. It is truly excellent. My son pronounced the kids' chicken tenders meal as excellent, and I saw kids at a nearby table devouring their macaroni.

Nice decor and atmosphere, too.

Like the previous reviewer, I also think the digital menus were a little hard to read, but the line wasn't long for me at all. The staff tries to make it easier on you by giving you takeout menus to read while in line, but I think once people become familiar with the menu and concept those complaints will go away.

In a land of gross chain restaurants with tons of fried, fatty food, I'm so glad that this place has landed in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"As a resident of the dining wasteland of Gilbert, AZ, I am hopeful this place will get a lot better.  Our experience was not so good.  I have heard great things about Blue Lemon and  their unique menu.  The decor is cool and hip.  You order at a walk up counter and they bring you your food.  My group of 5 ordered a turkey burger (dry and not worth $8), tuna salad (great), braised beef (excellent), bbq sandwich (very good) and black bean ravioli (also very good).  The real problem was the staff.  The cashier added a $5 mystery charge and then did not know how to remove it.  The food came at different times."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place through a friend and we decided to go for Sat morning breakfast. We arrived at 11:05 & were told they stopped serving breakfast at 11:00. Hesitantly we stayed even though we really wanted breakfast. 
Place is cute, trendy, and clean. You order at a counter and they bring your food to the table you choose. 
I had the turkey cranberry sandwich which was $9 with no sides or drink. Flavor was mediocre. Tomato soup was thick and tasty. My husband had the fish tacos, and it was fresh and filling. The tortilla soup was good and spicy. Overall it was ok but expensive. Place is huge and at lunch time on a Saturday, it was pretty empty. We won't go back and I'm sad about that. Such a cute place!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed. So expensive for so little food.  Sweet potato fries were good but overpriced as well. We won't be back"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try for breakfast today, wow what a disappointment.  
I ordered the blue sunrise (2 eggs, turkey sausage, rosemary hash browns and sour dough toast) and my wife ordered the artisan breakfast sandwich.  

When the order came out my potatoes were cold, the sour dough toast was cold and hard as a brick and my wife's \"sandwich\" incorrectly came out as a wrap.
 
We sent both back.  On the second try the sandwich was ok but my sourdough toast, although warm this time, was too hard to cut and the potatoes, although warm, still were looking for a sign that they made it to a hot pan. Kind of a beige color. 

I asked for jelly or jam for my toast, received a tub of marmalade- not my favorite.

The \"side of fresh fruit\"  that came with both breakfasts consisted of a couple of blueberries, a few slices of strawberries and slices of apple so sour we did not eat them.

We both had black coffee, which was very good and came in a large cup.

Not a fan of walking in and ordering at the front before sitting down, either.

The signage on the building says Pure Clean Food with a Twist.... not today."}
{"text":"Tried once for dinner and it was just okay. Tried again for breakfast and hated it. Eggs florentine has about a teaspoon of hollandaise, unripened tomatoes and hardly any spinach. Hubby hated the turkey bacon and his toast was hard as a rock. Potatoes weren't cooked through or were overcooked and way toooooo much rosemary. Everything was cold. Fresh seasonal fruit was an apple (in August). Not sure, but coffee tasted like it was instant. And service is nonexistent, both times. Good concept, poor execution."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice. It was clean and had hip vibe about the place.  Service was good. I order the roasted turkey avocado sandwich.  The sandwich was tasty and had a good bread to meat ratio. I liked the avocado.  It was a little heavy on the aioli.  My disappointment was in the price for what you received.  The sandwich was a good size, but for $9 it should come with some small side (fruit, veggies, chips, cup of soup etc.)  It would make the plate look better and for the price of the sandwich I think it is expected.  Not sure I will return because of the value.  I have eaten a many lunch places and it didn't seem the price met value for what you received."}
{"text":"Great place but when I drove up today workers were removing their signs and closing the place down. Too bad!"}
{"text":"We were nervous when we walked in and the place was almost empty. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. We ordered at the counter, filled our water cups and sat down. Within 6 minutes we had our food brought to us. The staff were extremely nice. I ordered a roasted beet salad and my husband ordered a black and blue burger. My husband thought the burger was good, but not impressive. The only downside was it didn't come with fries, just the burger alone. My husband ordered a side of sweet potato fries since the burger alone was not enough food. I was very impressed with my beet salad! It was delicious and huge! Overall we had a good experience and will be coming back with our friends."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We sat the bar..

Clean, bright, and cold atmosphere. Food was bland (I had the chicken tacos), and portions were VERY small....my roommate and I went home and had another meal immediately. Service was almost non-existent. The server asked us if we had a pen to sign our receipts.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Great place, love the tasty food and awesome service. My kiddos love the kids menu. I love all the vegetarian options. There is something for everyone on the menu. Give this place a try, its one of our favs!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch. Both times I received my food in a timely manner and the staff was friendly. The decor is really fun and contemporary. I have had the mushroom Flatbread and Asian chicken salad, both were really good. Reading some of the other reviews people complained about the service, this is an order when you first arrive, go fill your own drink, sit and they will bring out your food to you. This is not a full service dining experience,  that is not the concept so not sure why it's so hard to go and fill your own drink. The price point is right on and I look forward to returning for lunch again."}
{"text":"Ate here today and shared the bbq sandwich and the raspberry salad. Sooo delicious! And very fast and great service! It's so cute inside too and very clean! So glad we ran into this place! It's our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying NOT A FAN
That being said, it is clean and new so that's a plus 
It took a long time to stand and wait in line instead of being seated at a table and being served
The staff seemed untrained and the register was not stocked to give change for a $20 and the register attendant was irritated and made some wild comments that would not go so well in a fine establishment
The food is pricy but not worth it 
I ordered the black and blue burger and sweet potato fries for an extra $2
The fries were stale and only 19 small fries for $2 not included with the entree is weird
The burger was soggy, I mean gross soggy I could not eat a 1/3 of it and the bacon was cold and hard 
The self serve drink machines get a line built up waiting for people that can't figure out how to use them since they are the all in one style 
The bathroom was very clean and new so That's a plus 
I doubt I will return I'm giving it 2 1/2 stars 3 since I can't choose 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We got the beef tacos and one of their turkey/avocado/spinache salad and loved both of them. You don't get very much food for what you pay, but the quality was definitely up there. Fun and different atmosphere to eat in, especially enjoyed their drink, coffee, and tea bar. Not my first choice on places to relax and socialize over dinner though."}
{"text":"Blue lemon is a real cute place, the decor is great, love their little coffee bar area! I ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken it was yummy and light!  I would go again!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the salad was drenched in dressing, that didn't really taste \"clean\". The portions were small and the prices were high. The food was ready in record time and the atmosphere was interesting. Overall I probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"It claims it's a fresh twist...was not fresh. The chicken on my salad tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for days. The ahi tuna tasted like it had been seared several days ago, heated back up and thrown on my rice. And I mean \"thrown\". Saving grace is that even though I told the \"waiter\" it was fine and I just wanted a spinach salad instead, he still brought me a $15 gift card. So service is great. It was my second time here. I came when they first opened, and it was mind blowing. Just feels like they're slacking a bit now."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Shrimp Cusabi Salad with the wasabi dressing on the side. This is Gluten-free.

This dish is fun and delicious.

{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. The food is healthy & I don't feel gross after eating. The place is clean & decorated very chic & current to today's \"clean eaters\". 

I would probably agree with other reviewers about the portion size to price ratio. The portions are small for what you pay for BUT it is healthy food. So I understand why it's pricey. I love coming to eat here!"}
{"text":"We tried Blue Lemon for breakfast today. I am not sure if we will be back. There were twice as many servers as guests and the service was awful. I watched two tables that came in after us be served. After we complained she said she would \" check on it\". 10 minutes later, mind you we have now been waiting over a 1/2 hr ,.my husbands wrap arrived......I ordered the house special pancakes...they arrived 10 minutes after my husbands. NO ONE came over to acknowledge the mistake the kitchen made by overlooking our order. None of the staff showed any energy. Very disappointed !"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. We had heard good things and Blue Lemon failed to deliver everywhere.

This is an order-at-the-counter place. They say \"gourmet express\" on their cups. Unfortunately it was neither gourmet nor express.

The line to place the order had 4 or 5 groups in front of us. There are two registers, but only one was open. We waited 15-20 minutes to place our order. What was disappointing is that the place was almost empty and there were 5 or so staff standing around waiting for food to come out of what appears to be a very small kitchen for the size of the restaurant. They probably can't open the second register, as it would slam the tiny kitchen.

We sat down and waited for our meal which didn't seem to take too long to arrive. Unfortunately, the food had been cooked a while before we received it because the steak was cold. Not cool or slightly warm, but actually cold. The sweet potato fries were both cold and soggy. Not fresh, not hot and not crispy. 

The tasty-sounding short rib sandwich was not very flavorful, not very warm and had not so great iceburg lettuce.

Back to the steak. Did you know they do not have a steak knife in the whole restaurant?  This made for a comical moment as our son wanted to take a turn at trying to cut the steak with the knife and ended up sliding the plate around so much that it flew off the table. :)

This concept, price and menu has some similarities to Liberty Market in Downtown Gilbert. Except that Liberty Market is really good. This is terrible."}
{"text":"Had the butternut squash soup and salad.  It was amazing the vibe is relaxed cool and the food is definitely made fresh with great ingredients."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor.  Pretty decent food.  Salads are fresh.  Prices are too high.  Serve is mediocre."}
{"text":"I think that if everyone can get past the location they will love this restaurant! The fish tacos are excellent the breakfasts are great the turkey burger is fabulous! Although I am not a fan of the cafeteria style beginning the food is excellent and worth your time!"}
{"text":"Quick. Healthy options. Clean. Close to 60 freeway. Beef short ribs and coconut curry chicken are favorites."}
{"text":"I love this place! We were greeted by a very pleasant young woman who seemed to like what she was doing. She knew the menu and made recommendations. The prices are great for the food. Not sure why anyone is complaining about the prices. Where are all of you eating (Country Buffet)? I had the butternut Squash soup. That was fantastic! It was thick, great flavor and could have been a meal in itself. I also had the Pear and Gorgonzola Spinach Salad except I substituted mixed greens for the spinach (I just hate raw spinach for some reason). This substitution was made without any difficulty. I loved the salad and it was huge. Just the right amounts of pear, turkey bacon, and cheese without any one thing overwhelming the other. And the dressing wasn't over done which a lot of places do by soaking the salad. But not this one. Just the right taste and balance. 
My friend had a sandwich using lettuce leaves as she was trying to diet. But she was able to use her extra calories for the sweet potato fries (another recommendation by the hostess). She liked everything. 
The food was brought out by super friendly staff members. 
The decor is simple but super cute. It's casual seating and we sat in the area with hip blue sofas. The place has the feel of being super clean and mode. 
I highly recommend Blue Lemon for healthy eating with great prices."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but we've tried it twice and both experiences were just so-so. First time, the soup was awesome, but my flatbread was COLD. Toppings weren't even room temperature. (Heated at home, it was quite good tho!). So a week later we went back and I ordered the same soup, only this time I got 1/2 as much! And barely any nuts on top. Being inconsistent is a sure way for a restaurant to shoot itself in the foot. Also, when the cashier handed me my cup for soda, she did so with her fingers holding the cup by the rim -where I will be drinking from- (and right after handling money!). I was so grossed out. ANYONE who works in the food industry, even if you are only cashiering, should be taught basic food handling cleanliness. That alone grossed me out and made me lose my appetite. I mean, would you hand someone a fork or spoon by the part they are about to put in their mouth?! Ick.  Again, I really want to love this place. Nice atmosphere and a great menu. I hope the management will get things consistent and teach clean food-handling."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place at first. The food looked and sounded good on the menu, but it was just so-so, and I felt like the flavor was just slightly on the bland side. It seems like they're more about looks than flavor. Plus, there was a hair in my sandwich... which kind of put the sour cherry on top of my dining experience."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice.  The first time was for dinner. We got the hummus plate and the fish tacos. The fish tacos were actually pretty good. I felt it was a bit pricey for what you got but it was decent food. This time I went back for breakfast. Not so good. I got an omelette that was tasteless and my hubby got a breakfast wrap which was also tasteless. The service was also very poor.  I really wanted  to like this place because I think it has great potential. I'm thinking the management may be the issue here. A lot of young servers with no training and the food is just above par.  Too bad...."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a good meal here since it was recommended by a few ladies from my AJ swimming class. The place is HUGE with tall ceilings, super airy on cement floors. My food was OK, on the small side and possibly w/no side dish except some garnish. ON the plus side they do have one of those cool soda machines nowwa days where you have about 100 choices of things to drink.
2 stars because the atmosphere didn't appeal to me, the food was below my standards and it just didn't float my boat. 
However it was clean! Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"over priced for what you get!! ordered the steak griller for my husband, it states a steak with sauteed vegetables and fingerling potatoes. When our food came my the steak was on top of a few vegies and two cut peices of potatoes, the vegetables and the potatoes were at room temperature, not luke warm but cold. I ordered the lemon grilled chicken BLT, from the description I thought i would be getting a chicken breast that was grilled but there was hardly any chicken on my sandwich and it looked like chicken lunch meat. The sandwich was 8.50 and that is all it came with was just a sandwich, it wasn't bad but for 8.50 expecting a lot more, our daughter got the kids menu of chicken fingers, 3 pre packaged chicken strips that they deep fried and were a little burnt on the ends it came with 2 slices of cucumbers and a carrot for 5 dollars.  the interior is beautifully done, the girl at the cashier has absolutely no personality when you ask her questions about the menu, no a lot of input and seems to be bothered and no one checks on you to see how your food is and my husband was so hungry he just ate it and wanted to leave. We had to go get food from another establishment because my husband and daughter were both still hungry. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here. I always like to give places more than one chance to impress me. I should have guessed after the first two attempts that it would not have been any better. Unfortunately it was even worse, I got the black and blue burger and it was disgusting. Not only was the turkey bacon hard as a rock, it was cold. The side of sweet potato fries were burnt in places and cold in others not mention limp like a wet noodle. (There were about 6 of them on my plate) If I wanted food that was sitting around and waiting to be warmed up until I ordered it, I would have gone to the Jack n' the box in the same parking lot and probably had a better burger. Obviously everything is processed and not cooked to order. The fresh, clean, pure food with a twist is a cleaver marketing tactic to get people  in the door. There was nothing fresh, clean or pure about it and the twist was the food is horrible."}
{"text":"We had the pear salad and two different chicken sandwiches, loved it! Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly.  We didn't wait long at all for our food and everyone was very friendly and helpful.  I'm surprised more people aren't raving about this gem!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For an establishment that markets being fresh and healthy I'm shocked by the limited vegetarian options. It's really close to my house so I go sometimes for lunch or just a beer on the patio. But I really wish they'd up the game on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a few weeks because as a vegetarian, I am a sucker for natural, organic places.

I wish I could say that I loved this place. I really do. I wanted to. I tried. 

*sigh* Didn't happen. 

Pros:
* The decor is cool and new.
* They have the cool drink station with tons of beverage options.

Cons:
* The vegetarian offerings are slim unless you want to eat a ton of cheesy, simple white carbs as the options are either served on white bread or are a pasta.
* The food was very oily, which is not something i expect from a place that promotes healthy, clean food.
* They are pricey and the servings are small.
* NO nutrition info available anywhere. I like to know how much fat, sugar, calories are in my meals.
* The staff was not knowledgeable about the menu. When asking questions, we were either told that they didn't know or they simply read to us off the menu.

Seriously bummed out because I was so excited about trying this place and most Gilbert residents will agree that we need some good healthy options on the east side."}
{"text":"The food was over priced for what it was. My husband wanted to try it, so we did and neither of us was that thrilled. I think you're paying for the atmosphere more so than the actual food. The design inside is definitely different, kind of trendy and retro, but it's nothing that we will be going back for."}
{"text":"Living in VVL we were so excited to hear about Blue Lemon opening that also served beer & wine.  We love heathy eating and from that stand point the menu options are pretty good.  Where I feel Blue Lemon has completely dropped the ball is with good old fashion customer service.  The training of their staff has to be non-existent as they are very unfriendly and seemingly unknowledgeable.  Gilbert is a family community where simple kindness and developing relationships with your patrons will go miles for a small business.  We tried breakfast one morning and honestly we thought the food was good and  decent value.  The challenge was that my breakfast came out 5+ minutes earlier than my wife's so by the time I was over halfway thru my breakfast she finally received hers.  Poor kitchen efficiency.  Lastly we were so excited to see that they had an outside patio and bar area!  I don't know who chose their furniture outside but it has to be some of the most uncomfortable metal chairs and stools I have ever experienced.  I truly hope they figure everything out as this community does support small business but they have a lot of fine tuning to do before I will make another visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited to try this place as it is close to our home and the marketing on the website shows a very neat, clean and fun place to dine.  We arrived early Sunday (3/9/14) morning around 8:00 AM, we were not the first there but there was by no means a crowd of people.  The place was clean looking so our hopes were high...we ordered our breakfast and found a table and waited to try the food!  We waited, waited and waited some more...finally a young server came over and delivered our coffee...which had a nice presentation but a lousy flavor or more correctly a lack of flavor.  We waited some more...and more and after about 25 minutes breakfast arrives...again looking forward to it.   The food was cold...not kind of warm but ice cold.  The eggs were burnt, the potatoes looked cooked, the ham was burnt and the toast was burnt...and all of it ice cold.  The crepes were also ice cold.  We informed the young server and now waited for someone to approach and deal with this problem.  The manager went into hiding and sent the young server to deal with the problem...It ain't over yet folks....the young server could not deal with the refund on my card (used to pay for the ice cold meals) but needed her manager...waited some more...finally went up to the bar (where the young server was working) and she just took cash out of the till to refund me part of my breakfast.  The manager never showed her face to deal with this problem.  This is bad customer service, lousy food which in turn means that I will tell everyone I know not to go to the Blue Lemon as it is just that...a LEMON!"}
{"text":"Like so many other reviews I was excited to see a new restaurant with clean healthy options.  Unfortunately nothing about this restaurant was great.  This was our second visit to Blue Lemon and probably our last unless management and customer service improves.  On this trip it was busy but not packed as several tables were available.  Only one cashier and a line out the door but several workers just standing around with dirty tables everywhere.  Food is ok but you don't get very much for the money so I would not say it is a good value.  We finally found a clean table when two out of three of my kids meals arrived well before our humus plate.  Then everything else came out in stages as well.  I asked to talk to a manager in which I watched him tell the server he was too busy.  He then sent a poor young man over to see what we needed but it was the manager I needed.  We finished our food and left before a manager ever came over to our table.  I know it is a newer restaurant but it is very poorly managed."}
{"text":"We walked into Blue Lemon excited to try a new place with a healthy twist. A nice greeter opened the door for us,  we waited in line for a second, but decided to go the bar and have drinks with our food. We walked up to the bar and sat down. 
As the only guest there, I was surprised at the lack of service. We  sat at the bar for about ten minutes, while the Peach Ale called my name from across the bar. My husband asked if they were open at the bar, since we have yet to be acknowledged. The bartender/waitress replied with a quick \"Yes\" and continued on ignoring us.

 I started googling their menu from my phone, so we would be ready by the time we actually got the attention of someone. After sitting for another five minutes, my husband asked if they had menus and she grabbed a couple and slid them across the bar and AGAIN turned around walked out of the bar area.  Meanwhile our tummies were growling so we left without even a glass of water, which could have quenched my thirst, while I took my business to a local restaurant. 

Bottom line: HORRIBLE SERVICE

UPDATE: We went back to give it a second chance and tried the food and it was horrible.  My husband explained it as the worst food he as ever had.  The food was cold and I believe it was wayyyy overpriced. $45 dollars for two = cold fish, two beers, and horrible service. Should have went with our first instinct and saved ourselves a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Yes, there are some glitches going on in this brand new restaurant in Gilbert.  But after those get worked out, this place will be awesome!  The food is really good and healthy and you can taste the quality the minute you put it in your mouth,  The Turkey and Avocado sandwich is my fave--the turkey is just as if you carved it from your Thanksgiving bird. Delicious!  Also, their sweet squash soup is my favorite dessert!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Blue Lemon. We had a coupon for BOGO half off and I had always been intrigued when passing this trendy-looking eatery. The staff were very friendly. I had the turkey avocado ciabatta and my husband had the steak tacos. Both dishes were extremely tasty. We will definitely be returning to try other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"The place is cute and the employees are nice but the food is sooooo bland. Tastes like something you would heat up in a microwave. Plus the advertise to be a \"modern cuisine\" but they play ragtime music from the 1920's. C'mon...if I can't enjoy the food at least play some half decent music."}
{"text":"Seriously great food! Low prices and decor that rocks. Lets not forget the staff and their awesomeness... People patronize this business. We have enough crap chain and fast food joints around here!"}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE with this place. The Mediterranean salad is delish. As is the flour-less chocolate cake. Super friendly staff and nice atmosphere. The only complaint I have is that I can not find any of the nutritional information online nor do they have it in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved it! It had a lot of flavor on their chicken blt! Delicious salads, and bread! The dipping bread with hummus was delicious. The bread had flavor, soft, and warm. I am coming back and soon!"}
{"text":"Very cute and comfortable ambiance.  The food was good for it's price. I got the whole hummus plate and a side of sweet potato fries. My total was around $10. The food is lacking some flavor but you can taste the freshness."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The mushroom and feta flatbread, the mint mango salad, and the fire roasted Anaheim chicken sandwich were outstanding. Definitely coming back all the time! I'm confused about the people not liking the service, because you're supposed to go up to the counter and order your food and sit down until the food comes out. The servers were very attentive I thought. Overall I'm a huge fan! Great, fresa, and local beers and wines."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  My mother and I have been wanting to try this place out for a couple of months now (very excited about the pure clean eating advertised). Not to mention the gentleman that told us about this place had been to BlueLemon over 20 times in the last 3 months... now you know you have to try a place like that. I mean that is a lot of times to go to one restaurant. So finally went yesterday afternoon about 5:30pm. There is a lot of seating there inside and outside. Very trendy fresh looking restaurant. At the time we arrived there were probably 8 tables being used... which was nice to not have to wait. Timing was perfect. We ordered our food at the counter and sat where we wanted and within minutes are dinner plates were delivered. THAT WAS FAST!  We had the Oriental Salad, sweet potato fries and the Artichoke and Fire-Roasted Tomato Chicken dish. WOW! Very tasty plates and very filling. We also ordered their frozen mint lemonade which we were surprised to see that the mint and lemon were actually juiced there on site. We enjoyed our drinks and excited to try their Frozen Lavendar Lemonade on our next trip there. We also ordered the Hazelnut Cake (from a local bakery).. only ate half and took the rest home. We were stuffed to the gills ... all night long. 
The staff were very friendly and very helpful!  We are planning on going again this weekend for breakfast. CANNOT WAIT!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. The prices are fine, especially given the quality of food. My husband and I have been here twice and ordered different things each time. 

We've never been during a peak hour so I can't really speak to the lines. Service has always been prompt and friendly. 

The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here, thought it was supposed to be healthy. Ordered a sandwich, it was soaked in butter, and the bread was soggy. The kids meals came out way before our meals did, then the sides, then 10 minutes later after the sides came out we got our sandwiches...weird. Our items had ingredients that were listed on the menu missing. We had to ask for silver wear. This place has no idea what they are doing."}
{"text":"Food is very good. However, Blue Lemon, for being a \"clean\" eating establishment one would think you'd have the nutritional facts in your restaurant or at very least online! This is disappointing to those of us trying to eat healthy and make good nutritional choices. PLEASE get the nutritional values out there for all of your menu items and quickly!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, lured by the healthy, fresh, aspect of the food here. The menu includes sandwiches, salads, and soups. You can also substitute the ingredients in any sandwich into a wrap. 

The main problem here is the painstakingly slow service to get our food. We each ordered salads, mainly because we thought that would be the easiest item for the chefs to make. We ordered around 12:10-12:15, and had an excruciating wait for our food, which did not come all at the same time. My order came last, at 12:45, leaving me only a few minutes to eat before we had to get back to work at 1 P.M. 30 minutes to make a simple salad? Really?

When I actually got my salad, it was a fairly sizable portion. I had the roasted beet salad ($8), which included slices of roasted beets on the bottom layer, with mixed greens, candied pecans, and feta cheese. It was slightly overdressed, but overall decent. Too bad I only had a few minutes to eat it, as I tried to scarf as much down as possible in a short amount of time.

While they have a Coca Cola freestyle machine here for fizzy fountain drinks, their iced tea is made separately and has to be refilled by a server. The fountain drinks come in a plastic cup you can bring back with you, as opposed to the iced tea, which comes in a glass. Due to the slow service and our need to get back to work, I wasn't able to request a to-go cup or a refill on my tea so I could take it back, while the other people who got a fountain drink instead were able to take a refill to go.

So if you go here, go when you aren't in a rush for time due to the long wait for your meal."}
{"text":"The WORST lunch experience I've had in ages. I don't often write bad reviews and I love when Gilbert gets a new, healthy-alternative restaurant, but this was just so bad from start to finish that I am compelled to give feedback.

First, we arrived at 11:30AM to beat the lunch rush only to stand in line for a full 30 minutes before getting to order. This gave us ample time to review the beautiful digital menu boards hanging over the front counter. However, when we placed our order we were informed that those menus were not current and we should have been looking at the paper menus (available at the front of the line when you reach the cash register). So what we had planned to order was no longer available on the menu. 

I opted for the Steak and Heirloom Potato Salad for around $11. It was 80% greens, which happened to be the best part of the salad. The potatoes were so undercooked that they were crunchy when I bit into them and the \"steak\" tasted like it was either microwaved or rancid...not sure which.  The croutons were burnt to black, didn't try them. The tomatoes were wrinkled and mushy.  The other ingredients that were supposed to be on the salad: creamy gorgonzola and caramelized red onions, were nowhere to be found. 

I ate some greens and then quit. I was feeling nervous for an employee to ask me about it because I never send food back, but no worries, no one ever came by to check how everything was or attempt to remove my plate even though we sat there for about an hour.  Such a disappointing experience. We won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Hoping to find an additional breakfast place to add to my short list...this place didn't make the cut. I probably should have known better since there were two diners sitting amoung 40 open tables.  Went very basic, eggs over medium...hmmmm maybe too basic. Eggs were over cooked completely, potatoes were over cooked, dry as microwave popcorn....Oh well, maybe lunch is better, but I doubt I'll try it because when I informed the waitress about the eggs I actually got some attitude, which I chalk up to the fact that she looked like she was 17 and probably doesn't know the difference between types of egg preparation."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars, I have hopes that it will get better.

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip. The order came out before we were even seated. The spread of dip and veggies was nicely displayed and the dip was tasty. 

I ordered the steak salad with the heirloom potatoes. Overall I liked it, I felt like the portion was a little small for the $10 I paid. I do feel like the dressing could have been a little more seasoned or a few more toppings could have been tossed into the salad. The sandwiches I saw coming out looked very yummy and I would be willing to go back and try that sometime. 

This place would be even more appealing to me if they offered gluten free breads and were Non-GMO and or organic."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good but the restaurant was very clean. I wouldn't put it on a list of places that I have to go back to. Not a brunch restaurant as listed in Yelp-disappointing on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Braised short ribs were so tender and cooked perfectly. Hummus plate presentation was nice but not practical with tomatoes and celery. Just keep it simple with cucumber, carrots, olives and more pita bread. Lemon Chicken Curry was flavorful. But the lemon chicken over powered the curry. Flavored tea was refreshing. I'd bring the family back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Sleek place with very good food. The staff were helpful & friendly. We have a lot of allergies and were both able to find excellent choices with the server's help. 
Everything came quickly.
As far as the food, it was all delicious - some was amazing. My partner had the short ribs, which was perfect. A big, moist piece of meat lightly seasoned. I had soup and salad - the tomato bisque was good, and the spinach and pear salad was great (the side salad was quite enough - between the two dishes, I needed help finishing). Strawberry lemonade was quite tasty. 
It was a little on the expensive side, presumably because everything is fresh and made there."}
{"text":"Stupidly I ignored the bad reviews--figured Blue Lemon would have seen them and worked to improve. Sadly the reviews are pretty accurate. Met 4 friends for lunch today and told the order taker we wanted all food out at the same time. Two plates came out pretty quickly and after almost 10 minutes we asked one of the boys to check. He did not come back but was yakking with a coworker so I asked him did he check. Yes, it will be out soon. WTF? Are they brain dead? The food we got was tasty but skimpy portions (very little turkey on avocado turkey sandwich) and no chips or sides come with the $9 sandwich. There does not appear to be a manager or owner on the premises. The line moves very slowly. I would go to Wildflower or Paradise Bakery and would not go back to Blue Lemon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I will say that the decor is nice and modern, good service, and the happy hour drink prices are great. However, the food was not good. It did not seem healthy to me- I eat at many vegan and all natural restaurants. Our flatbread tasted like it was soaked in salt. I would return if the food was actually good, but it was not."}
{"text":"Blue lemon is our recent go to when we want healthy and quick.  It's clean with healthy choices with the right amount of food.  It's not too much food it's about the portion size.  The kids eat well here.  I'd say my only complaint is it would be nice if the menu was slightly bigger.

Great place!"}
{"text":"Torn on this one. This is another entry into the semi fast sit down style restaurant like a pei Wei or paradise bakery. Order at cashier and sit and wait for food. No other service. The atmosphere looks beautiful and open. Almost to open. No one seems to be going. I ordered the steak tacos. Got two and a side of chips and guac. Not quite enough for me and the price of $13 with tip and tax. The tacos were very yummy though. The quac was good as well. Just not enough. Don't like places making us download their app to use pay by phone. STOP! Please just accept apple pay. So annoying."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and unfortunately I didn't like it. 

Came here tonight with my sister. Walked in and it's cute, clean, bright and decorated really nicely. But the menus on the wall are so difficult to read! The print is too small. We were about the 5th group in line to order and waited about 20 minutes to get to the counter {it is an order at the counter and seat yourself kind of place- which I like} quite a long wait- but no worries it's new. 

We ordered sweet potato fries, artichoke and spinach dip and a pear and Gorgonzola salad. The girls taking the orders were nice enough just slow moving. 

We take our sit and within 30 seconds our salad and fries are out. First thing I think - ok so not fresh food. Boy was I right! 

Soggy fries with a very weird almost tasteless dip. I'm gonna go ahead and say those fries were frozen. They went from warm to cold in about two minutes. 

The salad was especially not impressive. The pear was mushy and bruised, cheap tasteless \"Gorgonzola\", a few grapes, and carrots. Dressing was ok but for $9 this was way overpriced. No cheese barely and also small, very small. 

The spinach artichoke dip actually grossed me out. Comes with pita bread, carrots, cucumbers and celery. The veggies were dripping with water and again- bruised cucumber. The dip was horrible- warm not hot and just not a good taste. 

It's hard to write this review for a place that I want to like so badly but the quality of food isn't there. For a restaurant that advertises fresh they may want to stop reheating their food. 

1 star for decor and cleanliness. Sorry Charlie I won't be back."}
{"text":"Deceiving slogan: not pure, clean food.  Not fresh.  Tasted like cafeteria food. Poor service to boot."}
{"text":"Food was just mediocre especially for the price.  I had the lemon chicken BLT and it just seemed bland, nothing special. My son had the kids Mac and cheese and he couldn't even eat more than a bite. I tried it and it was tasteless.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Wow! Healthy food that tastes good! This place is excellent and caters to gluten free. I had the Chicken Lemon BLT and side of Brussels sprouts. Yummers! Food comes out super fast and portions are just right so you don't walk out in a food coma."}
{"text":"We couldn't move past 3 stars after what we just witnessed. Young chef handled raw meat with gloves then handled our cooked pizza! Not okay! Last time a member of our party was sick with some sort of stomach flu. We cannot confirm it was from eating here, but after seeing that nastiness I wouldn't doubt it. Ugh! We're not willing to give up yet, their food is unique and interesting. Most of the time it's decent although it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday. My daughter and I were one of two tables in the whole place. It was just before 9am. Food was fine and prompt... Although a teeny bit pricey. Just as most people have said - service is terrible. No one checked on us the whole time. I had to find someone to get a box for the other half of my wrap. They weren't understaffed by any means - 2 girls at the registers when we walked in, one sitting at the bar eating & a guy was sweeping. As a matter of fact, he & the girl that took/delivered our order were both sweeping within 5 feet of one another.Then a hotel shuttle dropped off 2 older, manger-looking guys... So was there no management for the 2 hours they'd been open? It was kind of odd.
I think the place is cute and could be fun if they trained their staff to be more customer service oriented. And I only happened upon it driving through the parking lot, yet I live less than 2 miles away. Are they doing any advertising? There's a whole community they're missing out on just around the corner. But they've got to get their staffing right before they expect to show people a good time. 
Final thought... Sat on the patio as the weather was very cool & felt the only thing missing was a beach :) oh, and our server to see how we were doing.
The end."}
{"text":"I love, coming here. The salad are great. It is a great healthy choice. I had the raspberry chicken salad. It is my fav on the menu. Next time, I'm trying a sandwich :-)"}
{"text":"I am not impressed with Blue lemon. I give it one star for the awesome decor but besides there is nothing much to it. The food was not that good and although it did come out fast I would rather take my ten dollars else were."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I really, really like the food. The blueberry green tea blender is pretty amazing as well. There hasn't been a wait when I have come here, but it does appear to get busy. Despite that, the food is delivered to the table quite quickly so I don't have any complaints about the food or service."}
{"text":"In February, I saw this place advertised on the news...They did a whole segment on them.  Looked delish.  I loved that they said they only use local produce from the farmers markets...Being a loyal shopper at all the local markets, I was excited.  Doubly excited that I live not far.
I drove by on their opening evening (not to go there, just in the neighborhood)  I was stunned at how FEW people were there.
Anywhoo...FINALLY went this afternoon with a friend.  We walked in, and were not greeted at all, even though their was a woman \"standing\" at the front.  The menu is on a digital screen near the ceiling..There was no instruction on if we were to sit down, or what...so there was a man behind us, and we told him to go ahead, since we didn't know what we wanted.  He stepped up and explained to the woman that it was his first time and he didn't know what to do.  She explained (without eye contact, as if it was a script) that you order there, and she would give him a digital thingie, and it would find him and they would deliver his food.  He looked as confused as we were.  btw, nothing friendly about any of these exchanges.
We ordered the hummus, the artichoke dip, and shared a salmon salad, and a glass of wine each.
Food came out quick.  The manager (I later learned) Patrick, brought out food.  No plates though to use.  He went back to the table in the middle of the establishment and was doing whatever on his cell phone.  After about 5 or so minutes the girl from the front came by to see if everything was ok..we told her that it was ok.  We asked for plates..3..One to split the salad, and one each for the appetizers..she seemed a bit miffed, but whatever...Mind you, there was one other customer in this huge place.  I explained to this girl that I saw the opening on the news in February, and wanted to support it because they use local farms.  I asked her which ones did they use...Very very confused girl, says that she will ask.  About 15 minutes later, Patrick came by to answer and inquire about our question.  He seems a little confused by the question too..(both of these employees were specifically moved from Utah with this company to Arizona)  he tells me Sysco and
trying to bring on  Shamrock farms...Okay!!!  hmmmm...
He asked what our experience was...so we felt that he wanted to know.  We explained that we were not greeted or explained how the operation went.  He quickly spouted back that the cashier is to greet everyone and hand them a menu..I told him that it was an epic fail for us, and that if she didn't do it to us or the man behind us, then there probably were 10 more people that it happened to today...He became very defensive and said \"nope, there absolutely had not been 10 people that it happened to today!\"  Okay, Patrick darling...standing up for your staff is admirable, but when you ask your guests what there experience is and they tell you...take the information and do what you want...Defense is bad form.
The food:  Salmon was good.  Salad was bland and very small for the $12.50 price..bland and minimal dressing.  Artichoke dip was so salty, we didn't eat it, nor did they take it off the bill.  The hummus was completely inedible...disgusting quite honestly.  
We decided to order another glass of wine..we motioned Patrick.  When ordering the glasses of wine, he asked if we had an open tab.  Really?  We were the only one's there...We just wanted a glass of wine.  He said that he needed a card to open a tab.  Okay?!  
At the end, the cashier girl and bakery girl came to our table (clearly because Patrick had spoken to them about our discussion)  They asked how everything was...we said it was okay, but not great.  We began speaking to them about where they were from, and how they liked working there...They were not excited.  They were nice enough...We left, and left all of the food...they asked if we wanted a box...and we said \"no\". 
We soo very much wanted this to be a good experience...Close to home, the types of food we like to eat, etc.
Will never ever go back.  Patrick explained how the owners had only been down once, he was the 4th manager in 4 months..  He explained that no advertising has been done, which is why they were so slow...yeah right...
Unfortunately, this place will be closed soon.  Sure hope something delish and properly managed goes into it.."}
{"text":"My group and I went here 10 minutes before they were about to switch over from breakfast to lunch. I was a little thrown off when the employee who was taking orders at the front of the restaurant told us we would have to choose between breakfast and lunch and we all had to make the same decision. Apparently they sanitize the grill when they make the switch but I guess I've never experienced this before. Why couldn't those who wanted breakfast order and then those who wanted lunch order 10 minutes later?  Anyway, we all chose breakfast.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Eggs Florentine (poached eggs, broiled tomatoes, saut√©ed spinach, and grilled ham, layered on an English muffin and topped with hollandaise sauce paired with rosemary grilled potatoes) without broiled tomatoes. When the food came out, there were no broiled tomatoes, which was good, but they forgot to give both of us the grilled ham and unfortunately I didn't realize it until the end of the meal. I brought it up to the people I was with but they didn't agree that the dish was supposed to include ham. So, I just checked the menu right now and saw that I was right. In addition, I did not enjoy the saut√©ed spinach so I took it off, leaving only a poached egg on top of an English muffin. The egg was overcooked too and there wasn't much hollandaise sauce on top. The rosemary potatoes were cold so I didn't enjoy those either. I did however try my friend's Lemon Blueberry Pancakes topped with buttermilk syrup and berries and that was very good. I like that the portions are small, but it's a bit on the expensive side considering the portions aren't as large as most restaurants. The staff was nice but they seemed inexperienced."}
{"text":"Amazing food here....we had the steak tacos and the salmon. The presentation of the food is great and the taste is even greater. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I recommend this healthy eating restaurant to everyone.

{"text":"It feels good to eat at a place that supports clean, healthy eating.  They have items that are vegan, or gluten-free, and each dish we have tried has been very tasty, often blending new flavors together.  The food is consistently good.  Not only do they change up the menu to include specials or seasonal items, but they also have some favorite comfort foods and old meat-and-potato stand-by's as well - often with a bit of a twist.  If you are a \"foodie\" and love trying well-presented/plated variety of flavors, freshness and just-right portions, this is the place for you.  (The Coconut Curry Chicken is one of my favorites.)  We also love their teas.  The service has always been friendly, attentive, and fast.  The staff appear to enjoy working there.  It shows.  The environment is clean, somewhat modern and casual, so the gourmet food and good service are a pleasant twist as well.  (So nice to eat out and not get ill.)    We love this place!"}
{"text":"Got the black bean ravioli and it was good, the tomato bisque was amazing! Cute place with a clean atmosphere. I will for sure go back."}
{"text":"I have to say it - a lot of the other reviewers are morons. 2 stars because despite great food someone mopped the floor. Gimme a break. Other people saying $10 is too pricey. Get into your time machine and go back to the 1950's then. 

The portions were surprisingly large considering the low price. The pesto chicken flatbread was delicious! All the ingredients were fresh and quality. The same can be said for the salads. Going back this weekend to try the breakfast. 

The staff was friendly and the dining room was very clean. Don't let a few dummies dissuade you!!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and loved it. We'd heard about BlueLemon in other cities and were eager to try it out. 

It's a sit down place but you order at the counter and they deliver to the table. It has the prices of good fast food with the ambience of a hip restaurant. Lots of menu choices and full bar. Has some nice high tech touches. 

Really good, fresh food. Prices are almost too good to be true for what u get. Eggs Florentine for $8!  It's a fun, clean ambiance. Definitely a unique dining formula that's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I tried so hard to like this place but the food--at least what I ordered--just wasn't very good.  I got the artichoke spinach cheese dip which came with flatbread and fresh cut veggies.  Sadly, the veggies (alone) were my favorite part.  A previous Yelper mentioned the tomato bisque as being something to try and I was super disappointed--it was just meh.  Wildflower and Cafe Zupas soups put it to shame.

Good things?  The restaurant itself is stunning--all brand new.  Lots of attentive servers=great service.  Fancy soda machines.  Decent prices.  The smoothie bar looked cute.  Ugh!  I feel like I'm fishing here...

I think I will be back again to see if I just had a bout of horrible ordering.  The breakfast menu did look promising."}
{"text":"Well, I have to agree with most of the reviews below.  I expected more.  1st time was for lunch.  Pricey for what you got with average taste.  2nd time was breakfast and I felt it was a little better and I did like their coffee.  3rd time was just for coffee with friends.   It was about 9pm and the place was filthy.  I had to wipe down my own table because the workers were too busy talking and the one girl was busy rubbing another workers back!!  I have noticed each time that management needs help in teaching employees about customer service.  I will probably go back for convvenience but without any expectations."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere super friendly! Only tried the mushroom flatbread would have been great but would have liked a more cracker crust. Will definitely be back everything looked great on menu!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for lunch. With my Celiacs and how picky everyone else is, we were struggling. Then we came here! And they have tons of Gf items! I got the coconut curry chicken, and it was nothing short of AMAZING! Especially being Gluten free, NO WAY! The flavors were so intense and unique! The strawberry basil frozen lemonade was equally wonderful.
And I didn't have that disgustingly full feeling after. Well until I ate the flourless cake, it was intensely rich, but again, amazing!
The service was also great, the girls were very friendly. 
It's a bit expensive but you're getting what you pay for! 
Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices! We also enjoyed the ambience. The reason I am only giving this place two stars is that they decided to mop all of the floors before the restaurant was closed. This process began with them splashing puddles of water on the slick concrete floor (including the entrance/exit walkway) in preparation for mopping. My daughter slipped and hurt her hand and hip. 

When we complained to the manager she explained that since they were having a slow night they wanted to get a jumpstart on cleaning up so staff could leave. Fair enough, but very dangerous. Management may want to reconsider their closing policies and saying mopping high traffic areas for when there are no customers present."}
{"text":"seriously people they just opened they are bound to have a couple of bad nights! I have been there twice now and yes my service was slower than i like the 1st night however the food was awesome! tell me where else can you get a fresh piece of salmon cooked perfectly in this town for 14 bucks. Braised short rib was also good. My 2nd time we had tacos, i had the carne asada and they were good but my wife had the seafood tacos and they were the best i ever tasted period. i suggest wait a week or two and try again, this place has great potential for good food at reasonable prices."}
