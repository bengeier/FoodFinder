{"text":"Stopped by brews brothers.   The beer selection is great!   On the negative side,  the place is very loud!  Deafeningly loud.  They need to do something to deaden the sound.   Also bright as day at 8 pm. Way too bright.   Good for beer,  not good for atmosphere."}
{"text":"We walked in and it seemed nice. However the waitress was probably the most rude person I have ever encountered. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"So I am always looking for good bar food.  I don't really like to drink but I love a good hamburger and fried appetizer which pretty much defines bar food in Madison, Wisconsin.  As my search continues to find new and delicious burgers my husband and I decided to check out Mr. Brews Taphouse a little late on a Friday night.  We arrived at this location around 10:00pm to  find it full but not crowded.  It has a nice sports bar atmosphere and it was noisy but not to the point that we couldn't have a calm conversation.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese burger and the Kentucky Bourbon burger with all the fixins as well as a side of the Pub chips.  The burger were both tasty and well done, however the Kentucky Burbon burger was a favorite with a bourbon sauce mayo and a generous portion of bacon.  The pub chips were topped with a very generous portion of delicious beer cheese sauce, bacon bits and scallions.  All in all we had so much food we could barley finish it and all of this along with the beer my husband ordered came to about $25 too (a little less than we usually pay for something similar  at other restaurants in Madison).  I will warn you that the menu is pretty much limited to cheese curds, burgers (including a couple burger alternatives like black bean patties and a turkey burger), fries and chips, and a single salad choice, so if you need more choices than that, this wouldn't be the restaurant for you.  That being said we absolutely loved it and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and tons of beer options.  A must stop. The service was first rate and great music."}
{"text":"I was at the Wanakee store and had to listen to this guy swearing using the f bomb and many other swear words. The staff did a Great job to stop this unacceptable behavior. Personally I would have kicked him out! The food was great, service was great and the place was packed all night!! I am going back."}
{"text":"Had take foe here a fee weeks ago. Burger was great. Bun was fresh and meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare. 

Fries on the other had were a different story. I had the fresh cut fries and they were undercooked to my likening. 

Next time I go back ill either order the shoestring fries or get the fresh cut ones again but request they be cooked well done."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a Sunday night.  The atmosphere was great, the crowd was great, the tables were clean, and the food was good.  I had the mac and cheese burger and my companion had the Sun's Up burger (the one with the egg).  Our meals were quickly delivered to the table and delicious.  

The first impression of our server was that she was a nice person.  It was disturbing that we heard her address other patrons as sir and ma'am and used a formal and professional voice.  When she spoke at our table she changed her voice (tone and inflection) to sound more \"black\" and used popular slang terminology.  We were blatantly treated differently.  

I did not want to drink more than one beer and the server called me a wet rag, no fun, and rudely chided me for choosing to drink less.  My companion ordered a drink and was told \"we kicked that off last night\", we were unfamiliar with this term and the server rudely explained that it meant they were out, then said \"no mas, do you understand when I say it like that?\"  

The company webpage said all food was 10% off on Sundays, but that was not reflected on our bill.  

The food, cleanliness and atmosphere were stellar.  But our server really ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and I really liked the way they organized the beer list on their menu. Burgers were alright- the ragin' Cajun burger had great flavor, definitely needs the jalepenos as recommended on the menu. The Slaw Burger was not very good; the idea of it is unique, but poor follow through. The BBQ sauce with the slaw is not complimentary with the burger. Overall relaxed atmosphere with plenty of TVs (great place for March Madness), but beware if you go with a big group, because space is limited."}
{"text":"This was the first time we've been to Mr. Brews. My only complaint is the food. The staff was very friendly and did an excellent job. Everything seemed to be nice and clean including the restrooms. It is a really nice BAR. And that is where I would leave it. Good place to drink. Not eat. The burgers are small for the price and had nooooooo flavor. They looked and smelled great. But talk about a HUGE letdown with that first bite.... So, I had ordered their peanut butter bacon burger that had habenero jack. I even had them throw on an extra patty with fried and raw onion. This SHOULD have been amazing with all these strong flavored ingredients which marry perfectly together. Nope....all I could taste was the bun and that disgusting exceptionally low grade peanut butter. The 2 burger patties were just there for the ride...could barely taste them even after I salted/peppered the heck out of them. I even had my girlfriend try it just to make sure I wasn't having some type of medical issue that had caused me to start losing my sense of taste. Nope. She made the same face I did and said the same thing. Her burger was the same deal. So these burgers would be great after you pound down about 8 drinks. Sober...not so much. Then there are their homemade fries. These qualified as the worst fries I have EVER eaten. By all rights they SHOULD have been some of the best. Fresh cut and coated with garlic parm. How could you go wrong? Right? Well I got a small basket of these soggy/mooshy and limp thin potato strip that were heavily coated in a blatantly obvious cheap or generic garlic parm powder. It was hard to eat them. The cooks did not know that the fresh cut potatoes MUST be rinsed off to remove the starch before frying to achieve a crisp fry. They had never heard that. Really??? That's basic 101 stuff. Also they obviously do not season the burgers at any point during the cooking process to avoid producing beef that has less flavor than a sea sponge. Again, that's a basic 101 deal. Again...Really??? Me: I am 44 years old and have been cooking since I was 3. I have literally eaten my way around our entire country. And many of my close friends are trained professional chefs that I cook with frequently. So, trust me when I say this boy can cook.  Bottom line: Service and atmosphere  - great! Bar/drinks - really good. Food - go get some gas station sushi instead. You'll be happier. Thank you for reading my exceptionally long rant/review. Have a great day."}
{"text":"I'll be back.  This is a bar, they have a ton of beer. 48+ taps.  It is the sole reason you should go to this place.  Got a burger, it was decent, bar food type burger-nothing fancy.

$3.50 pints during happy hour is amazing.

However...

It is brighter than the sun in that place, turn your lights down.
My clothes kind of smell like fry oil.  Does this place have ventilation?

I will be back, most likely for happy hour.  A couple beers and a burger are a very good bargain here."}
{"text":"If you have any interest in beer you have to give this place a chance... the tap beer selection is extensive, I would say 50 different types of beer.  Prices range anywhere from $5 to 9 bucks depending on selection and size(pint or 20oz). Their happy hour seems like a good deal, all pints $3.50 from 4-7. Don't know about any happy hour food deals. My guest and I both ordered burgers...average sums up the food. Everything is fresh from the fresh cut fries or chips to the burger. I asked for a medium cooked burger...you know pink...when it came out I could tell it was not medium. After a few bites...yea it's well done. I'm going to check this place out for happy hour for sure....as for the food they might get one more chance, there's better places for burgers(see: tony franks) in madison in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was the second Mr brews that i visited in the past week and the experiences were very different. While the Waunakee bar was organized, the burgers were grilled well, and the staff quick to give service, this  mr. Brews was a bad experience. I felt like we were in a frat house with the music blaring out of a pair of cheap speakers. The servers were slow to take our order and seemed confused about how to do their jobs (lack of training?). The burger didn't seem the same as the waunakee bar, and the fries were Luke warm, and should have been sent back. 
I doubt that I will stop back here, instead, I'll just stop at wallgreens and buy a 6 pack and make my own burger. Less expensive and a better experience."}
{"text":"Many options of brews on tap! Each one unique! Delicious burgers and fresh cut fries!"}
{"text":"We really like the burgers.  They always have a special one that is unique and normally delicious.  My favorite thing on the menu are the pub fries.  Can't go wrong with the bacon flavor and the sauce is really good.  Great beer selection.  Bar isn't fancy but a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Pretty good and very reasonable prices. We had a 9 person order and one of the orders was late for 5 min and the restaurant gave her a discount. The shoestring fries were great and the curds were decent."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger  was great.  Beer was cold. Service was good even though busy.  Nice place to watch some sports."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive...beer selection was incredible and the food was delicious. 

Negative - the reviews about poor service are not off day occurrences. There was one good server. The remainder of the staff had absolutely no desire to serve customers. I grew up working in the service industry and can spot poor servers in an instant! I kept looking for John Taferty to walk in. When you sit at the bar a server should not stand in front of you and ignore you! 

We would definitely go back because the beer and food were good!"}
{"text":"The food was good but my order was wrong, I had to go inside to get my own napkins and salt and pepper seeing as there were none on my table.
All the other patrons got a tray with salt, pepper, catsup, mustard and napkins but I guess my table didn't deserve similar treatment. 
I guess you have to be a regular here to get good service.
Finish eating, leave, never return!
I do not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Beer selection was also good.  Food very bad.  Wife's burger was waay undercooked which is hard to understand since they use an \"automatic grill\" which cooks to medium well.  In short, stop in for a beer but skip the food."}
{"text":"The guy at the door tonight was very sweet and called us all by name. Our waitress hannah was very patient and friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I've tried almost every burger from them, including a few of their monthly specials, and I've never been disappointed.  Their beer list is constantly changing and there's plenty to choose from.  The fries are okay, not the best, but some of their dipping sauces and seasonings are really good with them (beer cheese!)."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend for the first time. They only have fries and burgers, which was a little disappointing, but what can you expect when you come to a bar/pub?! Regardless, the burger I ordered was very good. The beer selection was excellent - several to choose from! Ayme was our waitress and she provided nothing but excellent opinions on beers! If you like blonde beer try the lips of faith by cigar city, and for darker beer drinkers try Tyranena Rockys Revenge. Decently priced! A flight of four beers (your choice) of seven ounces for only $8 is a steal, and the beers are great! Toward the end of the night they got short staffed so service took longer than usual, but I understand things come up!
Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this great pub tonight.  Holy cow there were 48 diff beers on tap.  My husband and I dont really drink beer but the bartender was great.  He let us try some samples.  We decided to order food.  The menu was small but had a great choice of burgers.  I had a Sunny side up.  Fried egg on it.  I loved it.  It was perfect.  My husband had a Kentucky Bourbon burger.  He loved it as well."}
{"text":"Decided to try Brews Brothers after hearing rave reviews among my coworkers. My expectations were surpassed !! The selection of 48 beers is incredible. The staff was knowledgeable in providing suggestions on selecting a brew from the many choices. The Rajun' Cajun burger with fresh cut fries was my dining selection. It was the most flavorful, juicy burger I've ever tasted! The fries were delicious - perfectly cooked and seasoned. I was also very pleased with the quick service and friendly staff. The atmosphere is enjoyable and my overall experience has me anxious to go back!! With Verona opening soon and an outdoor patio coming to Junction Rd it will definitely be my go to place."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite spots now! So here is the thing that everybody needs to know about Brews Brothers or what I want you to know... When you think of Brew Brothers, don't think gourmet meal or anything. 

Think, awesome burger and great beer with your friends after work and just letting the aches and pains of the day run through you like your 20oz beer does. Now for Wisconsinites, here is why it is fantastic; BEER. Beer, beer and more beer. There are so many beer choices and GOOD beer choices that it takes me literally 5-10 minutes to decide. It's cheap, plentiful, and delicious and there is a beer there for everybody (including cider for those not bold enough). The food is better than I expected and REALLY good for a place, that I like to call, \"a dive-chain.\" What do you mean Colin?! You're not making any sense! Well I mean, Brews Brothers is in fact a chain. It's not a LARGE chain, with only two locations, but in the sense of the word it is. 

Now the reason I call it a dive-chain is because it really isn't taking itself too seriously. They really make you feel hey, grab a couple beers, have a burger, laugh with your friends, and we'll see you next week. They exhibit their beers in front of you as you walk up to the bar as if it were a museum or parade of beer and it is something to be marveled at. So many beer taps striving for your attention. The greasy smell of burgers attacking your nose urging you to have one. It is simply a relaxing place to go. Staff? INCREDIBLY friendly and really make you feel like a regular. Now for those who know my posts etc. They know I love it when a place makes you feel as though you've never left and thats exactly how they make you feel. 

Now I REALLY really want to give this 5 stars but there are two big things that are nagging me. The first is the location, it is in sort of an odd place which is in between a sub shop and salad shop with a Yoga studio upstairs in a strip mall. It would be great if they were lucky enough to have a stand alone building but, such is life. The second is that I feel in this age and in Madison, even a beer bar needs to offer some liquor. I have had friends join me at this wonderful spot to be really disappointed that they didn't offer any sort of liquor. They settled for cider (simply because they don't drink beer) which is crazy to most but I understood it.\

Simply put by their own slogan (on the back of their shirts, and yes, one that I bought...) \"Brews Brothers: Where good people drink good beer\""}
{"text":"Loved this place! Was in the Madison area for a wedding. The beer selection was incredible. A little disappointing, however, that they had run out of a lot of selections I wanted to try. But my burger was incredible. Luke was amazing!"}
{"text":"I went and this was my first time I wanted a basic turkey cheese burger however their turkey burger option was more unique. I asked the waitress if I could have the classic cheeseburger but with turkey and they could.  I was amazed how tasty it was.  I was surely not disappointed it was so delicious.  The pun grub chips were amazing as well.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"The 2 for 1 burger coupon brought us in. The delicious burgers and fries will bring us back! Burgers are all served a la carte at about $6 to $7 dollars each. My husband ordered a basic cheeseburger and was singing it's praises until he tried mine- the weekly special Kentucky Bourbon burger, which he declared blew his cheeseburger out of the water. SO FLAVORFUL! Brews Brothers- make this one a full time menu item!!
We ordered the family size fries to split ($4.99) and the portion was more than enough for two people. Fries are FRESH- you can watch the cooks cut up the potatoes! We added a cup of beer cheese sauce for dipping- YUM! 
The variety of beers on tap was great- but we both agreed that there wasn't anything TOO unique (but since the tap seems to change frequently, I'm looking forward to seeing an updated list next time we visit). 
We were in on a Friday night, and it was nearly a full house. But we ordered and had our food within 10 minutes or less! 

One thing I will mention is that we were dining with our 3 month old baby and brought her in in her car seat (Hey- new parents need to get out every once in awhile!). There is only one \"regular\" table. The rest of the seating is high top tables and at the bar. So not necessarily baby, kid or wheelchair friendly. 
We'll definitely be back- but will likely arrange a babysitter, or come on a less busy weeknight."}
{"text":"I sent an e-mail to the manager after this incident. He met with me and a friend - and things do seem to be improving service wise. The food quality has always been good. I am bumping this up from one star to three."}
{"text":"Burgers were fantastic. It was hard to pick which one to try. Go here for more of a townie vibe."}
{"text":"I was greeted with a smile and a welcome when I walked through the door. This is why I love supporting locally owned businesses. 

I ordered wings and a burger - I was hangry! I was not disappointed. The wings where gone within minutes - yes, that good. The burger was juicy and flavorful - a bonus that you can see them cook it from your seat."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon service was friendly but our order of a California burger came out as regular cheeseburger and our fries were cold and soggy. Both of us said we would never be back.  Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a bar with great taps and a laid-back atmosphere. Even though it's in a new strip mall, it's still got a bit of character and a good bar keep. Two mugs up."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds I've ever had! The batter was light and crispy and not overly greasy. Overall amazing taste! The ranch served with them was phenomenal. The Kentucky Bourbon burger and the Classic cheeseburger were amazing!! Excellent food. Didn't realize it was a beer and wine only place. I had water. My boyfriend had the New Glarus Scream Double IPA and said it was very good.  Excellent choice for burgers and a beer. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had a Mushroom n' swiss burger, which was decent.  It was a good sized burger, still nice and juicy, with a healthy serving of mushrooms.  That is the high point.  The low points are service and quality control.  With the burger, I ordered \"hand cut\" fries.  First, they were cold, and the oil they were cooked in became filmy.  When I pointed out that they were barely luke warm, the server had not been trained at all in what to do about that.  Finally, after giving some prompts, he finally offered to get another order. I declined on that one, mostly because of the people I was with and not wanting to wait.  Once the food was served, there was no follow-up to see how things tasted or to see if we needed anything else.  

The cooks and wait staff need to pay a lot more attention to making sure that the food is served hot.  There is also a big need for staff training.  I may try this one again because the burger was tasty, but I'll probably wait to see if there are any other reviews indicating improvements to the service and quality control problems.  

Also, the high chairs and high tables are not really comfortable.  The holders used for napkins and condiments are also very tall, and the menus are stuffed on top of them.  It's very hard to see others at the table with such large barriers in the way."}
{"text":"The place trys harder than the rest when it comes to beer selection, some very wide ranging brews across the library of beer. Also the cajin burger was very good."}
{"text":"Solid food, great beer selection, easy to get too. Had a chicken sandwich that tasted great. The facilities are about 5/10. Parking isn't to bad considering the neighboring businesses. They have wifi but it's got a password and I never bothered to ask for it. All in all I'd say its a great place well lite from both sides of the building to know where it is as well"}
{"text":"Awesome craft beers on tap and burgers at Brews Brothers! Fortunately walking distance to my house. 48 on tap!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good service, excellent draft beer selection, very tasty and fresh burgers and fries, several TVs

Cons: Burger patties are quite small (4.5 oz, too small for the bun they're served in), Beer prices are high ($7.00 for a 16 oz Satisfaction Jacksin) and they make no attempt to inform the customer of the varying prices on their draft list, Food selection is extremely limited (almost exclusively burgers and fries, no dessert options), Nothing to indicate the seating policy (is it seat yourself, or wait to be seated? Hint: it's the former.)

Overall, we enjoyed our visit. While my \"cons\" list is longer than my \"pros\" list, I weight the \"pros\" more heavily. Hence the four-star rating. We will be back."}
{"text":"Obviously great beer selection. I had two of four available nitro taps unfortunately nothing special out of all 4 nitros I've had each many times. My waiter was a moron. I'm pulling for the guy but clearly he's a loser. And we're raising our eyebrows at 'im and I'm trying to cut him some slack. But he messes up my order. I clearly asked for my sandwich to be the chicken version and he clearly acknowledged it. But between him taking our order and placing our order he forgets. I don't eat beef for a couple of reasons. But I got a beef burger.  Also never once did he come by for the follow up. No \"how is everything?\".  Everything else was fine but c'mon dude. Also- the parking lot sucks and only one urinal in a beer place. Other Mr Brews are better. This particular one I won't vouch for."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Saturday evening.

I ordered the Rajun Cajun Burger substituted the pepper jack with the habenero jack and a side of amazing sweet potato fries.

If you want spicy be sure to order it with jalapenos. It was good but messy.

My boyfriend ordered the Slaw Burger which was pretty good as well.

The waitress/bartender in the blue shirt appeared very exhausted and did not smile much.

The waitress/bartender in the purple shirt was professional, friendly and very helpful.

I love the set up and atmosphere. Casual bar restaurant, classy yet family-friendly.

We'll definitely be back to try all the menu items!

***The buns could definitely be better."}
{"text":"Beer and burgers, a little creative on the burgers. Fair selection of beers. What do you really want from a strip mall joint"}
{"text":"I went to Madison to audition for the Ballet Company there, and was a little let down (given that the company is across town, on the old-deserted side).  When we came to the more hoppin' side, we came here to eat.

I thought the service was astounding: friendly and cute waitress, and was very welcoming.  The burger + fries were so delicious, I couldn't believe it.  I mean, if I had the money I would come here from Chicago.  I suggest this for everyone that passes by or lives in Madison.  You will not be disappointed one bit.  Plus, it's super cute inside!"}
{"text":"Three stars is a bit harsh, but I can't quite go for four stars. The food is decent, but for the price I think the fires should come with the burger. That being said, draft beers were a good price, especially for the happy hour.

Super friendly and knowledgable staff when I was here, and they had a great playlist going (I know, minor point thing and you can't please everyone but I was impressed).

I do wish the beer selection here was more exotic, meaning I wish they offered more options that I can't find at a grocery store. Feels like to be a taphouse in this day and age, at least half of your offerings should be something you can't easily find locally. I will say there were a good number of Wisconsin craft brews, which is nice if that's what you're going for."}
{"text":"Tried the California burger, it was good.  The fries can have added seasoning.  I added Parmesan Garlic.  Lots on tap, I don't think any tap repeats itself so if you want variety for beer, here's where it's at."}
{"text":"Bumping this up one star. Since my last review the service has gotten a little better and their tap selection has gotten MUCH better. Surprisingly good assortment of beers. 

The food is still just ok, but it's good enough for something within walking distance of the office. 

The grease trap smell appears to be solved."}
{"text":"Little bit busy, but was well taken care of.  Beer selection was great, bartender complemented every selection. Only problem was it is a burger place too, and too much bun for the burger.  Bun bites are bad. Give me more meat."}
{"text":"The Food was okay.  It's a bar.  It's better if you are a beer drinker.  I am not a beer drinker.   I had a black bean burger,  it was most likely a morningstar farms one.   Does that constitute a 1.99 additional charge?  I'm not sure.  

The service was spotty, but at least we got a refill on the drinks when our check got dropped off."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch to check the place out. Have driven by several times and never had the chance to sit in until today. 

It was quiet due to being Monday. First impression- very clean! Also, a ton of beer taps with a very wide selection and variety. 

Food menu was a bit shallow. Diversity of burgers but not much else to speak of. Wasn't surprised... went there to get a burger and a beer. I got the California burger and it was super tasty! The fries left something to be desired. I've had tastier potato chips. 

Staff were very friendly! Will drop in again."}
{"text":"I've only ever come here for drinks with coworkers, so I can't comment on the food. However, service has always been good and the waiters all seem knowledgeable about the beer and have been able to suggest beers I would like."}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, my food came out quite fast. Service was great. Good beer selection and the burger was great. I'll be back for sure. I had the California burger and cajun seasoned chips. I would recommend this to anyone. The menu isn't very big, but it doesn't need to be. They are good at what they do."}
{"text":"i've worked in the service industry for years, i started coctailing when i was 17 at a restruant/bar at Pier 39 ...so let me tell you, the waitress that served us the night we went IS GOING TO KILL THIS PLACE!  SHE IS GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE ME NEVER COME BACK. not being a huge beer consumer, and new to wisconsin, we were not sure which beer to order, but excited to try something new.  So what do you do when you don't know what to order; you ask the waiter/waitress what they recommend. so we did. and guess what she said...and i am not joking, \"i'm not even 21, i don't know\"- not  well whats popular is .....blah blah blah, or our biggest seller of IPA is....or if you like sweet try our cider or whatever. OMG you are WORKING AT A PLACE CALLED\" BREW BROTHERS\"!! a place that has a gazillon beers on tap. the beer menu is more extensive than the burger menu! LEARN IT!  GIVE A BETTER ANSWER. also, she never came back to our table to ask if we wanted more water or more beer. hello! UPSALE! it's your job to make money for the owner and make an awesome tip by keeping the customer full and happy.  
as for the burger:
the burger was good, home made patty on sweet hawaiian bread. yum. wouldn't say it was amazing..but it was really good. this place is more straight burgers and fries. their menu isn't extensive, but what they do offer is pretty good.

so i shared my feedback w/ the friend that recommended me to this place (she's been there 2ce) and told her about the waitress that was completely unhelpful, and she said that the first time she went, she had a great waitress that knew her beer, and the second time she went, sounds like she had the same waitress i had because she said the same line was used \"I'm not 21 years old, i don't know\". -unacceptable. i wanted to call the manager..but i figured if they care about their NEW business, they'll start reading the reviews on yelp. at least you can only hope."}
{"text":"Yes, this place serves \"bar\" food, but it is GOOD bar food!

I ate lunch here with my husband, and it was super tasty. The restaurant makes its own homemade, freshly cut fries, and gives you various spice options for your basket of fries. And they were delicious!

I also ate a burger (cheeseburger with a turkey patty), which was super yummy.

Beer lovers will be in heaven in this place. I'm not a beer lover, but I was still in heaven because of the food.

I will be going back, and I would definitely recommend Brews Brothers."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. But, I just can't.  I felt like they were a mediocre burger place with a great beer list.

When I walked in, I just stood there. As a first time patron, I had no idea that I was supposed to seat myself. There is no giving you an indication of this \"seat yourself\" policy. I found a table, but it had no menus. At first I did not find this strange until I realized that all of the other tables had menus. When you re set a table, ensuring it has menus is important. 

I ordered the bruschetta and pesto burger which was delicious!  However, the size?  5 oz. for $7.59 with no size. There was nothing about this burger that made up for the price. It was tasty but small. Sides are extra. The options are fresh cut fries, shoe string fries or sweet potato fries. After you add a side of fries to a burger, you are looking at a $10 meal. That is a little crazy for what you get.

My dinner companion ordered the mac and cheese with bacon burger. The components were delicious (of course I sneaked a bite), but the burger itself was not great as a whole. It was dry. Maybe a cheese sauce would have helped?  

The beer menu is HUGE. There are a ton of great brews to try but otherwise, this place is just ok."}
{"text":"Ehh... service was not too friendly. Beer selection was decent, but service is huge in these establishments and this place lacked enthusiasm and energy..."}
{"text":"Found this place driving by. Stopped in for a beer and burger. We enjoyed the atmosphere and beer selections. The fries were sliced fresh prior to cooking. They were a little overcooked for my liking otherwise I would have given a 5,  my burger was great. We will return. Great service too."}
{"text":"Burgers are good and the fries selection is okay. What you really should be coming here for is the 40 beers on tap that they change out regularly. Service is good and the owners are really nice."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to think when we walked in but the longer we hung out the more I really liked this place! Ive never seen so many beer options in one place.  I had a delicious cheeseburger and a yummy beer.  Quick service with a really friendly bartender.  Curious to see what type of crowd they draw on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighborhood. These guys know their niche and execute it well. 48 taps ranging from root beer and hard cider to a full selection of beers light to dark. National brands and a nice selection of local craft brews. Nice selection of burgers. Tried the California Burger, awesome but a bit messy! Love that they season the fries and homemade chips. Open kitchen so if you want to watch your food being made sit at the bar. Just watch out as parking can be a bit tight."}
{"text":"As a lover of beer, this is a perfect place.  There are 47 different beers on tap and they do free samples of a few for you!!  Food was pretty good, you can watch your fries come from a potato, which means they can't be much more fresh.  Good service, and a nice atmosphere!!  I will return!  

Oh and they have a loyalty program, which means I have an extra incentive to come back!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon, so we sat right away and had our food pretty fast. We had the Kentucky thing and the jalapeno burgers, so good!!! We wish we lived closer because we would come back. 

The beer list is impressive, I felt awful for not ordering anything beer! Tell you friends about this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for burgers, beer, and sports. They have a ton of beers on tap, many of which are tough to find other places. I've had a few different burgers and they've all been very good. The fries are also delicious with a bunch of different seasoning options (parmesan garlic is my favorite). There are also a TV's located all around the bar and seating area. I highly recommend this place for food or drinks."}
{"text":"We walked in an were immediately greeted by the bartender, and directed to sit wherever we would like. Sunday, 1pm, so lot's of football games on the flat screen TV's. Nice big windows, so lots of natural light in the place. And WOW, what an amazing beer selection!! More than 50 taps! Plus 1919 Rootbeer on tap - I got a 20 ouncer, no ice. Very yummy. Not sure why the previous reviewer didn't see this on the menu when he was complaining about not having any options besides beer. 

Also quite perplexed why the previous reviewer was hating on the burgers. Ours were fantastic!! The hubby got the blue cheese and bacon burger - he was quite impressed. Perfectly cooked, not too much chz - just right, so that you can still taste the burger. I got the veggie burger, California style with guacamole and roasted red pepper sauce. Really good!! It was a black bean burger - I think I saw some corn in it too. Nice and crispy on the outside of the patty, not too mushy inside like some bean burgers are. Both were on the same type of bun - old school, nice soft, melt in your mouth variety, which we thought worked perfectly with our burgers. Very impressive to watch the cooks grab potatoes right in front of us, and cut them to order! We got an order of fries (salt and pepper), and chips (parmesan garlic) - both were super yummy. The fries were our favorite. They have a number of flavorings options, but they are just powdered spice mixes - tasty, but we preferred the straight up salt n pepper. Someone called in and ordered three California burger , fries and chips for takeout while we were there - happy to note that they didn't pack them in styrofoam! Foil and paper bags. 

We don't just hand out 5 star reviews, but can't think of one negative thing to say. Staff was super friendly and helpful, ambiance pleasant, food fantastic, and the beer selection out of this world. Plus, close to home and not too crowded (YET, until the word gets out!). We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"What can I say? My husband and I absolutely LOVE Mr. Brews! The beer selection is ever-changing and quite frankly awesome. The burgers are always done to our liking, and the toppings are super unique. My favorite is the Weston burger, but there are many others that I want to try. The sweet potato fries are delicious, especially if you get them with the garlic Parmesan seasoning. Prices are very reasonable and service is always pretty quick! Great little place on the west side!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you can hide the fact that you are in a strip mall.  This is particularly true for Mr. Brews.  The interior feels rather stark and impersonal.  Yes, you have your requisite TVs, beer memorabilia, and beer lists but it lacking in charm and personality.
I was impressed with the beer list but not blown away.  We are blessed, here in Madison, to have a large number of places that have great beer lists.  I paired my beer with their common cheeseburger.  Like the interior, the burger is not memorable.  Nothing bad about it but nothing great either.  A basic burger in a basic bar.  Yawn."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money!!  I went there wanting some good burgers and good beer and while the menu looked appetizing, the food was very bland. Maybe they should change the name as Tap House is misleading. The beer selection was underwhelming and less than most bars in Madison. I know there isn't much on the far west side but there has to be better than this!?!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times - I work nearby and sometimes will get lunch here with coworkers, or stop in for a beer. This latest trip I came in solo during lunch on a Friday (today), right around 11:45 am, and sat at the bar. The place was pretty full, and you could tell they were understaffed for it, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and expected to wait my turn. However, even with this in mind, it took way too long basically every step of the way. I've worked in the service industry and I know how crazy an understaffed rush can be, but my main problem was the lack of checking in on waiting customers, and the lack of prioritization from some of the waitstaff - food sat in the window for five minutes at one point. The food is always good and I like the beer selection, but y'all gotta beef up your lunch staff or the business people coming in are going to miss meetings and get pissy. 

Overall, food is good, staff is friendly, but if they're busy make sure you're not in a hurry at all."}
{"text":"Wow the selection of beers on tap is amazing. They got the classics like spotted cow and leinenkugels and ur major brewers but then they got soooo many others! There burgers are great too obviously cuz it's a burger joint. Had the Kentucky bourbon burger or something like that. Was outstanding. Definitely need to go back to try more beers and burgers. Atmosphere was great and waitstaff was attentive. Try it!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the food, as I had it for takeout that someone else ordered & picked up. 

I had the Kentucky Bourbon Classic with a veggie patty and fries. The burger really hit the spot for me, with a veggie patty that wasn't burned (a sadly common occurrence) and a sauce that reminds me very, very deeply of something I've had before but I cannot place for the life of me. It makes me want to try it again to figure out where I've had that particular flavor. I will say the $1.99 up charge for the veggie patty is a little steep, though - it appears to be pre-made, and tasty though it may be it's nothing special as far as ingredients or preparation go. 

The fries were good - nice and crispy with just enough salt; they're a better version of those that come from a certain golden-arched establishment. They offer both a side and a family-sized option and we went for the former. Brews Brothers (or now, it seems, Mr. Brew's Taphouse) definitely gave us enough fries to feed 2-4 people. 

Brews isn't going to be a revelatory experience, but I think it's a solid choice if you're seeking a burger and fries from a familiar, comfort food angle."}
{"text":"Went here last night with for supper and was pretty unimpressed. The pros were the huge beer selection, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the \"Pub Grub\" which was amazingly addictive. But all of this was far outweighed by the cons.

We sat at the bar, and the first thing I noticed was the kitchen staff opening a huge bag of pre-cut frozen french fries. Right off the bat I was a little unsettled at the fact that the cooks making my food didn't know how to cut potatoes. The lack of ability in the kitchen might have been an explanation for the redundancy in the menu. I know this is a burger joint, I wasn't expecting much more than burgers, but I didn't know it was also a barbecue place. Almost all of their burgers had BBQ sauce on them which was really unappealing and boring.

The bartender seemed to have an issue with favoritism of customers. The guys sitting next to us must have been her friends, as I overheard them chatting about her upcoming vacation plans while she was ignoring my boyfriend and I. When she finally did take our order, she must have not been too concerned about paying attention to the simplest of details, such as there were two of us there. Our order came out with just the Pub Grub and one burger. She said something about a button missing on the computer, so they didn't make my burger. This might have been an acceptable excuse if we weren't sitting within arms reach of the open kitchen. Couldn't she have just told them to make my burger? When I finally did get the burger it was really unimpressive. I can't think of any other way to describe it than lame. Thank goodness for the Pub Grub, or I would have gone home hungry."}
{"text":"This isn't as much a review as it is a Why Bother. We were excited to go and the place is open late - serves until midnight. 

But alas no stars because the menu says all burgers are cooked to 170 degrees or medium well. When I inquired as to whether we get the burgers cooked any other way the server said \"no, they are cooked on an automatic grill\". Oh and they don't have a full bar. 

Why would you have a burger joint that uses locally sourced beef and then only offer it cooked to 170 degrees. It sort of reminds me of airport food. $8 Hamburger - well done.  We drove across the street to Madison's best and most reliable late night spot - Eno Vino. Not a burger joint- but they always get it right. 

I concede this is an un-review. Unless you like your burgers \"medium well\" this isn't the place for you. I'm sort of baffled by this policy - have confidence in your purveyors and serve a great burger the way the customer wants it. The 170 degree policy and the automatic meat cooker is a red flag as it relates to food quality and staffs ability as it relates to food safety. 

So in reality this is a No-Star review. We didn't eat there. But there is no way to post without at least one star. Yelp needs a category for we were interested, but not that interested."}
{"text":"Great Location! Quick lunch! Love the slaw burger with cheddar fries. Looking to change it up order the pulled pork with parmesan chips. Great selection of beers. 
Everything is SO full of flavor. Staff is very friendly and happy to serve you a burger and beer! Favorite lunch spot! Craving a burger stop in and try it."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Good burgers. French fries cut to order if that's your thing. I like mine a bit crispier. Location opening closer to me in verona this year and I'll be a regular for the beer and burgers. Their expansion plan is ambitious to say the least"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I can say that this place is a-o-kay!  I have only ordered the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and I have no complaints.  The location is in a busy strip  mall with other restaurants.  There is ample parking in the back which is great!  The service is standard, you are greeted upon walking in and can be seated at the bar or bar area.  They also have a very simple straightforward menu as it is a burger and fries joint.  I like the simplicity of this place.  I am looking forward to going and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was in town for business, what a great place!!! Bartenders were great, knew there beer, and cooks, if they weren't cooking the best burger I ever tasted, they were cleaning the kitchen till it was spotless!  I highly recommend stopping in if your in the area!"}
{"text":"In town for business and decided to give this place a try. I wasn't disappointed one bit! Great selection of taps and, based on the recommendation of Damien, I had the Kentucky Bourbon burger. It was very good! Luke and Damien are a couple of cool guys as well."}
{"text":"Just ok. Lots of beer to choose from. Burgers to small for the bun size. Sides were good. Price was fair. Service was just ok. Will add more later ..."}
{"text":"First time in was today. Had the Jalapeño Popper Burger - FANTASTIC! Highly recommend.
Felt like there was a hundred taps in there. Slight exaggeration, but they had plenty of cold craft brews to choose from. Capital Oktoberfest is there now and it's GOOD.
Clean place with a very nice team. Fun people that were serious about providing a great experience.
Friday afternoon at happy hour and the place was packed. The only disappointment was that I waited so long to try this place out."}
{"text":"For what it is, Mr. Brews hits the spot. Sure it's not the most hip place, but it's reliably good. Their beer list is pretty darn good and varied. Zombie Dust, sours, and one offs mingle among WI, Michigan, California and other regional faves. If you are in the mood for a burger in this part of town, this is one of your very best bets. 1/3 lb. Herford, with a great bun and perfectly portioned toppings. Lots of interesting (pb bacon habanero!) and fresh toppings. Can sub a turkey, veggie burger or chicken breast. My go to is the chicken popper with cream cheese, jalapeño and bbq. Hubby gets the cajun, cali or or mushroom & swiss. Prices are reasonable at $7-9, but sides are extra. Fries are crispy and handcut, with your choice of seasoning.

The only downside is the average strip mall environment and weird parking lot. But lots of tv with sports."}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS!!! Mr Brews never ceases to amaze me! I get my food quick and there's always a great selection of beer to choose from. I love the fresh cut fries tossed in cajun seasoning with a side of ranch to dip it in. Kick it up, cool it down. The taps change often; something for everyone whether you like beer, ciders or wine."}
{"text":"I looked on Yelp for a place that had cheese curds.  (I was told that when in WI you must try them).  This place was close to my hotel and had cheese curds and beer!  What more could I ask for?  I arrived and everyone was friendly.  My server, Luke, brought me a sample of a wheat beer.  It was a good beer!  I ordered the cheese curds and the KY Bourbon Burger.  Both were amazing.  Serving size was large and I couldn't finish all the curds...  But I sure wanted to.  Luke checked on me a few times.  Was nice and attentive and pleasant to talk to.  The food was great and Luke made me feel welcome.  When I am back in Madison, I will be back here.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here once for dinner. We got burgers, beers, and a side of chips as well as fries. The beer selection is awesome, and I think this is a great place to come explore different brews. However, the burgers were less than mediocre. We ordered them medium and medium-rare, and both were well done. They also were small patties for the price and pretty greasy. The buns weren't anything special. Dipping sauces for the chips and fries cost extra, and no sides come with the burger. The fries and chips were good though. I'd come back for beers and chips or the pub grub (loaded chips), but probably not for burgers."}
{"text":"Used to go to the Blue Moon for delicious burgers but our last few visits have been average at best and have caused us to find a new burger joint.  There's a Brews Brothers coming to Verona, where we live, so tried the one on Junction to get a preview.  It was delicious!  I had the Slaw and BBQ burgers, which is normally not my thing, but the flavors sounded good.  And my husband had the Kentucky Bourbon.  Both of our burgers were full of flavor and cook perfectly...not too overdone.  Quality of the meat was very good.  We ordered both the cut fries (w/o seasoning) and the The handcut chips (with the Parmesan and garlic seasoning) and both were really good.  I'd recommend the parmesan and garlic season.  

Service was friendly and fast.  

I am not a beer fan so I just had the Sprecher's on tap which was creamy and yummy as always.  My husband is particular about his beer and although he opted out this time around, he mentioned a couple he wanted to try on our next visit.  Because, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Right in step with the Waunakee restaurant, this Mr. Brews was spot on.  I enjoyed the Mushroom n' Swiss so much at the other location that I had to have it again.  This time, we were smart enough to order the beer cheese dip with the pub chips.

I tried to order my burger medium rare.  Usually if a place refuses to cook it less than medium, it's an indicator that the burger has been frozen (so I've been told).  He said they cook it to medium-well in a burger press, and there's no other options.  \"Don't worry, it'll still be juicy\", he says.  Sorry - while somewhat juicy, it's not the same.  But hey, I understand.  The last one was good, this should be too.

While the restaurant was somewhat busy, the food came up fast (sure - they use a burger press...).  The burger was quite tasty.  Not quite as good as the last one I had, but still something I'd have again.  The pub chips were better this time around - not as overdone.  The beer cheese dip makes them uh-mazing!

Service was good as three different staffers checked on us for refills and to make sure everything was alright while a fourth called out to us to have a great night as we were exiting the building.  I love good customer service, and I felt welcome here.

Looking at the beer list on the wall, once again I disappointed myself by having a soda.  I was quite thirsty after a day of moving, so I was practical.  But seeing the listing for some \"Whiskey river bourbon ale\" made me whimper like someone who lost their favorite toy.  Next time, Mr. Brews... next time..."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! We just walked out. The waitress acted like she didn't want to be there, when I asked her to tell me what pumpkin beers they have, she simply pointed to the board and said \"they're right there\" and walked away. Clearly I can read, I just wanted to know what the difference was between them."}
{"text":"Pretty good cheeseburger. Toppings were fresh and the burger tasted good. Fries were good, but not worth the price. They are potatoes after all not truffles. I would suggest they up the price and include the fries.

Great beer selection no doubt. If you want a decent burger and a good beer I would try this place. Not a place to seek out from a distance, but if you are in the area I would recommend it.

The waiter was a nice guy, but not a very good waiter. Never stopped by after I received my food nor could I get a check. I had to flag him down. Maybe he was new to being a waiter.

They did have a  nice sports TV setup."}
{"text":"Mr. Brew's (formally Brew's Brothers) was a great place to watch a Badger baseketball game and try a few different beers.  With lots of TVs and 50 beers on tap, Mr. Brew's has a lot of things going on.  I also really appreciated the paper towel rolls held up by tap handles accessible everywhere.   

I only give it 3 stars however because of the food quality.  Mr. Brew's informed me that they changed their name so that they could franchise and expand out of state.  They already have spots 4 and 5 (Waunakee and State St) opening in a few months.  The quality of food made it clear that this is the priority.  There are 12 burgers to choose from, but the ingredients are cheap and the flavor is lacking.

I wish Mr. Brew would focus on a few quality spots with real quality food here instead of compromising taste to make $$."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth burgers. This place was a short walk from my hotel and I'm glad it was. Lots of awesome beers and did I mention the burger was fantastic! Fries were fresh cut and delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with the food. The burger was really dry and the special sauce overpowered and flavor that was there. If all you do is burgers then they should be awesome. The reason I still gave it 3 stars is because the tap beer selection is great! You can't always find a good beer on tap, which is how I prefer my beer served, so you usually end up with a bottle...not the same. So I will go back for a beer now and then but I will avoid the food, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"I am not the person to complain, trust me if I have a bad experience at a restaurant I ignore it and continue to go there even if it's just one thing on the menu I kinda like or it is convenient. I have been here three times now and I can say this will for sure be my last visit. Beer is great, food is decent. It is the lack of customer service that will keep me away. The wait staff that our group (3-6) has had in our three visits have been three different waiters. Same managers on duty as far as I could tell. The waiters where horrible at communicating and never gave us the time of day. Always started off good with initial order then it seems like we where on own own to flag down our waiter to get a napkin, another beer, fries that where suppose to come with the meal, your bill.....The waiters would turn around as soon as you said something and start walking as if you were done talking. Three separate waiters, three separate times, in two months!! It took almost a hour after eating to get our bill and get out the door twice. Our first time there our waiter just left to go home and we ended up asking the manager where our waiter went and he replied \"ohh she went home\". I said and she didn't tell you she had a table open of 5 guys sitting right there? He said she was really busy tonight. Anyways enough said, I could go on... The Place could be a gold mine if it had good customer service."}
{"text":"A lot of the Yelp reviews seemed to center around poor or slow service, so I sat at the bar to up my chances of getting good service.  I had a very friendly waitress who let me try 2 of their beers, since the number of choices is a little overwhelming.  The menu is pretty small and all burgers (no wraps, no salads, no appetizers), but it also works in your favor because the food arrives quickly.  I got the All-American burger with pepper jack cheese & fries.  The food is competently prepared, but nothing to get excited about.  However, if you are looking for some beer & a decent meal for less than $10, this might be your place."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, good service.  I always believe those are the pillars to a good restaurant experience and Brews Brothers hits the mark on all three.  I've been there several times over the last six months and each visit was a pleasant time.

They have an excellent selection of tap beers, with a good 5-10 of each variety and they change them often.  I recommend getting one of their flights; they're only $10 for four reasonably sized beers.  From chocolate porters, to dogfish ipas, to belgian ales, you'll find your favorites and probably enjoy sampling stuff outside of your comfort zone.  They have a brews brothers loyalty program too so you can get points towards freebies down the road.

The food choices desperately need to be expanded and improved upon, but I will give them credit in a few areas.  The potato chips are freshly skinned and seasoned, giving them a nice mixture of chewiness and crunchiness as you work your way through the basket.  The burgers are delicious, they use fresh meat from Knoche's which is a local butcher shop that has been in Madison since I was a kid and is well known for their quality.  I like that Brews Brothers gets creative here, with offerings such as jalapenos and cream cheese, cajun seasonings, slaw and bbq, and various forms of scrumptious bacon.  I think if you're getting some food, I'd recommend the burgers most of all.  Besides that, there isn't much else you even can get, aside from the pub grub which is popular but not my favorite.  It's chips with a ton of extras thrown haphazardly in the mix, almost like a loaded nachos plate.  But don't take my qualms into it if that's usually your jam, as I seem to be alone in that opinion.

Our service has routinely been friendly, welcoming us as we walk in and all happy smiles.  We've had several long conversations with staff and bartenders and they made us feel right at home with a nice down to earth attitude.  That's huge to me, I don't think you can get that kind of service at many places and it's one of the reasons Brews Brothers has quickly grown to be one of my frequent kick-back spots in Madison.  Just a great place to have a few beers, TVs to watch sports or shows, etc.  Prices are incredibly reasonable too for just about anything on the menu, usually $10 or less.

My only gripes are the menu selections I mentioned, the atmosphere, and the newer servers.  We went once or twice where the person serving didn't seem to be too aware of what was available or attentative, but it was very busy with a big sports game going on and I think the server was both new and overwhelmed.  Easily something that will improve over time and far from the norm.  The atmosphere is just a big room with TVs and tables, not a lot of decor or things to look at.  Almost feels like a spruced up room in a house somewhere.  But, where they lack in that area they make up for it everywhere else and I imagine as they get on their feet this will also improve.

Highly recommend a visit.  Just think of that long work day where you need a cold one after and some relaxation time and Brews Brothers (Mr. Brews) has got you covered"}
{"text":"Nice place out of the way. Stayed in the area and found it on Yelp. Nice selection of beers and good bar food. Hamburger was good and the cheese curds were very good, if you are in the area and want a casual nice meal with a good beer try this place"}
{"text":"I was excited to see the sign go up for this place right near my house!  Read about it online and saw a huge selection of craft tap beer (awesome) and we love a great bar burger.  Again the location is great for me, but after one experience we will never be going back!  We went on a Friday evening, about 8:30pm and grabbed a table.  After staring at the wall of beers on tap and feeling a bit overwhelmed, I asked our waitress about a few that I'd never seen (namely Goose Island's Ten Hills), to which she replied \"I really don't know anything about that beer\".  No biggie, so I tried another, same response,  Usually at a bar in Wisconsin, they generously offer a sample to you...not her.  Just stared blank faced...awesome start!  So I asked for a sample of the Goose Island, which she brought.  I liked it and ordered a full size glass....which came and was not even the same beer.  Luckily I still had the sampler at the table, which was a slightly cloudy pale ale, and my new beer was a rich toned amber.  She insisted they were the same...again, ridiculous from a beer bar.

My husband, being a dark beer lover, ordered an oatmeal stout.  The glass came and was literally over 50% foam....the worst beer pour ever, none the less from a \"brews\" bars.  Laughable, he took it up to the bar and the other waitress shook her head (clearly realizing the issue) and poured him a new one.  He re-ordered the same beer and again, a cup-o-foam was brought to the table.  

On a tip from the neighboring table, we didn't order food!  

There are PLENTY of fantastic local pubs nearby....drive past this place and go to the Village Green or Free House Pub in Middleton!!!!!!!!!"}
