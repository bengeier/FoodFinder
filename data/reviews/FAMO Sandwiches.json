{"text":"Went there with two other friends for lunch and turned out to be a terrible experience. The place was busy during lunch time with people waiting for their takeout orders so it took us some time to wait to get our orders in which was totally understandable. We waited at the table in hope of a dine-in meal. 20 minutes later one of the staff told my friend that her pulled pork burger was not available and asked her to switch to another sandwich at the same price, and she chose a chicken sandwich. 

Because of the long wait, we decided to do take out instead. With everyone else waiting in the room, we waited for almost another 30 minutes to finally get two of our orders... My friend who didn't get her order asked for a refund as we had to go back to the office but she was told that it would take longer to refund than to make her the food, so we just had to wait for a bit more. 

We got back to our office finally, then realized an order went wrong... The friend who got the chicken sandwich as a replacement got a fish sandwich, my other friend's veggie burger was all greasy with tofu falling apart... 

Were they under staff? I don't think so. They had four staff working in the kitchen plus one taking orders. It was just unprofessional. It was a very small kitchen and not a large selection of menu. Plus it was mostly for takeouts, even for dine in, it's self serviced. 

- Ridiculously long waiting time (should not be expected in a sandwich place especially during lunch time where everyone has a very limited lunch time in downtown)
- Poor service (staff not knowing the internal procedures/not apologizing for the delayed service/giving wrong orders) even I apologized more to my friends for the poor choice of restaurant.

The taste is up to standard which is where the one-star goes to but it is definitely not worth the one hour wait and it is NOT cheap at all. Their service and operations will definitely need a lot of improvements."}
{"text":"I tried almost all their sandwiches. I usually order through Foodora. It is hard to say which one is my favorite maybe lamb or tongue with French baguette! For sure, they are different from any other sandwich places in the city. The quality is the best and the sandwiches taste like heaven."}
{"text":"First time trying FAMO, I ordered takeout using Ritual. Didn't know what to expect, but the decor was modern and inviting. Ended up eating in, which they were really nice about (unpacked my take-out meal and put it on a tray for me).

I had the Cheek & Bun Sandwich with the beet slaw on the side. Both were tasty - the meat was juicy and flavourful, and the baguette had just the right amount of crunch.

Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and friendly staff,  tried the six (braised beef tongue with truffle mayo) and it was one of the best sandwich i had for a while ,,,,,
I will try to go back next week...."}
{"text":"I went here with quite a large group (over 25 people). The place was able to crunch out the food as fast as we were able to order them.  The place offers about 10 to 12 different kinds of sandwiches including a vegetarian and a vegan option. 

The popular sandwiches are Cheek, Tongue and the fish taco.  Other options include pulled pork, pulled chicken, lamb and a burger.  The fries are sliced finger potato's and are really delicious - although I could've had more.  

Drinks include your usual selection of soft drinks and water but also for grabs are three types of beer and two kinds of red wine plus a white wine. 

We ordered the tongue and cheek sandwiches plus two beers and side orders of potatoes and beet slaw for $61.00.  Plenty of parking is available at the close by Green P parking lot although some of our friends parked right behind the restaurant.  

In summary, the food was excellent, the service was great and the owners (wife and husband) are very friendly. I highly recommend visiting this place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches that comes with super tasty sides.  I had the Six with beet salad.  I wish I can eat that everyday for lunch.  Good thing I have to walk a few blocks to get here.  Nice atmosphere and they have a great selection of sauces that you can bring to the table.  I like the red pepper sauce.  If you love Toronto and food then you have to try the Six."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nothing like what you would expect from a sandwich place. Truly delicious food, caring personnel, well designed and clean interior and great atmosphere inside. I waited for a second visit to leave a review and my second order tasted even better than the first. The first time I ordered a tongue sandwich in a corn tortilla (all sandwiches can be made gluten free this way) and I got fries to make sure I get enough calories in case if the portion ends up being small. The portion was good, and everything tasted great. Second time I ordered lamb sandwich with beet slaw and it was just amazing. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches! Extremely flavourful and a good selection of meats that you can't get everywhere."}
{"text":"Walked in here not expecting too much, walked out not impressed at all.

First, food. No flavour whatsoever. I got a beef cheek sammie with beet slaw on the side. My bf got a beef tongue sandwich with fries. The most flavourful component of sandwiches was the baguette which they get from a local bakery. The meat was tender but nothing more than that. The sauce didn't have any taste to it, so it failed to bring all the components together. I could not taste truffle or red onions, or arugula which all are supposed to have somewhat strong and unique flavours. Beet slaw lacked acidity which would have helped a lot to brighten up the dish. Even their hot sauce....not spicy at all. Fries were good though, different compared to other joints. 

Details: menu board was not helpful at all (tiny and faint fonts) and stools were way too high. The staff did not even know about the menu (mixed up our sandwiches so we had to ask the owner, she did not know anything about two house-made hot sauces). 

Each sandwich was $13 (before tax) including one side (maybe soft drink too? they need to make their menu more clear for sure. We didn't bother to ask because we didn't want drinks anyway). I don't see myself going there nor recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Had the lamb sandwich and beet slaw. It's this and Black Camel in a league of their own. Best sandwiches. The bread here is perfect."}
{"text":"The 122 (pulled pork) is AMAZING. Wonderful flavour, and nice and saucy, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and had The Six which is slow braised beef tongue with arugula, truffle mayo, and re onions on a baguette. Also had the beet slaw.  It was good!

Atmosphere is casual and service is good. It was pretty busy when we were there and their Cheek and Bun sandwich was sold out.

Check this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Famous lamb sandwich is nice. Good flavors. Fries are more wedges than fries. Overall a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My new fav spot for top level foodie fare. Cozy ambiance, upscale decor. Not your average sandwich board selections but to my surprise the list was full favorite comfort/soul delicacies. I can recommend the  braised beef cheek on sourdough. Tender buttury and so tasty. Went back already for the nicest fish tacos I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"If you're planning to come here i recommend the lamb and the beef burger. Wasn't too impressed by the tacos nor the mushroom burger"}
{"text":"I ordered THE BRIT. It was presented beautifully, and most important, tasted delicious (it smelt good, too). I'd recommend that if you do go here, make plans to sit in and enjoy the cozy environment like I should have (but I had to run)."}
