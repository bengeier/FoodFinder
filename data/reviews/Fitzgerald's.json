{"text":"Had a good time at the pub.  Bar tinder was very friendly and helpful.  Beer was a decent price"}
{"text":"Here's my experience at Fitzgerald's: we were seated.   We waited 30 minutes for a waitress to take our order, but they were all busy flirting with guys at the bar. We left unnoticed. If I could give 0 stars I would. Honestly, I've gotten better service at the NC DMV.  Good for those guys at the bar though!"}
{"text":"We came in with a group of 12. We were given, by our hotel, coupons for free appetizers.  They would not honor them. I ask to speak with the manager Emmitt and Emmitt never came to our table. Emmitt totally disregarded us as customers. I will never patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"The 2 rating is only because our server was awesome.  She knew we were upset and did everything she could to make us happy.  It's to bad this attitude doesn't extend to the kitchen.  We asked if the prime rib was lean.  Kitchens answer was we have no idea.  So we ended up with a salad bar and a chicken dinner instead of the prime rib.  The kitchen doesn't seem to care about customer service.  We have kept trying to come here, but it seems each time we come it gets worse.  Must be due to change of ownership."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  The hostess seemed more bothered than anything when we were seated. The waitress was not knowledgeable about the handful of Gluten Free items on the menu. In fact I had to tell her that something was actually GF even though it was marked on the menu. I ordered the GF chicken tenders which were slightly warm. The water had a funny taste to it so I ordered a coffee with cream and sugar. She brought cream and equal and no spoon to stir my coffee.  I ended up asking the bartender for sugar which they had to go find because there was none behind the bar.   Very disappointed with the food and service."}
{"text":"In town from Florida and stopped by for lunch on a recommendation from a friend.  I had the pretzel bites for a appetizer and BBQ burger both dishes excellent! The manager Nick Cromer came by my table and it turns out he is from Florida too, what a nice young man, very knowledgeable on the area and sports. I am bringing my family back up right after Christmas and will be sure to stop back."}
{"text":"We moved back to WI about 11 years ago and ate at Fitzgeralds shortly after that.  We were not impressed back then and it took us over a decade to return.    Last month our party of 6 ate there for Easter.  It was fantastic.   We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the entire staff was very pleasant and attentive.  The entire place has been remodeled and it no longer strikes us as a dingy old-style Supper Club.  Everything seemed fresh and very clean.  Despite the fact Fitzgeralds was serving only a Buffet for the Easter service, everything was very, very good.  The salad bar is outstanding and provides great variety, and the chicken, ribs, dressing, potatoes, etc. was all fresh, hot, and extremely tasty.    The soft custard was a big hit with our kids, and the huge desert table was a big hit with the rest of us.  We'll definitely be back. Well done Fitzgeralds!"}
{"text":"I was most pleasantly surprised.  I'm glad i did not pay too much attention to the mediocre star rating and occasionally bad review.  The service was excellent and the food was outstanding.  I am planning to eat there again when I am in uptown.  I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I ordered the Southwestern burger with coleslaw. The burger wasn't anything special and I had asked the waitress if the coleslaw was a creamy coleslaw (she said yes) and it was dry and...yuck.  I didn't eat it.  Overall I wasn't impressed with the food and it appears to be a place people go just for it's pub culture and location."}
{"text":"I love the remodel that was done, the decor change from the old Buckhead Saloon turned out really well.  However, the decor has changed, but it appears to be the same old Buckhead crowd (those that have just turned 21 or maybe 22 and are ready to drink till they throw up).  This is a great place to drink, but I wouldn't recommend it as somewhere to enjoy a dinner.  The music is very, very loud and the patrons are usually extremely drunk.  I've been here twice and every time I sit at the bar someone ends up spilling their drink on me in some fashion :)  I went to watch a Panther's pre-season game, but with the dj playing it really wasn't a very memorable experience.  I figured that at 8pm on a Saturday, they'd have the sound on for the tvs, but there was a dj playing and he had the volume cranked up at full force.  Warning: The layout is kinda weird, so when there's a crowd, be prepared to push and shove your way through a sea of people to get to the restrooms (which are located at the very back)."}
{"text":"I got the blackend parm wings and my only mistake was not ordering 20 of these bad boys.  They are some of my favorite in the area"}
{"text":"I have gone to fitzgeralds for more than 20 years and never have received such horrible service. We never received our drinks. Waited 45 minutes to order and over an hour for our food. Still sitting here waiting for the check. I would not recommend this place any longer."}
{"text":"All the negative reviews here over the past few months aren't  entirely accurate. This place is far worse!    Avoid at all costs.  Wish we would have looked here first.  I only selected one star because I had to.  So sad."}
{"text":"Great bar. Great wait staff. Kitchen does not care. The kitchen does not know the meaning of hospitality.  The new owners need to be on site."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group of friends. Salmon came out like a dry piece of cardboard. When we asked to have something else we were told it would be a long wait by the manager because they were backed up in the kitchen. By reading the reviews you will see that many others had similar experiences.  The manager had no idea how to resolve or deal with the issue. Terrible attitude. Despite it all the waitress was sweet and we tipped her well. Save your money!  Overall we have found some excellent food and service in Charlotte. Sauceman's for Barbeque was outstanding and 5Church was a great meal with top notch service. Each deserves their own review.   As for  Fitzgerald's Irish Pub?  Awful food, even worse service, BIG MISTAKE!"}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you about my experience here, but I didn't have one.  While waiting for a table, I grabbed a drink from the bar.  Unfortunately, this process was cumbersome - at best - since half the yuppies in Uptown were using the bar / stools / floor as space to lay their jackets / bags / laptops as they stand in crowds around the now-obsolete bar seating.  Once seated, I became a ghost.  Like a wind-swept trinket buried in the desert sands, the longer I waited, the more forgotten my existence.    I attribute this to a complete lack of professionalism on behalf of the server(s) who made little effort to actually work and maximum effort to socialise with friends at the bar.  Secondary to this is a hostess who, against all odds, exerted inhuman levels of apathy in rectifying this issue as it unfolded before her very eyes.  Total garbage, -10 out of 10, more like \"Shitzgerald's\"."}
{"text":"Horrible. The bartenders ignored us for over 15 minutes while they helped several others that came up to the bar after us. Perhaps they need to get a male bartender who is is willing to wait on females."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating and large bar area too. Only had a few beers but the place had a good vibe to it."}
{"text":"They used to be great. Picture is $28 of Food. That small wing was supposed to be dark meat. 2 small pieces of baked fish no butter given. No waiting in line at 530p, no wonder. Drive thru menu not accurate and nobody really cared. Doubt we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Went with a friend once. Service was alright, bread was good, sides were good. Oddly enough, the worst part of the meal were the steaks - they weren't seasoned evenly or cooked very well.   I'd try it again sometimes, but I wouldn't get a steak there."}
{"text":"Im sitting here during the SUPER BOWL and this place has no satellite signal!  After asking around, I found that this is a regular occurrence.   Had I known I would NEVER cone to this place during a crucial sports event!  So pissed!!"}
{"text":"Do not get their fried mozzarella. It's weird and it was cold and hard. The marinara sauce sucked, but the fries were ok. The service was also not good. Overall, this place is completely forgettable. I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"I'm a regular I go to FItz at least once a week if not more. The cheese \"triangles\" are the absolute best thing I've ever had in life. Lots of drinks to choose from, if you don't know what you want consult with a bartender. Ive had everything on the menu and I love it all besides the queso. Justin is hot lol I love him Overall best bar to have a good time and a drink!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch sports at with reasonable prices and good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for Valentine's wknd and came across this bar. The 1st time I attended(friday) my friend and I had a great time. Drinks made by a female bartender was good and the energy in the bar was fun. The next nite(sat) b/c we enjoyed ourselves the nite before, we invited another friend to experience this bar. Well this nite was horrible, a bartender by the name of Justin was so RUDE and COCKY all b/c I asked him for a lil bit more liquor b/c the drink was SUPER weak. I asked him very politely and he told me(paying customer), \"the drink wasnt weak b/c he made it\". My friend and I were in shock how bold he was.  Unless he tasted my drink, how could he tell me how it tasted? He refused to add more liquor, but he did add some nasty behavior along wit his sidekick wit reddish hair. They proceeded to embarrass me, the one w/ the reddish hair LIED and told a bouncer that I said things that I didnt say. A supposedly mgr on shift definitely wasnt any help and didnt care to provide humble customer service. So basically they called a bouncer to have me removed fr the bar all because Justin's ego was shot. Before I left, the so called mgr(didnt get his name) added a bit more liquor after I asked numerous times for a refund for the drink I didnt drink. Because I didnt want to escalate the situation into a physical altercation, I left the drink and the bar feeling disrespected, embarrassed, pissed,etc. I refused to allow how I got treated untold. So this is my first time EVER writing a review because I felt the treatment was so unnecessary. Justin must think thats he's the best bartender in the world and cant make a weak drink..so he lashes out like a spoiled brat b/c his drink wasnt satisfying. But to put the icing on the cake, I saw a couple days later that they had the audacity to still CHARGE my card and a full cup of weakness was left on the bar. But please believe they will refund my money b/c Im not gonna get treated like this by these barbaric men.  SHAME..SHAME..SHAME"}
{"text":"My friends and I dined in the restaurant on a Friday for lunch and it was horrible. This was our first time visiting the restaurant. We were there 45 mins & had to ask for our food, we never rec'd any refills on drinks. My fish was cold & It took 15 mins for me to get it back and it was just reheated. The microwave only takes 30 secs & the fish was just lukewarm. They could have at least given me a fresh one. I had asked for no mash potatoes & rec'd it anyway. The waitress told us that the special included honey glazed carrots, she was wrong. I found that out when I asked her why didn't I have carrots. She said that she forgot that it's asparagus today. Never asked me if I wanted or liked asparagus. She forgot the mac & cheese & when she brought it to the table she just laid it there and kept moving, no \"I apologize\" or an explanation. She never apologized or even looked at me when she brought the fish back to me either. The mac & cheese had some type of string in it. After poking & proding it, we still couldn't figure out what the object was floating in the mess of velvetta they call mac & cheese. She must have been having a bad day because it was written all over her face. The buffalo chicken sandwich had some shaved almonds on top of it. I assume it was supposed to be almond crusted, which wasn't on the menu. One of my friends had to go in the kitchen and get our ticket where she found the Mgr & the waitress chatting it up & laughing. She also hadh to stand over her while she closed out our ticket. She laid it down on the table and said \"Oh, he gave you a 15% discount for the food and stuff\". Really? He could have graced us with his presence. We were there an hour and 15 mins and there were only 3 tables ahead of us and they waited just as long as we did, some even longer. The Mgr never showed his face, unless it was the gentleman serving tables. I've heard the same complaints from other associates. They won't be in business long at this rate."}
{"text":"Is there a way to give negative stars?  We chose this place because it seemed like a nice quiet place to chill and talk.  At first, that's exactly what we got.  Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.  We were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio. However, they didn't take an active role in getting the homeless people to leave until one actually went into the bar.  They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.  Around 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \"for a long time.\" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \"friend\" watching us. They were rude every time we used the restroom. They were rude about us being on the patio.  They were rude about picking up our glassware from the patio. At 1:55am they apparently got sick of waiting for us to leave and we watched as the bartenders ran up the street with the friend they were sitting at the bar with to make last call at another bar (which they told us they wanted to do earlier in the night).  The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw). There are far too many better options uptown to waste your time at a place that does not care about your business."}
{"text":"My daughter and I wantes to go someplace we hadn't been before and excited on Fitzgerald's. The staff was unbelievably friendly. I got the Sheppard's Pie with green beans and my daughter got a burger. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Rude staff for making a big deal about sitting at a table in an unused section away from the noisy standing room only crowd, menu was small and only had a few generic appetizers, put reserved on all tables around us even though they obviously weren't so we definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"Wife and I had the Fish and Chips. We figured you can't go wrong in an Irish place. Well, we were wrong. Our first indication was seeing the regular, skinny fries on the plate. That's not \"chips\"in the sense of an Irish plate. The fish was terrible. I don't think anyone is this place has ever tasted it. The batter was so thick that is was brown and crispy on the outside but very doughy and chewy on the inside. So much so that with every bite I felt like I was eating raw fish. It was only the batter but man that was just a nasty texture. Didn't see anything on the menu to come back for..."}
{"text":"Great brunch!!! The service was great, even on a day as busy as Easter, and food was great. We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We came in at about 4:30 and ordered the Friday Special salmon in dill cream sauce and sweet potato crusted chicken. Seating was immediate and service was prompt and attentive, personable, yet not obtrusive. We drank draft Harps while our food was prepared. I absolutely LOVE draft Harp. There's an added taste of the Irish Sea: a salty, mineral-rich freshness which I don't taste in the bottled version.      Our food came quickly and was absolutely AMAZING ! We expected bar food, and instead received high-caliber cuisine unmatched by anything I have ever eaten elsewhere. My fiancee used to dine at the Tower Club, and this food matches the food prepared by a chef trained by Julia Child.      We had recently had similar entrees at a regional winery, and this food was so remarkably superior it was mind-boggling. The rather large piece of salmon was cooked perfectly: moist flakes of juicy flesh melted in my mouth. The dill sauce was a perfect complement, letting the flavor of the fish shine.The chunky mashed  potatoes were marvelous: a burst of garlic flavor, followed by spicy deliciousness with a creamy lingering finish... like a fine wine, there was a complete sensory trajectory. The asparagus, we both enjoyed, evidenced the chef's New Orleans training. My fiancee's chicken was extraordinary: the combination of sweet potato, red peppers, onions and mango was spiced superbly (cinnamon ? allspice ?); the chicken was cooked to perfection: tender and moist.       Our dinner was rounded out with draft Guinness and chocolate chip cookies soft and chewy and fresh from the oven, served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce which married perfectly with the stout    The meal was so extraordinary that I did something I have never done, namely, ask the waitress to convey to the chef that this was the finest restaurant meal that I have ever been served. The chef, Deacon, came to our table and we were able to compliment him and his skill and thank him personally.      The decor, ambiance and service were fine. The food was EXCELLENT ! ( Odd to us how haters rate this place too loud and too quiet and ignore the Irish food on the menu !)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with a group of about ten for the Steelers game.  Our server Emily did a great job, given a crazy football crowd and high demands of drinks.    If you're a Steelers fan or just want to grab a drink, this is the place for you. Standard bar food; wings, dips, sandwiches, salads, etc. I didn't order any food, but a few took others did at the table did and it took forever and ended up getting compt.   I had their $3 mimosa which was so heavy on the OJ and not even a nice pour in the wine glass. I also got a bucket of bud light which was $25. $25 for a bucket really?.... This place is a standard sports bar Uptown. It's large and has patio seating in the heart of uptown."}
{"text":"Wave those Terrible Towels!  Being a Pittsburgh transplant, I was looking for a bar to watch the Steeler's game and read great reviews about Fitzgerald's. My nephew (also from Pgh) was visiting Charlotte, so we went to Fitzgerald's to watch the Patriots-Steelers game Sunday Oct 23.  From the moment we walked into the place, we felt \"at home\".  We sat at the back bar and were treated like family by Dina and Zane.  They totally hooked us up ;)  From the abundance of Steelers fans and flat screens, to the beer selection and great food, we felt welcome. They even played cool music whenever there was a commercial break in the game.  Garage parking is free and conveniently located right next door.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was great except for sandy spinach.  The manager contacted me and explained the issue was related to a last minute supplier.  Adding a star as this was the only thing keeping them from it.    I appreciate good management!"}
{"text":"My parents and I went to Fitzgerald's tonight for the first time in a while, although it had always been one of my mom's favorites. Wow. What a disappointment. It was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We arrived at 6 pm on a Friday for the fish fry. There were less than a dozen cars in the parking lot, and they didn't even have the dining room open, only the bar area. Empty tables everywhere but we were told we had to wait 20 minutes for a table (although there are tons of empty tables, they apparently had NO waitstaff there. At 6 pm on a Friday). The menu had been decimated, my mom's favorite dish is no longer on the menu, and what's left is minimal and very typical bar and grill fare, nothing special.  Based on what we saw, the waitstaff that eventually showed up were the children of a bartender and our waitress could not have been older than 16.  She was very nice but so inexperienced and didn't know what she was doing. I ordered a steak medium well and it came medium rare, I sent it back once but it didn't come back any more done and I didn't have the heart to send it back again. We waited for an inordinate amount of time for our check. Fitzgeralds, what the hell happened? From a family favorite to the worst dining experience I've ever had. We will never go here again."}
{"text":"Wow. Words can't explain the love I have for this establishment. Would recommend for ANYONE. I'm talking people here for a quick visit, people new to Charlotte, or people looking for a new regular spot. Great food and great people. SARAH IS THE BEST SERVER OF ALL TIME. NO ONE CAN SERVE LIKE SHE CAN! Everytime I've eaten there I've seen Kyle (the general manager) or Kevin(the owner) walking around with the most approachable and friendly smiles! They are always there to help and make my already EXTREMELY pleasant experience there even better. The nightlife is even better. If you're looking for an better than best Irish car Bomb or any liquid libations ask for Zane, Marissa, or Alexa. I love this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Quite possible the worst food I've had in Charlotte.  Sent the crab dip back THREE DIFFERENT TIMES for being cold. Anyone knows that crab dip should burn your mouth the first bite lol.  This stuff was nearly room temperature. The salad we ordered was nearly SOUP due to the amount of dressing and the wings were barely done and I asked for them crispy.  Bar staff was nice. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised when they could quickly accommodate a party of 8 quickly. The atmosphere is very casual and there are lots of tvs around the dining room.   Our server was friendly and efficient. The menu had traditional Irish fare and American fare too. There was also a large selection of draft beers on tap and you could order special layered beers too like snakebites and Black and Tans.   We tried the fried pickles, Chicken sliders and fries. Others in our party enjoyed the kabobs, Mac and cheese, spinach, mashed potatoes and a wrap. We all enjoyed our food and the portions were very plentiful. If we had not been staying in a hotel we would have leftovers for the next day.   The fried pickles were specially good and very reasonably priced at $6. The pickles were thick cut, breaded with corn meal and served with ranch dressing.   They also had a new cocktail list that looked good. I tried the Gaelic punch (they couldn't make my first choice) and it was so delicious I ordered a second.   Overall, the food and drinks were good, as was the service. We would definitely go back and maybe sit outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar by myself while traveling.  Had a $3 draught special that night that the bartender told me about so I ordered. Black and Tan.  Failed to tell me that Guiness was the one exception when I said \"sounds great\" and ordered the B &T.   She also had no clue how to pour a B&T even though the spoon was right there next to the tap and other bartenders were using it.  Regardless my $9 drink tab was $19.50 when it arrived, the bartender headed for the hills so I just paid it rather than wait any longer.  As for the food, the Reuben was soggy but good.  Really liked the corned beef.  The blue cheese dressing was the consistency of milk with some tiny bits of something that I assume was flavorless blue cheese.  Too many other choices down there."}
{"text":"I went for all you can eat crab legs on Tuesday night. The food was amazing, service was friendly and quick, and the music was exceptional. Did I mentioned ALL YOU VAN EAT CRAB?! It doesn't get much better than that. The only downfall was aside from the decor, there is nothing pub-ish about the place...a very minor thing to overlooking for such a great experience."}
{"text":"A solid three star experience.  We did the Sunday Brunch.  I liked the salad bar and some of the selections but many of what I put on my plate was dull and spice less.  For the price I think the value was good and the service was better than average for a buffet.  We'll go back someday but we won't be in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"I always order with foodie call and these burgers and nachos are just awesome!   Long day at work not wanting to cook and wanting a little cheat food this is a great place to get it."}
{"text":"Got stuck due to a delayed flight and came in for lunch on a Tuesday at noon. Special was a chicken sandwich. Good food. Had a couple pints of Guinness, good, poured properly, attentive bar tender. The bar area is nice and clean. Comfortable seats, lots of tvs. They have this mobile charging station on one of the pillars by the bar where you can put your phone and lock it in the drawer to charge safely while you continue about you business. I think that is a nice convenience and a good idea. Seems like they have some decent drink and food specials. Lots of space.   I like it.  Also, they have a decent selection of Irish whiskey. But I would consider it a sports bar with an Irish feel rather than an Irish pub and bar. Less authentic feeling because they focus on the US sports team aspect."}
{"text":"Service very poor.  No hostess at the front to greet people.  Basic service 101.  They need to go back to the drawing board here.  Had to get our own silverware.  Then to top it off they no longer accepted our coupon that had not expired.   Will not be back ever!!!"}
{"text":"We used to eat here frequently for fish fry, but the last 3 times have been terrible.  First we didn't get any slaw, tartar sauce or rolls.  I told them about it the next time we ordered and they just said \"okay\" and then forgot them again.  Tonight the fish tasted terrible, the fries were burnt, coleslaw had way too much mayo, rolls were stale and one of the cookies was literally black.  I think we've given up on this place."}
{"text":"I came here with Nicolette after we saw Cirque du Soleil for a late dinner, and to get our parking validated.  Since it was a Wednesday they were playing trivia, which probably starts somewhere around 9-9:30. We got there after the second round of 4, so we just played along, but not competitively, which was disappointing because they looked like they had some pretty great prizes.   On Wednesdays they have $3 drafts. They also have Woodchuck on draft, so I was pretty excited.   I ordered the chicken and cheese sliders, which have just chicken, bacon, and cheese. Doesn't that sound really good? Well it was. I ate 2 of them (they come with 4) and took the rest home for my husband to enjoy.   Nicolette ordered a massive burger with a lot of things on it, and a salad, that never came out. When she told our waitress, she immediately brought it out, and took it off the bill. It was a lot of food, but it was good for me because my sliders didn't come with a side, so I got to partake in Nicolette's fries. They were good, but could have been cooked longer, because they were kind of on the mushy side.   Overall, I had a lot of fun here, and if you can play trivia on a Wednesday, I would come out and have some fun!"}
{"text":"Nothing special but fine for a quick beer or a burger.  We sat at the bar, bartenders were friendly enough, when you can hunt them down."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for lunch during on of our many trips to Charlotte for NBA basketball. We frequently stay at the Holiday Inn down the street and can see loads of people enjoying Fitzgerald's and here the loud music every night. Judging from the amount of people who go there we figured Fitzgerald's must be ok and it was. We both got the fish and chips and everything was well prepared and the staff was super friendly. Nothing to jump up and down about but it was good and I do recommend checking this resturant out."}
{"text":"I tried for first time before going to hornets game and it was a great decision, fun environment and contest before  game chances to win tickets also great food and drink special, plus validated parking which is a big plus specially in a game night...definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"First time to Charlotte,  this place was recommended.  Very nice and clean inside,  Great service.  Had the Dublin broil with asparagus,  off the hook. I would come again."}
{"text":"I love Fitzgerald's as a weekend bar stop, but I think I'm going to have to check this one off completely as far as a lunch spot. I came here on Thursday to give their burger lunch special a shot ... $6 1/2lb & $5 1/3lb burgers.   To start our meal off, service was extremely slow. I was in about 1:45pm, after the lunch rush already had gone through, so this was pretty disappointing in and of itself. When I ordered my burger, I made sure to ask the waitress if the burger \"temperature\" was true to order, as they're usually always more well than you order. She assured me it was very true to order, so I went with medium cooked 'Shillelagh'. Burger came out with not one speck of pink in it .. but service was taking so long I didn't even bother sending it back or I would have been going on a 1.5 hour lunch break. The patty was so dry it ruined the burger for me complete, I ended up just eating the corned beef/saurkraut off of it and leaving half the patty.  Overall, very disappointed with lunch, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a good burger. Maybe I'll give something traditionally Irish a try next time and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Went here and had a black and blew burger and a blue moon beer. Man this food was good, will definatly be coming back. I highly reccomend trying this place,you wont be let down."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and nice atmosphere, the service is good. Had the BBQ burger and really enjoyed it, the fries were too salty tho. Will definitely comeback"}
{"text":"I have been to Fitz ' s on many occasions before or after other event s uptown and just realized I had not previously written a review.   So... my most recent visit was after the Imagine Dragons concert at TWC arena. Tim & I were hungry as we didn't have time to grab dinner before the concert.   We got a booth and & started to check out the menu. I forgot how limited the late night menu is here.  We ended up getting a order of fried cheese & chicken tenders.    I gotta say, the fried cheese was just terrible! Not only did it have the appearance & consistency of frozen crud, it also tasted as if it had been fried in old oil that had been used to cook fish.  Yuck! It was so bad that  Tim sent it back & he never does that!  Thankfully the chicken was much better in texture & flavor - no yucky fishy taste.  The sauce was meh though - I got BBQ sauce and thought it was too thick & just didn't have a great flavor.   The service was pretty good and we did not have to wait long for food or drinks to come out. All in all, a good place to go for bevvies but they could stand to make improvements in the late night menu."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice. Wait staff was excellent. Food was mediocre. Chicken sliders were not impressive and overcooked. Pretzel bites were over done. At $6-$7 per beer it was overpriced. Pretty big place but nothing Irish. It's just the name."}
{"text":"Here's a seasonal review:  My fiancée's uncle treats us to the Thanksgiving buffet each year, and this makes the third year running. I guess I'm thankful for that. Hopefully, we get to do it for several years running, too because it's always a nice time.   I've gotta be honest, the idea of going out to eat for Thanksgiving was really foreign to me the first time I tagged along as my fiancée's plus one. I thought it might be a really awkward time full of old bitties whose families don't visit them anymore or something.  Nothing so sad, though.  The food is always pretty decent. A skilled cook could spend the whole day preparing a meal and come away with more flavorful turkey and heartier potatoes, sure. For those of us who can do without the mess in our own kitchen, though--and can spare the cost--this is a suitable substitute, for sure.  Also, in an attempt to make this review have some utility for the other 364 days of the year, their bartenders know their way around a brandy old fashioned..."}
{"text":"I usually come here quite often during Football season since this is one of the official Steelers bars in the city. The food and the service is usually good when I come here I've been coming here for quite a while and I don't recall anything bad happening beside an occasional annoying fan but u have to expect that when u go out to watch a game. Today I had the grilled buffalo chicken wrap with no blue cheese, fries on the side and ranch dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Tom is great. he definitely knows the difference between an ale and a lager. He knows his shit."}
{"text":"The best time to go to Fitzgeralds is on Sunday for their Brunch. It is great. They have a large selection of food for everyone. I would definitely recommend this place for Sunday brunch. We've been going their for years, and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 10 stars!  We had the most amazing experience at this joint.   The staff is friendly, the food was phaaaaaay nominal.   Our bartendress Alex makes the experience that much better.   She really sells the brand.   Definitely would fly to Charlotte again just for the experience.   Awesome job to everyone on the Fitzgerald's staff!   Bravo! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday night with 12 of my friends who work uptown and had amazing service from Rachel.  Being a bartender I couldn't of asked for better service."}
{"text":"Omg the food is delicious. I had fish and chips. Hubby had mushroom and gouda burger. Fabulous. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went with my girls a few Saturdays back, we were celebrating a birthday party with my sorority sisters, and all I can say is WOW!! I have yet to be in a less pretentious bar/club/restaurant in Charlotte. Our drinks were served up by great bartenders, the people were fun and not rowdy, and best of all, we weren't molested by weird dudes all night wanting to grind up on us. Secondly, we were treated like queens by the the regular Saturday night DJ that night as well. He took our requests, had shots with us and treated us like we were regulars. Most DJs in the city won't give you the time of day, but Botz was great, he really made our night. We have been back on Saturday night ever since and have had the same great experience. Go here, you won't be disappointed. One more thing, this is an Irish bar in name only, but still a great time."}
{"text":"This place is been headed downhill steadily for the last several years, but lately, it's hit rock bottom as far as food quality and especially service goes. A few weeks ago we walked in to have dinner on a Saturday night and ended up walking out again. The restaurant was probably 50% capacity and I saw several servers walking around, and yet, we sat and sat and sat completely ignored. After 20 minutes, we walked out. Give me a drink or an appetizer and I can be very patient, but with no acknowledgment at all, I usually write off that establishment forever.     Uncharacteristically for us, we decided to give Fitzgeralds another try last weekend--big mistake... It began as a repeat of our last visit with no acknowledgment at all after being seated.  We were just about to walk out when the server came by and took our drink order.  Although the restaurant was not busy at all, we scarcely saw our server again. We did receive our meals--which I consider little better than bar food--and never saw her again. Oh wait, we did see her again... She was vacuuming the dining room which I found very annoying (The restaurant was still open for another hour) and never could be bothered to come back and check if we needed anything (we did).  After finishing our meals, we waited and waited as she vacuumed and vacuumed. I finally stood up and waved my arms as if I was trying to flag down a car, and I was finally able to get her attention. We paid our bill and will never return again.   We are generally very easy-going and I understand any restaurant can have a bad night, but in this case I think two strikes and they're out."}
{"text":"Average at best. Nice decor, but our server was unattentive and lacked personality. We were expecting the salad bar to be included with our entrees, but nope, 2.99 extra! Really?? That was for a subpar salad bar at best. And get this, the Saturday night prime rib \"special\" is the same cost as any other night. To be fair, the meat was tasty, but seemed small for $24.00 with no included salad bar. For $18.99, the salad bar certainly should have been included with five pieces of shrimp and a baked potato. Can't justify going back...."}
{"text":"I really hate to rate Fitzgeralds this low - but I've gone a few times and have been disappointed with the food each time.   This last time I ordered chicken sliders and the mac & cheese.  I couldn't even eat the mac & cheese, but my waitress nicely removed it from my check.  The chicken sliders were very tough and hard to eat.  I do appreciate that they validate your parking for the Wake Forest garage, that has come in handy on weekends when they try to charge an arm & a leg at every parking garage.  The TV's and the sound are great for watching games!"}
{"text":"Cool spot, came in on a Thursday night. Nice service and quick food. Loved the fish and chips and Sheppard's pie was great too. Wine was half price that night!! Good bang for your buck if you're looking for a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to have their buffet with my family on a Saturday. The selection looked appetizing, but tasted HORRIBLE. A salt lick was disguised as dinner (fortunately, I probably will not need embalming fluid once I pass -- considering the incidental preservation). Since i picked it out, I was trying to trick my wife into thinking I liked it, but I could not make it through a 2nd plate.   The waitress was poor. Her shrill manner and punch-drunk words almost equaled the disgusting taste of the food.   Sadly, EVEN Old Country Buffet's service and food far exceed that of this sh*thole at a 1/3 of the cost."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! They have daily specials for lunch and drinks. Not to mention showing all the local games.   Free validated parking on nights and weekends is a major plus in Uptown!"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here. The server was quick to take our order and friendly, but the execution of service was a bit off. I ordered my drink, but got another one, and then when I got the one I originally wanted it didn't taste right. I'm a mojito connoisseur and this one was watered down, lacked fresh limes, and the fizz couldn't be found...how they could even serve it was beyond me. Needless to say, I enjoyed my company and the patio, but while everyone else was sipping on their beverage I was either waiting on mine or correcting it."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3 stars in my opinion. There is nothing special about it but also nothing to complain about. I work at Hearst tower so we go in after work often. The appetizer sampler is great for a group and they usually have decent beers on tap."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Got a barbecue burger, which was decent. Stayed after dinner to watch NBA games on TV over a few beers. They had lots of TVs showing different sports and a great playlist of 90's jams that night!"}
{"text":"Nice Sunday brunch.  Good variety of selections.  Pleasant atmosphere and attentive wait staff!"}
{"text":"Ordered via foodiecall for lunch this week. I had the chicken sliders which were pretty great, but standard. What sold me was the guinness tiramisu. I don't think I've ever had anything like it. Extraordinarily rich and decadent. Double layered. Thick, creamy mascarpone. Heaven on my tastebuds.  Can't wait to try the goatcheese burger!!"}
{"text":"This place was such a surprise. I wasn't expecting much considering the previous reviews, however came here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. My bf and I sat at the bar in the back and the bartender was super sweet. She poured us great drinks and provided great service. I got the fried pickles (free upon checking in with a $5 purchase) and bf ordered fried mozzarella and side of fries. Soooooooo good. Seriously some of the best fried pickles I've ever had and they were lightly breaded so it wasn't so greasy! The fries tasted like Arby's curly fries minus the curly part. The fried mozzarella was some of the best I've ever had (& I love mozz sticks). These were in the shape of a triangle and had so much cheese in them. I would come back just for these. The atmosphere was great too, we were there right before a Charlotte Hornets game and it was crowded but not too packed. We had a great time and plan to come back!"}
{"text":"After posting my first review of Fitzgerald's, I was contacted by the restaurant and politely asked to give them another try. I really appreciated this - it showed to me that they care about what people are saying and trying to improve.   So we went to Fitzgerald's again last Sunday for dinner. Upon entering we noticed some changes. Looks like the remodeled some and I liked the changes. Some things were still a bit old, so maybe this is still in progress (but heading in the right direction).   We were greeted right away and sat at a nice table away from the door. Our waitress was excellent, very nice and did a great job. 4 or 5 stars for service which is always good.   Our group ordered steak and ribs for dinner. I got a Filet Mignon - the petite size for $24.99. It was good and cooked properly. Came with a cup of Au Jus for some reason which I'm not used to getting with a filet. (and later spilt everywhere). To be honest the steak was a bit small for the price. It did come with salad bar and a side, both of which were quite good. My wife got a Ribeye (I think) and she wasn't as happy. Better size for the price, but she said it was kind of tough. My mom got the ribs and although a bit lathered in sauce for me, she loved it.   I did enjoy the salad bar, for a day that was probably not so busy - it was well kept and everything seemed very fresh. The waitress also brought out a loaf of hot fresh baked (or at least warmed) bread. Call me old fashioned, but I loved this. Very good bread and a nice touch to a meal.   Overall, everything was decent even if the portions were a bit small for the price. I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars because the server did such an excellent job. I'm happy to revise my review and trust that Fitzgerald's is a nice neighborhood place that is doing its best to improve each day."}
{"text":"I was summoned to Charlotte from my humble, rocky hermit lair of Mt. Downey Jr., North Dakota for the wedding of two of my friends and decided I was in the mood for something to eat during the day before the wedding.  The idea of food in general is below me, there is literally no point.  In the literal sense. Literally.  You consume it only to need it again shortly.  I usually consist off a diet of heavy trade winds I keep in bottles and Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel (which doesn't count as food), so this is unusual indeed.  My comrades wanted authentic Irish and that is indeed what Fitzgerald's served up: Nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole, Fajitas with Beef and lettuce, and of course the staple Irish dish, a delicious cinnamon-sugar churro with a Corona Light to type it all off.  Baba O' Riley indeed!  If you're in the Charlotte area looking for authentic Irish look no further than Fitzgerald's for genuine and authentic Scottish food."}
{"text":"Wish I would have consulted Yelp before dining here...   I'm new to the area, and drive past this place quite often, and thought I'd give their Sunday brunch a try. Big mistake. The food was awful. With the exception of the salad bar and fresh fruit, everything tasted and looked like it had been previously frozen or canned.   Simply put - I've had continental breakfasts at the Holiday Inn that were better.  Our waiter was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Too bad the food wasn't."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch after appointment out in Waxhaw. This is a pretty cool bar. Lots of screen TV spread all over the bar with different sports games going on.  One would imagine an Irish Pub with bar food this is not the case here for they have variety of cuisines to select from,  Was going to go for the Lamb Kabob, but since it was windy and cold outside decided on the Fish and Chips. The beer batter was out of this world and the cod was chunky. Also ordered the Shepards Pie with tasted like a nice beef stew.  Will be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I was never in here when it was Buckhead, but we stopped in Fitzgerald's over the summer for a beer before the Roger Waters concert.  A month or two later, I got a gift card as part of a silent auction package from the MS Society's Great Gatsby Gala.  What better day to use than when going to two events at the arena in one day?  We stopped in here for dinner between the Charlotte Checkers noon game and the Charlotte Bobcats 7:30 game.  I had the shepherd's pie which was probably the best version of this dish I have had.  The grilled asparagus as my side was very good too.  My friend got the Guinness battered fish and chips, and while he said that the fish (cod) was good, the fries and slaw left a little to be desired.  Our waitress was only okay; definitely not great service but not bad.  The place is huge so there is plenty of room for events before or after uptown events and it is really close to the arena.  If you drive, parking is free in the Wake Forest parking deck after 5pm. The only negative here is that they do not have a whole lot of beers on tap apart from Guinness and Miller Lite, but they at least have Fat Tire in bottles.  More local beer would make this a great place."}
{"text":"Fitz's is best sports bar in Charlotte. It's a fun atmosphere when Penn State or Pittsburgh Steelers score a touchdown. Great service, good bar type food and burgers. Daily food and drink specials and Parking is free with a validation."}
{"text":"Meh. That is the perfect way to describe Fitzgeralds.  The place is not all together bad, but with a plethora of both restaurants and bars in Uptown; why waste your time with this place?  I've been for both drinks and dinner and both experiences were truly 'Meh.'   The food itself is not bad, its bar food-- the same stuff you get at any bar and its good enough-- but when the food takes forever and comes out cold-- kinda makes it hard to judge the quality.  The servers also seem not too inept with when it comes to being attentive or really serving at all.  I am sure there are good servers, but my experience was not so.   My friends came before me and ordered their food at the bar.  When we got a table they told the waiter that they were going to go tell the bar-- he said not too, that he would close out their tabs and transfer their orders to the table.  This was clearly not done as their orders sat at the bar for about 20 minutes before they were brought to the table.  This was only after asking repeatedly for their orders (since all of us were pretty much finished ordering).  He assured them again and again that the kitchen was working on it and they were just backed up.  Finally, the waiter brought the orders to the table and simply explained, 'yeah, they were sitting up at the bar.' No apologies.  Judging by the ice cold french fries-- the orders were sitting there for a while-- which seems a little unsanitary to me . . .   So in conclusion, Fitzgeralds is MEH.  Go somewhere else.  There are PLENTY of bars and restaurants in Uptown-- several serving up the same kinds of food and atmosphere as this place.  For that reason, save your time, your money and your taste buds from an evening at Fitzgeralds."}
{"text":"As a sports bar Fitzgerald's certainly does it for me. Good wings and burgers, lots of big screens, and a decent beer selection. I'd happily go there any night to watch a game and get some grub.   As a late night bar, I'd go elsewhere though. The drinks are pricy and the scene and crowd isn't quite as exciting as other bars in the area.  But it does have a great location. It's in great proximity to the Epicentre and the rest of uptown, and the friendly staff and good bar food make it just above average. Go for some wings and to catch a game and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Sunday brunch buffet a while ago and found this place on google. Very excited to try a new place in Middleton.   When we got there, the place was half empty but it was almost full with my second plate.  The price was ok compared to that of Great Dane for Sunday brunch buffet.   They definitely need some seafood or better meat choices. The salad bar was good enough and I liked the omelet too.  I give 3 star for this restaurant since I kinda enjoyed eating there."}
{"text":"I live in Uptown Charlotte , and Fitzgerald's is one of my go-to places, but they outdid themselves on Mothers Day today! I had the perfect pre-theater lunch accompanied by great Mimosas and even greater service! Thank you Courtney for making it a special day!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Thursday around 1:45 to avoid the lunch rush. They were not busy, but the service was slow. I skimmed the menu (bar food), but found out it was 'burger day'. All of their burgers were on special: $6 for half pound burgers and $5 for third pound burgers. I got the half pound Gouda mushroom burger with a side of broccoli. I ordered it medium, but it came out very well done. It was a little dry, but overall pretty good. Nothing to rave about. I can't complain because it was only $6 (and huge!), but if I paid full price I would be a little let down. Tip: order your burger medium-rare if you want a juicy burger.   I recommend coming here when they have specials. Other than that it's your typical bar/restaurant so don't expect a 5 star meal."}
{"text":"Could not have been more disappointed Sunday (yesterday) the bartender was to busy looking at her phone to even wait on us. Then when we finally got seated outside the waitress seated us right next to a street person that was sitting out there (??) he had puke all over his shirt...so I moved us to a different table. We ordered two slightly dirty martinis that tasted like she poured about an ounce of olive juice in them....really awful. I received crappy service from the same bartender last month so that is it for me at this place. To many other places that want my business."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town. The food quality was fine.  Slow service, rude staff, and an empty restaurant just highlighted the worst reviews as being true to form.  I've had better steaks, better cocktails from restaurants in my hometown. This is Wisconsin. I expected amazing beef. It was the same quality as decent chains and nowhere as nice as places like RCs.  USDA prime, not barely qualifying choice."}
{"text":"Music too loud, but server turned the volume down  Myra was on point with perfect service, with only one tiny error (she forgot my lemon). 20%+ tip well deserved.  Food is good, not great. No legitimate complaints for the price.  Would come again as the burgers are interesting!! Recommend the Gouda Mushroom; the Reuben is unimpressive."}
{"text":"Although it is a plastic paddys, it was a high energy plastic paddys last Saturday night.  We had lots of drinks and enjoyed watching the people and having our kidney stones pulverized by the driving bass.  Nobody singin about Danny Boy or how much they hate  the fuckin Brits in this joint!  We had fun but, if you are gonna call yourself an Irish pub, do something Irish."}
{"text":"I was here with a large group for dinner. The atmosphere has a nice Irish pub feel and I suppose it's a lively place on some nights. The food however was just bad. I had a hamburger I ordered it medium it came well done borderline charred. I ate what I could. The fries were soggy too. I saw other people in our group send food back too. I am giving two stars only because the service was great. It's a shame the food is such a disaster. They need a new chef."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty impressed with this place! I had been drinking prior so my taste buds probably aren't 100% accurate but I thought the pretzel bites and mozzarella bites were extremely tasty! Awesome atmosphere with lots of space! Don't have to worry about finding a seat and the dance floor is pretty cool. Too bad I didn't find this place early! And apparently the parking is free next door if u eat there"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but acceptable bar food with enough variety to satisfy a diverse group."}
{"text":"I was quite excited to try out the new pub that used to be Buckheads though skeptical that they would be able to remove all of the peanut shells likely left behind.  However, their remodeled interior was beautiful!  Instead of small tables used for standing only, there are full tables that can accomadate large parties and multiple new booths along the windows.  I was also impressed that for an uptown location, they offer free parking at a parking garage right next door!  Just make sure to bring your parking ticket into the restaurant so you can have them make a punch mark.    The menu is extensive and the pricing is reasonable ($7.95 and up).  I was disappointed that the only drink specials on their grand opening night was draft beer.  Bleh.  I took advantage of the $3 Blue Moon but by 8 PM we were informed that they had run out.  Not very good planning!  In the future, I'd like to try out their \"Luckitini's\" which are cutely priced at $7.77.    On to the food, as I mentioned, the menu is full of options.  A lot of it is typical pub fare like fish and chips, chicken caesar wraps, burgers, nachos, etc.  I sampled their sweet potato fries and had some of the beer battered fish and chips.  The sweet potato fries were cooked just like I love - not crisp but lightly coated with butter and salt.  The beer battered fish was quite tastey and came with a side of tarter.  The platter had 2 ample sized pieces of fish so you'll walk out full!  The service was attentive.  We were immediately greeted when we walked in by multiple hostesses and our server checked in often.    If you are looking to watch a game, you won't be disappointed.  There were TV's in every direction I turned my head.    Overall, Fitzgerald's gave me exactly what I expected.  I wasn't disappointed but it didn't leave me feeling like it was anything special.  I was hoping for somethng different, and unique in uptown Charlotte instead it is a cookie cutter pub.  I'd go back but I wouldn't say I HAVE to go back.  It's definitely a lot better than what it used to be so thanks Fitzgeralds for taking us up a notch!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Fitzgerald's, I'd been living in Middleton for about 17 months now and have driven past dozens of times. Finally I rounded up my crew (6 people) and we went out for an old fashioned Friday night fish fry. Before we enjoyed the dining experience we spent about an hour at the bar enjoying martini's and Spotted Cows.   I made reservations for 6:30 and went back to the host desk around 6:25 just to advise them we are at the bar and that I would bring the group back at 6:30. A younger girl accompanied and older woman and both of them ran the hostess station. The younger girl said \"okay\" and the older woman said, \"no!\" I thought who treats a customer like that? She said you can take this buzzer and wait up front. I the advised her that I made reservations for 630 and my group was ready. Finally at 640 when we had waited at the bar our buzzer goes off and we head back, one small problem, she advised me that they are two servers short. She says you may wait at your table. (I will say the bartender overheard me complain to my guests about the rude older host and he said she can be mean sometimes, wow).  So we head back and sit down and waited about 10 minutes before anyone finally acknowledged us. Our waitress stopped by and took drink orders and took our dinner orders. She brought the drinks out shortly after and about 15-20 minutes we had our fish.   The fish was good, you can get 2 piece baked or fried haddock for $12.00 or 3 piece baked or fried for $14.00. Two of my guests had the baked and they said it was delicious. The remaining four of us had fried and it was \"pretty good.\" It was flaky and had a good batter, the pieces were pretty good sized and the tartar sauce was, meh...   I was hoping for a stellar experience here, I really was. The place is schnazzy inside, I wished the service matched the decor."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about an amazing experience that went south because of a bartender at this establishment. I came to Fitzgerald's in Friday afternoon, March 16, with some friends. We had an amazing bartender, Tom, and I had a very enjoyable time. So, when a few friends suggested returning there on March 17, saint patricks day, it was a no brainer for me. The music was amazing, the drinks were flowing, and the people were beyond words. I was having an amazing time. The food at this place is good, so i decided to order some French fries and chicken. I asked the bartender how much the chicken  was, and he told me it was $10. I had the fries earlier, so I knew they were $3. When I got my bill, $16, I asked what happened. Simple math shows that $13 plus tax isn't $16. Now, it isn't a lot of money, but everyone works hard for what they spend, and when you ask about pricing, that's what you expect it to be. He scoffed at me and said \" what, am I suppose to know the price of everything here?\"  This idea is a novel one as he is an employee. Nonetheless, I paid the man, moved on, and tipped the bartender that bought me ketchup.  That's when it started. I waited for 25 minutes for a drink as he literally served everyone around me. When I called the other bartender, the one I had previously tipped, he told her not to serve me and then she refused to take my drink order. It took a stranger walking up and ordering my drink for me to get one. I would like to note that I was the ONLY African American in that area at the time. When another gentleman(African American), he also had to wait a long time for this bartender to pay him any attention. I digress. When I finally got his attention, and I said to him \" hey, I've been waiting a while to order a drink,\" he made a vulgar motion  to me and then said so what, and carried on. Truthfully, I would like to say that this is the worse part, but it's not going to be. I plan to call a manager on Monday, but let's face it; they won't do anything about this. I even mentioned it to a manager there at the time, and he said \" I don't know,\" and then kept walking. The other major issue is that this is a common occurrence here in Charlotte. I find that establishments such as these aren't held to the same standards of good customer service and DECENCY that I am used to back home. Does it disgust me that he treated his African American clients so poorly?  Does it disgust me that even after reporting it and writing a review, nothing will come of this?  No!  What disgusts me is that establishments no longer care that their people treat all other people as simple human beings. This was my first time to Fitzgerald, and sadly, it will be my last!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch after Genghis Khan exhibit and China First Emperor at IMAX.  I had only been here once during a basketball tourney, when it was packed.  This time, We had missed St. Patty's Day, so we had a great shepherd's pie, seriously cold Guinness and apple cobbler.  Food, service and atmosphere were all great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Your typical uptown sports bar. No real glitz or glamour, but none needed either. Mostly have visited pre- or post-Hornets game for beverages. The couple times I have ordered food, it has been good bar food.  Service has always been good, no issues. Will probably be able to flesh out my review soon because my alumni association's football watch parties are going to be held here starting this year. I'll get back to you guys!"}
{"text":"Fitzgerald's is a solid Pub to grab a drink before going to an event/game uptown. The beer list isn't extensive but they have some decent options. Their food and service are both average."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at Fitzgerald's, seems clean and the service has been good each time I've been there. However if you are looking for an Irish bar, go to Ri Ra's, it can't be beat.  That being said, Fitzgerald's is a great spot for nightlife that is away from the Epicenter."}
{"text":"I've been here before and was always pleased with the food, service and atmosohere. Today we only got 2 out of 3. The corned beef on the  Reuben was extremely tough and chewy. The cod sandrwich was greasy. New chef? Unsure if I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Great place to meet and watch sports. Even better place to go after the Panthers game.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food. I ordered the Reuben and it was terrible. The meat was like jerky, the cheese was barely melted and the rye bread seemed very lightly toasted. I didn't even give them a second chance at it. It's an Irish Pub. If you can't make a decent Reuben why have food at all. I had to eat something though so I went for fried mozzarella. That was awful as well.   The waitress, Lauren, was extremely nice and very apologetic about the Reuben. Her service was excellent.  On another note...  I was in town for a concert. My friend called in the early afternoon to see if they had anything going on there pre concert and they said no. Turns out the local radio station was having an event there for the concert.   I also received an email today that this establishment also failed to check me in through my OpenTable reservation.  HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"After an awesome Checker's game, our group decided to grab some  beer from somewhere nearby. We wound up at Fitzgerald's. The place was so slammed we couldn't even find a spot a the bar. After standing around and waiting for someone to clear out, we were lucky enough to get a table near the dj.   Beer was expensive, as to be expected downtown, but the spectacles were ceaseless. That is a GREAT place to people watch and have some laughs with your friends. The music was far too loud though; it made everyone succumb to a shouting match. The closer to midnight we approached, the dimmer the lights became, and people started dancing. This was hilarious! Good times... I left there in a happy mood, and recall fondly that great evening!"}
{"text":"Fun stop. Stopped by last weekend. Menu is pretty large. The burger i had was awesome and the fish and chips my friend had looked really good. Good drink specials too. Lots of tvs which was nice. The bartender was friendly and attentive. Overall i liked the place. will definitly be back sometime"}
{"text":"My husband and I always hit up fitzgeralds for drive thru prime rib.  Tonight we each got a 1/12 cm thick charred piece of meat.  I would be embarrassed to serve this!  We gave our beloved drive thru prime rib another shot and you totally redeemed yourselves!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! I've only lived in Charlotte a few months and luckily I found this place not long after moving. The friendly staff already know my name and the bartenders are quick to ask me for a drink if they haven't poured my favorite already. Fitz is my go-to spot before or during Hornets games. Right in the heart of Uptown, you really feel the excitement on game days since Fitz is just a short walk from the newly re-named Spectrum Center. Great spot for any and every football game as well, college or professional! Fitz has a plethora of TVs always on the most popular games and great appetizers and entrees to enjoy during all 4 quarters.  Just save yourself the trouble of trying to decide what to order and grab a Fitz Platter-- wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, sliders, and fried pickles. Also grab an order of buffalo chicken dip, you won't regret it. Fitz has one of the best reuben sandwiches I've ever had, but if you're feeling bold, try the Shillelagh burger-- a burger with a reuben on top. Guy Fieri would be proud. Nice drink specials daily, $6 burger lunch on Thursdays, and if you're looking for a late-night spot Uptown, Fitz has you covered there as well! Trivia every Wednesday night and DJs Friday and Saturday nights. Noticed one reviewer knocked Fitz as being \"the place everyone goes for free.\" Hmmm.... why would you not? Fitz is one of the largest bars in Uptown and forces no cover on you for entry. Of course I'd rather go to Fitz for free, instead of paying $10 to get inside a place smaller than my bedroom like The Local or Connolly's. That's just common sense, and not a negative but a positive for Fitz in my opinion. Fitz has enough room to be a bar, dance floor, and dining room all at the same time if it wanted. While being there, I've seen several rooms reserved for private events like after work happy hours at a private bar, or one of the dining rooms reserved for a big game watch party. If you're ever looking for a nice event space, I'd definitely recommend giving Fitzgerald's a call. They have plenty of room to accommodate your needs.  Bottom line: Fitzgerald's has everything I'm looking for in a local pub and more. 10/10 will go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, tons of TVs, the food is okay and nice drink specials. The service is great, the bartenders are all really cool and hot which is also a plus. Since it's not a corporate restaurant, I don't understand why the waitresses don't dress more attractive. It's like a sports bar vibe and the the waitresses are all very attractive but their clothes aren't. Not saying they should look like Hooters girls but at least show a little skin!"}
{"text":"There is nothing sadder than the death spiral of once well-run restaurant, but that is what you will experience here.  We had six in our party and were told there was an hour wait  (for an empty) restaurant.  We should have left then, but hoped they could pull it off. No. Salad bar has been reduced to a bowl of iceberg lettuce and few toppings.  All the topping containers were empty. Food came out one at a time so we were not able to actually eat our food together and the orders were 100% incorrect. My husband ordered 4 piece broasted chicken and was served 2 drumsticks and two backs.  Backs. The fish fry was inedible.  We paid up and left and will not return."}
{"text":"What is so special about the prime rib on Saturday night, it is the same price as the regular menu and you NOW have to pay extra for the salad bar. Include a dinner salad with your meals and then people can upgrade if they desire. Additionally the filet mignon was blah, had no taste, can't be getting your meat from UW Provisons."}
{"text":"Smack dab in the center of the theatre district stands Fitzgeralds Pub, an Irish pub with a great atmosphere! The sports are always on and the beer runs cold. The staff here are so friendly and strive to accommodate the customer. The food is always hot, fresh and prepared to order. We've been coming here for 2 years now and have never missed a visit to Fitzgeralds! The General Mgr, Nick strives for perfection and it shows. Don't miss this place when you are in Charlotte! Oh and by the way, sitting on the patio is PERFECT!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar. The staff goes out of their way to make you happy. I like sweet tea as a mixer, bit it's only available in the restaurant, and dumped when the kitchen closes. So they filled a couple of glasses to use for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Best corned beef and cabbage on the planet. This place is off the hook!!! Come prepared to have a good time. And St. Patrick's day to boot!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, which is unfortunate, because this is a great place close to the arena and other downtown venues, but not in the icky, overcrowded Epicenter.  I visited after an event at the arena, and was treated to sub-par service, and was told \"sit anywhere\" in the nearly empty pub, then kicked out of my table of choice because it was \"reserved\", despite there not being any sign of it being off limits.  Servers were mediocre, but it is a new place and they are probably still learning the ropes (like how to pronounce the Irish beer Smithwicks properly).    I just wasn't impressed, at all.  When you put the name \"Irish\" in your name, I expect more than a place that serves Guinness... the decor is very sleek and modern, but there is nothing sleek or modern about a true Irish pub.  My Smithwicks was served in a glass advertising some cheap, American beer.    The food was OK.  I was impressed they had vegetarian chili on the menu, and it was quite tasty, but nothing stood out from any of the five people's orders in my party.  Overall, it's just a really generic bar that's not a sports bar, or an Irish pub, or anything at all that would stand out in a crowd.  It reminded me of a hotel bar... you know, the kind that is just kind of convenient, but nothing out of the ordinary?  Because they are a sponsor of my favorite sports team, I may give them a second chance, but all in all, it's a pretty forgettable and bland establishment."}
{"text":"Always a fun place to stop by when I'm in this area of uptown. I've been coming for several years, and the friendly service has always remained the same. There are two bar areas and tons of TVs to whatever 'the game' happens to be at the time. Lots of local beers on tap as well. My go-to dish here is a spicy (buffalo) chicken wrap. Bonus: they will validate your parking if you stop inside and make a purchase."}
{"text":"This place looked like a fun place to watch a game, but the service was a bit lackluster. We were sat at a table outdoors, but it took about 15 minutes for a server to clear our table and greet us. Even after taking the dishes away, there were still several cheque folders on our table from the previous party. For an Irish pub, the Fish and Chips were very average. One member of our party had sediment at the bottom of her beer, but they comped that beer, so they earned some points there. A lot of places in Charlotte were closing early that night for \"staff outings\", so we landed here as our third or fourth choice. I'll try a different dish next time. The pork sliders looked very good, as did the burgers."}
{"text":"I probably come here too much for my own good, but I love the buffalo shrimp and mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"Long story short, been there for 30 minutes and finally we received two waters. There was 4 of us. We order two apps and three bloody Marys. 30 minutes later, no bloody Mary. Server finally came and told us they ran out of bloody mix. We decided to cancel our order and leave."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night round.  Great service.  Rachel makes the best Gimlet.  We will be back"}
{"text":"As much as I hate to say this.. I'm impressed. I'm a Browns fan (as you probably already know it's a ruff time) I'm going to put differences aside and I'm happy with the service. Our server Justin took great care of us! He was extremely attentive. Unfortunately, I can't give any critique about the food but alcohol and  service are on point. If you're looking for a place to hang out and grab a drink before a game or concert this is it."}
{"text":"Too bad the Steelers aren't in the playoffs because this place feels like Pittsburgh on football Sunday!  The football crowd is loud and fun, with a Steelers-friendly DJ to entertain during commercials.  They offer a great appetizer sampler (not your standard frozen food type) and a nice beer selection.  The bar is spacious yet cozy.  This is also a Penn State friendly bar...so if you dig the Steelers and Nittany Lions like we do, check this place out on gameday.  You'll be among friends!!  And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )"}
{"text":"So what use to be Buckhead is now Fitzgerald's.  Honestly, I walked in and was like \"nothing here has changed\".  Maybe there are a few more TV's?  That being said nothing really needed changing.  It's a decent place to grab a bit and watch the game if you have the chance.  They also do an all you can eat crab leg night (I think it's Wed?) and all though I haven't had the oppurtunity to try it out I plan to.    Touted as an irish pub I really don't get that feeling of anything relative to an irish pub while I'm there.  Maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Fun, lively atmosphere for a Saturday night.  We started out here for a girlfriends birthday and although we had slow service (they were busy), our server was attentive and the manager (James-you rock!) treated our party to a round of shots!  I didn't sample their food bites, but my friends had the chicken tenders and spinach dip and both looked awesome.  Definitely a cool place to hit while uptown when I just want to hang out and not get dressed up in heels and fancy-wear :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice bar close to spectrum center. We stopped in for drinks and appetizer. My mule was delicious. Service was friendly and fast. I would definitely visit again. TV on each table, station on golf. I wonder if i could have changed the channel??"}
{"text":"Swing through here for an early lunch while on a work trip. I was intrigued as they are part of the mileage dining plan.   I had the fried chicken sliders and French onion soup. The soup was good but a bit salty. The sliders however were great.   The staff was really friendly and it looks to be a great sports bar with all their TV's and lots of taps!"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here because it was very close to the wedding venue and there were football game on that night that everyone wanted to watch. We opted for a buffet style dinner for our group of 30 people. The food was AMAZING!! It far exceeded my expectations. The staff was nice and attentive  and took great care of our group. The negatives ... I wished that the private party room was actually private. While we knew it was going to be crowded that night with the Panthers playing a preseason game in town, it still would have been nice to have slightly more privacy. My husband I wanted to address our wedding party and parents but even standing up on a booth and yelling, no one could hear us. The biggest disappointment was the Air Conditioning... or lack thereof. It was SOOOOOOO hot in there. Everyone was sweating. We kept asking them to turn the air down and they kept saying they were. Then later in the night a server told us that the AC had been broken for weeks and that no one knew how to fix it and it was set on 30 degrees but the temperature in the restaurant was still 95 degrees. 95 DEGREES! and it felt every bit as hot. We asked them to prop open a door and at least get a breeze going but they said they were not allowed. Food was fabulous & everyone had a great time."}
{"text":"World Series game 7 and these clowns are playing a basketball game on every screen. When we asked if they were going to play the series they said only on our booth screen and with no sound. They were also out of about 25% of the beers we tried to order."}
{"text":"Boy, this place is bad.  For one thing, service is very weak. The hostesses and servers are negligent and, while not rude, certainly not well trained. They try to remember things, but it seems they can't.  Second, the food is very, very bland, fatty, and contains egregious amounts of cornstarch as a thickening agent.  The salad bar is somewhat unclean-looking.  The prices are sky-high. We paid $80 (including tip) for two people, and it's not like we went overboard.  You can get a LOT more for the same or less money (and spare your arteries) almost anywhere in town. Look elsewhere for vittles."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day brunch and it wasn't good at all. The French toast sticks and cookies were hard. For $20 a plate I def didn't get even enough food to fill my little tummy. The only thing that was semi ok was the Mac and cheese, that's only because I'm pretty sure it was easy mac."}
{"text":"It's hard to think of this place as something other than Buckhead so I think it is often over looked. But now that it's patio weather this place should definitely be on everyone's radar.  Stopped in  a small bite on the patio on a Sat afternoon. The wings were HUGE and delicious. We had the blackened parmesan and the the barbalo. I would recommend either depending on what you like. I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full after 4 of them.   The waitress was on top everyhing. We always had a full drink in front of us. Looking forward to my next a on their patio."}
{"text":"The only thing Irish about Fitzgerald's is their name and the fact that they serve Guinness.  Other than that, you can expect average food, average drink prices and mediocre service.  They have lots of TVs if you are there to watch a game.  The two times I've been here, there has been no waiting to get in.  Gee, wonder why?  Charlotte has too many options to settle for a \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight!!! food was delicious, our waitress was great! Kyle is awesome, he always checks in on his tables, and makes sure everyone is ok!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here before a concert at Spectrum. We were able to sit outside which was a blessing because the inside was a mess. We sat ourselves because the hostess was completely overwhelmed. When it looked settled, we went inside to ask for menus and to remind them we sat ourselves on the patio. 20 min later... our drink orders were taken. 20 min later... we got our drinks. My moms hard apple cider  came in a dirty glass with stuff floating in it. So yeah..   Surprisingly our food came out faster than our drinks. I ordered the pork sliders. They were okay. Nothing special.    I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Grew up in Middleton and this place has gone downhill!!  First off, what restaurant only has 6 servers on a Friday night fish fry??  So they made us wait an hour.  Server was incredibly slow.  The fish they brought out tasted like it came from a buffet or was under the heat lamps for a good 25 minutes. Had to send it back for some fresh fish.   Baked Potato lukewarm and too another 8 minutes to get sour cream for it.  I asked the lady at the salad bar if she could help, and she told me to ask my server.  Was surprised as she was older and this response is typical of the younger generations.  Very poorly managed at best!  Will never go again as there are too many restaurants in the area for fish frys!"}
{"text":"Bad service and worse food. The fried pickles are horrible...couldn't even eat past the first one. The only positive is that they validate the  $20 parking."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night at 6:15. We had tickets to an 8pm show at Belk. Seems doable, right? Well, imagine or surprise when at 7:40, we still had no food and worse yet, no sympathy from our waitress. It took us telling her that we needed food or we were leaving for her to finally produce something from the kitchen. The food that came out was worse than the service... Pitiful turkey sliders with a smear of browning guacamole on top that looked like snot, rubbery boneless chicken wings and cold fries. The only thing I'd consider eating again is the fried mozzarella (hand cut & breaded according to the menu). Needless to say, we will not be back and advise you fine folks to stay away! There are way too many fantastic restaurants nearby (Merts, Roosters, BLT Steak, etc. etc.) to suffer through Fitzgeralds."}
{"text":"I visited Fitzgeralds for the first time this past weekend. I was impressed! From the outside it looks like a small Irish pub but looks can be deceiving! It's much bigger than I imagined on the inside!   I can't speak for the food just yet since we only went for late night fun but I'll definitely be trying it soon!   But as for late night, I had a blast. The dj was awesome and he had the videos playing to the music all over the bar. He played some great throwback along with top 40. There were good specials going on and the bartenders were really friendly. We just danced all night which is just what you need sometimes!   We loved it so much we got tickets to the NYE party! So excited for this!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday night to grab a few drinks and it was packed. We finally managed to get a few beers and then later went back to get a rum and coke and a Long Island ice tea. Not sure if the bar tenders are actually trained in how to make drinks as the Long Island was far from what a true Long Island is and the rum and coke was more coke then rum. While we know it was busy - our service was horrible as the two female bar tenders were more concerned with chatting and assisting the younger crowd that was there. Won't be back."}
{"text":"It has been quite some time since I've hung out in the downtown Charlotte area - let alone try to visit the corner of 5th and College.  Even though Fitzgerald's replaced Buckhead's (a long time Charlotte staple since I've been here) I was taken aback at all the changes they made to the inside of the place.  They've classed it up a bit to make it much more than a bar... it's better suited for meals now.  It was funny being greeted by a hostess since I was just used to just going in and barring it up.  We were just planning on picking up tickets for an upcoming bar crawl, but we ended up eating dinner here.  The menu is quite large with some authentic Irish dishes.  I tried the Fish & Chips....  Usually I don't really expect much having been through my share of over-breaded, badly fried fish portions... but the breading here was nice and light with the fish perfectly cooked and moist.  The fries were nice a crispy too... way too many places present you with some cold, limp fries.  Lucky for us, Wednesday nights are Pint Nights!  all pints are $3 (with exception to Guinness... which made me somewhat sad).  It was still a good time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years -- it's got a great location! Right in the heart of uptown a block away from The Epicenter. However, I had never truly experienced Fitzgerald's until I watched The Steelers game there this past Saturday. Man oh man! Black and yellow wall to wall! Steelers fans are one-of-a-kind and can be a bit much so hat's off to Fitz for being the official Steelers bar in Charlotte. I'm sure they catch a lot of crap but they handled it very well. The waitress was nice and the bar service was surprisingly quick considering the crowds. I'll be back for sure.. though I'll make sure to wear black and yellow if Pittsburgh is playing!  I hear they've got food too so next time I'll have to sample some."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, big space with tons of TV's!  Even better...it's a Steeler's Bar!  They have a DJ that works during commercials.  The staff is friendly & on top of service.  They have Woodchuck on tap as well as Harp, Guinness & Smithwick's.  They also have a nice patio on the front of the restaurant.  The food looked decent, but basically bar food & we just went for drinks & the game, so I can't comment on the quality of it.  BONUS!!!  They validate your parking in the garage attached to their building!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! Ordered a drink.... flat and tasteless!  Bartender was more interested in taking with his buddy at the end of the bar and flirting with all the girls coming in than tend bar!   The special Bloody Mary came with no olive or celery it tasted like crap but I got to sit and listen to the Bartender talk crap about some customer who left his credit card referring to him as \"dick head\" while he kissed and hugged some under age appearing female patron!  Must be the reason there was only six people in the place!  I'm never coming here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked Fitzgerald's.  The service was great, the food was very tasty and the beer was cold and so good!  I had the Black & Blue sliders and they were delicious and my husband raved about the Steak Sandwich.   The restaurant has a very comfortable atmosphere.  Nice bar area with TVs and quite dining areas, too.  Great place for a night out with your honey or to meet up with a group of friends.   You also can't beat the location...central to Time Warner Arena, Blumenthal, and EpiCenter.   We are always looking for a place to eat whenever we are uptown for a sporting or theatrical event....looks like we have found our place!"}
{"text":"the fried pickle was only okay. their food just looked mediocre. their drinks, well their beer was alright.  if you're not from NC, make sure to ask for local brews and not your regular stuff because why the hell not"}
{"text":"God, they just try so hard. They have great specials, a huge space and it seems to be really easy to win a happy hour for your friends but this place is just always empty and when you have a giant empty bar it's hard to have fun.  CLT might just have too many irish bars for their to be room for this place but I wish them success because they look like they're doing everything they can to bring in more people."}
{"text":"Have you been to Stool Pigeons, Picasso's, or Fox and Hound Lately? Then you have been to Fitzgerald's only their dinner and drink service are not up to par. This place has zero zing... zero. There is nothing special about it and no reason other than the free parking to have a drink or eat there. Their best drink special of the day, a $3 Blue Moon, ran out by 8:15 on opening night and it wasn't nearly as busy as I have seen the old Buckheads get. .   The first Blue Moon I drank had an overwhelming taste/scent of onion as if someone cut an Orange with the safe knife or cutting board as they used to chop onions...gross. I did ask the server about it and so my second (yes I braved another) actually tasted much better.   I ordered the shrimp entree for $11.95. This was definitely an appetizer portion. I was served ten shrimp which were not very large on an appetizer plate with a side of cut up onions with a dash of mealy tomatoes and three small pieces (half of my pinky size) of browned avocado. I couldn't taste the lime and it was very-much under-seasoned. Eating a plate of mushy onions was not appetizing and therefore it mostly remained untouched on my plate. I didn't complain because I already felt bad for the onion-beer complaint but it was fairly obvious my side wasn't touched. The food quality was unacceptable.   Service was ok for a first night and I'm sure she probably was more than a bit nervous. A more nuanced server might have thought to comp the first beer or notice my side was still glaringly on my appetizer/entree plate...but I won't fault her too much since it was their grand opening and therefore an expected learning curve.  I will say the place looked nicer than Buckheads which is definitely a plus. I hope they get better...a lot better."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Fitzgerald's and so this place gets a slightly higher rating, but based on the reuben alone it would be a 1. It's a great place to drink and they do have some good food on the menu, but the reuben is not one of those things.  I continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte with a place I thought would have a good reuben, an Irish spot. I was quite wrong. The corned beef was terrible - it was this rubbery substance that was clearly boiled, poorly, and didn't have any flavor at all. The sandwich was soggy as the standard marbled rye wasn't crisped up at all, and the kraut just didn't add much to the sandwich as it lacked the proper tartness required. The sandwich was covered in melted cheese, but that can only do so much to make up for the rest of a bad sandwich.  Fitzgerald's is a good spot with decent food and a great atmosphere - just don't make the same mistake I did and order a reuben."}
{"text":"Come here periodically, food is always good, solid bar food! Tonight was a busy night and Clara* check my spelling* killed it. We had a large group but still great service! Will come back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Downtown (Uptown, whatever) is not really my stomping ground. The last time I was anywhere near this place, it was Buckhead (Saloon?), if that tells you much of anything. And while I did venture inside, it was only to use the facilities. The rest of the time, I was on the patio, which is nice.  I had a drink or three, and they were good enough, but the service, such as it is, wasn't the greatest I've seen. Could be because it was the patio. Could have been because it was the afternoon. Or it could be because you don't really go to this sort of place for the service, you know?"}
{"text":"Another first! Went a walk and came across here! Walked in and they were very friendly and the place was cool. It was hot outside!  Stop to have a beer and the bartender was a sweetheart! Good service and cold beer. I would recommend it here."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Fitzgerald's today. Stopped in before seeing a movie and was craving a burger. Highly recommend the A1 Burger- .   Decided to sit at the bar where Tom greeted me first thing. He let me sample the Sam Adam's 76 which was a tasty suggestion.   I will definitely be returning back to Fitzgerald's soon!"}
{"text":"I came here on a trip to see UNCC and got a bit hungry, so decided to check out the downtown area. The Mac and cheese and spinach and artichoke dip are DYNAMITE. I got very good service, but did not come during happy hour. They were doing a charity event to help with pediatric oncology so I decided to give them some money toward it. All staff was very, very kind knowing I'm not from around the area and helped me out a lot with the menu, since there's so much on it.i definitely would recommend coming here again at a quieter time if you had bad service. Definitely one of my top placed to back to when I move to CLT."}
{"text":"I've been trying to update some of my older reviews lately. While on the book of face today, I saw a flier for Fitz's three year anniversary party and thought it was time to re-visit this one.   Why this place wins: it's the closest restaurant/bar to TWC Arena AND they validate parking for the Wake Forest Garage. So, don't throw your garage ticket on the dashboard and remember to bring it inside with you. And when you bring it inside, don't forget to ask your server or bartender to validate the ticket for you.  Leaving the arena after a big event is always a pain, but especially know because of all the construction outside. I'll usually walk over to Fitz's for a drink after a game or show and wait for the traffic to clear. The patio is fantastic for people watching.  Menu-wise, I think the food has gotten better over the years. I usually order the Drop-Kick Chicken Sandwich. Buffalo sauce and bleu cheese make everything delicious. App wise I go with pretzel bites (beer mustard and queso dipping sauce FTW) and the wings. I mix hot and teriyaki sauces. I haven't had the chipotle mango, but it's next on my list to try.  Service can be hit or miss here. I've had good and not so good experiences here. This is a Penn State and Steelers bar. Steeler Sundays are nuts. Get there early. They also have IC Light for game day.  Looking at how this place has developed and changed over the past three years, I  would say this place is somewhere between a 3.5 and 4. I think they've earned that extra star."}
{"text":"Poor service. Poor quality food. Discussed specifics with manager. Indifferent attitude. For example wing appetizer was dried out. Sauce was flavorful but dry.  Explained my dissatisfaction to manager his response was \"some of our customers like Krispy wings.  Ok. So they are aware they cater to the overcooked Krispy wing crowd."}
{"text":"I have been there several times for Steelers games and have always had a very good experience with the food and staff.  My only complaint is the high price for drinks, especially on a Sunday."}
{"text":"If you like fresh, good, normal food check out the Brunch at Fitzgerald's. The restaurant is a nice break from the \"fancy & eccentric\" food from other places nearby. Food on brunch buffet is fresh, simple and some of the best I've had on a buffet in the Madison area. I would highly recommended a visit to Fitzgerald's any Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Don't even know why we went there but we regret it. The ambiance was cold dark and shabby.  The food was cold poor quality and poorly prepared.  There is nothing to recommend here.  It used to be a good place."}
{"text":"Where to start with such a great experience. The bar set up was dope really gave a home town feel to the restaurant. Started with the Fitzgerald's platter and hummus for an appetizer. The platter contains all my favorite things. Nice and hot too!!! Mozzarella cheese squares melted into long strips as you pulled it apart. The sweet and spicy wings were everything!!! Shout out to Paul Booker. Everyone should try the Mac and cheese plate. By far my favorite dish especially if you add salmon. Salmon was cooked to perfection. Shrimp Po boy was nice and crispy, full of flavor. Finished with a tiramisu cup life couldn't be sweeter!!! Thanks for the great service and experience Fitzgerald's. I can not wait to make it back to try more items."}
{"text":"This is a cool little joint to come to and grab a beer.  Relaxed atmosphere and can get pretty crazy and busy on the weekends.  The fact that Wake Forest is directly above it definitely helps that crowd."}
{"text":"Just re-opened with some of the same folks working that you will see in this video!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM98yYylDlE  Ordered a two inch cut of prime rib to go with all the trimmings (mashed taters, au jus, creamed corn and salad bar) and four pieces of broasted chicken with some french fires and cole slaw. It all was very tatsty as it used to be! And it only cost $19.75 total!  They even had a two for one coupon so I get the next meal free! WOW!!"}
{"text":"So, this place is more-deserving of three stars than the previous two-star rating.  I should be writing new reviews for the new places that I've been but I have to give a shout-out to Lauren S, the manager who reached out quickly after my previous rating.  Me and some peepz happened to be in the area so we dropped in to grab a few more drinks... opera at the Belk would've been pretty sweet, but $3 vodka happy hour wins when one is slightly already inebriated.  With no fat lady in sight, the night had just begun.    But this review is just over.  The place was really solid and the staff was perfectly fine.  Great service recovery.    dmo out"}
{"text":"I recently visited Fitzgeralds on a Friday night with some friends. When going to the bar to order, I saw that they had a special that read \"$3.50 Select Ales.\"  I ordered two, then watched as the bartender poured out two Miller Lites.  When she brought back the drinks, I explained that Miller Lite isn't an ale at all, but a pilsner (which is a style of lager.) She first asked \"What's the difference?\" When I explained the differences, she shrugged her shoulders and said, \"That's just what we call it,\" then walked off.  Beers can be split up into two categories: lagers and ales. Lagers (which include pilsners) use a bottom-fermenting yeast and have what the casual drinker would describe as a \"crisp\" taste, and ales (which include IPAs, porters, and stouts) use a top-fermenting yeast.   Even to the average beer drinker, this doesn't make sense. Getting a Miller Lite when you order an ale is like getting a tuna sandwich after you ordered the caviar.  At best, this is marketing laziness, at worst it's an outright lie."}
{"text":"Typically always a fun, lively atmosphere. I tend to travel here a lot before Charlotte Checkers games or after work for for their happy hour, which is half-priced apps til 6 or 7pm. And I really like that they validate parking after 5pm - a rariety in Uptown!  The happy hour is full of variety with plenty of options.The nachos plate is huge and definitely something to share. Smaller apps, like the ahi tuna or chicken fingers, are great for single serve. The only thing I've ever been turned off by has been the fried pickles. They taste as though they are simply tossed in flour and fried til brown... no seasoning to really speak of and a lack of flavor. But everything else is good to snack on!  My only complaint, and the reason for the 3 stars, is the service. I've been here no less than a dozen times and each time I typically get mediocre service and a few times, just down right rude servers. Coming from the service industry, if you are busy, no problem and I get it.   One insistance my friends and myself traveled to Fitz to start our Saturday night. The server was busy, which caused for slow service, but was friendly and you could tell she was trying. The manager James saw my friend in a birthday tiara and served us a round of shots - props to James for being awesome sauce! I still go here a good bit but know that if I have somewhere to be at a certain point, I usually dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've been to Fitzgerald's three times since my son started at UW.  We were looking for a place to get a good steak that was more of a homey, comfortable place rather than the upscale/glitz offered at a number of other steakhouses in the Madison area.  We were happy with our choice.  If you are looking for upscale/glitz or culinary innovation, this isn't the place for you.  The look is a little dated, but clean and well cared for.  I'm a little old fashioned I guess, when I go to a restaurant it is for the meal and not the \"experience.\"    Between myself and my family over the three visits we had a number of entrees, including prime rib, filet mignon, broasted chicken, barbeque ribs and fettuccini alfredo.  My daughter reported the fettuccini as mediocre, but each of the other entrees was tasty, cooked to specifications and well portioned.  We tried most of the side dishes and the only one we would not order again was the rice.  We had several appetizers including cheese curds and onion rings; all were very good.  Fresh, warm bread was served (and more offered when it was finished) and the soup/salad bar, while not extensive, was very good.  Prices weren't cheap, but were reasonable for what we got.  Service was very good without the pretentiousness we've encountered at more upscale places.    Not the place for everyone, I'm sure, but we were very happy with it and I'm sure we will go again the next time we are in town.  The Sunday brunch looks very interesting, I'd like to try that."}
{"text":"A good place to dance. The wife and I go there for that and some shots once in a while.   Went there with friends last month during the Rich & Bennett Pub Crawl too. Had a good time. Not sure what their food taste like so I'll probably update this once I try them. Nothing fancy or bad about it from our experience.  The DJ kills it with some latest and some NINETIES shiz. Makes us folks who crossed over to the third decade go crazy."}
{"text":"This place wasn't too shabby! Great environment to catch games and munch on some bar food. When I came here we sat at the back bar and the bartender was AMAZING. He was very attentive and personal!"}
{"text":"As someone who's uncle owned an Irish Pub back in the day, I am so trying to like this place.  After a bad experience a couple years back I decided to give it another try.  What I experienced on a Saturday night was deplorable.  Just as before, the service was anything but the friendly, welcoming atmosphere that goes with real Irish pubs.  Bartenders don't have to have a big phony smile but neither do they have to act like taking a simple drink order for one person is a huge, painful ordeal.  Then, as I was watching a closely contested sporting contest on one of their TVs, the place without warning turned into a cheesy dance club complete with unnecessarily risque and provocative images across the TV screens and songs with distasteful lyrics.   This type of objectification of women has no place in an establishment that advertises itself as an Irish pub.  Not surprisingly, it seemed to attract some low level rift raft with poor manners and objectionable attitudes.  After a previous bad review, management did respond and asked for some feedback.  I'm ready to offer that now.  My feedback is this.  Close this place down!  Right now!  Okay that's a bit extreme.  How about then changing the name at least away from an Irish Pub?  As a gesture of goodwill, I'm come up with a number of suggestions for a new name.

{"text":"Spend your money elsewhere--like at establishments with friendly staff, with kitchens who serve respectable food and with owners who believe in providing customer service.  This is hardly breaking news considering the litany of negative reviews already posted, but the new-ish owners/management will destroy what was once considered a friendly, tasty, neighborhood restaurant. The writing is on the wall.  The restaurant was about 10% full at 6pm on a Thursday night (ominous bad sign) and that was the high point of our evening. If out of sheer morbid curiosity you'd like to read more about our experience, read on:  1. Our waiter was clearly new and unprepared as he did not know the evening's dinner specials and \"had to check with someone,\" which meant he would need to come back.   2. He later brought an incorrect entree and actually argued with one of our diners on how he had taken the proper order--he later admitted he was wrong and then offered to replace it.  3. Two of our entrees came out at the same time, the third arrived 5 minutes later, and the fourth entree (grilled chicken) came out 10 minutes after that.  4. My baked potato was cooked perfectly--as was the black and crackled, golf ball sized rotten segment burgeoning from the top and staring at me.  5. When asked to speak to the manager, it took over 15 minutes for our waiter to find him, presumably because he was napping given that we were one of 5 tables.  6. While waiting for the manager to emerge, I elected to see the hostess who was busy on her phone and recognized my presence only after finishing texting her sentence.  7. The manager listened to my re-telling of our experience with a blank stare and asked, \"What would you like me to do?\"  Here's what I'd like for you to do... take pride in your business, make sure your employees are doing their jobs before putting them on the floor, and most of all, give a damn...or at least pretend to."}
{"text":"The scene was a Friday night out with my friends. I had quite a bit to drink so I got up to use the restroom. As I approached down the hallway, the music of the bar began to be replaced by music of a different sort. At some point I realized that the music was actually coming from the bathroom, however I was not at all prepared for what I was about too walk into. The bathroom attendant. Quite possibly the coolest MF I have ever seen, on par with Samuel Jackson, greeted me with a slight head tilt and a faint smile. This man was wearing sunglasses inside and shredding a Dj turn table while pumping soap and handing towels out. I was at the urinal vibing to no diggity down to my soul in the most epic piss I've ever taken. When finished I saw a collection of every candy and gum that you could imagine along with cologne, condoms, lotion, and raw unadulterated swag.  It's for this reason alone that I give 5 starts, cause I really don't no much about the place."}
{"text":"Now, I have to say I've only been here once for a Yelp event and I'm not sure if the chef that made our dinner is their house chef or a guy they brought with them... That being said, I'll comment more on the layout, service and overall vibe...  There is plenty of bar seating which likely makes this a cool place to come hang out... There's even a separate section with another bar up on risers and a dining area directly across from it... They do not have a way to cordon that off from the regular restaurant noise, though, so if you're trying to rent some space there, I would keep that in mind...   Their restrooms were pretty clean by Uptown bar standards and there were about 8 stalls, so I was definitely surprised and pleased with that... Normally, the lines are huge at a place like this, but that's got to help...   I'm going to tell you, the servers here were some of the best that I've encountered... Quick, frlendly and a lot of fun... They really seemed to want everyone to have a great experience and it showed...    They validate parking from the Wake Forest lot, so yay for that!  Who likes to pay for parking?  Not this lady...   I'll have to go back again to make sure the good food was really theirs, but I'll make sure to do an update when I get around to it!  Until then, this looks like a safe bet for some drinks and a nighttime hang..."}
{"text":"Fitzgerald's is the place to end up for many reasons. The first obvious reason is because they validate parking! All you have to do is buy a beer and boom your parking is paid for. A genius way to beat the high prices of parking around uptown. The parking lot you need to find is the Wake Forest deck, which is just down the street from it.   Another reason to stop here is if you are a Steelers fan (or Penn State). Game day here is the Steelers HQ. So weekends when there is college and pro football it's going to be a hopping place. Charlotte seems to have a LOT Of Steeler fans.   Throughout the week, Fitz has some really great deals including their burgers that go on special on Tuesday. Make it out for their pint night and play some trivia. They give away really awesome prizes!   Also make a pit stop before a Hornets game and buy cheaper food and drinks then when you walk into the stadium and prices skyrocket. Don't forget to enjoy their outdoor patio seating that's nice and perfect for watching the streets of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back, nor will I ever go back to Fitzgeralds.  Their New Years Eve event was the worst that I've ever attended.  I've been trying to get a refund of my ticket price because I didn't get even close to my money's worth due to a dangerously over capacity crowd, a glassware shortage, slow bartenders, and a \"breakfast buffet\" that never materialized.  I've been trying to resolve this issue with the manager, Mike Palmer, and all he did was offer me a coupon to return and \"give Fitzgeralds another try\".  The problem is that I don't want to go back and eat/drink in an establishment like Fitzgeralds.  I would simply like either the manager or the owner to call me, which I've requested at least a half dozen times since the event, but I still haven't heard from anyone.  Even if there is no refund, I would still like them to answer simple questions like why were the bartenders overserving patrons that night (I routinely saw single customers order 4 or more drinks at a time), how many tickets were sold vs. the max capacity of the venue, and what officials witnessed the crowd that night and deemed it safe to continue selling tickets or letting patrons enter the building.  Very dissapointing customer service, very irresponsible way to run a bar/restaurant.  Very upset customers."}
{"text":"Came here on a suggestion from our uber driver, we wanted to watch the game and get some food. Starting at 9pm they start their late night menu which consisted of chicken tenders, chicken wings, or fries.   Service wasn't great, we had to ask a few different times to ensure our drinks and part of our food order was on our way out. The chicken tenders were to die for, the chicken wings were disappointing for a sports bar.   Plenty of TVs and good atmosphere but the rest kind of fell short."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar. This is the official Penn State bar, so I've come here a couple times now with my bf who's an alumni. Not sure if this is just a game day thing, but they have beer towers (~100 oz of beer in this cute little dispenser) of Yuengling, Miller, Blue Moon, etc for $20-22!!!!! That's like 6-7 beers right at your disposal! I've never seen this before so I think it's pretty neat. All the booths have TV's with the games playing that are built-in, which is also super neat.  As for food - it's pretty decent bar food. The boneless wings are good and I've also had the Carolina burger. Not very Carolina-y or particularly tasty, but good enough. Sweet potato fries were pretty standard, a little soggy. The atmosphere is pretty fun for night games - there was a DJ playing good tunes and we were partying everywhere. Overall a good place to watch football games and have fun."}
{"text":"In town visiting from Atlanta and came by Fitzgerald's. They have great food options, although I wasn't too pleased with the quinoa cranberry salad (too bland in my opinion) and the Shepard's pie (not what I expected). Our waitress, Stephanie, was absolutely amazing and had great customer service! My mom, who is very picky with her drinks, ordered their margarita and was very pleased. Overall, good place to drop by."}
{"text":"The service was great went for a late dinner ... it was warm so we say outside... I got the Dublin Broil... that I would give 5 stars to! My boyfriend got the the Shepard's pie... was good but not as good as mine. The beer was good my loppyrita was not that great had the guiness shot my boyfriend loved it... I had to sip mine ;) would go back again I have heard it gets crazy on holidays and sporting events so I wouldn't go then."}
{"text":"Worst meal and experience I have ever had at a supper club.  I grew up going to Fitzgerald's and had continued to frequent it as an adult.  This week we stopped in for the ribs and chicken special.  I was so excited for a great meal.   Service was poor, and that is being nice.   Water tasted off.  Server admitted the ice machine was broken and they knew about it but kept using the ice.   Ribs were inedible. They were covered with a dry rub that was basically just handfuls of cumin and smoked paprika.  In addition to the taste being terrible, they were dry and uninspired.   Chicken was awful.  Not only was the chicken overcooked to the point that the breading was burnt but you could taste how old the oil was. Worst broasted chicken I have ever had.  Salad bar...what a joke.  Old items, brown cauliflower, overly salty soup, poorly presented.    We were not at all happy with the meal but couldn't share our feedback because our server was no where to be found.  Finally at the end she comes to us and I casually tell her about my experience.  She takes my credit card, vanishes for 15 min, and then charges me full price. No manager table touch. No communication. Nothing.  So I then have to take the receipt and go find a manager.  He lacks the knowledge of good customer service.  His solution to the problem is a free dessert to take home, well that is crazy.  Fix the problem don't try to ignore it.  Finally after a long conversation I was given the refund and I vow to never return.  Anyone in the service industry just please follow this tip if a customer isn't happy...LAST - Listen, Apologize, Solve, Thank.  If the manager would have done these 4 things I wouldn't be writing this review.   So sad to see a once great, destination restaurant fall to such a sad sight."}
{"text":"I hope we caught them on an off night..  After walking around for about a half an hour trying to find a restaurant to grab dinner and drinks at before seeing a show at the Time Warner Cable Arena on a Sunday night we found Fitzgerald's which looked like an Irish Sports Bar with a great outside patio area.  We made our way to the hostess stand and asked if we could sit outside, the hostess looked very overwhelmed and wasn't even aware that there were tables outside hat were open. We made our way over to the tables and pushed them together and waited for someone to come clean them off - after about 5 minutes we sat down and pushed all the dirty dishes/glasses/checks to the end of the table. We had to go up and ask for a waitress twice and finally someone came over and took our order - leaving the dirty items and without wiping the table off. Our waitress came back a few minutes later to inform one of the members of our group that their beer choice was out, but didn't bring anyone else their drinks...  Our waitress then took our dinner orders and finally brought our beers, the member of our group who had who's original choice was out, received their drink with sentiment floating around and setting at the bottom...  Food was decent but the whole experience left a bad impression on all of us,I doubt anyone will return to this establishment if we are in the Charlotte area again."}
{"text":"I came here because this was a spot to meet for a bar crawl.   Me and the boyfriend ordered the sampler/appetizer platter and it was HUGE. Me and the boyfriend were definitely satisfied. We ordered beers with no complaints. Nice and cool in a clean glass.  Service was average.   I don't really have much to say, not because it wasn't good- there isn't anything special about this spot. I think everyone has that go to spot where you get what you need, nothing more and nothing less... This is one of those places.   I will say that if you're into people watching, this is a great spot to eat outside."}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. Shepard's pie was soupy and mushy. Only went here because I had a coupon for $25 off. Well, at least I know where not to go next time"}
{"text":"Slow service! Football games are on, and if you're in a booth, you have a personal TV!  Coming here during lunch might be a better bet than coming here on game day. Our service was beyond horrendous and we had to ask our server (or any server we could find for that matter) about our drink order several times before it coming over. We were about to leave, right as the drinks came over-- talk about convenient.   It would be hard for me to reccomend this place or even come back here at all. I was so appulded with the lack of service, even before sitting down, that we should have walked through that door."}
{"text":"I dropped in to catch up with a college friend. It's pretty noisy during happy hour, but what do you except - it's HAPPY HOUR! It looks like all of the businessmen of the downtown area hangs out here right around 4:45-6pm.   My drinks were well-mixed and strong = score! They validate parking AFTER FIVE. Don't get here 5min. early or else your parking is only discounted at $3/hr. I would probably check this place out again since my bartender Zane makes the best drinks in the bar!"}
{"text":"A large place to go and watch the Penn State Football Games.   The Penn State group in charlotte hosts their meetups and game watching at this bar, and that is what brought me into the bar.     The bar is styled after a Irish PUB, with 1 large bar, 1 small bar and lots of sectioned off seating.   Overall, its a nice place, clean and seem to draw in lots of people from around the uptown area.     Beer prices were normal with \"going out uptown\" prices.   Food was another story, I eat here a couple times and each time the food was pretty bland.  The mac and cheese was really bad.  The breaded Chicken fingers just tasted oily, same with the fish and chips.  Bottom line for me on this place: come to drink and hanging out, but go get some food else where.  TIP:  Bartenders at the Big bar validate parking for the parking garage."}
{"text":"Very sad to see how this restaurant has gone downhill.  Hubby & I stopped in on Sat. 1/7/17 for prime rib.  Noticed the parking lot was pretty empty, not a good sign.  Had a drink in the bar and were planning to go to the dining room when one of the bartenders told us the dining room was closed (on a Sat. night!!) and we would have to eat in the bar area, we could either stay at our pub table (with a loud TV blaring over my head) or move to one of the tables in the seating area just off the bar which is what we did.  The 2 bartenders were also the only 2 wait staff.  I ordered a pinot grigio, was told the only white wines were chardonnay or prairie fume.  I asked for a red and the waitress said \"we have merlot.\"  Ordered a glass along with water, she turned & left and my husband was not asked what he wanted.  Waitress came back (no drinks) to take our order, we both ordered prime rib.  I asked for a side of rice (listed on the menu) but was told they didn't have any rice so I chose a baked potato.  My husband ordered hash browns.  I also ordered a side salad.  Waitress came back very quickly (still no drinks) and said I could have the salad bar at no extra cost, I said I didn't want the salad but she said it was the same price so that was my choice.  Went into the freezing dining room (guess it was a good thing we weren't eating in there!), the salad bar had shredded lettuce with a few toppings.  Got our meals very quickly along with my wine and water.  My husband went up to the bar to ask for water but the 2 bartenders/waitresses were in a conversation and after a short time he gave up as he didn't want his meal to get cold.  Both prime ribs had a lot of fat but very little flavor.  No au just served with them.  No bread for the table.  My potato was inedible - probably because it was very old and had black on the potato (not the skin).  My husband's hash browns were OK.  We never saw our server until my hubby flagged her down for our check.  Never got my water refilled (it was served in a highball glass so it wasn't a big glass of water), the dirty salad plate was never cleared away, no one asked how our meals were or if the prime rib was done as ordered, etc.  A large group (12 or 14) came in after us and I heard their waitress/bartender say that \"a waitress had called in sick so we're doing double duty.\"  What? - a supper club has only 1 waitress scheduled for a Saturday night???  We will not be back and I won't be surprised if I soon read that this place has closed."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.  The food was good I had the special for Friday, which was salmon, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  What was not so pleasant were the flies that kept circling around our food.  This made the experience very unpleasant having to keep fanning flies away.  We reported to the manager who didn't seemed concerned and said that she would close the door.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"This is only a review for a Sunday during football season as that's the only time I've been there. We were in town and wanted a Steelers bar to watch the wild card game. This place was so fun. We arrived about 30 mins before the game not knowing how busy it gets. We couldn't find a table but we found a good little area to pop up shop for the game. The bartenders were efficient and friendly. The patrons were equally nice. One guy even gave up his barstool to let me sit down. If you're in Charlotte and love the black and yellow, head here...just get there early!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for before Hornets games! Justin at the upper bar is very attentive too."}
{"text":"We arrived here early on a Friday evening for a fish fry. Since the dining room wasn't yet open for seating, we sat at the bar and had a couple drinks. Drinks were good and service was prompt because there was really nobody else there at that time. My companion and I both like that Fitzgerald's is one of the few supper clubs in Madison where you can get a full salad bar, a well-crafted Old Fashioned, and a loaf of bread comes standard with every meal. The salad bar is pretty decent and one can make a meal out of that alone as it includes two soup options. We enjoyed nice conversation and delicious food in the warm ambiance of this restaurant. Although the prices are not cheap, you do get quite a bit of food for the price and it's a large enough place that you can relax and not feel rushed"}
{"text":"This place gets an additional star for location. Right next to TimeWarner Arena and a big parking deck.  James & I stopped in here for a beverage and appetizer prior to the Bobcats and Jazz.  It was busy but we got seated quickly and the service was friendly and professional. We had the  grilled chicken tenders which were good.  An easy walk less than five minutes to the arena. They also have a agreement with the Wake Forest parking garage, free validation from 5p to 3a daily."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the UNC/Duke game.  Easily found a spot and met some friends.  The pub ambiance works well.  The restaurant is actually huge.  I was really surprised to see all of the space that they have because it doesn't feel big from the outside.  We basically just had beers and apps.  I expected a broader beer menu with some local choices but that wasn't really the case.  Nonetheless, the beer special of the night was $3 pints.  That's totally acceptable.  The only food we got was pretzel bites.  They came with queso and beer mustard.  Overall, I was pleased.  It was a pretty big basket and we were certainly satisfied.  The service was hit or miss.  Our waitress was pretty flighty.  I would return to Fitzgerald's.  It's not terribly fru-fru which I appreciate."}
