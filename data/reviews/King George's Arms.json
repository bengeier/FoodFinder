{"text":"Good cold beers. Terrific wings on wing night and peameal, sandwich. Great fries and terrific service. Definitely recommend ."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Scarborough for wings!  My bf and I were in the Sleep Country when one of the associates walked in with takeout wings for lunch.  It smelled so good!! We asked her where she bought them and she said the pub next door.  Being huge wings fans, the wings made such an impression on us that once we left Sleep Country, we decided to try the wings at the pub.  These wings were amazing!  You won't get the hundreds of flavours offered by All Stars and Wild Wings but what you will get is perfectly cooked, juicy and crispy wings.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It's a really small and cozy pub.    Thursdays, wings are half priced from 4 to 6pm which is more the reason to give it a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite local hangout. Food's great, staff is the best. No need to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Second time here in a week while in town on business. Small but comfortable.  Huge selection of beers on tap. Very nice place. Sports on all TVs which is perfect. It's a local bar but very inviting. Staff are great and fish and chips is sensational. Garden salad was very fresh. Menu is extensive from steak to traditional pub dishes. I have nothing negative to say and wish this place was in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Pro: The waitress was friendly. It seemed like a place that has more \"locals\" than random drop ins like my date and I (which is quaint in a way). Service was o-k. Not crazy prompt but not uber slow either. Also -  I was definitely diggin' the 90s jams that were playing so bonus points for music choice.  Cons: The french onion soup was pretty bland and pedestrian. The beef dip was also not great (I honestly would have rather gone to Arby's). My date wasn't crazy about his meal either and felt the same about the taste. I probably should have just had the wings and people seem to rave about those. Lesson learned.   I'd likely give it one more shot to try the wings (as I looooove me some wings) - but I can't say that I was terribly impressed with the food options we ordered."}
{"text":"Funny thing is, about 200 yards away, there is Queens Head, here we have King George's Arms.  Pick your favorite Royal and Body part!!!  Bottoms up  Lol.  Been dipping in and outta here for about 12 years if I can recall correctly.  The key to this place that makes it different, is they have a very good Halibut (thank God not Haddock) Fish and hand cut chips, and this disposition for having Dimmer Lights than everywhere else in Toronto.   Need a nooner Guinness, want it to feel like night, come here :).  Want an evening with Dim Lights, come here.  It kinda just works.  I like this place not expecting much more than a pub from it.  I think it has its own sort of cool dim being, so I come here for exactly a Guinness and Fish and Chips, never went off that exact order on the menu."}
{"text":"The food here was just okay nothing special but there server was nice. May or may not go back. Indifferent to be honest."}
{"text":"This place had that old pub smell right when you enter. But the space also stops when you walk in. It is super tiny,  ice try in the mirrored walls to give the illusion of a bigger place.   The drinks were ok. But can you go wrong with a gin n tonic ?  The coffee was decent. We didn't get any food because we only went to watch the game.   The server was great. We asked to change one of the channels to the golf game. Some at the bar complained but she didn't care ! One star is just for her.    I wish I had more to say. Wouldn't go back for any reason. The King's Queen is not too far and much larger.  Just go there."}
{"text":"Great wings.  Smaller place but just go on slower nights."}
{"text":"Slow service....took 40 min for wings...waitress doesn't even let us know until we inquired...horrible ...never gonna return  Waitress said wings are coming right up but lied...took another 10 min...wasn't even a packed house"}
{"text":"This place has great food (just had the Souvlaki special, but the other pub fare I've tried was really good, too).They obviously clean the pipes, cause every time I have a Stella here, it's clean and crisp. Can't beat the location for ease of access. And, as an added bonus, they don't play gangsta rap. The staff is friendly and efficient. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Coming here with my buddy for some drinks and wings, KGA has half price wings Monday to Thursday after 4pm.  The ambiance is small, comfy and quite dim but most of all clean and tidy. Their service was good, so no complaints! Taking advantage of the special we ordered 2lbs each, one Cajun and the other honey and spice. The wings are well proportioned and not small mini wings which makes the food experience all the more fun. Cajun was a dry rub, 3.5/5, not overly seasoned, but well packed with enough flavors and not spicy. Honey and spice about a 4/5, on the more gravy side, great balance of sweet with a hint of spice. Quite enjoyable and definitely something I'd order again. Aside from their wings, which they're known for,  keep in mind they've got a great selection of pub fares, classic pot pies to Rueben sandwich!"}
{"text":"Over 45 minutes for wings when it wasn't even a quarter full in the place?  Waitress didn't check on us nor let us know to at least say the kitchen was backed up.  I came here cuz of yelp and I hope people read this on yelp so they don't make the same mistake I did. All the tables around us got their food and we were waiting around starving and wondering if our order was even rung in. We finally ask the waitress if our food is coming and she says an second. Wait another 5 minutes and then she comes to say there are only 2 fryers in the kitchen and they're all being used up.  Really? Everyone seems to have gotten their food except us.  How long does it take to fry things? Give me a break. Absolutely horrible experience. Not worth it. If u want wings better go to st.Louis or another place with wing specials."}
{"text":"Small pub serving some of the best wings in Scarborough.  King George's Arms is this small pub across the street from Queen's Head Pub (odd names). The place itself is small and narrow on the inside, with a bar that takes up half the space. But it's got a warm cozy feel to it, and that feeling gets better when you grab a plate of their wings.   The chicken wings here come with your standard flavors, though they do have a flavor hotter than suicide (with a name that escapes me at the moment). Feeling wimpy at the time, I opted with just Hot. The wings themselves are nice big plump pieces of chicken. These wings were taken from chickens that must have been fed steroids because they were fairly large. A pound of wings comes with about 7-8 wings, but they are large and I enjoy those much more than 10-12 tiny ones. The sauce wasn't spicy, to me, and was not overpowering at all.   I also ordered a side of fries and the portion size for those are big. Easily shareable between 2 people. The fries are freshly (and roughly) cut potatoes that were slightly greasy but wonderful all the same.   Fantastic wings. Service was slow, even though the place was pretty empty, but server was nice though. A pound of wings will run you about $11, but come on a Monday night as Wings are half off!! Make sure you come after 5 pm when the deal is valid. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly little pub. Very busy with the lunch and post work crowds. Excellent wings.   (Actual address is 2501 Victoria Park.)"}
{"text":"Homophobic place. Their staff is just pathetic. It's 2018 and I'm so disgusted by their behaviour. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Small and perfect size. The type of people who are usually there are friendly and there are always sports on when you need them. Beer is good, food is okay but I like it most for its quaint demeanour."}
{"text":"One of our favorite nearby spots. The menu is small but diverse enough that we never get bored. Everything is cooked to satisfaction, the fries are the perfect amount of crispiness in wedge shape with some tasty dipping sauces that the husband and I can't get enough of! The Wings are our second favorite menu item -- but honestly, I don't think we've ever been disappointed with anything we've ordered.   Very friendly staff that are quick on service/drink refills, the booths are comfy and the music isn't too loud. There are also a group of regulars that love sports (I believe they have regular sports pools going on with them) so we obviously aren't the only ones hooked. :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this pub, the main waitress there has always been so kind to me. Until today when I went in and she was talking with a couple patrons about whether I was a boy or girl. Made me feel incredibly unwelcomed and awful. There were other words said, but needless to say I will never return there. So disappointing and hurtful."}
