{"text":"Mykonos is now CLOSED.   I went by there 2 weeks ago with my Father , had fond memories of this place from when I was a kid. Doors were locked at 7 on a friday night. On closer inspection the place was deserted and torn up. Internet search revealed that indeed it had permanently closed."}
{"text":"You want GREAT Greek dining and a terrific atmosphire? This is the place to go.  I stumbled upon Mykonos by accident one day and have been back many times. Great service and even better food! It feels like they treated us like part of the family every time we visited.  The prices are what you'd expect for a good night out, not to high, to say the least, just over a hundred for 2 of us, with drinks! They even have a belly dancer that comes out later in the night! That was enough in its self to get me to go back."}
{"text":"Husby and I went to celebrate one of my girlfriend's birthday at Mykonos Greek Restaurant.    I will admit that although I love the taste of Greek food, I was nervous.  Over 10 years ago, when I was attending High school, I found a Greek \"fast food\" place and their rice with tzatziki sauce was absolutely addicting!  The owner has since stopped working at that place and has hired others and ever since then the food never quite met up to his standards.  The food would be tasty but dry and tough to chew.  I've also tried other Greek restaurants and same problem.  Needless to say, I wasn't too excited about going to Mykonos.  I didn't eat anything all day so I ordered the Mykono's Special which comes with Moussaka, lamb chops, green beans, spinach cheese pie, and pilaf rice.  I felt prepared and ready as I was wearing my elastic waist skirt that evening.  Husby ordered the Lamb chops and was already drooling thinking about his meal.    The restaurant had a dark and cozy ambiance and was quite busy.  We waited for a good while for our food to come - almost an hour or so which is expected, I guess.  There were 13 of us and a packed dining room.  Our servers didn't appear to be happy to be there and they didn't really check on us all that often.  I wanted to order another drink when one did come by but I had to keep repeating myself as she didn't seem to hear me.  And when I finally did catch her attention, she didn't seem happy that I had to trouble her.  Oh, well, everyone has their bad days I guess.  Husby and I were the very last ones at the table to eat.  We received our plates a good 15 minutes after everyone received their food so we were already drooling by the time our food arrived.  I tasted the spinach cheese pie first as I was really looking forward to it.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting but it was not bad.  It had a nice strong taste to it that I'm sure others would appreciate.  But everything else was absolutely AMAZING!!!  The Moussaka had an awesome home-cooked feel to it.  The flavours and spices were very rich and deep.  I actually closed my eyes on the last bite to savour the flavour.  The lamb was succulent and melted in my mouth.  Not tough to chew at all.  I ate everything on my plate except for my vegetables...  not because Dad wasn't there to make sure that I would eat them, but because my plate had a LOT of soul food.  Elastic waist skirt or not, I couldn't finish even when I did want to.  They also had a belly dancer that came in while we were eating.  Husby was the only male at our table so the belly dancer wrapped her scarf around him and told him he should at least dance for his \"harem.\"  He was reluctant but I pushed him up there with her - It was a great distraction so I could steal bites off his plate.  His lamb was pulled off the bone and soooo juicy!  I almost cried with the first sample.  The marinade was well woven into the fibers of meat,  that I'm actually drooling as I'm typing this.    The service that we received wasn't the greatest that night but the food more than made up for it.  Just remember, no restaurant is perfect.  I usually prefer to take my business where I don't feel nervous to trouble our server for a second drink, but the food there is soooo good, I can definitely suck it up for next time."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place didn't have people here on a Monday night; Imagine we were the only people in the whole restaurant.   This place needs more traffic, it is definitely underrated as I had a very nice huge meal, the service was excellent and my arm was sore from throwing a bowl into the fire pit.  Mykonos is hard to miss, sitting directly on Centre Street with a huge looming neon light.   There are two places to venture into the lounge and the restaurant.  My stomach growled the restaurant, so we picked a nice spacious table for two in the blue and white motif.  A candle was lit and we were brought menus right away by our very nice server Wayne.  The bread that is placed on your table is worth the meal in itself, this is high quality fibrous bread that is delicious and almost has sweetness to it.  I ordered the Souvlaki Dinner which had two tremendous skewer portions of pork marinated in herbs and spices, a large Greek salad and hearty roasted potatoes.  My friend had the Lamb Shish Kabob which was marinated chunks of lean tender meat, green peppers, onions and tomatoes, roasted potatoes and rice pilaf.  Both platters were big enough to keep us from conversation and full enough from ordering the Chocolate Lava Cake.  Wayne was both warm and friendly and we found out later that he was tending bar plus serving us so his service must have been immaculate because we didn't even notice.  Then when we asked for the bill,  two bowls were set for us to throw at the fire pit and yell \"Opa\" for good luck.    This is an exciting prospect, I have never hurled anything for no reason so to pitch a fine chuck and crash was so exhilarating for both my friend and I.  I think Wayne noticed our glee that he gave us two more bowls but we decided instead to keep them as tokens of our fine meal and experience in Mykonos.  Definitely an amazing and non forgettable meal to say the least."}

{"text":"I've had great experiences at Mykonos, but also bad ones.  The food is usually amazing, the service is generally excellent, and the belly dancer is always annoying.  Beware of the guests screaming Opa! and throwing a plate in the fireplace.  It is loud and will scare the souvlaki right off your fork.  We went on my birthday last year and waited over an hour for food.  Granted, it was a night where there was a special and two people at our table ordered it, but the fact it took them 40 minutes before updating us was too long.  When our food arrived, only one of the six plates was as hot as we would expect -- the rest had obviously been waiting under an ineffective heat lamp.  Try the Mythos beer -- it's light, but with a lot of flavour.  When the kitchen is on, this place is fantastic.  It seems to be family-run, and there is one waiter (he's probably about 22-25) who is very helpful.  Again, avoid eye contact with the belly dancer."}
