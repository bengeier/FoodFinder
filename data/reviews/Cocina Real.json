{"text":"We have been to cocina real a few times and find that there are two things to order.  Number 1 is the nachos con mariscos.  Enough for two with plenty of chips, cheese and seafood ( shrimp and scallops).  The other thing to order is a margarita, especially on 2 for 1 Tuesdays and Thursdays.  We have tried other menu items and found them to be utterly terrible ( we have not tried the fresh guacamole).  We have noted thst kids do seem to like other menu items...  So, get nachos con mariscos and margaritas and you will love this place!"}
{"text":"The tableside guacamole is 5 stars. Lime margaritas are good enough to drink but nothing to rave about.  The food is below average, can't tell the difference between a burrito or an enchilada, tamale had too much corn, sauces were below average. Mostly just ground beef with little seasoning rolled up in a tortilla with tomato sauce.  Beans and rice were below average, bland and runny.  If I come back it'll just be for margaritas and guacamole, maybe try some other appetizers, but not a good place for dinner.  Atmosphere could improve, the restaurant had music but the kitchen staff were also playing loud music so it was like listening to two songs at once at the same volume.  Wait staff was attentive but not as helpful as they should have been. I ordered a side of rice and beans thinking it would be $2-3 but instead they gave me two large plates for a total of $6. Wasn't happy about that and wish the waiter would have said something"}
{"text":"Customer service lacks.  Chips are good.  Enchilada sauce is canned.  Beef in the Rio Grande burrito is canned.  Food is not made from fresh ingredients.  Try another spot."}
{"text":"I would stay away.  This was the worst Mexican food experience I have ever had, including Taco Bell and other fast food.  Service was painfully slow, even getting seated or water and chips.  Chips were bland and salsa even blander.  The burrito fajita came after a 20 minute wait and was disgusting.  No other word for it.  It was drenched with sour cream, soggy from the grease, and the ingredients tasted as if they were from a local school cafeteria.  I couldn't finish more than one bite.  The server stopped by after another 10 minutes, and I asked for my check.  No concern for the quality of my meal or even a thought for my experience.  Eat at Taqueria Guadalajara on Park St. instead."}
{"text":"Average food, acceptable service. No public wifi makes a return trip unlikely as there is better Mexican fare."}
{"text":"My daughter and I  this place! Great service, food is excellent! Chips are warm and fresh! Been going here since we moved to Madison almost 2 years now"}
{"text":"Sorry to have to post this. We have patronized Cocina Real (formerly Mi Concina) happily for many years. Food is consistent, service is always fast, the chips are yummy. HOWEVER, it has come to light that this company owes tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of unpaid wages. I hope they will correct this and address the issue publicly. Until those two things happen, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Slower than a dying snail in the Tijuana heat.  Went there for lunch, ordered and had to leave 40 minutes later because my food never showed up.  At least I got a few chips to eat.  Gotta love not being able to have lunch on your lunch break.  I will never go there again.    Gracias for nothing."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  We asked for margaritas - they brought  the large . We were not asked what size we wanted. So we were suprised when the bill came.  The guacamole that was made at the table was dull and lacked taste. The waiter was consumed with a conversation at the bar. He seemed annoyed to have to wait on us.  Ordered a combo platter which was cold on the inside. So it seemed to have been microwaved. Discussed this with the waiter when we finally got his attention.  He muttered something in Spanish took the plate back.  15 min later the plate was brought back.  Yuck now over microwaved.  Couldn't Wait to leave. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Cocina Real is about 10 minutes walking distance from my home and I eat there often. Been going there for 10 years. They offer reliably good, not great, Mexican food for a reasonable price.  I usually have enchiladas or one of the seafood specials. One of my particular favorites is the Enchiladas Sonora, which has smoked chicken, spinach, poblano peppers, and pinto beans with verde sauce.   A recent addition to the menu is a soup that has broiled shrimp, chicken, rice, and fresh slices of avocado. I REALLY like that. It's medium spicy so it probably isn't for everyone's taste.  My next project is to test fire all their chicken entrees.   This place isn't particularly fancy but I have found it to be a good value for the money. I've always had good service too, but I usually come on Monday evenings when it isn't particularly busy, either."}
{"text":"They are so lucky that the food down to the chips and salsa are to die for. Their service is ALWAYS horrible!!! Tonight I went in to order some take out and waited 15 minutes! The server checked with me when I got there and said he'd be back in two minutes. Never came back. I caught him peaking out of the kitchen to see if I was still there. 15 minutes is my limit of being ignored on purpose. They have been super busy lately and only ever seem to have a max of two servers on for a larger restaurant that would have 4-5 at any other business."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 star reviews and I just ate here yesterday and again today.  First, don't expect fine cuisine. I'm not sure when Eric S. ate here, but the vegetables in my fajitas were DEFINITELY NOT frozen. Granted, I got the Fajitas Guadalajara, and it had peppers and onions. Neither were frozen. They still had that crunch and taste from having been fresh before grilling.  This place is an upscale, greasy spoon Mexican place, and it does it extremely well! My fajitas were $14 and I ate 3 huge fajitas in the restaurant and still had enough for 3 more at lunch the next day!  Finally - the guacamole and the flan -- fresh guacamole - has chunks of avocado in it and is made to order. They also use enough lime that it only browns around the edges by the next day. The flan - oh my god... The first time I had it - perfect. So smooth and creamy... Was a spiritual experience.  On top of this all... Freshly fried and still warm corn tortilla chips, and fresh salsa... What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Middleton needs this Mexican joint with enough Mexican beer options to be satiated and other drinks for occasional sampling. The margaritas are okay. I appreciate the bar with television(s?), I've swung by to watch some sporting events. Paint and decor is bright and cheerful, more so than you would think being situated in a strip mall alongside Dollar Tree, a laundromat, and an express gym.  Fajitas Jalisco are genuinely great with chorizo oiling up the other proteins and veggies in the best way possible. Worth the few dollars more than some other entrees. There are always leftovers, and I'm a substantial eater. Bottomless chips and salsa are, at times, served warm. If I'm remembering correctly, there are spicier options for salsa if you ask. Staff do a sufficient job, no complaints in this department. When I think of Cocina Real, I think of a mid-day beer to a game or a Friday night date night, though the crowd is pretty diversified."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Madison area. Great food, decent prices, and very quick service. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem, set back in a strip mall this place has great service and tasty food. Prices are reasonable, portions are large. Chips were really yummy. The food was above average, selection like any small Mexican restaurant. We loved the atmosphere, open space, clean with pleasant Spanish tunes playing in the background. Kid friendly- kid says the fries and chicken strips were tasty. Service was above average, prompt and friendly. I was surprised that this place wasn't busier. I think this may be our new Mexican go to restaurant.  - gave only four stars cause I felt my chimichangas could of been fried a bit longer. Other wise this would of been a 5"}
{"text":"I have a lot of experience with Mexican food having grown up in LA and being an avid cook. In my opinion this food is delicious though not upscale (that's more authentic, really) and the margaritas are 5-star, with many different tequilas available. Very spacious dining room, some cushions on booths need replacing so we picked a table.  A really solid Mexican restaurant and I would say second only to Tacqueria guadalajara (but that one doesn't have margaritas and is small and cramped). Nice place for a family dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who all the one-star complainers are, but we got good food and service very quickly in a clean, inviting establishment.  What else do you cry-baby foodies want?"}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Mexican food.  The regular menu of so many things to choose from and you end up just choosing fajitas-which quite tasty.  The burritos need a bit more of a kick to them, however still wasn't bad.  Chips were not hot fresh but were not straight out of bag.   Monday- Wednesday's they have 2-1 house margaritas....um yum!! Not bad at all for fajitas with room for leftovers, chips and salsa, and 2 margaritas for $25. Speaking of 2 for 1 margaritas, I may have decided to leave my debit card there, oops! I called right away at 10am when the staff starts arriving, they had already set it in a safe place and had the description of what I look like.  So thank you very much! Will return."}
{"text":"Ran in for what I thought would be a \" quick\" carry out order and ended up waiting at the bar for a half hour as 5 men including the manager mindlessly  tried to get my order right ...my friend and I couldn't help but laugh at first ...first they gave me the wrong appetizer and when I tried to explain this to the waiter he told me he was getting the manager..they lost my receipt during this time and there were only two other customers in the restaurant ..I ordered cheese and bean dip, 2 sides of rice 2 sides of salsa and chips were extra because they apparently did not come with either the large salsas or queso dip for a total of $29..I also ordered tortillas on the side 3 different times and ended up without them because somehow they forgot them..the manager shoved the receipt in my face showing me that I indeed I had not ordered tortillas  ...ok ...50cents to carry out the food and the queso dip ended up spilling out into the bag ..the salsa was good but I couldn't help but inspect every bite I took ...not a good experience at all ....tools"}
{"text":"Nice lunch specials, great selection, and nice prices make this a nice choice.  We like our salsa quite spicy, so when we asked for some hot sauce, our waiter brought us some.  It was excellent.  Mixed it into their house salsa and it was divine.    We are both looking forward to going back to try something else on the menu.  A margarita, perhaps.    Margarita specials Monday through Wednesday."}
{"text":"Disappointing... We typically enjoy Mexican food and I was excited for the opportunity to try a new place.   The menu is very similar to most other Mexican restaurants in Madison, the prices were higher. No big deal, if the food is great, that's not a game changer.  The food had cold spots in it, the orders came incorrectly, nobody came to check on us and make sure things were okay. I could understand if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't. That's just not right.  There are enough alternatives in the area, we'll go there instead."}
{"text":"Had some tasty lunch food here - fast too.  I gave the shrimp chimichanga a try.  It had hearty amounts of shrimp and the red sauce was tasty.  I really liked the guacamole.  First time visit so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm always up for finding a new Mexican restaurant to enjoy! Sadly, this one just didn't cut it. I ordered the combo platter (14 I think) and was excited to try their tamale! The waiter informed me that they hadn't made any yet. Okay, it was right around 1pm, they may have run out already with the lunch rush? I look around and the place is relatively slow with plenty of tables open (maybe people don't go there for late lunch).  So, I was able to replace the tamale with a beef chimichanga! When my meal came, I really couldn't pick out which was which (burrito vs. enchilada vs. chimichanga). After a little while, I realized the chimichanga was slightly crispy than the other two. Still, no idea which one was a burrito.  My friend ordered some rice milk (there's a name for it and I'm not about to get that wrong), unfortunately she had to remove an ice cube that had an unidentified black speck on it (gross) - but kudos to her for finishing the drink (I would not have been able to).  Service was pretty quick and we were in and out in 30 minutes for lunch (again, they weren't that busy - but I still like it when I can have a quick meal). I have certainly had better, but unfortunately I have had worse (mostly why I couldn't justify a 1 star rating)."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years and love the margaritas, fajitas, chimichangas... everything is fresh and very good."}
{"text":"My mom is visiting and we came here because the other Mexican restaurants in the area were closed. I am SO glad we went though! The food was delicious, great portions and flavors. While our server appeared to be the only one for the whole restaurant, he did awesome! He literally did not stop moving once. Our drinks were always full and we never had to wait long for anything we requested. I can't wait to come back here with my husband when he isn't working!"}
{"text":"Good food, good selection of Mexican beers, friendly service and reasonably priced.  Big fan of their fajitas!  Their margaritas are favorites of some of my friends.  Not too loud, enough space so it never feels crowded."}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time and I always got the speedy Gonzalez for lunch. I still go here regularly but switch up what I get now. I love the chips and salsa. Home made salsa is some of my favorite in town. The staff is always really friendly and the service is pretty good everything comes out quick and hot. I like the 2-1 margaritas Monday thru Wednesday. On my last visit I got one beef and one cheese enchilada with rich and beans. It's everything I could ask for because I like their red sauce. A lot of places in town just have Verde or mole. Worth checking out! I also like the tacos al pastor and Chile relano. Check this place out for yourself I know I like it!"}
{"text":"This place is a-okay. I was pretty thrilled when they hardly batted an eye at my request for peppers in my lime margarita (it came riddled with fresh-sliced jalapenos: mmmmm!!).  We stopped in for lunch while I was doing time at the laundromat next door. I had a taco salad, which was not the best I've ever had (by far), but the service was EXTREMELY fast, and the staff were attentive, too.  I noticed that they offer a $20 margarita pitcher special, so I'm looking forward to coming back with friends for nachos and drinks. The food I tried wasn't that amazing, but the atmosphere and service warrant another look. I'll report back.  ;)"}
{"text":"Dirty dishes. Dirty silverware. My wife got what she didn't ask for. I could tell the chef was in a rush because the quesadilla was cold inside and cheese wasn't melted. We were the only table in the restaurant and we still didn't get proper service from the chef. The wait staff was great though!"}
{"text":"I ate a late lunch here on a weekday, and the place was pretty dead. That being said, the service was not very quick and there really shouldn't have been a reason for that, so I would be wary to go there for dinner on a weekend. The chips and salsa were yummy and free- one of my favorite parts of any Mexican restaurant! I ordered a salad that was quite large and good, but the dressing that comes on the side came out 5 minutes after the salad. I wish they had something smaller on the menu, like a side salad."}
{"text":"Meh, seems very chainish.  About the same as any other mexican sit down fast food place.  Had the Carne Asada, one measly jalapeno with the dish.  Too much fat on the cuts of meat to be worthy of anything higher than a 3.  Reminds me of El Azteca.  Very watered down americanized feel to the food.  Anyone giving this place 5 stars should have their yelp account deleted."}
{"text":"Cocina Real was accurately described as sorta upscale Mexican. Maybe Mexican diner for Americans... which isn't a bad thing. It's consistently pretty good. We've been coming here for years. Margaritas are decent, the main dishes are suitable for sharing.  In general, they are busy the service can be a bit slow... if they aren't busy, the service is fantastic.   Tonight we split fajitas Guadalajara - pork, chicken, beef. It's decent and plenty big enough for two."}
{"text":"I treated myself to a lunch of Rodeo Tacos. First time here and see they are associated with Laredo's. Overall nice service, perfect timing by the waitress. Chips n salsa come fast to munch on while waiting for the order. I appreciated their mild salsa.   The steak is incredibly seasoned, the beans are supposedly vegetarian and tastes so much better with the side of tomatillo sauce and pico de gallo that comes with the order. But not enuf pico de gallo for my likes!! The tortillas are incredibly greasy but held up. Just don't forget some tums afterwards!! Generous side of sour cream for a dollar extra.  I'm glad I stopped by, first time here, and I'd gladly swing by to order off their lunch menu or bring visiting guests. Hmmmm what to try next!?!?"}
{"text":"I had a terrible date bring me here a while ago. The date was lame but the food was so good! Very authentic mexican food at a great price. I had the cheese enchiladas and it was a huge serving. The wait staff was very friendly. My crummy date must have thought so too since he kept trying to flirt! The waitress didn't respond to him, which was nice. She was either super respectful of the situation or she had her loser-radar fine tuned! :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't as good as I thought it would be. While the house margarita was good and strong like I like them, the tinga tacos I had left a bit to be desired. First, might not be traditional, but I think the  dish would be best served with wheat tortillas instead of corn. Second, the adobo sauce was more spice than taste. Overall, pretty bland for specialty tacos. Sides of rice and beans was good. Though, those are more difficult to turn inedible in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service and quality have really declined in the last year. Cocina Real used to be one of my go-to places, but now it's hit or miss. I used to order the house guacamole to go since the restaurant is on my way home, but the last 3 times the avocados were in large chunks and nothing was mixed together. Mom wanted to go there today for Mother's day because she likes the nachos. We went around 2:00 so the restaurant wasn't busy, but we had to wait a bit to be seated anyway. After waiting what seemed like an unusual long time for a waiter I made the comment to my mom that I thought there was only 1 waiter. The people at two nearby booths confirmed this. Eventually the waiter came over, but he went to the table that was seated after us. Then he took our drink order. When he served the drinks mine was wrong. I stated we were ready to order, but be mumbled something and walked away. When he came back he went again to the table that was seated after us. I want to mention the waiter is the same person who seated us and the other table in the first place, so he knows we were there first. He finally takes our order. When it was served, it was wrong, but not so wrong that we sent it back. I felt bad for the guy because he seemed to be the only waiter which isn't his fault. All in all, the last 4 out of 6 times I've been there I was disappointed. I'm hoping they fix whatever the problem is so I can add them back to my go-to list."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of top mexican restaurants in the Madison/MIddleton area (I've tried a variety in the area and growing up in San Diego, CA, I'd like to think I have a high bar for good mexican food!). The food seems fresh, and has a bit of a kick though not so much that the rest of my family can handle it. The meat in the fajitas and the burritos are moist and tender and the service is attentive. They have a variety of menu items and a kids menu. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you are on a bland food diet, or dislike traditional Mexican spices, well then I have the restaurant for you! Nowhere on Cocina Real's menu does it say hot.  All the sauces are either tomato, mild, or \"creamy\".  I even asked, and my request for spicy resulted in a small container of hot sauce.  Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's not good Mexican food.    We started with the chips and salsa, a delicious cold tomato sauce.  I ordered a carnitas chimichanga, which ended up being half bland pork and green peppers wrapped in a tortilla.  The sides were good, but again, there wasn't any flavor.  For $13, it was a huge disappointment.    Service was good, and the space is nice.  I would go back for more chips, salsa, and hot sauce.  Plus, their dessert and drink menu looked great.  But I would never drop change to eat that food."}
{"text":"Customer service is the worst. We went on Father's Day around 5pm - not terribly busy. We were seated immediately. That is about as good as service we got. After that, the waiter was visibly annoyed that we were not ready to order after 5 min of sitting down. We asked for table side guacamole - never came. Our food came in a timely manner but we could not eat any of it since there was no silverware. Multiple attempts to ask for silverware were ignored and I finally got up and picked up the silverware in my own from the stash - but our food was cold by then. Drinks were delayed but margarita was decent. No water was given despite multiple times asking for water. Waiter never came by to check on us and at the end of the meal, just dropped off the check. We asked for boxes and again were ignored. No one came to pick up the check until another waiter noticed and disappeared with the card for about 10 minutes. We paid and left with no thank you for coming. Of note, the restaurant was about 40-50% full by then.  Overall, food was as expected. Drinks were decent. Service was the worst."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant and the chips and salsa. The burger was good but a little over cooked. When I asked for ketchup I was expecting a dish or a bottle but they came in mini packets instead. I also got lime juice and it was great!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in madison! The staff is always great as well! Would definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"I've read a number of reviews detailing bad service. Tonight, ours was spot on: very attentive, our waitress checked in often and was very friendly (Mayra)  Food was tasty.  Margaritas are 2-fer-1 Mon-Wed. They don't compare to el dorado grill margaritas, but they are delicious and I will order them again."}
