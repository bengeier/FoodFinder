{"text":"Came here with my family for a celebratory dinner. We were greeted and seated by a very friendly young man, who was also our waiter. We decided to start with some bruschetta, which was very yummy. For dinner we had the house red wine (very good and drinkable) and we each had a different entree. All the portions were very generous! My partner had the steak which he said was delicious. I had the amazing chicken parmigiana, would totally get that again as the pasta was el dente and the sauce was just as yummy. The other entrees were the chicken marsala, and the veal scallopini - we ended up taken half of each home as it was a lot of food.
We passed on dessert as we were all too full, but they have a dessert case and they are all baked freshly on premises. 
Will definitely go again, they have a wood oven for pizzas which we all want to try!"}
{"text":"Spacious seating in this venue. Pleasant and efficient service staff. Extensive menu with delicious desserts/pastries. Had the sausage and pepper penne which was very good. My wife had lasagna also very good. Added to our places to go again."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet.  Great deal.  Very friendly service.  She got us fresh items from the kitchen.  The pastry chef is amazing and takes great pride in his work.  I got a whole strudel fresh from the oven for $5.95!"}
{"text":"Went to La Rosa Ristorante in whitby on the NW corner of Garden and Rossland and can't say enough great things about it. I am happy to find this local gem and will be visiting them again soon (especially for the lemon jelly roll OMG)! Family run restaurant where everything is made fresh and authentically Italian! I literally was dreaming last night of the arancini with yummy tomato sauce... It was an interesting layout with the ability to dine in or go to their deli-style service stations so you can stop in and get take out. Our waitress was amazing and so friendly. The food was better than we could have imagined."}
{"text":"My family and I very much enjoy dining here and I would call Rosa's a quality dining establishment. Though I've decided to give Rosa's 5 Stars, because the food is delectable and the staff is friendly, I do also have a few criticisms to lay against it. 

Firstly, the good stuff: The food here is just plain good. That cannot be denied. In particular, the risotto is amazing! The portion sizes are generous, and I really like that I often have leftovers to nibble on once I finish eating here. The chicken is also great! The pasta is often cooked to perfection. 

I would say that the dining staff could use some improvement. I think that it is important to remember that Rosa's is a family establishment, and thus necessitates some leniency in this regard, but oftentimes we will feel neglected by the waiting staff. Additionally, since the staff is close-knit, sometimes the servers are more friendly than they are talented. However, they are all lovely people and we have never been wholly dissatisfied. 

One thing I really like is that your complaints and comments about the food are listened to, and corrections are made attentively and with a smile. That, for me, makes up for the few shortcomings that Rosa's has and solidifies it as a 5 star experience. 

Ps, it's a tad pricey."}
