{"text":"This place is great.  The owner, Curtis is very friendly. Nice laid back pub with freshly made burgers and healthy fresh food options.   I had a salad and it was awesome.  No iceberg  lettuce.  Serves wine from RagApple Lassie supporting a local vinyard.   Old Mecklenburg on tap."}
{"text":"Great food! Also great place to grab some grub if u are near the Charlotte Motor Speedway. All food is fresh and delicious. Would love to see this place get some traction since they haven't been open long but are a gem to find!!!"}
{"text":"After waiting for over a year for this place to open I was excited to go. I wanted to like it, I really did... And perhaps with some edits we will be back...  Oy beer on tap was Old Mecklenburg Brewery (OMB). Need  more options need, much better options... Food was just ok, wanted a burger but they do t have fries... Really? Ordered the BLT that was nothing special.   Fix the beer menu and the food, maybe you will get more folks in."}
{"text":"First off, I was trying to decide between 2 and 3 stars- and chose 3 because our food did taste good but...  We went in on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet.  All the appetizers tasted great- especially the Buffalo Chicken nachos!  Not a huge menu but it worked.  On to the main event. I ordered a ultimate Bacon Burger- which was a patty half the size at any other restaurant and a single piece of bacon cut in half.  :(. My side was the mashed cauliflower and the burger tasted great and fresh, but was seriously the smallest thing I've ever seen, for $10.  Smaller than a kids burger!  Since it was our first visit, not sure if this is the norm.  I liked the actual bar but I'm not paying $10 for half a burger."}
{"text":"Love this place and the food!!  The owner is so friendly and the bartenders are great!! Wasn't sure if I would like wings that are baked but I loved them!!  Pimento cheese flatbread with bacon is one of my favorite appetizer they have!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. And, I believe the place has already closed their doors. The pub is located very near where I live so I was hopping we would enjoy the place. The staff seemed very apathetic. Poor selection of draft beers. Food pricy for what you got. No wonder the place didn't make it..."}
{"text":"Terrible. Food tastes like it's from a can or bottle. Worst chili I've ever had, it tastes like meat paste. We ordered the chili nachos, the chips were cold and the cheese was not melted. Waitress was very rude also, when she asked us \"How is everything?\" we told her the food was terrible. She instantly became offensive and argued with us. How professional lady. We told the waitress when we ordered our nachos that we didn't want onions, when the nachos came they were full of onions, when we complained she showed frustration and jerked the plate off the table.   Terrible food, terrible experience. Terrible waitress. Will never return.   Also, if you hoping to have a side of French Fries with your burger or sandwich think again. They DONT serve fries."}
{"text":"Well, I went there the other day and they changed their menu to boring bar food. They no longer have the tantalizing chicken dishes. They still don't have a fryer, so the menu is very small. They added a picture on the wall that is much too small for the space. Still feels extremely sparse.   Advice : bring back the good menu or get a fryer. Get a decorator and expand your selection of beer/wine."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED. Too bad. I had dinner there a couple of times and I lived the fact that they didn't do anything fried, and all of their food came from local farms. Their creamy coliflower was great, and their mac & cheese was delisious."}
