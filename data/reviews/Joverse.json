{"text":"Great service and exquisite cocktails in a classy setting.  What more is there to say?"}
{"text":"I came to Joverse one evening with my girlfriend while visiting Montreal. Despite the rain, the place was nearly full. The DJ was decent - he didn't take any requests, and played mostly pop music, but it was typical for this type of bar. The bartenders were surprisingly attentive despite how busy it was. The overall ambiance impressed my girlfriend and did not leave us wanting for much. This place is clean, fairly modern, and well suited for a few drinks to begin your evening."}
{"text":"Joverse is a great spot in Old Montreal. The presentation jumps at you as soon as you enter with their DJ playing great evening house music setting up the lounge vibe as you take in the well lit decor -- an intelligent mix of wood and steel arranged against the brick wall background.  The food is fantastic -- all tapas style.  Well priced and quickly served by a very friendly staff with a full evening crowd, which was a very good looking mix.  We were in a group of four and shared about 8 items.  The mushroom plate is delicious! The slider is phenomenal and the beef tartare is great too. Overall presentation, flavour, and service was top shelf.  On top of this, they run an awesome bar downstairs called the Red Room which is big enough for about 50 people and is perfect for a house music filled night right after dinner."}
{"text":"The crab crakes and the tacos were great and the vibe is pretty nice! The crowd and the ambiance is nice, however the music was abit too loud, we went for dinner and we had a hard time hearing each other."}
{"text":"Does not worth the price $ 12 for a 3-ounce margarita and the same price for such a small glass of scotch . It is a pitty to see the barmaid do so careful not to put too much . The food is not bad but...There is much better in Montreal"}
{"text":"J'y étais déjà allée pour un verre quelques semaines après l'ouverture et je n'avais pas été très impressionnée par les 2 plats que j'avais mangé. Les présentations n'étaient pas intéressantes et les saveurs non plus. On dit souvent qu'il faut donner un 6 mois à un restaurant pour faire quelques calibrages de départ. Ça doit être vrai parce que hier (environ 6 mois après l'ouverture), je me suis régalée!!!  La carte des cocktails offrent de bons cocktails créés par des mixologues. Le sake to me est certainement mon coup de coeur dans 5 que j'ai goûtés. On retrouve aussi des classiques, une carte des vins presque entièrement composée d'importations privées (à l'exception des bulles et des rosés) et bien sûr, de la bière.  Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, j'y ai mangé les huîtres, les tacos de canard (un de mes 2 coups de coeur bouffe de la soirée), le mini burger de boeuf et fromage, le mini burger de porc effiloché (2e coup de coeur. On y retrouvait un petit côté sucré, c'était délicieux) et le crab cake et sa mayonnaise épicée. Tout était bien bon! Au point que j'ai regretté d'avoir mangé en après-midi parce que j'Aurais voulu pouvoir goûter 1 ou 2 autres plats.   Pour ce qui est des desserts. la key lime pie sous forme de verrine surmontée de guimauves maison à la noix de coco est très bonne. Il en va de même pour l'étagé de gâteau, de mousse et de copeaux, le tout au chocolat, servi avec truffes et sirop de piment fort qu'il est possible de mélanger (au goût) au gâteau.   C'est l'endroit parfait pour un 5 à 7 entre amis. Surtout que les tables hautes permettent d'être aussi à l'aise debout que assis. Une ambiance branchée et une bonne musique."}
{"text":"I would have to give this restaurant a 3 star only because we had an excellent waitress! The food is really average (Ottawa offers MUCH better restaurants!!) and the drinks were nothing exceptional. I went there for a bachelorette party with 14 guests, ordered the entire menu several times over, and ordered bottle service. Our bill was not cheap! Instead of being welcomed in the restaurant, the snooty manager came to our table 3 TIMES, ordering us to be quiet or she will force us to leave!! Unbelievable! The whole place was loud and there was another bachelorette party, a bachelor party and a bunch of guys watching a hockey game! I even noticed her behaviour around the restaurant where she would walk around like a principle in a school checking on her students doing their homework! The average age of the place is in the 30's so where exactly does she think she is!?The DJ was also extremely snooty and unpleasant, and played the same tunes over and over again, even when the place turned into a \"club\". Honestly, not worth a trip to Montreal and would definitely not come back again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, trendy, chic...but as stated earlier by others: drinks watered down and issues with wait staff. Also, after explaining a food allergy in detail to the waitress multiple times (and calling in advance to explain the allergy), she still brought me both my appetizer and my meal slathered in sauces made of what I am allergic to, which is highly frustrating. Also, no cutlery on the table and not enough napkins. As someone else wrote earlier, the person I spoke to on the phone/manager/maitre'd was very kind and accommodating and told me they take allergies seriously and I believe he tries, but he needs to teach his staff the importance of following through on this and taking it seriously. My waitress was practically yawning and rolling her eyes as I tried to explain this to her... If it weren't for that I'd have given a better review... And, they don't serve tea or coffee, no hot drinks, what Resto doesn't serve tea or coffee with dessert after the end of a meal?"}
{"text":"Was there for my bday and had a blast ! The service was excellent.... after 11:30 they toss the tables so you can dance. The crowd is mostly over 28-29 ehich is great and the music is accordingly. The food was very good too... we had a beef slider and the poutine ! Worth to have a soirée there! ps: way better than Santos !"}
{"text":"Je suis venue au Joverse à plusieurs reprises ; une fois pour le club, une fois pour manger et quelques fois pour les oystermania/tartarefest. Côté club j'ai aimé ; avec les 2 étages, ça fait très spacieux et la musique était bonne. Le crowd est plus vieux par contre que les clubs sur St-Laurent par exemple, plus dans le range du 28 et plus. Côté bouffe, aucune plainte, tous les plats que j'y ai mangé était très bons. La fois la plus récente que j'y ai été c'est octobre 2017 pour l'oystermania et les huîtres étaient superbes ; on était assis à côté du gars qui les ouvraient devant nos yeux - alors elles était super fraîches et bonnes. Mais en temps normal, les prix pour la bouffe sont sur le côté plus dispendieux."}
{"text":"Décor industriel comme je les aime, les toilettes aussi valent le détour ! Sympathique endroit pour le 5@7 entres amis, j'y étais pour l'apéro Vinho Verde :)"}
{"text":"Belle place, mais les prix sont un peu haut etant donnée que le restaurant se trouve dans le vieux port ! J'ai bien aimé le poulet kaarage (je pense qu'on l'ecrit comme ça haha ) mais cest vraiment l'ambiance qui fait la difference!"}
{"text":"I never knew Joverse had a second floor! That looks like every other joint in old montreal. I have been here late nights and was never fond of the crowded lounge scene- the crowd is a mix of old and young. Ladies don't be surprised if you get turned away as a group of girls - it does happen !   I came here for a going away party and finger bites. I had the crab cakes (pretty filling - more like fish sticks then crab cakes) and homemade chips. The menu wasn't that diverse mostly just bar fast food.   Good music though. This is not the place to catch up with friends over conversation-loud and dark !"}
{"text":"This was an excellent bar. We came here after our stop at Ristorante Quattro after our waitress suggested it for drinks. The atmosphere was great here. Dimly lit, but not too dark; a live DJ with music that wasn't overbearing; and a very friendly and attentive group of bartenders who were extremely generous to us.   I tried the Mezcal Tequila at the suggestion of the bartender and wasn't disappointed. Though at $15 a glass I was only going to have one - but it was easily 2.5 shots in my glass. Later on the bartender gave us the leftovers of a shot he had made for another group (using the Mezcal), free of charge.   The place was a great atmosphere and had a great drink selection. I'd highly recommend at least checking this place out for a drink if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The entrance was down a short, dark alley through a door that seemed to lead into the back of the restaurant which was odd. Semi crowded on a Thursday night. We only went because it was a bit later and very cold and this was right down the street from our hotel. Items are overpriced for the amount you get. They're going for a Euro vibe but the food just doesn't match. The oysters were incredibly briny and salty. I tried the soup and it was just okay. I can't even remember what my partner had it was that memorable. Took forever to get our check. We had to ask three different people. It was just okay - there's many other better restaurants in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I'm happy that this place wasn't as bad as last time. I came for drinks just before the fire works it wasn't very packed but lots of bachelorette parties. The waiter we had was 2 weeks new and super friendly. The Service was quick and drinks were good minus the fact that they don't keep their vodka cold huge no no in my eyes.  We asked to have a spot reserved at the bar so we could watch the fireworks and come back and of course they put up a little sign for us so our seats were they once we got back.  They have a oyster bar until 11 pm that actually closed at 10:30. We got PEI pearl ones and they were really good not one bad one in the batch. We would of got more but they closed it down after our first 12.  To get in you would use the street view door, after 11 they put a huge black curtain and you have to come in from the garbage side which I've never seen before, usually they use the side door that leads to the place easy access. When I came out I wasn't sure where I was but eventually figured it out.  All and all it was great service the DJ was alright as well the place gets super cramped and you will be standing unless you buy a bottle."}
{"text":"Un resto du vieu, c'est à dire cher et chic.. Nous y sommes allés pour l'oystermania, les huîtres étaient toutes petites, mais très bonnes et très fraîches. Sinon, le vin est autour de 10-12$ pour un verre, et 12-14 pour les cocktails (taxes incluses). Très bon service, belle déco mais peu d'ambiance Bref, pourquoi pas si dans le coin, mais je ne ferai pas de détour pour y aller.."}
{"text":"Fun place to hung out ppl watching. Service is spotty as place gets busy late at night. Lots of 18 year olds. Drinks are watery. Pregame elsewhere. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"So this place is OK, seems fancy but it's younger than I expected. They make a good martini, and the guacamole plate is quite good? Overall with it! I came here with my wife and her colleague later in the evening (10pm). I guess its a lounge so they were about to morph in to a club lol, there was a lot of security, wonder what sort of crowd they attract?"}
{"text":"Oysters were cheap since we went for happy hour. They were as we were expecting, but the grilled octopus was rubbery. Takeaway was not to go there for food, only drinks. Ambience was hip and full of young urban professionals."}
{"text":"This place is total hipness on 2 floors! If you feel like a funky tavern vibe, then stay upstairs, if you want dancing & intimate schmoozing, hit downstairs. Music is always great, and a cool mix of people. Food is also pretty damn good too. Ask for Julian or Michael if you go."}
{"text":"Very mediocre place.  I was expecting more and I was highly disappointed. I ordered a cosmo for 11$ and it didn't even come in a martini glass it was in a much smaller cup. I then had the crab cakes which barely had any crab meat inside and was mostly just batter. The beer batter shrimp tacos were not battered at all and we're very soggy. Also, normally when you go out for someone's birthday they give a free dessert.  Here they had the nerve to charge me the 6$ churros for my friends birthday. Everything is tapas style and extremely small for the price.  I don't recommend going here if you are on a budget and very hungry.  I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Rude staff. After ordering a Mojito and Perrier water and paying for both, the Perrier water never came. After asking about the water, the bartender said its being brought from the other fridge and to \"calm down\".  I definitely don't need to pay $17 for a Mojito and Perrier water (definitely without tip) to be treated rudely."}
{"text":"The place is decent sized. We went there for my cousin's birthday and were there till 3am until they finally kicked us all out. Stairs to the washroom were a bit of a hassle but the service at the bar was good and the music was great (I lost it when he played Bon Jovi at 3am) Interesting back alley for a quick smoke."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, came from Los Angeles, better then anything I've ever had, food is great and so is the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Quand je suis rentrée, je me suis dit \"Oh boy! Pas sûre que j'vais aimer...\" ; Les gens avaient l'air plus qu'un peu pognés. Mais vite par la fenêtre, cette pensée est allée, Car l'accueil au bar m'a complètement emballé!   Vite, nos commandes passées,  Sitôt nos bulles arrivées ;  Dans le cadre d'une soirée d'huîtres,  il était nécessaire de se dorloter!  Quelques bouchées ont suivi dont des tostados bien épicées,  Et des d'huîtres à la tonne, ont été dégustées.  A suivi du mezcal, gracieuseté du bon chef,  Et de leur bar bien stocké, des cocktails bien concoctés!   Bref, contre toutes attentes, j'y ai été Et une merveilleuse soirée, nous avons passé.  Pas mal certaine qu'au prochain 5@7, sans hésiter,  Ce sera au Joverse que je me retrouverai!"}
{"text":"This is a nice cocktail bar in Old Montreal, and the Sailor Jerry and green tea cocktail is truly delicious. It looks a lot like other bars that have popped up recently with the same vintage raw bulb chandeliers, big wooden tables, metal, warm light, levels and space. It's a nice aesthetic, just feels a little copy paste maybe, but I'd rather we be copying this than other vibes more flourescent and plastic I guess. Higher up on the up side, the staff are nice, and good at what they do, and as my friend who should know pointed out, many look like male strippers. I think that means attractive and clean cut? I dunno. Do with that what you will."}
{"text":"Le Joverse, une nouvelle trouvaille du Vieux Montréal, qui apparemment, a ouvert très récemment ! L'ambiance y est très chaleureuse accompagnée d'un décor industriel chic, stylé et branché ! C'est vraiment un très bel endroit disposant d' un grand bar central et de hauts tabourets en cuir,  avec un mélange de bois et de briques, en parfaite harmonie, faisant en sorte que l' endroit a un certain cachet ! J'aime beaucoup !   Leurs cocktails sont très bons, j ai testé le mojito et l'amaretto sour, ils étaient bien dosés et les prix ne sont pas plus élevés qu' en général !   La musique maintenant ! Il y avait ce soir là un DJ et le son était très bon, ambiance electro, louage, house, et j 'aime ça !   L' endroit est peut être nouveau mais mérite d'être connu ! Si vous voulez boire un verre, discuter et danser, le Joverse est la place qu'il vous faut!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group and everything was great! We were so happy that they were able to accommodate us as our earlier plans changed last minute due to rain.   Their drink menu is a thing of beauty - I loved the sangria with vodka, while the margaritas, although small,  seemed to be a hit with my friends. There's lots of cocktail options and a decent wine list.   Joverse definitely is a tapas-style restaurant, none of the portions are too large, but everything was tasty. We had the guacamole, chips and dip, oysters, arrachera & shrimp tacos. The only complaint I had was that the steak on the tacos was a bit dry, but overall the service was seamless. Our server and the management were attentive and even bought us a round of shooters as we were celebrating a bachelorette.   The atmosphere was very inviting, with dim lighting, lots of wood and a casual, modern mexican feel. Pricing was good, not expensive, but what you'd expect.   It's too bad that we had other plans later on in the evening, as it's supposed to a fun late night spot."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dans le cadre de l'Oystermania! Ils offrent 12 huîtres pour 12$ alors que normalement c'est 36$ ! En plus, ça venait avec un verre d'alcool ! Je n'ai absolument rien à dire contre les huîtres, elles étaient délicieuses !! Les mignonettes aussi!  Par contre, le reste du menu est plutôt ordinaire.. Il y a quelques choix du genre tapas, mais c'est un peu trop cher pour ce que c'est ! du poulet pop corn à 18$ , c'est trop pour moi!   Aussi, le service était lent; peu présent !  Je vous conseille donc d'y aller en formule 5@7 plutôt que d'aller manger ! ET profitez-en lors de l'Oystermania !!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great to just hang and enjoy a good drink. Would recommend. Nice location fun."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night and although the place was gradually picking up, the staff were extremely cordial, and helpful. I tried their burger and their upside down ice cream. I highly recommend both. Interestingly, they serve pop corn with their burger. I thought it be an eclectic choice, but I have to admit, it was great."}
{"text":"Strong cocktail bar with powerful cocktail drinks, these wonderful juleps still make me smile now in the morning. The other magic word is tacos, deliciously balanced combinations of multiple fresh ingredients, make sure to use the sauce from your serving board while eating the tacos, it matches perfectly the food. The guacamole was also nice, but not exceptional.   Another sign of quality is the service, very professional, may be one the best I have seen in Montreal.  Joverse has nice terrace for the summer days and once you need to migrate inside there are two floors with bars, where you can continue sipping your drink. As the terrace is closed the front door gets peculiarly locked with huge chain and blocked with piece of wood,  dark curtains fall over the windows and the bar suddenly gets this wonderful dimly lit athmospere. The very personal approach in the bathroom wins another smile.  Must try!"}
{"text":"I am torn and let me explain why. I came here for a party. The person I dealt with through email was extremely nice. Friendly, on the ball, gave me all the information I needed. I have no complaints there. The place itself is a small place, super cute. Now the problem lies in the staff. I'm not sure if our waiters were new but there seemed to be a lot of confusion when it came to ordering drinks. They had ran out of most of the white wine. They mixed up our drinks on numerous occasions and the drinks themselves were extremely watered down. That's where the disappointment comes in. The drinks were not cheap at all. But for the price that you paid, I wanted to taste something other than water and olive juice. The food itself was good. I wouldn't say anything more than good. For the cost, I was expecting something more to be honest with you. Given the opportunity, I would have preferred going back to La Champagnerie. It costs the same but the drinks will knock your socks off and the food portions and taste is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"My sister (who's in her early twenties) was visiting, and her friends insisted they go here. I wanted to see her so I went along with my wife at around 11pm for drinks etc.  Totally not my vibe of a place. Loud bad remixes of songs and eurotrashy decor, gold digger girls and international students with too much of Dad's money to piss away in some kind of weird Diesel commercial themed egofest.   But the drinks were good and strong (though a tad pricey), and service generally nice for this kind of place.   Some people would like this, but I'll never for the life of me understand what the attraction is to these kinds of places. Though it may be different if you go earlier for food more etc, not sure."}
{"text":"This is a very cool bar with nice staff and ambiance.  Great wine selection, private importations by the glass.  Acadian salad, beef sliders, duck tacos and guacamole were good, nothing really special though, usual comfort food. Salad had a delicious dressing with fresh and crispy veggies (tomatoes, carrots, etc.), but beets were way too sour! Meat in beef sliders was tender, juicy and tasty. Simple but dope! Duck tacos (2) were too small but filled up with yummy ingredients. A bit of lime lacked in the guacamole mix.   Milk chocolate jar was awesome, except the homemade coconut sorbet was a bit too hard on the tooth. Layers of chocolate cream, crumbles, raspberry jelly. Good flavors and textures.    Overall service was fast and the staff very friendly. Food was good, but overpriced.   I'd return there, but only for drinks."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY Joverse?? SERIOUSLY? Really? I gave Joverse another try last night despite my last experience being really unimpressive. Guess what? IT WAS WORSE. This time we didn't even get a drink order in. There was no one in the place. Not one patron besides us. My friend and I sit down, no one comes to see us. I walk to the bar and ask for menus. Despite being the only patron in the bar, I wasn't greeted. The bartender stood there looking at me like I just walked into the place with no pants on. I assure you, I had pants on. I asked him for a menu, he said he'd bring us some. I go to use the restroom (which was an absolute horror show by the way - there is no excuse for your toilets to be filthy at 5pm other than your disgusting, slovenly practice or lack thereof in cleaning them - and I am talking backed up toilettes covered in excrement and urine - empty soap dispensers - dirty floors) and by the time I came back my friend had 1 menu but whatever, we can share. We sat and waited. And sat. And waited. And sat. Then left. Forget you guys."}
{"text":"I came here organizing a private dinner for a bachelor party from Chicago. Manny was extremely attentive and responsive during the process. The 8 course menu option as small plates was great and I thought a good value for a major city. Additionally, we had 17 people drinking for ~3 hours and again I thought our bill was fair. The food was passed small plates and a stand up dinner. Great way to go for our situation. Also, the service was fantastic so no idea what others are talking about. The music and vibe was hip but not over the top. My only regret is that we didn't stay for longer upstairs in the main room once we were done for my event. It was a highlight of our trip.  The overall reviews don't do this place justice. Please sift through all of the reviews mentioning that the restaurant didn't serve them water from spring fed glacial run off or they wouldn't let their dog from their purse in."}
{"text":"They left a jug of water on the table! We came as a group. If you are more than 10 people they will take your credit card to hold the reservation.  The place is pretty loud. It's a happening party spot. Great atmosphere. Lots of birthday groups and bachelorette groups.  I got the fish tacos. It's really delicious. I tried my friend's tartar d'hanachi and it was also a great option. But the food are tapas sized portions so as long as you come not too hungry. The Coconut Cream drink is really good and not creamy.  The service was good. They are a little quick to clean up after you and pick up your drinks and plate even before you're done.  After it turns into a club with amazing music and dancing!"}
