{"text":"Worst Chinese I've ever had. Vegetable fried rice was extremely oily with no flavor. Hardly any Chicken in the Cashew Chicken. Egg roll was mushy and again no flavor.  Orange chicken had a bitter aftertaste. Had order delivered and they forgot an order of rice."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting family in Madison, I ordered my usual salad rolls and beef pho soup.  The pork/veggie salad rolls were good, I was kind of surprised to see that some scrambled egg was included in it and found it a nice addition.  Instead of the usual peanut sauce, it came with a sweet and tangy sauce that I think had some fish sauce in it and was quite good.  My pho soup was the beef steak and meatball version and although I didn't order it, it included some tripe as well.  I don't eat tripe but that's okay, just picked it out.  Overall the soup was very tasty with a generous portion of noodles and meet.  I never would have noticed this place but my cousin lives right near State St. and has been here before, the atmosphere leaves a little to be desired but the food is great and very well priced.  I would definitely recommend it for good Thai or Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"Wow! Very impressed with this Asian delivery. Food was fresh and promptly delivered. Veggies were cooked perfectly and the entire family enjoyed. A definite upgrade from the Asian delivery in my former neighborhood."}
{"text":"I think this \"hidden gem\" is the best Thai place in Madison. I love divey looking places, especially when seeking ethnic food. That hopefully tells me they care more about the food than the decor. This place matched that. We walked in on a cold day and saw mostly Asian people eating -- another good sign. Ordered different stuff and all was excellent and very authentic tasting. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"Delicious hibachi!  For those times when you're not in the mood to sit and watch them cook it :)

The place itself is nothing fancy but I usually do take out anyways."}
{"text":"I just moved from California and my neighbor told me to eat at Asian One. So I called for delivery last night and I ordered the Sesame Chicken, Chicken lomein and Crab Ragoon. The food got over to my house quick and the food was delicious, we really liked it. The Sesame Chicken was crispy and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is really good for something fast and to go.  My husband and I both get the hibachi steak and it's delish!  I will say it's a bit overpriced for it being a to go restaurant, but still very good food.  The family who owns and works there are so nice!"}
{"text":"When I first saw the building from the outside, the place looked small and shady. But once you go inside, it's actually quiet nice and roomy. The service was good and the food was definitely worth the price that we paid. 

We had chicken wings and the spicy sausage as an appetizer. The chicken wing was kind of bland and blah, but the sausage was definitely worth trying. I don't know if i would pay $5 for few pieces of meat again. We also had the papaya salad and sticky rice. Both of them were very good and very original taste...spicy and fishey!

Our main dish, we ordered pad Thai, Drunken noodle and Pho. Don't order the Pad Thai! It had a very vinegary taste, and okay consistency. Drunken noodle was very tasteful and worth a try as well. Pho was okay as well. The broth was tasty, ample amount of noodles, but not enough meat. 

Overall, don't let the outside appearance fool your expectations. Definitely worth a try! ^_^"}
{"text":"Asian One has the best Thai, Southest Asian food in Madison. The food is delicious, reasonably priced, and the staff are all great. The restaurant is roomy and the staff come to our table to chat.  Asian One is our go to restaurant for all sorts of family occasions. 

I think the previous review by Rebecah has to do with her world view. I think she is use to the Stir Fry 88 in the West Town Food court. I normally don't respond to other reviewers. Quite frankly she appears to be a liar."}
{"text":"Love this place! Need hot food quick? Boom!!!! Every time I've ordered it's ready before I can get there ( which is very close ). Always hot as hell and less than 6 bucks with a daaaaamn drink!!! You can't eat this good for that cheap anywhere in Ballantyne. Chicken always is tasty and fresh. I love the garlic chicken and sesame chicken is on point too, but if you're an idiot and are expecting this place to remind you of actually eating on the streets of China then move on. This is great food at a more than reasonable price and fast service, not Hibachi Grill where they bring out a non-asian to cook in front of you and do magic duck fireball tricks. This place does what it implies and very well at that!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Asian One right after they opened and found their Kung Pao chicken to be rather disgusting. Reading the review of the hibachi steak, I figured I'd give it one more go for lunch.

I ordered hibachi chicken for carryout, and waited and watched while they prepared it and seemed to prepare a bunch of other items too, which must have been for other carryout orders since the other 5 people dining in were eating.

Asian One has a completely open kitchen, which I sure hope doesn't bite them someday. I had a few concerns while watching them. Most notably someone grabbed a raw chicken breast from a bucket to put in the skillet, and then without washing their hands grabbed some raw vegetables and the tongs to cook with the chicken. No clue if this is a major hazard or not, but it's probably something I'd do at home and I figured everything going into that skillet was cooked within an inch of its life. Still, I'd think they might treat raw chicken like the nuclear biohazardous waste Food TV seems to think it is, in a totally open kitchen. (In all fairness, I'm sure none of us wants to see what happens in the CLOSED kitchens.)

Brought the food home, and meh - it was okay. It was Tintin-like (the Uptown restaurant, for those who don't know it) in quality and taste, even including the weird creamy sauce I have gotten before at Tintin. I hate that mushrooms are pre-chopped to very small pieces in the vegetable mix so it's impossible to remove them. It was a $10 lunch, which is on the high side for what you get.

Asian One is okay, but it's just not to my liking. My husband wants to try it so I'm sure we'll be back at some point, but really only for him."}
{"text":"The food is decent from here.  We ordered le mein, egg rolls,  and orange chicken.  They gave a lot of food and it tasted pretty good.  The prices are fine and the people were friendly.  We got take out, so I can't speak for how the service is if you eat there."}
{"text":"The best general tso chicken and chicken fried rice I've had since I've been in Charlotte! Trust me, I'm from up North where Chinese places actually TRY, so I know good Chinese when I taste it. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for years the owners and staff are so friendly and the food is consistently great. There was miscommunication between my dad and I when he was placing an order for me to pickup on my way home and I reminded him of my sesame seed allergy, which he forgot to put in the special instructions when placing the order online, so of course, there were sesame seeds in my shrimp hibachi. I called the store and explained what happened and the owner was very understanding, they remade the shrimp and vegetables and when I picked it up everyone was super friendly about it, I made sure to tip extra for the trouble and was on my way. The shrimp hibachi is absolutely amazing, as well as the beef teriyaki skewers but they're so good that they sell out of those pretty quickly. Very polite owners, and great food. They do a great job."}
{"text":"We have ordered (delivery) 3 or 4 times now and every time the food is very good, delivery is prompt, the delivery driver always has a smile and is friendly...guess this is why we have a shortcut to be able to make an order...
When moving to a new place like we did a couple months ago, it's hard to find a Chinese restaurant that not only delivers but has good food, prompt delivery and isn't outrageously priced...so glad we found them...:-)"}
{"text":"Just to get to it....

White rice was like Comet rice from the Harris Teeter across the parking lot. It was rather hard and tasteless. Fried rice was a greasy, brown version of the same.

Sesame chicken was like a 1.4 on a scare of 1-5.

Broccoli was wilted. 

Hibachi veggies had no taste and seemed to have a lot of liquid in them for being hibachi.

I did appreciate the tails being completely removed from my rather tasteless shrimp.

Scallion pancakes must have been cooked a few days ago and microwaved today. They were SO TOUGH. The dipping sauce was good, though. I imagine it came from a factory where quality control is somewhat more important. There were a lot of them, though. So, that was something.

Egg rolls were a hot mess. I forgot about that until I was crying over the ton of money I wasted on my lunch today. A coworker reminded me because I gave her one of my extras last time. She hated it. She reminded me not to order from Asian One again. Then she dried my tears. 

I'm sure it could have been worse...somehow, soooo, there's one star for that. The other one is because they're relatively cordial."}
{"text":"The food is good and most the time pretty fast and hot. The teriyaki beefs sticks are amazing you get two and they are so tasty"}
{"text":"Ok, I still think the prices are slightly high for the dinner combos but only slightly.  So why am I upgrading this place to four stars?  Because on a hot summer day while the wife was at work, my car started spewing antifreeze so I had to let it chill.  I hadn't gone grocery shopping lately so there wasn't much to eat in the house.  The only non-chain pizza place that delivers to our house is terrible, so I decide Chinese would be good.  I call this place to make sure they deliver here and they said they do but it may take a little longer.  They're in Charlotte; I'm in Fort Mill 3 counties, 2 states, and 3 townships away (but still only about 5-6 miles).  I called back a few minutes later, placed my order, and it was at the door 25 minutes later fresh and hot!  The fried rice was actually very good and the moo goo gai pain was again decent, although just a little more chicken would have been nice.  Still, for not having to cook or clean up dishes on a hot summer day, this was definitely good."}
{"text":"As far as fast food asian cuisine is concerned, Asian One seems to have their act together.  
I recently called an order in during my lunch break.   The lady on the phone was quick, and to the point while taking the order.  When I picked up my food, they had the food cooked, and only had to box everything up for me.  
I ordered the General Tso chicken with steamed brown rice and an egg roll.  I personally was not impressed with the egg roll, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  The chicken was very tasty though, and the broccoli and green peppers (I believe they were green bell peppers to be exact- maybe its just me, but I missed the little red thai peppers) were very fresh.  The portion size was also very nice considering the low price point for the lunch specials. 
Will I be back?  Yeah, its extremely convenient to where I work, and they were very fast and they deliver!"}
{"text":"The smell of grease pervades this place and stuck to me for hours after I left.
I love spring rolls.  They are are supposed to be light and fresh and full of nice crisp veggies, the spring rolls are Asian One are like sticky logs of blandness.  The Angel chicken wings are one of the most pointless and hardest to eat foods that I have ever come across.  It is a chicken wing stuffed with pork and veggies and it was greasy and bland.
Those were the only things I tried, they may have good dishes there, but after trying two and being dissappointed by both of them, I will not return."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight--if you don't like Asian One's food, something is wrong with you. Maybe your palate sucks. Maybe you've never had legit Thai/Hmong food. Maybe you can't tolerate anything spicy.

This is, by far, the most authentic restaurant in Madison (besides a few Mexican places). Superb curries and excellent mango salad.

The Mussaman Curry here is exemplary and an excellent example of how a good curry should be. Just spicy enough and accompanied by hints of peanuts and sweet coconut milk. It's outstanding. Oh, it's also $7. It's a bargain, and the best in Madison, by a mile.

Look past the restaurant's dumpiness and slightly dirty interior. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood . Ordered takeout .  Hot and sour soup  was average . lacked dimension.  spicy Chicken was not so spicy.  Egg roll was not hand made.   Disappointing for my first visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant. Delicious curry and spring rolls"}
{"text":"This is our first Chinese restaurant we visited since moving to NC - the quality of the food is comparable to the best \"sit down\" restaurants back in PA."}
{"text":"Not sure how this is the first one star review of this place... but here goes.

Driving home today, I wanted something QSRish, but without a drive thru since my three year old would have insisted on getting french fries. Since Wednesday is not Fry-day, except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free, I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.

So, I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place, but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.

First off, this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place, so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because, how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.

The egg roll was among, if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.

Then came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was, it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.

Seriously, if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian, skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay versus getting food at Asian 1."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat and it can easily be overlooked because of its decrepit and shady outward appearance.  I love the atmosphere and design inside, service was fast, and the dishes were delicious.  Great curry, spring rolls, and THE BEST fish dishes.  Be sure to ask for the fish dish with the entire, untouched fish.  It might be a hassle to peel the scales and pick the bones out, but it was excellent.  One of the best dishes I've had while living in Madison."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and sorry to say, was less than average.

Had the egg drop soup, always my go to and there was absolutely no flavor, even with the crappy noodles.

Ordered the Mongolian Beef dinner, which is actually the combo. The meat was not tender like it should be and again, tasteless.

My daughter order the lo men and said it was just average.

I noticed the portions was less then you would get normally which would have been fine if the food was decent.

I will not be going back. I'll stick with China Express in Pineville"}
{"text":"Tried three times before posting a review. Thought any place could have a bad day the first time, second time slightly better food and yesterday was my last visit. Each time I ate in so food was freshly cooked but like others have said it is always oily, lacks flavor and very little meet in the meals. Egg rolls are always just a blob of dripping oil with no taste. Service is the worse part, they act like they don't care if you are there or not. No thank you, no how was your meal, even though it is primarily a take place you would think if someone was eating in they would walk your order over to your table but nope just yell out and then sit down behind the counter. By the way no tea and 2 out of 3 visits the fountain drink machine was out but instead of offering to fix I just had to select something else."}
{"text":"Food was ok- Portions average~ Soups were bland and not thin~ No noodles for 3 soups~ Expensive for mediocre food. Sesame beef was good but more broccoli than necessary, and scallion pancakes were worst I've had bland and just bad. Very little flavor."}
{"text":"The food was awful!!!
I know this is no place for vegetarians, but this is beyond ridiculous. We went there for the 1st time for a quick bite, and ordered 
Vegetable dumplings, coconut fried rice and Singapore style thin noodles.

The coconut fried rice was rice in brown sauce, with sheredded coconut on top. And it tasted horrible.

The noodles are by the the worst. 

I don't understand how his place has survived for 5 long years."}
{"text":"Finally found a Chinese restaurant on the south side of town.  Compared to several other places I've tried, this place is pretty decent.  I had the honey chicken which was very yummy. I also had an order of vegetable lo mein, which was just okay.  And I wasnt a fan of their spring rolls.  Overall, the food was good.  And I would certainly recommend it.  It just wasnt the best chinese food."}
{"text":"Not much different than your typical Chinese-American take out place.  One exception is that they offer hibachi style meals!

I've had their steak hibachi and shrimp hibachi and they are both pretty decent for not being cooked right in front of you!  The veggies seem fresh and not over cooked and they give you a good helping of shrimp sauce to pour over everything (well, I like to pour it over everything)!  

We've also had their Chinese dishes and they are pretty decent too!  Crab Rangoon is excellent and I prefer the form they use (or order because I'm sure it's not made from scratch at the restaurant) which is the triangle shaped pods.  Other places use the \"purse form\" and those aren't as easy to eat than the pods!  Cashew chicken is good and sweet and sour chicken is good too!

The food is always steaming hot when I get home and I live about 10 minutes away!

Asian One has turned into our go-to Chinese take out place so I hope it's here to stay!"}
{"text":"Asian One is consistently superb. I order delivery about twice weekly. The food arrives promptly hot and delicious . I keep a carton of Hot & Sour Soup on hand for a quick fix. I want hot and spicy an they literally deliver."}
{"text":"The food is actually good here.  My son loves the fried pork wontons and my husband swears by the Hunan.  But the customer service can use some work.  We usually get delivery, and 2 out of 5 times they forget something in our order.  And then they make us wait to get it.  Which I think is wrong because why is it that they don't double check these orders to make sure that it's in there?"}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times.  Love this place.  Consistently good take home chinese.  People are great.  Service is wonderful.  Don't forget to grab your sauces when you pick up and go though.  Singapore rice noodle (mei fun) is good.  Do recommend you get your orange chicken sauce on the side so chicken is still crispy when you get home."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese Restaurant. They are very quick and make some good food."}
