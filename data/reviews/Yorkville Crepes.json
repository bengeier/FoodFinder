{"text":"It's a cute place.
But frankly the crepes are only ok... (There are better ones...much better ones)
The waitress was really nice though!"}
{"text":"I had the Paris x, which is banana, chocolate and ice cream.  The place it self is very clean and charming. They have interesting art work. The staff is fast."}
{"text":"The place is Tiny, Cramped, and Hot. So why is it so great?

This place has the best crepes in Toronto. The staff is super nice. And I feel like I transported to Paris by simply walking in the door. I'm headed back RIGHT NOW!!"}
{"text":"Usually I'm not a big fan of sweet stuff. But the Crepes they serve are really good. Nice french touch..."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, and the feeling of Paris without the rudeness or dirtiness.  What else can one ask for?  

I have been twice to this establishment.  The first time we stumbled upon the restaurant after a walk through Yorkville.  I ordered a Diminique Crepe - brie, tomato, onion and basil.  Ultra delicious with the brie oozing out at the bottom over my hand, which I promptly licked off.  My partner ordered the Parisienne (with smoked salmon, dill and some other stuff), also delicious.  We tried the their house lemon drink, which I was not too fond of - I think it is an acquired taste.  We left satisfied and wanting more.  

The second time I visited Crepes a Gogo was this last weekend.  My partner and I had talked about going back after the last experience and decided to pick this weekend for a trip.  I ordered the Italienne crepe with tomato, cheese, basil and sliced egg.  My partner ordered the Cote D'Zur with goat cheese, basil, tomato and I believe scrambled egg.  The crepes were yet again delicious, although I thought my Italienne was a little under-seasoned.  We also ordered a bottle of apple cider, which to our pleasant surprise was the sparkling version.  We downed it quickly with our meal.  

The only downside of Crepes a Gogo is its small size.  It can get very busy and finding a seat at the table can be difficult.  Both times, we were seated at the window bar on tall stools.  It wasn't bad, but not as comfortable as the tables.  Both times, hoards of people walked in after us and stood around waiting for a seat.  You might want to check out this place earlier rather than later on a weekend.  

Service can also be a bit slow and disorganized.  Some of it is owing to the fact that there is only one person making the crepes over two stoves.  Each crepe is painstakingly crafted, making it difficult to meet the volume of people who descend into the restaurant for sit in or take out.

Probably the best crepes in the city.  I would go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but my 3rd time here is sadly the last.  The crepes were good minus the small size.  I could ignore the small seating area and small size crepes BUT I can't ignore the terrible customer service, it is very bad!  The service is slow and they are rude.  On my last visit, one staff told me it would take 15 minutes to make my crepe.  After 15 minutes, I asked about my order and another staff informed me it would take another 20 minutes.  What the hell? It was 12noon on a Saturday, there was just 2 couples who were already served!  How long does it take to make one order of cheese and mushroom crepe for take out?   After being told to wait again, I told them no thank you, turned and walked out.  Unbelievable! That was my last time wasting my time there.  So sick of their bad customer service.  It's sad to read other negative but true reviews about this place, they lost a lot of good customers and future ones too.  There are other crepes places in T.O to enjoy & where they respect you and welcome you!"}
{"text":"Went here to grab lunch as all my usual fast food places seemed to have been closed. I should have known by the fact that this place was deserted at lunch hour that it was not a good choice. This places looks uncared for and dirty, the staff is rude and dismissive and the crepes are very overpriced for what you get. Save your time and money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Food was delicious and different, small shop makes it feel really homely! Love the French flair!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot for crepes! The place is pretty tiny, so I wouldn't go with a large group. Best to go with just one other person, and I wouldn't recommend getting them to go unless you're eating them immediately (they're definitely best fresh!).

I highly recommend the Parisienne (savoury crepe) - with scrambled eggs, swiss, mushrooms, threads of red onion and dill ($8.50). This is definitely their most popular crepe, and rightfully so.

They bring the crepes to you wrapped in brown paper bag. After placing them in your hands, they rip the paper bag for you so you can get right into it. It's just such a cute little spot!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since the new owners took over the Crepes a GoGo location on Yorkville so a friend and I thought we'd check it out. All I can say is....YIKES. The new owner and her staff (I think they're her two daughters but could be mistaken) clearly have limited experience in running a restaurant and need to realize that one's reputation and credibility aren't ever based on what the PREVIOUS owner did. To start, the owner sat outside for the first 30mintues with a small very yappy  dog that barked non stop....while the door was wide open and while the 2 staff were clearly struggling to stay on top of the orders. Ours finally came after about 25 minutes (2 basic crepes) and were wrapped in paper and one napkin (with no others on the table). We asked for plates to which the server informed us she didn't think there were any available - even though there were several in plain site on the shelf behind the counter,  but that she'd check...which she didn't do. Despite asking for water, none came. Really, not much went right with this meal. I hope the new owner soon realizes that asking for  plates shouldn't be perceived as an inconcience, that some people don't want their crepes wrapped in paper and shoved in their faces while the sever says she'll rip the paper (offering no options but for her to do that and then shoving the crepe in my hand) and that the severs' attitude towards the customers should probably be one where they're glad that you're  there trying the place out. Really not welcoming in the least and really don't think I'll be going back, which is a shame."}
{"text":"Crispy crepes that don't taste like eggy rubber! Very impressed by how filling the crepes are and TomTom is definitely a favourite (love smoked salmon). 

As others have already mentioned, their signature drink Lemonana is the perfect balance of lemon and mint, not too sweet, bitter, or sour. The mint isn't overwhelming either, so it's all very refreshing."}
{"text":"How can you like crepe made from pre-mix powder and water.....not real crepes and salty crepes are not called crepes but galette bretonne....."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. One yum for the Crepes, one yum for the location and the third for the cute French-Canadian guys who take your order :-)"}
{"text":"The best crepe place in town!  they have a lot of choices, but when it comes to crepe, and when I'm just having it as a snack, I always order the cinnamon sugar! very simple, plain, just the way it sound! a nice light snack. 

I also like their lemonade tea LIMONANA a lot!!! I ordered take out that day and was going to eat it while I walk back to my car, I wanted to try their drink but I have no hands for a cup if i'm eating and given that I have a few shopping bags already. It was a chilly evening, around 0 degrees... the owner suggested to have the drink warm and she offered to heat up the drink for me and put it back into the glass bottle so I can carry it in my bag for a little while and drink it in the car when I'm driving home. 

I have to say the LIMONANA is a bit pricey, about $3 a bottle, compare to a gatorade or any pop is only about $2. But if you see it as an alternative to a Starbucks frappuccino, this is reasonable."}
{"text":"Crepes a GoGo's plain cheese Crepes are fabulous and the Nutella ones are just a great i like it for a day when you feel like French food but you live in Toronto Limonana is a bit boring but is apparently very great according to friends( I'm a fan of their bottled Orangina though!)"}
{"text":"Staff are completely incompetent and unprofessional.  Will not let you bring Starbucks or any name brand drink into the restaurant, even if you are taking your crepes to \"go go\".  

Food is good, but seriously - who wants to actually give their business to such unpleasant jerks...the owner of this place is ridiculously annoying.  They shout at each other in french and they will talk about you in french as if half of Canada doesn't actually speak the language.

There's also no A/C in this place, probably because they have a hard enough time actually paying their rent to operate in Yorkville with such shotty business practices.

There's better crepe places in Toronto, I suggest taking your business to anywhere except Crepe a GoGo."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for the Saint Tropez crepe. The crepes are authentic and pretty good, but the rude staff and slow service ruined the experience for me. Finally I stopped going."}
{"text":"First off I can't believe that anyone would eat at this place. I'm shocked at some of the reviews about this place.  I guess most people here have never been to  Montreal or Paris.  You can't even call these things that they served me crepes. I was flabbergasted at what they served me.  I have had better breakfast at McDonalds than a place like this. I myself make better crepes than what was served to me. It is one of the worst places I ever had breakfast at.  If you even call it that.  The place is so tiny and not very welcoming at all.  I ran into this place because I was craving crepes. So I went in and thought that they would make great crepes. Wrong.  They are the worst crepes I ever ate.

First off the women who gave me the menu wasn't very friendly at all.  Then I sit down and have coffee and it was cold and the cup on the outside was dirty. It was disgusting.  I ordered crepes and they tell me if I want them crunchy.  Who the hell eats crunchy crepes?  I told her I don't want them crunchy.  So the women then brings me crepes not on a plate but on some metal gadget.  It must have been something she found or got a Value Village.  I never in life seen crepes served that way. Not only was it given to me on a metal plate but it was wrapped in paper.  I thought I was been served a FALAFEL instead of a crepe.  The crepe was thick and chewy and hardly any filling at all.  Just a few strawberries and some other thing inside.  I was charged almost $13 for a disgusting cup of coffee and so called crepes. 

What a rip off this place is.  I would never ever recommend this place to anyone.  Nor would I ever go back there and eat at this place again.  So people save your money and go elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"The crepes are quite good but the service is slow for a small place (seats less than 15). It took over 2 hours for my wife and I to get 4 crepes and 2 hot chocolates. Take out is much faster in the evenings.

The biggest problem we faced was the owner constantly chastising her coworkers (quite loudly) in front of customers."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today and it only took me 15 seconds to realize everything I had read about Veronique, the owner of this place, was true. In front if me she humiliated and yelled at her employee because the crepe she made wasn't beautiful enough. Original version: \"look at this, is this beautiful?? Is this beautiful?? It doesn't look good. How many times do I have to show you?? I'm so tired of explaining again and again, I'm really loosing my patience\". And the poor girl to say \"désolée\", to please her, in French. 
I was so shocked, I decided to cancel my order and told the owner her reputation was worse than what I could have imagined, that she treated her staff very badly and that she should be ashamed of it. She started yelling at me \"ok ok goodbye goodbye, merci merci\". 
I am French and I miss eating crepes A LOT. But I'd rather keep craving them than supporting this awful woman. Please, don't go there and don't support such a bully. Please please. Merci."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast, as it was rather close to our hotel. I had La Canadienne, a crepe filled with eggs, brie, bacon, and maple syrup. The consistency of the crepe was especially good, as it was nice and hot. They weren't shy with the portions either. They have a lot of sweet crepe options as well, that looked equally as good. Overall great food!"}
{"text":"I've moved out of Toronto for a couple of years now, but I still can't stop thinking how good this one little Crêpes place was, and nothing seems to compare out west.  The buttery goodness of the crêpes and the french quaintness of the store, oh how i missed you lil'crêpes store!

Best Spinach / Cheese / Egg Crêpes in town!"}
{"text":"I stopped by during the heat wave in order to cool down and enjoy something to take my mind off the near-death outside. I asked for a recommendation and the waiter chose the Tartinade, a hazelnut/chocolate spread. I am glad I asked for the recommendation since Tartinade had a cloying sweet flavour with none of the sort of heaviness I associate with chocolate in general. I am told the savoury varieties make for decent light meals but I can't speak to that yet. The crepes are served in a wrapper so as to make it a convenient take-away treat. 

While many other reviewers have pointed out it is a French creperie, you do not need to speak French to be served well. (This may be an undeserved assumption here but there is a fear of this nonetheless.)"}
{"text":"The Yorkville location will have new owners very soon; not to fear, the wonderful original owner is training the new owners on her famous crepe recipe and technique. 

I am relieved that she plans to keep her Limonana beverage business.  The minty, lemony drink is a fave of mine now whether served hot or cold.  I hope the new owners will still carry it."}
{"text":"This quaint little creperie in the corners of Yorkville is a sliver of \"Paris\"-dise and I was so pleased to have my co-worker Bernice suggest that we stop in and now I can't wait to go back for more. Inside this french bistro - there was a quote on the wall that just resonated with me \"Il faut manger pour vivre, non vivre pour manger\".  It's a famous quote by Moliere which means that one should eat to live, not live to eat and this seems to be my motto - the pleasure and sensations I get from my culninary experiences give me my gusto and my joie de vivre!   Crepes a GoGo .. you've captured my heart!

I had the \"Tartinade\" - which is a piping hot crepe made with their home made nutella! It came in a brown paper bag and was just delicieux!!  The nutella was not too sweet, it was just the right flavour and I had them add bananas to the crepe ... it was really perfection!
Another highlight was our drink - their house made Limonana.  It was simply amazing and so refreshing especially on a hot summer day!  It the perfect blend of lemonade and mint and can be served hot or cold. 
The owner Veronique makes and bottles this thirst quenching beverage on the premises and now it's available in places like St. Lawerence Market and Pusateris.  I am craving some Limonana now, I can't say enough about this drink as it's so good! MMMmmm!  As the owner declares \"when life throws you lemons, add some mint... and drink limonana!\""}
{"text":"I literally signed up for Yelp to express my disgust for this business. Worst experience ever. The owner and her staff both have bad attitude, bad customer service and bad work ethics. She'll make you wait until she's done with her über eats orders so don't go there unless you have lots of time to waste. Their prices have also went up from the previous owner. This is not the original authentic crepes a gogo so I will not return to this place and I swear by it."}
{"text":"I went to Crepes a GoGo years ago when it was at its old location on Bedford and tonight I made the mistake of going there for an evening with a couple of girlfriends.  I have been to many restaurants and it has been a long time since I have had service that was this bad.  The situation was actually so bizarre that I cannot help but laugh as I write this.

Beware of unadvertised extra charges!  We split two crepes among three people and when we asked for cutlery our server told us that there would be a $1 charge and that she could not cut the crepe for us.  It was a bizarre way to start the meal, but it was $1 so we went along with it.  Now, let me remind you that we were three people so when she only returned with one set of cutlery, we were a bit confused but asked for another set.  The crepes were fairly good (I would have given three stars), but the service was a major negative.

When the bill came and we inquired about the $3 \"miscellaneous\" charge, the owner came over to our table and that's when things became interesting.  Apparently, she likes to yell.  After listening to her go on about \"the service industry\", how her \"bills are tight\" and how \"if other people saw us sharing, they would all want to share\", I could not help but wonder what on earth had happened to this quaint little creperie.  Judging by the scared looking employees behind the counter, things have been rough since they changed locations.  Hmm....  Maybe Yorkville is not for everyone."}
{"text":"Went here for \"brunch\" after sleeping in. Really neat little place, but definitely wouldn't go in a big group. Background music was some French jazz-ish stuff that reminded us of the music in Inception haha.

Everyone was friendly and they let us try their house lemon juice. We ordered from both the savory and sweet selections. You can also see how they cook the scrambled egg on the crepe itself, which was cool. The wait was a bit long, but we didn't mind since we weren't in any rush. Everyone was pretty happy with what they got, but it didn't \"wow\". Still, no complaints at all - would definitely recommend the place to anyone visiting the area and will be going again myself to try some other stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"I went there again because my husband liked it. I ordered smoked salmon crepe with scrambled egg. The crepe smelled weird. It was too eggy in a  stinky way. The texture of the crepe is too soggy. The filling is too small I could hardly appreciate the taste. That's it, wont be going back ever. Found a better alternative: Pastel at Yonge and FInch."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are really small - you definitely will not get full of of these. The crepes themselves are well made, but there is not a whole lot of flavor, and the crepes are very expensive for what they are. The place itself is also small, and there are not many places to sit. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"My friend recommend this place for a quick snack. There is usually a lot of people in line as the place has limited seating. But today, no line ups and we grabbed the last table. Their speciality is crepe of course, I went for a sweet one - Big Ben Brie - brie cheese and raspberry jam. It was freshly made, served still hot off the pan. The crepe was thin, soft and the brie was melting out of the crepe. It ended up to be very messy at the end."}
{"text":"A cute shop at the corner of Yorkville and Yonge St bringing a taste of Paris to our fine City.

Ordered the Rive Droite (translated as 'Right Bank'  which is a geo reference to the Northern part of Paris) 

contents of crepe:
scrambled egg, sour cream, baby spinach, & smoked salmon

I didn't  feel a warm 'love is in the air' kind of service. Service was all business but was spot on.

The crepe was perfectly made and the taste combination was superb!

It was warm to the touch, made to a slight crisp. It is to be eaten in your hands like a sandwich (wrapped in a brown paper bag)

I visited during a quiet time just before noon on a weekday. 

Definite recommend - to dine in or take-out."}
{"text":"I was only in Toronto for three days, and I ate here twice.  The day I didn't eat here, I wish I had.  I ate a savory crepe and a sweet crepe.  I loved them both, but I have to say their house sweet crepe with brie and raspberry preserves was divine."}
{"text":"C'est bon, très bon, même excellent - dommage que les portions sont micrométriques. Pas de couverts, tout se mange en déroulant le papier qui entoure votre crêpe. Le menu est typique de ce qu'on trouverait dans une crêperie en France mais ici ça fait exotique !"}
{"text":"Fantastic little restaurant with a very cozy feel to it. Menus were beaten up but looked purposely so. Wait staff were also the cooks and all spoke French natively; English was their second language. They delivered the crepe in a paper wrapper and had you hold it as they peeled the edges of the wrapper around your fingers so you could eat it. No cutlery needed!

I had a crepe with just a touch of maple syrup in it for lunch and it was so tasty! Not too sweet and satisfyingly filling. Not bad for $8. 

Go! It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! They must have new owners now because the cool, French vibe is gone, along with the quality of the crepes. My crepe barely had any filling and my Americano was weak. There are way better places in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"J'adore Crepes A Gogo!

I've been hunting around for good crepes in Toronto with little luck.
But finally! Respectable crepes.

The owners are actually Parisian and French speaking!
We found ourselves saying \"Merci\" forgetting that we were actually in Toronto!  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Wonderful service for such a small and busy place.

Watching them make the crepes is like watching someone create a piece of art.  They masterfully flip the paper thin crepes over and if you order an item with an egg, they crack the egg right on top and scramble it on the crepe!

I was surprised by the menu.  There were way more savory choices than sweet.  The left side of the menu has cold items, the right side has the hot items. 

The menu has items with smoked salmon, tuna, and vegetarian options. No chicken or ham items if you are looking for any. But  plenty of healthy toppings spinach, tomato, olives.

Most of the sweet crepes don't come with fruit, but you can add strawberries or bananas ($1 for one, $1.50 for both).  They use real chocolate and have their own version of nutella.

This place charges for substitutions, but when you read the menu items, it seems like the toppings are put together for a reason.  

They charge for splitting crepes, but really, the crepes are a light small meal, there is not much to split.

When your crepes are ready, the waitstaff bring them over in a little basket.  They place the crepe in your hands and help you rip open the paper wrapping.

Crepes A Gogo  is an authentic creperie and I love eating here!

Note: They close early! 6:30pm on weekdays! That's why it took me so long to try them out. :P"}
{"text":"An authentic, Parisien-style cafe and crêperie with great food. The service here is fast and friendly, although their coffee is not the best from my experience (tastes watery), but that could be just me.

Prices are reasonable enough for breakfast, but select one of the more extravagant options on the menu and it quickly adds up. I usually stick to the basics - lemon and sugar.

Worth a trip every once in a while, the lack of a patio is the only let down."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. How addicted? When I first tried one, I went back again later. I've been there 4 times in the last 3 days.

This is better than what you'd get from a street vendor in Paris. The owner took her time in perfecting all the crepes on the menu and she will never put anything she doesn't love on it. Looking for a crepe with chestnuts in it? Don't bother going here, she hates chestnuts and will never put that on the menu.

All the staff speaks French and usually they'll speak to you in French and then in English. I almost feel inclined to try and order in French.

If you're looking for a Parisian experience, I recommend this place. I definitely felt transported to Paris when I went in!"}
{"text":"Crepes are nice but coffee barely drinkable and service is amateur hour. Three tables who arrived after us were served first. Not worth the energy, honestly. And if you do go, pick up proper coffee at Balzac's afterward."}
{"text":"This place is not the same as it was. There was a charm to this place when it was owned by whom I believe was a French-Israeli woman. She is no longer there and they have changed management since. The service and atmosphere are not as good. The menu is still the same but the crepes are soggier than what I remember from a few years ago under the old management when the crepes were hot and slightly crispier on the outside."}
{"text":"Very good crepes. Felt like I was in Paris while I waited in line - which was loooong and slow. It is a very small place and they don't have a lot of staff, so be prepared to wait. Fortunately, they are very friendly and again, the crepes are excellent."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Ordered two crepes one with goat cheese and basil, and one with strawberries and lemon churd came out to 20.25 I don't know how because the menu prices should've came out to be about 18 and change. Crepe with goat cheese had minimal amount of filling almost the entire crepe was just dough with nothing inside. The strawberry crepe had like two strawberries in it for a crepe thats almost ten bucks. Both of them where dry and for some reason I got nasty attitudes from both the girls working there. 
Much better crepe places in Toronto then this one don't bother."}
{"text":"Ever since I started reading reviews on yelp I have wanted to visit Crepes A Go Go...  ever since I realized Crepes A Gogo was by the Toronto Reference Library, I was even more desperate for a visit!!!

I finally had my chance when my cousins from Montreal came to town.  I wanted to take them somewhere \"frenchy\" for a late breakfast.

Crepes A Go Go is the first crepes specialty restaurant I have ever visted.  The experience was so special.  The owner (I think) was working the cash register and she was so friendly and accomodating to me, my little guy, and our bulky stroller - even though the place was packed and super busy.  We ended up sitting outside but she had tried to move a table and a few chairs to seat us at the back so we could have a quiet space.  

All around, I could hear french being spoken by the staff and some patrons.  My cousins commented that the french was the authentic French french and not the Quebecois french they speak.  

Our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly.  He took the time to make suggestions and answer our questions.  He even offered to take our picture - despite the fact that the place was so busy!  We appreciated this :)  

The crepe itself was fantastic!  I had  goat cheese with basil and tomato - the heated version.  Very gourmet-ish tasting.  Unfortunately it was a little on the light side ... I would probably need three of them to feel full.  At $8ish - $10ish/ each, it would be expensive.  

The selection of sweet, savoury, cold, warm crepes is pretty large  ... makes me wish I had a million dollar budget so I could try them all.  

Tried the Limonana since I read so many rave reviews.  Yes, it was quite tasty!!!  Reminded me of a non-alcoholic iced tea mojito.  Was it worth the three dollars???  Hmmm ... not sure yet ...  but, if you are wavering, just go for it.  You only live once, right?!  :)

Love the atmosphere of this place ... I will be back and hope you give it a try too!!!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation from the concierge at the hotel in which I was staying, I came here on a beautiful Monday morning.  This place did not disappoint and I enjoyed such a wonderfully colorful conversation with the owner.  Food was on point, service was delightful and I really had no reason to do anything else in Toronto as I felt so welcomed here.  Alas, other customers were coming in and I needed to move on, but do not be mistaken, Crepes a GoGo will be visited again on my next visit to Toronto.
Veronique is the best."}
{"text":"Ah-May-Zing!! This place is a tiny little gem that is an absolute must-visit. I will definitely be making it a point to go back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Only giving this place two stars because the crepes were decent, it was the service that was unacceptable. There were two young girls working there with the biggest attitude. They didnt even look at anyone in the face when taking orders, looked miserable and let out a huge sigh when I asked for a spoon for my cappuccino. Horrible. I will never be back. Worst energy ever."}
{"text":"Delicious crepe!
Had the tartinade, made with their version of Nutella and bananas... Glad I tried it! Will definitely order that one again.
The staff were pleasant but the place was so packed it took us about ten minutes in line just to pay for it after we had eaten. 
I have found out from a fellow crepe fan that the batter they use is not homemade, but actually purchased... So for this I must deduct a point. 
I think its sweet that you must eat it out of a paper bag, but I'm one of those annoying people who eats pizza with a fork- so the fact that I had to wait for it to cool because I couldn't hold the bag also deducts half a point."}
{"text":"You'd think that in this day and age businesses like this one understand the value of services as a product and not just the crepe.  This location has the worst services ever and I'm ready to tell the world about it..... Sad because their Bloor location has an amazing lady behind the counter. #yousuck #bubblehead #dégeulasse"}
{"text":"Crepes a GoGo is authentically parisian- serving the best crepes in Toronto! The staff are super welcoming- greeting you as you enter the quaint space. I frequent Crepes a GoGo regularly and look forward to each visit because I've yet to have a crepe as good since being in Paris!"}
{"text":"I drop by this place once in a while, on the run, as it's not conducive to lingering.  The limonada was too sweet for my taste.  And, in my first visit, my glass tumbled over and spilled onto my clothing from the wobbly grated pattern of the table.

I just read Henry P's review (1/18/13) so I understand how he felt.  Civility is quite important for me - especially in the general area where the Cafe is operating.

I was in my sweats (Nike Upmarket Stylish) on my way to Hazelton Hotel spa today + an errand run to Gingko for herbs and such.  After identifying which table I was going to sit in, I made a beeline to the washroom.  The owner, I presume, loudly spoke to me, and repeated, after I was shocked and didn't  quite understand what she was saying, \"Are you going to eat here? (I replied \"Yes\") Leave your bag and then you can stay after the washroom.\"  I \"can\" stay?  Unbeknownst to her, and I am not listing the following to impress but more out of concern, it was a Prada messenger that costs ~ $1,700, fur lined Armani leather gloves ...etc. together with wads of cash, plus my ID's and my car fobs ($850 to replace) for my Lexus LS600h (flagship).  And she wants me to leave it unattended next to the entrance?  Imagine the hassle if someone swiped it.

It's not so much as the request (which I really couldn't understand in the first place - was I going to steal toilet papers?) but the way she almost \"barked\" at me, with almost a foreced smile.  \"You can stay\" really is a little much.  Rather than making a scene (the place is full), I just walked out.

What was running in my head was, \"Did she have a bad experience with Asians?\", \"Was I too casual\"?

I hope she enjoys her 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Went here one evening for crepes with friends. This creperie reminded me of the little cafes in France. Ordered the one with strawberry, labneh and sugar and absolutely loved it.  The hint of goat from the labneh gave a subtle savouriness that paired well with the strawberries, when combined with the sweet crunch of the sugar, the crepe was absolutely delicious. The staff were also very friendly and welcoming.  Also tried the limonana which was very nice, clean,  minty and not too sweet. Triwd the one with raspberry jam and mozzarella the next day and also enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Dropped in Monday just before noon with a friend to beat the lunchtime crowd and found the place already filling up. I would classify the surroundings as modern and fresh, with predominately white cabinetry and tables. Although small, the bright decor made it feel larger. We both had a savoury crepe and split a sweet one for dessert. Service was quick and the coffee, hot chocolate, and crepes were excellent. The cost was reasonable and the quality typical of what one would find in a high-end French restaurant. The menu also contained a variety of salads which I think I'll try next time."}
{"text":"The food is always great. It took 50 minutes to get 2 crepes! The place had no line up and the tables were full, but still... Almost an hour for 2 crepes? If you have all the time in the world, this place is wonderful. Otherwise, for a quick meal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Way worse than before.  Bad service. Crepe was used to be crispy and thin before,  now it was all soggy.  I ordered St. Laurent, they are no longer using thick and real Black Forest ham,  but just regular cold cut ham.  Will not return!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Crêpes à GoGo, service was excellent and the food was amazing! Best crepes by far. Also, felt like I was in France as the whole staff was speaking French to each other."}
{"text":"I've only had their savory crepes and they are fantastic! I NEED to go back and try their sweet ones.  The place is super small and the smell will make you super hungry really fast haha.  They bring it to you and its wrapped so you can eat it with your hands. A thin crepe with a perfected batter.  i can't get enough!

The crepe itself isn't huge, but your satisfied at the end.  I could probably eat two to myself though, but I'm a pig.  I've tried popeye - scrambled egg, mozzarella and baby spinach. and I've also tried parisienne - scrambled egg, swiss, mushrooms, red, onion and dill.  Warning that the dill has a stronggg aftertaste. I think they kinda skimp out on the ingredients a bit but its still good!"}
{"text":"Although the crepes actually do taste okay, the employees and what I assume to be owners/management do not know how to work in a restaurant unfortunately. Because of proximity my boyfriend and I have ordered from this restaurant numerous times, and each time more disappointing then the last. We will no longer go there anymore. You can order on the phone and arrive to a empty restaurant in the time they would tell you your food would be done (20 minutes) and all you'd see is the staff chatting on the line, not even having started your food. You can order there and similar issue, always chatting. Never focused. It's as though it is a pain for them to serve you."}
{"text":"This tiny little place just two blocks north of Bloor, right at the crust edge of Yorkville, has move European je ne sais quoi than many much larger so-called French and European restaurants in Toronto!

The customer seating area, where the tables are, is perhaps even smaller than my living room. For some that could be a bit of a bad thing however personally, if you go early in the morning, the place reminds me to a hole in the wall you might find in Montmartre or in a non-touristy area of Paris.

Their Crêpes are tasty, hot, made on the spot and unlike other places, the crêpes are not perfectly shaped, or as presentation friendly, which in reality I think it *adds* to the rustic and personal touch this locale already exudes. Which to me is very refreshing. 

During the summer months you will find a number of customers hanging just outside, seating on the bench enjoying their crêpes. Which by they way, they will give to you in a paper bag in case you want them, you know, to GoGo.

As far as large groups? Don't. If you have a group larger than four (and that's already pushing it) then consider yourself lucky if you actually manage to get a table, specially during brunch hours. There are line ups.         

Lastly, the service, they are French --at least the ones I talked to. They are friendly and sometimes depending when you go, they are a bit rushed, but not enough to give you the impression that they are rushing *you.* They are just busy. 

I live about 7 minutes away walking it, so I try to go there from time to time and I recommend it to anyone who would prefer to try something different, something more than the assembly-line vibe you get at other crêpes places."}
{"text":"The staff are *actually* French!! 
Like, legit...
Good, so good, little frenchie things all over the place, cute cute cute!!!"}
{"text":"Surprised they're open on family day, but had the cutest brunch here. All the crepes are between $7-$12 so pretty decently priced. The decor is so beautiful, it's what I want my house/kitchen to look like. 

We went all out and ordered a savoury and sweet crepe each. I got the \"Tom Tom\" smoked salmon crepe and it was delicious! Then I followed that up with the \"festival\", which just had cinnamon, sugar and strawberries. Perfectly simple and perfectly yummy. 

Oh and don't forget the limonana drinks! I haven't found these anywhere else, but the lemon and mint is so good!"}
{"text":"Argh! Don't know whether to get up and order from the cash or wait for the non existent waiter. Don't ever come here on the weekend. It's too busy and they sound like they're arguing all the time in French. Waited for almost 20 minutes to get our orders in because the waiter forgot about us. People that came in after us had already gotten their drinks. Basically terrible service.

We ordered the Madame and some sweet dish, which I apologize to say I have forgotten the name of, but it had strawberries, cinnamon and sugar in it. We also order the lemon mint drink that people are raving about. The waiter forgot about us again and we finally flagged him down to get us our drinks at least. They had run out of the half liter and we ended up getting the full liter bottle to share - it was way too much for us and we ended up leaving the rest when we left. The lemade wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be. It tasted like watered down lemonade and mint.

I can see that our crepes where done but they were just sitting there for a very long time. We flagged the waiter again and he told us that only one order was done, when we specifically asked to send us whatever was ready. He came back and he told us that both orders were done already, which I already knew. The crepes were cold and dry and too thick. To be honest, the crepe was not worth the $22 dollars I spent all together. 

This place was too expensive for the quality of service and food. I may come back during the week to see if what everyone else sees in this place, but when would that be? Who knows."}
{"text":"I am so pleased to say the new management are incredible, the first time I came here for dessert the old owner was incredibly rude and pompous. The new owners are so kind and helpful. 

I was pleased to see some new additions to the menu. My boyfriend and I opted to split the St Germaine for a light lunch. It was delicious! The portion was huge and perfect to share. I will definitely be returning soon to try out one of the new dessert crepes! My new favourite spot in Yorkville!"}
{"text":"Hot crispy savoury & rich-flavoured Saint Germain crepe! It has chicken, a layer of mozzarella & mayonnaise inside. A great treat on a snowy Toronto warm winter day :D"}
{"text":"Anytime I want an authentic crepe that takes me back to Paris - I come here! 
St Tropez is one of my fav crepes it is on the savoury side. I recommend the Limonada for a crisp refreshing drink.

I heard they changed owners recently. Not sure how that has affected things."}
{"text":"Saturday morning. 11am. Wow this place is incredibly busy. With only a handful of seats here, don't be surprised by a 10 min wait, or you can cozy up to the 4 seats in the bar area. 

It's interesting how if you want to add or delete items from their pre-set crepe recipes, they make a face and highly recommend you don't. They are probably right. 

Got the Quebecoise today - maple syrup, egg and mozzerella. It had the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. Would have likes a strawberry in there too. I think I'll ask for that next time. 

The people here are friendly and I love that they wrap your crepe up in a way you can take it to go if you'd like. 

It did a while for my crepe to come, but I had a coffee and a magazine so I didn't mind much. Abut 30 mins later, I was done and there was a line up for 3 parties at the door. Do these folks a favour and don't linger around here to chit chat. It was a beautiful day outside, so go take a walk!!"}
{"text":"Although a little bit  to the too sweet side ( just a little bit for me) this place has everything I ever wanted for a restaruant~ 
I just love it ~"}
{"text":"Tiny place but so darn cute.  Love the simple decor.
Service was good and the crepes were great.
Highly recommend.
We had the Germaine and Vanessa.
Delicious!"}
{"text":"Please note if you're seeking the original crêpe à gogo this is no longer the right one run by Veronique!! Her only location is on Bloor and Spadina. We came here and could tell right away the crepes are different. When we asked if something changed and where's Veronique, the ppl just said nothing changed and she's just not there. If you want average/subpar crêpe, I guess you can visit this location."}
{"text":"Staff is inefficient, loud, messy with poor food handling skills. My crepes were placed beside the dirty dishes for ten minutes before they were served. When I mentioned this, their response was: \"but it didn't touch the dirty dishes.\" They did offer to make another but I was so disgusted by his point that I declined. The male server is all over the place - when he's not rubbing his nose or his armpits, while Carrie orders him around, he is multitasking between washing dishes; wiping tables, cashing out and serving food. - not really focused on one thing or another. A dirty wash cloth hangs off his shoulders, falling periodically onto the floor, only to find itself back on his shoulder moments later. Gross."}
{"text":"Slow service!!!! Over 15 minutes standing first in line at the register. Hire more people, I'm sure they make enough margins on these crepes. Also, charging extra for splitting a crepe? Unbelievable."}
{"text":"little crepe place that's pretty good.  There are the sweet, savory, and sweet/savory combination crepes.

I had the 'Big Ben' with jam and brie (sweet and savory) that is the signature item here.  It was pretty good.  My friend had the nutella equivalent with strawberries.  

Definitely worth trying out.  It looks like it won a 2008 award of some sort.  The place is pretty cramped.  We went around 11ish on a Sunday.  In total, there are ~4 two-top tables, then 2 more two-tops that clearly are fire hazards and some stools to sit on.  To go is worthwhile."}
{"text":"If you want a little French experience and you're hanging out in chichi Yorkville, head to Crepes a Go Go for a delicious Parisian treat. 

They don't have a huge selection of crepes here, or a lot of seating, but the crepes themselves are delicious! And because of the intimate setting and small space, you'll actually get to watch your crepe being made right before your eyes. 

I had a brie and strawberry crepe with spinach and maple syrup and it was soo spectacular. The cheese was perfectly melted and ooey gooey and the strawberries, spinach and maple syrup complimented the savoury cheese oh-so-well. 

The crepes are expensive either. Eight bucks for a hot, ready-made crepe is a good price in my books. Take it to go and wander through Yorkville for a truly enriching French experience."}
{"text":"Do you remember a popular scene of a Parisian Girl sitting on the outside Patio of a Paris Cafe enjoying the blue sky and white clouds while an Accordion & a Clarinet player plays upbeat Cafe music in the background? I had that \"Moment\" here at Crepes a GoGo this Saturday afternoon. 

Even the Staff and environment were all en Francais as we were given a Bonjour as we waited near the door and was given Menus in advance. There was a French phrase on the top which I couldn't fully make out, \"Eat to live and not live to eat\". It could have been the opposite and it wouldn't mean anything to me. Maybe it should be \"Eat to live to Eat...\" 

Hot Limonana($2.50) is similar taste to what Hong Kong Cafes would offer if you ask for Hot Lemon Tea. I chose this over Coffee Beverage since I'm having a Crepe as well and needed a light flavoured drink. 

Tova(Sour Cream, Red Onion, Smoked Salmon & Dill $9.50): 
It was a delight to hold the Brown Bag which wraps this Folded Crepe with both hands and feel the warmth from this freshly made Crepe. The heat from the hot Crepe cooked the Smoked Salmon slightly. 

Aside from that, what you read from the ingredients list is what you get. Look for that FISH logo next to the Crepe item because that is your sign for anything Meat or more specifically Smoked Salmon. The only other thing close to Meat related is the Boiled or Scrambled Egg. 

They even had a note in the hidden top corner blackboard noting that Strawberries are not in season as a friendly reminder. I found my overall experience quite lovely and service from the French Gentleman very nicely done.

P.S. The Accordion and Clarinet players made the experience memorable for me. Merci Beaucoup!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon to meet up with a friend. My Foodie Friend and I hadn't had crepes in a while so we relied on our favourite site, Yelp, to direct us into the right direction. Yelp, you never fail us!

I arrived a little before the meeting time so I went ahead and ordered a drink while I waited. I decided to 'play it safe' the first round and ordered the cafe au lait. I saw the people around me drinking a mysterious warm drink in a mug. Curious as to what the hype was about, I ordered the Limonana (a lemon and mint drink, which apparently goes well with alcohol). It was a perfect warm drink for a cold, cold day. 

Crepes were fresh and delicious. The Julia, with chocolate and raspberry jam, just melted in my mouth. From a glance, the crepe looks small, but do not fret! The crepes that are made on site are folded so the crepe looks smaller than is.... they're so filling though so don't worry!

The staff were all quite friendly and efficient with their cute French accents. It was crowded (in CAGG standards, which means there were about 10 people in the house), but the staff were all very attentive to the needs of each patron.

Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"oooooooh the quebecois crepe was so goooooooood..! merci merci!"}
{"text":"All of the ingredients seem to come from Loblaws. I wouldn't be surprised if the batter for the crepes is a mix that they just combine with water. I could make it at home.

The crepe has almost no filling, it's rubbery, it's not really tasty, and it's extremely overpriced.

I can see this place closing down fairly soon."}
{"text":"Crepes a go go is one of my favourite lunch stops. The handheld crepes are outstanding and filling. The Veronique has thinly sliced strawberries, spinach, Brie and maple syrup. It is perfectly cooked and melty and the best combination of flavours. I accompany it with the lemon mint tea bottled drink that's made in house. I finish with the room temperature finger crepes - Nutella and either bananas or strawberries. Yum I can't wait to go more often I the springtime.

Edit: they no longer have the finger crepes which is a shame."}
{"text":"Really good for crepes! Strawberry and Nutella is always the best combination. A little pricy for what you get tho."}
{"text":"I am very carb conscious. I typically do not eat a lot of carbs, but since Crepes a GoGo had just great reviews I thought it might just be worth it.
I  was not  disappointed. It was definitely worth it.
The friendly staff made up for the long wait.
The restaurant is small and I was lucky to sit outside.
I would HIGHLY recommend this place, but be prepared to wait.
I look forward to the next time I am in Toronto- I will definitely be going to Crepes a GoGo again."}
{"text":"The crepes were good. The service was quite slow and errors were made. They don't serve you on plates but rather you receive your crepe in a paper bag.  It feels like an upscale fast food joint."}
{"text":"Best crepes in the city. I love that there are both hot crepes as well as cold crepes. Try the Veronique. The Limonana is also delicious! Charming."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend of mine for breakfast crêpe. It wasn't really special and Im not sure sure if I will come back. 

Food: 2/5, I got the smoke salmon crêpe it was tiny and not that great. They have this drink called Limonada that's really good but I realize that they are really overcharging it here $7 vs like $3 or less at a pusateri's.

Service: 2/5, not great for such a small place. You have to go up to pay and they seem miserable working here: angry to pissed off faces.

Ambience, 2/5, nothing special.

Price: 2/5, overpriced for a tiny crepe $15 before tax."}
{"text":"Well bonjour little creperie. I had no idea just how much I was going to fall in love with you until...

Vivek S and I were greeted with a pleasant \"bonjour.\" 

The wi-fi was quick!

Housemade Limonana was placed on our table with a wink,  served in a small or large carafe. 
 
A folded over crepe was handed to me with a smile. And then the bag was torn and folded. What a caring touch. 

I took a bite of my perfectly browned and slightly crispy crepe stuffed with tomato, brie and basil Dani-mique. I could have eaten two, easily. 

Vivek S - can we please a gogo here again soon? 

24/30: 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Friends took me here as a pre-event tradition. It was so good, I brought another person back two days later. 

The savory crepes are excellent - I had a Mademoiselle one day and a Canadien the next, and they are so filling that I had to crib a bite off friends' dark chocolate and French chocolate and raspberry sweet crepes, as I has no more room for one myself. Cafe crema transported me back to Paris. 

Excellent meal, lovely help and a wonderful new tradition."}
{"text":"This little (and I mean little) restaurant is absolutely amazing! The crepes are as authentic as if they were transported here from Paris. There were two of us in our party so we got one savory and one sweet crepe paired with the lemon tea. It was a wonderful meal and I will definitely return here when visiting Toronto again."}
{"text":"I've always hang crepes cravings since spending some time in Southern France. This place is run by a lovely Parisian lady who just adds that touch of authenticity that lets you know you're not getting some hokey knock-off. This place is VERY cozy, tiny and you're better off grabbing you order to go. Most everything is good and I would request a fresh crepes just of the grill. The older ones are never as good. I'm a fan of banana and chocolate, but everything is good including their more hefty breakfast style crepes. I'm going to get another one today."}
{"text":"White chocolate banana and Dulce de leche crepe it's delish 
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars it's because even if you are eating inside there is no cutlery or plates and it gets messy. My mom had the Brie and mermelade she said it was amazing. If you are in the area and want some casual dessert, here you'll find it."}
{"text":"This was my first legit crepe experience and it was delicious!! Huge portions and decent prices"}
{"text":"I've always been more of a savory crepe person, than a sweet person. As they say, I'm sweet enough as it is. I've tried both the St. Tropez and Cote D' Azur, and I truly loved them, both, and as many have recommended, I also prefer folded crepes over rolled cold ones. 

Service here is right on the mark, and as soon as you enter you're greeted right away. (Of course it helps that there are just a couple of tables). Everything is prompt and pleasant. 

This is definitely one of the better crepe digs in Toronto. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Saint Germain, so delicous and made efficiently! Lovely staff aswell. Will definitely be back!! They also did a great job with the renovations. Cute place in yorkville and i would highly recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  It would get a 5 star if they hadn't forgotten my order and it wasn't 90+ degrees there.  
Got the Rive Droite and had to eat it outside at a nearby bench as the heat was intolerable.  But that ended up being not a horrible thing as it was lovely outside."}
{"text":"We came here in July/August in 2013. 

Wow! Well, let me start off by saying...we aren't in France and though many people in Canada speak French Canadian it doesn't give the owner any right to be so rude to her customers. I would expect this treatment in France, but not here. As a matter of fact I just returned home from Holiday and I was never treated so poorly in Nice, Cannes, Lyon, or Paris. 

When my boyfriend and ordered we each ordered a crepe and then one extra one to split. She asked which one we wanted out first and we said we would like them all out together. She then mocked us and said we couldn't eat our crepes that way and intimated us holding both crepes and shoving them in our mouths. It wasn't funny, it wasn't cute. It was just plain rude!

The crepes themselves weren't that great. They have nothing on Paris.

The waitstaff was rude as well. She pretty much made us order their gross homemade drink speciality that was so terrible. She also insisted that we order the large one. 

We won't be coming back. I suggest you go somewhere where you will be treated with some dignity and respect. To this day we still talk about how rudely we were treated."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great space. Second time visiting this cozy shop. Last time I had a crepe and a latte. I'm extra hungry today so I ordered two. The service is friendly and welcoming. The space is clean. These ladies stay busy and you can tell they love what they do. Definitely recommend if you're in the area! A little taste of Paris right in our city!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes that are perfect for breakfast. I felt like I was in Paris.

It does get crowded and is super tiny. But when you get the crepe and it's hot and steaming, you forget about it because you can just eat it on the go. 

Brie and strawberry jam. How come I've never had sucha thing before? Forget nutella. I'm in love."}
{"text":"WORST experience ever. 0 star if possible. Should have read the recent reviews before coming back. Used to think this is a little GEM in the hood but it's now nothing but a little GERM instead due to its untidy and dirty interior. 

My gf and I came here at 11:30am. 3 tables only who were already served their food. There was another pair of old ladies arriving the same time as us. Restaurant not full at all with only 5 table in total. 

We love crepe a gogo since 5 yrs ago and visits every once in a while. But this time it seemed different. While we were fine with not being served to our table, we seated ourselves in the back. 1st thing I noticed, dust and a dried FLY stuck on the wall. I didn't speak a word as my gf loves this place. There was a customer going to the washroom and the door slammed so hard without a working oil pump that the entire wall shook. Then a chuck of thick dust dropped in my water. I looked up and found chunks of black dust (probably mixed with cooking fume, like grey marshmallow) accumulated along the entire ceiling and on electrical wires connecting to the HVAC directly above our heads. Fire hazard, health and food safety red flags !! 

We ordered a Parisienne and a Julia crepe with one hot drink. The drink arrived few mins after which tasted fine and we just chat away expecting to have our food soon. 

As we wait (about 12-15 mins in), we saw at least 3 drivers from uber eats enters to pick up some orders. We saw orders being filled while ours are nowhere to be seen. Waited 5 more mins and saw the pair of old ladies already finished their crepe, paying their bill and ready to leave. At this point, we believe it is unreasonable as two crepes take less than 6-8 mins to make with the 2 machines they have. My gf is a little frustrated at this point and raised her hand to get our waitress (Indian lady). Despite such a small store and only 3 tables remaining including us, the waitress just ignored us. My gf spoke up finally and asked: \"Excuse me, when is our food gonna come ? We've been waiting for our food for more than 15 mins.\" And the reply she got from the uncaring blonde lady over the kitchen counter was: \"With Saturdays, 15 mins is normal\".  While 15 mins was not the issue, it was the fact that we blindly waited an extended period of time while other orders after ours get filled.  She wasn't even trying to rush our order nor being a tad bit sorry and she was rude. 

We immediately cancelled our order. My gf asked to have the manager/owner's contact and the blonde lady said she is the owner. She further reiterated 15 mins wait time is normal. But she stopped finding excuse when we told her it's actually been more than 20 mins at that point. We addressed our dissatisfaction that she should not prioritize uber eats orders ahead of in-store customers' when our order was placed ahead of others'. This greatly reduces efficiency and jeopardizes their operations as it drives away in-store customers. We expressed we would not return and wish them good luck. While the Indian, who did not even serve us,  rolled her eyes and said \"thank god\", the blonde with her \"all-you-can-beat\" look (inviting for punches in the face) gave a rather unapologetic response that they are actually doing very well. 

When I pay for my drink, the visa transaction did not go through and I asked to have a copy of proof of transaction cancellation and the Indian girl says \"God it's just $3.41\" I was very offended as I am the customer and am entitled to obtain receipt for all transactions. I told her: \"money is money, are you gonna pay for me?\" But she seems to not comprehend my sarcasm and actually replied rudely to my rhetorical question: \" NO you are paying\". Assuming she earns minimum wage, I wanted to educate her on how much time it took Canada to raise minimum wage by $3.41 to the current state of $11.25. 

I must say, nothing goes right in this place from order priorities to customer service and cleanness of the restaurant. The only thing right is their name. Maybe Crepe a gogo should really go and close."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this place, I felt transported back to the streets of Paris!
The crepes are good ( some better than others), the crepe is thin, fresh and crispy.
Favorite so far is the Nicoise: tuna, olives, zaatar....delish!"}
{"text":"I went here with three of my friends sunday at noon, we ordered the festival crepe and the caroline crepe. They were okay, but not worth the price. The staff seemed nice until we asked her to split the bill four ways. We wanted her to add up the price of both crepes and divide by four, but instead she split each crepe in half, but the crepes were different prices which made paying very hard. My friend asked to pay for the whole thing instead so we could just pay her back, but the staff just charged her for half of one of the crepes instead of paying for the whole thing. Then as we were figuring out how to split the price, the waitress was very loudly talking about us to a coworker. She was saying how we were making everyone so difficult and that she was being so helpful and we weren't appreciative. Also the price was way too high considering the the the $9 and $8 crepes should have only been about $18 or $19, but was about $23-$24. I do not recommend because the wait staff make the meal here very un enjoyable."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why I ever went back there. 

Their staff are rude and stuck up... mainly referring to those two blonde girls behind the counter. They're always bitchy and act like you're bothering them when you're ready to order or have a question to ask about the menu.

This spot used to be so busy and popular but ever since management changed - game over. 

Sadly the food isn't how it used to be either, the crepes always turn out leathery - which is fanfuckingtastic b/c that's just the quality i was looking for in a $13 crepe. 

Never going back again."}
{"text":"Well made crepe with good flavour. Nice enviroment for a relaxing breakfast in the morning!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome crepes. Charming atmosphere. There's a wait, but worth it, although you might feel a little uncomfortable settling in for a long chat with people eyeing your table. Tables are good for 4 people or so at the most."}
{"text":"On Sundays, I crave crepes. OK, that's not always true, but I did today, and this place hit the spot.

As noted by others, this place is small and has limited seating. Fortunately, there was only one other couple there when we came in (mid morning). We were instructed to grab some menus and seat ourselves. And then shortly there after, we were asked what we wanted to drink, and given a few more minutes to decide what to get. We splitted a campargnarde (egg, mozzarella, tomato & parsley) and a chocolat (dark chocolate & strawberry slices), and had a coffee, elderflower juice, and water. 

The beverage and the food came very quickly. The crepe was good. I felt the crepe was perfectly thin, and a good mixture of crispy and chewy. The taste was good as well. I rather liked that the crepes were in wraps that we could pick up and eat. The coffee was good. Unfortunately, the glass for the juice and the water had some little black specks of something or another in it though...I think maybe coffee grinds fell in? We picked them out, but obviously it would have been better if it came without this. 

I'd probably come back though. It's conveniently located. The price was OK (there are some other crepe places that are slightly cheaper). The service was quick and nice."}
{"text":"wow, have to say one of the best one yet, shouldn't be surprised, the owner is french ;)

fluffly, light, delicate crepe, all rolled into 2 rolls w/ chocolate and strawberry & banana slices.  They make their own sauce, not Nutella at all.

highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very tiny place with even smaller crepes! The waitress was very nice but the place was not organized at all. Also the lady making the crepes was a bit rude to my friend, he was ordering 2 crepes and she refused to take the order saying that it is too much and he wouldn't be able to finish it! Even after he said he really wanted both crepes she kept telling him to pick one because she would not make both for just him? 
We finally insisted that she makes them and lied saying the other crepe was for a friend. 
Yeah my friend ended up eating both of them in the 15min walk home and was STILL hungry. I had 1 crepe with nutella and strawberries [with barely any strawberries in them] and it was tiny and barely filling. Definitely not worth the $8 it cost. Maybe as a dessert after a meal but certainly not brunch worthy in my book."}
{"text":"Had a chocolate crepe (which was $8.99 IIRC) with strawberries, bananas (additional $1 for each) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (additional $2). The crepe was overcooked and rubbery. So rubbery that it chews like gum, and the three of us couldn't even bear to finish a single crepe. It has to be the worst crepe that I can recall eating. The attitude of the workers, like other reviewers have said, was not very friendly. I can't rate less than one star so I guess that one star goes to the good decor."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for a while, and I'm glad it did! This crêperie is really cute, and I love the white color scheme they went with. The girl behind the counter was quite nice so maybe they changed staff? She split our crêpe in half when we requested and she was quite chatty. 

We ordered nicoise, which contains tuna, mozarella, black olives, tomatoes, zaatar, basil and olive oil. I'm pretty sure they had some sort of red pepper in there as well. The crêpe was nice and hot, and quite delicious on a cold winter's day. 

You pay after your meal at the counter, and overall the atmosphere of this crêperie is lovely! I would come back to try some of their other savory crêpes."}
{"text":"This is the best crepe place I've been to in the city! Their crepes taste undeniably better in terms of quality in comparison to ones from \"I feel like crepe\" and \"Cafe Crepe.\" Really delicious.

If you go on Saturday or Sunday in the morning or early afternoon, the chances of you getting a seat are slim. The restaurant is quite small and has limited seating, but you can get the crepes to go. If you can get a seat, I think that this would make a really cute date place.

The owner and the staff are French, and they are all very friendly.

A note to people who haven't gone before: When you get your crepe, they will make you hold it while they tear and fold the top part of the paper bag."}
{"text":"Stopped by today after yoga and am pleased to see that business continues to be bustling at this adorable French creperie! I first discovered Crepes a Gogo when they had a booth at a Francophone festival at the Harbourfront Centre, then visited them at Bedford Rd., and followed them to this Yorkville location. Over the years, little has changed. The delicious food, authentic French atmosphere, and personal service are all still there. No live music on this last visit, alas. 

I had the Popeye (egg, mozzarella cheese, spinach). It makes for a perfect brunch crepe and the crepes themselves are light and not too spongey or dough-y like at some other places. They only have 2 griddles, so when it gets crowded, it might be slow. But nothing beats eating your crepe hot off the grill! 

Seating is tight -- this is a place to come in ones or twos, not in groups. I'd guesstimate the seating is approximately 15 seats. You can get your crepe to go (go) though, and there are some nice outdoors places to sit on Yorkville and Cumberland. 

As Wayne C. mentioned, painted on one of the walls is the phrase: \"Il faut manger pour vivre, non vivre pour manger.\" I love the poster from Godard's \"Au Bout de Souffle\". Nice touch.

The servers are really attentive and sweet. Most, if not all, are bilingual and many are native Francophones, explaining some endearing phrases such as \"now I bring you cappuccino with beautiful foam.\" And it *was* a beautiful cappuccino. 

I spoke a bit to the owner, Veronique, before I left. She told me about her creation - Limonana, a minty-citrusy drink that can be hot or cold. She makes and bottles the drink on the premises. She even gave me a bottle to take home! It is a sort of cloudy beige colour, and I was afraid it would be sour (I think lemon juice is one of the first 3 ingredients) but I was pleasantly surprised. It is light, refreshing, and sweet. It is now also sold at Pusateri's, Lettieri, Bonjour Brioche, MBCo, Chabichou, St. Lawrence Market, and several other delicious places in the city. As the website declares, \"when life throws you lemons, add some mint... and drink limonana!\"

*According to an article in the star, Veronique will be expanding Crepes a Gogo into the adjacent space previously occupied by Le Pain Quotidien! Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service,  took the lady more than ten minutes to find a menu.  And didn't give us any attention.  Food is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this business has hired me for some photographic work in the past.  I'm the photographer who took the \"limonnana\" pictures.  (They have been edited to look nearly like an illustration, but yes, it's originally a photo!)  I would love to say that this in no way changes my review, but since I got to know the proprietor on a personal level, it's hard to factor that out!  When the owner is around she often tries to give me a free lunch or coffee, but unless I'm having one of my brutal \"starving-artist\" months with only about $12 of billable work, then I insist on paying.

As crepes go, this is by far my favorite in the city.  If ever I'm in the neighbourhood, I'll make my way here for breakfast, second-breakfast, tea, lunch, afternoon-tea, dinner etc.

If you fancy something sweet or savoury, they have you covered.  The regular menu has hot items and the summer menu includes some cold crepes.  (Very yum and refreshing)

 If you are ordering off the regular menu often the fillings are VERY hot.  Even my thoroughly scalded mouth can not handle the molten contents nor can my sticky paws grasp the hot food for a few moments until it cools off enough to not damage me.

I only wished I lived closer and I would go every day!  Wait a minute... I'm a starving artist after all...  I can't afford to eat out every day.  So I guess it's a good thing that I'm just out of reach for a daily visit."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner (as in she ordered a crepe and I just mooched off her's)! This is definitely not a sit down place and more of a grab and go kind of place. The restaurant is very tiny and I can't imagine them having enough tables and chairs for their customers during the lunch rush.

The crepe itself was very delicious and I loved the pancake (usually it's too rubbery or salty or something is just off about it). Also, they don't provide cutlery or plates so there's a special way of ripping the paper bag holding the crepe in order to eat the crepe.

I think I'll come back here when I want a healthier fast food alternative."}
{"text":"This became a regular brunch place for us, we came here three weekends in the row, always order one savoury and one sweet crepes:) they always cut the crepe in half for us, so we can easily share!

We enjoy their crepes a lot, the decor of the store is also quite lovely:)

I do think they need to train their staff to be quicker at getting orders, processing payments.. we've witness a very flustered waiter and a confused cashier...regardless, I am a huge fan of small businesses, I will continue to support them:)"}
{"text":"Took my mother and sister-in-law here on a Sunday afternoon.

The place is small.  We were lucky it was kind of empty because there were 8 of us.

I got the Charlotte (sour cream, sugar & cinnamon) with strawberries.  It was ok- it could have used more sour cream, sugar and cinnamon since I didn't taste much of those things.  The 'salty' crepes were delicious!  My brother had something with smoked salmon and it was very tasty.

Everything is made fresh and the crepes themselves are a good size; not too thin, not too soft.

Try the GoGo Creme if you like hot chocolate.  Creamy and delicious!

I would definitely visit again and try some other crepes :)"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the way this place is now. I used to love it and visit frequently but now I don't think I will be coming back.

I paid almost 30 dollars for two crepes and a drink today. Thin, smushed and barely filling crepes. I wanted to order a coffee but the woman turned to my boyfriend and asked him if he had tried a lemon drink before, to which he said yes and then she asked if he wanted one or two and he said we would share, but not once did she ask me if I wanted anything else or if we were done ordering. I guess I could have spoken up but I felt like she was annoyed as us? She was really intimidating!

I got thumped twice while sitting down waiting for my food by the bathroom door, and when she gave our food to us she thumped into my boyfriend's chair. We couldn't wait in the front because the front door kept hitting me, and I guess the back wasn't great either.

I feel like this place has new management? It's the same menu, roughly, and building, but it's lost its charm and I feel like I'm bothering them by coming in."}
{"text":"Can remember the name of the crepe I had but it was the one with chocolate. It was delicious and fresh. The person making the crepes asked us how they were and was really happy when we said we enjoyed them which is nice to see someone working in the food industry who actually cares what people think of their food. 

I love crepes if they're done right and crepes a go go is doing them right they crepes are perfect and they're always full.

I had my crepe with the limonada and it was awesome and super refreshing I would have enjoyed it more if I had it with a savoury crepe vs. a sweet one but none the less on its own its a great addition to a crepe lunch. I'll be back here, but I also want to check out the location on Bloor and Spadina.

Its affordable if you're in the Yorkville area and now I'm questioning why I haven't come here more often."}
{"text":"Good place, yummy crepes but the place is too small and closing early."}
{"text":"Check out the menu description of  their most common ingredients. I was pretty surprised that they only use 1% sour cream! 

Came here with friends on a freezing afternoon and did not regret it - even in spite of the waiting. I had the TomTom crepe (smoked salmon) and it was a delight. True comfort food for the aspiring Yorkvillette. 

Come by here to practice your French and drink really, really good coffee. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Missed my stop for the subway and decided since I was at yonge and bloor I might as well give this place a try based on what I've heard from others about this place. 

Arrived at the place and I highly suggest you get the crepe to go. The waiter looked clueless and worked slowly. However, I won't be eating this place based on service. Got a crepe with cheese and tomato. Crepe was a good mix of chewy and crispy. Cheese oozed out and tasted delicious with the crepe. Would definitely revisit for the food but I will not be sitting down for my food as it delays the food's arrival!"}
{"text":"My favourite crêpe place in Toronto. Both the sweet and savoury crêpes are awesome. This little place has a great feel to it and they have all the little things down that really add to the experience, from the owner's French accent to the way she rips and folds the paper bag the crêpes come in.

On the savoury side I like the St-Tropez ($8) with goat cheese and spinach. For sweet, I stick with the basics and get the Tartinade ($5), which is their version of a nutella crêpe, and add strawberries and bananas ($1 each or $1.50 for both)."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Tres French. You're pretty much greeted with a \"bonjour.\" Great place to catch up with girlfriends (or your best gays). Pretty low key in the evening. Really lovely staff. They rearranged the tables and made others squish over so they could accommodate our table of three. A thoughtful gesture. It is a bit wee in here but it works. 

I ATE 
Salmon, cream cheese and dill crepe. A note that a lot of their crepes have egg in it and not many ones with cheese. AKA No ham and cheese at this one so if you're wanting something more heavy, I may suggest something else in the area or Cafe Crepe (who does have a ham and cheese). Also, their nutella crepe is another chocolate variant. That said, the salmon and cream cheese crepe was yum! 
And another PS no pop here. You're getting orangina or perrier. 
So a bit limited, in my opinion, on the options here but still a nice grab and go if you're in the Yorkville area. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Crepe it up on the meat options and I'm coming back. Otherwise, I'm go-going to Cafe Crepe because they have more hearty options. Still, a lovely spot!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny creperie, lace and pictures et al.The owner is chatty and a melange of different countries. The servers are french. My point is: it's totalement francaises!

I went on a very blustery Saturday morning in November to take a few very close  university friends from Europe who were visiting. We went to school in a French city and Europeans like crepes, so I thought Crepes a GoGo would be a good place to try out. 

The weirdness started from the moment we entered. The door was wide open, and since it was a very windy day in the end of November and I had a bad cough, I asked the servers if they could close the door. The guy eventually closed the door, but said that he was worried about what his boss would say and that he would have to open it when she came in! When you're on sleepy side street in Yokville, I guess keeping the door open shows people you're open on a Saturday morning, but it's a ridiculous tactic on a cold and windy November morning. This isn't Cote d'Azur, it's Canada. Use a sandwich board outside.

After we were seated and offered the menus we were repeatedly asked for our orders even though we had told them that we were waiting for a few more people. We did order tea in the interim.

 I wasn't a big fan of the crepe I had. It was a simple crepe with nutella. Mine turned to crunchy rock over the course of our conversations and I didn't bother finishing it. For people who know me, the fact that I didn't finish my meal will come as very surprising! My friends seemed ok with theirs.

For a place as tiny as this, the servers and the owners talk very loudly to one another. The service is very much like the cafes in France: no sitting around after your meal. It's a tiny place, and the demand is there, so high turnover is to be expected, but the boisterous service takes away from the cute, laid back European ambiance that this place aspires to."}
{"text":"This place is quite small and gets really busy..the girls behind the counter are really Gorgeous with caked up makeup and uberly platinum blonde hair... Ok now since that is the first thing I noticed here back to the ambiance.. Again did I mention this place is really small. We were seated next to teen and twenty somethings thank gawd the aroma of the food was pulling me back toward the menu and not my neighbours 25 times \"like, like\" loud conversation..
To test the waters I ended up ordering something simple like the Nutella Crepe with bananas and my friend ordered the Chaw Ko Laaat (so much for my French accent) Crepe which consisted of Dark French chocolate and bananas. So we received the Crepes  minus the plates?! That's the least you expect are plates at a sit down place..Crepes  came out in a paper pouch! The verdict it was not bad..was it the best in the city... No. Was it price accordingly yes, actually on the cheaper side...everything was under $20.00. Will I skip this place next time in Yorkville? OUI!!"}
{"text":"After all these fantastic reviews I had to go check it out.  

This is by far one of the cutest places I've been too, GREAT prices $6-$10 with tax included.  Also when you go try the apple cider it's FANTASTIC...I really want some now....

I only tried the savoury crepe and tonight I think after my wings I'm going for a sweet ^_^.   I'm not usually a fan of savoury crepe, a weird mix between sweet and salty I just never liked it but here...they were absolutely fantastic.  

I went on a sunday we found a seat pretty much immediately but the food does take a while to make but it is worth every second.  Unfortunately they ran out of that lemonana which made me very sad so I do have to go back for that as well.  

I had the Parisienne (AMAZING) and my boyfriend had one with smoked salmon...his was a lot better.  Can't remember the name...Sorry!  Just try them all!!!

The place is TINY though, so we were pretty lucky we got a spot immediately.  It gets packed....but oh man I would wait forever for these crepes ^_^ Makes me want to go to paris"}
{"text":"Fantastic, truly French crepes!!!! SO GOOD! I highly recommend the Cote d'Azur! Their Limonana is amazing too, well worth buy a jug and taking it home with you :) SUPER spot!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. The crepes are OK (as others have said, they're fine but not great), but serious service issues. We were told when we placed the order in person it would take 20 minutes (a long time for a crepe) and that they'd call us when they were ready. We waited 45 minutes outside with kids on a cold day. No apology. No offer of discount. Not a great experience. Not a place we'll go back to."}
{"text":"French/Francophone staff who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide excellent customer service.  The crepe I had was a St-Tropez and it was decadent, delicious and very savory.  I also had a Limonana, a lemon and mint juice I'd never seen before.  Very refreshing drink; not too sweet and not too bitter with just a hint of mint.

The location itself is quaint and the ambiance was very evidently French.  From the vintage movie posters to the old French tunes all the way down to the old varnished, aged wooden chairs and tables.  The cafe/bistro has an authentic feeling one might expect from a rustic creperie in a small French town."}
{"text":"Like others have said before me, the owners changed and this location is no longer operated by Veronique. This is reflected on both the quality of the food and the ambiance of the place.

The staff here is not as friendly as Veronique's staff. Two blonde girls were helping the customers as I came in, and both were very cold. I regretted coming in the moment I stepped into the place but didn't want to see rude by stepping right out. The place no longer seemed as cozy as when the old management was here. Crepes were very meh (mine was soggy). For the same price I'll just go to the Bloor location, which is Veronique's new location."}
{"text":"Never mind the fact that the ingredients are just dumped inside without any preparation, seasoning, etc, the crêpe itself appears to be a military grade stretchable material that will, sometime in the future, likely be replacing kevlar as the common type of body armor material."}
{"text":"I love how they do their crepes here. The scent just wafts into your nostrils as you receive it from the server who flips out the paper wrapping for you. I've only had their savoury crepes with Limonana for lunch, and it's surprisingly filling. I love anything with basil, tomatoes, and melted cheese! I'll be back soon to try the sweet crepes."}
{"text":"I felt the cashier that served me was rude. She was angry because I complained she gave me the wrong change. She didn't acknowledge it was her mistake and not mine. Also, the girl who was making the crepes was slicing the strawberries out of the box. It seemed that they had not even been washed. The interior was very nice and the crepes were alright."}
{"text":"The space is very small and be prepared seated close to your neighbors. We needed a table for 3 and were sat at their slanted bar table, despite the group of 3 seated near us taking up 5 spots. As more people trickled in, there were multiple tables of 3 seated at tables for 2. And then it gets very loud, and I could barely hear my friends right next to me. 

We each ordered a savoury crepe and a dessert crepe. They come in paper bags, and not even on a plate despite being very hot (at least they're quite fresh). The dessert crepe was way too sweet in the last few bites and it was no longer appetizing. Coffee is around $3 a cup and there are no free refills (but it's Yorkville, so yeah). The service was friendly and they were pretty busy and kept good spirits throughout the rush. Probably better to do take out when it's busy."}
{"text":"Try the Tartinade crepe with their own version of Nutella and strawberries if you're craving something sweet. You'll like it. Also, try some of their non-sweet crepes, such as St. Tropez. Perfect with coffee in the morning for breakfast. The owner of this place is really sweet too."}
{"text":"Went there a third time, got the Cote D'Azur. Delicious :)

edit: Initially called the crepe Cote D'Ivoire, no such thing as that sold at this crepiere."}
{"text":"Good crepe, but at 10$, you would think that the owner could adjust her attitude a bit. Perhaps things are different in France, but in North America, the restaurant business is also known as the hospitality industry, meaning that it is a service-oriented industry. I had personally been to Paris in the past and never met a French person with such awful attitude until today.

I had brought tea during my first visit to the shop and no one had said anything about it. Today, being my second visit, I brought a Starbucks latte into the shop and was ``told`` that this was unwelcomed, having the owner screaming at my server in French instructing her to take away my coffee, while I was in the midst of my meal. 
Seeing the confused look on my face, the owner behind the cash register quickly walked over my table, grabbed onto my lid and told me that ``In Canada, you do not bring outside drinks to restaurants. I am nice enough so I let you.`` Her words, not mine. I was dumbfounded, while the server poured majority of my drink into a coffee mug. Moreover, it was not rush hour at the time - there was only one other table in the restaurant, I did not understand why she had to yell. After finishing my food, I politely asked if I could have the rest of my latte, to which she replied there was none left. It was a venti latte that I took couple of sips of, which is way more than the amount of one average sized coffee mug.

Good food, the servers are very friendly, it`s a shame that the owner has such a strong sense of entitlement. While I understand where she is coming from in terms of her beverage policy, her vibe and attitude had made me extremely uncomfortable and I was unable to enjoy my meal.

Luckily, I am in Canada, and I`d much rather take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Crepes are 3.5 no more for me because I can't understand (and cannot accept) how it is possible to sale salty \"savory\" crepes not using Sarazin flour. To me, that is a lèse-majesté crime to French cooking and Normandie. That being said, the stuffing was fresh, quite tasty, thus would have deserved a 4 if with Sarrazin flour.

All crepes are wrapped in paper to be eaten with your hands, even if you seat inside (it is specified on the menu). For 10 dollars, I would expect and like to eat salty crepes with a small side salad and on a plate. Whereas you may want to take away your crepe, you may also want to have the option to have a real nice brunch with plates and forks whether you eat in.

 That Sunday, at 4PM, they were out of salmon (and there was no ham crepes). so I could not have the one I wanted initially... (I hate Pusateris... but come on, they could have gone there to buy some...).

Finally, I felt a little bit uncomfortable when the owner (very friendly with customers) was really straight with her staff (\"Hey, come on wake up!\"). For sure, it may have helped for the sustained quality of the food in this place but this should be, at least, more subtle or discreete."}
{"text":"Meh. Their crepes are decent. I had the lemon crepe and it was good but not great. Their inside is chic and small and there is no patio. Bonus points because the staff speak French. But the food is only OK, the crepes are flavourful but it just needs something extra... This place is located near the Toronto Reference Library and has weird hours. Double check the hours before you go. Not exactly a \"must eat\", rather a \"if you're in the neighbourhood\" type place."}
{"text":"Best Crepes in the province of Ontario. Owned and operated by a first generation French chef, employing many cooks from France, this is as authentic as it gets. Do not even think about asking for ketchup got your crepes.

Try their in house Limonana mint lemon drink It's great hot or cold."}
{"text":"New ownership - no longer the crepe a go go I craved.  Go to the Spadina location and original owner Veronique is still there!!!

The place is less tidy and clean.  It seems like the new owner added new wall painting/decor & made the place a bit overwhelmed and cheesy.  No more greeting in French.  The new owner has no French background whatsoever.  Service is mediocre at best.  It seems as if they don't want to serve you.  Crepe is simply an imitation.  If you had Veronique's crepe before, this is absolutely incomparable.  The crepe is thicker, less chewy.  I ordered the Big Ben, there is imbalance between the cheese and the jam.  Too much cheese.  The portion is slightly bigger.  I wanted a hot limonnana but they cannot make it for me (even though their banner promoted both hot and cold limonnana).  If this is Veronique, she would have made me one already even though I am not a true regular....only visit a handful of times annually for the past decade.  

Anyway, it shattered my cravings.  Just so happen hubby was around the St. George area recently and I've asked him to pay a visit at the Spadina location and see if Veronique is still here.  Low and behold, she is there and my hubby had a great time with his crepe.  Just like the old times :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place, great feel to it. The owner is the nicest woman ever and the staff are friendly. Plus the crepes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Franchement, le café crème etait fabuleux, mais la crepe au chocolat- pas fameuse. Désolé.

Really enjoyed the café crème but the chocolate crepe wasn't that great. Rather disappointing. Sorry to say.

I RECOMMEND: trying something else in the menu. Maybe a savoury crepe. 

EXTRA TIP: very limited seating, take to go or expect to dine quickly"}
{"text":"I LOVE Crepes a Go Go!!! 

We were lucky to get the last available table when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon!! A queue started a couple of minutes after we settled down.

The lone waiter is really nice and sweet. We were given hot Limonana sampler to try. Tasted pretty good... especially great if you have a cold or drinking it on a winter day!!

Crêpe Madame: Cream cheese, dill, red onion, smoked salmon & lemon  ($9.50)
- Cold rolled crepes, light and refreshing.. but I think I like the hot folded one much better!

Tartinade ($5.50)
- delish!! Just love that warm, sweet crepes... I want that whole crepes without sharing.. but my friend looking at me with that give it to me look!!
 
GoGo Crème: Petit crème & chocolate ($3.50)
- like a hot chocolate.. but not as sweet, a lot more smooth.. and just like a liquid dessert!

The services was quite slow, it took awhile before our order was taken.. but after that the food arrived quickly!

Prices included tax! They accepts all credit cards for payment but do prefer tips be made in cash.

I can't wait to come back and have another of those sweet hot dessert crepes all by myself!! NO sharing!!"}
{"text":"I stopped on by after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp and yep, it's a hit.

The vibe right off the top was authentic Parisienne, which I loved. The staff were super friendly, speaking French and what not, and even though i felt totally out of my element I was still comfortable. After perusing the menu I opted for the Cote D'Azur.

I love how at the bottom of the menu it reads, \" no plates, no cutlery! \" Still, I was unprepared when my crepe came to me, but the owner placed it in my hands and showed me how to eat it, even setting my book down for me with matronly instinct. 

Needless to say, it was delicious. The best crepe I've ever had (though I've really only had the Cafe Crepe/Orange Corner variety) and the limonana was delish too. Definitely have to go back before I leave TO!"}
{"text":"Among the best crepes I've had outside of France and Belgium. High quality batter, scrumptious savory ingredients, smooth and delicious chocolates and sweet sweets will leave you with a big smile after scarfing down your crepe. Fruit varies by day and is sparse in each crepe, true to the French style. Very nice service. Not much room so plan on walking away and eating on the go.

The girls making the crepes are quite skilled, too. You won't see any permanent bubbles or lumps in the batter. They spread it smooth and evenly over the hot plate and wait exactly the right amount of time before deftly flipping it.

Delicious!"}
{"text":"Damn, this place is French y'all. It took me back to my time in Paris, when every one of my actions felt like an unwarranted intrusion upon a more sophisticated culture. Crepes a Gogo is about crêpes crafted with love and care by the owner, who is omnipresent behind the counter, running the show in a steady and jovial stream of Français. They don't do plates or cutlery here, but hand you your piping hot crêpes in a brown paper bag, which they kindly and tear and fold down for you.

I rocked the tom-tom, which was salmon, dill and cheese. This is a definite must. One of the best savoury crepes I've ever had. I would have tried my date's crepes, but it's hard to share without plates.  The Limonana is not a bad way to wash down these Gallic hotcakes either. Super! Or should I say, super! (With a French accent, of course.)

Obligatory Title Pun: CREPE me up, before I GO GO!

Menu Readability: Orange isn't an easy colour to use on a menu, but this is tasteful. 

Need to mention: They serve a mean espresso. And pay at the counter.

What this place teaches me about myself: Sometimes finding a clever pun is trying.  But every now and then, WHAM!"}
{"text":"We came here for a breakfast in the morning and are so glad that we did! You can get the crepes in a to-go bag and easily eat them while you walk around the city or you can get them to eat at the restaurant. The restaurant is a little small and not everyone it servers will be able to get a table. 

We had a great varity among our group from savory to sweet and we all thought they were great. The waitress even gave us free samples of the Limonana since we had never tried it before."}
{"text":"Crêpes à Gogo reminded me of just how much I loved crêpes, especially savoury ones! I stopped by here for a quick dinner one night before seeing a friend's concert. These delectable creations are folded and served in a paper bag, so no utensils are required. 

I was torn between all the choices I had! A lot of them contain smoked salmon, which I normally love. But I wasn't sure how much I'd like it served inside a warm crepe. In the end, I opted for the Parisienne with scrambled egg, swiss, mushrooms, threads of red onion and filaments of dill. The combination was perfect- absolutely delicious! The dill was wonderfully fragrant and paired fantastically with the red onions and earthy mushrooms. I would've liked a little more scrambled eggs, but other than that, everything worked really well together. Best of all was the crêpe itself, which was inexplicably tasty! I would be very happy to just eat the crêpe plain on its own.

I proudly finished my entire crêpe (albeit with a little help from my friend who took a few bites). It was a little too filling for me, but extremely satisfying nevertheless.  Crêpes à Gogo recently opened a second location on Bloor and Spadina, so I might want to check that out soon. Can't wait to try their sweet crêpes!"}
{"text":"Crepes a Gogo is good for a quickly treat but the service there needs work. The place is pretty small so it's not really a place to sit back and have a little catch up session at. 

In the summer they have their little \"patio\" which again isn't really all that great, but for those who want to feel chic and act as if they're important then here's your spot. 

The crepes on the other hand are pretty good. So if it's a grab and go treat you're looking for then I'd say go here if you want to put up with the attitude of the owner."}
{"text":"\"C'est si bon\" probably one of the very few French phrases I know just because of an old commercial about croissants way back.  However, that's probably the best way for me to describe the food and drink I have tasted at this establishment.

I saw this restaurant before in passing, but it was usually closed by the time I got off work, but I noticed they had a booth at the Indulge Toronto at the park near Roy Thomson Hall.  At the park I had gotten a popeye crepe to see how it would compare against Kawaii Crepe in Winnipeg.  The verdict? No comparison.  It's just SOOOOOO YUMMY.  I feel like I was having an affair or something.  The popeye crepe was a vegetarian crepe; considering I am against the cruel and inhuman punishment against defenseless vegetables by vegetarians this was OH SOO AWESOME.  Loved every single bite, assuming you can get true love from food, this is it. :)

Today I went to their restaurant with my food buddy.  This time I tried their Tom Tom crepe which was smoked salmon, egg, dill and tomato.  After eating that it feels like I was having another affair. This one was so much more way better in taste awesomeness (grammar Nazis have a field day with that sentence).  The salmon didn't taste like the cheap kind either and everything in the crepe blended well.

One lesson I learned is if you want to split let them know in advance so they can cut it into two for you and your food buddy.

We also had their drink and after my friend got a taste test (since I already tasted it on the Indulge Toronto) we just bought an entire bottle.  It was a cool and refreshing drink.  The mixture of the mint, lemon juice and sugar cane drink was just right.  Considering what a hot it it was, it was very very refreshing.

I'm going back to the Indulge Toronto booth next Thursday.  Actually from the day I tried it the first time, I have vowed to make sure I go to the downtown location, brave the thick traffic, douche bag jaywalkers, maniacal cab drivers and psychotic cyclist for work every Thursday so long as that booth is out there ready to take my money during lunch."}
{"text":"All ya Torontonian crêpe fans out there, you can end your search at Les Crêpes à GoGo!!!

Of course this is no France, but it's the best crêpes you can ever find!!! Located on a quiet street in Yorkville, this crêperie offers the most authentic crêpes you can find in Toronto!!! 

The owner prides on her crêpativity by combining different ingredients that would make each crêpe a taste of Paris here in Canada. I went there on Canada Day and ordered La Québecois (ya, I'm scandalous like that) and absolutely loved every bite of it!!!! 

Try their limonana. This in house drink has a simple yet unique taste that would quench your thirst instantly and heighten your senses before you take a bite of their delicious crêpes!!!

Two thumbs up all the way!!!!"}
{"text":"We got this for delivery on a Saturday and it was fast and yummy. We had the sugar and banana, dulce de leche with strawberry and goat cheese with tomato and spinach. They tasted great, but I can't give five stars because the pricing was a little high."}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected but still decent crepes.  Very little filling. Just one crepe didn't fill my brunch apetite.  I ended up going to another restaurant for more food after."}
{"text":"What an incredible little spot. It was so delicious! Small place owned by a nice woman- so don't expect McDonald's type service. It's a great experience though and the best crepes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I went to Crepes A Go Go on Yorkville with my boyfriend and wow did the new owners ever do a great job with their Reno!  Looks so much better. They have added some new Crepes and said that some great salads are coming next. I will be coming back for sure! Great location and great service."}
{"text":"It's minus four degrees outside, windy with wet snow coming down and the door is wide open calling me in! Seeking food and warmth I run into there open door to find a very warm and quaint little crepery! 

Our French waiter greet us and says have a seat and he'll be over with the menus. He is very friendly, takes our drinks orders, and gives us time to go over the menu. I'm flipping the menu over and going up down the double sided page.....Our waiter returns with a glass jar of water and two glasses and asks if we need any help?

I think he sees my fustration. I ask where is the ham and cheese crepes?? He looks at me confused? He states we only offer Vegetarian crepes and fish. NO MEAT crepes??? I repeat (I suppose i was being to assuming) he says no sorry, I had my heart set on a ham & cheese crepe but our waiter was soo nice he offered some recommendations. In the end I took his suggestion of the Tova Crepe.

He was kind enough to offer to cut in half and wrap the halves separate so we could share as they offer no cutlery here. He returned with the two indvidual halves neatly wraped in a paper bag delivered in a wicker basket and our english breakfast teas beautifully presented in clear glass cups.

Tova Crepe - Sour cream, threads of red onion, dill, and smoked salmon.

The filling was very hot and portion huge! I was eating only a half but it was a substantial portion. The flavours of red onion and smoked salmon were strong and distinct. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. Maybe I was off put because I was eating hot smoked salmon and hot sour cream (both normally eaten cold).

I later realized why the door was kept open, it was extremely hot inside......I can't imagine how hot it is in the summer months?

After we were finished eating I was waiting for our waiter to return so we could order some dessert crepes. He never returned but continued speaking loudly in French with the cook the entire time with there backs to us so I couldn't get his attention. 
Also I would have never known you had to go to the cashier and pay at the end of meal if I never witnessed the confusion with the fellow diners seated beside me.
For the single crepe and 2 teas the bill came to about $15 bucks.

Service was pretty good (in the beginning at least...), not much variety to the menu (no meat crepes!), presentation is good but limited seating (12 max?).

FYI Do not drink the water in the glass bottles provided to you.....they don't wash the bottles after you use it they just top it back up with tap water after every customer leaves....gross!....there were fragments of god knows what floating in my jar!"}
