{"text":"AMAZING. Everyone from my work was talking about this place so i stopped bye. I got a chicken Souvlaki on a pita with a salad. SO fresh, and cooked perfectly.  Everything was very clean and cashier was very nice.  Customer service 13/10 food 10/10. This place is so good. The menu is simple and easy and kouzies offers delivery. EVERYTHING in this area is Italian, finally something different I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}

{"text":"Great value and great food. I had a pork sandwich for $7. It was huge and delicious. The owner is a very friendly guy who will make sure it is made how you like it. I will definitely be returning often."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and in addition to the breakfast plates I ordered the pork souvlaki which was amazing, so juicy and flavourful. The eggs we good and bright orange.  I learned that the owner is also the chef. He took the time to chat with us and explained that he gets his meats in unfrozen which helps with the wonderful juiciness and flavour.  Because I have allergies the gluten and lactose, the chef cooked up our potatoes without using the red seasoning that so many shops use.  We appreciated that as well."}
{"text":"Food is great, servings are huge,owner has got to be the friendliest person I've ever met :) 5/5"}
{"text":"I see why it has earned 5 stars!! A small cozy place felt like home more than a restaurant. Chris the owner & chef is amazing!! Could have stayed for hours talking. The food was excellent & way more than I could eat!! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast/lunch based on reviews and pleasantly surprised:) One of us had breakfast and the other three lunch.  Server and chef were both friendly.  Pork souvlaki pita was flavorful but not as tender as the chicken souvlaki pita - added feta to each for a buck:)  The gravy is excellent!  The burger was good, but next time will also go for chicken souvlaki.  Bacon is excellent! Nice presentation.  Was well worth the 20 minute detour off of our route."}
