{"text":"xl pick up pizza good deal. ghetto area  wouldn't walk there at nite. Chick taking orders kinda rude. Expensive for delivery but pick up u get what u pay for."}
{"text":"I would tell you how the food tasted if I ever received it. After two hours had passed after placing the order online, I decided to call the place to see what was up. When I spoke with a manager she told me they had no record of our order so she wasn't inclined to do anything about it, even after I told her that we had already payed for the food. Thankfully after contacting Eat Street we were able to get a refund, but our experience with this place was awful."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was great, Chicken Alfredo pizza was awesome and the wings were really good! Prices are great and the delivery time was just 40 min!!! Way faster than I anticipated and the food was piping hot."}
{"text":"Found a little menu under my hotel room door so I ordered. ORDERED a large half supreme pizza and half Hawaiian pizza with 12 wings half hot and half BBQ. I got a large pizza that was all supreme with pineapple on it and it was a little cold. Pizza over all taste not bad. The wings were ALL hot with no meat and were tiny. Not good at all. Got one small ranch. When I ordered some airhead took my order and the guy delivering didn't have a uniform or a light up on his car, you would have no idea that he was the pizza guy. And there was a bunch of his buddies in the car. My pizza was in his trunk with a bunch of his crap. I'm from SoCal so idk if that's how they do it in Las Vegas but damn."}
{"text":"The food was delicious I'll definitely be ordering from them again food was delivered below quoted time the driver was very friendly I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Yo so like I ordered a Cesar chicken salad here right.. I'm like all happy like \"oh look at me trying to eat healthy\" when I get home and open my salad I notice that the Parmesan flakes are blue green.. well that just shows that a burger would have never looked like that.. so no more salads from there for me.."}
{"text":"Horrible service. A delivery that suspends reality is here. U order any spefic requests. It will not have a happy ending. Just go with a national chain. This place is a disgrace. Its a place of frozen shit that Gordon Ramsay wrote, 'Frozen shit and is all of ur MENU FROZEN'? The food is always soggy. The food tastes like wet diapers. Horrible. Never order from this place again. Their hamburgers had to come from the fifth element. I wonder if their were cows there. Deep Space 9 approves the meat. :D Btw, 2 hours later i finally received my food. Save ur hard earned cash on this one."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! The girl answering the phone is not only rude, she's an idiot. So I call their other location (Palermo's) and the order never came. So an hour later I called Pizza Bella and within 40 minutes I got exactly what I wanted without any attitudes or BS... Thank you Pizza Bella. I will be calling you from now on....."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a crappy place depending on who is working.  I ordered from them a month ago, great service and food wasn't bad.  Tonight..  Whole other thing.  I used the same online ordering process they had before. They took my order, charged my card and no food came. When I called, they are saying I am out of their service range. The service who handles the online ordering is handling the cancellation..  Sounds like lazy employees staffing the place tonight.."}
{"text":"Checked into the Flamingo hotel and wanted some real Italian Pizza.. a friend of mine had told me about Romas Pizza. I must say the Pizza Was fantastic, Sauce was great and they were not stingy at all with the toppings. The delivery was free so i was able to tip the drive an extra couple bucks.. i will definitely be calling this place for a late nite Pie everytime im in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Even thou I'm a local we rented a hotel room in the strip for a friend's Bday party and found a flyer in our hotel room for Roma Pizza. We called and placed a big order. The guy on the phone was very polite and got our order correct even thou we had a lot of requests. Food was delivered in less than 45 mins and it was hot and delicious. Their Roma creations pizzas tasted way better than any of the chain pizzas in town."}
{"text":"Just received cold pizza. Slow delivery driver that went to the wrong building and had me waiting outside in the cold. On top of that, I asked him if there was a message in the box (requested a joke in special instructions)..he said yes so I tipped an extra $5. Turns out he was lying. So he made out with a great tip for giving us cold pizza."}
{"text":"I was for a week in Vegas and ordered twice at Roma pizza. Their pizzas were delicious! The crust is really good and the tomato sauce has a really great taste! I loved the Hawaiian pizza and the upside down pizza. My husband had the chicken wings and he loved them!   The guy on the phone was really nice and he took his time to explain me all their specials. The order came within 40 minutes and it was still hot. Their prices are really good too."}
{"text":"Their chicken Philly was very unremarkable. Their chocolate cake was, however,  perhaps the best I've ever had.  Melted in my mouth.  Best $15.00 piece of cake ever!"}
{"text":"CALLED AT 7:00 PM on Aug. 14th,  The girl was rude, put me on hold three times, and the third time, she said, \"I have to start with the phone number,one minute, one minute, one minute. and then put me on hold again.  13 min on hold altogether.   DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Do not order delivery! Stole money from me. Driver called and made me walk a block to pick up my food and claimed to not have any change when my food was $25 and I only had $40. A flyer claimed they delivered to room and that was a lie. It would have been okay if the food was good. Pizza tasted like cardboard and the chicken fingers were obviously frozen and thrown into a fryer. I called to complain about my change and the manager called back claiming he would send someone else with it back and never it."}
{"text":"Staying at Excalibur.  Placed an order for wings and pizza at 9:30 based on under the door flyer.Told It would take 45 minutes but it was closer to 30. Hot wings were on a par with Hooter's and pepperoni pizza was excellent. Large pizza and 15 wings for $20 ish plus tip.  This will be my go to dinner call. Guessing weekends may take longer as is all things Vegas."}
{"text":"I would rate this 0 stars if I could. Everything was great up until I actually got the food delivered and got it upstairs to my hotel room. The delivery driver was great as well, such a sweetheart. BUT, when I got to my room and realized my fries were not included and then opened my chicken sandwich to find ANTS on it.... I even had someone else look at it to make sure they were moving.... sure enough they were. I called the store and spoke with Tina who said that I would need to send a photo (after I checked the entire sandwich for bugs at this point) because she spoke to the chef and he \"swears there is NO way there are bugs\" and the manager refused to speak to me because it was so close to closing, (GREATTTTT CUSTOMER SERVICE) then she proceeded to hang up on me after that fact. It is now 2:07 am, and I am furious and hungry. I am expecting a call from the manager tomorrow morning when they open at 11am... I am BEYOND furious right now."}
{"text":"Rude customer service, food taste like garbage, I mean I've had better service from the person behind the counter at 7/11"}
{"text":"Worst service. I order on Grub hub. Only to sit any wait for 1 1/2 hours to find out there closed and I've been sitting wasting my night expecting my order of pizza.  Do not accept to get food for delivery from this place."}
{"text":"I hate that i have to even give ONE star because this place is horrible...Our office ordered from this place they tod us thr order epuld be delivered within 45 mins ok not a problem but then they called back at the time that the order was tp be delivered to tell is us that they didn't have the meat for one of the orders, we had five people ordering. So by the time the order came everyones lunch was over. Then the little girl they had delivering was rude, then they left off one of the orders and when we called back to let them know they told us we were lying and couldn't get our money back...THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER i will be notifying the Better Business Bureau"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is horrible. I would give this 0 stars if I could. Slow, like, over 2 hours slow. Cold food. Incomplete order. Runaround on the phone until they closed. No refund and no food. Unbelievably bad. Oh, and very expensive. Basically, they took my money and didn't deliver a complete order, that's theft. Not a drink or something small either, an entire food order."}
{"text":"We ordered the Greek pizza and it was great! My kids had the wings and fries and by the time we got our order it was still piping hot! The only thing I say could use improvement is the customer service of the driver. He just handed me the food and left didn't say anything to me ."}
{"text":"Okay food. Pizza was rather dry. The white pizza only had olive oil so it was very doughy. Order came correct. Customer service was great."}
{"text":"Estoy muy feliz por su excelente servicio, precio y entrega en un justo tiempo, él sabor de sus clásicas pizzas hacen la diferencia, se los recomiendo!!"}
{"text":"When I arrived in Vegas it was late, after checking into my hotel I was to exhausted to leave for a quick bite. This pizza joint seemed legit plus delivery was free. I placed my order using the Yelp app which provided me with 10%off towards my order. The cut off time for online orders was 1:45a.m. as they closed @ 2p.m. I ordered with plenty of time for my food to be delivered. I waited for over two hrs for my food to be delivered. NOTHING. So, this afternoon I call to find out what the problem was. The front desk wouldn't release my floor number since I didn't included my full last name with my order. The driver claimed he called my phone but it went to VM. I didn't receive a call. All and all I woke up the same way I laid down... Hungry. Here's a tip... Included your Full last name, floor and room # in the comments section if you order online."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza for \"free delivery\". They charge $3.00 to use a credit card to pay for your meal. My $11.99 pizza was over $16.00. Not for me and I haven't even tasted the pizza yet."}
{"text":"Saw the commercial like 30 freaking times decided ... It's open why not ... This place turned out to be awesome !!"}
{"text":"Good, tasty pizza & fast delivery!"}
{"text":"First and last time ordering from here. Waited over an hour to get cold French fries which looked like wedges, burger was already tough, and ordered a a few sodas with one of them that was empty and spilt all in the bag. Rang them to get another, the guy on the phone said well bring another right up. 12 hours later still waiting. Not even worth a star. Shut this place down."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious i am a picky eater and they are the first ones to make it just right. I ordered a pizza with very light cheese, pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms, and pineapple. I dont like cheese i just need a little to keep all my toppings on. The sauce is delicious and it was the perfect amout of cheese. :)"}
{"text":"Took them 3 hours to deliver my food... Not only that my food was eke easy after the first hour but they had to wait for an available driver... Got my salad with no dressing and I asked my burger to be medium rare and it was overcooked..."}
{"text":"Didn't want to order at first cuz I saw all the bad reviews, but I did any way cuz I was hungry and too tired to go out in the heat and get food. Ordering over the phone was easy and they came straight to my hotel room. Pizza was a thin crust but not super thin like ny pizza , it was super good. Also got the meat calzone and it was huge definitely big enough for 2-3 people. Highly satisfied"}
{"text":"Great pizza....saw a commercial of there's and had to try it. We had about 20 pizzas delivered to a house party and it was on perfect time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very irritated that I was charged for food that I never received.  First I placed the order online, got the confirmation, and after 30 minutes of waiting past the scheduled delivery time I called to see what happened.  The guy on the phone told me they couldn't get a hold of me (even though they emailed me the confirmation with my phone number attached) and they don't make deliveries for items less than $10.  I told them to cancel the order.  The next day I looked at my bank statement and noticed they still charged me for the food I didn't get.  I called them back and the lady I spoke with said the manager took all the paperwork home with them so she couldn't look up my information and she would get back to me.  She called me back a day later to say her manager still didn't get back to her but she went ahead and found my information then reversed the charge.  It's been almost a week now and I still did not get any money back.  If you cannot deliver orders that are less than $10, your online system needs to be set up so it doesn't allow you to place the order until you hit the minimum.  See Cappriottis online system, they've got it right.  Now I have to dispute this charge with my bank because I'm not getting anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Ordered food at 2:29 pm and was promised delivery after 45 min. I called them back at 3:35 pm to ask them where the food was and was advised any minute the driver was gonna pull up and was offered 15% off. Seriously??? Called them back at 3:59, an hour and a half after the food was supposed to be delivered to cancel my order, the lady who answered the call said I was charged already like I had no choice but take it. Delivered at 4:05 pm. IF you guys wanna STARVE and willing to wait more for 1 1/2 hours go ahead and order!!! It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok for a Friday night at midnight this delivery was as quick as it gets. I literally can't believe they made a pizza this fast. It's very tasty too."}
{"text":"We were craving buffalo wings during the night, so we called this place because a flyer was under our door. The arrived around 50 minutes after we ordered, but they delivered it to the door of our hotel room so it was worth not having to go all the way downstairs and meeting them in the parking lot (like I have had to do multiple times with other places). Plus, our room was located in a tower pretty far away from the entrance. However, food was still hot and it tasted great! I hope I remember this place next time I am visiting."}
{"text":"Their food sucks and they illegally break into hotels and go to each room leaving menus under the door!"}
{"text":"Dont"}
{"text":"We ordered and got the pizza and cheese bread delivered to our room a little more than an hour. Both were barely warm but we were starving and also asked for sides of ranch. From our standpoint it was decent pizza wish it was hot but was still good we destroyed a medium which was on the small side."}
{"text":"Terrible! Stayed for the weekend in Vegas decided to get delivery at 12am and I received it at 1:22am. Called to complain they weren't able to do anything because I'm not a local. So unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Delivery in Las Vegas takes time folks! Especially during peek traffic hours! It took 45-60 minutes to deliver, the calzone is so good, so good that I won't be getting a calzone from my best friends pizzeria in LA, any longer! This places calzone has altered my opinion of a good calzone! The salad was fresh and crispy the chicken wings were delicious.  The food was so darn good, I can't say enough. Please review the other reviews, they all complain about the delivery taking too long, in one of the busiest cities in the world. A 3 mile drive here can take over 30 minutes, that's reality. If ordering for delivery expect an hour to get it, it will be warm and good to go, if you can not wait go to them! Or problems with a credit card charge, boy I wonder if that winner even tipped the delivery man? Probably not! We placed a 30 dollar order tipped 5 bucks. The delivery man was beside himself happy with the tip. Come on people treat other people with respect, especially if your getting a small order! A 13 dollar sale makes the business what $4 profit, come on people get real with the ridiculous reviews.   This place is unbelievable! We finished everything including the marinara sauce, so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Service ever!!!!! I placed my order at 9:30 pm, it is now going on 12 midnight and I have yet to receive my order."}
{"text":"Been a customer here for a good long time now. Their pizza is the best! Especially the one with the vegetables, everything's freshly served. My favorite is their spaghetti which is the best and if you're actually basing it on the price. You'll actually get more than what you're paying!"}
{"text":"Somebody tell Roma's that a pizza has sauce and cheese evenly spread on the entire pizza with a little crust on the end. The majority of their pizza makers make a pizza with 2 inches of  bread and crust around the rim of the pizza where sauce and cheese are supposed to be. The dough is shaped like a bowl instead of being flat And on a $5.00 size pie. Why don't they know this ? I have had good pizza there and that's why I have come back but lately its exactly like I described. Also inside its filthy with dirty tables, garbage everywhere and employees walking right past it as you sit next to it waiting for your order to go."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza & 12 wings online. I got a call from the delivery driver asking where my building was. He arrived dressed like he was on his way to a rap concert with his friends. He delivered a decent tasting pizza & 10 tiny wings that clearly came from baby chicks, not fully grown chickens. No the 12 & 10 are not typos. For $20 I was thoroughly underwhelmed. My first & last time ordering."}
{"text":"Ordered a 14\" pizza pie at 10:17pm with an estimated wait time of 50-60 minutes. This place was 0.9 miles from the delivery location so we weren't expecting to wait so long. At around 11:30pm, I called to check the status of the delivery and the woman who picked up said the food is out for delivery and should be there soon. The place closed at midnight, but I called again a few minutes before they closed to check again and someone picked up only to hang up on me. I tried calling twice again, but they let it ring both times until it went to voicemail. So now it's been more than 2 hours since I placed the order and I just disputed this charge with Seamless directly.  Tldr; Don't bother ordering from this place and expect a timely delivery or a delivery at all. Ended up starving for the night."}
{"text":"It took over an hour for me to receive my food and when I asked to speak to a manager I got the run around will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, good customer service, but the pizza is mostly crust and bread. I was really craving tomato sauce and lots of cheese."}
{"text":"Pizza is average nothing special,  sauce kind of bland. I asked for extra crispy french fries these are so mushy and oily they're just flat out nasty. Picture attached to see if you would enjoy these fries!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. After a two hour wait for my cold pizza the owner called me and said he would give me a refund only after his driver came back to pick up the food. I told him I didmt think I would be awake for another 2 hours and he hung up on me."}
{"text":"Good cheese pizza. Delivered, on time, friendly. Decently priced, and pizza resembles New York pizza."}
{"text":"This place had one of the best red pizza sauce and a great garlic butter sauce I have had. The cheese bread was Good as well. Good price on the pizza and tons of cheese, don't forget the napkins because you'll need them."}
{"text":"Yelper beware, I should have read the reviews. My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to order take out so we can just relax on our New Years day. Ordered through Yelp so Eat24 ... delivery rstimated 45 min to 60 mins. Okay no biggie it New Years day in Vegas. An hour comes I call to get an ETA on our order and the lady at the resturant was clueless after holding for 5 mins I was told the girl driver just left and is on her way in less then 10 mins. 40 mins later the order gets here and the pizza is cold not even luke warm cold. The ranch for the salad was for a small side salad not the nice sized dinner salad. I called the resturant to let them know of the issue but all I got was oh I am sorry, no let us get a hot pizza out to you right away nothing. Called Eat24 and they refunded me my money. Sadly I will never order from this pizza place again. I understand warm food but cold food is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm and cheesecake for delivery at hotel. Since I am at hotel you would think they would have checked for silverware. Nope, driver left and I opened everything with no silverware. So ended up having to get dressed and go to first floor and scrounge for silverware. By the time I got back meal was cooler than when received. I called and the lady tried to tell me they put silverware in there. If they had why would I be calling? Totally ruined the takeout delivery experience because I still had to get up, dressed and go looking for silverware. First impressions are key in business and this was not a good first impression. Lady did not offer anything in return. Said she would send driver out once back. Food would have been cold cold had I waited for that. Fail..."}
{"text":"Don't even bother with this place. Delivery took over an hour and on top of that the delivery guy called me and made me meet him outside,  he would not Come in the hotel.  The pizza and wings were cold when I received them and the pizza is such low quality and expensive I would prefer a frozen pizza,  that would taste much better,  I'm serious,  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"This restaurant's number is saved in my phone lol Every time I come Vegas I make a special trip over to this place. Delicious food and very affordable! They always have great carry out deals."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, food is mediocre. Girl taking orders is extremely rude and unprofessional. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant using my GrubHub app which was so easy and convenient to use. This was my first time ordering from GrubHub and I have nothing but positive things to write. My food arrived as promised, within the allotted amount of time, hot and delicious. The delivery driver was courteous and the restaurant  followed my special instructions to a T. We ordered a pizza and a Philly cheese steak sandwich, both were very delicious. Thanks Roma's pizza and GrubHub. GrubHub must be an awesome place to work with wonderful employees."}
{"text":"You're crazy if you think this is a pizza place.  You'll see about a dozen people go in and out in about 2 minutes time, never walking out with any pizza.  Obviously a front in this part of town."}
{"text":"always bomb..ordered some burgers this time ... it was a  great choice!! cheaper than McD ..and i know it doesnt take much to be better than McD's ..but none the less great burger ! thanks"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here many, many times and it's always so good! There lunch specials are amazing, the calzones are my favorite! Subs and really good too! Delivery is always on time and food is always warm! Pic is of the ham/cheese calzone lunch special. Comes with a coke or pepsi :)"}
