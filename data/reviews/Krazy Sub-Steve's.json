{"text":"I have been a loyal customer since 1999. Makes me sad to right a bad review but since high schools closed their campuses Steves place has deteriorated tremendously. I went in as usual for lunch ordered my sub and returned to work with the wrong sandwich. I ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items. I called spoke with a nice man who said come in I will write ur name down. I did and 4 people playing around in the back told me I need to speak with owner which I said no problem and their response was he is out of town. They all thought it was funny and I was so upset. If Steve's crazy sub ever goes out of business it will be because of the horrible customer service from his teenage and one grown man who seem to not care if customers ever comeback. Steve please read this and several others I have read that your staff needs to go. I hope someday I will be treated as a customer and maybe even get the sub I paid for."}
{"text":"Took a chance and it was worth it. Affordable prices. Turkey avocado sends you into deep waters sooo good."}
{"text":"The lunch special is a good value. The Mac salad is surprisingly really good. The hero was very tasty and nice size. Staff is real nice. They move the line at lunch and fill your order quick. Interior kinda looks like a day care center and that annoying cow bell on the door has to go so I usually get it to go. Good lunch spot."}
{"text":"There is nothing \"Krazy\" about this place. If they this place trult wants to own the name \"krazy\" it needs some lessons from somewhere like \"Ike's Love and Sandwhiches\" Very run down. Bottom line, it's a sub-par sandwhich shop and has nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time. Had a \"Super Sub\" which is like an Italian. Bread was very fresh. Cold cuts and cheese of decent quality. Taste was excellent. Very cheap price for what you get. 
 Only thing holding back a five star rating is cleanliness. Floor was dirty, and needed to be swept. Tables needed cleaning. Worst of all was the bathroom. It was filthy! Plus no toilet paper. Even after being told."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but it's not in the best commercial center in Phoenix and it feels a bit run down when you arrive and enter.  People are friendly, parking is good.

The roast beef is almost a home run since it's made the way I like it.  Really nice slices of beef, shredded lettuce, mayo, mustard, and tomatoes.  Nice balance to everything.  But...the bread was on the dry side and it made me wonder how good the sandwich could have been with fresher bread.  I had a couple of bites of bliss but mostly disappointment in the end.  

I'll probably give the place another try and hope the bread issue was an outlier.  If the bread is consistently good I can imagine myself eating here quite a bit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere: Mom and Pop deli. Clean and friendly. 

Service: The sub was finished pretty quickly. The gentleman that took my order was pleasant. I dined at 2pm on a Thursday and there was only 3 other guests in the place. 

The food: the deli meat and cheese was fresh. Tasted great. The bread was way under par though. I found myself wishing I had subway bread instead of the bread I had here. It was tough. Almost had to tear it with my teeth to take a bite. It had a stale Italian baguette flavor and feel. I prefer bread like Dibellas or like Amiels where it's always home cooked delicious warm bread. To each is own though. 

The price:
$6 for a 8inch or $7 for a footling. That's fair. A good lunch under $10."}
{"text":"The best way I can think of to describe Steve's Krazy Sub is that it is like Subway, but better in almost every way. They don't have as many bread choices, but the bread tastes better. Basically all of the ingredients taste better. The first time I went, I had the Poorboy, which was delicious. Second time, I had a Super Sub, also delicious. Next time I will probably get my Sandwiches without Mustard though, because it is a little overpowering. Can't forget the pickles, which are delicious!

My absolute favorite part about Krazy Sub is the prices. For comparison, Subway has a $6.00 Box lunch special, which only has a 6\" sub, then you add on the tax. At Krazy Sub, You can get one of their lunch specials, which also has the drinks and chips, but with a FOOTLONG sub for $6.00 after tax! Suck it, Subway! Also, the subs are generally cheaper. The smallest size, their \"mini\", is an 8\" sub and the prices are comparable, maybe cheaper, than Subway's 6\" subs. 

The people here are pretty friendly, but the owner is especially friendly. He always has a smile on his face and loves talking to the customers. When I was leaving, I almost drove away with my drink on top of my car (put it there while I put some stuff in the car and forgot about it) and he rushed outside to prevent me from spilling it all over and making a mess of my car. Thanks!

Anyways, I'm going back again for lunch today, and I suggest you try it out sometime. It's definitely one of the best deals around for food, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"My friends and I are on a road trip from Sacramento, CA to Austin, TX and wanted good subs. When we opened them in the car we saw that there was barely any meat on the sandwiches and all the pickles were pretty disgusting.  We do not understand why this place has such a great rating....we do not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"I frequent the steves location on main and power quite often and always get chipotle mayo with my sandwich. I went to this location today and ordered my sandwich with chipotle mayo like normal. The girl at the register took my order and I paid. All is well.  While waiting for my sandwich I hear the guy making it tell the girl \"uh.. We don't have chipotle mayo\", and they both laugh. So they call me when my orders ready and the girl gives me my sandwich but doesn't mention that they don't have my mayo, or apologize or anything. I figured it wasn't that big of a deal and just didn't mention anything. So I get home and start eating my sandwich and realize that there is hardly any jalape√±os or pickles on it, which I paid extra for both. 

The sandwich was decent, but staff was unfriendly and kinda rude, the veggies I paid extra for were skimpy, and they didn't even bother to tell me that they didn't have the mayo that I had ordered. I won't be going there anymore, Ned's is close enough and always has excellent service and perfect samiches. Choose Ned's over this Steve's! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I can't really explain it, but this place has the best sub around and is one of the least spendy. The bread is always soft and fresh and the service is always speedy and friendly. Although there are a few Krazy Subs, it's not a chain. Great local subshop."}
{"text":"Been going here since my high school days...love it, never gets old. There bread is always fresh. Just a good sandwich overall"}
{"text":"Always consistent subs!  Like supporting those non-national sub shops.  Been a staple in Mesa for years."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the reviews!  This place is not anything special.  Bread and meat, and my bread was stale.  I wish there were better places in this area for lunch!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday  based on the yelp reviews It  is a clean little sandwich shop and if you work in the hood its not a bad place to go but i did not think my club sub was that spectacular but the prices are reasonable and the owners take pride in there opperation."}
{"text":"I am so tired of Subway, so a couple of weeks ago I started looking on Yelp for other sandwich places. Last week, I visited Steve's Crazy Sub.  It isn't that far a drive from work for me and I was in the mood for a real submarine. I ordered the 12 inch Super Sub with ham, hard salami, capacolla, pastrami, turkey, provolone cheese with the works, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, vinegar/oil and yellow mustard.  All for $6.05 plus tax.  

Taking the sub to go, I drove to a local park.  Sitting in the shade of the picnic area, I opened up the white paper wrapper and took in the Super Sub vista.  It looked so good and tasted even better.  

It was so good, that later in the week I went back and ate another Super Sub just to check if they made them tasty every time. They do and I will be back to try out the other subs on the menu."}
{"text":"Been coming to this sandwich shop for years. Best cold sub sandwich around. I like the turkey club the best. I've tried to make the same sandwich at home and it never turns out nearly as good. This place just has the best subs."}
{"text":"Service was nonexistent and the sub was horrible. Tiny tomato slices and cheap deli meats that had hard veins running through it. Tried to try a local establishment rather than the chains. Super disappointed. All you could hear was employees talking in the back while the place was dirty and no one even cared."}
{"text":"Restaurant/Ambiance: Small submarine/hoagie sandwich shop (approx 8 or 10 tables)in a strip-mall. Has a mom n pop feel to it. Relatively clean and well maintained. Typical patrons are locals (20's to 60's, blue collar) on lunch break. No problem getting a table or parking. They have a pair of retro arcade games in the back.

Food: They serve all the typical subs; grilled chicken, meatball, salami, veggie, tuna etc. Approximately 15 in total, in 8in or 12 in sizes. The meats and veggies are fresh but as other reviews have stated the bread is rather.....\"generically plain\". Not stale, not bad tasting, just rather plain. Something you might find at a catered party. Nothing bad but not particularly tasty. Toppings are your standard lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard.

Price: most 8 in subs are in the 5-6 dollar range. 

Overall:  A nice little no frills sandwich shop if you happen to be in the area. I feel you might get a better sub at Subway BUT I always support local mom n' pop shops when I can."}
{"text":"A small sandwich shop that seems to be owned by locals and one of the reasons why I stopped by. 

I love sandwiches and this was a normal taste nothing out of the ordinary. They have 3 different sizes of subs and I got the foot long turkey/provolone on wheat. The bread was soft and tasted fresh, but it was normal bread nothing fancy about it. They do the basic toppings and have a few additional toppings to pick from. All the veggies tasted really good and they were fresh. I also added avocado to mine for a $1 more (not bad) and let me tell you they sure were not stingy with it which was my favorite part! The turkey meat had a good taste. The sandwich also came with pickle on the side which is a nice add. 
The shop itself is small and clean with 2 older arcade machines in the back. 
The people that helped me were nice and patient with me especially because it was my first time there. 
Just moved to the area and I'll definitely go back to try the other sandwiches. OH and you can order on grub hub for delivery which is a plus :)"}
{"text":"This cute, locally owned sub shop is a great place to get a tasty sub. I have gone to this location a few times and it is aways clean and well cared for. Your sandwich is always served with a pickle spear and they have lunch and dinner specials. 

They support local softball leagues and the ASU Sun Devils. So there are pictures of all the teams they sponsor and of course, you can purchase a Krazy t-shirt with the ASU colors and fun sayings. All the locations I have been to, are just as pleasant, but this is the only one where I met the owner as he was working there. He was really nice and I enjoy the food/atmosphere even more now.

Try it out, you'll like it."}
{"text":"We were out at Fitch Fields this week and were stuck there the whole day. No way we were going to brave the indigestion of concession foods at the fields. Microwave hotdogs give me heartburn just thinking about it. So, I took off looking around for something close by to pick up for lunch. I suspected it would be a sandwich shop.

About a block and a half away was this spot. Perfect, I thought. So, I ventured in and looked at the menu. The prices looked good, the sandwich choices looked more creative than Subway (which I found out is a block from this place), and there were people in there enjoying their sandwiches. It must be ok. Me without my yelp.... a little like a fish out of water, but we will go on instinct. 

I ordered a foot long Torpedo sandwich (ham, salami, and capacolla and turkey I think). A little cheese, some veggies, extra peppers, mayo mustard. It was really a good price, just over $6. 

When I got the sandwich, I swear it was over 12\". The bread was fresh, the meat a little more generous than subway, and all the veggies fresh and abundant. 

The sandwich was great, the service fast and the people were quite nice. Thanks for the break from the chain."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here.  The poor boy is always good.  My daughter had me try a roast beef with bacon. Yum!  The bread may not be fancy but has a great flavor.  A family favorite."}
{"text":"One of the best subs I've ever had. Bread is so fresh and delicious. Perfect amount of turkey/cheese and condiments. Just enough oil and vinegar to add flavor without dripping everywhere or making the bread soggy. Crunchy pickle. Definitely will be back (probably too frequently as it's across the street and I never knew )"}
{"text":"mesa classic good size sandwich reasonable priced clean inside and employees are nice"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Got an 8in BLT and it was mostly bread with a couple slices of thin bacon, shredded lettuce and very small thin tomatoes. My mother ordered a hot dog and it was microwaved. Bread and all and as bread does in a microwave it gets hard and rubbery."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this small sandwich shop while waiting on a friend.  I ordered a 'pizza boat' pepperoni, sauce covered with cheese on a sandwich roll. Simple and sounds good and maybe it would have been if they had toasted it.
But it was just put in the microwave so it came out hot but the bread was soft and chewy, not great..Too bad"}
{"text":"Good sandwich!  Didn't take long for them to serve it up and much closer to a good sub than subway."}
{"text":"Although the poorboy is decent we all know the staff isn't the best. They tend to slap everything on to the subs and push you out as quickly as possible. My boyfriend and I used to eat there about once a week (since it was in walking distance and saved gas) but we finally decided the tough thick bread and rude customer service was enough. Also the whole not being open on Sunday thing was a huge crock. ):"}
{"text":"This is a small family owned sub shop that's been in the same plaza in this older part of Mesa for over 30 years. This is the original but they've since expanded all over Mesa. You'll find them tucked next to the Dirty Drummer bar on the corner in the same plaza as Wendy's. It can be hard to spot if you're not looking for it. 

They have brightly colored booth seating right when you enter. A few feet back is the counter to order. Depending on what time of day, you'll either see the owner working, his family, or your typical high school kids.

I've always enjoyed their subs, whether it was as a young child or on lunch break long ago in high school. What I enjoy most is their meat selection and the fact that they have a generous helping of not too tart italian dressing and mayo on their subs. The combination is hard to describe but when it's done right, it tastes unlike any other sub.Their bread is soft and fluffy and they leave out the million and a half vegetables you'll get at other places, making it a true sandwich- not just a bunch of vegetables on bread. You can get your sandwich hot or cold and they have reasonably priced lunch specials btwn. 10 AM - 2 PM where you can get an 8 or 12 inch sub, drink, chips or pickle for between $4.63 - $5.23  They also do catering.

Personally I think the Poorboy is one of the best with Salami, Spiced Ham, Bologna, & Provolone Cheese. I would never think of putting those meats together, let alone eat them by themselves, but for some reason they make it work. I love Krazy Sub :)"}
{"text":"steve's krazy subs is a great sub shop! nice selection. i love their bread. always take care of my and my staff when we come in.  very warm and friendly staff."}
