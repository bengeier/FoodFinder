{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and had the 10 course meal. It's a lot of food but we loved every course. I do not love fish but the artful way that the chef's prepare everything is amazing. My favorite dish was the eel. The chef's unique presentation, where else can you find pine cones as a base for your dish, was whimsical but also brought the food together. Although the food is french, they have a decidedly Quebecois flair to the food as well. The wait staff makes you feel like you are one of the family. If you are able to, we highly recommend sitting at the chef's counter. Not only do you get to speak with the chef's about their creations but you can watch the magic come together."}
{"text":"Un nouveau restaurant prometteur, mais au final assez décevant. Le carte est assez classique et n'invite pas à la rêverie ou à l'enthousiasme. Les assiettes sont particulièrement soignées, mais la dégustation n'est pas à la hauteur du tableau présenté.  L'entrée de champignon est très bonne, le thon est agréable, le canard assez ordinaire, voire décevant avec ses accompagnements froids. Les desserts manquent de finesse et d'unité, notamment celui autour du chocolat. La carte des vins enfin demanderait d'être plus étoffée et plus variée. Bref, un restaurant plein de promesses, mais au final assez ordinaire, où l'on est sûr de ne pas revenir une seconde fois."}
{"text":"Tried the 6 services menu. Presentation is great and food is very tastefull. I did not love the fact that the place is in the basement of the building and it is pretty noisy..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Sad attempt at fine dining. Forgot dishes, poor service, nearly inedible food. If you're a vegetarian expect to watch your partner eat because they haven't figured out how to do 7 courses without meat. No part of this meal was enjoyable. Expensive, I feel like I was robbed. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Very impressive and I think it was way beyond my expectation. The location is actually in the lower ground floor so we had a little trouble finding it when we arrived at night, the interior is small but neat. Service was very friendly and the chef even came out to chat and ask if we like the food during the night. We had the chef choice tasting menu, every dish was flavorful and presented in a nice presentation with special plate. Amazing! I would definitely come back again when I visit Montreal in the future!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est très bonne, une belle expérience culinaire. L'endroit est chaleureux et sympathique. Par contre, le service est un peu ordinaire, voir garoché. Quand je paie ce prix là au restaurant je m'attends à un service très attentionné et je ne l'ai pas eu. Mes copines n'ont pas aimé le 3ème plat et le serveur n'a jamais demandé si c'était à notre goût. L'idée n'étant pas de chialer mais de faire une remarque constructives. Le serveur m'a resservit un verre de vin sans me demander si je voulais reprendre un verre du même vin. A 12$ le verre, j'aimerais qu'on me le demande et qu'on ne prenne pas pour acquis mes choix. Donc en gros. L'expérience culinaire vaut le détour mais l'expérience globale laisse elle sur notre faim."}
{"text":"Potato. I collectively ate 1 potato. I can't recall if there was meat, but I vividly remember all of the potato. So. Much. Potato."}
{"text":"Visited for new year's eve for a $108 tasting menu. Atmosphere and service was good. Food was mostly good with some dishes very good like the bacon filled waffle and others not much taste like the calf sweetbread. Some dishes although tasty, in my opinion were off season like the icy shrimp which would be more suited for summer. But that's the chef pick so I guess there's some good intentions behind it. Wine suggestions were good. Our table was next to a wall that had serious insulation issues, we had a steady stream of cool air directly on us and our food. I have always hated eating while worrying my dish is getting cold. Most dishes were cold or temperature so I guess that was not a big deal here but still pretty annoying. I intended to give it three stars but the rest of my party agreed it was more like a four, so four it is."}
{"text":"This was our last dinner on our vacation in Montreal. From the relaxed atmosphere, to the friendly staff, to the yummy amusebouche, we felt welcome from the start.  We did the 8 course \"choosing is missing out on the rest\"  prix fix menu.   Every course was great. But, the lamb and scallops were really perfect. The staff was fun and casual. The owner even took shots with us! We went to some good spots while in Montreal (Joe Beef, Toque)...this one was well above for overall experience and a bargain for what you get. Thanks to the staff and owner."}
{"text":"We had the five-course tasting menu with wine pairings. The menu was relatively creative, the staff enthusiastic, and we were particularly impressed with desert. However, the wine pairings came as such small pours that it was difficult to taste them at all, which was very frustrating as they cost as much as the menu. It's therefore hard to give the restaurant a high rating for value for money."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Le menu est classique mais l execution est tres originale. L entree foie gras praline et bergamote est exceotionnelle. Le service est professionnel et le restaurant est tres bien decore. Strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was, without hesitation, one of the most spectacular meals of my lifetime. The young head chef and his entire team were BEYOND amazing.  We did the 10 course tasting menu and I have rarely had such exquisite flavors that were perfectly paired. From the Mousse Bouche to Elk, Shrimp and Sea bass... it's all wonderful.  This Chef will surely be one of the next big names in the culinary world.  Well done team.  Best.Meal.All.Year  Splurge and eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"After a quick flight from the US, we landed checked in to our hotel and headed out to find this gem of a restaurant.  The cocktails that my wife and I had were possibly the best cocktails we have ever had.  The Lucifer was sweet, but not too sweet, with just the right mix of ingredients.  The bartender clearly knows what he is doing!  The menu which changes every six weeks or so, is limited in options, but the two appetizers, Scallops and Foie Gras were amazing.  The main courses of Lobster and Duck were fantastic.  My chocolate dessert was sweet while my wife's was a bit more savory.  Overall for a fine dining experience this restaurant has better food than restaurants at twice or three times the price."}
