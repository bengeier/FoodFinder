{"text":"I'm dazzled with the coffee and pastries. As good as Paris    Shipped in on Wed Sat and sun from LaGourmadine. Great friendly staff. Only outdoor seating. Used to be a Starbucks girl.    Used to be!!!!"}
{"text":"It's the only place to have coffee in Sewickley Pennsylvania. Frank is a great proprietor. It is fun with great quality coffee. And oh so not a corporate coffee chain."}
{"text":"Tiger spice Chai? Fair trade espresso? I'm in love. I'm a very picky coffee gal and this rivals my hometown favorite. The owner is also super friendly which wins mega points. Didn't get a chance to try any food but it looked scrumptious. Tons of no bs power bars to boot. This place is a win!"}
{"text":"This place is not only the best coffee joint in Sewickley, but also a lovely community staple. Every morning I grab a cup of coffee with my dog Jackson, and we are greeted with Franks warm smile and great conversation. Not only do I get a treat (deliciously crafted coffee) but Jackson fills his belly with a rapid fire of treats. Adesso provides great coffee and because of their incredibly warm staff, is wonderful expierence every time. Franks contribution to building a wonderful community through coffee, treats and friendship is unmatched."}
{"text":"best coffee i've had hands down. the owners are super nice and gave me a complimentary energy bites. i loved the feel of it in there very comfortable feeling in there."}
{"text":"Best local coffee spot. Great owners. I try to make it there on a daily basis. Always greeted with a handshake and a great discussion. Frank and I are solving the worlds problems one coffee bean at a time. Amazing gluten free selections. This place is such a refreshing change from the big chain places."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and the coffee has been delicious every single time. The owner is super friendly too and even remembered my order after only being there once! Love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, gluten free pastry options, and lunch food coming soon!! The only drawback is that there is no seating but it does make sense with the name. 

The man behind the counter was great! Told me that the lunch food should start within two weeks. And he said that La Gourmanadine baked goods comes Wednesday's and Saturday's. I just got a cup of drip coffee but can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop with superb tasting coffee and a great owner!  So much better than the local chain coffee shops!!  Support small business Sewickley!!"}
{"text":"While I normally scoff at Sewickley for being highbrow types, when I find a dope little coffee  shop that isn't Starbucks, I have to show it some recognition. The interior is quite small. It only takes about 4 people for it to start feeling crowded. That aside, it's definitely worth the squeeze. Lots of gluten free snacks and a daily pastry selection. The owner also set out little pastry bite things to samples while he was preparing someone else's order. Once I was up, despite not being a regular, the owner explained the pastry and coffee selections. I went with a Cuban and a pastry called a gourmandise. Glad I did. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"It was my first visit and it was a Saturday. 
I knew they served La Gourmandine pastries but unfortunately they hadn't been delivered yet to the cafe. I liked the interior, it is a small space so it can be confusing who is waiting to order, who is waiting for their order and who is just standing there chatting. I ordered a cappuccino. It was an uncommon flavor that is delicious. I would return just for that unique flavor. It was a bit heavy for a cappuccino, more like a latte but the espresso strength was really good and stood up to all the milk. I'll have to come later in the day to have a chance at a pastry."}
{"text":"I happened to be passing through the area, and decided to stop by Adesso for my daily coffee fix. And so glad I did.

This is a remarkable place, and proves hands down that a small business run with care and passion can provide a product superior in every way to the corporate giants that dot the landscape. The service is excellent, the prices remarkable, and the quality is second to none.

If you live in the area, or are just passing through as I was, put Adesso on your must visit list. You'll have no regrets."}
{"text":"This is just a tiny coffee shop  on a side street in Sewickley, but it is so worth looking for.  The coffee is very good and it's very reasonably priced. There are two coffee flavors everyday and they rotate frequently.  They also have pastries from Mediterra Bakery.   There is no seating.  Must stop in to try this independent coffee shop!!"}
{"text":"It's remarkable how tiny this coffee shop is, but even more remarkable how great their coffee and food are. There's nothing chain about this place, just quality product and friendly service.

The scones are incredible, really gourmet. But wait, there's more. Adesso now serves Millie's ice cream."}
{"text":"Coffee is amazing!  Gluuteny treats!  Custom juices from Salud!  We are so happy to have Adesso Cafe in Sewickley!!!!"}
{"text":"Adesso Cafe serves soul-warmingly good coffee and quality pastries from one of the best French bakeries in town.  The baristas are always friendly.  It's tiny, so there's no place to sit besides the bistro tables outside when it's nice out.  However, that doesn't stop me from blowing through here every so often for a great cuppa and something decadent."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee. Highly recommend the cinnamon scone. Very friendly service. Skip over Starbucks and hit up this lovely local joint."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Sewickley. I haven't stepped foot in Starbucks since finding this place. Try the breakfast pastries. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sewickley is a cute little boutique town plagued with two chain coffee shops. It is about time a good coffee shop came to town.  Yay for Adesso! Adesso serves up a good cuppa with a variety of preparations to choose from.   A limited selection of bakery items were available but I was just in it for the coffee. I had the Cuban coffer which was super.

One word of caution, Adesso is tiny and has no indoor seating.  Not the best spot for a leisurely cup of coffee if the weather is poor."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee shop! I don't write reviews normally, but this place is worth it. This is a great locally owned shop with fantastic service. Unlike most larger chains this place has coffee and espresso which tastes wonderful even without cream or sugar."}
{"text":"This place is a YES.  Skip the corporate giant and treat yourself to a new local business.  My coworker visits Italy every year and she's usually a broken record of complaining about whatever espresso drinks she gets around here.  This place finally shut her up, so that's saying something.  Best cappuccino in Beaver County, comparable to something you'd get in the strip.  Ask them to steam a little sugar in with the milk.  

Fab coffee and espresso drinks, friendly atmosphere and owners, great selection of pastries and snacks to go with your drinks.  Died and went to butter heaven with the scone I'm currently shoving in my face.

 I'll update my review when they get some lunch items, which are coming soon."}
{"text":"Such a lovely little nook coffee shop! Frank is darling and loves dogs! His coffee is great... what a wonderful addition Adesso is to our little town of Sewickley."}
{"text":"Adesso Cafe is a small grab and go that carries many of the food and beverage offerings you would find throughout the Pittsburgh. The coffee comes from Commonplace coffee and the espresso comes from LaPrima Espresso in the Strip District. The inside is very small so it is really designed for grab and go.

Grab and go vegan food is available from Reed and Company in Lawrenceville. Baked goods come from LaGourmandine in Mt Lebanon and from Truly Wize bakery in Greensburg. Truly Wize carries both gluten free and some vegan desserts. Check the box carefully if you have concerns.

The ice cream comes from Millie's in Shadyside however, it is served in small cup containers with a spoon or 4 oz containers. There is no scooped ice cream. Selection was limited since there was a big rush after Memorial Day. They now carry Leona's ice cream from Wilkinsburg.

I have had pretty much all these things on previous visits to these stores and I will admit all of them are very good! Therefore I decided to get the chocolate gluten free vegan cake from Truly Wize bakery. For $3.00 you can't go wrong. The desserts are carefully packaged for take out. Outside there are a few tables and high tops if you want to enjoy your purchase while in the area.

I must admit I loved every bite of this cake and was very pleased with my selection. I love the fact that this little cafe gives a great composite of some of the best coffees, teas, pastries, and food the city has to offer in the Sewickley neighborhood. Located on Walnut St in the town's business district metered street parking is available."}
{"text":"Frank the owner was super warming and friendly! Have a nice long chat with him as he explained his offerings and other recommendations. Our hot and cold lattes were also delicious and smooth! Will definitely be back."}
