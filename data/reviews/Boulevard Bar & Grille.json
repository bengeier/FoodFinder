{"text":"How does a sports bar refuse to put on any other NFL game at 10am besides the Browns game. 10 TV's.... One game.    Reserved seating in the bar for people who won't be there for hours so you can only sit in front of video poker and you have to be playing if you want to sit there.  Rude bartender.   This place will never be an option for me or my friends ever again."}
{"text":"Really good bar food, good variety, lots of pasta dishes and nice pizza pie   Friendly crew  separate smoke free dining   ended up dining here because Southpoint was mobbed for dinner and we been back several times since"}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't found this gem of a spot. Mat was our waiter. What a great waiter with a great sense of humor. The food was amazing. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Las Vegas. First and foremost I am not the biggest Vegas fan, don't care to live here and am beyond terribly homesick for Cleveland.  So I was happy when I discovered there was in fact a \"Cleveland bar/restaurant\" I will say it could be a bit more Cleveland in there, it is sort of a Cleveland/old Vegas hybrid. Of course this is my biased opinion. They have enough Indians, Browns, Ohio state stuff on the walls but could be more. I was once in a Steelers place (cringe) and I don't think the actual city of Pittsburgh was as pro Pittsburgh as that was.  Anyways the food here is really great. Being Italian my self I am overly particular about my sauce. There are few restaurant sauces I'll eat, This one is pretty good though, it passes.  The garlic cheese bread is amazing, the meat balls great. The pork sandwich is really great, actually pretty damn good the next day too. Last time we went my son got the pizza, it was just fare, seemed like a premade crust. The kids do get free ice cream though. As for dessert, the fried dough is very good and the cannoli came looking like it should have its own zip code.  All in all this place is a favorite of mine and until I can do the impossible and convince my L.A. born and raised wife to move to the 216, it will do."}
{"text":"NY STYLE Margherita PIZZA. eat it. Love it. Thank me later. If you're at Southpoint just walk here."}
{"text":"Abosultely love the pepperoni pizza and Ceasar Salad here."}
{"text":"This is a great place for food and football!  We love that they are Browns fans here.  The breakfasts are the best: I love the Italian frittata omelet; it even has artichoke hearts!  Also, the chopped steak with mashed potatoes is to die for.  The servers are very friendly and efficient which adds to the homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can get a terrific meal 7/24 and inexpensively. The menu is very ambitious offering Italian cuisine to old favorite American dishes including a variety of sandwiches. There is no question that the waiters in this restaurant enjoy working there. They always are accommodating, cordial and provide great service. The owner is very recognizable. He is the big guy that helps clear off the tables and doubles as the restaurants personable host. It sure beats the Denny's late-night or early morning breakfast.  Try it, I know you will return and make it one of your favorites."}
{"text":"Pretty good little bar casino. The food was good and a nice sized portion. Friendly staff. The only downside is the cigarette smoke but I guess that is a problem for all non-smokers in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"What a great place.  They have the best pizza in town.  Make sure to try this place!  They also make a great Greek salad.  Would also recommend the cheese sticks."}
{"text":"Very tasty, friendly staff and decently priced. Son had fettuccine Alfredo, wife had eggplant Parmesan and my daughter and I shared a pizza. All were very good.   We plan to go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here for the 6:30am NFL game being played in England.  When this place says they're open 24hrs they are open 24hrs ... bar and full kitchen menu. Very pleasant and interactive staff who accomodated our requests to turn the football volume up and the music down. Great breakfast and bar food. During the course of the game we ate a veggie egg white omelette, french toast, and spicy stuffed peppers. BTW, the french toast is made with ciabatta bread ... really good call."}
{"text":"The service and food was outstanding. We got here about 3:30pm not many people inside but it's early for dinner. A little while later the placed filled up, the menu has a ton of options. The bar and dining area are in sperate areas, which is nice."}
{"text":"Make a right as you enter and seat yourself in the dining room dominated by sport's decor from cleveland (the owner's are from there) and five screens. It's a Sports Bar motif. But quiet and comfortable. Service is more than attentive, it's upbeat and fun.  As a foodie, I know great kitchen work when I see / taste it. The pasta is fresh, the portions generous, and the flavors abound. I mean they do not go on-the-cheap on fixin's...quality is there. Yet the daily specials give you some real values. Everything arrives colorful flair. Gotta say it's the best down home fresh-from-the-kitchen experience I've found here since I arrived a few months ago.  (M and Southpoint casino staff discounts)"}
{"text":"This place is very over priced for the quality of food that is served here.  The service is not intended to make the costumer feel at home.  And for get about having a nice couple of drinks for free while betting the MAX they monitor that to the cent.  Cheap Cheap Cheap, being from Cleveland you would think ok mabey one beer for free but nada.  Im not looking for a free ride just some friendly conversation and backing support for a fellow Browns fan.  This place is WAY overpriced and the service is terrible.  Take my advice and eat and drink at the South Point....... Don't waste your time and money!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the Boulevard Bar & Grille for breakfast and we were pleasantly surprised. My husband ordered the breakfast wrap and I ordered an omelet with tomato, spinach, mushroom and ham. It was freshly prepared and looked nice. We brought our leftovers back to the hotel and our friends enjoyed them as much as we did. The bill was reasonably priced. Service was very good. The restaurant itself was very clean. We enjoyed looking at the memorabilia on the walls. We will recommend this place to friends and make return visits."}
{"text":"This will be our new favorite go into pizza place. My husband and I were craving for late night pizza and came across this place thru yelp. Great reviews so we tried it. We ordered NY style pizza through phone and pick it up. The guy who took our order over the phone was really nice. The pizza was great, very flavorful and evenly cooked. I love how crispy the crust was and fresh the veggies were. We'll sure be coming back."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. It is a bar/grill even though  we never have been in the bar section we like the food. It isn't your typical \"bar food\".  Seems like every time we go there for dinner they are packed. Anyway they make an appetizer called stuffed peppers it describes them as banana peppers but they are long and not really hot and they have a slab of italian sausage and mozzarella cheese over them and then served with marinara sauce. Really really love these sometimes thats what I eat for my main course. We have had the pizza, burgers and chicken parm prevoiusly. I cant remember what else. I like going to restaurants that are unique in their menu and this one of those places yum. They run specials also."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I will definitely be back! The service was great and the white pizza under the specialties was amazing! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow, so disappointed.   Came here because I heard such positive reviews.   Really poor service."}
{"text":"Usually prompt service with excellent pizza and chick parm. there are two dining areas and a seperate bar area. I would recommend this place any day. The breakfast food it really good too!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good pizza in the area this is the spot to go! I also has Bbq sliders and hot stuffed peppers, both were very good. Most local bars fall short when it comes to food, but not this place!"}
{"text":"Unless you're an Ohio fan don't bother with this place for food. Service and prices were good but food was terrible."}
{"text":"We LOVED The Boulevard!  My husband had the fish and chips - FANTASTIC (I tasted it)!  I had the chicken parmesan sandwich - perfectly seasoned!  Yummy cole slaw.  We liked it so much, we went back for breakfast the next day and had delicious omelets.  Like I told the owner, Flory, GREAT food and GREAT hospitality!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, friendly staff. Dark environment, took a long time for my eyes to adjust. Prices were much better than casinos across the street."}
{"text":"great food price was decent aswell I look forward to this hidden gem every year. The Chop steak was great"}
{"text":"Full Italian menu 24/7, and it's GOOD. The pasta sauce keeps you daydreaming about it for days. Best chicken parm in town. Service is fast, prices are fair. This is an excellent place to go for a late night meal after a show across the street at South Point Casino. No lines, and the food is far better than the South Point cafe."}
{"text":"We waited much too long after we sat down ( you seat yourself) and we watched 3 workers look up at us and watch us sit down. The food took awhile and was not that good AND there was a discrepancy on the bill. Definitely wouldn't go back.   Oh AND it was super sketchy at the front it said ring doorbell when doors are locked...."}
{"text":"Great service. Outstanding pizza! (Love the crust!) Good prices. Right across the street from the South Point.  This Cleveland-based and themed sports bar and restaurant has a great menu.   This time, I ordered a white - ricotta pizza and added spinach and artichokes! Truly wonderful.   The bar (smoking) is separate from the dining room (non-smoking). But both have multiple big-screen TVs, which is either a plus or minus depending on what you're looking for.  Definitely worth checking out when you're in this part of town."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good spot for my son and I after the movies, and read the previous reviews, so decided to stop by.  Had a fantastic dinner!  The atmosphere was nice, the service was amazing, and the food was top notch!  One of the owners stopped by our table to check on us, and chatted a bit about food from the Midwest and their menu.  Was nice to see some personal investment into the guest experience.  I was kinda surprised to see that Yelp reviewers had noted that this place was not good for kids.  I was pretty sure they had a family dining room, so I called ahead.  This place is great for kids and families.  We plan to bring our whole clan back for pizza and finger foods!  I noted a \"yes\" in my Yelp check-in...hopefully that changes over.  Would hate to see other families miss out a this spot due to bad information.  Definitely a great local spot that we plan to frequent regularly!"}
{"text":"I don't know what else to start with other than the staff are the most kind and most amazing people I have ever come across. For the OSUvUM game, every seat in the restaurant and bar was reserved. My dad had been waiting weeks and got up four hours before the game to get a good seat. When we walked in, he was devastated. The staff and managers worked quickly to acquire two tables and chairs from outside so we could watch the game and we are forever grateful.   The food, as expected, is also to die for! I've been to Chicago, Manhattan and many other iconic food destinations and I have never in my life had \"NYC pizza\" east of the Mississippi that tastes like it belongs in the big apple.   The atmosphere, the staff and the food come together for the epitome of a Holy Trinity and will keep me coming back all the way from Utah for years."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this joint. The bar staff is awesome and extremely cool. Every time I go they comp my meal from my gambling and the food isn't your typical bar food - this is a top notch Italian meal!! The house salad with their creamy Italian dressing is my absolute favorite. You wont be disappointed, I promise."}
{"text":"Much better Food than across the street , where we were staying . The cheese burger was very good . The Fries were cooked to perfection .Had a slice of my friends Pizza , and that was excellent as well. The Price was reasonable . Staff was very attentive .  Next time at southpoint  , I will be returning !!'"}
{"text":"They claim to be a Cleveland Browns bar, yet don't even have the audio on.  They have the audio from that ridiculous red zone channel, which makes it difficult to follow any game.  I'm never going back...went to Kopper Keg West instead.  Browns on every TV with AUDIO!"}
{"text":"Mediocre lasagna and ok service.  Just because you are in Vegas doesn't mean that you are catering to the McDonalds crowd.  The lasagna sauce was sweet and even a ton of salt couldn't kill that sweetness.  When I cut into my small piece of lasagna, it was dry inside, very dry.  While I give them kudos because it was obviously made in-house, I expected to have my socks knocked off for a $20 piece of pasta.  Our group were barely able to squeeze into the small space they allocated for us and that set us up for a hot, loud time.  It wasn't a memorable time or food, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is good and not over priced. It's quiet. The staff is friendly and attentive. The chopped steak and fried dough are my fav! Even my kids ask to go here."}
{"text":"I have been here so so many times so just some thoughts. First on the specials menu they have a 5$ Steak and Egg special. It does not say on the Menu but it starts at 9 AM in the morning. Sort of strange for a 24 hour place. The Pizzas are great, both the Tomato Sauce and the Roasted Garlic Tomato Sauce are great. The burgers are also great and a half pound.  There are two sides to this restaurant the Bar is smoking and the dining area is non smoking. Its across the street from the South Point Hotel."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar, average food and service.  It is clean and well kept. Good place for a drink and to watch one of the many televisions.  The Supreme pizza we had could have used some improvement,  the crust on the pizza was good but it did not have any tomato sauce and the pepperoni was oily and didn't have a lot of taste to it, this made for a pretty bland pizza."}
{"text":"Blvd Bar and Grill is awesome! Service is top notch! I love seeing the owner out working beside his staff and mingling with customers! The food was fantastic! Love the separate bar/smoking to restaurant separated by glass! Joins both rooms! Fun crowd! Sports for all!"}
{"text":"After being in a number of times for drinks and food, both of which are awesome. It seems like they have just about all the bases covered for a local bar. I guess I'd like to see a pool table or something but that's me being picky. It's pretty cool in the dining area, they have a bunch of vintage pics of vegas. I like that. Don't forget to tip your bartender!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Grandview across the street and enjoyed this place for dinner twice! For one thing, it's good food for affordable prices, plus you get 10% off if you're staying at grandview... we liked the local IPA \"dirty dog\" and all staff we talked with were very nice! White balsamic dressing was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Las Vegas for over 2 years you find your little neighborhood bars and restaurants that become \"your place\". The Boulevard was one of my favorite places to come have a drink, play some video poker, and enjoy some delicious Italian food. Since Vegas is a smoking friendly city, the bar is completely separate from the dining area which is smoke free. You can eat up at the bar if you prefer as well.  The food is great and moderately priced. They have an excellent hand tossed pizza. I'm quite picky with my pizza and was pleasantly surprised. My favorite is their white pizza with a garlic and olive oil base. If you come on a Friday you must try their clam chowder. It's made from scratch and is probably one of the best I've had and that's including my trips to the east coast.   If you're in to sports, they have you covered with many TV's showing the games throughout the bar and even in the restaurant area. The owners are from Ohio and have all the Ohio sports team memorabilia displayed throughout the bar and restaurant (only downside being originally from Michigan!)    The Boulevard is open 24 hours and after midnight most of the food is 50% off. Breakfast is good here as well. It's right across from the South Point casino and the Grand View timeshares so it can get pretty busy here, although I've never had to wait to be seated. The bartenders and wait staff have always been friendly and quick.   The Boulevard is a fun and affordable place and I make it here every time I visit Vegas for the pizza and soup. Definitely worth the drive down the Strip."}
{"text":"Don't go for Browns game!!! Go to tap house on Charleston or Kopper Keg on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday to watch some college football. The owner tells me that all tv's will only show Ohio state. What is this?  We are in Nevada. Ok so I assume he is from Ohio. But seriously?  You lost my business!"}
{"text":"Love this bar, and the service is phenomenal. My favorite it Brandi the bartender who never lets your drink go empty!!! I will recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I came here super late night by myself after a business seminar I attended. I ordered a cocktail and the burger, which was suggested by the bartender. The burger was really good and the service was really good considering the amount of people there at that time of night. There were some other good looking menu items that I would definitely try if I go back."}
{"text":"OVerall it was a good night a group of us from our LV office came here for dinner.  At first, I didn't want to come here because a big sign said \"Smoker Friendly:, and I dread smelling smoke and smelling like smoke. That would've been a big strike and one star lost for me.  But strike one never happened.  When we got there at 7 PM, we were the only ones in the smoker friendly patio with no one smoking. The hot sun was setting and the comfy shaded patio was great for post meeting gabbing.    We had just come from South Point casino, and saw some gorgeous ladies serving drinks at the casino.  Here though, you have two regular guys in T shirts serving drinks.  That might've been strike two, but strike two never happened. What they lacked in beauty and finesse, they made up for with their very good service. We started off with some drinks - their 6 beers on tap included Sam Adams, Bud, Bud Light, an ale, and Hefewiezen.  This wheat beer was smooth and citrusy, and went well with the crispy Calamari in beer batter and antipasto type appetitizer someone ordered with sausage, cheese, and marinated veggies.  We went inside to have dinner.  It was comfy in the front section where we were with minimalist decor. As a group, we had a limted menu to keep things simple. We had a choice of sirloin steak cut thick, chicken Marsala - which is what I had, a pork, and shrimp fettucine.  The Marsala was delicate, slightly salty, with a light brown sauce surrounding tender pieces of chicken.  The steak was beautifully and correctly cooked, but slightly dry and probably could've used a dry rub.  It came with a baked potato and veggies.  No one in my table had the other two dishes.    The spaghetti that came with the chicken dish was also beautifully presented, but I didn't care for the bland flavor.  IMO, it could've used more Italian seasonings like oregano, rosemary, thyme, and garlic.  That was almost strike three.  But the simple salad and warm bread along with the good entree prevented that.  And, after I tasted their tiramisu and heard about their creme brulle, that someone else ordered, my palate waked up...unlike our brains which by this time, was ready for a night cap after a 5 minute walk across the street to the hotel.  The multiple strikes and star losses never happened, and overall though the spaghetti was a miss - the service, dessert, chicken marsala was very good.  I'd give it 3.5 stars rounded up."}
{"text":"It was good, just OK. But I would definitely go back. Servers were friendly, if you want to eat something other than fine cuisine and eat for less $$ this is the place to go. It was great to go to being from Ohio. The only issue we had was the bar area was too small for all the customers that were there, and it was slow to get service when we went back again. We just had a drink when we finally got served then went elsewhere to eat. But all in all it was OK."}
{"text":"The food is great. In town for a visit and stumbled upon this Ohio State/Cleveland Browns/Cleveland Cavs bar. The decor is decked out in All Ohio banners. The food was really good. I came in back to back nights. I had the wedding soup which was home made and outstanding. I also had the veal Parmesan and it was awesome. The service and amp sphere was very personable and friendly."}
{"text":"Super nice bartenders and definitely the best Pizza in town!!  They have good salads and sandwiches (love the Talipia) but the Pizza is best!  My favorite is always no cheeze and all the veggies!"}
{"text":"Nobody standing around asking for drinks. Empty tables and bar stools but they are \"too busy\" to bring food to the table in the bar. There are three tables in the bar and me and my gf are the only ones at one. People at the actual bar are eating so what is keeping them from being able to bring food to us? Maybe just a lazy bartender. Oh well will finish my drink and leave.. To bad. Missed out on a lot of money from drink and food sales. Not that it hurts you anyway. Good job boulevard bar and grille. Five stars for customer service...... On a scale from 1 to 100."}
{"text":"Have ordered four large (27+) take out orders over the past 3 weeks. Food has always been spot on and on time and delicious. Boulevard has been very accommodating, and there have been no issues, which is rare for such large orders.   They have made my life very easy!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and service! We went here three years ago then again this week and it was just as amazing both times. We have ate out all week at other places and everyone agrees this has been the best food and Sevice."}
{"text":"I was referred to here by a friend. I don't go to bars because I don't drink. He said the food was good. Sausage peppers and onion sandwich is amazing. The place does not filter out the cigarette smoke and is very smoky. I was very disappointed they wouldn't let me smoke my cigar as the cigarette smoke was killing me. Discrimination against cigar smokers. For that reason I will not be back. Service was great, food very good."}
{"text":"great service always. owners really care about their business & it shows."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna and my wife had angel hair pasta with tomatoes, bacon and basil. Not only was the food fantastic but we brought home enough leftovers for dinner tomorrow. You will leave feeling very full. They make their own salad dressings and they were way better than the usual fare.  Prices were reasonable, great staff and the owner sat and talked with us for a while (we're all expat Clevelanders). Every night they have a special and tonight's was all-you-can-eat pasta, which suited the huge two family party next to us. We hear the all-you-can-eat fish fry on Fridays is packed."}
{"text":"As far as local dive bars go, solid choice.   I tend to judge everything by the quality of their Caesar salad... This place has a pretty solid Shrimp Caesar salad. Shrimp cocktail, should be more al dente but in a salad, grilled shrimp should have some Grill on them. But the Romain, fresh. Not a fan of pawning off provolone as parmesan but the lettuce was that clean and the dressing smooth and evenly coated.  I just remembered the red wine, flat. I wanted to go four stars and since there aren't 3.5...three  However, the servers and bartenders, excellent people. The kind of casual, welcoming personalities that you hope to find when you sneak into your local dive."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place with terrific food. Nice staff. Right across street from South Point."}
{"text":"Oscar and I frequent The Blvd Bar, We love this place all the bartenders are so awesome!! BRANDY, STACEY, JENN, AND JACK  are the very best!"}
{"text":"Soooooo, long story short, my co-workers and I came here after work around 2am Sunday morning. I walked in and everyone had drinks and had already been served. There were 3 other guests other than our group of 10. I ordered my drink and then asked for a food menu. When I asked what the bartender recommended that was flavorful he said \"I'm not going to do your job, read the menu and let me know what you want.\"  Yup, the bartender made zero recommendation, was rude and made sure that I wouldn't be coming back. Even worse, we all work in the customer service industry nearby and guess who won't be sending them any business and guess who will scream at the top of my lungs to make sure our next gathering is at a bar with someone who would actually like to be kind and enjoy a good tip.  NEVER have I had an experience like this before. My coworkers who frequent the bar said he is their least favorite bartender and he often makes mistakes. Needless to say I closed my tab and called it an early night. Jack killed my vibe and the potential for his own pockets to be fatter. Too bad, so sad."}
{"text":"Kind of old but big screen TVs and friendly staff. the marguerita pizza is worth the trip alone. Seriously"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time on Oct 3, 2016.  We had a group of 12 and we all enjoyed the food so much that we went back the next night.  The food was awesome and the service was great.  Our server really made us feel like family.  Thank you Neesa!!  Our trips to Vegas will now always include dinner here at the Boulevard bar and grill!!"}
{"text":"We are out of town visitors and decided to stop here with a Party of six on Friday evening, August 19th at about 10pm.  We were not sure what to expect before we entered; however, were pleasantly surprised by our entire experience.  We seated ourselves in the main dining area.  The server we had (I forgot her name) was so wonderfully pleasant, upbeat, kind, friendly -- just an awesome person!  Speaking for two out of the six, we took her suggestions and tried the Meatball Sandwich and the Charbroiled Chicken Sandwich.  For the side, we tried the canjun fries with the blue cheese. Her suggestions were spot on.   That food was some of the best bar/pub/restaurant food I have had in a long time.  Kudos to the entire staff behind the scenes, for preparing an excellent meal.   Even the owner (or possibly manager) came around and checked on tables himself to see how things were going.  If I was a local, I would go here quite often.  I will certainly return again as a guest, as we do visit Vegas three times a year."}
{"text":"I think I've finally found my new local spot! I have absolutely no idea how in the over 9 months that I've lived around the corner from Boulevard Bar & Grille...I had never been there until last night! I was craving casual Italian that wouldn't break the bank and my Google steered me to Boulevard.  I'm so glad it did! I was promptly greeted by the really sweet bartender (I don't remember her name! :-( ) I ordered a Pyramid Hefe to begin with and proceeded to order penne pasta + shrimp tossed in lemon wine sauce - added spinach.  The bartender also brought out a basket of bread and butter for me :-) The pasta was honestly excellent! I ordered an IPA as well that was delicious. I then received a text from a friend who was about to be at my house and I had to head home - the bartender brought me the cannoli I ordered for dessert, the check, and to-go boxes very quickly and I was out the door in no time! I ate the cannoli back home and it was DELICIOUS! Finished the whole damn thing. Overall, loved the vibe too.  Just a great spot to chill, catch some games, talk to the bartenders, etc.  There seemed to be a few other regulars...I can't wait to become one as well!"}
{"text":"As long as I can reminder during football season, this bar is a Cleveland Browns and Ohio State bar. The gaming area does haves the standard cigarette smoking smell as any other 24hr establishment in town. The bartenders make the drinks fast and are very friendly. I can tell because many of them have a local following who come in frequently and gossip.   The pastas here are decent as well as the steak and eggs dinner. Sometimes I order the jalapeño poppers which they make very well. If I have any complaint from this place it is that a friend and I have ordered a side salad here a couple times and notice they load it with way too much salad dressing. Other than that it's great for locals who live in the south/southwest side of town."}
{"text":"My husband and I stop at the Blvd Bar and Grille each time we visit Vegas.   They serve the freshest and finest ingredients in all their food!   Excellent wait staff, casual dining at affordable prices, delicious American and Italian food!   Far better than most places you will dine on the strip/   And without all the hassle of fighting the traffic and having to walk which seems for miles!         We enjoyed another lovely meal on Tuesday, and again on Thursday this week! The food was wonderful, generous portions and FRESH!   they do not disappointed!   The owner is very friendly and hands on.   Always open, 24/7!  Convent parking and a great place to relax and enjoy the game.  Located just across the street from the South Point Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times with my family. The food is always great and the portions are huge. Try the Boulevard Steak sandwich. The owner walks around to every table to all how things are and makes friendly conversation. Customer service at its finest! I bought a home across the street and my family and I will become regular customers. We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"We're staying at the GrandView next door to South Point and had been cooking in our unit and driving to various places for meals.   We couldn't find the barbecue place we wanted and ended up trying Boulevard Bar & Grille as a last resort, mainly because it looked kind of dull on the outside. We didn't expect much at all.  But inside it was super clean with smoke-free air and lots of big screen TVs. There's a Cleveland sports bar theme and the members of our party who live in that area recognized several Cleveland high school pennants on the wall.    Our party ordered two of the pizzas, the pork ribs, a salad, and a couple of desserts to eat and beer and cider to drink. Our server told us the pizzas would take an additional 20 minutes to cook and would we mind waiting? We said no problem -- as it was nice to know of the delay before we completed our order.  When they arrived the pizzas were incredibly huge, nice and hot. The pizza eaters in our party said there was a good blend of flavors in the sauce and it was just all around good.   The pork ribs were out of this world: the meat just fell off the bone, very tender and not fatty at all. Definitely the best I've had in a long time.  The fries that came with the ribs were crisp and hot and the serving was quite generous.  The salad was a basic dinner salad with a good dressing.   The desserts we ordered included creme brulee, which was extremely well done. The crust on it was perfectly done--I mean, it was PERFECT. Spumoni ice cream was good, too.  We also ordered the homemade fried dough... my god, did that smell good. I didn't eat any but our guests who did said it was nice and hot and tasted divine.  Looking around, we noticed that this place provides live music by local artists and we really wished we were going to be in town for the next event.   Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and most efficient. I always check out the bathrooms (because I think their condition is a good indicator of the cleanliness of the kitchen) and they were ultra clean.   Overall, this was the best meal I'd had in our couple of days here in Vegas and I would definitely go again, definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but don't let it fool you, the food is incredible!!!"}
{"text":"This is locally owned which is always a plus for me.  They have a pretty decent menu for a local bar - most \"pub\" type places around here have pretty much the same menu but Boulevard goes above and gives better choices.  The staff is nice but hella slow.  No one is in any rush to get you anything.  If you're just out for a relaxing lunch or to watch a game and don't mind slower service its worth it.  If you have somewhere to be afterward, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"This place has the best food. Kudos to the chef. Try their pizza. It's amazing. Very friendly atmosphere. The employees are wonderful."}
{"text":"I used to live on this side of town but have since moved. I often find myself craving their amazing food though so we often make it over to grab a quick bite to eat. The staff have ALWAYS been absolutely amazing and friendly as well as attentive. On our most recent visit my boyfriend and I ended up there around 11pm on a Tuesday night the female bartender was so kind and funny! The food was fabulous as usual, and the music was SO MUCH FUN! We had a blast gaming at the bar, having dinner and drinks, and quietly singing along to 90's music which had us laughing along with the bartender. The bar was quiet at this point but there was another gentleman enjoying the atmosphere and music choice as well. We had so much fun that night! If you want to have fun, good food, good drinks, and an awesome staff to highlight your experience, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOULEVARD!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast customer service was great even as busy they where. Food had good taste and they cook it to your specific way I wanted."}
{"text":"We stay at South Point which is across the street. Found this place right here on Yelp. Worked out great and we will be back. Good service and great food. Not expensive. TV's to watch sporting events. And bar with slots."}
{"text":"Good food, my family and I enjoyed it! However the staff was very unorganized and scatter-brained. It took forever for our waitress to bring us our bill and we eventually had to walk back to the kitchen after 15 minutes to give it to another staff member. Good food, but the staff needs to have more organization or a plan."}
{"text":"This place is a find  every time I go there they have homemade soup homemade pasta sauce I'm telling you if you get a chance you ow to yourself to go there and try their food and the service is excellent what a great find and just think I live in Summerlin and I go all the way to eat here"}
{"text":"We had a bit of a wait on a Friday night.  When the seven of us were finally seated, we had menus.  Again, a bit of a wait for our server, but she kept apologizing.  After that, the service was pretty spot on.   It was Friday night all you can eat fish fry.  Two of us were getting that.  Everyone ordered.  Our server came out apologizing over and over that there would be a 30 minute wait.  We changed our orders.   It is apparent that everything is fresh made.  We all pretty much cleaned out plates.  One person ordered the tiramisu.  I can honestly say that it was the best that I have ever had. I had penne with shrimp with garlic and tomatoes.  The pasta could have used some salt in the cooking water.  Other than that, it was delicious.  Another diner at our table said the same thing about his spaghetti-that it needed salt. Don't go by the name on the outside.  It is not bar food."}
{"text":"Love this place including the service.  You want delicious fresh tasting food, it's beyond compare.   Recommend the hand tossed pizza for starters.  Return trips guaranteed."}
{"text":"We stayed across the street at South Point with the family. We were looking for a good place to eat before we headed home that had something for all five of us. This place had something for each of us. From salad, wings, pizza and burgers. Great service and great food. If you're with a group of buddies, they have a separate sports bar seating area. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous time enjoying a Friday fish fry. Very reasonable prices for food and drinks. Great location across from Southpoint Casino. Fun atmosphere for Cleveland and Las Vegas fans. Owner came over and talked to us twice. Be also sent us yummy fried dough. Nice guy . ps..best clam chowder and mozzarella. Group of 7 seated with kids immediately."}
{"text":"Good spot to go to if you're in the area and want a good pizza and beer.  I've been in her multiple times since I moved to this side of town and the service is always top notch!   If you visit during happy hour or even evenings they have specific special for most entrees.  I enjoy how layer back it is and how good the service is here.  If you're wanting a local bar that does it right and takes care of you - the blvd. Is your spot!"}
{"text":"I have been here once before and it was ok on my opinion. My husband really liked it so I figured I would try it again.  We walked in tonight and the door to the smoky bar was proped open. So it smelled like cigarettes everywhere. We waited for the hostess for about 5 minutes. She never showed up. We walked out and then sat in our car. While we waited in our car another family walked in and walked out.  I figured I would try again by myself so I went back in to look for the hostess and still couldn't find her. I get that its busy but you have to man your stations. Also,I really think the open door from the bar is a healthcode violation. I won't go back there again after tonight."}
{"text":"We love this local bar/restaurant.  Being from Cleveland and now living here it was wonderful to find a little slice of home.  Speaking of slice the pizza here is one of the best around.  You can get either New York style or regular.  Yes Monday is the pizza special 1/2 which is a great deal.  We have tried just about everything on the menu and have never found something we didn't like.  The entire staff here will make you feel welcome and will always provide you with excellent service.   The restaurant provides \"smoke-free\" dining and the bar offers smokers the opportunity to smoke.  Being a non-smoker myself I have never found the bar to be smoke filled."}
{"text":"I love Boulevard Bar's pasta!   I got 911 for on this place from two old guys from the East coast, who usually stop here after a round of golf.     Located right across on Las Vegas Boulevard from the South Point casino, when you see this place, you have to think.. does this place even serve anything else other than bar food.   Well, I was very surprised they could bring it for Pasta.  I have to say, their Pizza is pretty good, but is the winner at this place is their Capellini aglio olio..   It's a simple dish, but their recipe is hard to beat.     Since it was a quite day at the bar, I got into conversion with one of the owner, and I told them who sent me here, the owner/manager broke out all of their homemade sauces for me to sample/    I was stunned, because my old friends were right...These guys make some of the best  homemade sauces in Las Vegas.     It's not cheap, but not too expensive either.     If you in the area, you might be very surprised what this bar and grill has for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came here for lunch with my mom and was served by a Miss Tammy. She was so delightful and made our experience perfect! Will most definitely be back again!! 10/10 would recommend. Large portions and delicious food. We had the parmesan chicken and chicken sandwiches! Absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"What a delightful find we discovered today.  Clean and orderly facilities are evident as soon as you pull into the parking lot.  As you enter, the daily specials prominently posted catch your eye. Customers seat themselves.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  Menu offered a plethora of choices.  Cost of meal was reasonable. The chef did an excellent job.  Our food was well presented and tasty.  Definitely adding this fine to our repeat list."}
{"text":"A 2:30am check-in certainly indicates that I have insomnia or enjoyed heavy drinking before I arrived here, and I'd lean towards the latter since this is Vegas. Everything at the South Point casino was closed when I finished up, and my friend and I were starving. Enter, Boulevard Bar & Grille.  Surprising, to say the least. I have no idea why I ordered an omelette, but I did. It was really delicious, fluffy, and full of veggies. My friend went with the eggplant parmesan sandwich, and I wished I had ordered that instead. Really, really delicious. For bar food at 3am, this place is excellent. The bartender was wonderful; he offered menu suggestions and was super accommodating. I wish I could remember his name ...   If you're at South Point, there isn't a HUGE selection of wonderful food inside the casino, and this place is simple to walk to. Open late, and the food is still fresh. Can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few times 2/3 times I was very disappointed not the best quality food I've had. I am a vegetarian not that many choices to choose from. Staff is great though."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and we've never once been disappointed. They have great Italian food and fantastic desserts! The bar is nice also, and has gaming. They have a room you can reserve for private parties, and also cater."}
{"text":"Great service, Matt was his name.  Just a chill midwesterner who was on top of the service, communicated great etc.  Pizza was rock solid  for my tastes, but the best was the app of hot banana pepper strips topped with sausage and mozz!  Yeah gym tomorrow.......hard, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here. And I think I can say that the rest of my party of 8 enjoyed themselves also. First of all this bar and restaurant is owned by a couple from Ohio so they had OSU, Browns, Bengalls, and Cavaliers decor covering the walls. Myself and the rest of my party are from Michigan and we even had a UofM alum with us so we were weary. Oddly enough, our server was from MI also! So we had a nice chat about where she was from etc. She was very attentive and friendly. I ordered the \"special\" which on that night was a patty melt and french fries. It was very delicious. Three others shared a pizza which was HUGE and fed an extra person that wandered in later and me the next day. It too was very good. All in all we had a really good experience and it was nice to get out of the casino that we were staying near across the street. No offense South Point!"}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic food, huge portions -- the lasagna is phenomenal!  We were staying at a time share across the street and so glad we did!"}
{"text":"the smoke billowing thru the restaurant was horrible.  they have doors however they were not closed.  the waitress was great.  our bread was delivered cold. we asked for it to be heated.  we just started our soup/salad and our meal was delivered.  it sat and got cold.  they redid the meal.  i will not go back due to the heavy smoke smell, what a way to ruin a great meal"}
{"text":"Horrible service. And I didn't even sit down. I placed an order over the phone and then went to pick it up. Stood at the bar for a least 3min no one ever came over they both just walked past and then when someone did come over they served the ladies who came in after me. I had to go get a manager just to pick up my order. Thank goodness he gave me my calamari free, because it was NOT good. The sauce was hotter than the Calamari.  That sucks too because there literally 3min from my house. I might try them again but I don't know."}
{"text":"So lets start from the beginning. We walked in and were ignored by the bartenders for a solid 5 minutes while we wondered the bar trying to find seats to eat at. Once we sat down though we were informed sharply and insistant that we don't have a server. They placed the menus and silver wear as well as salt and pepper on the bar and stepped away insisting they were coming around but then why wouldn't you just walk with them.   next the menu. nothing special on the menu nothing i really wanted there was a eggplant bruchetta but i am not ordering italian items from a not italian resturaunt (i am a italian i trust the proper food in a bar to be pub food)  Ordred the boulivard steak sandwhich it is supposed to come with rib eye in it. Well it didn't the cut was new york strip. While it was cooked and seasoned well it was not a rib eye and god awefully hard to chew i bit in to the sandwhich and couldnt tear it i chomped on it and tore and broke the bread and lettuce and tomato and never made a dent in the steak.   My father in law got the same experience. We knew it was strip be cause all strip cuts have not only grissle but Tough parts of fat on the edges. Ribeyes dont.  Mother in law got a burger and ordered it medium and came out well done.   wife got chicken tenders and they were stock freezer resturaunt supply fingers. The only thing that came out good my wife like light breaded chicken fingers so 1 point for this place.   We all were half way down our drinks by the time the food came and were not offered refills at all. I finished my drink and got my self the refill. We were not even offered a refill until we were litterally about to leave. my morher in law ordered a teauilla and oj. We tasted the silver tequilla but a oj that was concentrate and very little of it.  check came out to 62.49 i think. But with lousy food and service i don't even tip normally, but i wasn't paying i normally ask for a manager to but i was told to ignore that and write the yelp review. we tipped $6 for the ticket and when we got to the car the waitress followed us out and demanded to answer why we tipped $6 and we only thought. Really? after what we told you and only argued that well we dont get the wrong product in.  we definately won't be coming back in and John Taffer needs to visit this place and raise hell."}
{"text":"So much hype about the food.. ordered 4 things on the menu and not one was good.. wont be coming back here.."}
{"text":"Found out about this place through our uber driver. It's a wonderful place where all the locals goes to. The food is wonderful and so is the service!!! I love the fact that that they make their salad dressing in house, pasta is great and so is the pizza! It's so good, I came bacl a second time while i was in town visiting. l'll be  back for sure when I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food excellent. Service not good. Waited 15 minutes for a drink and it was all fish u can eat. Well my husband waited 20 minutes trying to find a server to get another piece of fish. We gave up and I had to wave my arm in the air and said help for the bill. Really?"}
{"text":"Burger and pizza nights are def worth trying. Some of the better pizza I have had. Breakfast is decent, but nothing exciting. Typical bar breakfast. Haven't tried their pasta, but want to. Service is ok."}
{"text":"It's a bar that serves food.  Decent food.  Service is fine and if you request it they can show the free UFC cards which is what I was going for.  No sound though."}
{"text":"Had a really yummy meal at Boulevard Bar & Grill! I'm sure it will be the first of many. The food was good the menu was diverse and our waitress Tina was great! Very friendly and efficient. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened with my first visit 5 years ago, but I just rediscovered the Boulevard and am loving it!  Granted, the hubs and I have been enjoying the pizza so much we haven't tried anything else as of yet!  So I will update accordingly as we taste more of the menu.  But if you are looking for a truly tasty pizza (it reminds me of some of the best pizzas I've ever eaten back East in Ohio) try the Boulevard!"}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write a review as I don't want anyone staying at Southpointe to learn about this little gem located right across the street..... But it's so tasty that I just have to rave. Normally we be stumbling into the joint at about 2 am after gambling and drinking all day and night ( bonus! open 24/7!) and the food is downright tasty! Made it here for a regular dinner and I ordered the lasagna and have to say it was a little disappointing. The sauce tasted out of a can and the pasta was a tad on the done side. But the sandwiches I usually order are fantastic!!!! And you can't go wrong with the pizza. Crust is light and fluffy and toppings are generous. Also had a dinner salad and it was a meal in itself. A little shout out also to Jessica our server, very friendly and on top of things!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST and friendliest place for Itailian and American food!  The owner walks around and speaks to customers and makes you all feel welcome.. I myself have been coming here for a few years. Pizza is excellent also 1/2 price on Mondays!! Yum Yum"}
{"text":"This was a great atmosphere and the staff was very friendly. The dinner salad was great and the pasta was very good. The portions was large especially the pasta. My wife and I could have shared the meal. If you are staying at South Point Casino this is a must."}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood bar with great food (primarily Italian).  Jack was our bartender on graveyard and he was exceptional.  The pasta fagiole and tilapia were fresh and tasty. I am very appreciative of the lighter fare choices on the menu.  Tea is truly fresh brewed and tasted great.  I love that it is an Ohio State bar and the Cleveland/Ohio State/Las Vegas memoribilia on the walls were both very interesting and tastefully arranged (not too much and not tacky).   I plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"More of a real bar than another gambling spot. Food is amazing and they have an actual beer selection. Music is just the right volume."}
{"text":"This place NEVER fails me. I can always find something good to eat here. The wait staff are the best.and the food s great."}
{"text":"Quality food, open 24 hours, and lots of tvs, great for business travel stops when you need a meal at odd times."}
{"text":"I stay at the Grand View once a year and always look forward to eating here. The pizza is great and so are the wings. There is a little casino inside and beers on tap. Today I ordered my pizza and salad to go. The walking time from the Grand View to the Boulevard is 4 minutes."}
{"text":"So we wanted to check this place out for awhile cause it was recommended by friends of the owner. Went in tonight about 8:35 or 8:40 . The parking lot was full . A good sign. Went into the bar and the bar was fairly busy. We sat down at a table in the bar area. Wasn't sure if we had to approach the bar to order. We waited a few minutes and there didn't seem to be anyone working behind the bar. All of a sudden we saw a customer leave who had a little dog with her. Then a couple employees went running out following her. We said ok something's not right here. So we waited a few more minutes and somebody decided to wait on the customers. Most were waiting to pay up on their bill. A couple got another drink and not once were we acknowledged. So after a total of 15 minutes we decided to leave. Will be a long time before we try this place again. Management or the owner needs to monitor this place to see what's going on. If that was the management there that night then we don't need to check out this place again. That's a shame cause we only live within a couple miles."}
{"text":"Always consistent service and good food, yeah it's a bar, but everything is always well done."}
{"text":"One of my go-to family owned bars. Usually stop in during the grave hours and we love the company the bartenders give us. I have my usual go-to choices on the menu. the tomato and mozzarella caprese is always on point. I've had the chicken noodle and Italian wedding soups and they just soothe the soul. The pasta dishes are always super fresh and so flavorful. Not your average bar food, they exceed expectations for sure. Oh, and who doesn't love a gaming bar with great food and great service?"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a Lyft driver. This place is across the street from South Point , open 24 hours a day , the service is very good and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"I watched GAME SIX of the NBA FINALS here!  It's a CLEVELAND bar.... I am giving it five stars because you could smoke in there and game but it wasn't smokey at all and cause you could sit at a machine and did not have to game but the fact it wasn't just a bar but a gaming bar is cool...I LOVED there was CLEVELAND stuff EVERYWHERE.... I love the owner seen a few tears stream down my face as I watched the Warriors win on home turf and he came over and talked to me and then walked around the bar got me up and introduced me to his whole family and showed me photos and stuff important to him on his walks....the bartenders were very observant of water or drinks that needed refilling and the pizza was bonkers great .... Like honestly GREAT!!!!!  I was disappointed in the calamari but not as disappointed as I was in my CAVS.... I guess There's Always Next Year...."}
{"text":"Thus is a great Cleveland bar with really good food.  One of the few gaming/bar establishments that seems to care about their food products.  Enjoy every meal I have here."}
{"text":"Great staff - both bartenders made me feel like a regular, and glad that I was there.   Fresh squeezed lime juice is always a huge plus.  Wings were not knock outs but certainly good. Next time I'll order a hotter sauce (\"medium\" is a bit mild) & ask to have them cooked just a bit longer.  Calamari and marinara sauce was darn good."}
{"text":"Stayed at south point in January for my little sisters 21st. I NEEDED late night pizza. A very helpful bartender sent me to boulevard saying it was the best pizza in Vegas. He was absolutely right. The pizza was delicious and the bartender was friendly but not overbearing. My sister now have a tradition and making time during or on our way home to grab there pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The Boulevard is a decent alternative if you are on the South end of Las Vegas Blvd. The menu has a lot of choices that will satisfy most moods you could get yourself into.  We went on a Tuesday night and there was plenty of seating for a mid sized group. The server was friendly and new the menu well. They were out of a couple of beers and one appetizer, but told us they would be restocked the following day (not much good for us that night).  We tried a mix of foods. For an appetizer we got the garlic knots. They come on a plate loaded with garlic butter happiness and a side of marinara sauce. The garlic smell alone drove me wild! The New York Style Pizza has a delicious real cheese blend, but the sauce lacked any real flavor and the sausage was bland as all get out. The same went for the lasagna. It was cooked just like my mom makes it, which was technically sounds, just void of flavor (sorry mom).  The hoagie and the chicken parm sandwiches were the best choices, more flavor than the other dishes. 4 out of 5 on those 2 dishes.   I'll go back, I still want to scout more of the menu out, there are so many things to try here!"}
{"text":"Best owner in the city.  They know how to take care of their guests.  Honest and heartfelt appreciation for each and every guest every visit.   The New York pizza is awesome. Pasta is great and the Friday night fish fry is out standing.  The girls behind the bar rock!!"}
{"text":"Excellent go to sports bar and grill. They have friendly bar tenders and wonderful weekly specials. Authentic Italian food and great chicken parmigiana."}
{"text":"First time here was Friday for the Fish Fry.. it was actually surprisingly good...and for 8.99 all you can eat fish? Large pieces of white Alaskan pollock, corn meal breading which I don't mind. Wasn't oily.. the restaurant was busy, and everyone was getting the Fish.... That definitely helps with getting freshly cooked fish. The fries were thinner and crispy which I personally like for fish and chips. Service was good, friendly and pretty fast. Very casual setting but clean, and new. They must be from Cleveland... lots of memorabilia. Will definitely come vack"}
{"text":"Great locals hangout across from South Point.  Great staff, very good food and fair video poker.  Great sports decor with old Vegas photos in lobby.  Tons of TV's"}
{"text":"Omg, great service and my fried calamari was the bomb. I love how they really take the time to give a good presentation as well as yummy food. I've been here at least 10 times and always it has been excellent.  The food is consistent. It is very clean and tidy.  The bartenders are always on the ball."}
{"text":"Great food anytime, I love the eggplant parm sandwich but this time ventured out to the steak sandwich and it did not disappointed. The dinner salad is amazing and full of mozzarella. The cocktails are strong and great prices. This is a most do every time I'm in vegas"}
{"text":"It's NOISEY and fast food. Yes the food also comes out fast from being warmed in a micro wave. That's NOT ITALIAN & NOT HEALTHY! The service is friendly, but I'd rather have better food quality and a quieter atmosphere without a cancer causing micro wave. Another bogus place doctoring up the food with sugar, salt and artificial ingredients. Everyone wants quick food at the expense of compromising ones health. In the long run, cancer from the micro wave will get ya ! We will wait patiently for fresh cooked food, without any hazardous poison from a Micro Wave, But NOT Here !!!"}
{"text":"Being Cleveland fans, we wanted to find a place that would be showing the NBA finals game. Well, this was the place. Being owned and operated by a Clevelander we felt at home. The food was excellent and the staff was very friendly. They had a few large parties happening on the other side so you knew the kitchen was busy but it never showed. I especially like that the staff didn't get pushy or annoyed that we were there for 4 hours and ordered at different times. Thanks so much for the enjoyable evening! Next time we're in Vegas and need to watch our home teams, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place, food was good, beer was good, staff was nice, had OSU come through against Michigan State it would have made for a perfect day, sadly...  One point, the taxi drivers from the strip had no idea where this was and kept trying to take us to the Casino across the street."}
{"text":"Sooo much food. I had Tastes of Italy. It was full portions of chicken parm, meat lasagna and killer Alfredo. With fresh soft warm bread. I'm a big eater and I brought half back to timeshare across street for next day  Super friendly waiter and then owner came by to chat. Reason Italian was so perfect and authentic was brother 79 or 89 was the chef. Omg. Though I surmised He doesn't work all nights. We went on Friday. Maybe call ahead if real Italian is your quest.  Others had fish fry (fish n chips) and some steak thing. Both loved them.  Tooooo full for dessert.   Go here. A memorable meal."}
{"text":"Great food here. We usually get the wings, spinach salad, and original pizza. All three are amazing and some of the best we've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the food is delicious (especially the pizza), and staff are attentive. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and this place is awesome the food is delicious it's much quieter than the casinos and it's a local bar it's really can't say enough about the staff in the food"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about two years but used to frequent it religiously. I used to recommend the Italian food to everyone and they loved it but at a certain point it seemed something changed and it didn't have that WOW factor it used to. That obviously has been corrected cause the meatballs I had were fantastic and my coworkers absolutely loved the cavatelli and Italian beef sandwich. Owner Flore continues to be proactive and cordial as he comes to every table assuring everything is to standard. Will definitely be visiting more now."}
{"text":"For a throw down place, this is pretty good.  They are open 24 hours, which is not a rarity in Vegas, I know.   But if you are wanting something in south vegas, without it being in a casino or loud noisy area, I like this place.  It's fairly non-descript, it looks more like a biker hang out than anything but it's not.  It's like a sports bar but with good food.  I've had the pizza, which is just ok but some of the pasta dishes were pretty good and they give you large portions.  So if you are staying at the Grandview or Southpoint and don't feel like driving into the strip this place works."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, the service is amazing, The food is on point, and the machines are fun although they are hit or miss. Even after losing $300 each, all four of us still can't stop talking about the wonderful time we had at this establishment. We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Ugh! Don't go here unless you want to breath second hand smoke.  My husband likes to sit in the bar for the big screen Tvs but the smoke was so thick and the ventilation was non existent. The service was really bad. Wont go back"}
{"text":"Ayce fish fry fridays..... can't beat it. $10 is awesome for such good fish.  As far as other food items there, it's decent, even pretty good. BUT a little pricey for what you get as far as quality. Otherwise great place, they have a lot of regulars here. Super awesome service and really friendly great staff.  Again, did Iention the fish fry? YUM!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Vegas for years and would see the advertisements regarding the daily specials.  We always said \"one of these days we should stop in\".  Well tonight was the all you can eat fish fry. We did it!  AND we had the best food, the best server and the best experience ever.   We could see by the number of cars in the parking lot that there must be something good here. The family environment made it feel like I was a local.  The best part was that one of the owners (casually dressed in shorts) visited each table asking how we liked our meal.   We'll be back again soon.  You should try it!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is very nice.  It's open 24 hours  and serves good food.  There subs are good especially the meatball sub. The calamari is a good appetizer  too.  They have good pizza."}
{"text":"Very nice local spot.  Drinks very reasonably priced.  Food is great Italian food (especially for bar food).  I hear the Friday fish is amazing but I haven't tried yet. Bartenders are always friendly and nice. If you sit at the tables near the bar there is no cocktail waitress so you have to go to the bar to order but with the great atmosphere and great food it's no worries. Go Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was FABULOUS as was the side salad!!  That being said, I was absolutely  disappointed with the bread pudding ( pictured here). It was literally four pieces of bread with a whiskey sauce poured over it ( the white part is melted whipped cream).  Good service and nice atmosphere ( bar side and family side) , both have televisions for sports and other options."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood bars anywhere in Vegas.  Staff is top notch!  Jen, Stacy, Michelle, Britney, Rachel or Nestor are awesome!  Never have I ever had to ask for a drink.  Always on top of it, even with a full bar.    As far as food goes, Their pepperoni pizza is ridiculous!!!!!  Some of their other top dishes are the roast beef panini, Mac and cheese, and their salads are super fresh!    Being from Chicago, I'm picky to what I like and they do an unreal job here!  I have taken many guests from out of town and they all agree!  Lunch, late night or middle of the day!  Killer menu and excellent service.  Also a great gaming bar.  What more can you ask from here in Vegas!  Never know who you may run into!"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on this one, because the pizza deserves a 4 star rating, but the chicken parm was dry and not very flavorful and the pasta was not memorable.  The cheesy garlic bread lacked a little garlic.  I will do the pizza again, we had the New York style pepperoni and sausage, let's just say, no left overs!"}
{"text":"Bar food... My fav. This bar is right across the southpoint casino. Their specialty is their pizza the crust is absolutely perfect and guess what it even gets better after midnight or mondays HALF OFF PIZZAS!! So a cheese pizza will be $5!  CON: Cigarette smell is really bad"}
{"text":"Best hidden little Italian restaurant in vegas. Garlic knots and the steak sandwich are a must! Best Bloody Mary in vegas as well!"}
{"text":"The last thing I expected when we saw this place was really good Italian food.  What did we get? Really good Italian food. We started by splitting a nice creamy Clam Chowder (Ok, not Italian). It a had ton of clams and tasted homemade, Diane had the Chicken Parmigiana. Crispy Breaded Chicken with perfectly cooked Spaghetti and wonderfully flavored Tomato Sauce.  I had the Insalada Caprese. This was the most revved up version of this salad I've ever had! Along with the traditional Tomatoes, Basil and Fresh Mozzarella, it had Salami and Assorted Olives!  A great combination of Flavors!  We were seated in a side area that was wheelchair accessible, but it was a very tight squeeze past the hostess stand. I did not see the Bar area.  The Staff was friendly and efficient. If I ever move to Vegas, I could see myself being a regular here."}
{"text":"The food is FANTASTIC, and very reasonably priced!  This is NOT your typical bar food.  Once in a while they will have a Rib Eye Special.  Outstanding!  Try the Tira-Misu for dessert!  Unbelievable!  The Cajun Chicken Sandwich and The Chicken Club Salad are my favorites!  They always have specials....lunch, dinner, all you can eat on Fridays and Sundays, and half off pizza and pasta on graveyard!  Speaking of graveyard, see Howie the bartender!  He is why I keep coming back after 6 years!  The gaming deals from midnight-3am are nice too!  It is a great place to take family, friends, or clients.  There is no bar that comes close!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. 1st time going to eat with a friend who recommended their food. The service was above average and she delivered the wrong order but retrieved my order quickly. it was very good. On the way out i noticed they have specials which are at a great price."}
{"text":"Love this place! Me and my boyfriend frequent this place often. Good food and good service! Open all hours which is great cause we work night shift so they are still open serving the whole menu at any time!!! Have specials all time! Did the mention that the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Great place, exceptional service and a wonderful atmosphere. Haven't had a bad meal off of the menu!"}
{"text":"As a late night bartender on the strip, it's hard to find decent food options in the midnight hours. I have visited this place countless times in the past & have enjoyed their food immensely.   Last night, this has all changed. I ordered the penne with shrimp & the chicken francaise to-go for my fiancé & I. The wait on the food was ridiculous just for me to get home & discover the food was pathetically prepared.    The penne & shrimp pasta had a ton of pasta, little shrimp & hardly any sauce on it to the point I had to prepare some sauce at home just to stomach it down. The chicken francaise was dry & the lemon white wine sauce was broken & inedible. I wouldn't even feed my dog this garbage.   The bartender, Jack, was extremely inattentive as I had been gambling a decent amount of money & still charged me for the garbage I brought home. I would never recommend this place to anybody. Fire the graveyard cook because obviously he is not trained to do the job at hand. Owners need to look at this review & take it seriously."}
{"text":"This local bar and grille is a great value on good food.  The service is pretty good and they don't rush you through your meal.    We have been here twice and both times out check was under 30 bucks.  Both times we have brought food home because we were too full to finish.  The quality is better than what you would expect from a local bar and grille."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Pizza was so good and chopped salad too! The homemade bread is bomb! Will be coming back for sure. Tina our server was so far best we have had in LV she is a sweet heart who truly cares. Owner came out to welcome us for our first time and was very kind. Stop in you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Always friendly faces and great food. Stop in and see a lot of people winning. Have some wonderful food that's served with a smile (most of the time) LOL! I love this place been going there for over 8 years."}
{"text":"We've been in a few times since moving to the neighborhood.  Service in the bar side has always been fast and friendly.  Drinks are priced pretty moderately.  The burgers here are so good.  Im not sure if theyre premade, or handmade, and frankly it doesnt matter l, the flavor theyre getting is great.  Honestly, more flavor than GR Burger."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It's a small place across from the SouthPoint.  The cavatelli - was a bit bland for me at first. Added a lot of grated cheese and the next day the flavors had evolved into a good meal.  The ribs were very good - an entire rack - enough for 3 meals.  Staff are friendly. Sports is always on."}
{"text":"I own a competing bar, and let me tell you these guys do OHIO proud.  GREAT beer selection.  Over the top food.  My personal service has been nothing less than excellent (mostly, but that happens everywhere, even 5 star restaurants).  I shout from the highest rooftop, as loud as I can to go to this bar OR my bar if you are an OSU fan.  There are so many bars that say \"we show ohio state games\", but they are NOT OHIO STATE BARS!  DO THEY HAVE Ohio State decorating the bar?  OURS DO!  It just pisses me off to see them claim to be an Ohio State bar and not really feel that way.  Money grubbers.  Please support ACTUAL BUCKEYES (both of us) who own bars in this city.   Not providing my name or Bar out of respect....the Ohio way.  I Hope to see you Buckeyes out there this fall supporting either of us and not some dude that just wants money."}
{"text":"Although the building looks like a dentist office from the outside, it is a Ohio sports fan haven inside. There is a separated bar and table dine in area for the family. They specialized on Italian comfort cuisine such as pastas, soups, sandwiches, and pizzas. They have an extensive menu and their portions are quite large, so come hungry!   This is a good place to watch sports, especially if its Ohio based sports as there are many Ohio sports novelties decorated around the restaurant.   Although each meal averages from anywhere around $12-18, it is well worth it. It is a dark and quiet restaurant during day time, but I'm sure it gets packed and loud when there's a sporting event going on, unfortunately I went around brunch time when nothing was going on.  The staff is friendly, although I think they should have at least 2 waiters at the time I was there. The guy helping has looks overwhelmed by the amount of tables he had to service, which was around 7 or 8. Regardless, he did a great job.  Come give this place a try, it's a hidden gem in the valley!"}
{"text":"Such a BOMB burger!! They really load it up with the \"fixin's\". If I'm in the area, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being from Ohio and this being an Ohio based themed place made it fun for all of us.  The food was wonderful and the staff was sensational!  Very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.  Great place to go. Highly recommend!!"}
