{"text":"Great food and service. It is expensive but expected considering location. Highly recommend vegan tempura. It was just amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was not worth the money, but the service was great! Chicken karage was too greasy, so we left almost all of them, the Waygu beef didn't taste like Waygu beef at all.. The only dishes that tasted fine were sashimi..."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on summerlicious. They sat us down in the patios which the weather forecast already say it will be raining in the afternoon.  The rain did come and the waitress was avoiding us asking to move inside the restaurant.  People has to hold their plates when there is heavy pouring. Our appetizer - inari (rice ball from the sushi bar) arrived after 45 mins as the waitress told us there was miscommunication. We saw every table has a hold up and was wondering why. The exact reason is the sushi chef screwed up the rice.  The rice is soggy.  As a high-end Japanese restaurant, the rice is crucial. Our main course- chirashi (which is Japanese raw fish rice bowl) arrived half an hour later.  The fish is good but the rice is still soggy.  When the chirashi arrived, I already told the server please have the dessert ready.  We still have to wait for another 10 minutes for the dessert to come.  I ordered mochi which has ice cream inside. The ice cream already melted when it arrived the table.  My friend ordered strawberry shortcake, it hasn't arrived until I finished the mochi.  The waitress is very unprofessional there as I can see her swearing with the f* word with another waitress.  I understand they might be overwhelmed with the situation - raining and the order took long and lots of customers are complaining, they need to keep their professionalism. Yes, I understand I went there just for summerlicious but I won't be going back again in the near future even if it is free.  The one hour fourth five minutes lunch is really unbearable.  To be fair, the restaurant does give us a 20% discount, but I still won't be going again as this is a really bad experiences overall."}
{"text":"Third time was not a charm! What a disappointment! Despite the great weather (sat at patio) and ambience, the food was just subpar. It's very unfortunate as I have raved to my friends about my previous experiences.   We ordered green spicy salad, tuna poke, grilled green peppers, rock shrimp tempura, soy butter fried rice, robata pork belly, black cod, seabass, sashimi, 8oz Australian beef.   As you can see, we ordered a wide selection off the menu. Everything was just mediocre - especially the beef and pork belly ( how can someone mess up pork belly at a Japanese restaurant?) The salad was bland and not spicy. The cod was extremely small.   The best dish was grilled green peppers  What?!"}
{"text":"The food was very good full of flavour. The service was amazing .. the only thing I wish they have a wider choice of makis."}
{"text":"Do not book for special occasions. The hosts at the door run this establishment like an overpriced nightclub rather than a restaurant. Made a reservation well in advance for our anniversary. I called and got guaranteed a table on the rooftop on the busy side \"as long as the weather cooperates\". When we got there, multiple people ahead of us without reservations got accommodated because they made a scene at the door or threatened to call the manager. I decided not to -- and we got treated horribly. Not a single person acknowledged the fact that we had booked for our anniversary. And anyone I spoke to about finding us an alternative table promised to look into it but disappeared. We visit fine dining/Michelin star restaurants all over the world -- this is certainly not one I would be providing my business to in the future."}
{"text":"This place is so over priced for the quality of the food you receive.. ,and the service was good until the waitress threw a $20 bill back at me while leaving her a $35 dollar tip... I will NEVER recommended this place ever..I wouldn't even give them a star. There are better Japanese places in Toronto to eat."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding but waitstaff and servers made for an unpleasant evening.  It started with me calling for a reservation. I was on hold for 15 min while they potently tried to accommodate my request for a table for 4. Finally, I was told that luckily they could squeeze us in. What a joke. When we got to the restaurant it was completely empty. It took 25 min and a visit to the front desk to ask if we could see a menu. Appetizers arrived, and then a 40 min wait for our mains. All food arrived by our server who was so incredibly sour that it out a dampener on just how delicious the food is."}
{"text":"This place is the WORST!!! We had the awful service. Our server disappeared for most of the night. I had to ask for a table to be wiped down as if we were in a Johnny Rockets. And the food is so overpriced. I will never be returning"}
{"text":"Great dinner with friends on Sunday! The bartender gave us complementary champagne as it was an anniversary celebration along with a love note card with wishes. The food and atmosphere was wonderful too!"}
{"text":"definitely a beautiful space for drinks, but the food is very lack luster...we had a large party and was given a pre fixe meal, ended up getting the ceviche which had different bits of fish and root vegetables (mostly carrots) for main i got the wagyu skirt steak, the steak itself wasn't bad, but the sides were again...carrots and 2 pieces of bok choy. for dessert i ended up getting a matcha chiffon cake which was really dry but the sauces, nuts and garnishes were a good touch. i tried the chocolate stone which was a much better choice. i felt bad for the girls who ordered the maki as their main dish, it was ordinary sushi rolls...looked like mall sushi. all of this for $70. i then checked the menu to see the breakdown of the regular prices of these items...it definitely did not add up to $70. ceviche $16, 8oz wagyu, $36 and there wasn't a price for dessert, but if you are charging $18 for that...it's the biggest rip off of 2016. i get it that you are catering towards a large party, but the point of pre fixe is to make it easier on your cooks and supplies i'd assume, not to rip me off. anyways, staff was nice, no problems there."}
{"text":"Great opening night... unreal patio, I'd actually say best in town .  It's expensive but I'll go back"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting for this restaurant to open, and finally - during this last week of May - it did. I had great expectations for this concept. Immediately after learning about what was going to open in this building, I felt that they were building a Toronto version of Nobu. Clearly, Nobu thinks Toronto would not be a good fit for their beautiful concept which they've opened all around the world, so somebody else had to do it. I've most recently been to the Malibu location...and let me say that the people behind Kasamoto have clearly been to Nobu Malibu as well.   We arrived for an 8:30 reservation on the patio. An outdoor staircase takes you up to this beautiful area, beautifully embellished with wood detail everywhere. There are tables and chairs all around, but we opted for the more relaxed environment - sofas. The sofas are low and have a coffee table. Very comfy. The attention to detail at this place was incredible.  The server that helped us was very friendly and accommodating. She was very patient in explaining some dishes on the menu and even changed our order when we decided we didn't want something a few minutes after we ordered it (sorry).  The food was great. Not amazing but very well done. I'm sure the menu will evolve as they learn what people like and dislike, so I can't really review the food until a second visit in a few months. The soy butter rice was too greasy and tasted somewhat bland. The sushi rolls are very good.   Some people will find that it's too expensive. You're coming here for the environment and experience. A meal for two will usually hit around $200 or more with tax and tip.   Now the thing I wish they would improve: the alcohol. The alcohol list was lacklustre. In particular the rum. When I asked about dark rum, they only had Bacardi Black and Havana Club 7yr. These are OK rums. If you work at the restaurant and you'd like to please your rum-drinking customer, please get Diplomatico rum, or at least something decent found at other restaurants - Goslings.  Now in an effort to not ramble...the whole experience was good for an opening week visit. Big patio, great service, and interesting food. This restaurant will be a great success, but it needs to work on a few things...which I'm sure it will.   For now...it's a somewhat decent version of Nobu in Toronto - from the way that the menu is organized to the way your chopsticks rest on a stone on the table when you arrive, and even the wood paneling everywhere. Can I also mention they have the same umbrellas all over the patio. They're just missing the ocean behind the railing.  Get a reservation while you can."}
{"text":"We came here around 8pm on Friday night without reservation, and it looked like there were several empty seats. We were greeted by a team of hosts and hostesses and were seated right away.   We ordered: wagyu inari, fresh eel sushi, haidacore tartare, lobster slaw, and enoki salad.   Wagyu Inari - Very flavourful, but wagyu to rice ratio was on the low side. You get a lot of rice per piece.  Fresh eel sushi - Your standard eel sushi, not bad, but not amazing.  Haidacore Tartare - The taco shell is very light and airy, doesn't overshadow the texture and flavour of the haidacore. I loved the sauce and each bite was very delicious.  Lobster Slaw - This dish serves 2, the portion is quite big. The lobster meat pieces are very fatty and well cooked, and the napa cabbages add a nice crunch to the slaw.  Enoki Salad - This dish came last, and neither of us could have more than 1 bite of this. Something about this tasted very sour, like one of the cooks accidentally poured an entire bottle of vinegar in it. Not sure if it's meant to taste this way, but we weren't fan of it. Our server noticed we didn't touch it and asked if something was wrong. When we let her know the problem, she took it off our bill and asked us if we wanted something else instead, which was a very nice gesture.   Overall, everything else but the enoki salad was amazing, and we definitely want to go back to try other stuff. The restaurant is pretty quiet, and tables are spaced out nicely."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tempurara rock shrimp - how they made and fried the batter was very different from anywhere else I've tried. Other than that, the rest of the food was sub par and lousy service including missing orders. Another 'style without substance' restaurant in Toronto. Will not return."}
{"text":"Both service, food, and atmosphere is top notch here! Definitely a nice to place to go to impress someone.  We ordered:  shrimp rock tempura  - coated with not just tempura battter but sprinkled with slivered  mango so it's extremely tangy and tasty.  Wagyu beef: the beef is so soft and the sauce is not too sweet either  Spicy tuna roll: also delicious - the ratio of tuna vs. Rice is very generous!!   All the staff there were extremely friendly as well.  Definitely returning again."}
{"text":"I was looking at OpenTable to see what was available for Friday night and found that Kasa Moto was open! I got the reservation and made sure to mention it is 2 adults and a baby. They were happy to help us find a spot to park the stroller. We were in front by the windows. It was a nice spot which was out of the way and suited us. The servers were still finding where things are so my hot tea took a long time to come. Now I have to complain here and say that the server should have asked me what kind of tea would I like instead of serving me black tea. I also thought that since this is a Japanese restaurant, the default should be green tea and not black tea.  We were looking at the menu and the server suggested 2 orders per page. I was happy that we didn't go with that and just ordered spicy tuna on crispy rice, a fried rice, a pork belly robata, chicken 2 ways and a soft shell crab roll. The food was good but a little too much. We especially liked the fried rice and pork belly robata.  I think we would be back once the place is a little more established."}
{"text":"Lovely patio. Food is good, but portions are tiny and thus expensive. Average bottle of wine is close to $100. Well, this is Yorkville, what can I expect :-)"}
{"text":"Ordinary food and snobby waiters. This place survives on its Yorkville location, nothing more."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Kasa Moto since they had a new Brunch menu.  I had high hopes given the glowing reviews for lunch and dinner.  I was overall disappointed by the quality and execution of the dishes.  From the lunch menu: ****First dish that we ordered was a tempura battered broccoli florets with a soy flavored sauce to dip in.  We liked it a lot 5/5  From the brunch menu: ****I ordered the scrambled eggs with roasted potatoes. This dish was a complete fail! The chefs should be ashamed of themselves! Here I was expecting fluffy scrambled eggs cooked to perfection... What I got was dry overcooked eggs that Were just dropped on the plate with NO FINESSE looked like they came from a CHEAP diner.  The  accompanying potato chips were so greasy that I didn't enjoy eating them. The best component in that dish was the bread!!! 0/5  **** Rock shrimp Omelette My guest also didn't enjoy this omelette and found the shrimps to be dry and flavorless. he only ate half and we were famished! 2/5   BOTTOM LINE - Brunch menu needs a looooot of WORK !!!"}
{"text":"Ambience of the Rooftop Patio: 5/5 Food quality overall: 3/5 Service: 4/5  We chose Kasa Moto because of its rooftop patio, trendy vibe, and because we love Japanese food.  We were 10 minutes late for our reservation so we had to wait at the bar for a bit before our table was ready. The drinks were good but the bartender wasn't the friendliest. Not rude, but not great either.   We ordered the Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice, the Spicy Noodle Salad, the Spicy Tuna Roll & the Inari. It wasn't bad on the whole but the crispy rice dish was very heavy and the spicy tuna roll was slightly fishy.   Service was attentive and we couldn't complain.   We loved the rooftop patio at night though and the atmosphere up there was the best thing about the night."}
{"text":"Simply the worst food I've ever had in years. Portion sizes were too big. Lots of deep fried shit. So disappointed. Never going back."}
{"text":"Overal a nice place with good rolls and fantastic deserts!!!  I liked it. It's a good place to get together with your friends, have some decent food and a coupe of drinks."}
{"text":"3.5  Food: Pork Belly: texture was great, tender and juicy. But it was too salty. Gomaea: Spinach w/ sesame dressing. Decent dish. (Though I think Guu (now called Kinka) did it a lot better.) Kinoko Salad: basically fried mushroom with some other sautéed mushrooms i guess? Tasted good but again a bit salty at the end.  A5 Japanese Wagyu Beef: cooked on a heated stone. The beef was very good. This was definitely the best dish that night. The only downside was the dipping sauce, but beef tasted good without the sauce anyways. Matcha Dessert: the Matcha cake was alright, but the sauce-ish thing was sour and didn't go well with the matcha flavour.    Service: When we were seated, the area was almost empty and the service was attentive and fast. But when the place was later packed, the service got slowed down. We had to wave down our server  to get our bill and waited for about 15 minutes for the card machine.   Bottom line: OK food with acceptable service."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect meal. We ordered across the menu and everything was amazing. Wonderful, friendly wait staff. Try the black cod, the kasamoto and spicy tuna rolls, kamameshi rice, grilled corn and Moshi for dessert. Great Alsatian wines went perfectly with dinner."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Japanese meals I've had. After a long week of traveling and wedding festivities, my boyfriend and I finally had a night to ourselves during our stopover in Toronto...we requested to sit on the patio at Bar-moto and the atmosphere was just perfect. Great weather and set up out there, fast service, awesome vegan food options (spicy salad w/ tofu is AMAZING) and shareable portions. Will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Kasa Moto by accident after walking out of another suspicious looking sushi place. This Japanese restaurant is as much about the exerience as it is about eating fantastic food. Both are elevated but expensive.  The food and sauces are house made (including the soy sauce - both regular and gf). From the lunch menu I had the spicy tuna roll, scallops with house made aioli and crispy kale, and hamachi.  It's pricy but the service is exceptional and food even  better. Probably a good spot to go if you want to impress someone."}
{"text":"Waiter was super attentive and recommended great drinks. The sushi was good but the edamame wasn't a star app - my friend and I did not like the hoisin sauce to dip (but to each their own). They do, however, have an amazing patio! Would come back and try the rest of the menu for dinner on a good summer's day"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio Sunday evening. Nice but kind of dark.  Ordered : fried soba noodles - very nice , crunchy, crisp , will probably order again  Waguru fried rice - mediocre. Won't order again 12 piece nigiri sushi- disappointment. Overpriced. Lack of variety. Won't order again.  Aussie waguru slice - cook yourself on charcoal. Meat was tender and juicy. Will order again. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came to Kasa Moto for Summerlicious on a Friday night.  For starters, the service from beginning to end during our dinner was incredible.  The servers were extremely friendly and attentive and not pretentious at all.  Our group had the tofu salad (vegetarian however amazing) and ceviche to start.  For mains we had the arctic char - wonderfully flavoured, buttery, and a pretty large portion.. not to mention it came on top of a sweet puree and edamame.  For dessert we had the chocolate stone (chocolate heaven) and the shortcake.  The shortcake was dry and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Came here for a girlfriend's birthday, and it was perfect! The rooftop was hopping on weekday evening. Be prepared to spend, but be prepared to tuck into some amazing food with white glove service.   We ordered several dishes to cover a table of six, too many to count. Some standout dishes were: -The broccoli tempura, perfectly crispy yet bright steamed green inside.  -The black cod is something to savour, and DON'T leave behind that savoury, umami-packed skin.  -I also especially enjoyed a chicken dish with a creamy, mushroom sauce and brittle-like chicken skin, another skin to not sleep on. This skin is rich and divine.   For the birthday girl, they topped us off with a lovely, light chocolate mousse complete with a candle. Much appreciated!   A DJ was blasting electronic remixed of Top 40 hits and everyone was loving it. The clientele might not always be for you, depending on the night, but the food certainly will be! Expect to walk out feeling well-fed, and well-treated."}
{"text":"Brunch is one of those things in life that make you happy. It's probably because to have brunch is to say I am enjoying my afternoon(which is usually gone with busy things and errands or work) and today you are celebrating having the afternoon to yourself + food. I was in the area and i stumbled on this place. Now, there's an endless amount of brunch spots so sometimes it's tough to just try something out and hope for the best. Brunch in the city is a bit of a strategy. So, I decided i'll take the risk and booked a table for Brunch after my appointment was done.  Seating with the hostess was done smoothly. Fantastic service from the waiter & high grade quality food. Coffee could've been better quality but whatever. I opted to sit outside which is located in the back and up the stairs. Try for this seating when the weather is nice and most definitely book in advance. They have heat lamps just in case. My only issue with outside seating is bees and the speakers which were a bit much for an afternoon. The table design and cutlery was beautifully put together. Hint of fine Asian and dark colours with natural materials i.e rock to hold the chopsticks and natural linen.    Must try's: French Toast - insanely good and the garnish of the pear is divine Steak n' Eggs - Absolutely. It comes with a sauce that is lovely   The price is a tad ^eyebrow raised^ so I'd suggest booking this for a special occasion to experience it.  Bathrooms are inside and a bit of a walk if you are seated in the 'patio'. I like the style of separate stalls. Good design and clean.    Keeping this on my list of 'returner'.  xoxo M."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday evening. We didn't think ahead to make reservations for a table, but there were seats at the bar, which was just fine for us.  Between the two of us, we ordered the sweet and spicy cauliflower and three maki rolls - soft shell crab, spicy tuna, and the Kasa Moto (spicy scallop, lobster, and salmon). The cauliflower arrived relatively quickly, but it took the better part of an hour for the rolls to arrive. The cauliflower was pretty good - crispy and a good balance of spicy, sour, sweet, and salty - but a bit on the greasy side. The rolls, when they finally arrived, were nicely presented but they were average at best.  Service was relatively on the ball initially, but it fell off quickly. Nobody updated us on the status of our food until we asked (after almost 45 minutes) - at which point the server informed us that there was a party upstairs and, as a result. the kitchen was super backed up. What's more, some guy from the kitchen (maybe the expeditor?) apparently didn't like that our server had the gall to ask him a question and chewed him out in plain sight and within earshot of us for asking him. Yikes.  Overall, it was an expensive and below average experience."}
{"text":"My first time at Kasa Moto was pretty memorable! I'd always seen people post lavish pictures of the restaurant, and I would definitely say it lives up to the hype, and not just decor wise.  For myself, I ordered a tuna (can't remember the name now!) appetizer and the 8oz Wagyu steak. The appetizer was not of my taste, but wow was the steak good! It was my first time eating wagyu beef, so I can't really compare; I will say it was a very juicy and tender steak, though.  Also, the waiters were great! Usually at high-end restaurants, I'll find that the staff are very rude. However, our waiter was very personable and knowledgeable, which really added to the dining experience. I had planned to meet up with my date, and when I arrived early they escorted me to the bar and came to find me when my date arrived. Very nice!  Overall, a very nice dining experience. I'm sure there are better spots to find Japanese food, but the service and ambiance of the restaurant truly makes up for it."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. Great flavour but as expected small dish sizes"}
{"text":"We had coffee there . Beautiful decor and beautiful place . Coffee was so good and the cups were something to look at . Service was excellent"}
{"text":"The food is above average, I especially love the butter rice and steak. Have been there many times, brunch, dinner and just drink. But the experience is not quite pleasant Im afraid.  1. Patio - You would always be told that there is no guarantee for patio when you called to make reservation. One day I went with my boy friend for a 6:30PM dinner. The patio was pretty empty but we were told that we could not have the patio seats. We were about to leave with anger while a manager recognized us as friends of Madam XXX. Not surprisingly, we were given the patio seats within 5 min. - Is it fair for every customer of Kasa Moto? Why not make a policy such as cancel the patio reservation if the customers do not show up at a certain time window? What's the point to make reservation?  2. Service - Another night I went for dinner with friends. The waitress was stopping to check if everything is ok every 5 minutes, which was quite disturbing and irritating. We simply could not chat relaxingly. The restaurant was not busy that night (Sunday), but the waitress kept asking if we would get the bill."}
{"text":"So...I'm a little disappointed. I was really hoping this would be a staple hangout spot for the summer.  Here's the good:  - They renovated the patio very nicely. You don't quite feel like you're on a bubbling roof-top patio in Manhattan, but with the right crowd that could change quickly. - The staff are very well trained in their craft, very kind, warm and welcoming. Whatever your request, it will be met with professionalism and kindness.  Here's the ugly:  - The menu is very heavily based on miso and soy. If you like these fermented delights, you probably won't have a hard time finding something on their menu. My body, on the other hand, doesn't approve so the menu was a little lackluster. The burger was very heavily seasoned with lots of soy sauce, etc. and I didn't get to actually taste the meat. The tempura fish was what you'd expect, but at 3x the price. The cocktails are fine but much too sweet for my palette. - They advertise being open on the weekends from 11am, but they didn't open their doors until around 11:30. For someone with lots of time on their hands, that doesn't seem like a big deal. For someone working with a nap schedule, it's an issue that almost made us turn around and find another place instead.  Will I go back? Maybe for a drink and to enjoy the atmosphere, but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Came to try this place during winterlicious 18 as this is they're first year participating. Was very happy about the lunch pricing as this place is quite pricey. I got the vegetarian maki to start and it was a generous portion, my main was a salmon sashimi dish with roe similar to poke bowl with a small bed of rice. The dessert was really good as well I got a cake but the texture was mostly crepe and barely any \"cake\". Service was good but slow on a weekend as the restaurant was almost full at lunch time. Definitely a happening place in yorkville if you want to people watch and everyone is pretty dressed up."}
{"text":"Lovely patio, a bit loud for a large gathering but really like the Kamameshi, shishito peppers and skirt steak."}
{"text":"This place is pretty swank with a modern, clean interior but considering it was a Friday night, not as busy as I would have imagined. Items are definitely Yorkville priced (maybe 15-18 for cocktails, 10-18 for apps, 15-80+ for mains -- high end being the Wagyu, etc.). This was dinner one of two so we were mainly interested in drinks and a light bite.   To drink: FLIGHT OF THE REISHI is a vodka/lychee/grapefruit cocktail that is super easy drinking and just when I felt it was like eating asian jello cups, the grapefruit kicked in to ground it a bit. The CAESAR was a shisito-infused vodka base and wasabi rimmed glass. Did not care for the wasabi but the shisito vodka was delicious and made the drink taste like a spicy salsa. Potent but the kick doesn't linger for long. The HAMACHI CRUDO was delicious, served in a supremely well balanced yuzu sauce and topped with crispy carrot threads. The KAMAMESHI super reminded me of a lesser version of my mother's Chinese sticky rice fried rice (you fan). The truffled butter gives a lighter than expected fragrance and the mushroom/burdock root within provide some, but not a whole lot of contrast/interest. The wooden pot itself gives a hint of pleasant smokiness but overall slightly underwhelming considering all the hype -- echoing our overall feel for this place.  As an FYI: Peering over at the next table with not one but two orders of Wagyu, I see  perhaps 10 slices per order. More generous than I would have imagined!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Saturday evening, busy as expected but we were still taken care of. Sushi was great, and I will be back again for which I'm grateful. I'll be trying the wygu on the hot stone next time. Definitely looks to be a bit trendy, but I can look past that overall. Decent atmosphere. A bit smoky though from the hot stone cooking. If I brought my vegetarian wife we would have left because of the steak smoke and overwhelming scent."}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is definitely their rooftop terrace - great ambiance during the day and into the night. Their location right in Yorkville makes it convenient for happy hour any night of the week, and the menu is unique enough that you can't go anywhere close by for the same overall experience. Their staff are friendly, organized, and aware, which made the experience that much better. The Summerlicious lunch menu goes for $28, and has a vegan option available for every course of the meal. Unfortunately the food isn't anything special and for the price I won't be back - at least not for food.  Starter options from the Summerlicious menu were inari (vegan - sushi rice in deep fried tofu bags), miso soup, and robata shishito peppers (roasted sweet green peppers...some are super spicy!). My miso soup was flavourful and had lots of stuff in it - turnip, enoki mushrooms, tofu cubes, spring onion, and it didn't separate itself into water and miso powder if you let it sit for a while.  The mains include a grilled chicken or tofu bento box, bara chirashi (diced sashimi \"salad\" sitting on a bed of sushi rice), and (vegan) kitsune udon noodle in soup bowl. My chirashi looked small when it finally showed up after about half an hour of waiting after the appetizers, but it turned out to be a good portion for lunchtime. The sashimi variety was diverse and the fish was decently fresh. The wasabi to go with it was good - it was just the right kick and didn't leave any bad aftertaste. The chirashi is surrounded with dried seaweed shavings which entangled themselves as opposed to mix in with the rice - made it tough to eat, but otherwise I had no complaints. I was most happy with the wasabi from my main as the sashimi and rice itself were not notable.  Finally for dessert, there were a triplet of daily mochis, a strawberry shortcake, and a chocolate \"stone\" mousse cake with black sesame cream on the side. Mention that you're vegan and they should arrange an alternative for you for dessert - my table's vegan patron received a colourful and tasty fruit platter with diverse variety. The chocolate stone gets its name from the appearance - a perfectly round stone-like cake that's covered in a layer of chocolate, with a swipe of black sesame flavoured cream and candied black sesame seeds on the side. It almost looked like it should be a lava cake inside to go with the theme, but instead it was mousse and sponge cake. Unfortunately the flavour of the dark chocolate greatly overshadows the black sesame, and the seeds themselves were too chewy - they would've been better crunchy to add texture and again, play on the stone theme (eating rocks anyone?).   Overall the experience was good and the rooftop was very nice. The food was simple and left me craving to see what the rest of the menu had to offer - it was definitely \"fusion\" Japanese in the sense that everything was reminiscent of Japanese food but \"Westernized\" to suit a general public palate. I appreciated the effort for vegan options, though silently I wondered if there was fish stock in the dashi for the udon noodles. The presentation of everything is modern as well - black stone-like plates to give the oriental vibe sometimes but also clear glass plates to serve other items. Great ambiance, great service, great for those feeling slightly adventurous about Asian food but not ready for the real deal. If you're looking for \"Asian food\" with great service - here it is and get ready to pay for it."}
{"text":"Revisited more than a year later. The kamameshi (kettle rice) was so filling and delicious. I couldn't resist but finished it all by myself. The combination of asian mushrooms, truffle soy butter was perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????"}
{"text":"I went for summerlicious, which I think accounted for the crummy service. It seemed like the server had had enough of the influx of summerlicious crew and was pretty curt.  My appetizer was the ceviche, which didn't spark. It has no tang and lacked that fresh taste.  For the main I had the flat iron steak, which was pretty tasty and tender.  My dessert was the rice wrapped Japanese ice cream. There were three flavours: green tea, red bean, and mango. The rice paper was really sweet, so eventually I just ate the ice cream and left the wrapping.  I saw someone else order the the chocolate stone dessert and I immediately regretted my choice because their dessert looked way better.  Im going to say it's a one time visit type of place."}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise with its creative menu and intriguing blend of Asian and Western tastes. I came for a 10-course dinner with work friends on a Friday evening (warning: it's pretty long if you opt for this, took us ~4 hours!). I loved the wagyu beef (soooo tender), lobster slaw (this sounds plain but is really crisp and tasty!) and the albacore tuna ceviche. The maki course was also pretty good - the rice is light and aromatic, and the spicy salmon (?) is quite charming. The rock shrimp was also a real winner (MUST try!) - Kasamoto makes creamy and tempura-y work well. The dessert (a selection of pocket-size pouches of ice cream accompanied by a chocolate mousse) was alright, as was the service. Overall, great experience and hoping to come by again! :)"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a few months, because I haven't been in the area, but my dining experience was fantastic. I ordered soft shell crab maki and for desert I had a kind of ice cream? I can't remember the name I just know that it was fab. The food here is so good and the atmosphere is very chic (which I love). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another 5 star review! To be honest I'm not the easiest critique but I tend to know what I like and dine at places I've typically been before. Kasa is one of my go to spots. Their food is the best part about their experience (a VERY CLOSE second is their service, and the beautiful decor/vibe the architecture brings.) My favourites on the menu are the rockshrimp tempura, shishito peppers, sweet and spicy cauliflower, and the lobster slaw, which is a bigger dish that can serve two to three."}
{"text":"As anyone knows, I am a Sushi lover. I have been to some very good Japanese Sushi Restaurants before, but I have to say that the food at Kasa Moto was astronomical. The sushi rolls were fresh and tasteful.   The meal was for a group I was with, so the menu was fixed as a 10 course meal, comprising of a variety of different dishes, authentically prepared in the Izakaya tradition. This is the Japanese equivalent of the English Pub style of eating and drinking.  Small meals served over a prolonged period of time, to allow the guests to eat, drink and talk freely. I'm sorry for the poor light in the photos.   Our IZAKAYA Dinner was as follows:  Hamachi Ponzu, Daidai Vinaigrette, Yuzu & Crispy Carrots: This light tasting fish was served with a delicate yet tart Ponzu sauce offset by the tangy and citrusy taste of the DaiDai vinaigrette & Yuzu.  A great Starter.  Broccoli Tempura, Spicy Tentsuyu: Next we were served a traditional tempura dish, deep fried battered Broccoli with a traditional tempura Tentsuyu dip. Very nice with the sake.  Goma-ae salad, Spinach, White Miso & Sesame: Following the tempura was the seaweed salad, it was fresh and crisp, with the wonderful aroma of sesame. A nice change to the taste buds.   Brussels Sprouts, Smoked Bacon, Plum, Teriyaki glaze, Masago & Salsify: You cannot go wrong with the Brussels Sprouts and smoked bacon, this dish was lovely.  Sushi & Maki, Chef's Selection of Sushi & Maki Rolls: Like I said before, I don't know what these Chefs do at Kasa Moto, but the rolls were the best I've ever had. BAR NONE!  Robata Grill, Wagyu Beef & Chicken: Very flavorful dish. Grilled beef and chicken.   Soy Butter Fried Rice, Wagyu Beef, Fried Onions & Chives: This was nice to offset the Wagyu grilled meets.  Whole Roasted Sea Bass, Wasabi Chimichurri & grilled lemon: The bass was very nice, another traditional Japanese dish with a south-american flare.   Braised American Wagyu Shortrib, Kabocha Squash & Crispy Taro: We were starting to get full by the time the braised short ribs were served, but we gobbled them up nonetheless!  Dessert, Chef's Selection of Desserts: Desserts were ok, ice cream filled squishy balls. Yum...   We enjoyed our fix menu dinner, with sake and a Chablis from Domaine Bernard Defaix. The wine was white and not to my liking. I'm not a white wine person. Others said it was good. The dishes were prepared with care, and the presentation was very good, and the service was top notch. All in all I thought the experience was stellar. We all had more than enough to eat and drink. I highly recommend Kasa Moto, and I will return with my family to sample some more of that fine Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Yorkville is going through a bit of a food revival. There are some good looking but pricey options (e.g. NAO steakhouse) and also new outposts of old favourites on the more affordable end of the spectrum (e.g. Paramount Fine Foods). Kasa Moto is a fresh addition to an area dominated by a bunch of has-been spots that have lost their character or didn't have much to begin with (e.g. Remy's). I have heard stories about the bohemian Yorkville of the 1960s, but it's pretty hard to imagine at this point...   Anyway, my expectations were pretty high for this place and they were just met. It probably goes without saying that your wallet will be a bit emptier when you leave, but you will also feel like you've had a luxurious mini getaway within our city and that is definitely a nice treat.  4 stars on the setting:   We did not dine inside, but I have heard good things about the design and murals. There are even cherry blossom trees that have been created to complete the look. What I can tell you first hand is about the pretty patio. I LOVED it. It is relaxing and comfortable with zen design details like comfy big cushions and chopsticks resting on smooth stones. Get up there while it's still spanking new - I could smell the wood and was instantly transported up North and felt calm and content.  5 stars on the service:   The service was a highlight: our servers and hosts were extremely warm, but professional and attentive. The service was almost too good! Although this isn't Japanese-owned of course (Kasa Moto is run by the Chase Hospitality Group), there is that efficiency that you typically find at well-oiled sushi establishments where you are constantly attended to and your water won't go down an inch throughout your meal.   3.5 stars on the food:   The menu is pretty dreamy if you cover up the prices but it's not prohibitively expensive if you share a few dishes and stick to a couple really good drinks.   My Kasa Moto Caesar was impressive: shishito-infused vodka, Walter caesar mix, white ponzu sauce, sansho salt rim and garnished with pickled daikon. It was the perfect thing to look at and sip on in the afternoon sun. Probably one of my favourite caesars that I have tried before! My friend is pregnant and was treated to a refreshing and fruity mocktail, specially concocted for her. We really liked our main server (and we were also charmed by her Narnia-inspired lamppost tatt!)  In terms of plates, we shared the soba noodle salad, the spicy tuna crispy rice, rock shrimp tempura and the Kasa Moto roll. The roll was great -- scallop, lobster and salmon. Hard to go wrong there. We enjoyed everything, but next time I would try more of the cold plates, sushi and robata. The dessert we chose was simple yet quite interesting: there was a thin membrane-like shell coating around the ice cream (green tea, vanilla and strawberry). It tasted like a high-quality and delicate rice paper gummy. Sounds a bit odd, I know, but this stood out as one of my favourite tastes and textures of the evening. A sweet ending for a smooth & sunny afternoon and evening!  Bottom line: Enjoy the fabulous atmosphere, service and expect that your taste buds and eyes will be dazzled by a dish/drink or two. I will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE save your money and go somewhere else.  After seeing this place on Instagram for months, I finally decided to give it a shot with a friend of mine. Huge mistake.  Food was terrible and overpriced and service was non-existent."}
{"text":"If only I could give this a 4.5 star. Food presentation is absolutely top knotch, decor was classy, service was 10/10 and man was our coach comfortable....and those pillows.....so many pillows!!! I love pillows! Get the wagyu beef!!  Atmosphere: 6/5 Price: 4/5 Presentation: 5/5 Taste: 4/5 Portion: 2/5 Service: 6/5  Atmosphere: I don't really venture in the yorkville area much but this place is classy!! Apparently there are different rooms and floors as well. We decided to head up stairs and got seated in a corner couch table ^__^. I am a sucker for decor so the colour coordinated seating area and corner couch really did it to the top for me. Funny thing is they were playing a kids animal show channel on the tvs.   Price: This is an upscale restaurant so it is priced on the higher side. It is also tapas styled so don't expect to get too full here.  Presentation: Everything was beautifully presented and instagram worthy! Pretty sure igers  come here just for the photos.  Taste: Wagyu beef!! Melts in your mouth like chocolate! Get it!  Portion: Portions are on the smaller side as mentioned because it is tapas styled.  Service: Service is really amazing here. The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable here and they check-up on you every 5 minutes. There is no question you can't ask them and their professionalism is really really high!"}
{"text":"Let's clear things up - \"fancy Yorkville restaurants\" are overrated and Kasamoto is nothing short of a well-concealed scam for those who don't eat out often.   As an avid Japanese foodie, I pitted every dish we ordered tonight against something of the like from another local Toronto restaurant and Kasamoto lost in every category. Now don't get me wrong, the food here is certainly DECENT. I mean, for the price you're paying (note: $$$$), you best damned be getting at least decent food - but that's not what you should be looking for at that price point. I looked to be impressed tonight and unfortunately, everything came out short.   Just a few points of criticism: Australian wagyu beef was not marbled enough at its quality point, shima aji was not as fresh as Yasu, scallop was not as juicy as Jabistro, and the yakisoba noodles were like fried instant noodles that I could make myself at home.   The featured special pork appetizer had a fairly unique flavor profile, accompanied by a black sesame sauce and shallots.. but in the end, the pork just tasted like the cut of BBQ pork you get at Chinese places for 1/10th of what it costs here. The sea bass had a nice smoky grilled taste to it, but nothing close to what $40 is worth, especially when the meat ISN'T melt-in-your-mouth-tender. Sadly, my most enjoyed aspect of the entire meal was the signature Kasamoto roll which, although seriously lacking in flavor, did contain all the best seafood (salmon, scallop, and lobster).. so I couldn't not like it at least a little!   Honestly, take it from me that IT'S NOT WORTH COMING HERE. Your money is much better spent at other highly acclaimed Japanese restaurants where your wallet AND your stomach will both be much happier."}
{"text":"Wow!   My husband and I had dinner here yesterday and we are still talking about it.  We had a 7pm reservation and when we arrived the restaurant was mostly empty, one hour later it filled up. Mostly couples and a few groups of friends.   Highlights: Flight of the Reishi - amazing cocktail  Pork Belly Robata  Otoro Sushi  Chutoro Sushi Maguro Sushi Rock Shrimp Tempura  We heard a lot about the wagyu served on a hot stone and we had to try it. It tastes good but it's not all that, I wouldn't order it again.   I read some mix reviews about the service, we had the best experience with our server.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly overpriced that your eyes would pop. You can actually get the most excellent sushi at Yasa for the same price. I wonder how this restaurant justifies its prices? The quality of fish is very poor."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for Summerlicious.  When we first walked into the restaurant, we were greeted and seated right away because we had reservations.  The restaurant wasn't too busy at this time as it was still pretty early.  We were seated beside the windows facing the streets of Yorkville, nothing to complain about here.  The windows of the restaurant were floor to ceiling windows that opened up completely and the chairs they had were comfortable lounge chairs.  The restaurant was very posh and sophisticated with lots of hanging lights, simplistic decor and wood tables.  We were greeted by one waitress whom asked if we were all doing Summerlicious and had to wait a couple of minutes before our drink orders were taken by another waitress.  It seemed to me that they were kind of deciding among themselves which tables they were to serving.  My friends ended up ordering the white wine they had on special, which I believe was a Chardonnay.  (I wasn't drinking that night - what  a surprise!).  After that, the waitress took our orders for our orders for appetizer, main and dessert.  I went with the Lobster Miso Soup with tofu, enoki mushrooms, scallions.  For my main dish, I decided to go with the Black Garlic Soba Noodles with kale, shiitake, cherry tomato, black garlic sauce.  For dessert, I chose the Chocolate Stone which was essentially a Chocolate Mousse, shaped like a stone with black sesame cream, candied sesame to garnish.  I really enjoyed my Lobster Miso Soup.  It was delicious, tasteful and a twist on the regular Miso Soup.  The main dish was also delicious, refreshing and just the right amount of sauce.  The dessert was also yummy, but nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary.  My friends decided to go with the same appetizer as me, but different main dishes and desserts.  The main dish they decided on was the Misoyaki Chicken Karashi with miso, potato puree, bok choy, fried leeks.  They said their Chicken was so salty!  They almost couldn't finish the dish because it was so salty.  I tried a bite of their chicken and they said they wished they ordered my main instead.  For dessert, one ordered the Mochi - which came with a mango, sesame, and strawberry mochi, tasted exactly the same as what you would get from an Asian grocery store.  The other one ordered the Strawberry Shortcake - which was mediocre.  All in all, the food was okay, the price range for the food was over-priced for what it was worth and the service was pretty good considering the waitress came by to ask how everything was and if we needed anything else throughout the dinner service.  The only thing was when we asked for the bill, it took a while for them because it got really busy.  We didn't end up sitting on the patio, but I heard it was beautiful and there was a really long line up with a guest list for the patio as we were leaving.  I think if I do end up coming back in the future, I'll try their overpriced sushi menu and give a patio a shot."}
{"text":"This place is over-priced because it's in yorkville.I don't mind paying extra if im blown away. However i wasnt. If you're a foodie go to other authentic japanese restaurants. Food and service is average to good."}
{"text":"Nice variations on classics.  Good portions compared to other trendy Japanese joints.   First class service.   The only downside is the cost, but it does seem reasonable considering the area, quality of service, and exotic nature of the ingredients. I'd happily pay extra just for the nice ambiance and classy quiet environment(compared to the childish guu chain).  I'd come back for special occasions. Clearly others agree, they are super busy."}
{"text":"I came here on a date about a week ago  Sat in the patio, pretty nice   To be honest I had really high expectations of this place because its supposed to be really popular and its in yorkville and I love Japanese & sushi.   We got the shishito peppers   And a spicy salmon roll & kasa moto roll   Shishito peppers were awsome i loved them.  The sushi was very mediocre..  Ive had much fresher and better tastinh sushi at the all you can eats i go..   I would be back prob one more time to try different things on the menu to see if It can change my mind ,  But overall mediocre. Not worth the price .   Service however was quite good, I wish i remember the name of the lovely man who served us he was so cute , brought me a blanket and all because it was chilly as i was there late"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect coming in to this place as reviews have been all over the map in terms of what the food is (small plates?) and what the place would look like. I've passed many nights of my misspent youth here under its former moniker, Remy's.  As far as the decor is concerned they did a nice job redesigning the space, it fits well within the modern Japanese theme.  Based on the reviews I read, and after a quick perusal of the menu, I had a few questions for our server - mainly around portion size and how we should structure our meal.  My assumption is that the servers are given a \"story\" to pass on to the patrons in terms of how the menu is devised and how best to order off of it, however, the explanation we received was confusing at best.   At the end of the day, everything other than the \"large plates\" are appetizers - treat them as such. Two of us ordered three items and shared them, however, the third was really an add-on, two would have sufficed, and in most situations I would have just ordered one, like you would at any restaurant. But I digress on the menu - seriously, keep it simple, order an app and a main, or a bunch of apps like you would at a sushi place.  The food itself was hit and miss. Pork Belly skewers (Robata) were really, really tasty. The Shishito peppers were a great accompaniment. I also had the Wagyu Carpaccio, which was not good at all. The meat was drowned in liquid making it virtually impossible to eat (or taste) properly. The Tuna Tatake was uninspired, and for $19, not good value.  As a main we had the whole Sea Bass, it was proper. Really, really tasty. I'd go back just to eat that again. Our table mates had the 36oz Rib Eye, which was a bit of a spectacle coming to the table, but overall for $120, in my opinion there's way better value on the menu.  Service was good, our waiter was really attentive, and considering we were a Saturday night rabble of 8 people, I expected mediocre service at best. So, a real plus there.  At the end of the day, I would definitely come back for a pre-dinner cocktail with my significant other (the bar area is small, but quite intimate), and I'd definitely return to fire down another whole grilled sea bass."}
{"text":"Kasa Moto left a nice impression though I've been there just once.   The atmosphere and the decor there are hilarious. You literally immerse in the Japanese cuisine. I adore authentic styles, so this place can boast of real Japanese style.   The choice of food was extensive and the waitress helped us a lot because we could barely tell one dish from another. It was fresh and delicious and... not cheap.   Indeed, this place is not for those on a budget. Ha! There is nothing in Yorkville where you can \"save\" on something. So, be prepared to spend quite a sum there. Our bill was about $300 for 3 persons with 2 alcohol cocktails and several beers. Expensive? Well, I'm ready to pay $100 for authenticity, food and service, at least once a month ))  To sum up, if you are going out in Yorkville this place is worth considering even if you don't like Japanese food, you can order anything there. But if you want a touch of Tokyo, it will be a crime to leave this place ignored."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be taken on a lunch date to Kasa Moto and all I can say is wow! From the moment we arrived till we left was absolutely relaxing , delightful , and most importantly Delicious!!! We sat out on the beautiful patio in some very comfortable chairs. The edamame appetizer , which was just as exciting as the rest of the meal , was delectable and wet our appetites for what was yet to come. We then ordered the pork belly, the waygu beef, and they made me a special version of the scallop ,lobster and salmon maki with as i requested no rice. I just have to say that was the best sushi I've ever eaten and I've had some delicious sushi. it was amazing!! the service was impeccable and they are willing to customize anything you want and absolutely go above and beyond to ensure you the most enjoyable experience! I'm going to be dropping lots of hints so that my other half will be taking me back to Kasa Moto, I'm still dreaming of the beef and pork literally melting on my tougue..........yuuummmmmmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with parents and my daughter in a stroller. They were pretty accommodating in the that respect and found us a table close to the door where there was space.   We were greeted by the hostesses (3 of them). They were friendly but seemed not that confident about what they needed to do. I guess they were new.   DECOR The old Remy's bar transformed into this swanky restaurant. It's really narrow in the main dining area, and unless in the bar area or in the back, I would think it's a bit claustrophobic. Our table in the front was nice, except during the setting sun it was really bright through the window and they seemed to be missing some shades. I didn't find the decor that amazing, however, the patio seemed really nice and open and would recommend it on a nice day.   FOOD I would call it rather than a Japanese restaurant, it is a restaurant that so happens to serve Japanese food.   We ordered sake, which came in a carafe but served in wine glasses. It was crisp and light and pretty good.   We ordered:  Ceviche Salad - this was ok, but I was unable to find the small bits of raw fish and it was over powered by the chunky texture of cubed carrots, cucumber, beets and radish. It was good, but I expected more fish.   ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA - something I would recommend. Smaller pieces of shrimp deep fried and covered with a nice mayo dressing, served warm. It was crunchy and not soggy.   Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice - tuna served on rice that was breaded and fried. It was only spicy due to spicy aioli on the bottom. It wasn't amazing.   Kamaeshi rice - mushroom and burdock root rice served with truffle oil butter soy sauce. It was tasty, but not sure it's worth the $18. It was really tasty with lots of flavour, but not a lot of substance. However, a good filler for some starch.   Shishito Peppers Robata ($8)  - was good, grilled and nicely flavoured  PORK BELLY ($13) - good portion of two skewers with 8 big thick pieces. Tender and juicy, although I've had better at Yakitori Kinton.   WAYGU BEEF ($15) - was good and tender, with good flavour  (I would say the Robata items gave the best value for money)  BLACK COD ($32) - a bit pricey but really good and tasty. I'm always a sucker for black cod.   KASA MOTO ROLL  - one of the best dishes. scallop, lobster and salmon roll. much better than...  Rainbow Roll - not much different than the usual fare I've tried before.   For Dessert:  CHOCOLATE STONE with SESAME - this was amazing. a chocolate mousse ball on top of a black sesame cream. It was decadent. I would totally get this.   Ice Cream with rice paper shell - someone reviewed this and said it was really unique with this membrane on the ice cream. This was nothing else but mochi. And it was really small. It was good, but would pick the chocolate over this.   SERVCE Our server was really friendly, and laughed at my parents embarrassing jokes. Everyone just seemed shaky and didn't allude the confidence I expect at a restaurant. Maybe it's a training thing.   Food came out really fast. Impressed.   I don't know if I would come back again, unless menu changes and I want to try something new. It's definitely a special occasion place. Choose your dishes wisely and you'll get good value from your visit. Little things are really over priced like $4 for a bowl of white rice.   Overall our bill worked about to be about $70/pp including the sake."}
{"text":"This place is worth all the hype it's receiving right now. From the interior, to food presentation, quality of fish and service, everything was fabulous. A friend of mine went Saturday night - a bottle of wine, the spicy tuna crispy rice rolls, and 2 maki rolls we were pleasantly satisfied.   I adore Yorkville so any excuse to venture out there for a new hot spot; I'm all over.   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place was outstanding. It's kind of like izakaya, and very contemporary. The food was incredibly delicious and the waiter was very nice. If you ever decide to visit Toronto, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Place was upscale with friendly service. Came here while it was still warm enough for the patio so it was nice.   However, food was alright. Definitely not your authentic Japanese place. It was very \"Canadian-ized.\" My boyfriend and I really wanted to like it but some of the flavours were off and the food just wasn't that great for the price. If you're looking for authentic Japanese, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's just ok."}
{"text":"One of the worst Winterlicious experiences to date!  One of us ordered a cider but never got it. Two out of the three desserts on the menu were \" sold out \". When we left we saw said dessert items being served to other, non-Winterlicious tables. Unacceptable. Portions were minuscule. Service non existant.  Highly disappointed. Will not return to this establishment for Winterlicious again, if at all."}
{"text":"This place has one of the nicest interiors in downtown Toronto and good service. However, the food is completely subpar. We ordered about eight different items and only two were good--the beef carpaccio and salmon tataki. After those appetizers it was all downhill. The octopus was dry and tasteless. Probably the worst dish we had. The wagyu that is cooked on a hot stone on your table is fun but tasted rotten! Everything else we got was forgettable. Mushrooms were oily and tasteless. Lotus roots were also oily and regrettable. Even the Ceasar's was bad."}
{"text":"My wife and went here for mother's day and I can't say anything bad.  Our food was amazing (cauliflower, crispy tofu, soba noodle, and black cod) I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. The staff were all very friendly. My wife was a little cold and someone brought her a blanket,  very nice touch. My only complaint is that our food did take a little bit of of time (compared to other restaurants). Honestly though each dish was brought out, and eaten with a rest period after: and that was nice. I left feeling satisfied and not too full which is comfortable (I hate feeling too full ie. buffet style)  I would definitely say to anyone that this place is perfect for a first date late afternoon."}
{"text":"I've been going here every Thursday  since May. It has definitely lost its top caliber of service from a few months ago. Service is spotty. The menu needs some updating. The beef Robata was full of great flavour. Now just tastes charred and bitter. It's losing its value for the money charged."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a booking on the roof. I found it odd we had to join bills together with other people in our group. We were assigned a number. We had to say my number each time I wanted to order another drink or more food. Food was excellent. The rooftop was very romantic. Nicely decorated. Staff very friendly! Big tvs. I really enjoyed myself. I'd return."}
{"text":"I had pretty high hopes for Kasa Moto, as I usually do with restaraunts in Yorkville. I came here with friends mainly for the reason we thought the joint looked appropriate for a special occasion. We got a few orders of chicken and beef robata, yakisoba noodles, spicy tempura shrimp rolls, mochi, and other little desserts. The food we ordered, in my opinion, was mediocre. The yakisoba was basically a dressed-up version of instant stir fry noodles. However, where Kasa Moto lacks in exceptional food, they make up in charming ambiance and an over-all nice dining experience. I would definitely visit again for drinks with a couple friends or to take an out-of-town friend to a trendy spot, albeit I will pass on the overpriced and underwhelming menu."}
{"text":"We didn't even bother to stay.  We had a reservation for 6 pm.  I was made to confirm it 3 times (2 x email, 1 by text).  Upon arrival, I was second in line to be welcomed by the hostesses.  A man came in after me and the hostesses ignored me to serve him.  When one of them decided to attend to me, she told me I didn't have a reservation.  I told her I confirmed it 3 times.  She didn't believe me, so I showed her my phone.  After rolling some eyes, she found a table, let me know when my party of 3 needed to be finished with the table, and led me to a table at the isolated, musty back of the restaurant.  We left the restaurant and dined on the patio of Sassafraz instead."}
{"text":"Very great ambience and they offered wagyu steak that you can grill yourself on the stone. I also really enjoyed sharing the poké and beef carpaccio with my friends.  Kasa Moto is located in Yorkville so the menu items were slightly overpriced but overall a great spot for top Japanese cuisine and spending time w friends."}
{"text":"As someone who is annoyingly GF and now DF/MF i.e. no gluten or grains, no dairy or meat, it's tricky ordering at restaurants without it being a huge ordeal. Usually I email/ call beforehand--my due diligence--to avoid bombarding the server with questions.  Luckily, our server Anthony last night delivered and then some...he was charming and super attentive... and I left Kasa Moto satiated with no reactions (first time in months).   My friend and I shared the Hamachi Ponzu and Sweet & Sour Cauliflower--both delicious. For my main I had the spicy green salad with fried tofu (kitchen wasn't too busy so fryer wasn't \"glutened\" by tempura) and the sea bass which was divine. The simplicity of the whole bass reminded of meals in Portugal by the sea.   Given the awesome service, ambiance, and food, I'll be returning for patio season"}
{"text":"If you are craving DELICIOUS, unique dishes in Yorkville area, this is your place to go, especially for sushi. I had sushi here for the first time and LOVED it. Along with all of the other dishes. The menu changes which is also great because every time I return there are so many things to chose from. FYI!!!!! Make a reservation or you'll probably need to be waitlisted.  We shared a bunch of dishes: Lobster gyoza tacos (least favourite thing), vege tempura, rock shrimp tempura, mushrooms, wagyu fried rice(LOVE!!!), fingerling potatoes, chicken and beef robata."}
{"text":"The resturant looks nice and comfy . Service and food presentation are all good hense the two stars. Beqcuse other than that the food is ...not good at all . Dont even know where to start !"}
{"text":"So we came here for an anniversary dinner on a Friday evening. It turns out to be a failure attempt.   In General Food was EXTREMELY mediocre and Price is Yorkville price.  WHAT WE ORDERED:  Peach something cooktail   ROCK LOBSTER TEMPURA  WAGYU ROBATA & PORK BELLY ROBATA  SUSHI PLATTER  BUTTER WAGYU FRIED RICE  STONE GRILL AMERICAN WAGYU BEEF   Well, from common sense I would expect our food comes in an order more or less as how I list them here.   However, most ridiculously, the FIRST DISH we got was the FRIED RICE! Never went to a Japanese restaurant where I got a full filling portion of rice as my \"Appetizer\".  Second Dish:  ROCK LOBSTER TEMPURA: which I really recall fried shrimp from some Chinese Buffet(could be some higher quality Chinese Buffet though) with some mayo or sweet & sour kind of sauce  Third Dish: The STONE GRILLED AMERICAN WAGYU BEEF The quality of the American Wagyu Beef was OK... as it's much cheaper than the Japanese one, we kind of expect that it won't be great. So it wasn't the worst beef I ever had, neither it's surprising good in any ways. The dipping sauce was OK, nothing impressive either. The waiter suggested to dip into the Yuzu sauce first before grilling and dip the other sauce(can't remember) before eating. The Yuzu sauce was good, but the other sauce was kind of tasteless(maybe comparably). In all, it was not great, not too bad.   Fourth Dish: Finally it came the SUSHI! :P Again, it was really just OK. MEDIOCRE Quality. The seaweed wrapping the IKURA was even loose and peeling off :( :( :(  Really?Would you care to just put a little bit more effort in the food that you charge for that kind of price? The fish was not not fresh, but nothing great to say about it.   And then our ROBATA NEVER CAME. The waiter never realize that until gave us the bill!   And we asked about why the sushi is the last to come and the lovely waiter said it's usually that way-Sushi is alway the last dish.   Maybe. Perhaps, I have always been eating Japanese food in the wrong order or something, and should eat my FRIED RICE FIRST. Although the table sitting right next to us had their sushi fix first thing on their table. Also, the restaurant wasn't event crazy, there were still a lot of empty tables.  Yup that's my interesting night there. The decor and service was great though. I guess they tried.  In general, I don't mind paying this money for GOOD FOOD with QUALITY. However, this place just isn't there yet to charge for what they ask for."}
{"text":"You CANNOT go wrong with the menu here! Everything is good, seriously. The Wagu steak and spicy tuna crispy rice are my favourite go to items but the whole menu is delicious"}

{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for dinner. It's quite the Japanese restaurant located in Yorkville. The restaurant makes a lot of nice and delicious dishes. I ordered the American 4oz Wagyu Beef cooked tableside with ginger-garlic ponzu & KM steak sauce, Hamachi Ponzu with yuzu ponzu, crispy carrot & shiso oil and the pork belly with ume glaze.These were excellent dishes to try. I loved the hamachi ponzu even though the dish was cold. Although the portions were small, It was quite flavorful and the presentation was nice. The pork belly was awesome. I would definitely recommend this as a starter. Getting the Wagyu was quite a nice dining experience as you get to cook your own beef on a grill. It was quite good but hardly comparable Japanese Wagyu beef. Overall, a very nice dining experience but it is a bit pricey. Friendly staff and great customer service. A nice vibe in the restaurant adds a nice touch to the dining experience."}
{"text":"We came to Kasa Moto for their Winterlicious menu and walked away with quite a favorable impression. While the menu is pricey, I'd definitely recommend this place if you don't mind paying a bit of a premium.  Let's start off with the ambiance; Kasa Moto is just absolutely gorgeous. It was super inviting, cozy yet clean, and we just felt so comfortable here.   I had the albacore tuna tataki to start off and it was really good albeit a tad salty due to the overpowering steak spices. That being said, the steak spices provided a nice crust to the tuna. The ponzu was quite the compliment providing a citrusy kick while the seaweed salad provided the sweetness.   I went with the chicken karaage caesar salad which was also tasty. The chicken was quite crispy yet juicy and the romain hearts were intact and crisp. Interesting to note the karaage was quite dark in colour, presumably due to its flour based coating. The dressing was quite thick and creamy in a good way! The bara chirashi was more of a disappointment; as it resembled more of a poke bowl rather than actual chirashi. The sashimi was quite fresh, but was cut up into small bite sized chunks.  Desserts were all excellent and I loved all these 'asian' ingredients. The black currant cake was wonderfully tart and the chocolate stone with sesame is such a dark and rich combination.   So all in all, I did have a great time here at Kasa Moto, the food concept is great, the service was delightful but I'm not sure I would have came here if it wasn't for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????it was over price. I would not go back. ??????????????? ????????????"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place, the bar and the restaurant are truly a gem. Japanese cuisine at its best, in a very refined ambient. Tends to be very crowded so reservations are a must, very expensive and this is why it doesn't get 5 stars (I thought some prices were way too high).   Quality of service is IMPECCABLE, food is also first class.  If you like going to the rooftop for drinks that's also a great place, full of people, lively, great cocktails are served!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had a fun date night here. Our server was amazing!!! We decided to try both the regular and winterlicious menu. It was delicious and amazing for my boyfriend. It was his first time trying the stone Waygu beef and he loved it. The dessert menu was okay, nothing special. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner on Saturday night. They did not have our table ready due to confusion but was seated relatively quickly. The ambience is chic and lounge-like but it took FOREVER for the food to come out. We did have a party of 8 but even the appetizers took about 3-40minutes. They also mistook our order and gave doubles for several dishes and forgot about certain items etc..   Out of everything we ordered, I liked the wagyu fried rice and the chicken karaage the most but I've had better. It was just good. Teriyaki chicken was basically the karaage but with just slightly sweetened soy sauce, it was salty. The skirt steak was done to medium-rare but it was cut so huge it felt chewy. The size is bigger than a McNugget and you are not provided with fork and knives to cut them. The rock shrimp tempura people tended to like was a disappointment as they were tiny cut up shrimp with loads of light, crispy batter. I'd just order the broccoli tempura next time. The beef carpaccio had so much fresh grated parmesan cheese that it over powered everything else, never would've thought I'd be saying too much cheese..  The sushi and robata (skewers) were just alright, the plates used for presentation was nice but nothing great. I'd go to Zakkushi for skewers any day. Overall, they kept missing the mark and details in service but we tried to be understanding as it was a busy night. The price did not reflect the flavour but perhaps the quality of the food...and ambience? It was subpar. I probably would not be returning."}
{"text":"A Japanese restaurant that offers Wagyu beef in Yorkvile means you will be dropping a lot of bills when you eat here!  Came here on a weekday at around 6pm and it was relatively empty, made a reservation on OpenTable the day before and was brought to our table once we arrived.  As I had requested on OpenTable, they did give me a booth seats which I really appreciate!  The main reason why I decided to come here with my foodie friend was to try their Wagyu beef, and of course that is the first thing we ordered.  It was a tough decision between the 4oz American wagyu ($24) or the 5oz Japanese A5 wagyu ($80).  We ended up picking the 4oz American because we didn't want to spend TOO much and wanted to try other food.  Other than the Wagyu beef, we also ordered Tuna Tataki ($19), Kamameshi ($18), Sushi Traditional ($50), two pieces Sea Eel aka Anago ($10) and two bartender's choice of mocktails ($5 each).  Let's start with the cold dishes. Tuna Tataki presentation was amazing, the seared tuna paired with their special sauce and veggie tasted very fresh.  The Sushi Traditional presentation was also very nice, but the fish was not as fresh as places such as Miku or Jabistro, I didn't think it justifies the $50 price tag for 8 sushi and a tuna maki roll.  Sea Eel was very good, I always loved Sea Eel (anago) over freshwater eel (unagi).  The eel was fresh with great sauce pairing, but I would prefer Nami's Anago more.  Here comes the best part of the night, the hot food here is exceptional.  I would say the hot food here is probably one of the best I ever had.  Wagyu beef was great, I love the presentation where they have a hot stone and you grill your wagyu beef on top of it, a very neat concept.  Beef itself tasted very good as well, sliced perfectly to give the best texture.  Kamameshi is probably the surprise of the night, my fellow yelper Cherrie recommended the Kamameshi and it did not disappoint!  The truffle really brought out the flavour of the rice, the buttery smell mix with the truffle really nailed it!!  I highly recommend this dish!!  Overall the experience was great, great setting, great service and great hot food.  If only the cold food was also fantastic, this place would get a 5 in my book."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time!  I cannot comment on the food, because we were never seated or fed. I can comment on the terrible service, from the hostess to the manager.  The concierge at our hotel recommended Kasa Moto and made the reservation for us. When we arrived we were told that the next available table was finishing up and we were asked to have a seat in the bar.  After 35 minutes, and seeing other parties seated ahead of us, Hubby asked the hostess about our table. She replied that they she'd tried to call us, but we didn't answer. When my husband responded that she had not asked for our phone number, she just stared at him blankly.  Hubby came back to the bar and asked a waitress to get the manager, briefly explaining the issue.  We saw the waitress speak to the manager, who then walked up front and then into the back, without stopping to speak with us. The waitress then came over with menus and offered to serve us in the bar.  We saw previous reviews with similar stories...we should have headed their warnings."}
{"text":"I had a reservation and got a really crappy table, can't say I got to see what the restaurant looks like as I was seating at a table in a narrow hallway....the staff was arrogant, server and what appeared to be a manager. Told one of them there was vomit in the washroom and almost felt bad for telling him, didn't seem like he appreciate being told the washroom was painting a bad image of the restaurant (supposed to be fancy and in Yorkville right?) I won't come back."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant last night for the first time. It's styled very nicely and looks fresh and chic. We did not need a 7:30pm reservation which is nice. We had the rock shrimp tempura which was amazing, then the Wagyu fried rice which was also amazing but then the Spicy tuna maki was not great all all. It was as if the tuna was ground up and piped into the roll, very strange and sad we left half the dish untouched. The serve never asked about now the meal was which is interesting because they could see we clearly left food uneaten sadly. Ambiance is nice but don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"The best part about Kasa Moto is the ambiance. They have done wonders renovating the old Remys rooftop patio, which ranges from sunny and inviting during the day and more lounge-y at night. The crowd that frequents this place is very fancy - everyone seems to have stepped out of a photoshoot from Italian vogue.   Regarding the food, I recommend the hamachi ponzu, kasa moto roll, and the shrimp burrito. The hamachi was so delicious and refreshing, but a bit pricey at $18 for a few slices of yellowtail. The poke bowl, pork belly skewers, cauliflower, and broccoli tempura were all tasty but not mind-blowing. The striploin is WAY too salty. Do you like raising your blood pressure by 20 mmHg? Then this dish is for you.  Overall I would go back simply for the rooftop patio, and have a few snacks with drinks. Probably would not go back for a full dinner."}
{"text":"my second time at kasa and yes, the food is great - but i don't know that i'll be returning. my first time there, we had a table for 4. we basically ordered a few apps (2-3), a few entrées (2-3) and i believe the kasa roll, can't remember. what stood out the most in the meal was the rock shrimp, delicious, flavourful and perfectly battered. i remember the fried rice was great as well.   i came back here a day before mother's day, there was 4 of us. we figured we gate crowds so made a reservation properly a month ahead. we got there and was at at the booth by the bar. we order: rock shrimp, of course, and the new tuna tartare, pretty good, full of flavours and texture. we enjoyed the apps ... it took nearly 40 minutes for the remainder of our food to come. we ordered the wagyu steak and the beef fried rice. yes, the fried rice was just as great as i remember, especially now that we've been waiting for so long - the steak was mediocre. it definitely was not worth the $42 we paid, it wasn't good at all. lastly came the yam tempura. yes the yam tempura came last and not full cooked.   we were not satisfied at all. i saw the manager and very very nicely said that i wanted to provide some feedback and next time they should really make an effort to not keep customers waiting. he did apologize said he would offer us dessert, we declined. there was no reason for us to want to stay any longer.   note. their main area was NOT full. manager explained there was a party upstairs they were serving. so does that mean the rest of your orders get neglected? what do you do when the entire dining room is at full capacity?   the server did the best he could considering the circumstances. he took the yam tempura off the bill and apologized. said i didn't have to tip him, but i did, of course.   all things considered, we did not feel we were valued as customers. especially seeing as we sat for over an hour for out food. we never saw or heard from the manager again when we were leaving, nor when the food finally. i expected it more from kasa moto, especially being a restaurant in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch. We were seated upstairs in the patio. Great atmosphere and great service but gave it a 3 star for ok food. Ordered sangria, Rock shrimp tempura, chicken 2 ways and soy  butter fried rice. Sangria was great and enjoyed it thoroughly. Food presentation was amazing. My favorite food was rock shrimp tempura. I would come back for drinks."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Extremely fresh and flavourful sushi and mains. We tried the lobster main (it's meant for two people) and classic rolls (I believe it was California). Both were very good. A couple at another table had a very interesting main that looked like meat on a grill, sort of like Korean bbq. We might try it next time we're there.  Our server was very nice and the food came out pretty fast.  This place is a bit pricey, but would be perfect for special occasions."}
{"text":"I find myself to be a fairly generous reviewer, so when I have to give a restaurant 1-star, it would have to be for an experience that leaves a very bad taste in my mouth for days after coming here. Kasa Moto did just that with my experience with them on brunch on Sunday.  It was my second time here as my first time with them was alright. The weather warmed up and I wanted to check out their patio, given that the restaurant has a nice vibe in a cozy area of Yorkville. The brunch prices are also pretty good given that it's in a somewhat upscale environment. It's also a nice departure from the usual brunch items you see at most restaurants as they offer a Japanese-fusion style kind of brunch, such as chicken katsu sandwiches.  However, the brunch service got off to a bad start when no one came to take our order. I think we were placed in a corner where servers generally tend to miss us, but I couldn't even figure out who the primary server of our table was as I had to call down for anyone to help us every single time as the service was so inattentive. Turns out there was someone assigned to our table, she just either had an off-day or just had a terrible demeanour overall.  The worst part of the service was when I asked for the salmon to be returned. The salmon teriyaki they served me was undercooked to the point where it was like ahi-salmon. I opened up the middle of the two small pieces and they were completely raw. I asked for the salmon to be more cooked, and the server didn't apologize, didn't acknowledge that it was raw, and just took it back to the kitchen. We had a giggle about it, but maybe she didn't want to apologize for something that wasn't her fault - if that's ever a good reason as a server.  The salmon came back and to my disgusting surprise it was the same piece of salmon that they recooked with the bitten piece cut off to make it seem like a new piece - and it was STILL undercooked. I had to take a picture this time to show how undercooked it was even after requesting for it to be cooked again. Also, because they just straight up re-cooked the same piece in a pan, obviously all the marinade came off the salmon and it ended up just being a bland undercooked salmon. Even the outside wasn't salvageable anymore. I also can't imagine a chef taking someone's bitten piece of food with their saliva on it touching their cutting board, their knife, their hands, and their pan - while also making other people's food.  I barely took a few bites extremely disappointed with my food and just wanted to leave by that point, embarrassed that I gathered a group of friends to suggest coming here based on my first pleasant experience with them. When the same server came to take our dishes, she even saw that I didn't eat anymore of the salmon after asking for it to be returned and didn't make one comment about it or take notice of it what-so-ever. I still couldn't figure out what her issue was, maybe she just was in an off-mood or she's just working in an industry that's not the right fit for her. The chicken teriyaki my friend ordered was also slightly burnt but salvageable, while the chicken katsu sandwich my other friend ordered was decent so I have to admit not everything was terrible.  But after a very overly-dragged out frustrating brunch, I got fed up waiting for the bill, went up directly to the entrance and just asked for the lady at the front to immediately call anyone to just give us our god damn bill. She was extremely apologetic about the inattentive service and got us someone right away despite me being quite irritated by that point - if I could give individual servers stars, she would deserve a 5 for how she handled my frustration. Excellent response on her part, very professional and seemed very experienced. Then another lady came to me and comped me a $50 gift card (~1/3 of the bill) for the ordeal and gave me her business card and told me to call her the next time I come to make up for the experience. I really do appreciate the gesture but I doubt I'll make my way back here any time soon even if the entire meal was free. It was just that bad.  If it was just the one server's fault I probably would have given them 2-stars for how they handled the situation, but the fact that they sent me back the exact same piece demonstrates that there was also something very wrong with the kitchen staff. Any chef would have known that recooking the same piece of meat would result in a loss of flavour, so you should cook a new piece - maybe salmon just happened to be scarce that day but I personally think they were just being lazy. Maybe our server's vibe also rubbed off on them.  Anyway, that was my experience at Kasa Moto. I'm sure yours won't be as bad, but it was bad enough for me to avoid this place in the future - even though it's right next to where I live."}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because the margarita was good & it's the lowest rating I can give. The management & hostesses at this restaurant were so rude and pretentious, making my friend and I feel uncomfortable for the whole 30 minutes we were there.   They made us move tables twice saying there was a reservation at both after telling us we could sit anywhere near the Bar. There was no \"I'm Spoken For\" sign on either tables we chose but a minute after we sat down at each one, they told us to move because someone was coming in 10 minutes. Even the patron beside us asked us if we wanted to join their table because they saw how we were being treated. There was an old man dancing like he was on bath salts creeping me out. But after spending only $80 in half an hour, we were the ones that weren't welcome."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Overall, the food is underwhelming. Service and ambiance are good, albeit stuffy, but that's not enough at this price point."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the A5 wagyu beef and it was amazing! Highly recommended. However, the service was slow and the employees were goofing around a lot everywhere which made our dining experience worse. The lights in the bathroom didn't work and we had like 4 different servers which was confusing. Besides the service and the way the employees were acting, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from an expensive Japanese restaurant in Yorkville. Average food amidst a bougy vibe. Have the punch or wine. The cocktails were 0/3."}
{"text":"Modern swank space in Yorkville. Can't argue with the style in here.  So after checking out the space and say, the modern washroom - how about the food and drinks?  Let me put it this way, you're in yorkville. You've got luxury shops all over so expect the price point to be somewhat inflated. IF you 're mind set is like that, you will absolutely be fine.   How does the food taste? Well, it's okay. WE had the karate to start. It was crispy yet tender. The wagyu beef rice was good but a tad over seasoned. Not bad but I don't know if I would order it again. For dinner we ordered a whole bbq fish. It was also okay. I truly wanted it to stand out more instead. For dessert, we had one of my favourites of the night, mochi ice cream. Loved it.  I also enjoyed the Flight of the reishi. A lychee drink. We had 2 versions - one with alcohol and alcohol free version (just ask for it - its possible).  We had three of these.   I read a lot about the customer service issues here which of course made me worry a little. The service was on point from start to beginning. We were promptly seated and didn't wait long at all for anything we ordered.  Although it was busy we never felt rushed to leave."}
{"text":"This spacious upscale Japanese resto-bar is in the space formerly occupied by legendary Yorkville booze-patio Remy's.  They have upgraded the enormous rooftop deck, so we will be back in warmer weather to check it out.  We were pleasantly surprised to be able to walk up and get a table for four on a Friday night.  It was the last free table of the night- this place is busy.  Our table ordered mostly small plates.  The Sweet and Spicy Cauliflower was different than the current popular version- it's not breaded and deep fried, but pan fried.  Delicious.  The spicy tuna crispy rice was excellent, delicately deep fried, but very small.  We had a sushi roll, and the rice was sparse allowing the freshness of the fish to standout.  On to rice and noodles- we ordered the Kamaeshi rice, which was my favorite dish of the night- truffle oil and wild mushrooms, made table side.  For noodles we had the Yakisoba- raw egg and braised cabbage.  Really good.  We finished with the Wagyu Beef Hotstone, which was the only disappointment of the night.  You need to marinate in oil to avoid having the beef stick to the stone and smolder.  As the stone cooled, the beef would never cook through.  And frankly, I don't know why I order Wagyu or Kobe, I am always disappointed in the cut and texture.  Our server was excellent- great sense of humor, but not obtrusive- very professional.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the lady. Portions are quite large. Presentation is amazing. Service was excellent. Place was really quiet for Saturday brunch.  What we ate:  French toast and poached nashi: Super sweet. Fruits were really fresh. Really enjoyed this one.  Breakfast bento: interesting for brunch. The rice was tasty. The pork belly was really juicy and addictive. Lots of food.  Salmon tataki on toast: the wasabi was kinda noticeable but mild. The salmon was really good. Presentation was amazing.  Overall, probably would eat here again if in the area."}
{"text":"This location is extremely expensive and the portion size is not reflective of the big pricing. Food quality is good. Can easily spend $200+ no alcohol dinner for   3.25/5 *"}
{"text":"If you've ever visited a Nobu or Katsuya or Katana or Koi you're gonna be disappointed. Nice enough with the right vibe and despite the aromas and great looking food coming out of the kitchen the sushi unfortunately falls short. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was disappointing and the other rolls were nice but very fishy tasting. Nice atmosphere, enjoyable evening but disappointed in the food. It was nice but not great"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy Casa Moto. It's American style Japanese. We were given the table right next to the door and the air conditioning was blowing as well. I had to leave my jacket on during dinner. We asked for another table and were told to wait an hour. Meanwhile, there were plenty of tables open. The food was disappointing and the music not relaxing.   I much preferred Ja Bistro."}
{"text":"Horrible service Terrible food Cheap decor  I went here and I ordered maki lobster scallop and crab sushi - it was tasteless and overpowered with white wasabi mousse  I ordered the 12 pierce sashimi, which was fresh but it was served on a stone plate. It's common sense to serve raw fish on a white platter to showcase how clean and fresh it is. Terrible presentation.   I ordered the rock shrimp, they were chewy with the texture like they had just been reheated in the microwave   I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and had absolutely no flavour whatsoever  Finally I ordered the chicken robatta and it came to the table raw. The waitress, who was wearing sunglasses, yes a waitress with sunglasses, asked me if I wanted to put it back on the grill. I was so turned off by that point that I just picked up and left.   Also, when it came time for the bill and paid cash, the waitress comes to pick up the payments and asked me if I need change. What a silly question considering that what I had left would be tipping her 35%   The decor is cheap, and dead ivy growing on the wall and dead plants in baskets.   I think they are trying too hard here and it shows.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Made reservations for Valentines Day with my girlfriend. The service is exceptional and the concierge arranged to have a dozen roses at our table when we arrived. As promised the roses were there and my girlfriend was pleasantly surprised. We had a few courses Izakaya style. The oysters, caviar, maki sushi, tuna ceviche, beef tenderloin, and deserts were exquisite. Our server was also very friendly and very accommodating for my girlfriends allergies. He made sure that each dish and drink was safe for her. We had a great table nestled by the Old Yorkville walkway and had a romantic night out. Will come here again and recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"We came here for my moms birthday in August and and was surprised that  Kasamoto was not as busy on a Friday night. The atmosphere was very warm with lower lighting and unique decor. The hostess went above and beyond to welcome us in as we arrived.  Everything here is meant to be shared and an ideal party would be 4-5. If you have more, it was recommended to get two of a certain dish to get an adequate amount each.  Although on the pricey end, the food was short of comparison to Zuma and Tao.  I would recommend The rock shrimp and the dry aged beef wagyu for the starters. The black cod was on the smaller side but was greatly seasoned.  Unfortunately, the crispy rice tuna was not the best. The spicy tuna crispy rice was not very crispy which made it pretty ordinary.  Next time we come here, I will definitely want to check out the Patio. The music was good but we just did not have time to explore any more."}
{"text":"Just had a plate of black cod and a glass of Chardonnay. It tastes super excellent. Not forget to mention the service is satisfying, friendly and helpful staff! Good ambience and good crowd!"}
{"text":"A typical Yorkville restaurant: overly expensive for only average food; attitude from the girls at the hostess stand; the usual pretentious crowd of superficial women and old men. Better places elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although it is not fair to judge a restaurant on opening night I feel confident that Kasa Moto is going to be a rising star in Yorkville. The wagyu beef is perfectly seasoned and prepared. All sushi dishes exceeded expectation. The service was well above average. We ate at the bar and it was very comfortable. The bartenders are masters of their craft."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant has this pristine marketing image behind it...but it does not live up to that image.  Im giving it a 4 star because the location is very convenient for my friends and I to enjoy the perks of having a rooftop during the summer. Its always a good time and its definitely a good place to get together and have drinks.   BUT for those who have never been here or who have been here once and dont think much of the place...I HAVE TO AGREE. Funny enough the food is a hit or miss. Sometimes the food is decent and sometimes its just NOT GOOD.   I have had an issue with the food, the hot stones not heating the wagyu properly, or food just being sent out cold...  I normally dont complain and I typically try to let certain things slide but when your at kasa moto and expecting the best dining experience and they dont deliver and it happens more than once...you best believe im going to say something about it.   After i made my complaint to the server he just brought a new dish of the same order to make up for it..but I didnt get the dish for another 25 minutes! By that time i lost my appetite and I didnt even end up touching it. To compensate for this...they served us their most \"delicious\" desert on the house....and let me tell you...it was far from that.     So if i didnt come here regularly, honestly, i would give this place a 3 star rating. But im a fan for other reasons and its a super convenient location for me and so I will always go back. But i wouldnt come here to have sushi or wagyu.   Lesson learned: go to a beat down sushi restaurant for good sushi and for steak go to the best god damn steak house in toronto and get yourself a wagyu steak. You dont go to kasa moto for that.  If you want to have a good time with friends and are looking to have a few drinks and just chill, come here...The only thing I recommend is the rock shrimp and wagyu fried rice - ROOFTOP only."}
{"text":"\"It may be a better Night Club....its all about the VIP\"  After reading a Toronto Life article about the re-opening of Remy's as a Japanese Restaurant/ Nightclub, I decided to stop by, have a drink on the rooftop patio and try some of the wonderful sushi the TL reviewer raved about.  We entered at 5:30pm without a reservation and were greeted by 3 lovely hostesses. I was with a colleague in our suits and we asked to have a drink on the rooftop patio and sample the sashimi. Although we mentioned we would only be there for about 30 minutes, the hostess said they are \"fully committed upstairs\" (in other words, \"you're just not VIP enough\") and asked if we wanted a seat at the bar. I was ready to walk but my guest said we should do that.  The bar in the restaurant is pathetic. After being approached by one bartender that was obviously intelligent and professional, we ordered some wine and sashimi and rolls. Then we were spoken to by another bartender who said \"the only problem with the sushi is that you're not gonna be able to stop eating it\". It was a great line for a younger crowd maybe unfamiliar with sushi. My 20 year old daughter would have found it trashy and it came out in that manner. There were about 3-4 staff behind the bar directly in front of us preparing for the evening, which made our quiet business discussion almost impossible. Peeling lemons, cleaning cantaloupes, etc. should not be done 2 feet from paying guests sitting at the bar.  The sushi itself, Rainbow Rolls, Hamachi Nigiri and Tuna and Salmon sashimi were nothing special and I can name 10 Japanese restaurants in the immediate area that are far better and half the price. The waiter said \"our sushi features thick cut pieces of fish\", but he must have been comparing that to the all-you-can-eat places. Having been to Japan several times, I can tell you this place is not about the sushi. The sashimi was cut into cubes which was disturbing since its not the traditional way and offers no improvement on the palette. They are trying hard to be \"different\".  So if you want to enjoy Kasa Moto, round up a group of friends, make sure they are 30 something and one of them has a Ferrari and a huge expense account. I have no doubt that the rooftop patio is in full swing like South Beach and the bottles are flowing in the VIP, however as a restaurant it lacks and this ain't the Delano Hotel. I can't imagine why anyone with that kind of money to spend would not be at One across the road, or at Miku if they really like high-end Japanese food."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, fantastic ambience, great food. I found that the wait staff were very attentive and detail oriented. They were patient and took time to explain menu items and come check in on many occasions. The venue is definitely more upscale and posh (Yorkville). I would classify it more as a Japanese dining lounge than a Japanese restaurant.   I've seen a number of these venues in Chicago (Tundra, Roka Akor) during my time there, but I still find it hard to describe/classify the type of restaurant.  The Eats: - Smoked Salmon (smoked cream cheese, salmon caviar & yuzu butter) - Rock Shrimp Tempura - Kamameshi (wild mushrooms, burdock root, yam cake & truffle soy butter) - Shishito Peppers - Whole Grilled Sea Bass - O-Toro and Uni sushi   The majority of menu items were delicious. We were less than impressed with their sushi offering (avoid it, in my opinion). The kamameshi was particularly good - resembling a risotto dish.  We had our share of cocktails and beers and teas too - nothing particularly memorable from those items."}
{"text":"Food was ok, took over an hour for the first dish to arrive. Paid over 150$ and left hungry and pissed"}
{"text":"WOW!! This place was absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary together. As soon as we stepped foot inside the door, the SERVICE WAS AMAZING. Our server (Dan) was super kind and very knowledgeable of each dish and item we should choose on the menu. The WAGYU SKIRT was exceptional, the kamameshi rice was to die for and the rock shrimp tempura was unreal. I would recommend sharing a bunch of dishes so you can try as much as possible. The service was sooo good that they even gave us a free dessert! I cannot wait until next year to go back and visit!"}

{"text":"Love this place!  Had a nice lunch out on their beautiful rooftop patio.  Refined fusion Japanese cuisine with a twist.   The foods I ordered tasted original and unique to its own name.   Service was impeccable as the waitress who served us was energetic and seems to know the menu thoroughly - which I love!  Always checking up on us and have a nice genuine cheerful smile on her face.   It's not often you can that type of service in Yorkville.   Yes, it's a little pricey, but for the area and the quality of foods you're getting, it's definitely worth the splurge.   Coming back to try their wagyu beef!    What I had:  Broccoli Tempura:  waitress recommended and surprisingly good ~ batter was light and definitely did not feel greasy after consuming.  Enoki mushrooms + other mushrooms:  soooo good!  Just order it.   Myriad of flavours mixed together with greens on the bottom.  So uniquely and nicely done.  Beef soy bean butter fried rice:  too oily and garlicky for my taste - but maybe I am a little biased since I am Chinese and well, we do make one heck of a good fried rice in our restaurants.  Lol.  Cod:  So good and so beautifully presented, but oh-so-pricey for two pieces.  Still love it and would order again.   I believe they marinated it with some sort of alcohol?  Either way, the cod was cooked to perfection!    Beautiful ambiance, great service, quality uniquely prepared foods.   Can't go wrong with Kasa Moto if you're looking for a new Japanese joint to hit up in the area."}
{"text":"Kasa Moto has some pretty mixed reviews here, and I'm sure some bad experiences have been had (as with anywhere), but my experience was stellar and remains the best meal I've ever had.  Our dinner consisted of Soba Noodles (green tea noodles), Edamame, Chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), Kasa Moto Maki, Soft Shell Crab Maki, and Whole Grilled Sea Bass. All of this was beyond phenomenal, although it was a bit larger than we'd anticipated, so in retrospect I'd probably drop the Soft Shell Crab Maki. We also had two cocktails (can't remember the names) which were equally delicious.  The service was just right, with our waiter being very attentive and helpful without toeing into the \"okay, leave us alone now\" territory. The restaurant itself has a great feel to it, a sort of relaxed formal where everyone's at ease in a nice-looking place.  There's an abundance of fantastic eating options in the area, and I'd rank Kasa Moto toward the top."}
{"text":"Upon arriving we were taken to the upstairs patio where we had made our reservation. There were about 20-30 square tables, each with an umbrella over it- which came in handy later in the evening when there was a bit of a light rain. There was also a bar area that had a handful of people standing around it sharing drinks and a Robatayaki grill off to the side. We ordered nine dishes between the four of us, which wasn't as filling as I would have hoped.  Goma-Ae ($8): creamy, hint of sesame, great presentation, good portion size.  Tuna Tataki ($19): creatively served on top of a daikon radish, one bite pieces that blend together in a medley of quality tuna sashimi and a light ponzu sauce, sweet, a bit crunchy from the vegetable combined with the melt in your mouth texture of the tuna.  Soba Noodle Salad ($11): very very creamy, thin stringy carrots mixed in with the green tea infused soba noodles. Was tasty but nothing special.  Wagyu Beef ($15): sweet, very tender, a bit of fat, excellent glaze that helps bring out the flavour of the beef without overwhelming it, fairly small portion but otherwise not at all disappointing.  Rock Shrimp Tempura ($16): very very creamy, light batter, a bit spicy but just enough to notice not too much- added a bit of tang, sweet, good portion size.  Kinoko Salad ($13): a variety of wild mushrooms which make up most of the dish and have a salty and slightly sweet taste, heavy garnish.  Kasa Moto Roll ($22): Worth a try at least, their one and only attempt at a unique roll on the menu (still not very special), rice was a bit mushy, melted in your mouth- good medley of flavours, small portion.  Spicy Tuna Maki ($12): Nothing special, mushy blend of spicy tuna, very small pieces of maki, mushy rice, was disappointed- have had better spicy tuna maki at cheap AYCE sushi places.  Chicken \"Two Ways\" Futatsu No Aji De ($22): first way was small piece of chicken surrounded by dry flaky breading- could barely taste the chicken, interesting looking but not very tasty. Second way was medium sized cubes of chicken in very creamy sauce with a hint of spice, bad blend of flavours, chicken was a bit mushy. Good portion size.  Kasa Moto is a great restaurant to go to if you want to be served some unique dishes that are often more fun to look at than they are to taste. While it does have some unique and flavourful interpretations of dishes it depends heavily on cream and a lot of garnish which at times can overshadow the rest of the dish. The sushi is far from creative with only one unique item (the Kasa Moto roll). Furthermore, sushi prices were absurd and the quality did not help me forget that.  The service was excellent and lightning fast. The dishes were brought one at a time with little to no time in between so we were never left waiting. Staff members were all very knowledgeable and well informed on all the dishes and drink options.  You hardly get any bang for your buck but its worth a try for their robata menu items and if you enjoy a good presentation with your meal. The service made the experience very pleasant despite the shortcomings of some of the dishes. Not a good place for sushi so stick to their other menu items or go somewhere else if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Had very high expectations going to Kasa Moto and i definitely wasn't disappointed!  The service was awesome. The decor was ok inside the restaurant, not as sleek as I thought it would be. The patio was amazing, huge and lots of bar space.  We had the spicy tuna roll, beef carpaccio and the waygu beef skewers, all fantastic.    Make sure you make reservations well in advance as it gets booked up!"}
{"text":"Omg! Love their patio! Their food is good but love love their stone chocolate dessert with sesame paste, it was bomb! I'd definitely come back again. Service is great, very nice staff, very attentive. Great job on the patio, atmosphere very trendy, great for dates or a nice get together with friends."}
{"text":"I went to Kasa Moto for a friend's birthday last night and it was only a group of three. Gorgeous rooftop patio and space. The food was just okay - lobster slaw, kasa moto maki, sashimi, black cod, mochi dessert, and the chocolate dessert. All of the food items would be pretty standard quality for any other Japanese restaurant but pricier, nothing memorable.    My biggest complaint was the service. The waiter we had was a young guy who seemed more like a bus boy. As it was someone's birthday, one of the girls brought her a cake. They had given it to one of the servers when they entered. After finishing our ordered dessert, we asked our waiter if he could get the cake. After 15 min, still nothing so we reminded him again. Turns out he forgot. When he finally brought it back, he places the box on the table without anything else. The whole point was to have the cake with her for her birthday. We asked him for plates and he responded with \"i don't know if that is allowed. Let me check\" I get that you dont want people to bring their own desserts but we ordered dessert on the menu in addition to several drinks per person. It was obvious that it was a special occasion. The server after several minutes returned and said it was okay, had to ask if we needed forks - again, isn't that obvious?! And he wanted to make it clear that they would normally charge a plating fee but graciously would not this time - communicated in an annoyed tone.  None of this was communicated at the start of the seating when we brought them the cake.  The restaurant was clearing out at that point so we weren't hold up a table. Overall attitude was terrible and not condusive to providing a great night for our birthday girl!"}
{"text":"Great patio in yorkville.  The food is okay but I like the rooftop atmosphere especially in the summer.  We got kobe beef that you can cook on a hot stone and tempera - both were good but not mind blowing"}
{"text":"The food is okay. I tend to be more of a return customer for the atmosphere more than the food. Spicy tuna on crispy rice is definitely a favourite. The rooftop patio is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"A little underwhelming.  The miso soup very bland, the sushi average as best.  In fact this is not well prepared rice.  Other flavours all over the place.  Who put romaine lettuce in a sushi roll.  Oops, I know Casa Moto.  Would not go back.  So many better places in the city.  On the plus side, the service is great.  Also do not serve warm beer."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks.   At the end of the day however, you're paying the rent in food prices. So if you don't mind that, then it's a good experience."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for another of my birthday dinners/Winterlicious. The location and the decor was great. Seating had ample room, and it was sufficiently \"cool\" to be there.   However, the food was just so-so. We had the salmon tataki, arctic char, and some sort of brownie dessert. Salmon tataki was quite yummy with its fried kale, but sliced so thinly. The arctic char was interesting with its bacon and sweet potato addition, however tasted very Westernized and a little heavy for a fish dish. The brownie was a brownie. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was nice enough.  Let's see. The service was good. The wait staff was friendly, but forgetful. I would go back, but I hope that their future menu increases with more choices."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner reservations for a party of 11. First off, tone of the server set the mood: bad, monotone and hardly was ever there to get us even second round drinks, let alone a tea for my friend who had ordered over 30 mins ago.  The food was nothing spectacular or interesting. If you have not had Japanese food before, maybe, you would think it was good. Additionally, food took a long time, which is fine as it was a Friday night. But, once we cancelled our order, we received the food almost immediately packed up.  Yet, I must admit their dessert is good. After asking the server what we could do for a birthday dessert, he didn't offer any special accommodations to do something special on a dessert for us. A candle? Anything really... He did end up bringing out a dessert after a friend at the other end of the table asked for it....   Altogether, I would not recommend this place unless you want to be seen and receive mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Red tuna and hamachi Sashimi is amazing, wagyu was cooked perfectly however a bit salty, comfortable ambiance and great for get togethers"}
{"text":"The Wagyu beef was a hot stone was great and interesting. Everything was good but way over priced. $60+tax+tips for 15 pcs of sashimi? I don't know. I have tried better sashimi for a much lower price. Environment and atmosphere were not bad."}
{"text":"Just got back from there n wondering if they are using summerlicious to persuade us not to come back again.The only one thing could match up with their price was the service."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory dinner with coworkers and got to try a bunch of items on their menu.   Overall - the food is decent but at the prices you're paying, you could find so many comparable if not better places.   I didn't have anything mind blowing or fantastic so nothing on the menu really justified the prices for me. I left pretty disappointed but I guess that's the cost of dining in Yorkville.  If you're really confined by distance, then Kasa Moto is not a bad option for a restaurant with nice ambience and decent sushi / asian cuisine options. Otherwise, go elsewhere.   I probably wouldn't come back here specially to dine, but have heard good things about their patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Within the ten dishes we ordered, only the mushroom rice with truffle and black cod are memorable"}
{"text":"Kasa Moto is often frequented by my boyfriend and I. It's more of a fusion type restaurant vs an actual sushi bar, with a comfy lounge vibe. The dimly lighted ambience is perfect for a date night. In the summer, the patio is open to enjoy dining al fresco.   In terms of food, their chicken karaage, wagyu beef sliders, and salmon poke with crispy rice cake are all excellent. In addition, their wide selection of fresh sashimi is impressive."}
{"text":"4.5 stars - Really wanted to give it 5 stars but the hostess was not being very helpful at first when we wanted to change table as the sun was really beaming at us.  There were large patio umbrellas but our table had a section that was uncovered.  She did make an effort later by offering another spot but first impression is everything.  Lunch was only served on the rooftop terrace which was very spacious and comfortable with a modern and contemporary design.  This was a work event yesterday which started in the morning at the Stillwater Spa at Park Hyatt.  If you are ever planning a work event, you should consider a spa and lunch.  We all loved it!  And coming to a beautiful patio lunch at Kasa Moto was a really nice way to finish it off.  It was definitely 5 stars for the food.  We started with a few appetizers for sharing.    It was good portions so enough to go around for 8 people.  We had the haidacore ceviche, chIcken karaage which were my two favorite app dishes.  We also had edamame, rock shrimp tempura, and sashimi for sharing.  I also got the grilled sea bass which was cooked perfectly and the tangy sauce that was served with it was delicious.  There was only one dish, the beef carpaccio that my colleagues weren't too fond of.  Overall, the service was good despite the initial table issue, the food was fabulous and a beautiful place to dine.  Note also that prices are on the higher side.  I'll definitely be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This is truly an exceptional concept in a fantastic A-list location.  Clearly the owners have spared little expense in order to create an exceptional product.  Unfortunately it is still struggling with basic execution.  After making it past the Terroni-style kerfuffle at reception being told that our table was ready and then not ready followed by \"Please wait,\" we made our own way to the bar and asked for a food menu.  Then after ordering Sapporo and waiting 10 minutes because the bar keg wasn't pouring properly we managed to order a couple of appetizers.  Then after receiving the wrong appetizers not once but twice we finally threw in the towel and decided to leave.  Great concept--poor execution.  Based on our limited experience the food was pretty good however."}
{"text":"One would have high expectations for coming to dine at one of the restaurants under the Chase group. It's true! There's a standard to uphold.  Food wise, there's no disappointment truly. From how it was served to the presentation on the plate and services, you would have to applaud this upscale Japanese restaurant in Yorkville.   The only minor observation was a chipped teacup that was used. Not very observant of the waitress before bringing it out and serving the teacups. We would eventually had to voice òut our concern for the chipped teacup to be changed, before she would quickly apologise and proceeded to the switch.   Food is good and definitely fresh top grade sushi & sashimi. Ambience? It's surprisingly quiet with it packed and filled with people during dinnertime."}
{"text":"I read somewhere this place was like the Nobu of Toronto. We went here with resos on Friday night, the service was great. We asked to be sat near a TV  to watch the Raptors game while we dined and they arranged it for us upstairs. It was very busy there and the interior and presentation was great. The food on the other hand....  We ordered:  Rock Shrimp Tempura - overall this dish was a flavorless and airy inside (small pieces of shrimp). There was a hint of citrus flavor I tasted after.   The Sticky Fried Rice Spicy Tuna Sushi- Only 4 small pieces of sushi, the fried rice part was nice and crisp but I felt the Spicy Tuna didn't compliment the rice too well. The flavors just didn't blend well together.  The Karaage Chicken- my least favorite dish of the night, the chicken had a nice crisp to it but the sauces on the chicken totally killed the dish. There were few different types of sauces, the brown one was extremely salty while the white and orange sauce was over powered by the brown one throughout the whole dish. I was really disappointed, literally forced ourselves eat it because we were starving.  The Kasa Moto Roll- This roll had scallops, salmon and lobster in it yet I couldn't taste any of them in the roll. It was a fairly small roll and as I ate it I found that the texture of the roll was just mush, no crisp or freshness to it at all.  The Sea Bass- This was the only dish that we thoroughly enjoyed. great grilled sea bass with grilled lemon to squeeze and a sauce on the side which I think had bit of horseradish in it. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. We realized at the end of our meal we should've maybe each got the sea bass and a some wine.   We also had a mixed cocktail and a glass of wine, the bill came up to $145 (soooo overpriced and under satisfied), we tipped $20  and left...and will probably never go back. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things but I think to say 4/5 items being a disappointment...its best we don't go back."}
{"text":"Everything about Kasa Moto is perfect. Almost too perfect. Their interior and atmosphere is loungy, and sophisticated, but you wouldnt feel out of place wearing jeans and a tshirt. Their service is excellent, and all their servers seem to be very well educated on all the items on their menus! The food at Kasa Moto is like a hot knife cutting through butter. It's soo delicious. I honestly don't know how else to describe it. It's just simply so so so good. If it didn't cost me $70-$200 a meal, I would have it more often."}
{"text":"Sat and waited for a server for over ten minutes yet had three servers walk by and not say a word to us. Worst service ever. You can't charge that price for food and not have amazing service. We decided to get up and leave since nobody was willing to take our order.. won't be back."}
{"text":"SNOBS! All THREE of the hostesses were completely rude and stuck up. I stopped in for a drink and a bit of sushi and was met with three rude women who treated me like I didn't have any business in breathing the same air as them. I was brushed aside and I left quietly. I've never been treated so badly in all my travels."}
{"text":"You absolutely must come here for weekend brunch. I've been here for dinner which was really good but their brunch is hands down my favourite in Toronto. I come here with my cousin and we always order the pork belly skewers, soy butter fried rice, pork belly and sweet potato hash and the buckwheat buttermilk pancakes. The buckwheat buttermilk pancakes are much better than the blueberry pancakes from Mildred's Temple Kitchen imo and cheaper (I think) - $12. The pancakes are fluffy, enormous, drowned in maple syrup with a huge slab of butter on top and just so, so indulgent. In total our bill always comes out to around $56 not including taxes which is super reasonable for 4 dishes + coffee. Come here."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 7pm. We were right on time but were told that our table wasn't ready yet and instructed by 3 hostesses standing at the entrance to go find a spot at the bar to wait. We walk in and there's no room at the bar so we walk back and let the hostesses know. They insisted there must be room and to go check again. None of them offered to walk us over even though the 3 of them were just standing there with nothing to do. We were already annoyed at that point.   We wait for a few minutes and see the people that were finishing up at our table finally get up and leave. However we saw another guest at a high table ask to be seated at our table instead because the sun was hitting them. I watched several servers asking each other back and forth in confusion whether they could move them and then they began moving these other guests over to our table.  At that point, we decided to leave. It was a clear foreshadowing of the service we would've expected to get for the rest of the evening.   The decor and ambiance just reminded me of a fancier cactus club. Doubtful that $20 nigiri would've been worth the price. I'd pay that sort of price for an actual omakase, not a pretentious cactus trying to do Asian food."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to come here with a work colleague. I saw a few of the others posts and I think a they highlight a common theme - great atmosphere, great service, OK food.   The patio is very nice and the ambience is great if you were on a date or out in the evening with friends, wanting to be somewhere trendy & lively. Let's call a spade a spade... the staff are very attractive, well dressed, good attitude with great service - for the crowd they want to attract, this is important.   Now for the food. Was not overly impressed. I lived in Japan for 7 years and none of the dishes that were prepared were overly authentic nor stood out against similar competition in Toronto. In fact, I much prefer to eat a Avocado sushi on Bay street if we are only taking into consideration the food quality.   With that said, this is in the middle of Yorkville and is a great hangout spot. Will come back with colleague/friends, but won't be my main sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"\"...I didn't expect fish to be as beautifully cooked as the Miso Black Cod ($43). Ever since Nobu, no splashy Asian fusion restaurant is complete without some version of this dish. Priced on the steep side like everything else, the snow white fish was served with a sweet potato and squash puree that my guest practically licked from the plate. Mon Dieu! Goma-ae green beans and scallions decorated the fish centerpiece and the glistening miso glaze added the perfect amount of sweetness. This was the dish that eliminated any doubt that Kasa Moto's kitchen had refined skill. Compliments to executive chef Michael Parubocki and his team.\""}
{"text":"Not very impressed with Kasa Moto. The food is just okay and it's super expensive. It's a beautiful venue and has a great outside patio. But I wouldn't recommend this place for anything but a few patio drinks and an appetizer."}
{"text":"It was a great time, enjoying a glass of wine with my friend, and eating lobster sushi in Kasa Moto lounge. The atmosphere is so warm and the customer service is upscale. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Freshened up patio with great wait staffs. That's about it.   If you are looking for a culinary experience, you are about to find another low quality food with big price tag.   I ordered:  Kasa Moto burger- are you for real? Even street burger place can make the burger better than your 20$-something dollar burger.   Kasa Moto Roll- are you for real? Even a take out sushi place can make the roll better than your 20$-something dollar sushi roll.   Kasa wagyu beef robata- I think local Korean galbi place can make this thing taste better.   Kasa Moto sangria = orange juice.   Soybean beef fried rice- honestly. Now, even I can make this better than you....   Overall, quite disappointment for the hype this place had on the website."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner experience here. Unfortunately, today was sweltering hot outside so we did not eat out on the patio, but the ambiance inside the restaurant is very nice as well! Dim lights, soothing music, modern/asian decor, and very comfy seating all add to a pleasant dining experience!   My friend and I did not plan on dining out today but stumbled upon this place while exploring yorkville and kind of accidentally ended up inside. We were definitely not dressed for the occasion and felt like we should run out immediately, but we were greeted very kindly at the door despite our streetwear and served like the finest guests during our stay. I wish i had gotten our waiter's name because he was fabulous! We never ran out of water, he conversed with us, gave us great recommendations, and made sure our dining experience was perfect.   Everything here is made to share so get ready to order a bunch (like dim sum style). My friend and I being two fairly small girls devoured 4 dishes and reached a happy fullness.   We ordered a spicy tuna maki, soba noodles light, edamame, and pork belly. The spicy tuna maki was easily among the best sushi I have had in a while. Perfectly seasoned and even covered in something crunchy that just gave it that little extra oomph! I savored every single bite of it. This was my first time having soba noodles but as a first experience it was fantastic! The green tea noodles covered in white miso was so cool and refreshing. It was perfect on this hot day. It normally comes with cashews as well but since we told our waiter that we had nut allergies when he first sat us down, he remembered not to include nuts in any of our orders! Really great attention to details. The edamame was a little spicy for me but im pretty weak to spiciness. My friend loved it and the spicy hoisin sauce that came with it was very good as well. Finally the pork belly was so soft and delicious that i am salivating simply thinking about it.   Prices are a bit high for us on the college student budget but it was totally worth it today. I definitely recommend this place for good food and good ambiance!"}
{"text":"I was first served to an important employee meeting that was all about being kind to the guests and making them feel welcome - I guess they forgot about me, because I did not feel welcome. The staff of Kasa Moto brought me to this tiny corner table overlooking the bar where I could hear the conversations of every single employee. Although I requested a table by the window when I made my reservation on Open Table, the restaurant clearly ignored my request. Eating alone does not seem to grant you the privilege of deciding where you are sitting. I tried to sit at a middle table, but the hostess strongly pointed me to the corner table instead. At least the service was not as merciless: the waiter was very sympathetic and well trained. He would come around very often to ask me if all was good. Another waitress kept coming with water, never letting my glass turn empty. However, I still felt pressured. Two minutes after I ordered my food, it arrived. A hostess holding an iPad kept passing by my table, smiling, looking at my food. She obviously wanted my table, even though the restaurant was empty. I had a reservation and I was a guest like everybody else, yet I still felt like I was treated differently because of my singleness - which is not the best thing to do if you want the guest to feel welcome.  Nevertheless, Kasa Moto holds an impeccable design and décor -- it is quite the elegant and fancy environment. As for its food, it is arguably one of the best sushi places in Toronto. Before turning vegan, I would always go with friends and family because the place reminded me of how much I loved sushi and Japanese food. Tonight, was no exception. The food was undeniably incredible. Vegan or not, the restaurant does not let you down in terms of taste and pleasure. I was first treated to a crispy tofu platter which had a sophisticated presentation. The tofu was also soft and tender; it melted at the back of your mouth like no other tofu I've ever had. After my last bite, some unguided busboy crept in on my plate and asked if I was finished, I was not. There were still a bunch of vegetables and sauce on my plate. He kept passing by all through the night, hungry to take my plates, even when there weren't any on the table. I then ordered the garlic gai lan, which, according to the menu, was supposed to be a chili, it was not. It was in fact a bunch of green leaves and vegetables bathing in oil and garlic. I still devoured the plate like some hungry bear. Then, two minutes later, came the \"plat de resistance\": the vegan tempura. I was also expecting something different here, maybe a sweet potato tempura or avocado sushi, but they knew better. They instead created this new sushi filled \"heirloom carrots, squash, avocado & inari\" which ended up being the perfect combination for a vegan plate. I only wish they would create more vegan options, but one can only dream. In fact, this time around they had a new menu on their hands -- one that did not include my favorite vegan meal to have at Kasa Moto (which was garlic noodles). They also took the vegan symbol away from the miso soup (their soy now contains animal product). Additionally, the waiter was not able to offer me a vegan dessert, beside a platter of fruit, which I did not take. When a restaurant offers vegan options on the menu, one would think they would offer a proper vegan dessert. This, of course, made me feel even more alone. Maybe I should have gone to a vegan restaurant but to get vegan sushi in this city, there are only a few places you can go and Kasa Moto is one of them. Nevertheless, I asked for another glass of Pinot Noir to resolve my state of discontent and it helped make my night all the better."}
{"text":"Absolutely by far the best sushi I Have had in Toronto the three months I have been living here from Nyc. I love the rooftop setting area and the tuna roll is very tasty as well as the steak.  A must if in yorkville and looking for sushi to eat plus other great items."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Had the sushi and it was nothing special, presentation or taste wise. Server was OK brought us the bill without us asking for it, I hate that. I could have still ordered a coffee or something."}
{"text":"I love coming during the summer when you can grab a drink on the rooftop while a live dj is spinning.  The food is also great.  Overall, great experience"}
{"text":"Skip this place. The hostess was incredibly rude when I walked in. She asked if i had a reservation i told her no i was meeting someone who was already there. She asked her name, I said you wouldn't know her name if we didn't have a reservation. She then said do you know where she's sitting, how could I possibly know that? I said sorry, I've never been here. She started walking and said well, this is a huge restaurant so... The food was sub par at best. For this price point I expect incredible food. It wasn't. The cocktail it's time for Yoishi? Was great. Rock shrimp was meh. Tuna poke was also meh. Our server abandoned us for 25 minutes I had to ask a bus boy to bring my bill. They checked my friends coat, brought her the wrong coat 3 times, then finally asked her what hers looked like, then invited her back to find her own coat. This place is disorganized and not worth the price point. Two stars for the decor and the nice cocktail."}
