{"text":"The Food Truck Court seriously makes me very proud to have lived in Gilbert. This place is hopping with great food and lots of people. In the summer, the nights are hot and the business is slow, but during the cooler months, this place is packed with life. The sense of community is definitely strong. Pets, families, and people of all backgrounds come together to enjoy some really tasty foods. I myself have only tried a dozen or so different trucks in the last few months, but I am nearly always perfectly satisfied. Music is always playing, usually by the same fellow with a guitar. While a lot of the songs are repeated from week to week, it is really nice to get to hear some classic covers while I feast.   If you haven't had a chance to try this place out, I would recommend coming in something comfortable. Close-toed shoes are definitely a plus here, as there is no pavement. If you need to sit, you might want to consider bringing your own folding chair. Or, if you're young and spry, go ahead and plop down on the curb behind the food trucks with the other groups of people. There are normally plenty of seats, but they often get filled fast. There is never any trash lying around so you don't have to worry about your pets or kids playing with things they shouldn't. There are also plenty of tents and booths that aren't just food. Come on over and try it out sometime. You're going to have a blast."}
{"text":"The evening we were there there were about 10 food trucks. None were very appetizing but we tried to rob them. Neither was anything to write home about even the one had won first place in food truck food. Can I say that? Regarding the music, the music was worth it just to hear a very talented musician."}
{"text":"Food truck court was closed last fall. No new location has been announced."}
{"text":"Fridays are usually a treat! Just a short drive from our flat and to the Sam's Club plaza on the North East side of Gilbert and Houston.  A wonderful place where deliciousness congregates. I am talking about Food Trucks of varying dishes that can satisfy virtually everyone.   There's plenty of seats + tables to enjoy fam time, and of course the food. Live music is a bonus!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Lots of food options. Great for families and people of all ages. The food is a bit over priced for the types of food you're eating but the experience and the ambience is worth it. They have live music and are pet friendly! I definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants to do something different for dinner on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"This is a fun Friday night option. Everyone can get food from the truck they like and you still get to eat together. All the trucks I've been to take credit cards too. A meal and drink at most trucks has run me about $10. Most options are pretty unhealthy, but once in awhile is ok!   I have found it easier to park a block or 2 west of the event, near the train tracks. Seating can be a problem too. Lots of people bring camping chairs. I usually just crowd in at a table or find a curb to sit on. I don't usually go that much after it gets over 100 degrees out though!   Recently there have been merchandise vendors there too. I bought some lotion and soap from a local farm."}
{"text":"Great reviews:  https://www.facebook.com/gilbertfoodcourt/info  http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2015/03/best_things_eat_drink_phoenix_march_13.php   http://mouthbysouthwest.com/2015/03/11/gilbert-food-truck-food-court-to-have-30-trucks-for-grand-opening-of-new-site-friday/  from their website:    Do you remember that one EPIC party from high school? The one everyone is still talking about a decade or two later at the reunion? The one that started with a handful of people being invited and somehow 3 whole schools show up and there isn't enough food or room for people, the police show up to deal with the cars on the road and everyone who is anyone is there - even the MAYOR? Well last night the Grand Opening was exactly that!! And it was EPIC!! On behalf of the all the truckers, we humbly offer a huge THANK YOU to all that braved the traffic and crowds. It was an adventure - we had no idea it would be such a huge hit! We are constantly watching, listening and thinking of ways to improve this event. We had an awesome night last night and can't wait to make this week even better than the last! SEE YOU FRIDAY, GILBERT!!"}
{"text":"Boy, has the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court grown! Long gone is the original location (a parking lot that was replaced by the delightful Zinburger, Lolo's and soon Pomo Pizzeria Napolentana). They out grew the small lot across the street from Oregano's. The weekly meeting of food trucks and vendors is so massive now that it is currently in a huge dirt lot (it was rocky so wearing sneakers is highly recommended over flip flips - you will thank me later) across from Barrio Queen, right next to the canal (if you are a bike rider, you'll love it).   There is live music, at least 10 different food trucks, beautiful sunsets and still never enough chairs or tables. I suggest you just bring your own chairs to avoid that problem or take your food to-go. Trucks like the Superfarm Superfood, Bang Bang Dumpling and at least one BBQ truck are always there.   Trucks do vary from week to week but you can check the who is on the weekly rotation on their fb page. I've had everything from The Maine Lobster Lady (crazy longline everytime so you know they are doing something right) to Waffle Love (also, one of the longer lines but they have a stamp card!) to SugarHi, a booth that sells interesting flavored cotton candy!   So instead of paying a cover fee to go to some food truck festival, just head on out to downtown Gilbert because there is a food truck party every Friday night."}
{"text":"This was a fun Friday night. Who knew downtown Gilbert was so full of life and the great thing is that I see even more potential!!  I think there were 20+ trucks this Friday but it was a fluke rain storm until 5pm. There were 3 places to get burritos. My kids liked our choice which was a dull white truck not as crowded as Queso or another. But it was right next to Cousins lobster truck. This was melt-in-your-mouth delicious but portion wise, I think it was an appetizer. Also had 2 waffle trucks. I missed some Asian choices and they were listed but didn't show. I'd suggest more tables. Some people brought chairs but that's not me...so, add some chairs, a few more trucks and I give a 5"}
{"text":"This food truck court showcases a great variety of different foods, such as lobster rolls, fry bread, and Belgian waffles. They also have a few vendors that sell clothes and jewelry. The real negative here is that it was REALLY hot outside even towards the start of the evening which should be pretty obvious given that it's Arizona in the summer, but it would have been nice to have more seating options, and more seating options that are shaded."}
{"text":"Very noisy. Smells of exhaust and burning propane. No where to sit. Expensive. Food just OK.    I got a \"Po-Boy\" BBQ sandwich. $14. It was a GIANT roll, smothered in aioli (mayo), had some lettuce and tasteless tomato. Oh and there was about 4 slices of brisket in there too. Came with a very small side of coleslaw that was Mehhh.. $2 for a bottle of water  My daughter got some fancy teriyaki bowl that was $9 mostly rice and veggies. Had about 10 pieces of chicken in. She didn't like it. $2 for water  The wife and other kid got quesadillas. They were big and good, I think they were about $9 each. It was a long line and took a long time to get the food, probably about 30 minutes or more.  I don't recommend you take kids here. There's not a lot of kid friendly trucks. There was a hotdog place, so that's always good. But even the Mac-N-Cheese one truck had was all fancy with things in it. Kids don't (at least mine) like that stuff. No one had a \"kids meal\".   If you go, bring your own drinks. I would have brought my 100oz CamelBack if I thought about it. There's no bathrooms or water fountains either. Get your food, and then walk back to the water tower. It's quiet over there and there's some nice tables and chairs you can sit at and enjoy your food. Your kids can run around by the fountain.   Plan on spending $15 per person if you buy drinks or dessert. I don't think we're going back. I was let down, I guess I see these TV shows about food trucks and they all look so good, but the atmosphere killed it for me."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a fun experience.  I took my family and some friends there for the evening. I am a huge fan of downtown Gilbert, so I expected a super fun time.  It wasn't crowded but there was a decent amount of people. Tons of variety!  I had Bang  Bang Dumpling and thought it was good, but we waited 30 minutes for food. However, my family said that was fairly typical. My husband had a Nutella Waffle from the Chicken and Waffle Truck. Again, super good, but it took a real loooooonnnnnggg time to get (probably 40 minutes)  There were minor problems, I beleive the city needs to address (or the powers that be). There are not enough tables so be prepared to stand and eat. Also, there were no public bathrooms or port-o-potties. I can't imagine that is legal.  If they fixed those problems, I would be glad to give this event another star, but until ten, my cavets remain!"}
{"text":"If you dont have patience to wait then you will not like food trucks. I love food trucks! It is a different type of experience and they have variety types of food and dessert. I had ribs, wings, ice cream that was made from real milk in cows, burgers, and etc. I enjoyed it very much love trying new things!"}
{"text":"Dang, I should have read Chris H.'s amazingly detailed and informative review.  I wore heeled boots to the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court and man were my feet wobbling while walking on rocks [I can't even call this gravel because they were your average landscaping sized rocks].  Yeowch!  At least I burned off my food while trying to balance?  Anywho, this place is located right across from Barrio Queen.  At 6PM in November, the Barrio Queen actually looks like true royalty with her bright neon sign lighting the way to hungry patrons looking for a bite to eat.  There were 10+ trucks this particular Friday night, lots of people were in attendance to dine, and seating was a headache.  We managed to snag a table right next to The Maine Lobster Lady's food truck at the last second.  I wish I had known about this luck because I would have ordered the bisque!  Oh well.  Maybe next time.  Anyways, Gilbert Food Truck Food Court has a rotating guests of food trucks weekly so make sure you check to see if your fave truck is in attendance on their respective social medias.  As Chris said, why pay a cover fee for fancy food truck festivals when you can come here every Friday night?  Live music and chocolate stout cotton candy from Sugar Hi awaits you!"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy. I've always loved food truck festival and am glad that i didn't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for this one. We got there around 6p.m. when the sun was still up. It was definitely brutal waiting for food in that weather. Nevertheless, we didn't mind being outside for good food. As always, the first truck we went to was the one with the Lobster roll. They were very generous with the lobster meat and it was absolutely delicious. I have to say though...$17 was a bit pricy for a small roll. Other than this truck, there was also other food that you could choose from. I was a bit disappointed that they don't have too many trucks with small bites. The only one that i saw was the ice-cream truck. There was an amazing guitar player that was there since 6p.m. He played amazing music for hours and wish more people would have paid attention to him.   With the weather is still blazing hot and the limited choices in food truck, I'm not sure if i will come back here again. Overall, i think it was ok."}
