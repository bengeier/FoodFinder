{"text":"Frisch's is pretty reliable, family-friendly fare. Decent prices. I usually get a bacon burger. Their onion rings are above average. The salad bar actually seems like a pretty nice option, although I've never selected it. I have done the breakfast bar, which has a surprisingly nice selection. My inlaws seem to love the liver and onions, but I'm not quite prepared to go there myself."}
{"text":"Tony and I usually go here for Breakfast. We try not to be that typical older couple but we seem to be getting more and more into that pattern. Both in our mid 50s now, not 2 spring chickens any longer. We enjoy their breakfast menu but we are not into the whole buffet thing. Never got into those much because of germs and stuff. I usually go with the breakfast norms, nothing fancy.  I can't handle the sweets, hurts my belly. Sugars give me a headache. Tony on the other hand, waffles, pancakes, pastries...the works...but every now and then I sneak a bite or two."}
{"text":"From 12/24/12:  Get the Super Big Boy!  My siblings, husband and I (all from Texas) dined here a few times, while in town.  That delicious burger BLEW.  MY.  MIND.  We came here and ate that burger twice, even though we were there for less than a week."}
{"text":"Great service.  Unfortunately my wife's breakfast was cold.  Always hesitant to order off the menu at a buffet.  Ham was tasty in my omelet."}
{"text":"it's a big boy. it's white trash dining at it's finest."}
