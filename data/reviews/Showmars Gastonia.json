{"text":"Went back at lunch time. Very busy but we got our order in fast and got our food fast. First time back in a couple of months but a waitress remembered us and brought me mayo for my fries. She was not even our waitress, but remembered that I ate mayo on my fries. Good food, hot and quick. Need to go back more often not only for the food but the top notch service. Customer satisfaction is important here!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Showmars!!!  I have not been to this location  in years. My husband and I visited this location today.  This one did not compare to any of the other locations such as Charlotte,  Denver or even Shelby.  The service was not as friendly and efficient.  The food was not seasoned as well, nor my husband's as hot.   The restaurant is moving, new surroundings will be nice, but service and food prep will not improve with a new address. Like Showmars,  but not this location.  So, when having a Showmars craving, I will not be satisfying it at this location."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Showmars, but not this location!  The building looks old and dirty.  It doesn't compare to many other locations in have been to.  My Greek salad came out with nothing but white bitter pieces of iceberg lettuce...definitely not mixed greens of any kind.  When I asked for some green romaine lettuce the cook was Disturbed and threw up a plate that didn't have hardly any green lettuce on it. They do not offer whole wheat pita bread, they only offer white. The chicken even looked questionable.  This Showmars needs a lot of attention. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Cold food. Every single time. Mash potatoes and rice frigid. Asked for butter for my rice and they brought me an ice block of butter that would NEVER melt in my 37 degree rice. Had to use hot fry to melt butter, lol"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and got the real chicken salad in the tortilla. When I got home I was very shocked. Size of the salad was the size of a small side for $8 dollars I am very disappointed. The other showmars I have been to the salads is the size of a dinner plate I will not order salad place again"}
{"text":"Ooooooo my gosh!! Let me tell you about the hamburger pita!!! It's the bomb.com, the bees knees, the cats pajamas... It's really good.   I have I only gotten that, but it was GOOOOOD!! Staff was courteous, and quick.   Haven't dined in so can't really comment, but the hamburger pita is worth a stop In."}
