{"text":"Really yummy FOOD with great service at a great price. They have two style of asian food, Hakka (traditional Chinese food) and Thai. I asked the server for what they would recommend and server gave awesome recommendations.

I ordered Hot and Sour Soup and Loong Foong Soup they both tasted amazing and flavorful, not too spicy or too mild. They have a thai chili sauce so that is a perfect condiment with the food.

The #130 Thai Chicken was delicious as well. The chicken was well done and crispy. When combined with the thai sauce made it melt in your mouth good.

The # 157 Pad Thai was amazing as well.

Great food, definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great thai food with great service. By the way try out their Fried Banana with Ice Cream it a great dessert."}
{"text":"Best Halal Thai food you can find in GTA, I am sure you can find better places to sit, better places that offer too much, but not deliver. This place has the best pad thai and other dishes. The portions are big and the prices are quite satisfactory as well."}
{"text":"Just found accidentally an ideal place for great Thai food in Mississauga while driving to Toronto .  The place is clean and nicely decorated for family evening out for authentic Thai delicacy.  When you walk in the people there are warm and hospitable and make you feel welcomed. We ordered soup;
Tom yum Goong(Thai lemon Shrimp Soup)  Shrimp with;tasty
Gai Phad Kraphao(Basil Chicken) Stir fried chicken with garlic which was superb;  I tried Pad Thai
Rice noodles stir fried with spicy sweet sauce with chicken, shrimp, egg, tofu, carrots and topped with crushed peanuts which we'll prepared; and finally I tasted garlic fish which tasted the best.
      I will say this restaurant is the best secret for Thai delicacy. ..happy customer richard"}
{"text":"This one of the best restaurants we have been to , not trendy but the food quality , portions and taste is yummy 
Their Tom Yum Goon is the best we had so far and so is the Pad Thai 

Owners are very polite and cheerful 

Always a yes for family"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since it is close to the hotel we stayed at. We love Thai food & have it often. The food here lacked authentic Thai flavor that we are used to, but it wasn't bad, just not great Thai food."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp so we went over to check it out... disappointment... our server was great but her colleagues were not - they just wanted us out of the restaurant :( 

If you've had Downtown Thai Food and are looking for something that is comparable, this place is not the place to go to. We ordered the pad thai, yellow curry, green curry, platter - we were not impressed by any one of these."}
{"text":"We ordered Manchurian chowmein, chilli chicken, scezuan beef and a Thai dish.  All dishes were very good and we really enjoyed.  Will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Good Food and Friendly Service

Very friendly and helpful staff. Tasty stuff and all portions are quite large. Try the tom-yum soup."}
{"text":"I work for a company right around the corner of this place. My colleagues and I go here all the time for lunch. 

We noticed that the portions began to get smaller but we began to get more rice. 

Then we began to notice that the prices began to change. 

I just came back after ordering my usual Thai Shrimp that I used to be charged $11.93 with a drink. I am now being charged $13 flat without a drink. I brought this up to the people working there and they claimed that I must be forgetting the real price. 

I can tell you that this will be last time I visit here for lunch. I'm shocked actually that they would treat their everyday customers this way. My colleagues feel the same way.

Don't go here."}
{"text":"I like this place, its a nice cozy restaurant which serves Halal Hakka Chinese and Thai menu. I have been to place many many times and yet everything I go the service is always pleasant and friendly. The staff is happy to take the order and try to being the food quick and warm.

I have tried many of their dishes beef, chicken and fish and they were all cooked well and taste nice. I love their loong foong soup and my significant other always gets their Hot and sour soup both soups are great and I have also had their chicken corn soup which was decent as well. Their chilli chicken and beef were decent to enjoy.

The price points for the dishes are good as well and the portions are awesome as I always have left overs to take home (YAAY next day office lunch :D! check).

parking is not a problem as its part of a big plaza.

For my Muslim Brother and Sister - They serve halal meat"}
{"text":"I've been going to Chang & Huang for years now.  This place is in a strip mall where there are many restaurants including Afghan, Turkish, Japanese and other Halal type places.  Even the Popeye's that used to be there was Halal.  

That being said C&H has a nice variety on their menu separated for both Thai and Hakka menu items and they have in house specials if you order over a certain amount you get bonus like Chicken Pakora or rice or something like that

They have seating for maybe 40 or so as it's not a big dine in but they do take out too and if you have a party of 10 or more they can arrange the middle table to accommodate.  

The variety and pricing is very reasonable for the amount of food that you get.  Every time we've ever gone we are basically always sharing dishes.  A pad thai for instance is big enough for one if that is all you are eating.  If you get other dishes whether curry, thai spice, ginger, seseme etc the portion sizes are all consistent and paired with rice etc you get the picture... 

Starters that are good include the satay sticks, mango salad, cold rolls, fried rolls etc.

This place is very casual.  It's not fancy like say Green Mango in Bloor West but the food is very good for the value and the portions.  One time we went with a party of 10 or so and the entire bill was just over 100 dollars and we had lots to take home.  

I think our favorite dish is Thai chicken which is basically battered chicken in a sweet honey type sauce with chili peppers in the sauce.  Beware to not eat the entire red peppers as they almost look like berries!"}
{"text":"Used to work nearby about 22 years ago and used to be our favourite place to go for lunch, first because there was a limited selection and second it was reasonably priced. 

Returning there after a long time. For $10 inclusive of taxes, you get a choice of two sides from a salad, a veggie spring roll, a veggie soup or a sour pepper soup. Then for the mains you get a meat or a veggie dish with steamed rice. Seafood, Noodles or a Egg Fried Rice is extra. 

So amongst the four of us we had two sour pepper soups, a salad and vegetable soup. The sour pepper soup is good and nice balance or heat, sourness and seasonings. The salad is small but good and the veggie soup is downer. For a person who can't handle any spice the veggie soup is ideal, as it is not seasoned as well. 

We had for mains a veggie Manchurian with veggie balls, a spicy eggplant, a vegetable with cashews and a mushrooms in Manchurian sauce. 

The Manchurian was amazing, but the veggie balls have gotten smaller from earlier. The sauce had a perfect blend of garlic, spice and salt. Had the sauce cooked for a minute longer it would have been perfect consistency as it runny. The mushrooms in Manchurian sauce was perfect consistently and the
mushrooms delicious deep fried in batter and were gooey was a 5/5. The veggies with cashews was good as well. Lots of cashews on top to make it crunchy and sauce done well. The spicy eggplants were ordered extra spicy but came out not spicy even though there were a lot chillies added. The chillies were orange/red in colour indicating they had ripened and perhaps not as spicy as the chef intended it to be. 

The service quick and good. Enough water and tissues going around. One of the servers has been there since I first started to come and CnH Thai. Very little has changed since almost 2 decades. Now there are so many choices around. 

Still would recommend this to all my friends and family.

{"text":"I came here during a weekday and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't exactly excited by my meal either.  

I had the lunch combo, which included soup, spring roll, entrée and white rice.

Soup: Sour and Pepper soup. I think they purposely didn't call this Hot and Sour soup because that would mean the soup should be red be more hot than sour.  This \"Sour and Pepper\" soup was exactly what it sounded like. Sour with pepper.  Wouldn't order it again. 

Spring roll: This was delicious. Hot and piping and crispy.  Wished it came with some sauce though.  

Entrée (chili chicken dry): It was not bad.  Crispy, but maybe not hot enough.  

Verdict: If I'm close by and really want North American Chinese food or Hakka, I might drop by, but not sure I would drive more than 10 minutes to get here."}
{"text":"Authentic, no-frills. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised, especially with the Hakka style (Chnese and Indian) offerings. 

Resonably priced."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese/ Thai restaurant in whole Mississauga. There food quality and quantity is incomparable. Everyone here is super friendly. It's a small hidden treasure. Do try it out"}
{"text":"Sorry to say that the most important aspect of a restaurant, the food, is sorely lacking in this establishment. We ordered vegetable pakoras, chicken satay, beef in black bean sauce and thai golden curry chicken. Service was friendly and prompt. Our pakoras tasted store bought and resembled more of a falafel. Satays were over cooked, chewy and flavourless, especially the sauce. The portions on our mains were good, but both tasted like canned sauces. The golden curry was especially poor, I couldn't believe the potatoes were frozen hash browns! It tasted like condensed chicken soup and left us very unsatisfied. Some of the Hakka food looked good on other tables, and if you grew up with this style of fare, it might appeal to you. I was sorely disappointed and cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"I called in a few hours before eating here to ask when is a good time to arrive for iftaar to make sure I have my food in time. The lady said 15-20 minutes. I arrived 20 minutes before.

They advertised \"free iftaar\" with your meal. (a date and a few pakoras)

When it came time to open my fast, I didn't receive \"free iftaar\". I had to ask twice and ten minutes later (after obviously ignoring us) they provided it. Not a big deal considering that was free but my actual meal didn't come until 20 minutes after the fast opened. Had I known the service would be that slow I would have came earlier. Horrible customer service 

Food was average at best. I've had Thai food at countless restaurants and these guys definitely do not use coconut milk as a base. I ordered red curry, it tasted watery and nothing like red curry."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, and the food comes out with full portions, hot, and tasty! The Basil Chicken and Thai soups are stellar! The staff is extremely friendly and accommodation. I travel a lot and have Thai food everywhere I go. We ate here three days in a row!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok here.  Cheap ingredients for dishes they offer.

Their lo mien is made with spaghetti... so dont expect asian noodles here.

Its for a quick fix... but if you want standard dishes... and expect what is listed in their menu... you are expecting too much.

On a good note... their vegi spring rolls are quite good.

Employees have mentioned that thier spicy dishes are good... but i dont eat anything spicy... so I cant give you my personal review in thier spicy dishes."}
{"text":"I came here with a few colleagues for our usual Friday lunch outing a couple of weeks ago. It is located in a plaza with a ton of eateries. At this rate, our group will eat our way through this plaza by the end of the year.

This place offers both Thai and Hakka food choices. My toughest decision was which cuisine to try. I went with the latter.

There are lunch specials. I went with the one where you choose which dish you want from the main menu. You then choose two items from a spring roll, sour and pepper soup, vegetable soup, or a green salad. It comes with rice.

I ended up ordering chilli chicken with gravy. I also got a spring roll and vegetable soup. I upgraded to egg fried rice, which is an extra loonie.

I don't like a ton of peppery items. It was the main reason why I went with the vegetable soup. Well, there was tons of pepper in it. It was okay, but it wasn't anything to write home about.

The chilli chicken was good. I liked how tender the chicken was and the amount of gravy that you got. The downside was that I was expecting more spicy to it. It wasn't spicy at all. My vegetable soup had more kick than this dish.

The spring roll was deliciously crispy. With all the sauce that was left, I ended up dipping my remaining spring roll it in the sauce. Yum!

The highlight here was the egg fried rice. It is essentially a deluxe version of fried rice. It was excellent. Perhaps I will just order this dish next time and figure out what meat I'd like.

The staff were efficient and prompt. What I didn't like was our server pushing the sour and pepper soup on me after I had ordered the vegetable soup. Instead, my colleague sitting across from me caved and got it after originally wanting the salad. Luckily, she liked the soup.

I would like to come back and try the Thai dishes, along with other Hakka dishes that have more spice to them.

{"text":"Chang & Huang is a super simple Thai restaurant located near Dixie and Eglinton. The interior is nothing special but that is beside the point, I was here for some delicious lunch! 

On the table they featured a lunch special that included the choice of any chicken, beef or vegetable dish, a side of steamed rice and two choices from the following 4 options: sour and pepper soup, vegetable soup, vegetable roll and a green salad. All of this is for $8.75 plus tax! (pretty good deal eh?) 

I ordered the sesame chicken with the vegetable roll and the green salad. The sesame chicken tasted incredible and was a sizeable portion too. The salad was fresh and the vegetable roll and steamed rice was tasty as well. My colleague ordered the chicken pad thai which was easily some of the best pad thai I've tasted and he couldn't finish it! 

The servers were friendly and for the cost of the meal I was definitely left satisfied. With the wide variety of options on the menu I'll be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Avoided this place for a while, mostly coz i always see it empty. But i found some great reviews besides the yelp ones so i gave it a try today. Great food and reasonable price. The service was nice too. Had curry shrimp and loved it. Not a big fan of spicy-hot dishes so this one was just my taste:)
I think they are also great with take out so I will try that next time."}
