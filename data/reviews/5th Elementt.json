{"text":"Would have been perfect if full menu was available and heat was working properly. 

Came with a group of friends for winterlicous. Their heating wasn't working so we had to step over their space heaters to get to our table. It was pretty full considering it was a weekday evening. 

Server was very nice - she was attentive and patient. They had run out of a few things on their menu because she said they were very busy from the weekend so we had to make second choices.  They ran out of 2 appetizers, 1 main and 1 dessert so she had to stand there as we all re-read the menu to choose other things.

I had the shrimp app. Very good - big pieces. Salad could have used a bit more dressing. Butter chicken main was amazing. Tender chicken - I can't remember the last time I had such tender chicken at an Indian restaurant. The sauce was delicious - cleaned my plate with naan, which was freshly baked and soft. Rice pudding for dessert with gulab jamun. They put the gulab jamun into the rice pudding. I didn't like that, should have put it on the side.

My friends had the lamb, beef and mutton. All were raving about their food too. Did not disappoint!

Coming back here again next time so I can have my first choice - lobster and shrimp!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a strange non-restaurant feel to it. I can't quite put my finger on why, but it feels more like I am sitting in an office rather than a restaurant, not that the decor is not pleasant. Perhaps it is the lack of smoking oily food smells emanating from their kitchen, or maybe the unhurried calm way the servers handle themselves, ... their prices are good. I went there during summerlicious a few months ago and had a steak with a spicy sauce on rice that came with appetizer and dessert. Yeah, that's right, indian restaurant and I had a baseball steak...  Kulfi is an indian ice cream - very creamy vanilla pistachio with cardamom - beautiful in form and taste - was served with gulkand, a sweet preserve made with rose petals and sugar, both of which were new to me and it was fantastic! I hated the steak when I tasted it in the restaurant, but that kulfi and gulkand was totally unforgettable - alone worth the visit. The kulfi was made by the restaurant, not purchased from a store... First thing I did when I got home was look for a recipe for kulfi on the internet. As my training since birth forbade me to discard or waste food, I wrapped my steak to go and had it the next day on toasted swiss rye. Not bad."}
{"text":"The food was good. But I will never go back.

I originally met up with a friend to go to Ghandis. I'd heard lots of good things about Ghandis, but I was really not prepared for how tiny the dining area was. Nowhere to sit. :( So my friend and I walked a bit east and found this place called 5th Elementt. We really wanted Indian and they had lots of empty tables, so we went inside...

It's fairly nice inside, though if you look closely it's a little shoddy bit of decor, and the menu was a bit sparse, which made me wonder... was this show on Restaurant Makeover recently...?

About the menu... it was sparse and completely different from the menu posted on the outside of the restaurant that made us decide to come inside. The prices on the inside menu are higher, and the choices are fewer. The waiter said, \"oh, the menu on the outside is just our take-out menu.\" But we wanted the choices we saw on the takeout menu that weren't available on the inside menu... the waiter said we could have the items from the takeout menu, with a little snide comment, \"but they are from the takeout menu.\" He couldn't tell us the price until we got our bill... $3 more than the price on the menu. He didn't even come by our table at all to check in.

Sooooo pretentious. The food was actually tasty, but I've had better, cheaper, and larger portions. For $17 I could get a bigger entree somewhere else. Oh well, the company was good. But I shall never come back to this place and that snooty waiter."}
{"text":"Eat at your own risk!!

I lost my appetite for days after eating at this Restaurent. We had 3 course meal with the 2 person groupon and I didn't even mind the portions were terribly small. Few hours after we reached home from dinner my stomach was severely upset. I never experienced this much diarrhea in over a decade! I am a regular customer of groupon and I thought 39$ deal was worth to try. My advise is to stay away from this Restaurent if you don't want to suffer for hours on the toilet! I knew I was sick from this Restaurent cause I have brought my friend to dine with me that night and he was quite sick as well.

We came in and the server seated us right away. The atmosphere was so friendly because the Restaurent was so tiny inside. We started out by asking what drinks are available and the Indian server kept explaining of the drinks we never heard of. We ended up getting just two bottles of beers cause the drinks was so over priced.

The server was patient enough to explain the groupon to us. We started out with a mango salad and chicken tikka. If you want to know their portion sizes, you get this tiny salad with shreds of mango and 4 pieces of chicken. After we ate the appetizers I was quite upset because the server said the appetizers are supposed to be sharing sizes. 

Our main course came out quite fast and we got more rice than the two small bowls of curry they gave us. We got butter chicken and the taste I never experienced before, It had no flavour and tasted sour. We also ordered coconut fish curry as the other main course which was more disappointing than the butter chicken. By the time the deserts came out I had no more appetite because I already started to feel sick. 

I have never been scammed by groupon before and I can honestly say this is my first time. The food looked nothing like the pictures posted on the groupon and likewise for the taste. I felt cheated mainly by the taste wise than their portion sizes. It was definitely not worth getting sick. I certainly will not be coming back and hopefully no one should experience getting sick from eating their rotten food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on August 27, and will go back.

The food:  Started with the Mango and Clemintine Salad and the Vegetable Chatt.  The salad was good, but not fanastic - the dressing needed a little more work to make it stand out.  the chatt was, again, good, but not a real stand-out.

The main courses however, were very good.  I had the Tandoori Chicken, which was utterly perfect.  I'd go back for it in a heartbeat.  My partner had the Lamb Shank, which was also very good.

No desert.

And the naan is served generously - order 1 for two people, but will be plenty!

Service was good, but not exemplorary."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday. Wasn't opened but the website said it was open all days. Called in and the guy was very unapologetic and rude. Simply gave answers we're not opened...good luck. If that's the service I'm going to get and wasting my time to get here, then I'm never going back"}
{"text":"Good food..but small portions and a bit over priced....I'm torn. The lamb shank was small but very tasty. The shrimp pakora also flavourful. Prix fix menu is a good value and is your best bet."}
{"text":"Probably the worst I've ever had for dinner in the downtown area. 1 star is being generous. 

Took nearly twenty minutes for the appetizer to arrive (cauliflower and leek soup) and we asked for salt and pepper shakers and, even after leaving the restaurant, we're still waiting on it...

Ordered four main dishes and once they finally arrived they were cold and, for the most part, tasteless. One dish that we ordered (butter chicken) was closer to room temperature than being steaming hot like it should be served. I feel as if all they did to prepare this dish was open a jar of butter chicken base and mix in chicken used for kebabs!

Service was terrible to say the least. We constantly had to ask twice for any requests (water etc) and although they walked past our table several times, not once did they ask how the food was or if they could get us anything. 

Once we were done eating and asked for containers and the bill, I had more than enough time to walk down the street, grab coffee from a timmies (which was the best part of the meal) and walk back before the bill was settled.

Would not recommend and definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the Prix Fixe lunch. Yum Yum! Great value. $11.99 for 3 courses. I had the mango mandarin salad and the butter Chicken supreme which was excellent. The portions looks small on the giant plates but are definitely filling. I had to take my blueberry tart to go. Will be going back...soon. Looking forward to trying the other items on the menu, but it will be difficult not to order the butter chicken."}
{"text":"No, never again. We came on a Groupon coupon with a reservation on a Sunday night. The heating was obviously broken and four little heaters struggled to keep themselves warm.

Agonizingly slow service. One appetizer, one main dish and a prepared dessert took OVER two hours. The single waitress, nice as she was, allowed no walk-ins at all. Everyone without a reservation was asked to \"come back another night\" even though less than 1/3 of the tables were occupied. She must have know about their poor service - and said, 

\"This is quite normal for us, I am used to being stressed.\"

The food may have been good, but that pleasure was totally negated by the total slowness of service in the ice cold restaurant. (TWO HOURS) One couple didn't stay for the main dish, they left after about one hour.  We should have left earlier too.

The whole place screamed inattention. Broken and wiggly tables and chairs. Loose tape around the windy street front door, no paper of any kind in the men's bathroom and an abject lack of ventilation in the bathroom area. 

Yuck."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet - great. Tasty food, friendly service, reasonable pricing and all round nice environment. Will def come back here"}
{"text":"4.5  stars.

I have been to this resto 4 times now and it has not disappointed any of those times. The first 3 times was for dinner and today I went for the lunch buffet.

The buffet was excellent, the quality of the meat and the depth of flavours (without the  heaviness that often accompanies Indian food) were pleasantly surprising for buffet, which can often substitute quality for quantity.  A wide range of different dishes should satisfy most tastes, and there is a good selection of salads and desserts for those so inclined.  The fresh naan was lighter than air and not covered in oil as is often the case.

The service has always been nothing but courteous, professional and friendly.  I used deal coupons a couple of times and found them equally as cordial whether I was using coupons or not.  In my experience this is not always the case (see Indian Hut reviews!).

The only caveats (unrelated to the food and therefore do not really factor into my opinion, FOOD IS KING!!):

They need to do something about their signage, it's not good.
The door has a strange metal grate over it which gives it the impression of being closed and is therefore not very inviting.  Should be easily fixed and I think it will make a massive difference."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!



For someone like me, the thought of eating at an Indian restaurant on this part of Queen street, right next to the Velvet Underground, is a bit strange. To me, this is a dive area, and it should always be so. I always think of the Big Bop, Zoo bar West, and the Cameron House when I'm down here, so eating in a nice restaurant is far from my mind. Who am I to urban plan?

I was pleasantly surprised by 5th Elementt. It has a pleasant and large interior, with very clean washrooms. The service was polite and helpful. The food was very good, with excellent fresh naan bread.

They serve all the Indian standards: Biriyani, Garam Masala Lamb, Tandoori Chicken Tikka, Kebabs, etc. Entrees are in the $12-$25 range. Nothing was especially spicy, which hints to me that they are aiming at the typical Canadian palate. I had a very good time, and I really enjoyed the food.

4 stars"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the place, even before it was on Bay Street. Recently paid a visit was in the hope to try its lunch buffet, but found out it was cancelled at the moment due to some technical issues. 

We went for the 3-course lunch menu for $9.95/person. Super super decent portion for the price we paid, and the rice is always amazingly good. Staff is friendly and we got naan for free even. Definitely one of my top choices for fusion-Indian food :)"}
{"text":"I never go out of my way to write a review, but this restaurant was by far the worst experience I've had. I've been to a lot of restaurants in the GTA and this one will definitely be memorable for how bad it was. First, and foremost, there was horrible customer service. Our server had a very nonchalant attitude, to the point where he kept saying things like \"I don't know\" - this was shocking because if you are in charge of a restaurant then you should at least have some knowledge or organization skills to run a restaurant. We were a party of 15 people, and we were hardly attended to. They never came to the table to check on us or take away any dirty plates - or refill glasses. Every time, someone had to get up from the table to go ask the server something. The thing that stood out the most was that most of the table had ordered mango lassi, but when we drank it, it was bitter - as if the yoghurt had gone bad. I could tell right away because I've tried mango lassi at many other restaurants. Again, I had to get up from the table to let the server know because he didn't even come to check on us. After another server tasted it and confirmed, he took mine back, but not the rest of the table. It took him over 15 minutes to come collect the rest, so I won't be surprised if someone gets food poisoning from last night. In addition, he expected us to pay for the bad mango lassi, which completely didn't make sense - and he wasn't even apologetic. The food came very slow - we waited for over an hour. The food itself was mediocre and the only thing that made it look \"high end\" was the flowers on it lmao. The orders were all mixed up, and again, there was a huge lack of organization. There was a hair in my food, but I didn't bother complaining, as I had already brought up the lassi, and I'm not usually one to complain. At the time of the cake, they didn't even pick up the dirty plates, as most other restaurants do for birthday parties. Again, we had to get up and ask for the plates and cutlery to serve the cake, and the server was like \"we are out of plates because the restaurant is full, but I'll look\". Excuse you? There were only like two other tables full and the restaurant wasn't even full. He was being nonchalant AGAIN and lazy. He didn't even move from the computer to \"look\" at which point THE BIRTHDAY GIRL had to leave her cake to go ask him again! This was ridiculous. Honestly. How can you have a restaurant and run out of plates? There weren't even that many people there. The server was horrible at his job and incredibly lazy. I don't mean to sound mean, but I've never faced this kind of service before. I will definitely never go back, and I'm sure no one from the party won't as well. I don't recommend this place, so don't waste your time checking it out!"}
{"text":"OK, the food tasted good.

Aside from that, I have to say, I was pretty disappointed.

Overpriced, small portions.  It was more like a tapas bar with the portions they served.  But at an average price of $25 per plate, you really couldn't be more disappointed.   Yes, I already said that but we were.  My date had the seafood dish, with shrimp, calamari and fish.  There were 3 pieces of shrimp in the dish and they were those small cheap ones, not even jumbo shrimp.  Un effen real for $25!!

Both the red meat dishes, venison and something else, beef, I think, were not available, so I went with, what was it...well it was so uneventful that I can't even remember.  What ever it was it was small and unsatisfying.  

The waiter threw in a free dessert because we were so pissed, but even that sucked!  Mango cheesecake, not good.

Mediocre decor.  Good music though.

You can't even open the menu on the website, which I just tried to do so I could tell you about what I ate, but I couldn't even open it.  Hello!!  Simplify!!

We were both hungry when we left.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend after grabbing a group deal on this place. We ordered the calamari appetizer to share, which was tasty, nothing too exciting but exactly what I expect when ordering fried calamari. I got the salmon with bangali curry sauce which came with a pyramid of basmati rice. The salmon was perfect, a good portion, and the sauce was creamy and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the seafood combination, of which the best thing was the Chilean sea bass. It was easily the best thing between our two entrees. As for dessert, I ordered the mango cheesecake and he ordered the chocolate peanut cake. Both were delish, the mango cheesecake being my favourite. Service was fine. The only dislike I have with this place is the portions, while nicely presented, are a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious. I got the grilled pineapple and red beet salad. It was amazing! Perfect summer salad, a little bit sweet and refreshingly cool. Then I got the goat curry, which was quite good. I really liked the naan bread that they give you with the entree, it was nice and fluffy. For dessert I had the lychee mouse, which was good but a bit too sweet for my taste. 

The staff was nice and not over-bearing. Only thing is that the bathroom there is kind of ghetto. But it's a great restaurant that I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I got a Dealfind coupon for 5th Element for Christmas and finally went on a Friday night just before it expired.

At 7:30 on a Friday there were only 2 other tables of patrons. I hope they do some decent delivery or they won't do nearly enough business to stick around in the competitive Queen St neighbourhood. The upside: service was very fast.

We started with the mixed appetizer platter and shrimp pakora. Half of the appetizer platter was alright (the beef) but the shrimp pakora were a miss. Just boring battered and fried shrimp.

For our mains we had butter chicken and a lobster curry. Both were decent. The presentation is a little more \"high end\" than most Indian restaurants if that's what your into, personally it doesn't do much for me.

For dessert we had mango cheesecake. It was okay (it's hard to screw up dessert in my books), but tasted like they had just pulled it out of the freezer. Definitely not freshly made.

It wasn't a bad meal, but I probably won't be back anytime soon - there are just too many Indian food options that are equally as good or better.

Oh, and the washrooms are disgusting. Avoid them if you can."}
{"text":"Went there tonight as part 2 of our Indian culinary adventure (the first one was The Host, we went there the night before). All I could say is, 5th Element is way more satisfying and better quality than the Host. We used groupon voucher which gave us even better deal, $39 for 3 course meal for two. Since we came with our daughter, we added another entree. In total, we tried: Bake crab cake & lamb kebab for appetizers. Lobster and prawn, mushroom biryani, sirloin steak for entree. Then we chose pistachio ice cream for dessert. Everything we ordered was well-cooked. The curry sauce was creamy but not too heavy. Steak was melt in your mouth and my lobster prawn was tasty. All entrees came with rice. Naan was airy, not greasy, best of all, they're free (The Host will charge you $3/naan, ridiculous!). Our server was courteous, so different than the service at the Host. Big plus, the manager was able to honour our Groupon voucher although it was expired. Now that's what we call top customer service! We happily recommend this restaurant to anyone want to try good value & tasty Indian food!"}
{"text":"I came here after a winterlicious festival. They had a 3 course meal special then. 

By far, the best part of that meal was the lamb shank I ordered (it was one of several options as the main). Very well cooked. It was juicy and had a lot of flavor. 

The starter and the dessert were fine too (though the dessert looked like it was bought from a supermarket), but the reason to come back here is definitely for the lamb shank."}
{"text":"The crowd: mid to late 20serators doing their best to seem fancy under the guise of a restaurant that is also trying to be fancy. All decked out in Friday's best threads - is my loose tank too casual? Sorreh!

The ambiance: The main room is kind of weird - makes me think of a wedding reception hall. Looks like it converts into a dance floor once the clock chimes 11. We had a private room in the back for a birthday party, which was actually pretty nice. HOWEVER, the fruit fly situation is not to be avoided in this review - there were at least 10 of them buzzing about, and thankfully they eventually settled on the lip of our empty wine decanter (to get drunk, presumably). Still, gross.

The drinks: I sampled two different cocktails on the menu and give them both an enthusiastic, tipsy thumbs up. Would order again.

The food: I ordered from the summerlicious menu, which was pretty varied (vegetarian options available). I chose tuna tartar (ehn - it was okay), methi encrusted tandoori chicken (was given butter chicken instead - shouldn't I be informed of a menu change?)  and a peanut butter chocolate explosion desert that was an explosion of goop and too sweet for even ME to eat (this says a lot). Overall, not impressed.

And so, children, I give this Bay Street \"hot\" spot a 2.5 - if I'm gonna have Indian, I'll go to Babur and if I'm gonna have Italian, I'll go to Terroni, but if I'm gonna have Indian-Italian fusion? I guess the answer is I don't really want that in the first place."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6. We made a reservation. And still we waited 1.5 hours for our food. When it arrived it was good enough but the service was beyond terrible. And not just for us- everyone in the restaurant was in shock. People walked out and we are all not sure why we didn't."}
{"text":"I went to 5th Elementt with several friends for Summerlicious (lunch menu - $15) and was really impressed with the food and service overall. I also tried several other dishes that my friends ordered. The food here is good for those that enjoy spicier foods, however, you can always ask for a milder version. 

The dishes were generally well presented and the portions was just right (if there was more, I would've felt bloated because the food was delicious). Unfortunately, the naan was very burnt. 

Service: 
The waitress was attentive and friendly but not overbearing. She listened to the individual needs of each order (requests for milder level of spiciness) and was accommodating. We didn't have to wait too long for service or food and the food arrived all at once. 

Food: 

Appetizers
- I selected  the Fennel Spiced Ricotta Chicken Kabab. Unfortunately, this was my least favorite of three dishes. The taste of the food worked wonderfully with the sauce, however, the chicken was a bit dry and the presentation seemed a bit lonely with three small pieces of chicken.
- The Maryland Baked Crab Cake was delicious and delightfully presented in a crab shell. It is on the spicier side (love). The sauce that came with it was mouthwatering. Of the three appetizers that I tried, this one was a favourite.
- The Samosa and Papri Chaat was fun and spicy. It was the most textured out of the three appetizers with a smooth sauce with chopped tomatoes combined with the crunch of the puffed rice and soft interior of the samosa.  The dish was  great but the presentation, although fun, looked a bit on the messier side compared to the other appetizers. 

Entree:
- I chose the Slow Cooked Nizami Goat. It was honestly the best curry I've ever had. The meat was soft, sauce was flavourful, and the level of spiciness was just perfect for me. It was however, the spiciest out of all four entrees that I tried. The rice seemed a bit dried out but tasted fine after you ate it with the curry. 
- The Shrimp Moilee with coconut curry sauce (mild version) was good. It had a nice kick to it but nothing that really stood out for me. 
- The Madras Beef Curry was also good. Unfortunately, by this point I was overwhelmed by the flavours of the Nizami Goat and had little interest in anything else. 
- The Butter Chicken was also well done. It is a bit spicier than I expected and my friends all commented on the interesting flavour as it was the most distinctive out of the 4 dishes that we tried. 

Dessert
- I chose the Pistachio Kulfi and it was an absolute dream. It was like frozen ice cream but full of the nutty pistachio flavour. Combined with the light raspberry (?) drizzle, it was just sweet enough to be a dessert without overpowering the pistachios.
- The Lychee Cardamom Mousse was alright. The taste was there but it was a bit too warm for the occasion (hot day). 

Overall my experience was good. We were also given a $15 voucher (min. amount to spend $35)to use for their regular menu."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite go-to places in the city. Unfortunately the last couple of times I visited I was extremely disappointed. Great selection of wine, and the lamb is still delicious. I couldn't tell if the place is under new ownership but something is way off. 

Last two occasions I brought family here from out of town and the fish was awful and the appetizers were not great either. Needless to say, I was out buying burgers for the crew later that evening with my apologies for an unsuccessful dining experience.

Unfortunately, I won't be visiting anymore."}
{"text":"Ever since my friends and I discovered the Queen West location, we have been frequenting it because it is convenient and the value is incredible. (This location offers mainly Indian cuisine.) Their lunch special is definitely worth it. I am a vegetarian, but my friends can't get enough of the butter chicken. I try different veggie dishes, and they are all yummy. (If I feel like spoiling myself and having something rich, the paneer makani is very delish.) Their pistacio kulfi is a great way to end the meal. Oh, and their naan is amazing!

As always, great service with a smile completes the experience."}
{"text":"I went there for winterlicious. Our booking was at 630 and srarters were not served till 830. The service was horrible. The waitress tried to calm things down but there is only so much one person can do.
They should not be in the winterlicious list.
Food was very mediocre."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of Indian food but fell in love after trying 5th elementt.

They have an extensive menu here ranging from traditional gourmet Indian food to modern fusion Indian dishes.  With so many choices, it could get tricky to choose, so ask your server for a recommendation.  They've always been really helpful and informative every time I'm there.  If you're feeling too shy to ask, try any of their Signature dishes, which are proven to be customer favourites.

LOVE their naan but wish they didn't charge extra for those... most authentic places give naan for free.  their various appetizers are delicious, especially the Samosa & Papri Chaat and prawn pakora.

I went with 2 friends so we all shared the main entrees together.  They were all very delicious.  I love their butter chicken here, chicken biryani was tasty and the Aloo Baingan was vegetarian friendly.

The best part of our meal was the dessert - the orange mango cheesecake!  BEST I\"VE EVER HAD! 

definitely a place to try in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The food is pretty consistent and I love their mojitos! I have ordered many of the dishes and I can't say I have a favourite one, but so far everything has been quite good. I like that the menu changes every month or so and they offer a good 3-course lunch & dinner special!"}
{"text":"The biggest scam I've bought on Groupon. For a few reasons:
1. The photos on the website are not photos of their own.
2. Service was very poor. I insisted not buying drinks, but the waiter kept pushing me for virgins.
3. Portions are tiny. Plates were unnecessarily big.
4. Wobbly seat backs, dirty utensils and plates, napkins with loose threads.
5. Music was the type you could find in a club.
6. Service was extremely slow. It took 45 minutes to have two main courses ready.
7. Price was unreasonably expensive. $12 for 4 pieces of reheated meat; $24 for a lobster tail with rice.

Very unauthentic, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious, food was pretty good.  Kind of surprised given the reviews here, which are all over the map.  Maybe they have rotating chefs?

Agree with criticisms of the organization - restaurant was being heated with space heaters, presumably the heat wasn't working properly.  I liked our server, but they were pretty disorganized overall (took a while to get seated, some confusion about ordering, etc).  And this was will the place virtually empty on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Too bad Yelp! doesn't let you give a 0-star.

Decor:
Or lack of.  Trying to match the King St W hipster notion and failed big time.

Cleanliness:
Oh where do I start?  How about the floor.  There were mouse trap and sticky pad visible on the floor and around the benches...I wonder why???  Here is an idea, pay an exterminator.  Our water glasses had stuck-on food ON THE INSIDE, when I asked for a new one, the waiter/owner didn't seem to care or apologetic.  My steak and rice came with a long curly hair which I was not about to digest after seeing the rest of the restaurant.  How they pass the health inspection is beyond me.

Taste:
Fine dining my a$$, tastes more like straight out of the microwave.  There is no creativity that sets aside the food from other places.  And the fusion part, I was looking around to find that.  I ordered the steak, medium rare.  First of all, it looked more like 2 beef patties out of your local Loblaws slapped together.  Second of all, 2 pieces were rare and 1 piece was well done.  Maybe that was their attempt at FUSION??

Service:
It literately took 10 min to just get the menu and another 15 to get water or even attention at the table.  We bought a Groupon and the server didn't even seem to know what menu we are suppose to pick from.  The Groupon clearly said ANY wine upto $9/glass but the server INSISTED that it was only the $6 house-wine.  I was in no mood to argue over stupid stuff and only to get a glass of cheap Jackson & Triggs.  WOW!!!

Atmosphere:
Dark, smells like Indian food and BO mixed for too long and dirty.

Respect to those that like the crap they serve here, I don't know how you people stand it but it seems the standards in the area is fairly LOW.  Save your money and go to any over-priced franchise and it'll taste better than this slop."}
{"text":"I always ensure that I pick out the most unique outfit when visiting a new restaurant, especially one that claims to have the city's best patio. But somehow every time I decide to visit 5th element, the weather keeps me from enjoying their niche. 

I rounded up three of my most posh girlfriends, and sat them down in the restaurant. The entire interior is white, but somehow they've kept it interesting. And although I was the best dressed individual in the establishment, it bothered me that I wasn't the most fabulous.
I've never been able to gather enough guests to book their VIP table, the people that did seemed to be having a much better time than me. Sectioned off to the corner (but not inconspicuous), separated by a thin layer of red satin..damn, it was sexy.
5th Elementt is located at a highly questionable spot on Bay, parking around the area is frustrating. Selling a patio on Bay street was a risk, considering there is absolutely nothing to see. But somehow the curtains created the illusion that you were somewhere else, and this is good. From what I can tell at least, I've never dined outside. But I just know.
The service was on par, the food was exactly as advertised, this was a real fusion restaurant. At one point a black gentleman--perhaps a busboy, or perhaps the manager approached my table, topped off on our wine glasses, and complimented me on my outfit. He said I reminded him of James Bond, whether he meant it or not was irrelevant, the Man was trying to make me look good in front of the ladies. It worked, so my generous tip afterward felt justified. He wasn't too shabby himself.
I felt comfortable here, as I can tell that everyone else felt the same way.
This is a good place for a date, but I wouldn't recommend coming too late, not that it stays open into the night. The place was just little bit small, but I guess that justifies the patio. 
Damn it, I'm going to order a bottle of wine there when summer rolls around, and this time I'll check the weather channel before booking."}
{"text":"Ordered it from JustEat recently and I was pleasantly surprised.  Seems like they heard the complaints regarding the smaller portion sizes from what they had and upped the ante again.

Good on you!  I will give you 5 stars once you've proven your consistency.  I've only gotten food from you twice in the last few years because I was disappointed by how many pieces of paneer I got in my curry."}

The service was pretty standard but the food was great.... Had a mango and feta salad  and a paneer main, both we're excellent."}

rack of lamb-1 itty bitty individual part of the rack
mango and clementine salad- good
butter chicken- amazing!!!
deserts pistachio kulfi- ok
chocolate souffle - ok

repeat? probably not"}
{"text":"Very dry old chicken, probably stocked away in deep freeze for a really long time, my feedback was not taken on board at all. Some of the dishes may be a health hazard. I certainly had a tummy upset shortly after. Suggest being careful especially if you are ordering for home delivery."}
{"text":"I live in the building and have never wanted to try this restaurant. But last week my SO insisted we do a summerlicious lunch there. We wanted to go for Bruno after and I asked the host how long lunch would take and he reassured me lunch would be an hour at the max. It took us two hours to get out of there and it wasn't a happy two hours. The wait staff is horribly slow - even a glass of water took 20 minutes. The food was very mediocre and absolutely nothing memorable. I had the scallop and bacon appetizer and the salmon entre. Both are now relegated to a blur of average food and bad service. Sad!"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant has bad food when you waited an hour for your friend (traffic), starving, and still don't want to finish the appetizer you just ordered.

The food is so bad and expensive here even with a deal coupon it's still way overpriced.

Started off with chicken pakoras - This was worst than anything I would try to make.
Braised lamb shank - This wasn't good. The flavour were not strong or unique. Overall very blend favouring and cooking. Go to any traditional Indian restaurant with reasonable pricing and large portions and the food is 10x better.

The only good thing about this restaurant was the good ambiance and seating. But is it worth it when the food is this bad?

{"text":"Ordered delivery from this restaurant and received food with no silverware or rice, as would be expected if it is not otherwise specified on the menu. 

When I called to try and solve this problem, I was greeted with defensiveness and attitude. I was passed around to three employees, and lied to by the staff who said that the menu clearly says rice is not included. I was finally told that I could reorder rice but it would take 45 minutes to arrive. 

I accepted this offer, and another 45 minutes later I had a horribly cold meal that was thoroughly unenjoyable."}
{"text":"We have been fans of this resto since its old location on Bay St. Every meal we have had here has been excellent. In addition to traditional Indian dishes, this place also does steaks, seafood and veal.   

Keep an eye out for specials as well; in the past they have even done venison.

Currently this place has a 3-course fixed-price dinner that includes beer or wine (full-sized portions on all courses) for $22.95. You can't get a much better deal than that for that downtown, especially including alcohol. 

In addition to providing an intimate dinner out, this place offers delivery and does lunch specials. 

It's an award-winning restaurant for a reason: consistency. The service is good, the food is good, every time. In addition it is affordable."}

LOCATION/BOOKING
Located just path the lights at Queen/Bathurst. Found street parking and walked over, relatively easy to spot. No reservation was needed (although I did call back after to make one).

DRESS CODE
Casual. 

ATMOSPHERE
The venue itself was very utilitarian. Some cool art on the walls, abstract pieces, paintings of Parisian scenes, etc (odd though, considering it is an Indian restaurant so doesn't quite fit the idea of an \"authentic\" Indian venue\"). That being said, 5th Elementt does advertise itself as a Indian Fusion resto but they should still have some traditional design elements. Boots up one side, chairs and tables the others. Decent size. Cool lighting. It was also slightly cold. We were the only ones aside from a 14 top. 

FOOD
I ordered:
Mango/apple salad - liked it. Fresh and slightly tangy although I would have liked more mango on it. 
Korma chicken - meh. The cashew sauce was very creamy and yummy. Chicken was just a tiny bit dry and the rice was nothing special and a little cold. 
Jumbala? (Can't remember exactly what it was called) - ordered off menu. It appeared to be a spongy ball of fried dough (like a Timbit) covered in a sugar honey glaze. Well prepared, I just didn't like it (my personal taste). 
Nann - first time trying. Slightly burnt where the dough had bubbled but once I picked that off, I liked it. 

SERVICE
Love/hate.
Our waiter, Abir (whom I suspect to be the owner's son) was extremely friendly and attentive but you could tell he was newer as he had to return a few times to ask questions - however, he did it all in a manner that obviously shows he cares about your experience so it's endearing. 

The problem? SLOOOOOOOOOOOOW.
We were there for over an hour and a half (arrived about 8:20PM for an 8:30PM reservation. By the time we got seated and drinks ordered, 8:40PM ish. Apps did't come out until just after 9PM (about forty minutes). We orderd a salad and some fried chicken and plum chutney dish - no way it should have taken that long, even with the other large table (they were all already eating when they arrived). 
My app came first, my partner's app did not arrive with mine (awkward and bad timing). I asked about the Naan so that he would at least have something to munch on and the server said it would be coming with the mains at which point I (having inferred that the food would be slow coming all night) asked that everything be fired and delivered ASAP. 
Had to ask twice for takeout containers.

PRICE/VALUE
We went with a Groupon ($39 for a four course meal for 2) but after tax and tip (I tipped the server 15% only because of a guilty conscience because he was so earnest - if he had been rude or unattentive, he would have gotten 0). After tax and tip, it ended up being a $60 meal which, considering that the food was good but not spectacular and the service HORRENDOUSLY slow made me kind of sour. 
Normal pricing is $5-$20 an item. 

OVERALL
Food was good but the service was so slow that I would not go back. They need to get some more bodies in the kitchen and on the floor to expedite service."}
{"text":"The Yorkville location was amazing. They downsized to a MUCH smaller venue on Queen West. 

The food portion sizes are huge, good presentation, VERY FLAVOURFUL. 
The new space is sort of small. I've been there and they may have a violinist and cello player on a weekend night.

If you love lamb, their lamb is amazing. This is fusion food done perfectly.
I will also mention the prices are incredibly good. I do not suggest going here with a Groupon as many people have negatively reviewed went with - I don't think going with  Groupon anywhere is going to afford you good service, just saying.

This is one of my go to restaurants, but I think I have brought everyone here already...so have to find a new place."}
{"text":"Just got an email from Vijay Karumanchi, the owner of 5th Elementt, saying that as of May 3rd 2010, the restaurant is now closed.  It's too bad.  This wasn't my favourite restaurant but this place was fairly solid."}
{"text":"Been to 5th element once before and the food was pretty good with large portion sizes. Went back during Summerlicious for lunch and it was a total disappointment. 

Portion sizes were really small (probably a summerlicious thing) and the food wasn't that great. The atomsphere was nice, only one of the staff was attentive. 

For appetizers, we got the summer salad, which had lots of mangoes drizzled with mango sauce, I really like mangoes so I enjoyed it. Lamb kabob, it was more like a lamb sausage, it was okay but not amazing. 

For main, we got the lahore (beef) curry and the lamb curry. I didn't try the lamb because it was too spicy but the lahore beef curry, the beef was SO dry. I found a HAIR in my beef curry. Needless to say, I was disgusted. I didn't finish the rest of the food, not like there was a lot of food to begin with. 

The naan that came with the curry was BURNT. 

For dessert, we got the cheesecake and the pistachio kulfi. The kulfi was a bit bland but the cheesecake was flavorful. 

Would've gave it only 1 star if it wasn't for the summer salad and the dessert. Never going back."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers for dinner after work one day. We've heard some good things from another coworker and decided to give this place a try. The place was empty at 7:30pm on a Thursday night which made us very sceptical. It was pretty warm inside the restaurant, to the point when we started to sweat a bit as we waited for the food. They eventually urged on the AC when we started eating. 

food: food was pretty good. I ordered the lamb Korma (cashew sauce) which was very creamy with a little bit of spicy. Dipped some garlic naan which was amazingly delicious. 

Service wasn't poor since we were the only customers but it isn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"calamari-its OK
lamb shank--very tender! i liked how it was fall off the bone
crepe with a fruity ice cream bar--not so good. it had a weird kind of ice cream that i couldn't really put my finger on. banana?pineapple? who knows!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon due to hesitation to fully commit to trying new cuisine. So Groupons are my way of trying a restaurant without fully committing. I read some reviews and decided to give this place a shot. I am glad we did, the food and the service was a very positive experience. Not being able to handle spicy very well the kebabs appetizer were on the fire side. The mains we ordered were butter chicken (of course) and creamy cashew lamb korma . Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with helping us choose the right dishes for us. Which meats complimented which curry/sauces. We ordered 1 rice and 1 garlic naan. The naan bread bread was very good and the garlic was a very nice touch. All of the mains were well balanced and not overly spicy. For dessert I ordered the gulab jamun (milk balls in syrup) and my bf ordered the mango cheesecake. The highlight was the gulab jamun which was so good! Also the butter chicken and the special Sweet sauce the waiter brought out for us. Really good service and the food all had a lot of flavour. I hope my review coming from a noob helped anyone who is not familiar with Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I came here to treat my family to lunch, after seeing it being top rated on many lists on menupalace.com (http://www.menupalace.com/menupalace/top10/top10.asp). 

I couldn't find it on Google Streetview, but it's there with yellow exterior walls, on the northern side of Queen St.

AS FOR PARKING: There is a parking lot ($1.75/half hr) behind The Hideout. To get there you need to go west of 5th Elementt, north on Ryerson Avenue, right on Wolseley and right again (one way street). 

The ambiance was enjoyable. Not pretentiously over-classy, but adequately so. We were sat at one of the booths and the waiter was very well-mannered and respectful. He had a very professional attitude and took our orders patiently. 

I could tell that the entrepreneurs of this restaurant were an innovative bunch as they had a small promotional sign on the table: \"Leave your business cards for a chance to win a dinner for 2! Winners announced weekly.\" They also have twitter and facebook accounts.

We ordered off the Prix-fixe lunch menu, covering the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. 

The appetizers came about 10 mins post-ordering (samosa, vegetable pakoras, and aloo papri chaat), and they were delicious. Tolerably spicy for those with sensitive tongues (like me), but considered mild for the chili-lovers. Although I liked the, my mother was iffy with the samosas, saying they were not crispy enough, but blaming it on her own taste preferences. The portions were decent and we were starting to feel our stomachs occupied.

After another 15 minutes or so since the waiter had taken our appetizer dishes away, the entrees came. The portions were deceivingly small and the sauce on my butter chicken looked generous, but I was very full by the end of it! The portions and sauce-chicken-rice ratio were actually quite accurate. The sauce was delicious and well-mastered, and the chicken was tender. The rice was yellow with tamarik and spices. It was one of the best meals I'd had. 

The desserts however were not really my cup of tea. I ordered the Gulab Jamun after googling pictures of it. They were like 2 little timbits on my plate, awkwardly spread apart on polar ends of my dish. it was coconut-y and very, very sweet. Although small, it was dense with syrup.
The rice pudding was bland by comparison, quite watery, and the carrot halwa was in between. 

The meal, all in all, was wonderful, especially for the price offered ($9.95 for 3 courses!) I would most definitely come here again if I ever crave authentic and classy indian food. It is definitely a must-try and deserves its spot on menupalace.com."}
{"text":"I got off work early one day (Around 4:30) and decided to get Indian food with my boyfriend. I walked into the restaurant and it was empty. The Thai server was lying on the couch (wearing her UGGS and her Canada Goose -  I remember so clearly). I couldn't help but start laughing and asked \"is it open yet?\", and she told me to come back in 15 minutes. 

15 minutes I came back, and she was ready to seat us. My boyfriend and I ordered the Lamb Kebab, as appetizer, Lobster and Shrimp Moilee, as the entree, and cheesecake for dessert. As the only table sitting (at 5 pm on a Friday night), we were given so much attention. \"Are you guys cold\" \"How is the food\" ...etc

The food was delicious, the server was accommodating, and I liked the overall dining experience. DRAWBACKS though... it's not very well decorated, used a portable fan inside the restaurant, server was not dressed appropriately for an Indian restaurant, and the portions were small. 


Good experience, but would not come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for their Summerlicious '13 lunch menu. First off, the staff were very helpful and friendly as we were a group of 8. This place left me with great impressions and would love to come again if the location wasn't so inconvenient for me. 

As appetizer, I tried the crab cake which was great and it got me more anticipated for the entree to see how much better it could get. I got the slow cooked Nizami Goat as main. It was delicious. Everything was so flavourful. Though I eat spicy, the spice added up as I continued my meal and had to drink some water in between spoonfuls. But it was one of those dishes where it's spicy but you can't stop cos it was so good.

For dessert, I chose the pistachio kulfi. Love it! The texture was similar to ice cream, and it was full of pistachio flavour. (Most pistachio stuff out there tastes really bland/not enough pistachios)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars **

Indian restaurant with an American twist.

On a Sunday night - 9:00pm, my gf and I were the only customers in the restaurant. Hesitant at first to go in, but we decided to give it a try.

They were offering a 2 for 1 - $29.95 3-course prix fix dinner until March 15th.

Ordered:
Appetizers: 
Rack of Lamb
Salmon wrapped scallops

I enjoyed both appetizers. The lamb was tender and the scallops were cooked to perfection.

Entrees:
Braised lamb shank
Tandoori Chicken

Both served with rice. The Tandoori chicken was my favourite, served with a creamy butter chicken sauce. Though the chicken was a bit on the dry side, the sauce made up for it. The lamb shank had a nice flavour, though the meat was on the tough side.

Dessert:
Peanut butter chocolate cake
Carrot halwa with raspberry sorbet

Probably where the rating lost some **. The chocolate cake was topped off with Orange and Black peanut butter M&Ms, which felt and tasted like something I could have purchased from a supermarket.
The carrot halwa with the raspberry sorbet felt like an odd combination. Of course, personal preference.

The service was attentive and prompt. Well, we were the only table there, so I guess you have to take other's words for it.

I would go back to try out the other dishes, probably sticking to the appetizers and entrees."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times in the past few years and had a good time.
I tried to eat here yesterday at 6:00 PM and found the restaurant to be closed. They never answered their phones, or answered e-mails and never put the right opening hours, or a sign saying that they are closed on their door.
It was very disappointing and I don't think I'll be trying to come here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ate here when it used to be on Bay Street and had an amazing meal, but I was disappointed this time around.

Shrimp Pakora: it was just 6 shrimps dipped into a wet batted with some pakora-inspired spices for $12. It was definitely not what I expected for $12 and did not reassemble a pakora in any manner. 

Fish Cakes: wasn't anything to write home about. Shredded pieces of fish spiced up to mask the fact that the fish was not fresh. 

Butter chicken: too salty and too tart for my taste. The chicken could have been a bit more moist too.

Lobster & shrimp moilee: this dish was very good. If I were to ever come back this would be the only dish I would order. It was very well done. 

Value: over priced for mediocre food. If you want to try this place get their groupon - they always have a deal on their. Otherwise its way over priced for the quality you get. 

Service: I have a problem with wait staff asking their guests to pass them their finished plates to be cleared or give them their water glasses to be refilled. The tables are well spaced so all the waiter had to do was move around (vs. Standing at either end of the table and asking us to pass them our glasses/plates) and reaching between the guests. 

I know many may say that, \"that is no big deal\", or \"so what you had to pass your plate/glass to the waiter\", but because most places I go to (and they are not fancy high end restaurants either and even at places that charge less than here) the wait staff just walks around and collects the plates and refills the water without interrupting the guests. That's why when I go somewhere where they don't, it really stands out for me."}
{"text":"This place just does not do it for me. The tacky decor and the prices make me sick. To me it feels as if its a try-hard's restaurant. Trying to be trending, cool, interesting, and delicious. Just doesn't cut it. 

The menu looks decent and a few items sound like an interesting fusion but as interesting as they sound they fail to deliver on taste. I am also unsure of what type of restaurant this is supposed to be. Is it a steakhouse, indian place, or Mexican? I like how there's variety but with a menu and approach so pretentious it would be to their advantage to stick to something and be good at it instead of being mediocre at all of it. 

Food tasted fine but I debate the freshness of the produce and capabilities of a chef that fail to cook and properly present a dish. My potatoes tasted stale and the sauce that was to accompany my lamb was cold, as if it came from a fridge. Portions were also a little on the skimpy side. 

Decor is absolutely dreadful. I've been to dive bars and crappy restaurants and I can appreciate something that looks a little less than presentable. Problem with this place is it tries to give off a high class notion and the decor seems as if they went to Ikea's ugly little sister to try and achieve it. Weird paint scheme as the colors don't match nor give dramatic effect, the 'curtains' hanging seem like red bedsheets used to cover some of the windows and also as dividers, white table cloths are nice but they are plain white so it's hard to go wrong, cutlery and dinner wear seem cheap like oddly shaped or something, the mismatch house plants, and the dreadful floor matching chairs. For a restaurant trying to be on the cutting edge it needs to get out of the '90s. I'm surprised they aren't using baby vegetables it's so '90s.

Service was good, I'll give them that. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and very nice. Noticing small cues and always on the ball for refills, requests, etc. Service was the best thing at the restaurant.

Overall, it's not worth the money at all to come here. Pretentious people that can't afford the pretentious life go to this place so it makes for a grreeeeaat scene. Food falls flat and decor is horrendous. Go elsewhere to spend your money."}
{"text":"This is going to be a short review. We had the fixed price menu, which started out \"good\", and got increasingly better as it went on, culminating 
in desert: the Pistachio Kulfi.

And let me tell *you*. That Pistachio Kulfi? Best thing I've ever put in my mouth. For reals, yo.

I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. By God, I'm not, so stop thinking it.

It looked like a green hockey puck on the plate - a *pretty* green hockey puck, mind you. It had some sauces, too, drizzled in that pretty-drizzled-sauce kind of way. Might have been tamarind. Who can tell, 'cuz after I bit into the Kulfi,  well... mind = blown.

Of course, if you don't like Pistachio, you're up poop creek sans le paddle.

But if you do... well, you get the picture."}
{"text":"Well! Color me impressed. Friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, delicious food. Great summerlicious value! Decent portion sizes. 

Tandoori shrimp - delicious, although slightly overdone. Lobster and shrimp moilee, scrumptious and definitely what brought this over the top. A pris fixe at $25 with lobster?! Amazing. Delicious, especially the curry sauce and fresh naan. I can do without the rice and seafood slightly overdone again (typical of south Asian cooking), but compensated for with fabulous curry. 

Mango cheesecake - sweet but delicious. Pistachio kulfi - yum! Everything was beautifully plated. I was very happy walking out of here :)

PS: THE BUTTER CHICKEN (sauce) IS TO DIE FOR. I've searched 12+ years for San Francisco style butter chicken and accidentally ran across it in this random place when my roommate ordered! Best part - paneer makhani uses the same sauce. Hands down, no need to try any more Indian places for this (the flavor tends to run different in Toronto) - this is obviously the best butter chicken in town. ******"}
{"text":"I love the takeout from this place. 
Really quick, too. 


The BAD: 
just don't get the veg curry. 
It's terrible. Beyond terrible.  Frozen green beans. hard as a rock carrots. 
in a flavorless 'curry'??? sauce.
BAD BAD BADDDD!!! It was a one time error ordering this. Just don't make my mistake! 

The GOOD: 
The other dishes I had were awesome. And it's the most reasonably priced Indian in the area. It will definitely be my go-to from here on in (minus the disgusting veg curry dish!)

My favs:
- Vegetable Samosa
- Garlic Naan (much better than the plain one ..), although very overpriced at $3.95 each! 
-Butter chicken
- Aloo Gobhi (veg dish)
- Saag Paneer (veg dish)

{"text":"My friend and I jumped into this restaurant by chance on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. It turned out they were taking part in Summerlicious so we only saw the set menu. There was only one nervous-looking young man serving everyone (just a couple of tables) but he seemed to manage ok. The chopped up samosa appetizer was good, the butter chicken was delicious the mutton was good too, I just had trouble eating it because it was so hot (even with a side of a yogurt sauce that I requested and then some sugar - apparently some Indian people eat their spicy dishes with sugar - who knew!) but the naan was warm and the mango cheesecake seemed quite fresh. The chair I was in was really rickety so I switched it with another one and that solved that problem. The place is smallish but modern and has good sized tables that are spaced out nicely. The floor was kinda covered in food bits, I don't know if they were short staffed that day or if there was a really messy bunch of people sitting there, but the rest of the restaurant, including the washrooms, was clean so I'd be confident eating there again."}
{"text":"We had lunch at 5th Elementt today.

Here's what we liked:
- the Butter Chicken was good
- The salmon with curry sauce was good
- Fresh naan bread
- Shrimp pakora

What we didn't like:
- We were looking at the standard menu but had a Dealicious Voucherfor $50.  Once the waiter saw that -- he told us we could not order from the main menu, and presented another menu.  Many of those items were on the main menu, but at different prices.  Some considerably higher.  We thought this was a big of a \"come-on\" and were not pleased by this
- they had prix-fix for lunch - 3 courses for $15.
- our bill was $54 before taxes (only thing extra was a beverage for $6). Needless to say we didn't think much of that.  We had to pay $27 on top of the voucher as it did not cover the entire lunch and we had to cover tax and tip -- so $77 for lunch -- VERY expensive for a place like this!
- service was quite a slow (1-1/2 hours for lunch -- but maybe that was due to the special menu)

Not sure we will be back -- but my take is do NOT buy any Dealicious vouchers for them -- so not worth it."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.

Came for Winterlicious with a friend, and while the food was good we definitely experienced some issues.

Our server was pretty much non-existant. He came to take our inital order and came back only once throughout the entire meal to check in on us. We waited an extremely long time just for water - he didn't even ask if we wanted other drinks. There were very few times when our water was refilled.

The amuse was not the amuse listed on the menu & we were not told that until after we got it. It was a very plain, indian inspired soup.

For the app I had the Chicken Pakora, which definitely had the potential to be delicious, but it was a bit soggy and not crispy enough, so certainly a dissappointment on that front. Though even with the lack of crispiness, it was still decent.

For the entre I had Madras Chicken Curry - no complaints there! It was certianly yummy. Chicken & rice were cooked well, and the curry had a nice flavour to it. Wasn't the best I've ever had, nor was it a stand-out, but it was still good.

Between the time we finished our entrees, to the time we were served our dessert, more than 30 minutes had passed. I think they may have forgot about us because someone (who advised they did not actually work at the restaurant, but was a client who was slowly buying into the restaurant, helping out because it was busy) asked us what desserts we actually ordered.

Once my dessert did arrive, again, it was not the item listed on the menu. The menu listed \"mango orange cheesecake with a kiwi lime drizzle\", however, what I received was 5 pieces of different types of cheesecake (strawberry, mango, and blueberry) with a raspberry drizzle. Even though it wasn't what was on the menu, they were pretty good.

I feel like I would have rated this place higher, but something just really bugs me about them serving you food that is not what you think you are getting, without telling you until afterwards (also could be quite disastrous if you had a food allergy). Also, big points lost for the extremely poor service.

Probably won't make my way back here, even though the food was good."}
{"text":"Great for any of the winterlicious menu in terms of value and offering. Every item was AMAZING.
Service was a little short for a packed resto.
I dont know about the ala carte but I am thinking its a good sign...

Cocktails were horrible (watered down). Stick with wine and beer"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with coworkers.  It was during Christmas so it was pretty empty.  

Locale: clean, very well lit.  The view from inside the restaurant surprised me, you could see a lot of building in the distance, and the skyline.

Service: The staff was friendly.

Food: I ordered the lunch special, (15$ with tax and tip).  The waiter brought a few Nan's and told us in advance to request more if necessary.  Which we did once, and he kept an eye and refilled our baskets multiple times without us requsting more. The food tasted good.  Even the tofu which I usually can't stand was tasty. 


 The food was tasty, service friend.  would go again."}
{"text":"5th Elementt has a terrible sign.

Their sign screams \"Hole in the was shwarma counter place\".  Not the sort of place you would go for a nice dinner.  However, contrary to what their sign outside would have you think, this is a really lovely Indian restaurant with modern takes on Indian cuisine (not your standard curry house.)

We've been here twice now, once with a daily-deal coupon (where we received excellent service despite the coupon - not something you always get) and once where we tried their regular prix-fixe menu (also an excellent value.)  The decor and ambiance are really nice, the service attentive without being annoying, and the food is tasty.  A great date-night restaurant.  

But they should really do something about that sign."}
{"text":"The menu items are all 4's or 1's.  It is very hit or miss.  The Indian menu items are good.  I had a chickpea salad that was really flavorful, and the butter chicken and vindaloo sauce (on the steak) are both decent too.  However, some of the fusion menu items are downright terrifying...mozarella samosas?  They are as bad as they sound.  Also, they put this really sugary, completely superfluous raspberry drizzle on the desserts, which basically ruins any flavor they may have."}
{"text":"The menu here is focused on people getting their own individual dishes as opposed to sharing several dishes. Nice idea in concept but sadly the quality of the dishes does not justify the cost. The food is ok, but not great by any means and in my opinion way over priced. Also the time to get our meal was extremely long considering how empty the place was. I love love love Indian food and I can certainly  get better for less else where."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was blown away by the polished flavors of the lamb and shrimp dishes. The quality was a little uneven on my second visit. Overall, the place definitely warrants 4 stars for the food that I tasted.

It's a narrow place as is the style of many a resto on that stretch of Queen W. Nothing fancy to look at. However, the bathrooms reek. The physical space should be spruced up.

Among the appetizers, the shrimp pakodas and the lamb kebabs were reliably delicious. The chicken offerings, while well spiced, were unfortunately not as lip smacking. So stay away from those.

The shrimp pakodas aka fritters were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and paired superbly with a delicious mango salsa. The lamb kebabs were very flavorful and tender, though the green mint chutney is quite lifeless.

The leg of lamb was fall of the bone tender, and melt in your mouth delicious. Though parts of the meat were a bit sinewy and the second time around the dish was a bit too salty for my taste.

The shrimp and lobster moilee had a delicious coconut and mustard sauce which was really, really, really good. They should remove the lobster from this dish because rubberized lobster is no value added.  Just shrimp should suffice. 

Both the lamb and the shrimp dishes were paired with a rice pilaf which complemented the meats well.

We ordered naan on both occasions and it came piping hot and soft from the oven!

The desserts were fantastic. The first time we had mango phirnee which was divine: soft, sweet but subtly so, and a strong mango flavoring. Turns out they make it with pureed rice. Very smart. 

The mango cheesecake we had second time around was dense, delicious and decadent.

The service the first time around was exceptional: very friendly and attentive. The second time around it was very efficient but not as warm. Different servers.

For a place that regularly offers Groupon deals, 5th Elementt is much better than the rest of its brethren in the Groupon category. If only it took more pride in its physical appearance. Slight tweaks to their chicken dishes, and they're golden.

This place could become my go-to for Indian in the city."}
{"text":"Here are the first 5 reasons why I deem this restaurant to be the winner for best service:

1) Attentive but not overbearing staff. The waiter was always nearby, but allowed us to eat our meal in peace.

2) Accommodating. If not happy with a dish, to be offered other options.  I did not like a dessert and the waiter offered me other desserts.

3) Staff goes out of their way. I love bhatura; a fried Indian bread. I asked the waiter if it was on their regular menu, and he said no. When I received my main the waiter brought out a large bhatura. The chef made it specially for me. Awesome!

4) Patient. I had a lot of questions about the dishes, and the waiter was always eager to answer them or inquire with the chef if he did not have an answer.

5) On the ball. I could not finish a main, and the waiter came back with a take out container before I even asked for one.

The food:

1) Good portions. Not too much food, but not stingy either.

2) Every dish was beautifully plated.

3) We all either finished our dishes or took them home to eat later. No one left food behind. That is always a good sign.

4) The flavors were well-balanced. If you wanted it less spicy or more spicy, the request was accommodated.

5) We all felt comfortable sharing the food and passing it around. It felt like eating at home with family during the holidays."}
{"text":"Good service and good food.

Had samosas, butter chicken and their ice cream. Everything tasted delicious. Was hoping for the food to be more spicy but it was good enough.  Everything came out very quickly. 

I think the heater was broken at the time of my visit, so there were portable heaters everywhere."}
{"text":"Came here for valentines dinner and took advantage of the fixed price menu! For 35 dollars I had a mimosa, aloo gobi chowder( excuse my picture caption was misinformed by the waiter), Butter garlic shrimp appetizer, baked lobster with sautéed shrimp and orange mango cheesecake. Everything tasted delicious! I has absolutely no complaints. The meal was flavourful but not overbearing for a newbie to try. To be honest some of the flavours reminded me of Thai food because of the use of coconut cream in the currys. The ambiance was perfect for valentines day with dim lighting and candles everywhere. The service is top notch! They continuously check up on you and refill your table with water and nan. I would definitely come back. I would give this place 5 stars if the portions were slightly bigger ( I wouldn't mind paying more for this delicious food) and the washrooms were cleaner."}
{"text":"Great if you have a voucher from one of the daily deal websites, but pricy otherwise. The plates are disproportionately huge...why? My personal recommendation would be Trimurti (265 Queen St West)."}
{"text":"We got Saag Paneer and Lobster Tail on Rice with coconut sauce. Food was surprisingly good, although the portions are very small. 

The waitress was attentive and very friendly. 

Despite all the positives mentioned above, I most likely will not return. It is over-priced for what you get,  even with Groupon it was not worth the value."}
{"text":"I was excited to come back here for dinner, but my excitement turned to a huge disappointment. The restaurant is under new management and they have a different cook and a lot has changed for the worst.

There is a rather random butter sculpture of Venus in the window done by one of their chefs. It's funny to see people stop on the sidewalk and look at this sculpture.
Gone are all of the irrelevant photos and paintings of Paris and it now has Indian artwork.
The place was very cold and a space heater sits in the middle of the floor. An odd mix of 90's alternative and pop music with the occasional Indian music plays from a cheap set of speakers which sounds awful to point of being irritating.

The server was very friendly and courteous. I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc which I was mistakenly served a Cabernet Sauvignon. The waiter apologized and was caught off guard as it took him a little while to figure out the mistake -- it was fine but I thought mixing up a white with a red wine is unheard of. The wine selection is limited and rather lame -- Woodbridge and Yellowtail to name a few. 

The menu has changed a little, however the cooking is very different.
We first started with an appetizer the waiter recommended which was a the Chicken kabab which was served on a sizzling platter. It was not particularly interesting, it was just an okay chicken tandoori and could have used more veggies or something to serve it with.
There wasn't a good choice of appetizers it was either salads or just meat and nothing in between. I miss the complementary pappadam which they now charge extra.

I ordered the lamb vindaloo which tasted much different and served differently too. With the previous staff the dishes was nicely presented and had a more modern take with great flavours, but all of that was gone. The curries were served in a smallish stainless steel bowl and was very mediocre. I miss the cool looking ceramic bowls that look like plates. My lamb was a bit on the tough side. The quality is no different than what you find in a typical Indian buffet restaurant. For $14 seems steep for a small portion of mediocre curry with no side of naan or rice, that is extra, and missing from their menu was their tasty cheese naan.

I had a gift card which the new management no longer honoured which was one of the reasons why I returned, so I was disappointed. The waiter greatly apologized and offered us a Gulab dessert on the house instead. The gift card was only $15 so it was no big loss.

So to sum it up this was not the same 5th Elementt restaurant I used to love and there was nothing special about this place which will make me want to return."}
{"text":"Pricy considering how small the portions are. The food is also awful. I'm not sure if its the poor quality of meat, the bland sauces they use or both. Salmon was barely passable. Lamb was absolutely horrid- bland and just... horrible. Saag paneer was bland and horrible too. The tandoori chicken was the only dish that was good because of the sauce (with tough but passable chicken) but it's not enough to save the entire restaurant."}
