{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent white sangria. Bruschetta was a bit skimpy but flavorful. The Med Plate was enormous with some of the best hummus I've ever had. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time with girlfriends here last night. Waiter Keith was phenomenal. Very knowledgeable and friendly. I cannot say enough about the quality of the wine and the food. The details all the way down to the glasses and dishware were head and shoulders above other wine bars I've been to. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place for drinks for happy hour!  The Bruschetta Planks are amazing and the wine selection is excellent.   I especially like the outside seating."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I went here a month ago with a large group of friends. I do recommend making reservations cause the place was packed. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, even the bathroom was gorgeous!  We had the med plate. Prior to it I didn't like humus but their's was amazing and served with fresh, warm, soft pita bread. I definitely ate my share. The mozzarella Brushetta was very good, the basalmic was sweet and the perfect topping. Pizza was delicious and tasted freshly made. Atmosphire was relaxing, the guy singing had a beautiful voice that kinda reminded me of John Meyer. But be warned, watch out for the lemoncello... it is STRONG. I had to water it down."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, loved the love music on Friday night.   Good service.   Cheese board was yummy.  Cute place on High Street.   Make a reservation if going with large party.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place! The calzone is out of this world, also really like the calamari. Been here over 10 times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Trendy decor yet causal. This would be a great place to meet up with friends.  Good service as well.  Wine list decent by glass.  I had the pizza, little burned on the bottom but I didn't figure out what I was tasting till the 2nd piece. Still edible so I powered through it."}
{"text":"I love the one on Mill and I am so glad there is one closer to home. The red sangria and the food are just as good!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Love the med plate and the sandwiches. The patio is nice during the cooler months. Great place for lunch! I'm excitedly waiting for them to open another location in Chandler."}
{"text":"Bartender was quite knowledgable and helped me get a terrific wine. Nice ambiance.  Nice relaxing place to chill and have a nice conversation."}
{"text":"We had a larger party (7) and they were able to get us in without an issue.  Service was great and they were able to accommodate our convoluted check splitting.  The food was solid but the wine list was lacking compared to what I would have expected from a \"wine bar\".   Overall a great evening.  I will definitely be back if I get the chance.  Mixed drinks: 5/5 Wine list: 3/5 (for a wine bar, 4/5 compared to other restaurants) Apps: 4/5 Main dishes: 4/5  I'd highly recommend they think about adding wine flights to their menu.  It is a pretty standard practice for wine bars so I was surprised not to see any."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. All four of us had different plates and all were very pleased. 2 salads, a sandwich,  and a pizza. All fresh and seasoned well. We were seated outside.  Not a bad call on a pleasant day. Server attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other night, I created my own pizza that wasn't on the menu and put pesto sauce , kalamata olives, mozzarella and pepperoni. It came out perfect and on point! My daughter also got a build your own pasta and it came out amazing as well. The waiter was nice and prompt. Kept our drinks filled without having to ask, took dishes away as we finished. If we didn't live so far away , it would be a regular place."}
{"text":"Went here on a double date, it was a nice atmosphere. Loud music, nice booth we sat in. Ordered pizza and hummus for appetizer it was pretty good. Cool place, good food and wine. Their bread was amazing ;)"}
{"text":"I wish the service was not horrible because the food is good. We have been there multiple times with unfortunately extremely poor service from their wait staff. They have finally  struck out with us and we will no longer return."}
{"text":"Honestly very nice people but food was not good.  We ordered Caprese and muscles and both were extremely average.  They do have great happy hour wine deals and good selection."}
{"text":"This place is uncomfortable just to be there! Not a friendly place and you dont feel welcome!  Went there and felt we were rushed to get the order,.but the main issue was that it was not crowded, which should have been a red flag,.but we ordered a salad in addition to our meal and never got it!! Will never ever go there again!!"}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere and happy hour prices are amazing. We just spent 5 hours here catching up with friends. There was four of us and our bill was $300. We got antipasti plate, charcuterie plate and the 4 for $12 bruschetta boards. We also had a bottle of malbec and each person probably had 6-7 single glasses of wine. Oh yea, and creme brulee & cookie crumble dessert!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner this weekend. Ordered a couple glasses of California Cab and split a Margherita pizza. It's a great location with lots of attractive people watching. Busy. The food was good and the service was average. Overall I'd recommend it.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time at La Bocca and we really enjoyed it. We had a reservation for the 6 of us and they had our table ready for us when we arrived. It was inside and because it was so noisy inside the restaurant we asked to be seated at a table outside on the patio. They were able to accommodate us and we proceeded to enjoy a variety of dishes from their menu. All were very good. We would definitely go back again.."}
{"text":"What a great little italian bistro.  I love the pizza's and my wife really likes the lasagna.  It has some really nice wines by the glass and a full bar.  The mood is light and festive with old italian movies projected on one of the walls.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun place with good food."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at La Bocca tonight! Positive thoughts from making a reservation yesterday to our wonderful server Todd tonight and then to top it off a short lesson on different style wine glasses at our table from Mark the wine sommeielier.  All of us have been wine tasting several times but learned something new tonight.  The food was good the table shared the garlic pizza, brussel sprout pizza and also the beet salad and chop salad.  We were there for happy hour so also got a good price on wines and cocktails. I personally was more a fan of the pizzas than salads but 2 in the group really liked the beet salad."}
{"text":"Amazing set up! Made a reservation for a Thursday girls night and it was BUSY - but we had an awesome server - their sangria was wonderful as well as their varietal wine and cocktail list.   Order mussels and truffle fries as starters and both exceeded expectations. Mussels were awesomely fresh! Highly recommended if you like seafood.   Bocca Trio pizza was also very enjoyable - the pizza dough tasted fresh and couldn't be any better!   Makes sense they are busy - I would definitely make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better place to have great wine, delicious food and friendly service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible and unwelcoming. The server Thomas literally said \"are you having a good night? Because if not you can leave\". After asking for the manager and him having the same mindset we left and will never return. Horrible! No exaggeration."}
{"text":"This is our go to dinner place. Their food is delicious and their atmosphere is amazing. They have good happy hour prices on drinks - perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"Awesome venue! Thank you to the staff for being able to host my boyfriends surprise party! Food was delicious and drinks were perfect. Everyone had a great time. Plus everyone loved the restaurant. Great Place! - Melina Shah"}
{"text":"This is my second time to this location. Sat at the bar, bar keep was super friendly and quick to shake my hand. The cheese platter was great, my beer nice and crisp, but second time in a row my calzone sucked. A little to black on the outside yet somehow cold in the middle.... I like the staff and will go back because of the very nice staff. Please guys, fix this!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good appetizers and didn't feel rushed to leave after my date and I were done with our food and drinks."}
{"text":"It's great to see High Street (formerly City North) revitalize with this great restaurant.  The bruschetta is some of the best I have ever eaten.  The pizza is delicious and fresh.  The atmosphere is comfortable and the vibe is lively.  The staff is very knowledgeable with their menu and wine recommendations.   Lovely patio seating.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  Wonderful friendly staff...always making sure we were doing ok!  Thanks! Yummy food!!"}
{"text":"I received the worst service of my life here. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The waiter completely ignored us the whole time. Didn't even ask if we wanted a second drink, didn't refill our water. Disappeared for at least 30 mins and we had to ask another server for the check. The food is good, but not good enough for such awful service. No one once apologized. We would have ordered more had we been asked. Business lost."}
{"text":"Just a great experience all around.  Good food,  wine .... atmosphere and music pleasant ...not too loud or soft.  Very knowledgeable wait staff  ... about the wine and food. .. very attentive and friendly.   Layout of the tables vary  from dining to tall tables to sofas with outdoor fireplaces.  A classic black and white film always is projected on the back wall giving the place a very unique ambience.   Prices are reasonable with a good happy hour menu that is every day including Sunday."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great! Food is not. Had the pasta w meatballs which consisted of a bowl of gummy flavorless pasta w 2 small meatballs for $15.00. I left hungry and went home and ate a PB&J sandwich. With that being said, you are paying for atmosphere not good food."}
{"text":"We live in Desert Ridge so La Bocca is really convenient for us but I'd still make the drive to get here otherwise. Their sandwiches are great, salads are wonderful, pizzas and calzones are amazing! The only thing I've ever been less than pleased with was the calamari, which was comparable to most places I've eaten calamari at. It wasn't bad, just not stellar like everything else I've tried here."}
{"text":"I've dined at La Bocca's Tempe location several times in the past and have enjoyed it. I was surprised to see they opened a location at City North, just a few minutes from my home. We decided to go and have some pizza and a few drinks on a Saturday night. I checked Opentable on Saturday afternoon and they had \"reservations\" available and I made a reservation for 7:15 for a party of 2. I received a confirmation and was all set....or so I thought.  I check in at the hostess station a couple of minutes before our reservation time and was told \"It's about a 25 minute wait for your table.\" Huh???? I have reservations- I'm even on time!!! A table should be reserved for me, right? Not so much. I ask the hostess why I have to wait at least 25 minutes for a reservation and she explains says \"We do reservations differently, you're added to the waiting list once you show up.\" I explain to her that's what you're telling me about is NOT a reservation, but rather a waiting list- a very big difference. Her response was we could dine at a couch (across from a very drunk looking couple- yes, at 7:15.) I again asked why a table isn't available for my reservation. Again, she says they do things differently and that on OpenTable it gives their reservation policy and that they ask everyone to call so they can explain how they do reservations differently. This policy is only shown after the reservation is made and in the confirmation email and reads \"...Please keep in mind our reservation policy is that we reserve the first available table at your reservation time so we cannot guarantee you will be seated at your exact reservation time....\" That isn't what they actually do and there is no mention to call about the reservation.   I know how reservations work- I make one, when I arrive a table is ready or will be ready within a few minutes. I shouldn't have to call to hear their interpretation on reservations- I've been making them for years. My suggestion to La Bocca- don't take reservations - you do not honor them in the first place. I'll skip La Bocca in the future. There are better options within a few minutes drive.  A couple of other notes- the place is small and was very crowded, thus very loud. The patio is very small and looked even more crowded. The bar is open seating- as it should be.  We ended up leaving and walking down to Kona Grill- they honored their reservations that I made on the OpenTable app while considering whether to dine at La Bocca or not."}
{"text":"Great wine, great food and great service. The house made flat bread is awesome. Bruschetta plank is wonderful!"}
{"text":"We went there last week at about 5 pm on a Wednesday and there were some tables full and some tables empty.  We were told we could only sit outside in the 110 degree weather because the empty tables,  which was about 1/2 the restaurant, were reserved.  You can only reserve tables with parties of 6 or more.  Also street parking was full so we had a nice hot walk back to the parking structure.  There are too many choices around to deal with that again."}
{"text":"We just stopped in for some drinks and a small bite to eat, but loved what we got! The bruschetta plates are great, we got the pesto one. Also had a wonderful tiramisu."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food is as we had 7:00 reservations and had to leave at 8:00 after not being seated. They told us it was hard to reserve tables in such a small venue.....why would you offer reservations then?!?! Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"The best hang on Mill for the over 21 crowd!  Pasta and pizza with great wine especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Service from Coco was top notch!  They know their food and wine parings - great happy hour, decent prices for fresh food prepared perfectly. 10-minute from the Marriott desert ridge. Nice outdoor patio. Would definitely go again.  Great adult venue."}
{"text":"Excellent wine and food! These wines you can't just get them at Total Wine or BevMo. Managing partner and Sommelier Mark Pope carefully selects varietals from regions all over the world that suit your mood.   It's one of those restaurants that makes you say, \"I want to have one of everything please!\" Be prepared to relax here for a while because it's not just a wine bar and urban kitchen, it is the atmosphere of love in every sip and bite. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor wine somalier and manager were very nice. Food was mediocre at best. Did like the med appetizer. Pizza had no flavor. Salad was drab too."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner with my bf here and absolutely love this place. I miss it and I'm definitely going to go back. It was one of those things where whatever you order is spot on! And as a surprise my bf ordered a brownie but there was some confusion and the pizza cookie came out instead but that was extremely indulgent and delicious too!! Keep it up La Bocca!! I love everything about this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to have some wine after a long day at work. The bartender was awesome and helped us select the perfect wine to go with the amazing bruschetta! We talked movies, the classics and what makes them classic and ended up closing the place down! I'd recommend the La Bocca experience to anyone and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The Sicily pizza was outstanding. Schreiner's Sicilian sausage, sundried tomatoes, Parmesan and goat cheese, shallots and Queen Creek EVOO for $13. Friendly staff and an inviting interior. A modern take on pizza with roasted tomatoes instead of a red sauce."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite location of both La Bocca restaurants. There menu is to die for obviously. The drinks are made to perfection. It's my favorite place to wine and dine for sure. Aaron's my favorite too. When you visit ask for him. He makes everyone's experience at La Bocca that much better!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon and got a \"side\" Caesar salad with a mini salmon for $18. LOL!! Luckily my man can afford such a misleading item on the menu, but really?? How pathetic can you be? Go to four peaks for a salmon Caesar and you'll get a full size piece of salmon with a full size salad for $16 :). Salad here had no flavor to top off the night. Idiots. Just another wannabe Italian restaurant that sucks underneath it all. We also had pizza and it was subpar.. Server was nice though, poor guy, you deserve to work somewhere better"}
{"text":"I really love La Bocca.   They have a good selection of wine and food.  At happy hour the wines start at $5 and are very good.  The food is also delicious - I love the bruschetta planks!  If you like wine and good snacks, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer I have to say that I'm a regular at the family of restaurants that brought this gem to this awesome neighborhood, so I'll try to report just the facts.  The decor and ambience is awesome. The detail of projecting a movie in the brick wall gives the place a unique charm.  The food was as good as the location in Tempe which from my point of view is awesome. This restaurant is my daughter's favorite place as well and believe me, she's not shy to tell what she thinks!  The massive bar is the perfect place to have a drink or a nice conversation with a friend (or date).  The wine list is great and balanced with a little bit of everything to please all kinds of tastes.  Did I mention that the prices are great? Just like the location in Tempe, you couldn't do any better with twice of the money.   Yes, I have to admit it, I just LOVE la Bocca.  Cheers!  PS it's sister location across the street is awesome as well (Modern Margarita). I could live the rest of my life going back and forth from one place to the other."}
{"text":"This was nice find. The staff was super helpful and attentive. The food was excellent. We had the calzones and they were amazing. Each calzone is more than enough for one person.  We went on a Friday night and there was live music which was very nice.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Fried ravioli, mixed drink, and wine were really good! Pizza was good, but didn't compare to MidiCi. Service and atmosphere were really good too, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Loved this place in Tempe, so glad its now just down the street. I can always count on a wonderful Med Plate. Everything is quality at this place."}
{"text":"4 words: Life-Changing-Garlic-Pizza. I can't even believe I've been to La Bocca almost a dozen times and overlooked this holy grail Garlic Pizza. I'm salvating just thinking about it! I also enjoy the Pesto Caprese sando (with turkey) + hand cut French fries, & the Mediterranean platter cuz the hummus and baba bomb!"}
{"text":"This place was so loud you could not hear the person next to you talking. The meatballs on the happy hour were not fit to eat.  We went outside as sat on patio to get a break and that was much better. The pizza looked really good and people were saying how good it was. I wish I had ordered that instead."}
{"text":"Decent wine list but the pours are a bit stingy and the food while good is expensive for what you get. That said, Happy hour is the time to go but outside of that...not my first choice in the area"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! Perfect a dinner for two or a family affair. They were very accommodating to my grandfather who has dietary issues and were more than happy to make our experience positive. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"My 5 stars is entirely for one item on this menu: The Porco Pizza. Their housemade dough topped with mozzarella cheese, slow roasted pulled pork, caramelized onions and serrano peppers and then woodfired to perfection (golden brown with just the smallest, light black spots here and there). When it comes to pizza I often like to stick to the basics or more traditional pies, my usual go to would either be supreme or just plain pepperoni, but with La Bocca it's gotta be the Porco. It's just that good.  It's been awhile since I have gone with friends and actually sat down, the last time I did it was the Mill location and service/atmosphere was solid, no complaints. I'm not sure if I'd like it as much here cause it is such a small location that it does seem a bit cramped. Anyways, I always just end up getting take out, the bartender has always been friendly and quick. Never keeps me waiting to pay or anything like that. If I do show up earlier than the food is finished, they usually give me a time estimate for how much longer and are always within a minute.   The pizza's there are 12-inch and the Porco comes out to $14 something after tax, so it is a bit pricier, although so worth it as a nice little treat after a long week or something. Plus, the 12-inch is still enough for my girlfriend and I or a friend and I to split as a small dinner, or take it home eat half by myself and have half the next day for a light lunch. If you go with another person and want to try it though but want a bit more food, you can always do another pizza or get their bruschetta which comes with 4 planks and they have like 6-8 different styles that you get to choose from for each plank. The bread/dough/all their ingredients really are amazing so it's hard to go wrong. I have never had any of their salads, but a friend got one once and she said it was really good.   Both this and the Tempe location have been putting out consistent quality food wise, haven't noticed a real difference there between the two. The Tempe location is definitely bigger though."}
{"text":"Todd took care of my friends and I last weekend and our service was phenomenal!! He was quite the jokester but also kept it professional. We originally sat outside but realized the table was a little too small for us to fully enjoy our first meal at La Bocca. Todd got us started with drinks, moved us inside right when a table was ready and continued to take care of us. Working in the service industry I know how important it is to have a good server and he exceeded that. The wine was great and the food was even better. This is definitely a new spot for my girlfriends and I! Thanks Todd!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  However, a bit obnoxious to charge .50 to put a sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Mussels, meatballs and several types of bruschetta.  TJ makes great cocktails!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but a little too loud for a quiet evening. That being said..... The service and food was really good."}
{"text":"Ok, I've given this place another try. Seems they have changed they're menu a bit (for the better) and I actually had a great time. Food was great service was still just ok. I could answer more questions than the waiter about the items, including the wine. Go for the atmosphere and food"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and a great location! This is a great place to wind down after work or for a date night. I like the small yet modern atmosphere. They have excellent pizza and salad selections and of course, wine. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this restaurant: location, bruschetta, ambience and customer service. The flatbread drizzled with balsamic was so great and was offered complimentary. The beautiful bruschetta planks were $5/off during Happy Hour as were our wine choices. We ended with a woodfired pizza and hot cookie dessert for our birthday girl. Our waitress was consistently attentive. We were happy to watch the Cubs game and drink some 312 beer as well"}
{"text":"The Med Plate is fabulous!  Great date place or just for dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's a great place to grab a bottle, or two, with your girls or go on a nice date :) service has always been fantastic. Normally because I am younger, I get treated differently ... But they held me to the same standard as the guy with the Rolex next to me! (As they should, I'm probably a better tipped). Anyways, cool little venue!"}
{"text":"We looked at the menu online and decided to try the Pear and Goat Cheese Salad.  The salads were delicious, fresh, and full of candied walnuts, craisins,  sliced pear, and a  light vinaigrette... Yum! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. A friend & I came here for happy hour/ a late lunch. Everything we ate was delicious, the wine was a good deal at $5 per glass, & the service was very attentive.  I'm not up in this area often, but next time I am, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here while vacationing in Phoenix a few weeks ago. We ordered the charcuterie plate, bruschetta plank, and a pizza to share. I pretty much loved everything about the charcuterie plate. It came with a quality assortment of meats and the addition of fruit mostarda and pickled veggies paired nicely. For the bruschetta, we went with the gorgonzola (my favorite), roasted baby beets (his favorite), fresh ricotta, and mozzarella. It somehow worked out that our #1 picks were the other person's least favorite one. We went with the porco as our pizza of choice which was a white pizza w/pulled pork. It was good, but we were pretty full by the time it came out and took most of it back with us. It made for a cold, yet still yummy breakfast the next morning!    Overall, it was a cute restaurant and worth checking out while in town. I'd definitely order the charcuterie plate again and try some more of their bruschettas!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection and food is fantastic. My husband loved their pasta!  Very cozy and great place to hang out.  Glad we found it. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"If you have even been to the La Boca on Mill Ave you know its a wonderful place to eat. Ever since they moved out and added this new location I am in Love. They have most wonderful wine selection, complete with house made grappa and lemoncellio. The Brushetta come out on large portions of house made dough complete with high dollar truffle Oil and Toppings. All the Pizza is made with the finest Elements they can find and has never been a disappointment for me! I love brings dates here too, some good wine, good pizza, and good company? what could be better?"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a couple weeks ago and let's just say we'll be back! The sangria was amazing and so was the pizza. Service was on point as well. Great atmosphere. I can definitely see myself enjoying wine here while chatting with friends."}
{"text":"I arrived to the area early for my hair appointment so I came into La Bocca for a glass of wine while I waited. I sat myself at the bar and waited almost 10 minutes before I walked out. There were two couples at the bar and one table. The bartender obviously knew the couple at the table and was chatting with them. As a former server, I'm all for engaging with your tables but not ignoring customers. He never acknowledged me or said \"hi, I'll be right with you\" and even when I walked out, he didn't say a word. Very disappointed in the service"}
{"text":"What a transformation from the former establishment this Group has made!! No expenses were spared by the Tempe Ownership Group for La Bocca  for this great City North destination.  This refreshing NEW look spared no expense and what a great feel from the street view on into the wine kitchen set up.  Mark Pope, a revered Valley Sommelier, and La Bocca's Management Team collaborated on Mark's vision for a world class wine experience (which includes a major education of Staff about the relationship between wine and food)  Many talk this talk, yet few have walked it.  Mark is uber passionate  with this mantra and when you add in the cuisine items there are marvelous synergies and execution on this theme.  For those of us living in this NE corridor, La Bocca Urban Kitchen could not have arrived at a better time.  Check it out and connect with Mark to both feel and hear his passion.  Then dance the dance in the ambience with the scintillating food and wine experience."}
{"text":"Love the food, wine and atmosphere. Very disappointed that they no longer take reservations for under 6 and that they are no longer on open table..."}
{"text":"Very cute place, the quality of the food was excellent.  Lunch menu had a lot of variety and was very reasonably priced, it allowed us to try more things.  Pizzas are fantastic!  Chicken Caesar was awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice service, cool decor. Aggressive misters outside so we sat inside. Pasta bolognese not great, did not like the sauce - it was fresh and homemade, but in my opinion not great flavor. My fiancé got chicken and it was amazing - moist and tasty. Unreal dessert - my favorite - skillet cookie which was the best one I've ever had (gooey on the inside). Date loved his dirty martini."}
{"text":"The clean slate martini is reason enough to come here - lemon, gin and cucumber.  Fabulous for the summer.    The mushroom truffle pizza was so good that despite my virtuous intentions to take some home for tomorrow's lunch, I ended up eating the entire thing.  (It was going to be soggy by the next day!  I know you understand.)"}
{"text":"It was my birthday dinner and I want to say using the OpenTable App for reservations was Awesome! When arrived we were nicely greeted and escorted to our table. Our waiter was nice but seemed rushed and did not ask if we had any question just if we needed more time to look the drink menu over. While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive I ordered 2 calamari appetizers. When he arrived back he only had one and we had to wait for the other. Again looking over menu he did not suggest anything or ask if we needed help in descriibing dishes. Just more time. We all placed our order and enjoyed the movie on the wall (very cool by the way). I loved the decor of restaurant but with it being so small it was on the loud side. Food arrived majority of the meals were spot on yummy. My prosciutto Alfredo was a little dry and some pasta stuck together but flavor was good. The bread that came with dish was phenomenal. My husband ordered salmon. He said it was supposed to have a balsamic reduction which it did not and only came with one nut for whole dish and rice was very plain. Again the rest of our party (4) meals were great. Pizza and bruschetta dishes. I do not think we will return which is sad because I loved the look and concept."}
{"text":"I love both locations of La Bocca! This one is less busy but has the same type of cozy atmosphere at the one in Tempe. Great relaxing place to dine & tons of yummy choices to choose from! Goat cheese & pear salad is to die for! I love coming here & will continue to return frequently."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour yesterday. The service was great. Our server was so sweet and fabulous. I liked her. We ordered sangrias, the red. They're delicious there. We also got some bruschetta. The mozzarella and pesto is my fave. I'd come back for just those. We also indulged in some tiramisu, it was amazing! I'll be for sure coming back."}
{"text":"Second time back in 12 months and wine is good but food not great. Caesar was good but pasta had no taste.  Maybe pizza would have been better.  Not sure I will try again.."}
{"text":"Great place for a glass of wine and talking with your date with a little live music in the background, a singer and his guitar while you are having great conversation. The customer service was phenomenal and so was the pizza. I recommend this place for a night out for casual conversations. Patio was peaceful and the weather was perfect. The wine was fabulous as well."}
{"text":"I love good wine and food.  Who doesn't?  This place delivers both, but the measly 4 ounce pours are totally ridiculous.  $13 for a glass of wine is a bit much.  I can go to Prime or Ocean Club and pay the same price and get a nice pour.  This is the only downside to this place.  FYI-I have tried several salads, bruschetta from the menu and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Their porco pizza is amazing.  Charcuterie board is also great.  Wife had the sangria and neither of us cared for it as it had a sour/floral taste to it.  Besides that minor complaint we'd absolutely return.  Good atmosphere and great food make this a place you should check out."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Amazing italian food , service and atmosphere, every time!"}
{"text":"Sangria was delish and the service was good. We liked the bruschetta and the med plate we got to start but the pizza was disappointing. It was undercooked and underwhelming. Probably wouldn't go back for pizza but may go back for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"High Street (formerly known as CityNorth) is one of those developments from Phoenix's glory days that has always seemingly been on the brink of explosive growth while also on the brink of eminent closure.  The complex is a mix of retail, office, and residential spaces (many of which have been vacant since day one) as well as a massive swath of dirt that is still as yet undeveloped.  The area has potential, but it also has the potential to go under.  Amongst the instability, La Bocca's newest location is probably the signature restaurant of this fledgling complex.  Tonight I was invited here for a little holiday season get together with some friends.  For the record I have not yet been to La Bocca's original location Tempe so I can't compare this location with the original.  But the menu and atmosphere at least appears to emulate the original location as an urban themed pizzeria and wine bar.  A somewhat similar setup to Postino's but with more of an emphasis on the Italian main courses.  The location is fairly small, but has ample seating inside and out with a mix of bar seating and couches throughout.  We opted for high table seating in the middle of the restaurant this go around.  We all started with a round of drinks.  The wine selection is pretty respectable and they've got a full bar if you're in the mood for something else.  They also have bruschetta plates (again, similar to Postino's), but I went straight for a main course this time.  I went with the Rustic Marinara pasta (more or less their take on a spaghetti and meatballs).  The meatballs were a super tasty mix of beef and pork.  The thick cut noodles were also quite good.  The sauce was fairly average and the garlic bread was pretty forgettable, but overall it was a decent dish.  For dessert, I went with their cast iron chocolate brownie with ice cream.  Effectively their own miniature version of Oregano's Pizzookie.  It was adequate, but yeah Oregano's does it way better.  Total tab for my glass of wine, pasta, brownie, tax and tip came to about $40.  No complaints about the service as our waiter was hamming it up with our whole group and was very attentive and timely in getting us our food and drinks.  And as a place to get drinks with a group, La Bocca is a pretty cool hangout spot.  But the main dishes just didn't impress me that much (certainly not for the price I paid).  I'd happily recommend folks try this place for a happy hour group outing.  But purely as a sit down restaurant, La Bocca's High Street location could use some work.  Eventually I'll try their original location in Tempe.  Hopefully that location has mastered both the food and drink elements of a great wine bar, the way Postino's has."}
{"text":"I thought I was not going to like this place.  The first time I came, I was not in a very good mood, so I left without trying anything.  The second time, I came with my girlfriends.  We had 14 ladies and we had a really great time.  Service was good and the food was very good.  We had a few pizzas, the med plate and a couple of salads.  My favorite is the med plate, it was hummus, baba ganoush, olives, cheese, peppers, couples of different breads, this is really awesome and big enough to share with a few friends.  Last time I was there, 4 of us shared that plate.  The wine list is good, my only issue is that the glasses of wine are a little pricey.  Most of the ones I can have are over $13, but that won't deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"I cant believe it has taken me this long to try this place. But, fortunately I am glad we gave it a try!   Started off with the Steamed Mussels: White wine brodo, herbs, and artisan toast. They were a perfect way to start off. Light in their decadent whine sauce and they were not gritty as they sometimes can be.   To drink I got their house Red Sangria. No complaints.  Then for dinner a Porco Pizza: Mozzarella, roasted pulled pork, caramelized onions, serrano chilis, Queen Creek EVO, and herbs. If only this pizza were a tad bit bigger. It was scrumptious!! The caramelized onions went so well with the pulled pork, and the serrano chilis gave it a little kick.   We sat at the bar and were served by a very nice young man. The atmosphere was very cute and cozy. We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in there today during happy hour and were not disappointed. A very friendly and attractive's death. Tony, the bartender was especially helpful and a lot of fun.  My wife and I had sandwiches and they did not disappoint. We tried some Italian wine and it was scrumptious. I would highly recommend La Bocca."}
{"text":"Love the ambience! The bruschetta and garlic fries were excellent. The smoked Alfredo pasta had a touch too much orange zest, but it was still great. They were also nice enough to give us a free dessert for no reason! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We are here a few nights ago and man did we have good time! Everything was perfect from the waiter to the food drinks. This was our second date this year since our twins were born and couldn't have picked a better place. Our cocktails were amazing, wine was perfect, and the food we ordered was incredible! We started off with the bruschetta planks (smoked prosciutto \"best\", gorgonzola, roasted baby beets, and Spanish) then I had Caesar salad with entry, and Pasta Bolognese. The pasta was just right and definitely hit the spot! My wife had a salad but honestly don't remember which one it was. I do know she loved it because she devoured it, lol. Finally desert!! My wife got the crème brûlée, and I got a barrel aged Manhattan! Both were beyond perfect, and my drink didn't have a bite in the throat like most hard liquor. It went down smooth like a glass of water (in a good way!) I would recommend this place to anyone, and loved the soft lights with loft style setting inside."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sat outside with misters. The service was perfect.  The orange blossom martini was amazing; fresh squeezed orange juice!  We had the brushetta plank and it was delicious.  The chicken caeser salad was perfect.  The two pizzas were delicious - definitely can tell the house made crust and high quality ingredients. The cookie/ice cream dessert was yummy too.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food for happy hour.  We always get a pizza and an antipasto plate.  They have an extensive wine selection also.  During happy hour, you will probably find some of the lesser know labels and varietals available, and I haven't had one that was bad.  If you like to drink more commercial labels, those are available also, along with a full bar.  Atmosphere is great, it can get a little crowded during prime hours on the weekend so be prepared to rub shoulders with some of the great clientele that always seems to be here.  La Bocca is a great choice to spend your dollars when enjoying High Street."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Good Happy Hour menu, although limited. Wait staff attentive. Downsides: Had fried ravioli. Nice touch, but the cheese was not Ricotta, but some Mex cheese, that did not sit well. The brochette was pretty typical of places that serve it, with a number of options. Not bad..but not the best of all in town. Home made fries with pork belly was a bit different...and good. Cocktail menu is creative and that was good. Not impressed but no complaints."}
{"text":"A modern/chic restaurant with a smooth vibe. Great happy hour including $5 off all wine by the glass! Friendly attentive and hospitable servers. A true north Scottsdale gem :)   A few faves: MED PLATE CHICKEN PESTO PIZZA TRUFFLE FRIES  BEETS SALAD    ****hot skillet cookie and brownie available also*****"}
{"text":"Salads and pizzas are great! The atmosphere is very relaxed. Great place for a date or a chill night with friends. One thing I noticed is their wine pours are on the smaller side. Not a huge deal but other than that it's a great place with great food. Oh, I almost forgot... The cookie dessert! It's so delicious. I'll keep going back just for that."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at La Bocca today with an excellent pizza and drink. Good service and wonderful atmosphere with a warm vibe. Candyse, the server/bartender, was pleasant and attentive. Large selection of wine and other drinks. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to hear a new place opened at city north. I joined my girlfriend last night for dinner and was super disappointed. We sat down next to a couple who sent back their meal....not a good sign. We ordered bruschetta and quinoa salad (extra $2 to split). Once we devoured our bruschetta we sat for about 40min realizing our salad was not going to come. The server came back and admitted he forgot to put our salad in...no big deal...then the salad came and it was literally the dinkiest thing I've ever seen. You can't call something a salad unless their is some sort of greens in it right? It was quinoa and pomegranate...maybe lemon juice. The server who was very apologetic came back and we let him know how we felt especially after being hungry and waiting 1.5 hours. He took our \"salads\" and said the chicken caesar was \"hearty\". We waited another 45min to be just as unhappy as before. The manager came out apologized and brought creme brule (which was the best thing we ate).  Sangria: No fruit in it  : ( and usually I don't like sweet drinks but this needed a little more sweetness to it, so it was ok.  Bruschetta: $12 for 4 pieces. The salami, pear, prosciutto, and ricotta were all tasty but nothing spectacular. If I am comparing to Postinos they were smaller and not as  filling. I was still starved after sharing it.  Caesar: No dressing, 2 little pieces of chicken, and it was all croutons. Not \"hearty\"!  The server was pretty good but overall it should not take 3 hours for bruschetta and salad on a Thursday evening at 7:30pm. I will give the place another shot but I think this location needs to make some changes considering we weren't the only people with complaints. I live down the street and love to support the local restaurants so I hope they make some changes!"}
{"text":"I judge restaurants on three key criteria: food, ambiance, and service.   In this case, while the other criteria are worth mentioning, I will start with the service, which was the most significant fail of the evening and thus the aspect I will recall most formidably upon making future dining decisions.  Immediately upon entering, the host asked if we had a reservation, which, as a moderately priced pizza joint in N. Scottsdale which issues LivingSocial deals, came across as pretentious and unnecessary. In any case, my date and I were promptly sat outside in the end of a large high-top table already filled with another party. This would have been okay, but the party was (admittedly so) loud and rather vulgar. They apologized repeatedly in recognition of their poor behavior, but it didn't change the fact. It would have been better if we were being taken care of well by our server, but they had a different staff member. They were eating, drinking, and being merry with a highly attentive member of the waitstaff, while we sat starving with empty water glasses for most of the night without any sort of attention at all (see details below).  After sitting for what seemed like an eternity without notice, our server finally arrived and asked if wanted water. We order still and sparkling, and said we may order drinks in a moment. Fifteen minutes later, we received the water, my date order a draft Nitro Milk Stout (note solid draft beer selections available). My server REPEATEDLY asked if I wanted wine. It came across as a ploy to up the tab, and I assured him that if I wanted wine I would say so (thank you SO much for your attention on the matter).   He left to fetch the beer, and returned again 15 minutes later without said beverage. He took our order, and we reminded him of the stout order. He finally brought it and AGAIN asked if I wanted a cocktail. I declined, again, and that was the end of him almost for the rest of the entire night.   Mussels took about 20 minutes, salad showed up 20 minutes following that, and FINALLY the pizza 30 minutes after the salad. The food was solid, but we're talking about service so I'll get back to that. At this point, the server was simply MIA. Bussers, other servers, and the food expediter did provide us with moderate service (water, red pepper, etc.), but only when flagged down and asked explicitly for assistance.   With that said, a note on food: 1. Mussels: Solidly cooked in a white wine lemony broth. Good texture, but nothing out of the ordinary. 2. Beet salad: Totally delicious, with an excellent balance of three different kinds of beets and a lovely heirloom tomato salad offset by fresh, peppery arugula, a sprinkle of barely caramelized walnuts, and goat chess. It was a subtle sweetness that really highlighted the beets and tomato without overpowering them.  3. Autumn Pizza: So good. The crust was just perfect with a charred crispness on the outside with a light doughy-ness on the inside. Blue cheese was certainly noticeable but well balanced with the roasted veggies and balsamic reduction.    This would be an entirely different review if the service/ambiance matched the quality of the food.   The food was gone, and the server returned to ask how everything was and to drop the check. I had a living social deal, but was informed it was only good from Sun-Thurs. It did not clearly say that on the voucher, but I trust it's in the fine print. That is SUCH a scam, and only infuriated me more after the complete lack of service. The server informed us that \"See, we're busy on the weekends so we don't need that. It's slower during the week so we're trying to get people in here.\"   Well, if they are SO busy during the weekends, they clearly do not need our business. The mussels/salad/beer/sparkling water/pizza was $51, so not so cheap I can overlook the total service fail. They acted as though didn't need our business, and certainly didn't want it. Thus, while I will return to use my LivingSocial during the week, I will return their attitude towards me and not ever return for a third time.  For a failing shopping area hidden behind Desert Ridge (CityNorth, which my date characterized as the post-Apocalyptic urban cityscape), you'd think they'd go over and above. I'll stick to the Mill location, which beats this place on every account."}
{"text":"Came in for Happy Hour and really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was cold outside and the coziness was perfect. Can't do a full review cause we only had one drink and an appetizer. The wine list was very interesting, not your run of the mill!!! Will be back to try more."}
{"text":"First time at this location and in love! Great place for happy hour with friends or a date. Love their wine selection and food. Bruschetta will never be as good as Postinos, but that is impossible to beat! The salads and pizza are delicious. The only thing I miss from the Mill Ave location is cucumbers in my water. That is definitely not enough to change the star count though."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   A coworker recommended La Bocca. Her description did not match the reality for us.  We went on a Thursday night around 630pm. We were seated immediately and told our server would be right with us. Our waitress came out, introduced herself, and said she would bring us water and that she would be right back. She brought us water and we ordered Bruschetta and drinks. Bruschetta took about 25 minutes to come out (surprising since it was slow in the restaurant). Once it arrived, we asked for drinks again and they were brought without apology. Our waitress did not come back for another 20 minutes or so. Bruschetta was gone and drinks were empty. She asked if we wanted anything else...We wanted to order dinner. It would have been nice if she had checked on us sooner so we could have put our order in. Food came out (Autumn pizza and  gongonzola/pear salad). Pizza had  soggy bottom and was very one note. Salad was delicious and the best part of the meal.   We ordered a skillet brownie and were told it would be out shortly...It took 30 minutes. Not a huge deal but not what I expected. It would has been nice for our waitress to warn us it took so long.   Biggest complaint was the service. Our waitress did not check on us regularly. We were there for about 2 hours. There was a table behind us that came in after us, ordered the same amount of food, and left easily 30 minutes before us. They had a different server who was very attentive. I was tempted to ask him to take over our table. Our waitress only came to the table when bringing food/clearing the table. She did not check on us in between. There were less than 10 parties in the restaurant and 3 servers and a hostess so I thought this was a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the crew, and the pizza is delicious.  The happy hour menu is great also."}
{"text":"My wife and I Love the place.  Been many times now. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable. If you ask about a dish they can tell you every item on the dish.  Everything We've tried on the menu is absolutely delicious.  The Bruschetta pick 4 is really good and a good value.  The antipasto plate was delicious with the roasted garlic and pesto. The prosciutto wrapped goat cheese was good but you need to like tomatoes.   Charcuterie Plate was good, my wife enjoyed it.  I didn't care for the fruit mostarda.  The Fried Calamari with lemon zest, smoked paprika, citrus aioli was top notch.    Really good Happy Hour Food and drink menu.  You can get steamed mussels, bocca fries, fried ravioli, homemade meatballs, select bruschetta  $5 off every glass of wine, $2 off draft beers, and $2 off single liquor drinks from 3-6:30pm daily. They have a huge whiskey list, lots of good wines to choice from and draft beer.    The place is very clean, including the bathrooms. The patio is a great place to enjoy.  Nothing but good things to say about them, just wish they were closer."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Really cute gals ! I eat here 6 times a week ! I won't eat anywhere else"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The bruschetta is a great starter for everyone to nibble on as you enjoy the ambiance and relaxed vibe of this wine bar. They're house wines are absolutely delicious as well, and if you are interested in trying something new they are very well educated about pairings and choices for your liking. They even bring you a sample if you are having trouble deciding which one to choose! I have had multiple combinations of their pizzas, but I always LOVE the bocca trio. I have had the salads and pasta dishes, and they NEVER disappoint. Such a wonderful spot in City North, MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner and were sadly disappointed in the food.  The service was GREAT, very friendly and attentive, restaurant is very cool but the food was totally bland. I ordered Mussels limone - pasta with lemon garlic caper sauce, mussels and lemon zest - sounds delicious right? Absolutely NO flavor or seasoning. Literally tasted of boiled pasta with mussels on top. Very disappointing. Kids ordered pepperoni pizza and again, was just extremely bland, no flavor or seasoning.  To be fair, the server did not charge us for the 2 pasta dishes which was appreciated but I would have preferred a tasty meal in the first place.  This was our second visit to this restaurant as the first visit was the same - bland food - but we decided to give it another try. Sadly, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Dinner work meeting. No frills expected. Seating was prompt and servers very attentive and food was good. All good here!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for early lunch and found they have half price bottles of wine all day Sunday. Score!  It's a super cute space. Kinda retro but also modern. Good music playing but not too loud.   There was only one other table of two when we arrived but everything seemed to take forever. We got a bottle of bubbles (2nd choice since they were out of what we wanted). I ordered a house salad and a margarita pizza. Hubby ordered the Italian sandwich which was a combo of Italian meats on sourdough.   My house salad came out first and even though it was simple (mixed greens, tomato, cucumber and blue cheese with a vinaigrette) it was quite good. Not over dressed. Very fresh. Then we waited. And waited. The table that came in after us got served their meals. Then finally we got ours.   Hubby said his sandwich was excellent and finished the whole thing which is proof that he loved it. My margarita pizza was - well, bland. I added pepper flakes and the Parmesan they brought to the table but it just lacked flavor. In my opinion you can't really ruin pizza and it wasn't bad it just wasn't really \"good\" either. I don't think I'd order it again. I would, however, go back for the house salad and something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and wine bar with many positives. My party was originally sat at a table with couches more suitable for drinks and the hostess and waitress had no problem switching us to a more traditional table when one opened up. The staff in general were nice, especially our attentive waitress and the knowledgable owner. It was refreshing to see the owner be actively involved and on the floor of the restaurant. The wine selection was good and is reportedly growing as the restaurant establishes itself and the food (appetizer, entree and desert) was above average in taste and presentation. The only qualm I have is the noise level but what do you expect from a happening place? Will definitely drink and dine again!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 12 on a Wed. night around 5pm. We got a nice long table on the patio that was perfect for us. I noticed some nice couch sectionals in groups that would have worked too. The outside was full and a few places taken on the inside. I got the bruschetta; 4 types for $12. They had several options and I enjoyed all of them. On happy hour you can get a glass of wine for $5-$10, depending upon the type. I got one of the house wines and it was good for $5. Service was good and everyone had a great time. This is a good date night place; have a drink or two and a small plate here then walk across the street to Blue Martini for some dancing."}
{"text":"City North is an okay place to hang out, and it's in the middle for west and east valley friends alike, so we tried this place out. The bruschetta is pretty good. I think the prices are a little high, but those that are on High street/City North tend to be so that wasn't a surprise. I gotta say I've tried 6 or 8 of their red wines, and I didn't like any of them enough to drink more than a glass. The whiskey selection is minimal. It's probably pretty good for a happy hour spot, but it isn't quite what I need it to be for a night of drinking or to become a regular."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is really good and the service is great. The La Boca pizza is one of my favorites and the bruschetta planks are AWESOME."}
{"text":"Wine was great however waiter brought us appetizers and we found a hair in our prosciutto. No apology but just brought another appetizer out. We didn't want anything free but an apology would've been nice."}
{"text":"This review is based on only one lunch visit.  We came for lunch and saw salads sandwiches and mostly pizza and the menu. I am very torn between three and four stars and three stars because the majority of lunch sandwiches are made with Boarshead lunch meat. I do purchase Boarshead lunch meat from the store but I don't go out to eat Boarshead lunch meat.  I went with a seasonal salad. It was made with lightly grilled peaches, candied walnuts burrata cheese, a nicely toasted crusty piece of bread, and I had chicken added on for an additional charge. Overall it was a nice salad. I thought it could use a little fresh herb to brighten it up but overall it was good.  My husband had a pizza. It was thin with puffy edges and was made with mozzarella and fontina cheese. I tried a little bit of it and the crust had a nice flavor to it. The sauce was thin and the cheese was melted nicely.  Service was very attentive.  Atmosphere is a mix of modern and old. This is a place for wine lovers because they offer an above average wine selection.  They also offer comfortable looking outdoor dining.  Overall a nice experience with attentive service in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to Yelp and Opentable, the service was very good and the food was excellent.  I tried the Pesto Caprese sandwich using thier homemade bread, very very good adn finished my meal off with creme brulee, also very good.  The resturant had a nice ambiance that was a bit up scale."}
{"text":"While 3 of us waited for a table, my friend and I decided to go to the bar to order drinks while we waited to be seated.  Every seat was taken except 1 stool.  My friend approached it, to order us a round of drinks. The bartender saw us and I figured he would come back to get our order. Ok 10 min pass, now 15 min, and no one new has come up to the bar. A few more minutes pass and a guy shows up and the bartender starts striking conversation with him. Hello, but we still haven't placed our order, nor does he care to acknowledge us standing there. Our 3rd friend, sitting down waiting for our table, is looking at us if we've ordered drinks and my friend and I make the decision that we need to leave and go elsewhere. Just as we walked away from the bar, towards our friend who is waiting, the hostess had our table ready.    The wait didn't bother us, we didn't have reservations but being completely ignored by the bartender is unacceptable. We were trying to show our out of town friend how friendly Phoenix is.  Not here, take your business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the food was good and their happy hour specials are really good. They have a nice patio and it's usually pretty empty so the seating is abundant. Good little spot. Will be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a laid back place for happy hour with a couple friends, La Bocca is perfect. Every time I've been there the servers have been very friendly and knowledgeable about different wines. The patio is lovely when the weather is nice and the inside is also comfortable. I've mostly gone for happy hour and appetizers and I recommend the beet salad. If you have a group of more than 6 you may need to plan ahead or hang out in the bar area. This is a very chill spot for friends, dates, or even to bring family for some catch up time."}
{"text":"Trendy wine bar with great bruschetta options.  The servers and drinks are great and responsive.  Sitting outside is better as long as the weather cooperates otherwise go for inside during the summer.  The salads are creative and the pizza is fresh and uses the best ingredients. Don't ask them to modify the pizza though (like extra sauce) - they are not good at that part. This is one of my regular places when I need to unwind after work or spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.  But trust me on the bruschetta."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant/bar for a family member's birthday celebration. Unfortunately, there was a party still sitting at our reserved table (reservations were called about 3-4 days in advance for a party of 12 guests). Very appreciative of the staff letting us know this information instead of having us just wait around, but half of our party was awkwardly seated on the other half of the other party's table and the rest had to find an open table to sit around them and wait for the other party to leave. It was a bit of a mess at first, but once we were situated it went well after that. Our waiter was very attentive and quick to meet our needs. Overall, I would recommend the location for a party no bigger than 6 since it's a pretty compact space."}
{"text":"Tried it out here for dinner this past weekend. First off, beautiful restaurant. Really unique decor. Old movie playing on the wall. Just lovely.   We got some drinks first. Sangria was delicious!!  The started with the peach salad. Nothing special and needed more flavor.   Then we ordered bruschetta and a chicken dish. Both were very good. The chicken was warm and moist, but small. Bruschetta was delicious but not as good as Postinos.   Overall, the food was good. Would go back again because it's a great and cozy date spot."}
{"text":"La Bocca in Tempe, AZ is one of my favorite restaurants when I visit my wife's family multiple times throughout the year.  So, when I was working in North Scottsdale area and discovered there was an alternate location, I insisted my co-workers all meet there for dinner.  This location is similar in design with a really nice outdoor space and great atmosphere.  We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress right as we sat down asking for our drink order.  20 minutes later the hostess actually noticed we did not have our drinks nor any water on the table.  She came over to inquire and promised to get after our waitress.  In the meantime, we started watching the staff and how they were interacting with their customers.  All but our waitress were hustling to get food and drinks out to their tables.  After another 10 minutes went by before our drinks came out (we think she forgot to place the order).  I noticed the hostess talking to our waitress again and from that point forward all was good.  The food and drinks were excellent.  The antipasta plate and the bruschetta options make great starters. The salmon was excellent too.  I highly recommend La Bocca, even with the rough start to the evening."}
{"text":"Organic local produce, amazing creations, great service and a wonderful wine list. I need to find more places like this in North Phoenix"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to this amazing restaurant. From the moment we arrived the atmosphere was fantastic they had live music playing so we sat on the patio because the weather is now perfect.  Ordered a bottle of wine and decided to start with the muscles and created our own select bruschetta. Pick Four for $13.95 I would recommend picking all of them and spending twice the money the bread was amazing and the flavors are out of this world.  Hands down excellent choice great environment definitely coming back."}
{"text":"It certainly looks the part of a sleek urban wine bar. Unfortunately the menu struggles to hold up its end of the bargain.  The solid bruschetta overshadows a pizza that is very underwhelming when set side by side to other Neapolitan pies in the Valley. Way too much crust and it was difficult to make out the flavor from the San Marzano tomatoes."}
{"text":"Great wine. Poor menu and food. I won't be back.  But if you are going for nice wines and  pretty women and don't care about the food, then this might work for you."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We had to go outside because it was a bit loud. I think that our server had too many tables.  Our drinks ran dry."}
{"text":"Great ambience, cocktails and starters. We like to sit at the bar. Really nice. Very rustic with a pop of orange for color. We'll defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Come during happy hour, so you can have the best deal on drinks! The service is always top notch. They have a good selection of wine, great appetizers, the best fancy pizza, and you should definitely make room For the desserts:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting another restaurant nearby, having a few drinks and we noticed the outdoor seating and line of patrons at La Bocca across the street. We needed to have dinner, so we made our way over and were seated in a nice cozy spot.   We enjoyed a few of the bruschettas and a wood fired pizza, but what made the experience memorable was the sommelier, Mark. Mark is a very well versed man when it comes to understanding food pairings and wine. He introduced us to a new wine label called Mt.Brave, and we instantly found a new fave syrah. He also had tried to introduce us to another wine, which we did not like and he didn't make us pay for it. We ended up having two bottles of the Mt. Brave, which is not an inexpensive bottle and the manager comped us a couple apps for our patience. Our patience? We were fine, they were the ones who were very patient as we tried the wines to see what we liked best.   The atmosphere is trendy, it gets packed around happy hour, but it is located at City North, one of my favorite spots in North Phoenix, and the seating is comfortable and cozy, with a mix of tables and booths with pillows and splashes of color (desert tones) all around. The servers are always happy to see you and honestly, due to this great vibe, we became regulars.   Having moved away from Arizona, I can say I miss La Bocca, as I introduced several friends to the hot spot and they are constantly rubbing my nose in the fact that they just :checked in: to La Bocca.   Miss your food, your spirits, and your fun times La Bocca. Take Care."}
{"text":"Husband loves this place. I do too, a great spot for date nights, but I eat a mostly vegan diet so finding something to eat here can be a bit of a challenge for me. Can't let that affect my review though since the food I have had and the drinks are great, not every place can accommodate every diet and I get that. Vibe is amazing, love the live music. Good volume and always good talent. The outdoor seating area of this place is super cute. Very classy establishment and although it always seems busy I've never had an issue getting seated quickly with good quick service."}
{"text":"We had yet another great experience here! Mussels Rustico was fabulous! Our waiter was very attentive and the wine pairing was exceptional. A great sexy little place."}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza ever! Great ambiance. Fun and lively atmosphere! Take friends, share, drink wine and have fun! Can't go wrong with any selections!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband around 430 to eat here before going to a movie. The place was half full. We both had pizza, which were fantastic!     The service was horrible though! We were planning on having an appetizer and dessert as well but the server was chatting away with half of the staff over by the bar and took too much time. It took him 20 minutes to come back to take our order after taking our drink order. He was very unfriendly and seemed disinterested. Then it took 25 minutes for 2 pizzas to come out. They were delicious but not that good to wait 25 minutes. The server never came by to even ask how everything was; he was too busy chatting with the other staff. We then had to skip dessert because we were going to miss our movie.  With a restaurant half full, they shouldn't have such slow service!  Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Enjoy lunches here. Its a good place to get a quick lunch if needed. I typically get the chicken Caesar and it does not disappoint.  Had a group with me order the pizza and it looked really good. My fav is they have Scottsdale Blonde on tap. Great little place in a trendy area."}
{"text":"Had a nice time sitting outside good conversation and good food. The appetizers were very good we had the med plate and the one with the pesto and garlic spread.  The reason for the three stars because the food wasn't that good.  I ordered stuffed chicken which didn't have a lot of flavor. My husband ordered the chicken breast and said the same thing. Our friends had the pasta and the mussels of which only the mussels were good and he sent the pasta back because it wasn't good and barely had any meat.  All and all we would go back for drinks and apps but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Great later place and ambiance. Nice cocktail and wine selection. Fantastic pesto bruchetta...a must try. Very cozy and fantastic staff. Very welcoming...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"La Bocca is the perfect casual date night spot. I have been to this location at least a million times and always have a great experience. Their happy hour is fun, and it's not too pricey of a restaurant otherwise. The charcuterie plate and cheese plate are must order appetizers. They are HUGE and come with a ton of goodies. My favorite is the pesto sauce and olive tapenade. The citrus aioli that comes with the calamari is amazing, but the serving size is pretty tiny. For pizzas I recommend the truffled mushroom the porco. The truffle isn't overwhelming and the porco pizza has a great flavor from the Serrano chilies.   Service here is always good, and with the great food and atmosphere it has been in steady rotation for some time!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes to have a nice dinner here before a movie. We had a reservation, but our table was not ready.  We eventually sat down and our waitress was very nice, but the service was terrible. We ordered olives right away, plus a salad and entrees. We had to ask about our olives and then everything came out all at once. Also, we ordered a glass of wine with our meal and it arrived as we were finishing."}
{"text":"This is the third restaurant that's been in this space and I hope that they stick around for a long while.  I sat at the bar and had a beet salad to go along with my sausage pizza.  The salad was one of the best I've ever had and the pizza was tasty as well.  They have a nice wine selection and were kind enough to let me taste a couple before settling on a pleasant red blend."}
{"text":"Wow great little spot with excellent people watching. They have a great drink happy hour with wines being either $5 off or $5 a glass  depending on the price of the wine. Their Bruschetta planks were pretty good  however the brie cheese and marmalade one, be warned that the marmalade takes over so if you like marmalade you will love it. Otherwise skip it. :( Bummer but otherwise the rest were good. All in all still a great place to come, have a few glasses of wine, some food and chat it up ( great date night as well hint hint)"}
{"text":"The food and service are consistently outstanding.  Ty, Manager, and Amber-Leigh, Server, always provide first class service and always exceed expectations.  I highly recommend that you visit this fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Todd was our waiter & was amazing!!! Was super nice & friendly! The skillet cookie was also AWESOME"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, loved they were playing Ferris Buhlers day off on their projector. Their drinks and happy hour are nice. My group got the 'med plate' which was really good and enough for 4 people. Only reason for removing 2 stars was the service. I didn't catch his name, in fact now that I think about it he never gave it to us, but our server was very rude. Only checked on us twice (we were there 2 hours and it wasn't that busy) never offered us dinner. When we were ready to leave we asked for our bill and he never delivered so we had to ask another server. I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and try again hopefully it was an off night for him."}
{"text":"Food and service were great!!! I loved the Pesto Caprese sandwich and their house dressing is amazing! I want to try their pizzas for sure."}
{"text":"Well let's start with \" the Mouth\" that's what it's called in Italian really but the place does look really nice very inviting , but then it starts the hostess sat us down and waited for over 15 mins. Had to get up to ask the hostess to send a waiter, and our waiter was serving a table right next to us and was at that table twice . So we where ready to order drinks and food. Ok we took our 13 year old son so I ordered and asked if they had a marinara sauce pasta they said yes , my wife then said please make sure it's plain just sauce and pasta  ok  \" marinara sauce\" is just plain tomato sauce with garlic and basil  anyone that has any sense , well he got it with chunks of cheese and mushrooms and it had 2 meatballs in it but we didn't say anything I got a salad with chicken still looking for the chicken and my wife ordered a pizza with spinach and basil and chicken the bottom was burnt and pizza was dry .  But not to bitch to much if you want appetizers like anti-Pasta a plate of cheese and olives , or bruschetta and wine this is the place don't order dinner. Remember my review this  place will only last year to year and half"}
{"text":"Great hangout and lounge spot! The olive plate appetizer was amazingly tasty ! Great wine selection"}
{"text":"Was in for dinner tonight with friends. Service was slow, food had zero taste. Spent way too much time and way too much money to ever consider this restaurant again. I understand they were probably understaffed for a Monday but in the service industry that's no excuse. I will never suggest this restaurant to anyone and I will never return. One positive I can take away from this experience is knowing that I don't ever have to drive back up to this restaurant. Don't waste your time or money. Trust me. Garbage."}
{"text":"We stopped here for happy hour. It was pretty packed but servers did their best to keep up. The special cocktails were great, as was the house sangria. We got a few happy hour appetizers and they were delicious! It's also in a very cute area with  shopping and other restaurants."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out last for our date night. We really enjoyes ourselves. Great ambiance and service. We tried the bruschett's, great especially the tomatoe and pesto. The smoked prosciutto alfredo was amazing as was the boca trio pizza. We will be back."}
{"text":"I feel immediately obligated to write this review because as a mom and parent, any situation that threatens the safety of my child or anyone else's child should be made aware of right away.  With prevalence of children born with life threatening peanut or nut allergies, if a restaurant is going to make a sauce deviating from standard recipe, it should be clearly printed on the menu.  My son who is severely allergic to peanuts and allergic to other nuts (walnut, almond, cashew) ordered their pesto chicken pizza. I mistakenly assumed their pesto was made from pine nuts and didn't even think to ask what the ingredients were. When my son ate his slice he started to scratch his throat told me his throat was scratchy then I noticed his lips started to swell up. He was having an allergic reaction and I was confused cause I knew he was not allergic to pine nuts. Turns out their pesto sauce is made from walnuts!!! Luckily for my son he is not severely allergic to walnuts but I shudder to think what could have happened if he was!!!  La Bocca should clearly have this ingredient printed on their menu for the sake of adults and children with nut allergies. I mean, seriously! And parents- this is another lesson one can never be too careful. Doesn't matter who you might think it annoys- for any sauce or mixture- ask!!!! I am just thankful my son is okay . . . Bottom line is their pesto is made with walnuts so if you have a nut allergy do not order any item with pesto!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time with my buddy and I already love this place. Thank you Michael for providing such a kicka** experience I'll definitely be coming back soon!   Overall 10/10"}
{"text":"Great place for date night! The bruschetta planks they serve here? are probably one of my favorite appetizers of all time. The pizza here has the most perfect crust and is definitely worth getting. My only gripe is the selection of beers on tap but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"High Street is always a good time. The whole area is beautiful and thriving with large amounts of business. La Bocca is my favorite spot of all; along with Modern Margarita.  The food is top notch, management is always kind, and I love the plush lounge couches in the dead center.  Above all, the La Pinta Margarita is OFF THE HOOK. For anyone who has never had La Pinta, it is Clase Azul's Pomegranate Tequila Liqueor. It's unreal. They make a great Sazerac and old world cocktails as well.  My only reason for not the full five stars, is that the place is usually somewhat empty... And of the four times I've been here, only once was the service memorable. It was a younger gentlemen, early 20s..."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Expected more and menu very limited.  Service was just OK.  Not sure what they really want to be.  Country music playing was very confusing."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday where they have select bottle of wine half off.  So that was nice.  The Antipasti plate was phenomenal.  The prosciutto filled with goat cheese was excellent.  The Salami and cheese with Olives, pesto and Dijon mustard were very good.  The house salad was good.  Fresh and crisp with just the right cover of Balsamic Vinegarette dressing.  My wife had the Alfredo Pasta.  She said it was good.  I had the Mussels Limone.  There was too much Mussels broth over the pasta which ruined the pasta.  It was okay but I wouldn't get it again.  Service was excellent from start to finish."}
{"text":"Went to La Bocca for an after work drink and to have some dinner. Started our night with the bruschetta appetizer (they are on the happy hour menu for $3 each so we got all four that are offered) and the calamari. The bruschetta was great, but when it came to the calamari - it blew our minds! So delicious it was ridiculous. Then we ordered dinner...paparedelle noodles (you really can't find them anywhere) with bolognese. Delicious. But lets get back to the calamari. I can't stop thinking about it to this day. You will not be disappointed I promise you!"}
{"text":"Lovely place for a date or dining w friends, especially the lounge seating; or I love the patio seating. Fine wines, but the orange blossom martini is too hard to pass up. Delicious mussels if you like lots of garlic and the pizzas are tasty!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, nice take on the wine bar/gastropub concept.  The food is very good and the service is good.  Cool atmosphere.  Great place for drinks and apps.  The bruschettas are really good and fun to share."}
{"text":"Good food. Had to think for a while with all the different tastes I was dreaming of from the menu. Ended up with the Italian sandwich. Others had pizzas and the rest, salads. All were in agreement that the food was great. We sat outside as it was a beautiful day."}
{"text":"This is our absolute go-to place within drop-by distance-we've been here probably a dozen times over the past year and we've never had a negative experience.   Favorite meal:    The Mediterranean Platter (olives, hummus, babaganoush, breadsticks, feta cheese, etc.) and an order of Bruschetta (you choose 4 out of 10/they're all good)...a glass of wine and a limoncella...absolutely marvelous and the perfect meal to share.   Only cons:  one of the only places in the area where you need a reservation-and the music is loud; solution to those is to go early and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Upsides: Great ambience and good wine selection for decent prices.  -Happy hour is seven days a week.  -The bruschetta apps were very good.   Downside: the chicken dinners were just ok . It was described as a breast but had a bone and leg attached. It was bloody near that area, so obviously not fully cooked. Hope I don't get salmonella!   If I don't get sick, I'll come back for drinks and apps only."}
{"text":"A cozy wine bar serving a variety of small plates, pizza and bruschetta.  We popped in early on a Friday night and were pleased to take advantage of happy hour-$5 off wines by the glass -even the pricey ones like Barolo-and a number of special happy hour bites like ricotta & honey bruschetta, meatballs and fried ravioli.  We got there early as they don't take reservations (except for large groups) and we were taking in a concert nearby.  They have a decent wine selection by the glass although they are in the process of changing over some of the wines so there were a lot of cross outs.  Food was good, but not that special.  The ricotta with honey would have benefited in my opinion from heartier artisanal bread while the marinara for the fried ravioli could have had a touch more flavor.  The place certainly is popular and service was very good.  Just wish the food had a little more pizzazz.  The cheese tray we ordered had the same toasted bread (meh), plain Jane water crackers and three so-so cheeses-a-missed opportunity.  I enjoyed the selection and quality of the wine but that alone wouldn't be enough to put this on the list on my next visit to the area."}
{"text":"An entirely over-priced and pedestrian menu, inept management and lackluster service combined with a very noisy environment, four (4) ounce wine pours, a pompous and unfriendly jerk trying to pass as a sommelier and unacceptably long drink times all add up to a place to be avoided at all cost.   Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Todd was our waiter and definitively stood out above any aspect of our dining experience. Knowledgable, warm, friendly and quick to recommend from his vast knowledge of Boccas menu.   Garlic fries were the big deal meal treat of the night. Crispy outside and soft, non oily core. Very good  flavor, a bit robust but I like my garlic strong.   Pizza was pretty good, a little thick on the bread but overall pizza size was perfect to split with another fellow pizza lover   Overall a fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"Todd our server was very attentive.   We had a couple of glasses of wine on happy hour, and ordered some bruschetta which was delicious and a personal Margarita pizza also delicious!  I would love to see this place when it's busy,  it has a nice atmosphere.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Bar = A+ Atmosphere/Ambiance = A+ Food = B+ Menu = B+ Service = A+ Ownership = A+ Overall Experience = A+  Two things that stood out to me...  The owner came up to our table and said \"thank you so much for coming tonight.\"  Then the waiter said \"we appreciate your business.\"  Just a great restaurant that does all of the little things to make you feel valued."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The Mediterranean appetizer was phenomenal... I would eat that alone without an actual dinner plate because it was so large"}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for date night.  My boyfriend and I go often, and we always start with the bruschetta plank.  My favorite entree is the smoked prosciutto alfredo.  The service  at the table is always flawless.  There's a certain hostess that always seems a little confused/distressed when telling us the wait time and/or seating us, but she's always very polite.  As for kids, my boyfriend's son says the pizza here is his favorite in town!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6, requested back wall tables.Had a great area for 3 college roommates to catch up!- Our waiter was patient with our decisions and quick to get the wine out to us! We had meatball, brie & meats appetizers , 3 pizzas and a pasta. All wonderful dishes,tasty wines .It was a great evening, thanks la bocca!!- We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderful service! Love this place. Will return often. Had 3 apps all were so great. Ordered the Bocca trio with basil hold the olives. It was even better."}
{"text":"came here on a date night with my wife. Great place and atmosphere for that. It was a little cold when we went(spring), but they have heaters on the patio. Hopefully they have misters too for now. We sat a high top, which is fine, it was a communale high top, so if you want your privacy make sure to request a regular table not a high top. The bruschetta was good, but skimpy, we were expecting something like postino's bruschetta board. Don't get me wrong it was delicious, just not the quantity we expected. We ended up getting two pizzas as well. I got the spicy pizza they had on their menu. I don't remember the name, but it was soo good. They had thinly sliced (vertically sliced) peppers on it which gave it a good heat. Not overwhelming at all (but so you know I LOVE spicy food, so if you don't you probably wont like the pizza).  I don't remember what my wife's pizza was because we both agreed mine was SOO good."}
{"text":"After a long day working the Convention Center, I needed a drink. Seriously. Thankfully, La Bocca's Orange Blossom Martini did the trick! It was quite fruity without being too sweet.  Oh, and I ate there, too. I tried a calzone with sundried tomatoes. Yum! The crust was just right (a little crisp outside, pillowy soft inside), and the filling inside (ricotta & those ruby savory jewels) definitely satisfied.   The rest of the crew gnoshed on apps, and were happy with the cheese plate, antipasti plate, and garlic fries.   For being so deep in the burbs, La Bocca is a cool little hideaway in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"A fun place that serves excellent food and wines - salads, pizza or sandwiches - all are wonderful - fun place for happy hour or lunch or dinner -"}
{"text":"La Bocca is my spot for lunch when I am needing a salmon salad (wish is a struggle since it's a daily crave) or a good girl chat for happy hour. Their lunch menu is spot on... The salads are wonderful and the sandwiches are top notch and service is always friendly and efficient.  They have a decent wine list but I am a huge fan of their cocktails, I personally thing they make one of the best Manhattans in town. They recently added some food to their happy hour specials (yippee!) and I am a huge fan of the ravioli."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here for a group dinner. The atmosphere is dark dim lighting in a cozy evening setting. The menu is Mediterranean with a focus on wood fired pizzas. Starting off we went with the Mediterranean plate, charcuterie plate and Antipasti plate. All were uniquely different and equally delicious. My favourite were the Med and Antipasti. Especially memorable was the roasted garlic. Many people avoid this but it's rich and buttery with only a very mild garlic flavour. Plus it sends off vampires in the evening so eat lots!   For my pizza I had selected the spicy pepperoni and I asked for extra Serrano chilies. They mixed up the pizza and gave it later to so,done else in my group so I only had the regular amount of serranos. Overall the pizza was good but nothing blow my mind wow. To wash it down we ordered a few bottles of the William Hill estate Bench - Cab Sav. We also had a few bottles of a Super Tuscan that the name escapes me but it wasn't memorable. The WH Cab Sav was quite a nice compliment to the pizza and the apps. Overall service was a tad slow but okay as it allowed for our conversation. All in all a great evening."}
{"text":"Their babaganuoush (sp)is great. so are their martinis!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, entire bottom of the pizza is burnt, don't have time to go back to have them fix."}
{"text":"Love this place- atmosphere is great, staff is friendly, food selection is awesome and drink list is on point"}
{"text":"My date and I were in desperate need of a drink on a Friday night after watching a choir of tiny little children attempt to sing Christmas tunes.  They only had one table available with no wait out on the patio. It was cold, but we were near a heater and were wearing our jackets, so it wasn't so bad. Although inside would have been more comfortable, I preferred being outside because we could actually hear each other speak. They need some sort of noise cancelling insulation in that loud room.   Sangria was fine. Nothing special. The bruschetta left something to be desired. The brie cheese with fresh orange marmalade was very uneven in terms of flavor balance. The sopressata was great! Just enough horseradish flavor to have a kick. Gorgonzola with pear, basil, and balsamic reduction was alright. And the smoked prosciutto with fig was probably my favorite.   For the actual meal, I wanted to split a calzone, but I wasn't paying so grilled salmon was the final decision. My date was happy with how crispy it was, but I thought the whole thing was pretty bland. And I was a bit disappointed that our salad didn't come with garlic bread. Ah well.   By the time we'd finished eating, the patio had cleared out and they closed the big window'd garage door from the inside, which left us with much more quiet to chat. At some point though, I realized our server never returned. So by the time she showed up, we already decided to hit up somewhere else for our after dinner drink.   It wasn't the worst. It wasn't the best. But as long as my mom liked it, I guess that's what matters."}
{"text":"Went out last night and had some really good pizza, the high light of the night was the skillet brownie topped with ice cream.....to die for amazing! Happy hour wine bear selections great atmosphere, must try at least once."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious here. We ordered the Margarita and the Bocca Trio pizzas.   The Bocca trio had a well rounded flavor to it. The Sicilian sausage tasted great and in my opinion, created the natural flavor for the pizza.   The Margarita pizza had a sweet sauce with the mozzarella cheese melted on top that made for a delightful flavor combination.   Overall the pizza was thin, with a thick crust which is what I enjoyed most about the pizza. The dough didn't overpower the ingredients on the pizza.   Great ambience and well decorated. This will be a place I definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Pizza has a great crust. We each had a salad that comes with rustic bread with a Rosemary butter. Our server, Todd, was spot on. We are visiting from Cape Cod and this Pizza rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food very good with normal European portions which allow you room to enjoy desert. I had the pasta with mussels, house salad and cookie and ice cream. Wonderful. I will definitely go again and try their happy house, they have a nice patio area I can see myself enjoying the great wine menu and appetizers. They also have a live band on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Very sleek & chic ambiance. Made me feel like we were in a real metropolitan city like SFO. The pizza is delicious & a great wine selection.  The brussetta could be better, but still good.  A most visit when up this way if the valley.  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving a 5 star because it was great, and it looks like there are a lot of reviews on this place under old management.  Went there yesterday with my husband for lunch.  Had a Mediterranean plate and Bruschetta planks.  EXTREMELY good! We sat at the bar.  Great ambiance,  service and food.  The bartender was nice, and another gentleman helped us as well ( I think the manager).   I highly recommend the Mediterranean plate, it's out of this World.  Yelp needs to take down the old reviews because obviously... this isn't the same place it used to be and it's not fair for the new business to take on the shortcomings of the old business.  YELP! Anyway, it was a great date and will be back."}
{"text":"So good. Get the roasted garlic pizza, sit outside, and enjoy a glass of wine. Nice decor and super friendly staff. We are from NYC and stopped here for dinner after a long work day and we're so happy we did!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time, but don't often make my way to Tempe anymore....and then I just recently discovered that there was a location in North Phoenix! I was so excited!  While I really wanted a pizza, I opted for a salad instead. I was boring and ordered the Chicken Caesar salad, but it was delicious! Paired with a glass of Tempranillo. Perfect.   I would like to come back to try the pizza...perhaps in a few months."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while on vacation, and I'm so glad we did. Walking in the front doors, we were greeted by a delicious subtle aroma of truffle and olive oil. Our server was prompt and super friendly. We ordered the antipasti dish and the Bocca Trio pizza. The antipasti dish has UH-mazing prosciutto wrapped goat cheese, the most delicious mustard, and divine bread, among other things. The pizza was super cheesy and full of flavor. Overall, a fantastic dinner. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pomegranate margarita and the caprese salad. Great atmosphere as well. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I love trying new places.. La Bocca is awesome! Great little pre game, happy hour or just date dinner place for dinner and drinks. I split the bruschetta and a salad with a friend. Just so good! I love the Scottsdale blonde beer they serve there too! Although the seating was a bit crammed, the service was phenomenal. Also beware there's only one restroom per gender. If you're looking for a cute spot for a beer, board, flatbread or salad, definitely give La Bocca a shot!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Michael, the bartender, was great when we went here to try some new whiskeys.  They even had some Pappy in the house."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at La Bocca. We have a 1 year old and the waitress really bent over backwards for us. She made sure my daughter had something to eat at all times! She was very fast! We both had salads and they were totally amazing! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"3 strikes up front.......atmosphere TOO loud,  cocktails without garnish (Manhattan no cherry, martini without olives) ,no iced water served as requested....but the food was good! signed confused."}
{"text":"From the moment you arrive the staff is like family.  Great experience and very inviting menu with a myriad of choices.  Excellent service and pristine presentation make the evening a 5* endeavor.  Brilliant use of the brick oven for perfect light char on any breads or crusts. All in all a wonderful ride for the pallet."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks  and service.  We sat at the bar and Aaron makes the best lemoncello martini.  Some unruly lady was behind us yelling about something about a tv station and the staff handeled the situation professonally."}
{"text":"Make happy hour here about once a month. They offer $5 off any glass of wine- I generally stick with the Underwood Pinot Noir, which is $5 after discount. They also offer discounted food, but it's not much better than regular pricing. Mostly $7 apps- meatballs, ravioli and others.. $3 for ala carte bruschetta. Recommend the Gorgonzola with basil and pear! My absolute favorite thing about this restaurant is that they actually serve their wine in the correct glassware that's appropriate to the type of wine you're drinking!!!! I love Pinot Noir glasses, and they get it right whereas most restaurants serve all wine in white wine or Cabernet glasses."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for the patio and the hostess put us inside. Said we were late but we were 15 minutes early. Waiter was never there for us. Spent more time at the computer on the bar, than with us. We've had him once before and had no complaints. Table in plain sight on the patio was empty while we ate, and waited inside for our computer wiz waiter.  This was not the experience we had on our 2 previous visits,they were much better. I'll average the 3 visits to 2 stars. We love the decor and the patio looks great....... from inside."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices! We were very impressed with the presentation, flavor, and over all atmosphere of this little hip eatery. It was great lounging on the couch and enjoying the meat and cheese plate with a decent selection of wines. Great Craft Dark brews as well! I highly recommend the vegetarian pesto pasta dish!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Pizza and mussels are my typical order and its always consistent. Good selection of wines too. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food and service is always on point!!!! Marc, Aaron & Ty are always so friendly. Sunday nights are quite the treat with half off bottles of wine. Great ambience, homemade pasta, wood fired pizza not to mention their sangria.....this place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food! Great service!  Have never been disappointed! Try anything on their menu! High quality food and drink at a very reasonable price.   Only down side is... I think they put nicotine in their pesto stuffed chicken entree, I'm hooked!  Overall great experience!  6stars!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was delicious! Atmosphere was also great. The service could have been faster but when you have some good wine, who really cares?  I'll be back"}
{"text":"La Bocca is a great boutique find! Unique location at High Street...love that it's small and warm. The happy hour cocktails are fantastically priced.  The food is mouth-watering.  A new favorite!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bruschetta plate only.  Sadly, wasn't a big fan. It wasn't as tasty as they looked and the bread wasn't just meh... And was on the thin side. Was slightly disappointed because last time I saw my friends get it, the plates looked so yummy and hearty. Oh well, I will stick to the fries... If we ever go back.  Service was good. Drinks were good.  One thing though... That has nothing to do with the food or drinks of la bocca but I need to caution my fellow Yelpers.  Some careless lady spilled a whole glass of wine on my husband and drenched his sports coat, white dress shirt and chinos at the bar. It was horrible. What's worse was that instead of being apologetic, she defended herself saying \"it was honestly a mistake\". And turned her back on us.    We left after settling our bill because honestly, I didn't want to be near that lady. I do think that people need to own up to their mistakes and she should've at least offered to pay for the dry cleaning bill. Such lack of class... Anyways, getting off my soapbox, I just wanted to caution you all to be extra careful when drinking wine and be cautious of your surroundings :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to La Bocca for the first time this week with a few friends and, despite my reservations about a \"Wine Bar\", it was a pretty decent experience.   Smack dab in the middle of CityNorth, this place definitely stands out as you make your way down the sidewalks. The decor is nice, earthy and rustic looking and has that upscale vibe, while still appearing inviting and cozy. The place is small, and was packed at lunch time, so keep that in mind and go early or be prepared for a wait. Oddly enough, the bar was deserted, so if you're flying solo, that might be a better option than trying to get a table.   Service seemed to be good at the outset and our group was seated in short order, but it seemed to waver a bit once we got our drink orders in. Took more time than I thought it should to get our beverages to the table, and and to get our orders taken. Granted, the place was packed, but it's a very small place and they had adequate staff, so there's still no reason to be that jammed up. There didn't really seem to be an improvement as the lunch wore on, and the fact that they plopped a screeching baby down next to us really didn't help either. Remind me again, am I at an urban wine bar for a business lunch or am I visiting a daycare center?   In terms of the food, we started with the calamari appetizer, which was fantastic. The flavor was excellent and it was perfectly cooked. The dipping sauce it came with was citrus flavored and, while I thought it would be a strange pairing, it turned out to be delicious and everyone enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the portion was so small that it  left us hungry and wanting more. For the price, I think they should up the portion size a tad, as it really wasn't enough for even one hungry person, let alone more.    For the main course, we sampled several of the pizzas and a couple of their \"planks\", all of which was good. I say good, but not necessarily great. For example, I tried the margarita pizza and, while the crust was good and the pizza spot on as far as how much it was cooked, the flavor wasn't terribly pronounced. I'm all for subtlety when called for, but most of what I tasted was the sauce, and there was nothing spectacular about it. I'm not looking to be overwhelmed or anything, but you should be able to tell you're eating a gourmet pizza by how it tastes, not just the fancy preparation and the fact that it's delivered to the table on a wooden, pizza peel-looking tray. What's the expression, all smoke, no fire? That probably sums it up.   Given the ambiance and decor, the proximity to the office and the price point, I'd probably go back, but with properly calibrated expectations. Among them, having to order an appetizer all to myself, not expecting too much from the pizza and expecting to be there a long time due to the slow service. As I said, it was good, not great, and there's nothing wrong with that if you're looking for the former and not expecting the latter."}
{"text":"Are you having as hard a time as me keeping all these wine bars' Italian names straight?  Maybe it's just my American ignorance.....anyway, LA BOCCA is probably the best one I've been to, and for sure the best restaurant in City North/High Street.   The decor is upscale, modern yet warm and comfortable.  They have a very nice patio with table and some low upholstered seating.  Great wine by the glass list with some special ones in the mix along with well priced names.  The wine came in Reidel glasses.  I loved the salads on the menu.  More than the caesar and caprese you usually see.  I ordered the pear salad that came with mixed baby greens, dried cranberries, walnuts and tomatoes.  The pears were a little dried and curled on the edges like they weren't sliced to order, but overall it was an excellent salad. I also had a slice of the brussels sprouts pizza, which came on a perfectly toasty chewy crust and had shaved brussels sprouts with crispy toasty edges, cheese and tasty garlic.  The bruschetta is the best of any wine-bar-ending-in-a-vowel; well toasted, well loaded with toppings. The sandwiches and calzones, the calzones about the size of a loaf of bread, looked really good, too.  Service was good but slow, so I don't recommend La Bocca for a quick lunch.  Who wants to rush through a nice lunch with wine, though?"}
{"text":"What a great night at La Bocca tonight. The atmosphere is energetic without being too loud. The server was quick to come and see us asking for our drink orders. They had some new seasonal cocktails that I needed to e to figure out so I wouldn't get the same Old Fashioned that I always get.   If you get the opportunity to come here for dinner, do not pass up the Mediterranean Plate as an appetizer. It is huge and very tasty.   My seasonal cocktail was fantastic. It was similar to an old fashioned, but with a little different flavor. They are not skimpy on the Bourbon which made the drink all the more better.   For dinner, I had the smoked prosciutto alfredo. Very good entree even though I was nearing fill from the app.    Oh... and I did also order an Old Fashioned that they do with a twist... cinnamon. Who can go wrong with that? It was fantastic. The entire night was fantastic. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the French Dip with the Horseradish sauce on the side.  They brought me a vinegar dressing instead.  I asked for the Horseradish and after a long delay, they brought me Thousand Island dressing with some onions mixed in.  Never got the Horseradish but they charged me $.50 to get it on the side.  I figured they could have that as the tip."}
{"text":"The handsome devil behind the bar, Tony, was not only very attentive, but also very engaged with my date and me. His extensive knowledge about the craft cocktails, wine, and food astounded us. This dashing man made the experience worthwhile and exceptionally enjoyable. We will definitely be back, but only if Tony offers one of his VIP shows. Thanks a lot big T and we look forward to seeing you again."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience- Wine: Cocktail  bar crossed with Italian fare. Lovely ambience - it was Crowded for a Thursday night  The charcuterie plate was sumptuous.  Loved the cocktails and wine. The pasta  was divine. Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"The food was great but the patio was a bit crowded and the country music from the bar across the street made it difficult to hear anything else."}
{"text":"Really nice small quaint place love the outdoor patio. Stellar service along with great food and wine. We enjoyed be bruschetta platter and a really good lemon chello"}
{"text":"Food is terrible but it's a good place to have a drink.  I went for \"happy hour\" on a Friday and apparently there isn't one. There are no food specials but they did have drink specials they will only tell you about if you ask. Why is it a big secret? I know they had $5 off glasses of wine, no clue on other drink specials because that's all I was told. Again, secret.  The wine was good and it's a smaller, cozy place. They had a list of Cabernets that range from $10-$37 a glass so there's definitely a selection.  Ordered the bruschetta - all 4 choices were nasty. I knew a stomach ache would be coming for sure. Truffle fries are also pretty gross. Really heavy and trying too much to put a lot of flavor into their foods.  If you want good bruschetta just go to Postino's. But if you just want a good glass of wine (they also had a HUGE list of whiskeys) I would recommend popping into the bar to check out."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you always come back to regardless of how you're feeling.  In fact, you may start your day somewhere else and say \"let's grab a Negroni over at la bocca my brother\"... And then my brother says \"ummm duh, does a bear poop in the woods?, does a priest love little boys? Does the average American owe more on student loans than what I owe on my car payment?\"... Hells yeah let's go to la bocca!!! Come one come all.  It's chill mixed in with great service and non pretentious bartenders who want to see you good and drunk just like I want!!! I'm looking to my right and there's a woman with a cardinals hat yelling at the tv.  I'm looking to my left and there's a guy drinking a dirty martini.  It's that kind of place.  By the by, the food is top fu**%ing notch brothers and sisters.  I just had a mini orgasm in my mouth.  Don't judge me"}
{"text":"Really great pizza and appetizers. We were there for happy hour, they have a nice happy hour with discounts.  The prices are on the high side. We had the assorted bruschetta which was good, fresh soft bread with great assortment of cheeses. Also had the boca fries with dipping sauces. We had the roasted garlic and bocca pizzas with lots of really delicious fresh assorted meats which were made with fresh ingredients  and tasted delicious. The service was great and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent Spirits, bartender TJ was phenomenal. Introduced me to a new rye called WhistlePig, outstanding. I highly recommend this place if you're close to the area. The sights aren't bad either. Not a college make up a shot place. If you enjoy a nice cocktail it's the place"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...a little loud but kind of expected. This place is located on High Street... Super cute area! We had a bruschetta plank, Chicken Alfredo pizza, Caesar salad & creme brulee....all of it absolutely delicious. Hubby says bathroom was a wreck but otherwise a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely Italian restaurant, nice decor and lots of great dishes cooked well with great taste! I would recommend this restaurant to any one looking for a nice Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"A lovely wine bar and great addition to City North.  Ambience was very nice, great happy hour pricing on wine and delicious fettuccini.  Lots of interesting items on the menu.   Friendly bar staff  - highly impressed.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went there with friends.  The food was outstanding. I'm gluten free so I had a salad with Salmon Of which was really good.  My husband and friends had pizza and they loved it.  We did the special which was a pizza and bottle of wine for $20.  The wine was ok but the atmosphere was great.  Our service was outstanding. We will go back."}
{"text":"Great place for solid food! Fresh taste and the beer salad was great. Server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Poor reservation experience. Booked using online option. La Bocca website does not include any detailed reservation requirements. By chance called to up party size and given run around that fixed menu required with \"banquet planning\" needed for a party over 14. Manager kept repeating one check requirement and stressing out. When I asked for \"banquet services\" and a superior Manager gave me an email address. I asked for phone number and she said there wasn't one. Good thing there is one on their Mill Avenue Management page. Not worth the effort to inconvenience this place by asking to eat at their establishment!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed after seeing so many good reviews and 4 star overall rating.  We ordered the mussels and calamari for an appetizer, which was extremely unfortunate since both were worse than the Sam's Club frozen food section.  Next we tried the bruchetta appetizer with multiple selections.  This could have been tasty, but the bread wasn't even toasted and literally felt like eating it directly from the butternut bag.  Our main dishes were pretty substandard as well.  I had the pasta Bolognese which was comparable to a mediocre hamburger helper.  The pizza was borderline unedible with awful Ragu sauce and soggy bread.  The only decent thing was a beet salad, which is tough to screw up.    We didn't even bother to stick around for desert since nothing was worth eating.  The only reason they get 2 stars is excellent service, which is tough to find in the valley."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this hidden gem while looking for something to eat, great atmosphere, the service was awesome (ask for Maya... She was amazing! She suggested great wine, was very attentive and knowledgeable!) We each ordered a pizza, the garlic pizza and the La boca trio and both were DELICIOUS! The brownie pizookie was so good! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I sat at an empty bar for 10 minutes while the bartender chatted with her manager and friends. Can not recommend."}
{"text":"We came here after work because it was located within less than 2 miles of our hotel (Marriott by mayo clinic). They had happy hour specials, $2 off draft beers and $5 wines on certain wines. We were seated outside and it was pretty nice out.   We got some apps to share with the table among 7-8 people. We got the Mediterranean plate- I highly recommend it. It is probably enough to share with 5-6 people- the bread and cheese  was amazing. We also got bruschetta to share- I liked the one with pesto and salami. The cheese ones were great too!  You get to pick four different kinds for $12. For my entree I got the chicken pesto pizza and it was a mini pie for about $16.I was super full after eating this. Theygave a decent amount of chicken!!   I really enjoyed the food here and would def come back. It's located in a mini shopping center type thing."}
{"text":"The truffled mushroom pizza (with added prosciutto) is hands-down the yummiest pizza I've had in a long time!!! Also the happy hour is great and there is a decent wine selection. As for the service, every time it has been on point and I enjoy the ambience. It's on High Street too which is an added bonus. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food selection and cut space.  Nice patio when the wether is cooler.  I had the orange drop and shared a selection of  bruschetta. Everything was very good."}
{"text":"Small plates & Wine close to perfection!  Not kid friendly & loud but what the heck what do you expect on a Fri night at City North!  Look forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"I very rarely write reviews but felt compelled to write one about La Bocca. My wife and I went on a Monday night with our six-week old son. Maya, our server, couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating with our little one. The happy hour specials were exceptional (meatballs and a wide variety of bruschetta), followed by an amazing Med Plate with great wine. The atmosphere was lively and fun but not overbearing. We enjoyed it so much  we returned on Thursday night where we had an identical experience with Todd as our server. I can't recommend this place highly enough - it has the perfect blend of great food, great service and great atmosphere. Next time we make it back to the area, we'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"We frequent this place quite often! They have a great Happy Hour and a really nice menu.  It's definitely one of the nicer places in our neighborhood. It's a little pricey if you are not there at Happy Hour time but I would definitely recommend stopping in and checking it out. It's got a great ambiance and really good people watching. Looking forward to stopping in again next week!"}
{"text":"Great spot and good atmosphere. Sat at the bar and Michael took great care of us. The grilled Chicken was really tasty but the cast iron cookie was AWESOME. I would recommend vanilla ice cream on top. I did chocolate but it was too much. Most important they had Pappy Van Winkle which is something I have wanted to try for years now! Great spot recommend!"}
{"text":"Fun, attractive spot to chat and have fun. Inside can tend to get very noisy so I don't recommend This for a quiet evening. Nice patio.   We ordered the Bruscetta planks, Med plate, and a pizza. Everything was cooked properly, seasoned well.    Wine, beer and Sangria were ordered by our group of 9 girls. White Sangria is a little sweet but not horrible. Certainly refreshing. Others enjoyed the Red Sangria.   Would recommend and will come here again. Staff was very friendly.   Strangely, parking was horrible for a Wednesday at 6:30pm in early June. Definitely Uber yourself over there and give it a try."}
{"text":"Perfect for date night, I had a 50 dollar gift card so I brought my boyfriend here at about dinner time and I'm so glad I did!  The ambience is beautiul, I love high street and it's definitely becoming more upscale. The parking wasn't difficult for us and it was free! (definitely an upside to this location over the mill ave one).  We chose to sit outside since it was so nice out... Our server greeted us promptly and gave us the wine list which is actually HUGE. (Definitely IS a wine bar).  Based on how upscale this place FEELS, I was surprised by how good the prices were. I would definitely check this place out for happy hour if you get a chance.  My boyfriend and decided we were going to split all of our dishes and the servers didn't make a fuss about it. Everything was presented beautifully (see pictures) and tasted great! I would HIGHLY recommend the bruschetta flights! Such great flavor combinations.  Out of all the pizzas, my favorite was the garlic pizza with green tomatoes.....I DIE. I could eat it for the rest of my life. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Not my first time, but maybe my last.  Intentionally waited for an outdoor seat and decided to have a drink at he bar.  Took a good 10-15 min for bartender to even acknowledge us and then when she finally put in my drink order at 6:32, she didn't even make it a happy hour drink.  Then after waiting 30+ min for a table the hostess let a group of impatient women jump into our requested outside booth.  Instead of correcting the situation and confronting the women, he had us wait for a table.  Was not happy and provided the feedback. On top of that, the salad was average and the garlic pizza was bland/raw. Glad to see it was busy, as we need some consistency in neighborhood, but hoping we just had a one off night.  Will update if we do go back (for better or worse!). All in, bad experience with average food....too much competition to rush back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, location, and setting. Food was ok, service was light with too few staff.  Feel like for the location and competition they will have to step up their game to compete. Wasn't bad just wasn't great. Was there on Sunday at dinner time."}
{"text":"My friend & I ordered grilled salmon with rice. When they brought our dishes, the salmon was so small than they accepted to charge us only half. Also instead of rice, they served the salmon with orzo (small pasta type that looks like rice). SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?  My other (third) friend asked for grilled chicken, guess what??? They brought just a peace of leg!!!!!!!  WTF with that?!?!!!? they charged $19 per dish!!! Seriously AGAIN?!???!?! It's valid to mention that the waiter gave us an excellent service!"}
{"text":"Sorry Norm, This Place is Better than Cheers   Phoenix is too big a place for a bartender to remember your name, right?  Not only did Aaron remember our names but what we like to drink too!  Top shelf service, good prices, delicious brick oven pizza & pasta, plenty of inside, bar and patio seating and a convenient North Phoenix location.  Excellent choice for a semi-casual dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"La Bocca seems kind of hidden way in Desert Ridge, across from the main mall area. Similar to other wine bars in the area (Postino's at Kierland), they serve bruschetta, sandwiches, salads and pizza. For lunch, we tried the beet salad, chicken salad sandwich, and a board of four bruschettas. I really liked the sandwich, which is made from bread using the same dough as the pizza, but I thought it was a little small. The chicken salad was nice though, since it didn't have Mayo. The bruschettas were really good - my favorite was the blue cheese pear. We also tried the red and white sangrias which were both on the boozey side and not too sweet. Overall we had a nice light lunch here and our server, who was also from Oregon, was very friendly and fun to talk to. La Bocca is a good choice if you're already in the Desert Ridge Mall area or staying at the nearby JW Marriott - it's a nice short walk away."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch.  Pizza is good but they can expand their beer selection.  Looking forward to going back during happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place. It appears small, but actually goes quite a ways back. They have nice patio seating and group seating as well in front of a big flat screen tv. They have a great selection of wonderful, lesser-known wines and Sunday evenings they offer half price bottles!"}
{"text":"My friend/coworker and I have been here several times after work on a Friday to unwind and kick back with a few drinks and good food. The last time we went here the server totally ignored us and totally knew we were sitting there waiting for him to take our order. What's worse is he walked by three times to take a drink order for the table next to us that arrived after us, to bring them their drinks, and then to bring them some plates. Each time he looked over at us. Finally we got up and left and went over to modern margarita because of the awful service. We had this waiter one time before and he was terrible. I won't be back to this La Bocca location due to this. It's sad because I love their hummus."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. We keep going back but it just doesn't happen. 4 oz wine pours are a rip off and prices are excruciating high. Food is not consistent and staff seems like not enough going on for them. Oh well I guess we will go there when we have nothing else to do. Good luck LeBocca"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Get the bruschetta plate- the ricotta option is awesome! One of my favorite places to hang with my girl friends or meet a date!"}
{"text":"We wanted to check out a new spot outside of the resort. Very pleased with our choice.  I asked for veggie sticks to substitute the bread for the Med Plate. Our waiter said yes without any hesitation. The plate turned out to be beautifully plated, and delicious!   The heirloom tomato and beet salad was very fresh. Loved it!  Their pizza was great, nice crispy crust.  The caprese dish fell flat. We didn't expect any onions to be there. The cheese felt a little dry. Maybe the other dished outshined this one too much.   Overall definitely a great spot for couples and groups of friends."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a glass of wine and appetizer.   We met some friends for dinner at la bocca last week. It was a great atmosphere with cozy decor. They offer $5 wine during happy hour, which was nice. We tried the bruschetta (you can select 4 different types), served on a plank, and they were yummy! The ricotta with honey was delicious and pesto with salami-mmm!  When it came time to order dinner, our group collectively decided there wasn't much to eat. We were told their pizzas were good, but that wasn't the route we wanted to take.  We got our (expensive) check and went somewhere else for dinner.   Cool place for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with friends on a weekend night! Live music, great food and atmosphere. Plus, easy access to a night club across the street. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!!  and the Bartender Aaron is cool as can be.  Even have my own drink Alex + Absinthe =  Alexsinthe  (1/3 Lemon, 1/3 Lime, 1/3 Absinthe and a splash of Fizzy Bubbly).  La Bocca is the official Gratto of North Scottsdale... what happens there... stays there ;-)  Club #408 just down the way."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  The first time the food was not up to par but the other times it was decent.  Nothing special though, and it is your typical trendy place that caters to the expected millennial crowd.  Service is OK but never been impressed or disappointed."}
{"text":"The bruschetta came out on soft bread.  Once it finally came out.  After that we had to wait over an hour for two pizzas.  Once they came, one of them was the incorrect pizza.  The pizza was great, just poor experience."}
