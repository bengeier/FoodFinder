{"text":"This restaurant just opened three days ago and replaces El Gitano, a spanish restaurant that specialized in paella. Mango's menu is still under development: it offers at the moment shish taouk, different kinds of salads and a nice selection of sandwiches. They also have pastries (croissants, pain au chocolat, etc.), coffee (Caf√© Brossard) and tea (Four O'Clock).

The main attraction is the pricing, which is very affordable. A large coffe only costs 1.95$! For less than 10$, you can get a generous portion of shish taouk with two side dishes (rice, roasted potatoes) AND two salads of your choice. We tried the food tonight, and spent about 18$ (including tips) for two large plates of food and a drink. The food itself is good, but could improve in many ways. The rice was not flavoured, and the potatoes were getting cold. The meat was very tender, but not really seasoned either. The couscous salad was a bit dry. The fruit salad had a good variety of fruits (pineapple, apple, strawberry, cantaloupe, watermelon), but some fruits were fresher than others.

Mango Bistro is mostly competitive because of its pricing, but otherwise does not distinguish itself from e.g. Basha or Amir. But hey, they just opened - I'm sure there's plenty of improvements that will come soon.  

Note: Props to the employee who was handling the business all by himself! The service was great."}
{"text":"This recent addition to the Parc/Milton collective of cafes and restaurants is one that I welcome. Options for food have been growing in this area but this is by far the best value for money. With $3.95 shawarmas, sandwiches, hot meals, soup of the day and coffee it's hard to beat the quality at this price point. 

The owner is also very conscious of the students in the region and has set it up with great wifi and welcomes you to sit and do your work here. I wish this had been around when I was a student. Regardless, right now I'm having a great time stopping by to read and have a coffee after work"}
{"text":"Mango Bistro is a hidden gem! 

The food is delicious, healthy, and super affordable. The owner is kind and offers great service. The place has a lot of seating and has fast wifi so you can also get a lot of work done. There's no loud music, so this makes for a perfect study spot with a large coffee costing only 1.85$.

You have to try their shish taouk! It's super simple and actually reminds me of the shawarmas I used to have in the middle east.

Definitely grab a bite to eat here, or hang out and get some work done for a couple hours!"}
{"text":"Really nice place for lunch. The food is cheap, fresh and delicious! Love their grill veggie sandwich! Why isn't it packed with people? If this place was closed down because no one goes there, McGill students don't deserve tasty and affordable food."}
{"text":"Super affordable and cute place. 
Sandwiches and salads are very tasty, and their coffee is pretty good. Place is always clean and the owner is super welcoming. 
I recommend trying their spinach pie."}
