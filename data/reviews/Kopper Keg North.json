{"text":"I can't describe how much I dislike this place. Why can't I describe it? Because I've never been allowed to eat/drink here thanks to the staff.

Twice I came in. Twice I waited for 15 minutes with not so much as a glance from the bartenders. Twice I got up and left without even seeing a menu. 

I can't believe that they allow this to happen at a place of business. I get you're a \"local\" place, but I'm a local. I live in your area. Why don't I deserve your business?

B-Dubs is on the other end of the parking lot, and their service is a lot better. Shucks is down Durango and their food is great and their service is better. Timbers, which I regard as a pretty low-star experience in the Centennial area, would still get the nod from me over this place for no other reason than they acknowledged my existence. 

Don't waste your time, and don't give them business. If zero stars was a thing, that's what they would get."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible, if you aren't the \"cool crowd \" you will be neglected"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Matt the overnight bartender only caters to his regulars. .. he is very unprofessional.  He almost started a big riot. Me and my friends are never coming back here. There's at least 4 bars that I passed before getting to this place. Go somewhere else if you want my advice, somewhere you're getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"In Vegas there's is very few bars that pour Guinness correctly! This is not one of them.. feeling annoyed.. What a disgrace to Guinness drinkers"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars. If we don't go there for the inexpensive but delicious wraps, chicken fingers, or nachos, then we're there just for a Guinness and the brownie sunday. There's a separate room seating area from the bar and the seating area in the bar area has cozy seating and a fire place. Definitely would recommend, haven't found anything bad there yet."}
{"text":"Have been there quite a few times before & the food has been pretty decent. Tonite, however, they really dropped the ball, food was terrible, order was wrong. Ordered 2 cheeseburgers and mild chicken fingers to go. Got home & was disappointed immediately that we got wings instead of fingers. I don't mind wings but the fianc√©e hates them. More importantly the burgers were horrible, the waitress had asked how we wanted them cooked, we ordered medium, they were very over cooked& obviously pre-cooked. Cold & dry, & we only live 3 blocks away! Could've went fast food route if we wanted dried out, cold burgers! Although conveniently located, will not get food there again."}
{"text":"Get it together ask for shot tequila she tells me she has to many liquid to say sorry fix it"}
{"text":"This place sucked ordered a pitcher of bud light  beer it had a white plastic in the middle to keep the beer cold but the beer was warm more like to give you less beer  2 1/2 glasses of beer to a pitcher really  we ordered the captains plater was told it had fish shrimp calimarri and fries she showed up with fish shrimp and hushpuppies and fries  I guess she didn't think we would notice 
Final total 70 bucks for 1 pitcher of beer  4glasses  of wine and one captains basket what a rip off"}
{"text":"Love the outback cafe great hidden place to eat in this overcrowded northwest area. There's no a lot of options on Durango and this place was a nice change of pace. We tried both breakfast and lunch both times the food was extremely tasty, served hot and delicious."}
{"text":"the black haired female bartender working today sucks!!! worse service ever. stay away!!"}
{"text":"For Centennial local haunts, this place is great!
Every bartender and server I've encountered is extremely friendly and provides exemplary service.
The drinks are good and cold, and the gaming is better than I expected.

A great, clean, friendly local bar that we can enjoy.  I'm happy when I visit, and I'll probably become a regular!"}
{"text":"OMG

The Ahi bites are amazing

The 100oz beer tower...

Cobb and Southwest chicken salads...fresh and crispy

Yuhuhuhuhummmy!"}
{"text":"Unreal hamburgers. Seriously unreal! The bartender sold me on the fact that they receive their beef daily and grind it themselves and hot damn were they right! I also had breakfast here and wings (different times of course) and they were very tasty. The wings were some of the best in Vegas. I know I've talked a lot about food and this is a bar but seriously the food sets it apart. The staff is friendly. Comped drinks while gambling are prompt and bar conversations fun. I'll come here again!"}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE. It deserves 0 stars! Worst service I have ever experienced. Waited 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence. I heard this place was 'click-y' but c'mon guys get it together! How can you expect to stay in business if you don't help your new and potentially loyal customers."}
{"text":"We stopped by because it's one of the last neighborhood places we haven't tried yet. I'm one week post-op for a tonsillectomy, but they were gems and made some cheesy, gravy fries for me & made sure it was spice-free. The husband got the kegger burger & says it's pretty good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The day time bartenders are great. The night time bartenders are a bunch of jerks. The food is good but a little high for what you pay. Also the beer prices are  high (4 dollars for a draft beer).  I don't think i'll be going back there."}
{"text":"5 stars for socializing! From the bar tenders to the chef\"jake\" jake fyi mix half your cheese sauce and half your homemade salsa and call it your Queso! U will sell more of that as an appetizer! Then alone! Love Costa Rica!"}
{"text":"Considering I hate 99% of all bars in Las Vegas the Kopper Keg is actually pretty damn cool. Friendly and knowledgeable bar staff, descent food and at a more than reasonable price.  I haven't had the pleasure of sampling a lot of their menu but what I have had I liked.  I ordered the five alarm burger which I was quite fond of. Just the right amount of heat. Top notch quality burger topped with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and all the fixens. While I was BSing with the bartender he informed me that they freshly ground their burger patties daily, nothings ever frozen. This is a serious thumbs up in my book, and believe me it shows.  So if you're ever in the far northwest corner of the Las Vegas valley and are jonesen for a top notch burger and a few cold ones, look no further the Kopper Keg is your destination."}
{"text":"So disgusted with the service! His name was Steve and he was less than interested in us and I'm a 13 year vet in the service industry ive been a bartender server busser......you name it!  everyone deserves better! When I'm at your bar pay attention to me!"}
{"text":"Kopper Keg has a nice menu of typical bar food and a nice enough bar area. There are also pool tables and areas off the bar to sit and drink with friends. They also have an enclosed food restaurant to eat your dinner without all the cigarette smoke. But if you want to gamble, you have to be in the bar.

The cigarette smoke is rather intense in the bar area. When I leave this bar, I smell like an ashtray. Not enjoyable at all. Other nearby bars seep to have better ventilation. Also, this bar REEKS when you walk in. Stale and musty, as if the carpets were filthy. This smell goes beyond simple cigarette odor.  Other bars in the area may have a cigarette smell, but do not reek like musty or moldy carpets. 

The bartenders are pretty cool, but sometimes it's difficult to get their attention as they will converse with a favorite client for a long time and not look around at the rest of the bar. 

Their french fries, both the waffle fries and the natural fries are yummy. Burgers are not that great. Fish and chips were good and would have been great if only they hadn't overcooked the fish so that the batter was almost burnt."}
{"text":"Good vibe here. We watch football game and had a few drinks.  The club sandwich (wrap I asked to have it made as a wrap) was big and tasty.  I did need to add some sauce, then it was perfect.  I liked the steak bites, they were a little chewy and pricey, but still pretty good.  The server (Brittney?) was awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"Out for a Saturday adventure and stopped in for a beverage and a bite. Delighted to say we had wonderful service, excellent food and we will be back again the next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at this hidden gem! Nice atmosphere, plenty of TVs for sports fans, and great selection all-round."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had ahi tuna boreal and steak tops. Also the chicken wings are crunchy and delish ordered the garlic parm.my Moscow mule was.perfectm excellent attentive service. Will come again"}
{"text":"I used to hang out at this bar but after I put a bad review on another site about a guy named Steve, who I think is still there, I was run out of the place by the staff.  They threatened me for writing a bad review and I haven't been back since.

You are all right about the \"clicky\" thing they have going on.  If you aren't a part of the bartenders drunk parties and drunk fests, you will not be liked.  Also, if you don't tip at least 10% of anything you win from the machines they will talk shit about you.

Stay away, they are very mean vindictive people!!!  The only time I got good service was when I drank a lot, tipped a lot and sucked up to the staff."}
{"text":"Living in the area there really aren't too many bars around. I've been there a few times.  Drinks are reasonably priced and the bar food WAS pretty good. Service has always been an issue. Either the 1 waitress ignores you or takes forever to bring you your drinks or food. Well last night was the last time I'll be visiting. Ignored again over and over. I had to go up to the bar several times to order. Afterwards we hung around trying to grab someone's attention just to get the check and leave. Went to the bar and the 2 bartenders were just hanging around. 1 saw me but didn't make any effort to see if I need help. Finally when the other bar tendered decided to turn around, I asked for the check he didn't seem helpful. The waitress finally came out and I asked for the check. Horrible. I'd rather drive a few more miles somewhere else to give my money and enjoy my drinks then this place. PS food was cold liked it been sitting around for a while and all seemed frozen for too long. What a shame."}
{"text":"Bad service.... the bartenders only want to serve the people that frequent the place on a regular basis. I went with my g/f for the first time a few weeks ago and had to walk around the bar to where the bartender was chatting with his buddies in able to order our drinks because he wasn't coming around. We decided to give the place a second chance and went again last week, thinking differnet night different bartender, but I received the same poor service, from another one of there bartenders."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, absolutely amazing bar tenders. This is a place where you quickly become family and call home."}
{"text":"I expected the crowd for the first NFL Sunday to be bigger. Once I go t to experience the service, I knew why. The server was indifferent and sarcastic, I think she thought it was charming. It was not. Then I learned that they were out of coffee creamer (flavored was available). While I realize that it is a bar, it is reasonable to assume that there will be coffee sales at 9:30 on a Sunday morning. No apology or acknowledgment that this is unusual, just just a shrug of the shoulders. The football menu included a special sandwich of the day. When I inquired what it was, I was told that specials are listed on the board by the front door. I was clearly high maintenance because I didn't read it before sitting down.
I ordered a quesadilla. When it arrived I asked for a glass of water. It arrived well after my meal was completed. In a city loaded with great sports bars, there is no need to settle for mediocrity. There will be one more empty chair at the Kopper Keg Deer Springs next week."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Love the pizza! Just know that they charge $1 per item when you order take out. It jacks up the bill quick."}
{"text":"Really great burgers and fries. the bartender is the best I've had since I moved here"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and while I didn't sit in the bar I did sit at a table off to the side. Both times the service has been great and the food is as a good as any bar food you would normally get, so no complaints! I was surprised that while I drank and ate food for a couple of hours I told the sever I wanted to place an order to go. I looked at my bill to pay and saw that I was charged $1 for a to go order, again not a big deal but asked the server if I would have asked for a box would I have been charged $1? She said no but since they had to box the food we charge you that. She did seem pretty annoyed that I asked her this, so clearly I'm not the first person to question it. Just seems very cheap to charge an additional amount while I have already been in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great bar,Great food and Great service.

Weekly pool tournaments, a sports lounge, a nice large bar and great bar menu. Very reasonably priced. Blue Moon on Tap.

Stop in have a cold one & a burger you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to watch the games especially because the b dubs down the street gets so crowded. Bar staff is slow if you are a guy from what I saw females got catered to fairly quick while I had to wait for a while but it's to be expected. Food was decent bar fare I had the pretzel bites and wings extra crispy my girl had the Mahi appetizer I mean not great but tasty I'd recommend either if you come in. I like the atmosphere pretty chill not to crazy and if you want to talk it's not to loud. Overall though an average bar spot that is a good option if you are close by I wouldn't make a long drive to attend this place by any means l. Dan is a nice guy he works behind the bar easy to talk to so if you get the chance give this place a go."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome,  but I don't know if there was a change in management or what. Now it takes forever to place an order,  the vibe is totally a let down, and the staff seems like they don't care. The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because the food is decent."}
{"text":"Used to come here pretty often, haven't been in awhile though. Went in last night to watch a game, bartender was initially pretty blunt and uninviting but she warmed up over time. Food is good, simple bar food, but tasty nonetheless. 
A random drunk guy came up and put his arm around me, and made my wife and I very uncomfortable (this was at 7pm on a Thursday by the way).  We mentioned it to the bartender, and she just waved it off saying that he's in there almost every night and he's the 'resident drunk'. She almost made us feel bad for mentioning it. He was definitely past the point where they should have continued to serve him. He came around again and was just annoying as can be. 
The server brought us our tab without us asking, and we still had over half a beer left each, felt like she was urging us out. I don't mind this place, despite the smoky air, but if he's a regular here, and is always that drunk, (and is being defended by the staff!),I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"It was around 3:40pm on this Tuesday evening with a 106 hot oven waiting outside, this place air conditioner was the right amount of cool. The blue moon was cold and the orange was fresh. Getting the Potato Skins were a good idea. They were crispy, light, and flavorful. The Onion Rings were just as good. Freshly made, hot, and tasty. Very chill, quite spot that has early 2000's playing. Nice co-workers but not too interactive with us new customers. 
Overall it was a okay experience."}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff was nice. The prices were alright. They have a decent amount of tvs, but not compared to other sports bars. I would watch football here again."}
{"text":"The bartenders and waitress only focus on the regulars. The service was not satisfactory. The food is good."}
{"text":"I went to this place despite some nasty reviews I read. What can I say, I'm a thrill seeker.

The complaints most people will tell you about this place isn't the food, but the service. I visited this place for the first time yesterday and have no qualms about either.

I didn't stay long, I sat at the bar and drank a Budweiser. They were out of XX which was a bummer. I ordered a small appetizer to ensure I wasn't sloshed for the drive home. I got the pretzel bites with cheese. The cheese was a little too on the olivey side, but the pretzels were delicious and smothered in artery clogging butter. Just the way I like it!

Hey, if you wanted to be healthy, your dumbass wouldn't be at a bar, now would it?

The bartender was very nice. Her name was Tara and she paid plenty attention to me. My food and drink came pretty quick, she stopped by every once in awhile to ensure I was okay, and I didn't have to wait to have my check to be brought to me. She seemed to make her rounds on everyone just the same, so I assume she's not the bartender people have been complaining about. Ans she's super nice to boot!

I went in the afternoon time, so it wasn't too packed, but there were quite a few people there, including obvious regulars. Lots of sports on the TV screens and they even have an entire non-smoking section for people that are afraid to die.

This was a first time visit and though it wasn't long, it deemed good to me and I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how it is always insanely smoke filled in this bar, but it is terrible even when no one is in there. Sadly, that's not the worst part of this place. Don't expect anyone to acknowledge you for a while, you'll sit there and be ignored. I've been told it's because the bartenders think they're better than the customers. I've never asked them their thoughts on that, but it is how they've treated me every time I've gone in there except once. So once out of about 10 times, not great odds. Needless to say, I haven't gone back, nor do my friends want to go there either."}
{"text":"Pretty basic local sports bar. Lots of seating, TV's everywhere, and a few beers on tap. No specialty drinks or special menu. Bubs and I came on Thanksgiving so it was almost empty. The bartender was very sweet. They had a promo where if you bought Samuel Addams winter lager you got a free glass to take home, so she poured my beer in a separate pint glass so I wouldn't have a sticky cup to transport home. Bubs is on a diet (boo) so she kept him well hydrated with water. They have two pool tables in the back and a nice fireplace to cozy up next to. The overall decor is a hunter's lodge/farm house feel complete with a high barn Esq ceiling making the bar feel very spacious. Yes, it does get quite smoky in there, but it kinda comes with the local sports bar territory. I have 100% been to worse places, plus the video poker is pretty loose (two 3 of a kinds, one 4 of a kind, and a full house off of a $20.)"}
{"text":"Love this place great hang out for the Centennial Hills area. This is definitely the place to be during football season. Danny the bartender is the best! And every time I'm there I can't stop eating their pretzel bites they are so amazing!"}
{"text":"It's funny how many bad reviews this place got, so when I had a chance to check it out I did, first thing I noticed was this place was packed.I had read reviews stating how can this place stay in business? It was even a week night. Finally found a seat at the bar and Dan the bartender greeted me. I asked about some different beers and he suggested one that I tried and very much enjoyed it. I then asked for a menu and got the chicken wings well done, they came out exactly how I ordered them. Maybe this place has gotten better or changed but I really enjoyed myself and will deffiantly return to the Keg. If Dan is there ask for him, he is amazing and very knowledgable on all the beers and food."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and was shown into a small long room with tables on one side and booths on the other. 
Our server gave us the menus which were small on items, but had enough to chose from. The meals were good for a breakfast.Altogether a nice place for a quiet breakfast, the staff were good and friendly.
A nice surprise!"}
{"text":"I have ate at this location several times but today was by far the worst in terms of customer service, food preparation and lack of management ethics.  The food servers at this location if you order to-go, will not give you your change and take it for themselves instead! I have witnessed this myself in person today.  The order I had today two out of the three items were correct however I was assured everything was correct by the server, prior to her stealing my change.  After I got all the way home and opened my mail which was their chicken sandwich with fries come to realize that chicken sandwich was mostly burnt and dry, as well as the bun and I got flipping sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries that I ordered.  Management did offer to comp the meal, although they would not comp me what I actually paid for it, because of their $2 service order, on all to go orders on top of the additional pricing,of they're ala-cart items like bacon and onions, which any other restaurant would include in that type of meal.  I used to really enjoy this location however the quality of staff has dropped off a cliff and the management doesn't seem to truly care about their patrons."}
{"text":"Cool location good beers but when I asked the waitress is the nachos had real cheese or the nacho cheese she said the cooks make the cheese from scratch.....yeah right straight up Costco cheap ass cheese. 

Total let down on nachos."}
{"text":"Went in for a late breakfast and a bloody Mary and let me tell you amazing service and food.
Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this bar more times than I can count. I love it. Here something you don't here too often with bars: The food is.Really good! I love the pretzels bites! I could eat those damn things every time I'm in there. Let's see, the BLT is awesome too. The chicken fingers are pretty tasty. If you order the nachos, be prepared to have an empty stomach or someone else to share your food with. 
Onto the prices: They are exactly where they should be. Not too pricey. 
My favorite two things about this bar..... the lighting (it's dimmed) and the gambling is awesome. I rarely leave this place down. I play Keno mostly. My hubby plays poker. It's one of our favorite places to play. The first time we played Keno at this bar, we left with over 1K in our pockets. It was a good night! Suzie is a really good bartender. Ask her for some Sooz juice. You won't regret it! There is plenty of seating. Lots of tables too. 
If you want to bring your family, there is a smoke free side. 
Last but not least, if you're trying to catch a game on TV, chances are it's on one of their many tv's. They've got plenty of them. There's also a couple pool tables. The bartenders are super laid back. Attentive too. Be sure tip your bartenders and servers!!!!!! They work their asses off. (:"}
