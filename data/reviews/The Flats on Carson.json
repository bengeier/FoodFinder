{"text":"Been visiting this place in and off for about a year. Good prices and a decent menu over the past 12 months. This month they changed their menu up and what s difference! I have tried 3 entrees off the new menu and each one is a winner! Bar staff is solid and nice. Atmosphere is casual but energetic as the night goes on. At times it feels like an old school house party, because everyone is into the groove. Highly recommended for the weekends. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Honestly I wish I could give 0 stars. They wouldn't let my friend in because he was \"too drunk\"  meanwhile he only had 3 beers. Absolutely ridiculous. I was a regular and honestly I don't think I'll be returning. I'm extremely unsatisfied with their bouncers/service."}
{"text":"Ghetto bar now ... Had a good thing going now literally it's a hood bar. Make sure you wear your bullet proof jacket before you go in there!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ARE COLORED. MOST RACIST bar I've ever been to in US. I was Visiting Pitts from Chicago and was at this bar around 11pm on Sunday, Sept 3, 2017. Was refused to purchase any drink by a Caucasian male bartender in his 40s just because I'm Asian(Chinese). He shouted at me and repeated twice as the following: \"get the f*** out of here\". Unbelievable first time experience in such a place of racists."}
{"text":"I read through many of the reviews before going to The Flats last night with my friends, and I feel the need to post this review because I did not find any of the one-star reviews to be accurate. Maybe it's because I'm a girl. Maybe it's because the rude bouncers weren't working. Regardless, I had a great time at The Flats, and I would definitely go again. No line on a Saturday at 11:00 PM. If there is a dress code, it most definitely wasn't being enforced last night. I saw people wearing sneakers, sweatpants, and t-shirts. There were many people of different races, so I'm going to have to disagree with the people saying the bouncers and owners are explicitly racist. I can't speak for the bar downstairs, but I received fast service at the bar upstairs. I could have used a little more pop music instead of mainly hip-hop for three hours, but it's more of a hip-hop than a pop place anyways, so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could the way you handle women is despicable you should be disgusted in the way that your bouncers aggressively grab women...$20 charge?! What is this Las Vegas?! and I have been here before I have been inside and is not worth that you guys are awful human beings you should be ashamed of yourselves as being owners because it's misogynist and down right disrespectful"}
{"text":"The Flats is one of the best bars I've ever been to. The bartenders are really awesome and they have a huge selection of beer and cocktails to choose from. The atmosphere is amazing. My bartender was Shana and she made me the best drinks and was so sweet, friendly, and patient. They have huge tvs to watch the games and they have an awesome DJ. If you haven't gone to this bar yet, please check it out. The prices are good and it's a really good time."}
{"text":"Great place to go in Southside! Great craft draft beer selection and strong drinks... flatbreads are tasty. DJ Nugget is one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to have fun and dance this is the place to go. The DJ was great, the staff and bar tenders were very helpful and friendly. It is very small on the inside so if you're the type of person who likes personal space this may not be the place for you. Also, getting to the bathrooms were a struggle because of the tight space as well as the steep steps. 

Overall its a fun place with good music and if you're lucky you may even get to see Wiz."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night, and the place was hopping. The DJ was fantastic never letting one song go for too long, but allowing you to get hype for the next song. Drinks were moderately priced; I paid $6.50 for a Strongbow Cider. I do need to find the name of this fantastic sparkling wine that they had. As it got later, more people flooded this two-story bar. The first floor is mostly for mingling with high-top tables and chairs. The second floor is for dancing. Both have a full bar. The bathroom is located down in the basement, and it was one of the cleanest that I've seen. There was an attendant that had everything you could possibly need--hairspray, lip balm, gum, etc. If she doesn't have it, then it's just time for you to go home."}
{"text":"Super creepy bunch of the drunkest people I've seen in a long time.  Extremely rude bouncer  and a cop that just doesn't care."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great spot for a drink and some delicious apps. We popped in after my brother's graduation to have something light. The pretzel bites were fantastic, the cheese sauce was rich and thick. Flat bread was great, crisp and a lot larger than we thought. Buffalo chicken dip was delicious, came with a variety of veggie and cracker sides.

We made sure to visit Flats since it was my brother's bar of choice when he attended school in Pittsburgh. Being from New York I wasn't local and reached out to the restaurant to purchase a t-shirt for my brother. Mark replied to me and hooked me up with a great shirt for my brother who was completely surprised and excited to have the shirt as a memory of his times there.

Overall, fantastic service and great food!"}
{"text":"Very nice bar/lounge in the southside! The bartenders are always friendly, and they have great drink specials, it's one of the least ratchet spots in ss. I enjoy myself everytime I go for a few drinks. Don't know if they have food if not they should"}
{"text":"Favorite bar in the SouthSide.  Such a mixed crowd of people, but everyone always seems to get along and have a good time.  Not your typical trashy college aged SS crew.  More people in their mid-late 20's and early 30's than other spots.  The same bartenders are always working and they are consistently friendly and quick.  Drinks are good and reasonably priced.  I prefer this place on a weeknight, Friday or Sunday.  Saturdays are ALWAYS packed here.  Being under new management was the best thing that has happened at this location and I think the guys who run it have a really good thing going for them.

Try their chicken quesadilla or one of their flatbreads. So good!"}
{"text":"Once inside, The Flats was a fun place with reasonably priced drinks. However, we waited an extremely long time outside- which would have been forgivable if there weren't so many people let in in front of us for no apparent reason. They didn't show any advanced purchase tickets or wristbands and didn't look like \"VIPs\" - just regular college students or 20 somethings. They also didn't appear to be paying cover. I assume the bouncers let a lot of friends inside- and all bouncers do, but the number of people that skipped the line brought it to a standstill. While the first floor was packed and it was hard to get a drink, the second floor was less crowded and more fun. It was a good night but we should
Have been able to spend more of it inside with drinks instead of outside in line."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews of this place before we accidentally stumbled upon it. We were looking for a party on a random Sunday since it was my birthday and when we saw the DJ in the window we decided to try it. At 4pm it was pretty busy and the DJ was good so we stayed for a few drinks. 

I'm not sure why the other reviews are so focused on this place being racially biased towards its patrons but my boyfriend is black and we had zero problems. The crowd was very mixed with different races and multiple people actually bought us drinks and were very friendly. 

As for the staff, 3/4 bartenders weren't even white themselves so I can't find a logical argument from that perspective either about all these so-called racist white people. Bouncers at the door were stone-faced but aren't all bouncers? We ended up leaving to eat and coming back until 11pm that night. 

For a Sunday, this place was lit. Don't focus on the negative reviews about race and horrible staff because everyone we encountered was just there to have fun. Don't be a drunk idiot and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great time in the south side, look no further. This is the premiere spot on Carson St. and if you're lucky, you might catch Wiz Khalifa there on a Saturday. Also killer Thursdays and Sundays for you dedicated SouthSide-goers."}
{"text":"Clean bar with a good selection of craft brews. 

I came here on a Monday, so not much was going on, I think it was only us and like 4/5 other people. Bartender was attentive and helped us quench our thirst quickly. 

Looked sleek and clean, it is a relatively small space. Music was good but not too loud or anything.   

Good place to catch up with friends on a Monday."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this bar or invite any of my friends here; the bouncer told me I was \"too ugly\" to get in.  I think that I am slightly attractive and the fact that I offered him $100 on NYE at 1AM  to let 2 girls in...and had he not been be a total asshole but he was. so sad that a place that was so talked up by friends  was ruined by a horrible experience by a bouncer."}
{"text":"Flats is fun sometimes. It's unique because they have an upstairs dance floor. I saw DJ Nutter butter once, it was aight. I most recently came here for a beer chugging competition, and the Miller lights were cheap. Not a bad spot if you want to dance and stay low key."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could this place is awful , racist and has leaky pipes and mold. Should be closed down and have the health department called."}
{"text":"We came here mainly because it didn't look overwhelmingly busy on a friday. Once we sat down we realized their happy hour runs 6-8pm so drinks were cheap as well as appetizers. We each ordered a buffalo chicken salad which turned out to be HUGE! It had grilled chicken on it instead of breaded like the menu said but that is fine by me personally. The bartender was friendly, helpful, attentive, everything you need from a bartender and not annoying in the slightest. We like this place. Seems like it must be a late night place most of the time since it was so empty but we got great food and great service. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Good spot to have a bite to eat, great bartender, female. Got my bevs asap with a friendly attitude. Nice price on the drink specials."}
{"text":"They dont let people in with ripped jeans.... its 2018. On top of this the place isn't great. When pete dj's is cool but otherwise just go to Marios"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday, no one else was here... 
I used the restroom and there was absolutely no soap to wash hands, I told the bartender and she said \" I don't even know if we have any\" . GROSS !!!! So they are making your drinks and then wash their hands in the cold water in the restroom? 
The bartender was super nice and friendly, she gets 4 stars. But I cannot get over the bathroom."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE FEATURES RACISM! Bartender refused to sell me and my friend (we are both Asian) drinks and told us to get the fuck out while he kept on serving other customers. We met another group of guys who had similar experience outside the bar. Please don't go to this place."}
