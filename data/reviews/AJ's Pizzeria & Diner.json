{"text":"Ordered a supreme pizza it was over done one of the worse I habe had in a longe time. I will rate it a one star."}
{"text":"Used to be Falbo's, now kind of tastes like a cheap knock off.  Not bad, better than the horrible big chain pizzas."}
{"text":"Stopped by late one night and picked up a pizza for takeout.  Although it seemed to be a little pricey, it was an excellent pizza.  Tasty thin crust, delicious pizza sauce and was very generously topped with mushroom (big fresh slices) and pepperoni.  So good."}
{"text":"Wow! All I can say is why didn't I know about this place sooner. AJ's offered a nice menu, prompt and courteous delivery with a steamy hot pie. And as a 'thin crust' loving family I will tell you the CRUST was a huge hit.   Why, you ask was the CRUST amazing?   Well first it was a delicious flavor, it was a bit thicker at the edges pieces (almost like a focacia) and thin and crispy yet filling in the middle. NOM, NOM, NOM. I ate all of the crusts! So GOOD!"}
{"text":"My shout out for best pizza go's to Aj's of Verona.  It is a delicious foldable crunchy crusted pie with the perfect amount of toppings.  I order at least 2 pizza's a week from these guy's.  Great staff and are always willing to help out our community with sales for hockey, baseball, and football.  I eat their pizza at baseball games all summer and will continue to be a faithful patron as long as you continue to be in business.   Great job fellas!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza spoiled by a poor conditions in the restaurant.  I will say that my family and I enjoyed our pizza - a delicious, hot thin-crust pizza with fresh toppings and good sauce.  What concerns, me, however, is the condition of the restaurant and the kitchen.  We decided to dine-in.  Initial impression was good - a fun little pizzeria with a pinball machine and a coin-op video game in the corner.  Another family was seated and appeared to be enjoying their pizza.  Things went south soon after we sat down.  Cleanliness is a problem for the restaurant.  There were flies buzzing all over and I was repeatedly brushing them off of our table, my kids and myself.  When the server brought a stack of plates, two of them were dirty and I had to exchange them for clean-er-ish ones.  The kitchen, visible from the counter by the entrance, didn't look super clean either.  I was also a little offended that the flat screen in the corner was tuned to one of those Pawn shop reality shows.  I had to explain to my kids why there was swearing and threats of violence (things I would never let my kids see or hear normally) on the TV.  If the owner expects families to dine there, it shouldn't be the responsibility of the patron to ask the owner to switch to something more family-friendly.  It's sad - we really enjoyed our pizza but that I won't be returning because I won't be able to eat it without questioning the sanitary conditions it was made in."}
{"text":"Call ahead or place your order online in advance to pick up, it is very very hot during the summer in the restaurant. We tried a Calzone and the Hot Italian. They were good."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Love their breadsticks, and their pizza is amazing. Their Chicago style pizza is only okay sadly, but their traditional pizza is my favorite in the area."}
{"text":"This place is the same as Falbos (which I also give  ) and I really love the pizza here. It is topped with many mushrooms if you order them. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would probably, if able, give them 2.5 stars.  We have tried both thin and stuffed. Our 2 experiences had both good and bad.  First, the good: I like the crust. It had good flavor and a nice crispness. The sauce is quite tasty. And the fresh veggies are delicious.  The bad: Let me start by saying that I'm originally from Chicago.  So I hold all pizza establishments to a high standard. One of the most important things, for me, on a pizza is the sausage. Both of the pizzas we've had included sausage. The stuffed was just sausage and the thin had green pepper, mushroom, red onion and, supposedly sausage and pepperoni.  I say \"supposedly,\" because both were finely ground and were practically nonexistent.  I almost had to use a magnifying glass to find any visible proof that they  weren't forgotten. And there was no evidence in the taste.  If I'm going to shell out $20 + I expect to taste the ingredients for which I've paid.  I also think they were a bit skimpy on the cheese. Pizza is all about the cheese. This simply didn't have enough cheese.  I used to be in management at a pizza place, so I know how much it actually costs to make a decent pie. AJ'S definitely did not give anything close to my money's worth for either pizza.  That being said, I cannot recommend this establishment.  Too bad, I had high hopes."}
{"text":"This place has excellent Pizza. The crust is awesome, just right for a thin crust, crispy and yet buttery soft. The sauce just tasted fresh as did all of the peppers and mushrooms on the supreme we ordered. We also tried the Mac and Cheese pizza and it was really good, home made Mac and Cheese with a olive oil and garlic sauce underneath. This place was outstanding and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to a new place for lunch. First the young man that waited on me was fantastic. He knew his stuff. Had fresh made fries and a great calzone. Loved both that I ate too much. So Good!"}
{"text":"So I called at 7:07 on a Monday night and ordered a pizza.  The kid that answered took my order told me they would be here between 35 to 45 minutes so at about 8 I figured I would call since the pizza hadn't arrived nor had anyone given me a phone call saying they were running late and they close at eight so of course nobody answers.. Then I call back at 8:10 and one of the smart ass workers there picks up the phone and says \"gotcha\" and hangs up on me.  Pizza never shows up and nobody calls.. Pretty pathetic AJs.. maybe hire some responsible people to work for you."}
{"text":"I love their BLT wrap!  As a joke for my son who doesn't like tomato, I got him a bacon, lettuce, turkey wrap.  Both were perfection!  I love their pizza, too.  What a treasure for Verona!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice , first I ordered a deep dish pizza and although the ingredients were fresh the pizza seemed undercooked. The top is cooked but the bottoms is a soggy mess. I thought maybe it was the way they made their deep dish so I ordered recent a thin crust and I got the same results, the toppings were still a bit raw and the bottom was soggy. If you like this style I suppose it wouldn't be so bad as the pizza was quite cheesy but it is a bit too raw for me. The cheese bread on the other hand was yummy. Will most likely not order again."}
{"text":"AJ's has the best pizza ever! We just moved here from Seattle and we are thrilled to have found this place. The Arizona Ranch pizza is incredible, as is the Bacon Cheeseburger pizza. I highly recommend AJ's - it's WAY better than anything from one of the pizza chains and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do NOT overlook this little pizza joint in Verona. I can understand the urge to play it safe and order from a chain, but if you go to AJ's you won't regret it! We have called AJ's for delivery two times since we moved to Verona and both times, we had our pizza within 20 minutes. The thin crust is SO good and their pizza reminds me of the pies you can only find in New York or New Jersey.  Tonight, my husband and I went out on a limb and ordered the Mac and Cheese pizza and it was amazing! We ate the entire thing rather quickly. My only negative is that the crust was a little overdone on the bottom.. But just a couple spots were burned and it didn't matter, the pizza was still delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Insanely delicious! I ordered the Mac n cheese pizza and it was out of this world good. So much flavor and fantastic crust."}
{"text":"Formerly Falbo's, until the owner branched out on his own. He's kept up the good work.   Not your choice for a fast, cheap pie -- for that, Domino's and Pizza Hut deliver -- but how does the saying go? \"Good food is not fast, fast food is not good?\" Having said that, the $5-two-slices-and-a-drink deal at lunch is a steal, especially if \"food coma\" tops your afternoon to-do list.  For the price, the pizza goes a long way because it's dense -- the crust is substantial and the toppings plentiful -- and the \"large\" is truly large.   If you're hankering for pizza in V'Town, AJ's should be your go-to choice."}
{"text":"The chicken wings were underseasoned, under-sauced, tough, and chewy. The breadsticks were also underseasoned, tough, and chewy, like they'd been under a heat lamp for many hours. It was also one of those breadstick orders that's just a pizza crust ut up into strips. Some people like that, but it's really not the same.  The mac and cheese pizza was pretty good.   I always like to get sides with my pizza, so terrible sides are a deal breaker for me, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Good pizza prompt delivery.  Felt like the pizza was perfect doneness and I like it thin crust. Cheese curds were not my favorite but okay."}
{"text":"Bad pizza, just bad.  Crust was flavorless with a cardboard texture and cheese was bland and had a plastic-like consistency.  It's pretty obvious they use low quality toppings and ingredients, and the result is boring, mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't know this place existed until today but my officemate and I had a hankering for pizza so we did a search for places that deliver and found AJ's. It wasn't the fastest I've ever had (we called when they opened, at 11 AM) so it could be that they have high volume at the start of their day because it took about 45 minutes to deliver at Epic, but it was delicious and totally worth the wait.   We got a deep dish special with one side the Deluxe and the other half the Spicy Chicken, both excellent. I liked that their Italian sausage is good quality with a lot of flavor and they don't scrimp on the toppings. Also, the crust was chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside - just right.  Definitely would recommend to anyone in the Verona area wanting some real pizza for delivery (not Dominos or Papa Johns)."}
{"text":"AJ's is awesome. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming, and the food is always hot and delicious! I highly recommend the Gyros and the Spicy Chicken pizza. Their hot subs are also bomb."}
{"text":"You don't find this style pizza very often around here. Nice thin crust, loads of cheese and cut into squares. When you are just looking for a good pepperoni and sausage pizza this is what you want. A lot of places are trying to reinvent the wheel but why mess with a good thing? That's what I like about AJ's, it's a step back from the super modern and \"hip\" pizza place where the owner came out and played hot wheels with my son so we could enjoy our lunch. Would have given 5 stars but it could use a decent cleaning, nothing gross but there were lots of crumbs and whatnot on the floor."}
