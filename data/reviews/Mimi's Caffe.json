{"text":"The food was fresh and home style. I had an egg sandwich was cooked well. The Coffee my partner ordered was good. Overall it was a little overpriced for what it was. It's decent but not quick."}
{"text":"Mimi's has a surprisingly large selection packed into a very small space.  They have prepared food, sandwiches, and a variety of baked goods.  They also have a number of coffee drinks.

I tried the turkey wrap which was pretty basic.  Would definitely like to go back and try some of their hot food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are adorable and friendly and the food is great. It's like going home to my parents' for a home cooked meal at lunch. It's unassuming, but a great find!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you find great food where you least expect it. Tucked in amongst the bust north side of Eglinton, a placard on the sidewalk caught my interest.

Being a relatively new transplant from King & Sherbourne, I was on the lookout for something to replace my beloved Betty's sandwiches - specifically the Klub Fred. I think I've found it in Mimi's BLT.

Family-run and friendly, I highly recommend this small establishment for lunch!"}
