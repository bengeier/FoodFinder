{"text":"I went here with my family today for breakfast as its Family day here in Ontario. Let me tell you it was great. Service was great, food was good and cost was half the price of Cora's and more food.  My son (2) and my daughter (4) and my wife enjoyed the food so much we are definitely coming back. Especially it's only five minutes from us."}
{"text":"Ok to be up front, it looks a bit like a 'dive' but the food is awesome!! I found this place driving around with my bro and sis on a Sunday early afternoon looking for an all day breakfast place. We thought it was a bit questionable from the outside, but what the heck, we tried it. Let me tell you that everything you order from the menu is awesome and tasted great! The typical plate we order is the chef's special which is: 2 pancakes or french toast, toast, bacon, sausage, home fries and 3 eggs prepared how you like 'em- you leave feeling the Michelin man. The steak and mushroom pie is so good, just thinking about it is making me drool....mmmm.  The service is also great, the woman (who's name escapes me at the moment) is great to joke around with and she is genuinely interested in you enjoying your meal. She definitely also makes you feel at home.  This has now become a my siblings' and I favorite place to go on Sunday afternoons, when you wake up hung over and need a hearty meal to help soak up whatevers left of Saturday in your system, this is the place to go."}
