{"text":"Very nice having this in our wonderful town. Looking forward to more locations like this opening up soon!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I made our second trip to this wonderful restaurant. The owners are unbelievable. The food, the atmosphere, and the people are the reason this is my new favorite restaurant. This is a complete hidden gem."}
{"text":"Gran Canal is a true hidden gem. Located in Sharpsburg, Michele and Antoinette provide such a genuine dining experience. I highly recommend the homemade veal cannelloni. The combination of marinara and b√©chamel sauces over top finish this dish nicely. I've also enjoyed their meatballs, chicken marsala and most importantly Michele's risotto. For this you must call ahead but totally worth it."}
{"text":"5 Stars hands down. The family owned Italian restaurant  is my favorite. I know I am just another soul writing on a cell phone, but words cannot express my sincere appreciation for this family and the food they deliver. The French Onion Soup is to die for. I always go with not just one portion of fettuccine pasta, I get one for the FOLLOWING DAY. It is my favorite Italian cuisine  in the world, having traveled over 5 different countries in my life (including Italy) and 29 states so far in the U.S as a 22 year old only Roma in Detroit, MI could keep up but the onion soup cannot be beaten. A must to any who are in the mood for an Italian classic."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful meal at Gran Canal tonight!!  It's worth seeking out this small caffe in Sharpsburg for the memorable veal cannelloni!!  These baked stuffed pasta tubes are amazing!!  Don't forget the shrimp San Marco or the occasional fried calamari & peppers special which is also spectacular!! Best little Italian restaurant that you've probably never heard of!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Veal Marsala and my wife had Scallops w/Linguine...   My wife enjoyed hers,  I disliked mine...  Marsala sauce is supposed to be savory and this sauce was sweet... It seemed like there was corn syrup in it (!)... Had the gloppy consistency of a Chinese food entree...  Since it came with rice pilaf,  it almost felt like I was sitting there eating Chinese takeout.    Dessert was vanilla gelato.  It was okay.  Service was spotty.  Upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the bar.   Despite the restaurant being half empty,  we stood there for 15 minutes until they cleaned off a dirty table and seated us there (?)...  It was a while before our waitress came to greet us... Drinks were served promptly most of the time...  Everyone was very pleasant though...  They seemed eager to please.  One other thing...  Another review noted the lack of tablecloths or placemats..  This bothered me as well...  My utensils are resting on the surface of a table that may or may not be entirely clean..."}
{"text":"We have been customers for over 16 years and have never had a bad meal. Michael and Antoinette, the owners, are wonderful people and take pride in providing a great dining experience. The veal cannelloni w bechamel sauce is a gastronomical delight as is the wild mushroom ravioli.  Definitely some of the best Italian food in the region."}
{"text":"I love this place, and I wish I lived closer. The wait staff is absolutely lovely and the food is legit old school Italian. There wasn't a disappointing dish on the table and the desserts were to die for."}
{"text":"Service is top notch, food is mouth watering, prices are very reasonable. Perfect for a romantic dinner, or get together with friends!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We're lucky enough to live just down the street, and come often.  The ravioli are my favorite. I've had every kind that they have regularly; mushroom, pear and classic ricotta, and they're all spectacular."}
{"text":"The menu is very limited. What they do have is expensive. $20 for pasta.  $10 appetizer was the size of a golf ball..no sharing this.  Chicken marsala  was so over the top sweet.  Yuck. Food took too long and service was ok. Won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Superb, family-friendly, authentic Italian in a very cozy ambiance. Michael and Antoinette make you feel like family every time. My family considers this our local favorite and has celebrated many events here. Great for groups, couples or anyone who appreciates a fantastic plate of real Italian home-cooking. Chef Michael taught me how to appreciate and prepare fine Italian food."}
{"text":"Wow!! Seriously, one of the best meals I have had out in a long time. From the Italian appetizer, mussels, to the cannelloni and phenomenal apple tart with homemade cinnamon gelato!! We could not stop eating!!...ohh and did I mention their bread?? Full bar. The restaurant is cozy!! The service was excellent.  Will definitely go back again and again!  Soo very glad I took the advice of those who rated this place 4+star. You truly were SPOT ON!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's a family business and they treat you like family!  The staff is very friendly. Every pasta dish I have had is absolutely wonderful, the specials are fabulous each time I go.  Portions are very large.  The shrimp appetizer and warm cheese is not to be skipped.  The desserts are excellent too."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving around, looking for somewhere to eat last night. I went onto my Urbanspoon app and this little gem popped up. Neither of us can say no to Italian food, so we decided to try it.  We were a little apprehensive at the exterior, but when we got inside were pleasantly surprised! It was quiet and clean, and we felt very underdressed after seeing the beautiful wine selection behind the bar.  We were waited on by the owner's daughter, who was incredibly pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the chicken and veal Marsala.  I am extremely picky about my Marsala. This was excellent! The starter salad with red wine vinaigrette  and Gorgonzola was also truly delicious for a simple salad.   We had to try dessert once we saw our neighbor's selections. I ordered the cannoli and my husband got the Limoncello cake. Both were amazing!  I need to note that everything here is homemade and you can tell! Everything is made with care and love and we will be back! I have never been so happy to have a smartphone!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here. We have gone with small groups, large groups, and just 2. We feel welcomed and very special when we see the owners, Michael and Antoinette, smiling at us as we walk in. The food choices are excellent. The wine list is perfect. The prices are terrific. Why you ask?  Well...there are homemade pastas, veal, veggie dishes, and fabulous specials.  The wine list is small and really characterizes the restaurant. Michael has really chosen well with regard to the wines.  Desserts....wonderful and again, a good size. Not crazy big...just enough. The pasta sauces are so delicious and vary by dish. Recommend it highly....tell them I sent you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Unpretentious (very) fine dining. Michael - the owner and head chef - makes food the way his family in Italy does - not too many ingredients so the flavors come out - using only the highest quality ingredients. He lets them speak for themselves. If he doesn't have just the right ingredient, the dish is not available: he had a pesto sauce with sliced potatoes, he had trouble getting the \"right\" potatoes, so no pesto dish. He made a shrimp dish with a certain lagostino - when he couldn't get them no other shrimp would do - the dish was not available. Very, very particular with his ingredients and it tastes like it!! When people ask what I would suggest, I tell them ANYTHING on the menu will be excellent or better! I've never had anything that wasn't delicious - and the aroma of the food - triple WOW!! Veal is the best I've had, cannelloni melts in your mouth, pasta dishes are amazing. Seafood is wonderful. BUT- save room for dessert! Most are made by Michael or his wife, and even the ones that are not (they would be from Italy) are to die for. Personal service, Michael comes out to check on you (he might even bring you your food).  Always a delight eating here!!! Double Bonus: They have recently fired up their pizza oven this winter after a few years of hiatus, for Wednesday only pizza night - I've had great pizza before (I even make a mean pie myself) and this is AS GOOD AS IT GETS!"}
{"text":"I love Gran Canal so much. This family owned restaurant is often my pick for a date night or taking out of town guests to dinner. Make a reservation if possible, because they're only open 3 nights a week! The owners are wonderful, charming people who really care about their customers.  Every meal comes with a great salad and warm bread. The pasta is fresh and the portions are large. If you don't have room for dessert they have a great selection of after dinner drinks (or digestifs) at the bar.  Also, I think I have had the best wine of my life here, which the State Store employee told me that they special order. So if you see a Dipinti Chardonnay - get it! Get the whole bottle!"}
{"text":"NOTE: A duplicate of a review of this place under a different name.  Just noticed that this place is listed under two different spellings: Grand Canal Cafe and Gran Canal Caffe...  At first glance, it's a charming little \"neighborhood\" Italian restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Simple decor, even a bit cheesy but in a lovable way.  It's comfy.  It's friendly.  You feel quite welcome when you arrive.  It's like dining with friends or extended family members.    Once inside, though, we were deflated by the decor.  There are NO windows, and an odd configuration to the two claustrophobic rooms.  The chairs aren't terribly comfortable and there are NO tablecloths.     But I didn't let any of that bother me because I had heard the food was terrific.  We ordered two appetizers to share: cured beef and scallops. Both were delicious.  We ordered the cannelloni and veal piccata.   The cannelloni was good, but nothing special.  The veal dish was average.    The biggest disappointment -- and a clue that attention to detail is NOT a specialty -- was the rotten lettuce in the salad.  Not one or two pieces of lettuce, but a good half-dozen in each salad were beyond wilted -- soft and brown.    We had gelato for dessert.  It was disappointing.    The service was reasonably attentive but ineffective.  We had to ask for water CONSTANTLY!!!!   And, after the first round of drinks before dinner, we were never asked if we'd have liked more.    Okay, but hey, it's a neighborhood restaurant, right?  Casual, family dining, right?   WAIT!  $110 for dinner for two at a \"neighborhood\" place?  For THAT kind of tab, I would have liked tablecloths, better service and a more even quality to the food.    We might go back, but I'm not sure..."}
{"text":"This small, family-owned Italian restaurant combines warm hospitality with great food. They make a number of dishes from scratch: cannelloni,  limoncello, cannoli, and more. For seafood lovers, the scallops and the lobster ravioli are fantastic. Decent vegetarian options, too, including a great ravioli al pesto.   My family has celebrated anniversaries and my wedding rehearsal dinner here, because of all the personal touches. The husband and wife owners try to talk to as many guests as they can; and, the husband is the chef, so they seem to be interested to hear reflections on the food and the restaurant.    Parking available behind the restaurant and very very limited street parking. Kids menus available.  Full bar available.   Worth the drive to Sharpsburg!"}
{"text":"Antoinette and Michael are very welcoming and extremely polite. For our dinner entr√©e, we had Pollo al Marsala and Shrimp San Marco. Both entree's were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of food. The bread severed with the entr√©e is delicious. We highly recommend a visit to the Gran Canal Caffe!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here last evening with my husband and some friends.  In one word...WOW! Start to finish, the entire experience was outstanding! What a hidden gem in Sharpsburg. We were warmly welcomed by the owners, service was excellent, and truly delicious homemade italian dishes (try the Canneloni). Salads and appetizers delicious as well. As we were the last ones to leave last night, we spent some time meeting and talking with Antoinette, Michael and family.  What great people.  Give this out of the way place a try, you'll be glad you did! I know we'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"After reading a few stellar 5-star yelp reviews, I decided to make Friday night dinner reservations at Gran Canal Caffe. (I suggest making reservations a few days in advance.) I'm glad that I did and will certainly be returning in the future.  Upon our arrival, we were warmly greeted by the bartender and waited just a few minutes to be seated.  The wine list is pretty extensive and surprisingly affordable for such a small restaurant. We ordered the pear and baked Brie for an appetizer and it was oh-my-god yummy. The Brie was gooey and runny and warm, which is just how it should be! Our meals included starter salads, which were pleasant. (Note: Try the limoncello dressing if you have a chance. It's light, yet flavorful.) The main dishes were really good, as well. Hubby had the pasta aioli and I had the shrimp San Marco.   The reason that I rate my experience at the Caffe as 4 stars, instead of 5, is two-fold: first, our server was overwhelmed by a large party and several others tables. We waited a pretty long time to ask for refills, etc.  Second, the menu, while delicious, is pretty limited to pastas and a few meat dishes.  There are only a couple fish and poultry options and most of them are pasta based.  Overall, a nice dinner and charming restaurant that I'll recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"It's one of those places where you wondered why you never visited before.  Tonight was out first visit here and we left feeling completely satisfied.  Service was impeccable.  Food fantastic. Price very fair. Greeted at the door by the owner.  How often does that happen? Had a cocktail or two at the bar while waiting for the other half of our party. When they arrived we took our table.  Had an assortment  of appetizers that we all shared.  We moved on to the main courses which were nothing less than stellar. Finished with dessert.   You can tell that it is a family affair and they all care.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place, wonderful food.  It was a pleasure to meet the owner and his wife. Michele and Antoinette made my meal very memorable.  Hopefully next time I'm in Pittsburgh I can have the pleasure of eating there again."}
{"text":"Gran Canal never disappoints. it has become our go to place where you can have both a wonderful meal and an atmosphere where you can sit with friends to laugh and share just what's new and old in your life. This week I walked in and was greeted by Michael in his perennial denim chef's jacket, big smile, and warm handshake. \"What's for dinner Michael.\" \"Comfort food, it's cold out, we need some food to warm the soul,\" he said. While the standing menu has a wonderful variety, the \"comfort food specials\" were: a warmed-melted cheese with roasted red pepper spread; a kale soup sweetened by distinguishable carrots, and a lasagne that was the best I've ever had--- and at 65 I've had a lot of lasagne. In fact, I tend not to order lasagne at a restaurant because I can find it well prepared at friends/family's homes. So bring on the comfort food, I'm game. The soup and cheese were delicious! But this lasagne was a sensory experience not to be missed. The blends of cheeses and touch of meat were so delicate that they flowed off of the fork and finished melting in your mouth before you barely chew and swallow. Don't you dare devour this, just let those flavors, textures and aromas linger before they slowly leave the palate. Wow! We had to pass all of our meals around the table, each were so enjoyable. My table mates had Veal Marsala and Ravioli stuffed with three types of mushrooms. The veal was very tender and the vapors and taste of the marsala made each bite a sweet treat. The flavor of the ravioli was earthy and invited you to eat every last bit. As usual the meals were accompanied by the fresh crisp house salad, our favorite dressing is Michael's house made Lemoncella which we top off with gorgonzola. Fresh warm bread and olive oil are more than fillers, they are what makes bread worth eating. The finales left us with smiles on our faces: a cheese cake, made with Marscapone cheese, that New Yorkers would travel to Pittsburgh to eat---topped with warmed black cherries; Apple Tart with a side of Michael's delicately flavored homemade cinnamon gelato; and a flourless chocolate cake---that was definitely not off the back of USA Gourmet or Sysco's trucks. Don't miss Gran Canal, take friends that enjoy talking to and laughing with over good wine, beer, and wonderful foods."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Very quaint and cozy. Our server was great , meals were DELISH ! I had a hard time making a choice because it was our first time here. Will definitely be back to try another dish."}
{"text":"Awesome food as well as awesome service! Definitely a nice hidden gem!  A great find..."}
{"text":"First pizza night! Every Wednesday night in November and December. Awesome pera e brie tonight along with an amazing margherita. Michele is the real deal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and meal very much. The tomato soup was to die for!!! Tiramisu was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Actually 3.5 for food and 4+ for service and setting. We tried shrimp app which was delicious. For entrees, baked gnocchi was superb. Light dough and savory traditional sauce. Chicken Marsala had a thin Demi-glac√© type sauce...wish there had been more sauce. It's your typical family-run old school Italian restaurant. They make you feel at home, like you're part of the family. On a narrow street in Sharpsburg, great place when you need a dose of cozy, Italian comfort."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Called and made reservations and was not informed that they would be having a limited menu.  We only found out of the limited menu once we sat down.  Being allergic to shell fish there was a dish on the limited menu that I asked if it possible to replace the fish with something else and I was informed it was pre-made.  So I ordered the beef ravioli with a demiglaze it had no flavor.    The other item we ordered was chicken cacciatore with sauteed vegetables.  The dish was delivered with rice no vegetable when asked about the saut√©ed vegetables we were informed it was in the sauce.  The server and the owner knew we weren't happy with our meals but never tried to correct the situation.  I would not go back or recommend.  If a restaurant is having a limited menu they should inform the customer when they make reservations."}
{"text":"Pasta is phenomenal. Service is great. Only drink wine beer or pop because the water is awful. The only reason I can't eat here is the water it was so bad. I hope they get a filter for their water system because I loved their food!"}
{"text":"You will feel like family in this small family owned restaurant. The food is so delicious and all homemade. Try to save room for dessert they are all made from scratch and are out of sight!!I can't say enough about this restaurant it is so great, you will not be sorry you went. It is my favorite Italian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I had looked forward to eating here because over the years I had heard good things. The wait staff was professional and the ambiance was nice, but the pasta was so-so - not house made as I had been told when I asked, but out of the box pasta, fine if you are cooking at home, but substandard for restaurant fare. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Italian food ever! Homemade pasta melted in my mouth ! Sauce was the best I have ever had! I lived in Bloomfield for years and had plenty of Italian food but believe me this was by far the best!  Did not have a reservation on New Year's Eve and asked if my husband and I could eat at the bar...hospitable, friendly and accommodated us perfectly! I highly recommend  this as the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh by far!"}
