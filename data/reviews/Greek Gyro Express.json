{"text":"Friendly service (5 out of 5) and free soup is offered while you wait!!! The food is GREAT. Will def go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my favorite gyro place and their salad is perfect. I come here at least twice a month. I crave their delicious gyro!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very nice staff. The takeout is easy. Complimentary soup du jour is included in every order. The restaurant should be kept cleaner/bussed."}
{"text":"The Greek food is alright  Positives:  -Soup on the side -Entertainment of Greek music and TV"}
{"text":"I have finally found a great gyro! Not a big pita bread fan so I've been disappointed in the past, but not after eating here.The food was awesome! My boyfriend and I ordered the Gyro Sandwich combo w/ the feta fries. Everything was on point, including the FREE chicken lemon rice soup. The gyro meat was flavorful and juicy and the feta gives another dimension of \"Yum\" to the fries. Also,  they don't skimp on portions.  Lets just say my buds (taste buds) were very happy after leaving!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome, we go for lunch all the time. The feta French fries are a great compliment to their tasty gyros."}
{"text":"Their Greek salad with chicken is sooo delicious and you get a pita and choice of soup even to go mmmm so yummy. Great customer service. I picked up lunch for the office and they where super efficient and quick great prices as well."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot quick still tasty but the staff are curious & they have complimentary soup which I think is a cool idea And They have a show that tours GREECE! I will go before I die!"}
{"text":"Great local family business! Best Greek food ever! Run by a real Greek family. Very hard working customer oriented staff.  Free lemon rice soup while you wait for your food (which is excellent). I have a friend that drives all the way from Scottsdale because he loves the food here. Closed Sunday's."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of the best lunch spots in the valley. Delicious greek food at great prices. It's been a family favorite of ours since the day we learned of it."}
{"text":"my husband and I really enjoyed our meal today.  We both ordered the combo gyro plate.  We substituted salad for the french fries.  The salad had lots of cucumber, tomato and feta cheese.  The gyro had lots of meat and the bread was hot and fresh.  Very tasty!  We were pleasantly surprised when we were told to help ourselves to a free bowl of soup while we waited for our order to be prepared.  I had the lentil soup and it was pretty good.  This also came with a drink.  All this for $6.99!  What a deal. The food tasted delicious and so fresh.  The owner seemed very attentive and came to our table to ask how everything was.   I wish I could come back often, but we live in Calif--we're only passing through on the way home from the Grand Canyon."}
{"text":"Literally the best Greek food I've ever had!!! Highly recommend!! I didn't think I liked Greek food until I ate here. Also love their chicken lemon soup and lentil soup. Everything I've had was delicious and the people working their are very friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the free soups and good for while you wait but it's not fast. But it doesn't taste like fast food either. It's worth the wait just don't go on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Not my first Greek gyro or restaurant, but the food here was better than the others I've been to. The owner was very eager to help my wife order and get the \"greek experience\", he helped her order the delicious greek fries. Greek fries sound odd, but are actually quite delicious, crinkle fries + feta cheese are a great twist on an american dish. The soups were great, gyro meat was tender and well cooked. All in all a great place for people hesitant to try Greek food."}
{"text":"I try and stop in this place at least once a month, and sometimes more if cravings are not satisfied ;)  Beleive its the owners son that usually runs the counter when I come in and gotta asy he is always very nice and service oriented! I mean how do I say this without offending anyone, usually younger people in the service industry have a real crap attitude, so coming here is really refreshing and the food is yummmm. Last time I went in the son was sampling their Greek Rice Pudding and all I got to say is OMG, sooo good :)  So, give this place a try and support the local shops."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everyone was super friendly. There was a bit of a wait but you can tell it was just made! The only thing bad I have to say is the dr. pepper was flat.  We both got the gyro combo and it was stellar. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the past few years. Food is just alright though really. The only reason I still go here is because it's the only place on this side of town to get gyros. Not the best hummus either but like I said, if you're craving and you don't have the energy to drive all the way to the east side, then it will have to do.   What's really good here, I would have to say is the complimentary soup that they advertise that comes with any purchase. That my friend is good.   I was a little disappointed though because I called in for an order for pick-up and the long-haired gentleman at the cashier did not offer me any. Tsk. I almost wanted to ask since I know they always give you the soup, but I wanted to see if he would offer and sadly he didn't. I know that in the past, even when I ordered food to go, they would give me the small container for the soup (that tall stack that was waving at me behind the baklavas)   There was this couple though that were waiting for their food to go who brought some soup with them. The long-haired gentleman generously gave them 4 SODA CUPS (not the soup container) so they can take lotsa soup home. I just watched while waiting. Lovely."}
{"text":"With 4 1/2 stars I was excited about this place... Then we went inside. I'm trying to figure out where 3 1/2 of their stars came from. You walk in and this place has a \"grimy\" look and feel. But I've learned you can't judge the food by the restaurant's appearance. We ordered our food with a very uninterested cashier (who obviously has better things to do that don't involve us or our order). We ordered hummus, a chicken gyro, a Chicago burger, a drink and a side of rice... $26?! WTF mate?! Henywho, we'd ordered so we had some soup while we waited. I didn't get the hype, the soup tasted like it came out of a Campbell's can but it was free and we were hungry (Free-ish, at $26 for what we ordered I'm sure we paid for the soup). Ate our soups got our hummus and it was ok, not the best but at least the pita bread was warm. We managed to finish our soups and our hummus and still waited 15 minutes for our food! 15 MINUTES, for a total of almost half an hour at a place called Gyro \"Express\". The cashier/ waitress threw our food on the table and walked away. My husband's Chicago Greek burger was a decent burger, nothing special and his Greek fries we're the same, just French fries with a sprinkle of feta cheese and oregano (not the deliciousness I tasted at Pita Kitchen). My Greek chicken pita managed to be dry even though it was smothered in taziki sauce, a ridiculous amount of taziki, I used a napkin between every bite and it was so annoying I gave up on eating it. We ordered a side of rice for our 2 year old, it was bland and because someone got oregano happy, it tasted like pure oregano. So that's my experience, it was a waste of time, money and taste buds.  Never again."}
{"text":"Far and above one of the best places I've been for a few reasons:  1) The food was absolutely fantastic.  The Greek salad and feta fries were absolutely a wonderful start.  The falafel is absolutely fabulous.  I love it!  It's made fresh, and you can totally taste it.  2) The service here is wonderful.  It's not the extremely fast service, but it's the kindest.  It's a family business, and they take their customers seriously.    I'll 100% go there again!"}
{"text":"For the food, price & service this place has to be the best gyro restaurant in Avondale. It's a little hidden gem in this neighborhood. Food is always good. The service is always fantastic. The two young men behind the counter are always friendly & efficient. Definitely one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Dont let the location keep you away.I have eaten here several times.the gyro meat is seasoned to perfection.i usually get.  Slovaki  plate.i.may have misspelled.lol but anyway Greek salad, pita bread,greek cream,gyro meat shaved and tasty and a skewer of greek seasoned chicken.all good.I also have a bowl of complimentary soup while I wait.Lentil or lemon chicken soup.both are good. .for dessert.  Simple Connolly.or.  slice of their blaklava . Everybody I ever took with me to eat here has always enjoyed every bite.great place to eat real Greek food .enjoy"}
{"text":"I just love this place. They have really delicious gyros and amazing fries. They put feta cheese on the fries, and for a little extra, they will give you a big bowl of feta. (What's with this dude and feta?) I'll tell you what, it's amazing and I love it, especially on their gyros and fries! Same with the tsatsiki (white cucumber sauce). I've never had a complaint about this place. Love it."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing.  We loved the soup and great customer service.  We ordered two gyros and the gyro fries.   The gyros were fresh and delicious.  I would say they were the best gyros I've ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!! Everything I have had is great!!! From the soup to the gyro to the baklava to the hummus to the spinach pie and nice big portions, I always have enough to take home for tomorrow! The server is always very nice too!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to gyro joint, best one in the west valley. The gyros are always overfilled with meat and their salads are great. Fantastic quality and quantity of food and overall great value!"}
{"text":"This place was really great! The falafel was tasty and plentiful and the soup was an excellent surprise. Everything was hot and fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food! We've been eating here for over a year now and each time have found the food incredibly great.  Food is very fresh and their free soup is a big plus!  I highly recommend this little hole in the wall!  Great food!"}
{"text":"Best Greek gyros I've had in Phoenix.  The gyro meat is seasoned well and it's not salty like other places I've been to. There is a complimentary soup along with your meal, very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food was lacking flavor fries were frozen fries that dipping sauce didn't have any flavor place needs a remodel"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Gyros are good, Greek fries are okay. Place was real messy when I came in, dirty tables with food plates still on them. They have free homemade soup, which there was none left when I looked to get some. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"great food. got the falafel plate, would highly recommend. But it is lots of food so be prepared :)"}
{"text":"This place is my second favorite go to for Gyros and Greek/Mediterranean food. They offer yummy soup as well. And I love the feta cheese they spread on the Gyros and the French fries. The customer service is awesome too. A nice tight local family feel.  Good price. Yum!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite greek food in the area! The service is always wonderful! I love that it is a friendly, family-owned business. The food is delicious and I love that it comes with yummy soup to eat while you wait. I recommend it to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Started out so promising.......why is it when small restaurants start out great they get comfortable and fizzle...been here several times and each time I see and taste the decline.The gyros were great then tasted as if they've been under the lamps all day. Why is it that the tables are always dirty and only a handful of people are seated? I wish I could say I'm going back."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to visit. Came here for dinner and was met with great customer service. It is truly a great atmosphere. The food was tasty and everything was done perfect. Will eat here again the next time I visit from CA. I recommend this place to everyone and trust me, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Last night my boyfriend went to pick up dinner last night and we found a MAGGOTS in my salad. After 2 years of eating there we will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom the other day to try it out and I was glad that I did. Even thought we got it to go, the food was still fresh and hot when we got home and the gyros were delicious! I would have liked a little bit more feta cheese on the fries, but other than that they were good too.   They lady at the front was very nice and held a little conversation with me when she wasn't busy. Definitely going back to try some other things."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several time.  The food is flavorfula nd the staff is so nice.  Not a bad place for a quick lunch or dinner.   Pro- menu options are the classics and come with plenty of food.  You get soup with every meal and then 2 options of soup are very flavorful. Saldas are very flavorful and i would order one everytime. Service time is fast as well.   Con- the food is a little on the greasy side for me.  Also, the kabobs are not consistent- the chicken is tender, the pork is to dry and the lamb was overcooked. Spinach pie was dry as well."}
{"text":"Remember how your parents taught you that if you had nothing good to say, don't say anything at all?  :|"}
{"text":"The best gyros on the west side!  Heck, maybe even the best gyros in the Phoenix metro area.  We always order the gyro sandwiches (practically exploding with tasty gyro meat, tomatoes, onions and yummy tzaziki sauce (you know, the yogurt, cucumber, garlic dressing -- yeah, that one... the one you lick off your fingers everytime you get it because you don't want to miss a drop of it?) in a warm soft pita and split an order of greek fries -- french fries with just the perfect amount of feta.  Fabulous.  This is a nice family owned place that is definitely worth trying if you are on the west side and have a hankering for some great gyros."}
{"text":"Recently in the area and looking for a place to get some lunch. Saw good reviews for this place on Yelp, so decided to give it a try.  We stopped in about two in the afternoon on a Friday. We ordered a gyro and the Mediterranean fish sandwich. For $2 more you can upgrade to a combo with a choice of Greek fries or salad and a drink. My friend ordered the fries. I ordered a salad. The cashier asked if we wanted soup and gave us bowls for soup and a number for our order. The girl taking our order wasn't very welcoming and didn't explain the free soup, however we knew about the soup from reading about it on Yelp.   The soup was delicious! A lentil and a lemon rice. They were hot and flavorful! We ate our soup and waited. And waited. And waited. Twenty minutes went by and two tables that came in before us got there food. Five more minutes went by and we decided to ask about our food. At that point, we were told that fish takes at least twenty minutes. Another five minutes went by before we got our food. Thirty minutes total. We were hungry and annoyed at this point. I guess that's why they offer the free soup!  The gyro was good. The salad was good. The Greek fries were okay. Regular fries with feta cheese on top. The pita bread was the best part of the meal. The downside was the fish, which is what took so long. On the menu, it said it was grilled. Okay, so maybe it was cooked on a grill. What i got was what looked like a very thin, breaded, pan fried piece of fish. It was disappointing. I tried to take the breading off, but the fish was so thin there was little or no meat left to eat. At that point, I just gave up. After waiting so long and then getting something that wasn't cooked the way it was described on the menu, I was no longer hungry.   The food was okay but not worth the wait. And, they really do need to change the description of the Mediterranean fish and let people know it takes twenty minutes to cook, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here expecting typical mediocrity, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality, and the service! Seemed short staffed, but those guys were on it! there was a big family and a few others making large orders, but those guys handled it like pros! Portions were very generous, prices were fair, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Go for the pleasant demeanor of Theodore and his eagerness to be of assistance to anything you could possibly need and also refusing your tip jar money (nice try, you get a fiver) and stay for the food anyway.  Free soup, fresh baklava and Theodore.   You're welcome."}
{"text":"Ate here again for lunch and the Gyro Sandwich was very good. Place was cleaner and service was good this time around. Will definitely go back for a Gyro and of course a couple of great tasting cannoli's.   Wife loved the Greek Salad with Gyro meat."}
{"text":"The gyros are about par with other places.  Falafel is meh.  Service is SLOW so don't come here during the rush.  Seriously, they had 1 guy in the back and one in the front.  It took 20 minutes to get our food and that's when I actually started keeping track.  On the upside, they offer complimentary soup which was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Popped in here after a visit to Sam's Club and honestly wasn't expecting much. Wow was I surprised! One of the better gyros I've had in a while, and one that rivals the late night vendors in Europe, but without the greasy feeling next morning. I tried the Chicken Gyro, but with tzatziki instead of honey dijon dressing. Absolutely delicious. The Greek Fries were yummy, though a little more cooked than I prefer. They offer free soup while you wait for your order. And the guys behind the counter were wonderfully nice and accommodating of everyone in the restaurant. You could definitely tell that they cared about making it an enjoyable dining experience for their customers. I know where I'll be going next time I have a hankering for some Greek food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel, and it took fucking 40 minutes to get it!!! Are you fucking kidding me?! No fries, no drink, just a fucking falafel!! The food is good, service is just horrendous. It's also overpriced, I would go pita kitchen down the street."}
{"text":"Always perfect, takes longer than some places due to the fact its actually made to order.    Very consistent, food always hot and tasty, salad always cold and fresh, soup (free) always good.   My only complaint would be the hummus but thats my personal taste however it is fresh......but I like my hummus creamy.     Gyro meet is always awesome, not steamed and soggy like some places, this is ALWAYS nice and shaved fresh off the spit......nice and actually cooked.    Never disappoints.   Keep up the good   work, family owned to which is nice.   Oh, love the greek fries too, simple but nice.......ketchup with the feta cheese taste so good, think they put oregano on there too.....not sure.   Check it out peeps!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Greek gyro could have turned out very bad if not for Brianna as I have severe food allergies, she went WAY out of her way to check ingredients for me. I so appreciate it. Great job Brianna!!!!"}
{"text":"When I went there with my wife daughter we were the only people in there. With that in mind the service was extremely slow. It took almost 15 minutes to get our food. The gyros we ordered were skimpy on the meat. They were also dry and barley warm. For the price I was expecting more food. The quality reminded me of cafeteria food. This was the first time and last time I will go there. I found a better place to get my gyros from that is right down the road."}
{"text":"Heard this place was mom/pop place and decided to check it out. Food was good and fresh and people were really friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know why I drop 1 star but there is something about it that I can't give it a 5 stars. The food is good I have no complain but it is so so... very decent simple Greek :)"}
{"text":"Their food was great! They give you free soups while you dine and let me tell you.. They are delicious!! Great little gem."}
{"text":"the food here is amazing the portions are great and the prices are right on point. it is difficult to find good foreign restaurants in this area but this is one of them."}
{"text":"This is my GO TO spot for a Gyro in the west valley. The Gyro combo has always been right on the money, You can order it with ether fries or Greek salad. Try ether and you will leave happy."}
{"text":"Free soup while you wait?  Sample as soon as you walk in?  Service from owner?  Yes, Yes and Yes!  I am SO happy I walked in here unplanned one day.  Me, my husband and my daughter ate for 15 bucks!  Everything was authentic and delicious!  The service was fast and helpful and it just made you feel good.  This is the ultimate lunch experience!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but was disappointed. The free soup was good but chicken was dry and not that tasty. Salad wasn't great either. The young man who works there is so nice and friendly. I really enjoyed talking to him"}
{"text":"Again Excellent Gyros. It's the only thing I get here because it's so good. Plenty of meat not like other places. Lemon rice soup is a bonus because  it comes with anything you order.  Clean and friendly family owned business"}
{"text":"Everything is good here. I'm not a soup person, but their soup is great. Fries are a must have. I typically get their gyros meal with fries. Service is pretty good, the guy that took care of us was very energetic."}
{"text":"I love this place. They make the best gyros! The meat was juicy, hot, and delicious. The place is clean, prices are reasonable, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Food is delicious with reasonable cost.   No hassles when trying to redeem coupons as some other places do, using coupons as a bait and switch tactic.  Love both the free soups, chicken rice and lentil while you wait for main meal.  We will continue to be faithful customers."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this wonderful little place since it opened. The budget friendly menu, family atmosphere, friendly staff and outstanding food keep us coming back time and time again.  The complimentary lemon chicken rice soup is amazing while you wait. Every entree from the gyros to the hummus, spanikopita and salads are consistently fresh and wonderfully flavored. There is a large menu selection and a great variety.  Theodore, one of the sons of the original owner, takes the time to get to know every customer.  We've never had a bad meal here. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Best spot for Greek on the west side hands down! Very reasonable prices and food on point, along with the service."}
{"text":"Being from the Windy City, it's nice to come to a place that reminds you of \"Home\". Great tasting food, Great service and it is family owned and operated. Whether your in the mood for a Gyro Sandwich or a Greek salad you cannot go wrong with anything that you order from here. Food is made to order and is always fresh. Deserts are also great from here.  I highly recommend Greek Gyro Express."}
{"text":"Gyro sandwich is about average. I got the \"Greek fries\" which are fries with some feta cheese and herbs on top of shoestring fries. Fries were nothing special. But they offer two kinds of soup with your order, which was nice. Overall I thought the food was average, but they were really friendly and I liked the self-serve soup, so they get four stars. Food was three stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good gyro.  Ordered extra meat and they delivered.  I have always hit up Pita Kitchen once a week but now torn.  Well played."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here since they've opened with the family. Their menu has a variety and some dishes are vegetarian friendly. A definitely must try if you're in the area. They also provide bowls for soup while you wait. Lemon chicken and rice or Lentil soup. The great thing about it is that they are super friendly."}
{"text":"This is hands done our go to place. Birthday, date night, you name it. The owner is like family and the food shows his dedication to serving the best food to every customer. We literally crave the  amazing Greek gyro that he makes!"}
{"text":"Delicious, hit the spot!  Super nice staff too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Hands down best gyros in town.  I typically get gyros salad, even the small is a ton of food.  Comes with free lemon orzo soup which is DELICIOUS.  When I do gyros plate, their feta fries are to die for.  The woman typically behind the counter and her brothers own it, they are always super friendly and on top of things.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a shot and really enjoyed the food. It was well priced, plentiful, and most importantly - delicious! The restaurant was clean and the service was friendly and efficient. We had no complaints."}
{"text":"I have ordered out from this place twice both times the Gyro meal. The Gyro is legit. Very good and exactly what I was craving. The fries are good but would be a lot better if they were crisp. I'm not sure if it's the 10min drive home in which they get a little soggy but they are the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. Despite the fries his place is really reasonable for the price and how good the gyro is and the amount you receive is the reason I will continue ordering from it."}
{"text":"This place is solid! I ordered at lunchtime for pickup and the lady said it would be 15 minutes-- I got there in 15 minutes right as my order came out, perfect! I had the falafel gyro and it delicious. My gyro was overflowing with big falafels, I couldn't ask for more, and the pita was also nice and soft. My friend got the regular gyro and she said it was tasty as well. The tzatziki sauce was great as well."}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant in the West Valley! My favorite is the Grilled Chicken Salad. The Chicago hotdog and fries with feta cheese are soooo ggoooood too! I love their free soup ,Chicken lemon soup or lentil soup. The staff are really kind and respectful. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Folks saying this place is great, either have never had Greek Gyros before or are related to the owners.  Not good at all.  Small portions, dry, chewy meat with grissle.  Yuk.      Now let's all gasp in awe of Rob T. down there and his awesome skills at judging Jodi for having an opinion that's different than his.  Dork."}
{"text":"Great little Greek sandwich spot in Az. Gyros are very tasty and the fries with feta cheese was delicious. Love the Greek music playing in the backround! Every thing on the menu comes with free chicken rice soup and lentil soup and both are made fresh daily. Prices are under 10 dollars! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The chicken greek salad is the best! Plus the soup that is included you can't beat! The food is fresh and never disappoints!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Just left here, food was plentiful and I'm full! Soda machine not working so am dying of thirst have to stop somewhere else to get more drink! Food was hot when served  gyro needed more sauce in middle, it was dry there! Overall it was tasty, won't be a regular but every now and then I may be back! Free soup was nice because the wait was not real short!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and got a sampling of the menu to try, We were very happy with the food and I have to say that the nice young lady who took the order got everything right. It is on the West side, just off I-10 so easy off and then back on, as we live west of the 303. The hot food was hot, the salad was cold and crisp when I got home, about the salad; greens were fresh, all ingredients tasty and dressing very good. Portions of a good size, pitas were also fresh and not overly chewy, The taztiki creamy and tasty, yes I know I am using \"tasty\" lot but it was. The only thing that I felt could be better is the spanakopita needs a bit more feta in it fo my taste, but it had a homemade quality with a hint of lemon flavor that was quite nice. So we'll be back..."}
{"text":"The food at Greek Gyro Express is DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC! They give soup with the purchase of a meal and the chicken and rice soup was the first indication of how great the food would be. The chicken souvlaki sandwich and gyro platter were outstanding! From the pita bread, to the homemade tzatziki... I have no doubt that everything on the menu is as tasty! Definitely recommend visiting this place. I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, gyros and fries. Lentil soup is great.  Friendly staff and very courteous.   Would highly recommend for anyone looking to do Greek."}
{"text":"Easily one of your best options for lunch in Avondale / Goodyear.  Better-than-fast-food prices and portions, excellent food (especially the souvlaki and the gyro), and great service.  Yes, the fries are very simple, almost McDonald's-ish, but the feta and oregano set them off and they are a great compliment to every meal.  And if that's not your cup of tea, swap it out for salad for the same price.  The free soups (Lemon chicken rice, lentil) are both fantastic as well.  Now let's all gasp in awe at Jodi down there and her awesome skills at judging cannoli through glass.  That's impressive stuff."}
{"text":"Looking for something different, I found Greek Express at the top of the best rated list. The location is easily accessible, the staff is very friendly, and the food is fantastic. I ordered a gyro sandwich with the Greek salad as the side, and I would do it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food great prices. They even have free soup that is really good."}
{"text":"Good food although garbage service. I order a takeout order at 11:45am while on lunch break and was told 15 minuets. I show at noon only to wait until 12:35. Which is triple the time was told. Then her reason why food was not done is there busy. I ordered a gyro sandwich and beef sandwich yet it takes nearly an hour helping miss my entire lunch break."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for so many different reasons!!! It is clean. It is conveniently located.  I adore the brothers that work there. They are by far the MOST personable service workers I have encountered in eons! They are amiable and TRULY seem to enjoy their customers. Every time I go in they treat me as though I'm their favorite customer, although I'm pretty sure they don't recognize me. The food is delicious, although I have had better hummus. The souvlaki dinner and falafel platter are divine.  Someone in a different review may have mentioned the free lemon rice and lentil soups. They are hotter than the surface of the sun and delicious! Get there early or all the chicken will be pilfered from the lemon soup!  The only real downside to this family owned & run restaurant is one of the gals who works there during the day. She just doesn't seem to enjoy her job as much as the brothers. She almost seems afraid to engage the customers. Perhaps she's shy or unsure if herself. Give her a Baklava and a hug and tell her to engage- customers like that!!"}
{"text":"My favorite little Greek spot. I like the Greek salad w/ Gyro meat and the spinach pie. The rice pudding is also good. They give you a choice of chicken lemon rice soup or bean soup with every order. The place is always clean and the service is great."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro plate and it was very good.  The serve yourself soup you get to eat while waiting is wonderful.  I ordered the spanakopita on the side and it wasn't the best but it was good.  I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot,however as of late they are taking forever to bring you your food and the taste is different. Looks like they might have changed cooks. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Greek gyro with fries. They offer free soup but I haven't tried it. The meal is plenty enough for anyone and trust me you'll eat it all. The best Greek food in the west valley since Ararat closed down."}
{"text":"Very good food. Wait for my food was slightly long for an \"express\" restaurant. Although they did say it was an unusually busy day & admitted to being behind. Hopefully staffing issue is fixed for future."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but I waited over 20 minutes for a Gyro and salad. If you like Greek food it is worth going to. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great...very friendly. I had the chicken lemon lentil soup which was OK, a Greek salad with chicken, which was tasty; however I wish the Greek salad dressing was more flavorful. The highlight of my meal was the pita bread. I'm from the East Coast and back there they give you a very dry, bland piece of pita. This pita was thick and buttery so yummy, I dipped it in a small side of hummus. The texture of this hummus was not as thick as I'm used to, but just as flavorful. I will definitely be back for more pita and hummus!"}
{"text":"They have great Gyros very original ingredients nice olives, feta and warm pita. You can get extra sauce heavy tomatoes or my favorite the onions.  Like it to go they will prepare to go as well for anyone."}
{"text":"The gyro was good. The fries had a nice surprise, feta cheese. Overall fair price and good food. Will recommend."}
{"text":"Love it, been there twice in 10 days. You leave full but it is a good full. Great meat Gyro with salad, plus a drink and soup, for about $7, hard to beat that. Not much for decor, but service is quick and the place is clean. Sometimes busy but seems like they have a steady business with clientele that know they are getting great food at a great price. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you, help yourself to soda and soup. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I don't work far from here, so I like coming here once in a while for lunch. I always call ahead to order and when I get there, my food is always ready and waiting for me. I always take some of the lemon chicken and rice soup to go with me. I haven't had anything other than their Greek salad with gyro meat, which is delicious. The meat isn't dry nor fatty. It compliments my salad nicely and I love the soft, warm pita bread that accompanies my salad!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and thought we would stop and try their food. It was really good. Full of flavor. The cashier/waitress was very nice & helpful. I even heard her offer another customer a different option and he even saved money. Unheard of in today's economy, but great customer service, and wonderful food keep them coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant. Cool atmosphere inside, gyro meat was amazingly tender, tzatziki sauce perfect, and hard to beat free soup while you wait! Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, I've never been disappointed.  Portions are deliciously huge, food is just wonderful.  The cashier's attitude sucks, but you can't have everything. I'll gladly take her \"I could give a shit\" attitude as long as the cooks in the back keep making delicious food :)"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a long time and I was very disappointed today. The woman at the counter was VERY rude. When she gave me my receipt she practically slapped it down on the counter. She did not give us soup bowls and when the guests after us asked for them she acted like she didn't want to give them any either so I didn't even bother to ask. The woman obviously wasn't having a good day and was taking it out on her customers. Typically they give us sauce with our combos and we didn't get that either. The fries are normally very good but today they tasted like they had been sitting for a long while. Im thinking that they are trying to cut costs because even the salad and gyro was skimpy on the toppings, not like it used to be."}
{"text":"Great food!! Picked up a Gyro sandwich and fries and it was very tasty! My 11 year old finally tried the Gyro and LOVED it! She kept saying how delicious the meat was! Excellent service. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Not really fast, but good! We had the chicken souvlaki \"sandwiches\" - they come with tzaziki instead of honey dijon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the west valley! The staff are always super friendly and the food is so good. I always order the gyro plate which comes with their amazing Greek fries and all food comes with free soup (which is also really good!). I get their baklava too and it's made fresh in their kitchen every day. The place is always clean and they have a video about Greece playing which is super cool to watch when you're waiting for your food. It's always super fast service too!"}
{"text":"Good food! Nice establishment. The soups, chicken lemon rice and lentil soup, are so good!!! Mom really liked the lentil soup. Got mom's seal of approval!!! Chicken salad was delicious!!! Worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"They have earned us as life time customers. Food is always great. Soup is always delicious customer service is amazing.  Definitely recommend eating here.  my first post was two years ago. and in april of 2018 we are moving out of the state. this is thebplace were eating befroe we leave. this is the only place my hisband will miss. the prices have gone up a little but for the good food and friendly service we definitely dont mind. we still highly recommend this place.  and if we ever come back to az. this will be our first stop"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in the West Valley hands down. But also the brothers that run the place are people that  inspire other siblings. They are so hard working  Have great attitude and manners . They makes the food and atmosphere that much better! We have been coming here since 2008.......it's been that good for that long that I just forgot to write a review. The other staff are just as good and while you wait for your food they have Greece Travel paying on the TV. We get the gyro plate and the soups are amazing. Check them out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being a Greek himself, my husband knows good Greek food.  We both agree the food  here is delicious.  However, I called on 3 X in 2 days to place a catering order.  Finally decided to fax the order & hope they get it in time to prepare it all  The food was ready when requested & delicious as usual. Other than the ordering process, I give this restaraunt 4 Stars!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food at a reasonable price. Staff is always friendly and quick. To-go orders are always packed well and complete. If you're in the mood for a gyro, stop by. I definitely suggest this place over Dino's up the road."}
{"text":"I used to be a pizza, taco, and burger kind of guy.  Now I'm a gyro guy.  I've had gyros before, but wow!  These gyros are freakin' delicious!  I plan to take my wife there, and she better like it, or else I'm finding a wife who will. Seriously folks, this is great food.  I can't wait to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gyro place to go to. Best gyros on the west valley. I usually get the gyro sandwich combo, it comes with their fresh made soup, so good while you wait! My wife loves the fresh made salads and home made baklava. The staff there is friendly, you can dine in or call ahead and pick up your food when you arrive. Family owned business, get the feel right when you walk through the door. A must try if you are on the west valley."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! We just happened upon it this afternoon for lunch but I just really enjoyed myself at this restaurant and I really, really enjoyed the food. They have a small selection on there menu but everything on their menu is reasonably priced and packs a punch when it comes to flavor. Me and my husband ordered the lamb gyro...DELICIOUS! I would have loved to see a spicy version of this but I noticed that they had hot sauce on their kitchen window so I guess I could have easily added it to mine but to be honest....it was delicious without. My father in law ordered the feta burger.... mmmm mmmm! All dishes come with feta fries or a small salad... it was really interesting to see and have the feta fries...cause surprisingly it was so tasty! They also have a little corner soup bar! It was cute and also yummy. Over all this place on food was amazing. The only thing I have to say is that it took a little longer than I would have thought to get our food but over all, amazing job to the owner, the cook for great food and the sweet girl behind the counter for great customer service! I WILL BE coming back here! And I will total recommend this place as a must eat!"}
{"text":"great gyro, free soups, everything is fresh and good everytime. my kids love the free soup and its what separates them from the rest of the gyro places in the valley"}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to go try Greek Gyro Express for lunch today. Went in and they were a little busy. We walked to the counter, they do not have a menu posted on the wall, just pics only a few selections. I found the to go menu on the counter, so pick it up found a few more selections. As we were deciding the order, the owner (I think) came out with a few samples of the gyro meat and told us to try. WOW, it is was good... Very good!   I ordered the chicken pita meal (chicken gyro with onions, tomatoes, and Tzatziki; included Greek fries and a drink). My brother ordered the combo two meat plate (gyro, chicken, salad, tomatoes, onion and a drink). As we sat, the owner came out and told us to try the complementary soup (lemon, chicken and rice). I got two small bowls so we could try it. You know what? It was pretty good. I likie!   The good came out looking just like the pictures on the wall. My chicken pita was very tasty and the Greek fries (fries with feta cheese) good. Everything was very good. My brothers plate looked good too. He inhaled it, so I am assuming he liked it. =)   Next time, I think I might try the gyro pita."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for 4 years. service is absolutely amazing and the food is amazing as well. I go at least once a week. The place is clean and the prices are reasonable as well. Just fyi they are closed on sundays and they usually close a bit earlier on holidays. I LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"I love gyros and this place delivered my cravings. We were on a long road trip and stumbled upon this place. The portions were big. The meat was juicy."}
{"text":"I certainly found a new fast food go to. Im not a 'fast food' kinda gal but I will partake once in awhile.  The free soup was good. Lemon chicken w rice. My gyro was excellent.  The best part was I got to trade out the fries for a salad. Which was fresh and so yummy!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing! People here are friendly with great customer service. Love the chicken soup on the side!! One my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the years. And, tbh, I usually get the Gyro sandwich combo, which I really like. Both the \"sandwich\" and the Greek fries have always been hot. The soup is really good, too.  The staff is polite and courteous.  On my last visit, I goofed and ordered the Gyro plate (basically, all the fixen's for a Gyro separated onto a plate). While the tomatoes were under-ripe, they still tasted pretty good. The meat seemed a bit dry, but was actually quite tender and tasty.  Overall, a really good meal. Gonna have to try some of their other dishes.  However, sometimes, the floor gets a bit dirty (especially with straw wrappers and tips). And, the tables are not always cleaned off in a timely manner (on one of my visits, 3 tables were dirty upon my arrival. And, still not cleaned when I left 30 minutes later)."}
{"text":"I go here once a week...it's the best...gyros are always good and the staff is pretty friendly...free soup while you wait!!"}
{"text":"The wait was really long for dinner. I got the falafel plate and the hummus was overly salty and more of an applesauce consistency than a hummus spread. The flavor wasn't great. they were out of the spinach pie. The falafel was really dark and super spiced. Too strong of a favor for me. The salad was the highlight of the meal but not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Great food  Friendly Staff.  Very reasonable prices...less than $20 for lunch for 2.  FREE SOUP while you wait for your order.   My wife and I have eaten there about 5 times, and now i start chanting \"BAKLAVA! BAKLAVA!\" as soon as we walk in the door to distract her while ordering:)"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The guy behind the counter was so friendly and helpful!! I ordered the skewers and my husband had the gyro. Both were made to order and the meat was juicy fresh. The sauce was yummy too. Good place to go for a good bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business and amazing food. I enjoy the meals and complimentary soup."}
{"text":"Found this place in the Entertainment Book \"buy one get one deal.\" Been there several times since we found it. It is always fresh and fast, friendly service....a good lunch spot. Free chicken rice or lentil soup is perfect addition. A nice family run place. I would definitely eat there again for my Gyros fix for sure...only down side sandwich a little small, but love the feta cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Let me just say -- YUM!!  This was my choice on Valentine's Day (I know -- WHAT?! -- but we celebrate V-Day EVERY DAY of the year, it's just another day to take your $$).    Anyway, they offer FREE fresh, homemade soup while you're waiting for your meal (Lentil or Chicken Lemon Rice), so we tried one of each.  Delicious!  I ordered the Gyro Pita and Greek Fries and my husband ordered the Gyro Combo Plate (Gyro meat and Chicken Souvlaki).  The plates came and his platter was enormous, covered with meat and rice and pita, and my pita was STUFFED with the best gyro meat I've ever had.  Not too salty, but very flavorful.  The fries were lightly sprinkled with feta cheese, and they gave an extra side of tzatziki on the side.  I could only eat half of the sandwich, it was so much food!  Needless to say, I was a very happy girl!  Try it, it's delicious food with great prices and a very friendly staff.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Alway a very good lunch...make sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal!  Opa!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on positive Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! Contrary to my usual experience with Greek food, the food here is not overly greasy/oily, and is fresh. The soup that came with my meal was AWESOME especially on a rainy day. My only two issues are that it was a little more expensive than I would normally like to pay for lunch but the quality and amount of food was on par with the price. The other issue (more of a preference really) is that my Greek fries did not come with sauce on them. Only the feta cheese. Other than that this place was awesome. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice atmosphere and is not hard to spot in the shopping center. Service was kind and polite. The meat was a little dry in my chicken gyro but the prices seemed fair for the amount of food you recieve. Thier deserts were absolutely scrumptious!"}
{"text":"29 minutes from the time on the receipt to when the first plate was placed on my table.....food tastes good but not 29 minutes good....also for the speed of service it was slightly overpriced...as long as there is no other competition this is the place to go for Greek food"}
{"text":"28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word \"Express\" from your signage."}
{"text":"I am giving them 5 for food and 5 for friendliness. Really nice people and really good food.   John Stamos would approve of this place if he ever stopped selling yogurt long enough.   I ordered ba ba soulvlaki also known as lamb skewers with a Greek salad. Oh if Bo peep could have known the wonderful taste that fairy tale would have turned out different.   And to top it  all off little baby cannolis.   You know a place is good when you see 3 different people walk in and they are greater with welcome back your ussual."}
{"text":"I don't like to give mediocre reviews but my experience was just that.   We ordered to-go & received our food in a timely manner, so that was nice. However, the gyro salad I ordered was underwhelming & lacked seasoning. I LOVE tzatziki sauce & was disappointed in the consistency & flavor.   On the plus side, the pita bread was warm & enjoyable. On another down side, we ordered baklava & were sad to see that it did not make it in our bag although we were charged. Too bad--it looked pretty good! The staff was friendly enough as well but, overall, the experience was a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Service is always slow but the food is super good.  Trust me I've tried a lot of Greek places and this is by far the best flavor and value.  Their combos come with \"Greek Fries\" which is just feta but it adds to the whole meal.  They also have free soups in the eating area!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with what has become of this restaurant. service is very poor, food was dried out and french fries were cold and when I asked if they could be exchanged it,  just the Fries I got attitude by the cook.. No apologies just that  the hostess said I'll bring it out to you !!I had to wait another 10  extra minutes for my food when it should of been a Quick adjustment! Highly not recommended!!!!!! Probably will never spend another dime there"}
{"text":"Came here today with my fiancé. Had the Mediterranean Trout sandwich..... Ohhhhh myyyy goshhhh! So fresh and delicious. My fiancé had a bite and said the same. Its right off the grill so it takes a little longer than other dishes. We had somewhere to go but decided to wait the 10-15 minutes it took as the guy at the register assured us it was worth the wait. Definitely worth it. Very friendly customer service. Fiancé had the hummus platter and added chicken. That was pretty good as well. Pita was fresh and you could tell they make the hummus in shop. Anywho, great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This little place is awesome! The Gyro combo is what I had and it was delicious.  The service.....what can I say Theodore totally rocks this place, he is all about customer service and satisfaction.  Everything is fresh and tasty so if you haven't tried this place you need to!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great place! They were particularly busy with big to-go orders when we visited and were very gracious.  Theodore was awesome.  Food was tasty, fresh and hearty.    We were just passing through, but we'll stop next time we pass through town. :). Back again and friendly and delicious just as last time!  Happy family!"}
{"text":"Friendly customer service, great tasting food, and healthy portions. Especially love the Lentil soup!!"}
{"text":"Looove this place ! My son loves the spinach spanko pita, there is always a free home made soup available, gyro is the way I remeber it from Europe, and the service is GREAT !"}
{"text":"I haven't written a review here in over 2 years, so decided to update my previous ones.    I still order the same thing every time we visit...gyro combo.  I can't seem to stray from it.  And, each time, hubby and I still look at each other and smile when we take those first few bites.    We love this place!"}
{"text":"Been here a ton of times, if I had to guess probably like 30. The food is always fresh and delicious, but the thing that really keeps me coming back is the friendly service. The guys who run the front are always so professional and genuinely nice. I'm happy to support their restaurant as a regular. A lot of restaurants could learn a thing or two about customer service from them!"}
{"text":"The gyros are tender and yummy. The cashier/ server is friendly. The soup is free and help-your-self.  The atmosphere is fine but tattered up a bit."}
{"text":"Hot cheese soup! Place was ok. Nothing to complain about. Clean, very nice staff. I got the Gyro, and salad. I don't eat carbs, so I tossed the pita and chowed down on the meats and veggies. Filled me up. Broke camp, mission complete.  I'm used to Pita Kitchen, but thought I'd give this joint a try since it's a mile away. I'd be returning for sure. Good prices."}
{"text":"7 bucks for a gyro combo...cant beat that! comes with large sandwich, feta fries, a drink and free soup! Friendly staff i walked in at 9 pm immediately greeted by a young guy who im guessing was running it. Very tasty very filling and the feta cheese is just next level so bomb!"}
{"text":"Oh my! For the price, this is easily the best Greek food I've had in the Valley. The gyros are authentic, Chicago-style and the portions are hearty. The Greek salad with charbroiled chicken was delicious and fresh and I just loved the free lemon chicken rice soup. Nice touch that they remembered who we were and brought us our food - no need to listen for your number or hang onto your receipt. Kinda weird there was not a garbage can in sight (not in a bad way - who wants to eat near a trash can?) so we left our \"real\" dishes on the table to be cleaned up by the staff. I only wish this place was closer to home. They do have a TV but when we were there, it was playing a travel-related program about the different sites and cities in Greece. I'm not sure if they even have the means to put on a sporting event but I wasn't there to watch TV. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"BEST GYRO SANDWICH IN TOWN!!! This place has ruined gyros anywhere else for me now. If I'm the mood for a gyro no one else will do. Love both the lentil bean and lemon chicken w/ rice soups that are offered for free while you wait."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is amazing and they give you complimentary soup! I also like that they play Greek history on the tv to keep it traditional."}
{"text":"Every single time we've been here, we've left satisfied! The food is delicious and the staff if friendly. They have soup while you wait, if you haven't tried it, you must!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am satisfied walking out the door. The soups (especially the lentil bean, my favorite.) are outstanding and they come with the meal. I can not tell you how good the spinach pie is; listed as Spanakopita on the menu. Great service and a calm atmosphere. Very delightful."}
{"text":"Great Gyros and baklava!  Order ahead because it's not what you would call \"fast\" food. Definitely worth the wait though. Really nice guy at the counter.  Free soup is good too!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I've been to this place I think six times total... And the first five times I had the gyro sandwich and Greek fries. They were pretty darned good too. The quality of the fries is super random though. They are sometimes old and stale.... Today I ordered the Falafel sandwich and Greek fries. It was a Greek tragedy! The worst fries I've ever had...stale and cold. I took my food home but I live under five minutes from the restaurant and they were in a take out box so there was no reason for them to be ice cold. And the falafel tasted like it was made from some dry mix or something the insides were almost as brown as the outside there was nothing fresh about my meal in any way. Even the lettuce was wilted. So disappointed. I would still consider grabbing a gyro at some point maybe. Bur at this point I'm just looking for a new Greek place."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I eat here several times a week. My entire office is addicted. We order ahead and our order is always ready to go when promised. The food is affordable and delicious. This is the best Greek restaurant in AZ hands down. The free lentil soup with your order is delicious. The cherry on top of it all is the excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Free homemade soup!  I had the lemon chicken rice soup. Very hearty, chunks of celery, and carrot, flavorful broth, tender, but not overcooked rice. Delicious!  For my meal I had the classic gyro combo. Generous amount of meat, decent amount of tzatziki, soft and warm pita, chunks of tomato and onion.  Delicious! Would return!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times and have never received this free soup. The first time I went I was impressed with the service and the food, but since then, the food is pretty good but the service is bad. The girl who is at the counter most of the time is very short with customers and at times I've even felt like she doesn't want customers there at all. I love Greek food, but I doubt I'll be going back often since I feel like a burden every time I walk in."}
{"text":"I was here last night to pick up an order. The young men running the store were incredible! These guys are great for business. Very friendly and professional. I messed up on my order when I called it in, and they took care of it. Great food...ok...I've eaten here on other occasions, but last night was by far the best all around experience. The Gyro sandwiches were stuffed full of meat! Love the food! Love the service! Love the professionalism from the workers last night! I'm a customer for life! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, exceptional service. This is a great family run restaurant and the food is really good - especially given the inexpensive price!"}
{"text":"Love it, try the gyro salad! Also the gyro sandwich. Oh yea and the pita with zatziki(spelling?) is awesome. Love it every time"}
{"text":"I had actually never had Greek food before I moved to Arizona in 2006.  Since then, I have fallen in love.  Typically, I eat at Athenian Express in downtown Phoenix, as it is near where I work and I go with coworkers.  This last week, I wanted to get my wife to try Greek, so I took her here with the kids.  I like Athenian, and this place is better!  The meat is piled on the Gyro, and the fries are great.  Feta is an add-on for $.50, but well worth it.  Overall, you just can't go wrong!  Plus, as an appetizer, they have a pot of soup sitting there for you to help yourself too while you wait for your food to get done.  For free!  The only negative we had was my son had the spaghetti, and he didn't really like it.  It didn't have any sauce like normal Italian-style spaghetti, and it had a cinnamon flavor to the meat.  I don't know if this is a traditional Greek thing.  I thought it was still pretty good, but he didn't like it."}
{"text":"Best greek resturant in the west valley!!! All around 5 stars! Food is always served in less than 10 minutes, convienent hours, the staff is incredible, affordable prices and the baklava is to die for!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great family owned authentic Greek place! Best I've had in AZ so far. The kids grilled cheese is SO good too, comes on pita bread. YUM!"}
{"text":"The gyros are pretty good.  Flavorful meat, good sauce, fluffy pita. BUT everything else we had was below mediocre.  My wife had the falafel plate.  It was the worst tasting, hockey puck-like, prepackaged and over fried piece of \"food\" I have ever seen, the dog couldn't even choke it down.  Also, don't waste your time or money on the hummus, the local grocery store sells better ones."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago. The gyros are excellent, packed with juicy meat. The fries with Feta are super yummy and the lentil soup is really tasty too. Every once in a while, I think they are trying to get rid of some tzatziki sauce because they put so much on the gyro. Nice problem to have though.  If I had a complaint, it would be that it is sometimes a little too warm in the place. But overall, an excellent experience."}
{"text":"My mom loves coming here. I haven't been here in years and I just came in a few days ago for lunch. It was actually still really good and I like the self serve soups. Yum! I ordered the gyro combo with fries and extra cottage cheese."}
{"text":"Friendly service & great food, free soup."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service, fabulous food & friendly people. The dressing they use on their salad is phenomenal! Definitely my go to Greek restaurant for a quick, wonderful service."}
{"text":"Wonderful chicken shwarma type sandwiches and the cannoli was awesome. Friendly service, free soup (try the lentil), fair prices. I really liked it."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in the area dropping off our Uncle at the nearby Quality Inn. He gave us 15 dollars for food. I checked Yelp to see what was available and saw this highly rated restaurant with a $ indicating a menu under 10 dollars. Gave it a shot and WOW!  Yep everything here is under 10 dollars but the quality tastes twice as expensive. I got the Mediterranean Fish sandwich and my sister had the Lamb souvlaki. The demure hostess politely warned us that these orders would take a while, but honestly it really didn't feel like it took much time at all.  Food was superb, can't believe we got such a great meal for the two of us for only 17 dollars. Plus, they have FREE SOUP that you can help yourself to while you wait. Two kinds even! Chicken lemon rice and Lentil Bean soup. Both very tasty. I'm only sad that this was just a one time deal and I'm likely to never pass this way again anytime soon.  + Great food for astoundingly low price. -This place isn't close to where I live. -Minor gripe. The one TV they have is TINY. I liked the Greek scenery footage they were playing, but I had to squint to make out any detail. Could really use either more TVs set up around the place or one big TV."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I am from the Chicago area and could not find a good Gyro in AZ until I went here.  I go back all the time and got my co-workers hooked also.  5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have eaten here several times. My favorite place for great Greek food. Wish I could give them five stars but the food is always a very long wait. Every time! I have never been here and found myself surprised that the food came out quick. Always slow but friendly service. They would so themselves a huge favor to fix this one major problem!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! If i could give more stars i would. Tzatziki sauce is the best. Customer service is welcoming."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to have lunch! They have the best soup, gyros & chicken souvlaki I've found in all of Arizona!! Family owned and excellent customer service too!! You need to try this place, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"This gets a five star for sure! We were passing from California to Texas and found this on yelp. The food was fresh, flavorful, delicious, and free soup! The baklava was to die for! Service was fabulous"}
{"text":"PS Rob T, I am Sicilian from NYC so you damned well better believe that I can judge a Cannolli from behind glass. Problem with people who have not grown up with Italian desserts is that they think these nasty little excuses for Cannolli at Greek gyro express are actually good!!! Oh and yeah, u really have nothing better to do than make a dumb statement on Yelp when someone posts an opinion that differs from yours??  Grow up."}
{"text":"Very good food and staff, you should definitely eat here if you are looking for great greek food to hit the spot."}
{"text":"I had a Gyro Pita Combo for lunch today and it was excellent.   While waiting I had a cup of their free lentil soup which proved to be a perfect start. The pita was generous an tasty.  The fries were fresh and served with feta. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"A Greek restaurant, run by real Greek owners is a receipt for success. The food was perfectly prepared, and tasty. The complimentary homemade soups available, while the order is prepared, is a nice touch. The high def TV showing a tour of the Greek Isles should be much bigger, but it is a great addition to the dining area. The decor is pleasant with photos and paintings showcasing Greece make it very inviting. If you are tired of the same old food fair in Arizona, stop by this little family run establishment. With the friendly staff, the delicious food, and the relaxed atmosphere, you will leave with a smile on your face. It's as good as it gets. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro sandwich, that was very appetizing. Also, I love both free soups. They are delicious, I like adding touch of sriracha."}
{"text":"Love this place,i am greek and this is the most authentic food I could find around here ,very friendly, clean and the complimentary soups are amazing ,thank you gyro Express for the delish suwlaki and gyros"}
{"text":"Loves this place, went there for lunch after class and had their lunch special which was a gryo pita with a drink. Their gyro was on point, moist and sliced with perfection. Their protions are huge that i couldn't even finish it. This place is great for families. Very open and very friendly."}
{"text":"After a video from The Jimmy Fallon Show about how to pronounce Gyro went viral, getting one of those lamb and other meaty goodness things in my mouth was paramount. This place took care of all my needs better than I could have hoped. Friendly staff, fresh food, amazing baklava. Will be a regular."}
