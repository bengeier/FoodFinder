{"text":"Great service until you want to leave, the server forgets you. Frustrating when you have a plane to catch. Great food for an airport. Great drink/beer menu."}
{"text":"Mediocre overpriced airport food I can handle. But this place seems designed to fail thanks to poor communication between server, kitchen, cashier and management. We ordered something simple off the menu. Both orders arrived wrong. One inedible. Beverage wrong. Server offered an unspecified discount as a result, which eventually didnt come either. It was like they were not set up to deliver the basics of what every other restaurant strives for: listen to what the customer orders and give it to them."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food but terrible service, the waitresses are rude, obnoxious and annoying. They don't have any sense of hospitality or just basic mannerisms. My waitress kept coming over to my table every three minutes and was rude enough to tell me \"don't call me.,, I have other customers as well\" this is so disrespectful and I am not paying to get attitude from a waitress when I am dealing with delayed flights!! I strongly suggest you fix your attitude"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at this place. Everything was fine until I pulled half a toothpick out of the sandwich I was eating. The half-toothpick was in my mouth at the time. I informed the bartender who clearly didn't care at all. She didn't even comp me the sandwich or apologize. Maybe this is par for the course at this place."}
{"text":"I asked about maybe turn one of their 9 TVs to the tennis channel, but was told they do not know what French open is, this is the first day of game, :-("}
{"text":"First thing, start the vacation off right and have breakfast. I ordered the California eggs Benny and my wife had the Egg and bacon sandwich. The Benny was good and the hollandaise sauce was abundant. My wife had lettuce on her sandwich and it had wilted and gone bad, we mentioned it to our waitress. She apologizes and talked to the manager and had it taken off our bill. Small mistake but they made up for it"}
{"text":"5 star customer service excellence by Jamie from Barrie! Great spot for food and drinks if you're waiting for a flight to the US. Great selection of beer in bottle and on tap. AAA Alberta sirloin with root veg and mash recommended! Will come back next time I'm heading home to Halifax. Check it!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff on my lunch stop there before my long flight home. Both of the people who were working the bar took good car to make sure that all of my needs were met."}
{"text":"Maybe I was hungry when I came here. So I was flying out from YYC airport to the USA and due to the flight delay, I can take no more. I was hungry. I didn't want to have food court junk. So I wanted a sit down place and decided to choose this restaurant (there are only two sit down restaurants). Looks like good selections of beer. I wanted something to munch on and so I got the wings. Salt and pepper. I am surprised that they didn't over salt or peppered the wings. Love that fact. Even though it was over cooked but it tasted really good with the ranch sauce. Not sure why.   Place is super busy. But I enjoyed the food here and the relaxation of sitting here. Food came quick."}
{"text":"Nice new place in the E terminal. They have a wonderful selection of beers on tap. It's a little pricey, but what can you expect at an airport?"}
{"text":"So I'm not rating the beer or dinner as i only had breakfast.  Let's start with service.   My server was nice, but not really genuine. She would ask if everything was ok, but was walking away before you answer.  Service was ok and i would have given 3 stars, except for the food.   Everything was not ok.  I had the big Belgian breakfast.  The sausage flavor was very off putting.  Like a cheap hot dog.  Only had one bite.  The bacon was too limp...didn't try it.  Eggs were under-cooked, but was hungry so ate them.  The fries potatoes had a seasoning that was not wanted and was not good. They might be able to serve them without the seasoning...but had no idea as it wasn't mentioned on the menu. I couldn't eat them.  The toast was fine.   I'm always curious what a server thinks when they remove your plate and realize you've hardly touched anything.   I'm sure they realize you didn't like it.  But i believe they don't want to ask...and that's ok with me.  I didn't care about the price....but I'm a much more informed customer.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Was surprised how good this \"airport\" food was. Great music and service as well. We were served fairly fast and had a very nice waitress. Enjoyed our time here while we waited for our flight."}
