{"text":"Fantastic food.  The Chinese here is some if the best in the region and amazing fresh all made to order not pre cooked like most places."}
{"text":"The food here isn't anything close to the Thai food I'm familiar with. If you fancy a semi decent Thai dinner, take the extra time and drive somewhere else. A takeout place in a supermarket? No thanks."}
{"text":"DON'T DO IT!!  Absolutely disgusting! Seeing the other reviews, I gave it a shot..  I ordered a Chicken Basil dish, which tasted nothing like my favorite Thai dish.. Instead, I got a few pieces of sliced chicken, one slice of red pepper,  and loads of onions SWIMMING in a brown greasy, oily tasteless substance that masqueraded as sauce.  They don't deserve a dime for the slop I just ate.  Gruel in a North Korean prison camp could not have been much worse."}
{"text":"For a \"hole in the wall of a Harris Teeter\" restaurant this place is amazing.  We had been searching for a good Chinese restaurant for the last 8 years in South Charlotte.   Finally found it.  Who would have thought to look inside Harris Teeter?   Had some Thai veggie soup, Lo Mein, Pad Thai, Sesame Chicken and eggrolls.  Everything was very good, some of it was great.  Portions are about twice the size of most take out places.  Chinese was best I've had in Charlotte.   The Thai was very good, but you can find better, but probably not from a takeout place!   We will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but nothing special when it comes to Chinese take-out. I will say there are other places nearby that are much better. The portions are pretty small, and sauces are bland. The owners are usually pretty nice when I go. The only reason I will come here is really for the convenience factor of it being in Harris Teeter. Other than that, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"As described by a previous reviewer, this great \"take-out\" restaurant is inside the Harris-Teeter @ the Arboretum Shopping Ctr. Having lived in San Francisco for four years, our family is pretty picky about the quality of Asian cuisine, and this is about as good as you're going to get in Charlotte.    I carry a take out menu in my car, and to save time I call ahead and order. I'm always greeted with a smile, my order is always accurate, consistently tastes great, and large portions are reasonably priced. My kids favorites are the pan-fried dumplings, BBQ spareribs, orange chicken and orange beef. The pad thai is good, but lacks the sharp peanut flavor I've had at other restaurants. Great take out choice for party of one or ten, as long as you don't have to cook!"}
{"text":"Ok a Chinese restaurant in a Harris Teeter? Although weird, man is this takeout good! Good quality and the sauces have so much flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place it is my go to Thai food restaurant. The owner is so nice and they make the food fast and perfect for night in dinner. I always get the Pad Thai and the Kang Dang curry with white rice. They give you good portions too so its a perfect lunch or dinner for the next day too.  It's right inside Harris Teeter as soon as you walk in so it's super convenient."}
{"text":"I love the staff at Chi Thai! The owners are always there working hard with there employees! The food is fantastic... try the Mongolian Beef! The friends and family that I've recommended this place to says they are the nicest people they've ever encountered... and I thought they were only that nice to me! Seriously stop in and get some food from this place ... oh it's carry out only and inside of Harris Teeter just behind Starbucks."}
{"text":"It's been almost 4 years since my last review, even though I stop by pretty frequently. I'm compelled to reaffirm my positive review since there are some one-star complaints now posted. Food is fresh, piping hot, and generously apportioned. My photo of the spicy Thai dish Pad Pak with tofu shows a container filled past its rim with fresh cilantro, snow peas, water chestnuts, green peppers, carrots, onions, baby corn, broccoli, and mushrooms. Yum! $10.65 includes tax."}
{"text":"After the raving reviews of this hole in the wall of Harris Teeter, I had to check it out.   It was nothing of the sorts for me. I got the vegetarian Tom Kha soup and a bag of crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were definitely not fresh and I had requested that the soup be made with only certain vegetables and it came with a slew of others I'm not favorable about.  I've had this kind of soup in Atlanta, and it's to die for! This one, not so much. Didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Go here for all my Chinese food! It is a little pricey for takeout but the potstickers are amazing, lo mein is always good and shrimp and broccoli. The owners are great and friendly!"}
{"text":"ONLY place I will eat take out Chinese/Thai! We get take out several times a month.The food is Always good and fresh."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked in the HT at Arboretum beside the Starbucks. It  has been around for a long time, but they are still churning out some really good quality take-out.    The owner and his wife are very friendly and always have a smile and time for a little chit-chat.   We usually call ahead and the food is always fresh, hot, and ready to go. The portion sizes are good and there is usually enough to take the leftovers to lunch the next day.  I sometimes place an order for take out while I am shopping and they get the food prepared pretty quickly.  They have great Chinese and Thai dishes!"}
{"text":"Enjoy their shrimp lo mein anytime I go into the Harris Teeter. Good quality and quantity at a fair price!"}
{"text":"This little take away counter is overlooked  and some people might not even know it exist, but I can't even walk into this Harris Teeter without some hot red curry coming home with me.  It's also really reasonable. There are a few tables if you want to sit inside of the HT."}
{"text":"After intermittent shopping at the Harris Teeter in which Chi Thai is located, and reading a few other reviews, the time was nigh to check out the grub! Located to the right upon entering HT, Chi Thai is a small takeout counter with tons of options. A great marriage of Chinese and Thai dishes with tons of great sides.   We came in for a late lunch and ordered two lunch specials and two soups. Only took about 15 minutes as they prepared everything fresh. I ordered the Thai Kew Teaw which was grilled noodles, chicken, peppers, grilled onions, and a heavenly sriracha-esque sauce. Reminded me a lot of many other Thai dishes I've ordered with the smoky flavor of the noodles and the grilled, crispy veggies. My wife ordered a veggie noodle dish. Loved the thick lo mein noodles. The sauce they were tossed in was very mild and simple.   The soups were great. Egg drop and hot & sour. The hot and sour was very thick and a little more on the sour side. Also, it had pork in it which is a little different. Not a bad addition. The eggdrop was very good. Thick and creamy, with tons of great egg  flavor.   Lunch for the two of us was less than $20 and were super full. We didn't even eat dinner that night!  Next time we're shopping at HT on 51, Chi Thai will be an easy choice for quick takeout."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and have been looking for good chinese delivery or takeout. The food was so delicious and fresh I don't even mind they don't deliver. I ordered general Tso chicken, chicken wings and egg rolls. The prices were a bit high but certainly worth it an portions so big I will probably get 5 meals out of it. Chicken was spicy, and came with broccoli and white rice. All we're cooked perfectly. Wings were crispy. Egg rolls were a bit different but still delicious. Definitely, definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a year now. Finally, after getting home from a trip and not wanting to go too far, we decided to check Chi Thai out. We ordered and were told it would be about 15 minutes. We killed some time by buying some groceries. My wife and I both got the Pad Thai with Beef. The price surprised me as a little expensive ($9.95) but that was before I realized how much it was. I ate Pad Thai for three straight meals. So it's actually a pretty  good deal. It is much better than the other thai place we tried. I will look forward to going back and trying more."}
{"text":"Do not trust the reviews. Worst Thai food I've ever had! We ordered three dishes: Tom Kha Gai, pad kee mow, and chicken fried rice. None of them had any flavor or spice. The pad kee mow didn't even taste like what it's supposed to!"}
{"text":"Best in Charlotte! Excellent sauces, freshest ingredients, amazing food! Five Star!!!!"}
{"text":"Me Li and his food are awesome.  His fake out is better than most dine in Chinese restaurants.  Always reliable always good!  Keep it up"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, ok cost, fresh ingredients, good portions too (we always have left overs).  I always get the special - a mix of seasonal veg + shrimp, chicken and beef.  Pot stickers are the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Precooked noodles in Ragu like sauce.  I got the Thai food (Phod Thai).  Don't do it!  There was a sprinkling of vegetables and not much else.  I asked for extra lime and onion and they gave me a tiny end of a lemon (not a lime) and no extra onions."}
{"text":"One day I decided to eat here for lunch and it was a great decision! The food is amazing! The Sa Cha shrimp, shrimp and broccoli and broccoli and garlic sauce are the dishes I have tried so far and they are amazing! Since I go around lunch time I get a lunch special , so the pricing is reasonable and you get a really nice portion of food, always leaves me full! The staff are friendly and they smile a lot. I always try to leave a tip for them because I appreciate them being so nice! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some really good Chinese/Thia food to eat!"}
{"text":"Solid, handy option if you happen to live in the neighborhood or need to food shop and grab dinner at the same time.   We ordered a cross-section of the thai and chinese menu options and our overall impression is that the ingredients are fresh and the portions GIANT! They literally give you enough for multiple meals. Not necessarily the most inventive preparation, but solid overall.  Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Had a simple order  of chicken wings...too much batter..wings too large...all I taste was burn...I might go back but I will never have the wings"}
{"text":"This place is spot on.  Hands down, probably the best chinese/asian food in Charlotte.   I know it might seem odd to get some Asian food from inside the Harris Teeter, but do not be deceived, this place will not disappoint.   I usually go with the Pad Prak Pow, tons of veggies, GREAT sauce and the portion size is big enough for me and my wife to share with a little extra left over, all for $12.   Other dishes are very typical of what you may think, (Egg rolls, spring rolls, crab ran goons,)  Some reviews complain that it's not traditional Thai food, and I will concede that I wouldn't consider this Thai as well, so with that being said, ignore that and focus on this place as your new take out Chinese joint.   They are consistent and timely with every order.  No complaints at all."}
{"text":"I'm not giving my money away anymore!  My biggest complaint there is no sauce like it used be.  I have requested extra sauce in sweet n sour/orange chicken dinner plates.  My request was totally ignored!  Ever since then owner (gentleman) always taking orders seems upset with me.  I have given them many chances.  It's not tasty to eat PLAIN dry RICE! My last order rice was mushy and old.  Usually chicken is overcooked too."}
{"text":"Hidden away next to the flower section and Starbucks at Harris Teeter lies this little Chinese-Thai gem. The owners are very friendly and the food is just as good as any authentic Chinese/Thai takeout place.  Sesame beef and Lo Mein is a favorite of ours. You can place your order to go before you do your grocery shopping, then pick it up when  you are done.  Convenient!!"}
{"text":"I tried this take out restaurant tonight based on the recommendation of a coworker. My boyfriend has been searching for quality Chinese food in the area. Chi Thai definitely delivers, serving up large portions of Chinese and Thai. We placed our order in the store and it was prepared in 10 minutes. Great location in Harris Teeter with friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"O M G!!! What a gem had I not read the yelp reviews, I would've passed this place by like a in house fast food joint.. boy would that have been an incorrect assumption! Flavor and freshness! Great customer service and interaction when they even bowed to my request of changing the type of curry I wanted in my dish! I ordered the vegetarian Kang Dang. On the menu it is described as, \"Thai red curry in coconut cream sauce with cabbage, tofu, straw mushrooms, onions, red peppers, asparagus, green peppers and bamboo shoots\".. but they willingly changed it per my request to yellow curry at no extra charge or major fuss. :D  After they obliged, I decided to also order the vegetarian Tom Kha, a Thai coconut cream soup with galangal and lemon grass, lemon leaf, tomato and straw mushroom. Since I got it veggie instead of meat, it also had peppers, onions, celery, broccoli and a slew of other welcoming and tasteful vegetables. Both dishes were surprisingly wonderful. I will gladly return, try other items, and suggest this eatery (there is a seating area behind the flowers, next to the Starbucks) to others! Happy eating!  ..and just to add their prices are high, but they are in point for quality.. and the owners/cooks are quite friendly."}
