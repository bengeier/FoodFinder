{"text":"The food is consistently good whether we dine in or carry out. This is one of those local gems, food-wise.  I've been to many Italian restaurants throughout the country and this is up there as far as food quality. That being said, I do have 2  complaints.

1. They don't open until 2pm, so during the week this just isn't a lunch option. The hours (at this time) are listed on yelp incorrectly and I have notified yelp. Check their website for correct hours. 

2. Service - rarely service with a smile. Sometimes we get the impression that we are an annoyance and all though we may crave their food, dining there isn't exactly a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"nasty pizza. no taste  nothing special. would rather have a frozen pizza way better then then what they call pizza. nasty stuff"}
{"text":"I have to get a meal from Lenocis once a week! Their food is so incredible. Everything has so much flavor. I only do take out but the staff is always nice when I go to pick it up. If you like Italian food, Lenocis will make you fall in love with it. Thank you Lenocis for making the best Italian food!"}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem. Not much on the outside. The inside is pretty small and simple. The food is out of this world. 

I had cheese ravioli with Bolognese. There were 6 good sized ravioli done perfectly. The sauce was thick with more than enough meat. It was perfectly seasoned and slightly sweet. 

My husband had linguini with white clam sauce. Lots of clams and beautifully seasoned. Linguini was al dente and the serving size was more than adequate.

I was very impressed with the house Italian bread served with the meals. It had a great taste and was warm with a nice crunchy crust. In fact I was so impressed I ordered a loaf to go to eat later with my left over ravioli.      

I would highly recommend this restaurant. I know we will return"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a trip down memory lane.  It could easily have looked and felt the same 40 years ago as it does today.  The eggplant parmigiana came with spaghetti and tomato sauce (that is, I chose spaghetti and tomato sauce as my pasta), and the sauce turned out to be perfect for those who dislike flavor.  My meal ended up being not small enough for me to \"join the clean plate club.\"  If I'm ever here again (unlikely, alas), I'll try a meat dish."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant parm and the hubby had ziti with meatballs.  The main course was good, soup was a little greasy but the canoli was terrible. Service was very slow but it was also a full house so I will cut them some slack this time. I'd have given them five stars except for the dessert.  Sprinkles on a canoli?
We will go back."}
{"text":"What a great find today. I was just out for a drive after work and waiting for my hotel to get booked and got hungry so I searched Yelp and found this great Italian restaurant. The staff is very welcoming and courteous. The Chicken Marsala that was prepared for me looked identical to the one pictured 2 years ago. I must add that it may be the best I've had. So if you're in the area and want a no frills and honestly can't miss Italian meal I'm confident that this place will surely please any palette"}
{"text":"This man used to own Rino's when it was real Italian food!!! He wanted to retire but as fait has stepped in and the new owners ruined the Rino's name by changing the quality and taste of the food he was begged by many to come back and give us back real Italian food. While it is a little $$$ it is worth every penny. My mouth waters thinking about the chicken parm. talk about yummy!!!! It you don't leave full that is your own fault portion sizes are on the larger end of reasonable and that is why I say if you aren't full that is your fault!!!"}
{"text":"The service, chicken parmigiano, spinach & artichoke dip and Alfredo were all amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I passed it every day and never had a chance to go in. Today I had that chance. It's small and intimate, my husband and I ordered Calamari (small portioned, rubber taste) not to mention 10 dollars *see pic*, salads which were fine. Hubby had lasagna (said the cheese was chewy, but ok) I had the Chicken Alfredo (bland sauce, cut chicken on top of the pasta but not cut all the way through). Their bread is amazing... don't know if we will be back due to the food and cost. But the service is perfect the waitresses are attentive, but non hovering :-)"}
{"text":"Great food here.  I had the ny style pizza and it was great.  The salad was home style which you never see anywhere."}
{"text":"excellent Italian food. good portions, good service. spaghetti sauce is full of flavor. Pizza is good too"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this little gem scare you away! Once you walk inside everything is amazing! The restaurant is clean, roomy, and has nice music at a comfortable volume. And the food? is nothing less than excellent!! The potato soup was thick and delicious, the salad was fresh and had a great variety of veggies, and the house Italian dressing was perfect! The bread and butter was excellent and our main course was fantastic! I had zucchini parmesan...Yummy!! And my husband had ziti with meatballs... Delicious!! And, to top it all off, the offer creme brulee for dessert!! We will definitely be eating here again!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza tasted like a dumpster fire. Ordered extra cheese and didn't get extra cheese. Called the store and they were rude about it. They basically told me to just buy a store bought pizza next time. I never leave 1 star reviews but this kind of service is absurd. I wouldn't have even left a bad review had they managed the situation like a \"manager\" should. I know things can't always be perfect but when people aren't willing to own their mistakes and at least attempt to provide a better experience in the future then that is when they get 1 star reviews from me. Take this manager's advice, save your money and buy a Digiorno!"}
{"text":"The best N.Y. style pizza around. I am a hard one to please too. Service was quite pleasant. This building has a storied history of serving great pizza from Nick's Pizza World to the present. One can not go wrong with this reataurant."}
{"text":"My first visit here was great! I came as part of a large group and ordered a half-order of spaghetti with blush sauce and OMG is was so tasty and the portion size was just right. I also had a caprese salad, which had a lovely balsamic reduction and large pieces of mozzarella. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the interior, it's quite outdated and the chairs are not comfortable.

Since our visit, we've ordered the takeout New York style pizza and it's delicious, so close to real NY pizza, even our picky kids love it!"}
