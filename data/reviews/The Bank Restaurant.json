{"text":"BR& is one of the most surprsing experiences that I've ever had downtown.  Back in May I had decided to throw my 25th (.....) birthday party.  I had been looking for a great location to host about twenty people and when I walked in BR&'s doors, I knew I had to have my party there.  

As you know, the steak house is located in the former bank and besides adding the tables and a bar, the building is virtually unchanged.  It is was stunning marble from top to bottom.  The first thing you'll notice are the huge ceilings and the beautiful central staircase. 

The way that BR& has been trying to get new customers in the door is with their $20 steak dinner.  It comes with unlimited fries that are absolutely covered in salt, which means that I LOVED them. 

They have a great variety of steak all for about under $30. To be fair, we were expecting really poor quality steaks, especially the $20 ones.  But all of my friends were impressed with the quality of their dinners, they were all very surprised. 

The waitress we had....well, let's just say...she was a tough pill to swallow.  A great server but REALLY intense.   

They have a great private room that overlooks Stephen Ave to the north and the rest of the restaurant on the left.  If you request it, you can even have your own bartender up there. 

It will be interesting to see how BR& works out. Right now, people seem to think it is gimmicky with its cheap steaks.  Maybe that was the wrong move.  Only time will tell."}
{"text":"When I heard The Bank was reopening as a night club (now known as BR&), I was beside myself with excitement. \"Awwwww yeeeeeaaah\" I thought, \"Calgary's bringin' back the old-skool.\"  Even the forces in the universe wouldn't have been able to keep me away from this place, I was *that* excited. Well... that is *until* I actually got there.

Peering in and seeing the place *empty* should have been my first indication that this place was not about to live up to my expectations. I walked in to meet up with a group of people who informed me that the music had been SO bad the last little bit that one of the staff-members finally resorted to plugging in her IPOD, which is what was playing by the time I arrived.

I stayed for a total of 45 minutes and that was 44 minutes too long. The staff was friendly, the decor is as beautiful as ever (the chandeliers held my attention for 44 of the 45 minutes I was there), but the music wasn't good and did I mention the place was EMPTY?!?!?!?

Considering how excited I was for what I thought was  for the revival of *THE* Bank, this night out was an absolute disappointment. 

Here's to hoping that this place picks up. If it doesn't however, I'm callin' this one ahead of time and predicting a re-closure, rather than a revival."}
{"text":"This is an extremely beautiful location, with turn of the century architecture, marble floors, vaulted ceilings, stain glass and enormous chandeliers.  

Right in the heart of Stephan Avenue, I can see how this newly renovated bank could appeal to the corporate masses downtown for lunch. Just entering it is like taking a voyage to another era and place.

The food for me is quite expensive and just so so. Three or four entrees at 19.99 which included steak.   There were salad offerings too but I found that the prawn salad although served in a huge wooden bowl, the lettuce was too plain and white for me.  If you are going to price salads at a higher price, mix it up with an abundant salad green mix and make it look fresh not like it was yellowing in your fridge and you didn't have any lettuce heads to choose from.

The fries were tasty at $3.99"}
