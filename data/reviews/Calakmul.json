{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly service.  We had the chile Verde entree and the soft tacos. Very popular!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!

Great Appetizers, Drinks. Highly recommend the Drunken Chicken Margaritas!!!

Awesome 
Looking forward to going back soon"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food was quite good.
Menu was unreadable. Font needs to be changed. Service was lacking. Staff was very friendly but slow and inattentive. Very, very noisy...hard to converse. Lots of potential but need to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Best Queso Fundido.  Rellenos are great as are fajitas...most tender steak fajitas we have ever had. Everything made from scratch.  Friendly, attentive service."}
{"text":"Interesting spot. Great service. Food, not so much. Portions uneven in size. Some VERY SPICY. Condiments such as sour cream, Guac often not included. Use of cheese is beyond sparing. All in not very interesring and very noisy ...has a long way to go to get me back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit. Good food, good drinks. Good service. Unfortunately not likely able to visit as much as we'd like. For an appetizer and two middle of the road margaritas with tip was $50.00. The margaritas were really good but filled to the brim with ice, decent sized rock glass. Probably a 4 to 5 sip cocktail, maybe a bit steep for 10.00 to 12.00 average. Margarita menu was a bit intimidating but I appreciated the goal. Ended up tasting very good. 
The food was really good, seemingly refined cooking and presentation. Also a bit pricey but not out of hand. Saving up for another visit to do more recon."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food, chicken fajitas and shredded beef tacos (although very small portions for the price) but the service was totally lacking. From the moment we walked in, there were several minutes until we were acknowledged, and once we were seated, another 10 minutes go by before a waiter comes over. Once we finished our meal, upon our exit, we walked right by the hostess stand where the same blonde woman who seated us was and thanked her, which we received no reply. Overall, we will not return because the ambiance of the establishment is very cold and not friendly."}
{"text":"This place was a really good gourmet Mexican place!  I liked there menu, I had Tequila Mahi which was grilled Mahi with a nice tequila cream sauce.  I'm only in town for the night but I would def go back."}
{"text":"We just got back home and we're told about this resturant by neighbors so decided to try it last night. In spite of the excitement of trying a new restaurant it was great food. Tended to be on the spicy side but with great flavors not just excess heat. The Chili Verde was outstanding but be prepared to feel the heat. By the end of the dish your forehead will glisten. The trio of enchiladas were also outstanding. Although we will miss Binkley's in Cave Creek, we will come here often."}
{"text":"Quiet little Mexican food restaurant in the heart of Cave Creek. Restaurant wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. Service however was extremely slow. It took us almost 20 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. Food came out cool to semi warm but was tasty. Price for the food and drinks were reasonable."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place but was disappointed.  Inside is really cute but noise level was deafening.  We could hardly hear each other at our small table making conversation almost impossible.   We all Started with the La Caballera margarita.  It was supposed to have kiwi and jalapeño in it. However it only tasted of pure lime juice and was so sour we couldn't drink it at all. No one could discern kiwi or tequila or jalapeño in the drink at all.   I sent mine back and got a different drink and I am not a picky diner.  I have very rarely sent anything back.  The other diners with me kept theirs but didn't drink them as they were inedible.  

Chips that came to table are very bland and are in desperate need of some salt.  Guacamole was good.  Queso was average.  

Tacos were good but not great.   Mahi mahi taco was dry and in need of a sauce maybe.  

Perhaps it was an off night but I'm not sure there was anything here to make me come back again.  Especially the margarita.  If you can't make a decent margarita that doesn't bode well for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We had dinner here our first night in town. Being from Texas it's always hard to find good Mexican/Latin cuisine.  My husband ordered a pork dish and he loved it.  I had the fajitas and they were so bland and unflavorable.  I wasn't impressed but the hubby loved his.  Our waiter was great. The hostess took forever to greet us and seat us."}
{"text":"Here in the Creek folks are kind with lovely manners. This is just the sort of establishment we deserve. The food as well spiced without being overly salty the staff is amazing; even though there was a bustling Pace I was never left unattended. The salsa has a nice amount of heat and if you want a little more request the Diablo. HIGHLY recommend this for local semi-americanized Mexican fare with flare and great management and service."}
{"text":"First time.  Food was great.  Service excellent  one of the better Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Loved it.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise to find this restaurant; food was very good, the service was outstanding. A good addition to Cave Creek"}
{"text":"Love this place!  My boyfriend and I enjoy grabbing seats next to the heater outside to enjoy our dinner.  Came here on two different occasions.  I ordered Vegetarian Enchiladas the first time.  Our server said the kitchen lost our order and our food was a little delayed but I honestly didn't even notice it.  They were busy that night but in my opinion, it was a normal wait time.  He apologized many times and offered us a free dessert.  Avoiding sweets we declined but that was very nice of them to acknowledge the delay.  The second visit I ordered the Vegetarian Rellenos.  Both dishes we yummy but I prefer the Vegetarian Enchilada.  The chips and salsa are really good!  The chips are fresh and the homemade salsa has the right amount of kick.  Can't wait to go back.  The dessert menu sounds really yummy.  Will need to revisit when our sweet tooth comes back!"}
{"text":"Great new option in the area with better quality than most (if not all) of its nearby competition. Great service and atmosphere! Hard to read some of the fonts on the menu. Would love to see that easier to read!! Otherwise, we will be back! Great job!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome weeknight dinner at Calakmul tonight and I assure you we will be back for many more. The restaurant is new as it just opened about a month ago. The atmosphere is casual but tasteful and the decor and furnishings resemble authentic Aztec-Mexican culture.
The tequila and margarita menu is extensive and our server Nicole was well versed on its offerings. I went with her suggestion and had the house margarita with Herradurra resposado tequila and it was superb. And so was the second one! :) We ordered the queso funelli (spelling?) which was outstanding and plentiful. By all means, get the carne asada! The best I've had. 
All in all, Calakmul is a home run. The food, the service and the ambiance are all top shelf. And if you're lucky enough to get Nicole as your server, ask her advice and follow it. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I started with a Sinaloa (tequila, pineapple purée, coconut purée, lime ... a tasty, summer drink, easy to swill that could get dangerous). Then some very unique guacamole, very tasty, definitely NOT the typical stuff that is made watery with glops of mayonnaise stirred in to take up space. And a big enough bowl of it to serve four. Then camarones a diabla, spicy shrimp with a couple of sides, one of which was an interesting little pasta dish. Pasta? Not your typical Mexican fare ... refreshingly not your typical Mexican fare. My wife had a couple of soft tacos, carne asada, quite good with a couple of sides, one of which was real refried beans (read NOT out of a 50 gallon drum from Refried Beans Are Us). Yes, I am picky about my beans.

Service was friendly, attentive and efficient, thanks to Nicolle who may be a bartender by the time you get there. 

Yes, it is a bit more spendy than your typical beans and rice Mexican restaurant but, hey, Ruth's Chris Is more expensive than Sizzler! Want cheap? Head down the street to El Encanto for a plate the size of a hundred dollar pizza full of refried beans (out of a fifty gallon drum) or better yet head over to the Indian Garden place next to the Hideaway for authentic country Mexican food at even less monies and sit out at the picnic table. It is far better than El Encanto (but there are no ducks to distract the screaming kids whilst you try to have a conversation with your sig other).

Which brings me to the only negative. It is a small restaurant with smooth walls and ceilings so sound reverberates. It could get loud with some boisterous peeps. Especially after they have four Sinaloas!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and little. The restaurant is decorated nicely and is convenient to Cavecreek and the country bars. It is a little different than a normal Mexican restaurant, the cusine is more spanish. They have good tequilas and drinks. I would recommend !"}
{"text":"Husband and I tried this out for the first time tonight. Very small portions for the price. Too spicy for us. General manager was rude at first. Basically said that's just the way it is. Didn't charge for my food but came back after and said to call ahead for mild. Won't be back. Makes sense they are affiliated with because I tried one of theirs and it was way spicy."}
{"text":"New Cave Creek Restaurant!

Pros: great atmosphere, excellent customer service (which means a lot coming from me!), food was good. 

They bring chips and salsa to the table. Looks like they have interesting margaritas. We got the beef fajitas and they were very tasty and came with probably one of the best tortillas I've ever had!

Cons: VERY limited parking. (The parking lot is shared with other businesses) We drove around for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to pull out."}
{"text":"We are here visiting from out of town and wanted a really good Mexican restaurant that offered a more sophisticated menu that was not over the top with \"unique twists\". These ladies and gentlemen hit a home run. 

We split the carne asada tacos and were super pleased. The portions are right sized, not over the top. Great fresh taste and hand made tortillas complimented the meal nicely. 

They are very new, only 2 months, and are well worth a stop. Great staff, very friendly!

Well Done!"}
{"text":"Anytime I hear of a New Mexican  restaurant opening I always wonder if it's going to be the same old cheese smothered yuck. Not the case here.  The restaurant is very pretty and colorful with some cool music in the background. Atmosphere is always important when you decide to go out for dinner so seeing and hearing all of the happy patrons and happy staff just added to the great food and experience!  Staff was attentive but not overly so. Shout out to our server LORI! Thanks for being the best! Our food was terrific. I had the best margarita that had Grand Marnier in it. Yum. Our food was fresh and extremely tasteful. I had the Carne Asada tacos. Generous amount of meat with the best flavor. The tomatillo salsa was spicy and perfect with the tacos. My wife had the fajitas.  Overall it was great and we left there way too full. Will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for dinner which proved unnecessary, as the restaurant was very slow for a Saturday night.  Everything started off right - drinks were delicious (particularly the off-menu recommendation from our server - mango and coconut margarita with a chili rim).  Chips and salsa were tasty, as well. Like other reviewers, I would have liked a little more salt on the chips but they were still quite good. 

The entrees is where the review turns average at best. We had the tequila mahi-mahi as well as the spicy shrimp entrée. Both were edible but not memorable in anyway. My husband upgraded his sides to the elote and tomato pasta - the elote was delicious but the pasta lacked flavor. He would not order (especially at an up charge!) that side again.  The fish was good, but the sauce lacked the depth I would expect with a tequila sauce. It was rather nondescript with no discernible flavor. 

Oddly, the busser tried to clear dishes we were still picking at, making us feel rather hurried. Considering there was no shortage of open tables, we would have expected to be able to linger long enough to finish up our meals.

We frequent this side of town, and hope that the menu improves so we can return to try again."}
{"text":"Great service, really nice staff and great food. It's authentic but fresh Mexican, tends toward spicy side. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!  Service is first class - attentive without being intrusive.  Outstanding food - no Mexican slop (meaning everything isn't drenched in cheese and refried beans). The food is perfect proportions, full of flavor and plated beautifully.  Lovely interior.   A fabulous addition to Carefree/Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  I came here with the whole family for dinner while my mom was visiting from out of town.  I had the Carne Asada, it was a huge dish.  I couldn't finish it, even with my family's help.  My husband had the chili verde pork, he really liked it.  The kids had chicken with and my mom had a burrito.  She expected it to be small, but it was huge. We had the house margaritas and they were great.  For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake, my little boy went in a little to eager and burnt his tongue with the molten lava, it was kind of funny.  We will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a cocktail from a familiar cave creek face (thank you shannon!) Atmosphere and service were top notch. Food menu had lots of fun entrees that I can't wait to try, if it's anything like their food at burritoholics im sure it will be amazing! 
Their list of options for tequilas was the best you will find in cave creek."}
{"text":"100% perfect service from Josh and a great chef. Food in the creek is subpar. But this place is a gem and incredible food. Salsa beans dips salads all was outstanding. One suggestion, bar needs Crown Royal  
See ya soon!"}
{"text":"We had been waiting for a long time for this little gem to open. The owner had told us he wasn't going to open the doors until he knew he had it right.  After months of waiting, all the kinks were worked out and we finally got to try it out.
  We went for an early dinner the second day they were open, so we weren't expecting perfection. However, we were not the slightest bit disappointed. We wanted to check out as many menu items as possible. Even though they had a shortened menu, it had a lot of options. 
  We started out with the queso, because, well it's queso. It was delicious! Nice and hot, but not spicy. We also had the guacamole, again because it's guacamole. It too was so flavorful and fantastic. I have been a fan of the de la Cruz fam for a long time and love their chips and salsa, which we also devoured. For our entrees, my husband had the carne asada, which he thoroughly enjoyed. I had the shrimp tacos and was a little nervous, because I know how often restaurants get very stingy with the shrimp. That was not the case this time. Lots of big shrimp, flavored with veggies and some kind of aioli type of sauce. Delicious!!!! The refried beans were great, the rice was nice and moist and flavorful.  It was a fantastic meal. We couldn't be more excited to finally have a real, authentic, and delicious Mexican food place up here!"}
{"text":"Well, we went to this restaurant as we live close to it, and read the reviews  which were good.
My wife and I would like to think we are sophisticated diners.
The decor of the restaurant was inviting and warm and I am sure lots of money went into designing the interior.
We read that the queso fundido was quite good.....WRONG. It tasted like spicy Velveeta rather than the delightful Chihuahua we have tasted at other Mexican Restaurants.
I had the spicy camarones as a main course and the red sauce tasted like it came out of a Chef Boyarde can. In addition the shrimp were tiny and the rice cool.
The best part of the meal was the ceviche.
If you want more tasty fare in the vicinity go to Spotted Donkey or if you want to venture a bit further Barrio Queen."}
{"text":"Adorable restaurant. Yes, very limited parking; however, the staff more than makes up for that inconvenience. Downside: VERY pricey for what you get. And HOT. Every item on the menu is fireball hot-- a friend could not take more than a few bites of her Posale (sp?) soup. Cheese is scarce to non-existent, and that on a quesadilla, and I defy anyone to find lime or avocado (at least more than two tiny bites) in their Lime Avocado Salad. The menus are \"this close\" to being illegible, sad to say, and somewhat difficult to navigate (seriously). Ask questions-- lots of questions is my best advice."}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican Food and Cocktails --Really enjoyed our dinner there. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"We have been going to the restaurant at least every week since they opened. Love trying something new every time we go. Everything we have ordered has been delicious. The service is top notch too. Great gem in Carefree/Cave Creek. We recommend the chicken enchiladas, tequila mahi and the fajitas!"}
{"text":"We just had a delicious dinner. The shredded beef enchiladas with Refried beans and rice and the cheese enchiladas with black beans and rice were great. They must have worked out the bumps in the road reported by early reviewers. The service was great as well. We will definitely return to try something else."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get and poor service.  Dined here with friends for dinner on a Saturday evening.  Food is fine, but small portions for the price.  Service was annoying and not customer service oriented.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than my wife and I expected. We ordered enchiladas and tacos and we're pleasantly treated to depth of flavor and the quality of ingredients. Pricey but Delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome fajitas! I have come here a few times now and am never disappointed with the quality of the food. The restaurant itself is small but very aesthetically pleasing. The paintings and art really bring a vibrant tone to the the dining experience. As for the food the guacamole is amazing. They make it fresh everyday and you can obviously tell. I recently tried the lava cake which was good and a tad spicy. Probably made with chili powder. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try fresh Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant the first time on June 17, 2017 during their soft opening. This is what I had to say then. I am posting here because I reviewed it on Facebook and now notice they changed pages and the review on longer shows up. I have been back since and things didn't get better like I thought they would they got worse unfortunately.

Our first visit and I was very happy, wish the app let me do half stars because I'd like to give it 3.5. You can tell they are in a soft opening, but it went much better than I expected. Sat in the back room which is a little isolated and was cold, I always bring a sweater cause most establishments tend to crank up the air, so I didn't bother me. Food was very good, got all the orders right. I had the shredded beef enchilada and the sauce was just wonderful, next time I'm trying the tacos.  Everyone at the table really enjoyed the queso. Margaritas are okay, taste a little like a mix, wish they were fresher and the cheesecake just a tad salty. Waitstaff was fabulous. We will most certainly be back and full expect them to become a 4-5 star as they work out the kinks. Excited to have a good Mexican Restaurant in the area. Tried to check in and review on yelp, but couldn't find you yet, next time.

I tried to go back after their official opening and called for reservations. The woman who answers was rude, then put me on hold for 20 minutes, I hung up and tried to call back but only got a busy signal for another 20 more minutes, I then called next door to burritoholics to let them know they forgot to hang up. They were also snippy and completely unhelpful. I didn't go there that night. I gave them another chance and had my husband make reservation early during the week for a weekend night with friends. The service was not great, the food was okay at best, the margaritas were too much work and they didn't have half the menu which was frustrating. It just wasn't good enough for all the trouble. I haven't been back since, and I really haven't decided if it's worth going back too."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times now! Love to have a Mexican restaurant like this in downtown cave creek. 
Like the margs and chips/salsa. Had the chile verde which is good! Me and my husband will come again! Atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Sizzling fajitas, fresh flour tortillas, lots of slide choices. Kids options are full size for those kids that are almost ready for the adult menu. Chips are thick and homemade salsa has right amount of heat. Margaritas are fully customizable and strong! Great wait staff. Classy but hip a atmosphere, patio would be great once it cools down!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant probably 10 times. Each time I dine I am hoping for a better experience. Without fail they always run out of something. They have run out of the following: Patron
 tequila, guacamole, salad dressing,
Salsa and premium wine. Why is it so hard? In addition, the wait staff is very inexperienced and the turn over very high. Consistency clearly is a huge challenge for this restaurant. The one reason I continue to eat here is because the enchiladas are so delicious. I hope they can improve so I could highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Great food !! A little pricey but with it.
 
Needs to work on their service but I understand it is a new restaurant. We were not given water or greeted at our table for 10 minutes. 

Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Appetizers were great, pleasant surprise to receive such good margaritas outside of Chicago and then had the Carna Asada for main course! Fantastic food and great service!"}
{"text":"This listing is incorrect! They are apparently closed on Monday. We showed up to have dinner and they were closed."}
{"text":"The service (Laura) was excellent. The Posole (chicken) was truly outstanding: generous portion, lots of chicken, excellent flavor. The salsa was spicy and the consistency (thickish) was perfect. Chips were a bit underdone (some chewy centers vs crisp all the way through) and refried beans were more runny than I prefer.  I'll definitely go back and explore the menu further."}
{"text":"Have been here twice in last 2 months very good both times. Queso is great. Service can be a tad slow but if not in a hurry it's good food."}
{"text":"We tried this new restaurant last night. Sure glad we did, fantastic food and drinks. Service was great with friendly staff.   Make sure you try the special corn they offer as a side you won't be disappointed.  If your looking for great food with a nice ambiance don't pass this place."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas, great food, great service.  Impressive. Had the bacon wrapped shrimp as an appetizer and Chile Verde as an entree. Also, great chips and salsa"}
{"text":"We have loved the Carne Asada, Enchiladas. The ceviche is a different style, with raw tomatoes and onions almost like a pico de gallo. It's good. We had the mole, but it was mostly sauce and very little meat, and the flavor wasn't as deep and complex as most mole (it was all chocolate, lacking the spice). The Carne Asada is amazing, however, and highly recommended. Great seasoning on the beef, and alongside the guacamole and corn as a side, it's outstanding. A huge portion, leftovers are also good!  We have been back and  continue to visit. Good food! Beware ...margaritas can be very expensive if you upgrade (upwards of $20). In total our last meal was Ceviche + 2 beers + 1 cocktail + 2 entrees = approx $75

PRO: Food and service great

CON: very noisy restaurant, font on menus illegible (tiny cursive with heavy serif), and if these two things changed we'd have no complaints."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today. It was very nice and the staff was attentive. They do prefer reservations but did accomodate us even though we were walk ins. I did not expect how \"nice\" it was, so i felt a little wierd bringing my family in there with our flip flops but nobody said anything about that so it may have just been me. The carne asada in my tacos was delicious, but needed some sort of sauce. I agree with another review that it is a small amount of food for the price. However, if i had realized it was a little of a nicer place i would still have gone; i would have just went for a date night."}
{"text":"We had been excited to see what went into the old Binkley's and this place was better than we hoped ! I love more upscale Mexican and I couldn't be happier to have this in our area! We started with the queso fondido which was simply delicious. My fiancé got the carne asada tacos which were a hit and I got the avocado lime salad with chicken. The chicken on my salad was cooked perfectly and I loved the vinaigrette. Typically when I try to order salads at Mexican restaurants they always have something deep fried or greasy and this salad was just the opposite. 

One con was we felt their homemade chips lacked salt"}
{"text":"Blown away. I had high hopes - but they were exceeded at every turn. This is the best Mexican food I've had since I moved to Arizona 5 years ago. 

The Quéso Fundido is to die for - as is the Eloté. The chicken fajitas were tender and delicious.

An extensive Tequila selection was the cherry on top... which made for an excellent margarita.

Service was friendly and attentive.

Will return as soon as we can find another babysitter!!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a date night spot but really enjoy good, interesting food. The restaurant is really inviting, has a modern eclectic clean vibe. We were surprisingly wowed by the food. Everything we ate was perfectly executed & delicious! We will definitely be back! The whole experience was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My first one star review! It was almost comical by the end of it (but much, much more expensive than a bad movie). When we heard the table next to us being told the bartender was really busy, it should have been a sign to get something out of a bottle, instead we waited 20 minutes for margaritas, they were far and away the worst we have ever had. It became a torture chamber of trying to get the taste of the food and the taste of the drink out of our mouth until we finally threw in the towel. To be fair the Guac isn't half bad, but having to tell our server everything at least twice and getting water spilled on me kind of cancels that out. We are now on our way to Fry's to make our own margaritas, because how hard can it be? But hey, the manager told us and everyone else leaving to give them one more shot, it'll be better next time. I'll leave that to the readers to decide."}
{"text":"Priced high for mexican food. Small portions. Margaritas are over priced and average. Not very good mexican food."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place opening. Small, cozy place...casual, modern decor. Ordered a margarita right away (stay tuned) Had the Elote (corn) for an appetizer. It was very good. It had a hint of mustard in it which I've never had before, but enjoyed the twist (from normal street corn). During appetizer, I asked our server about my margarita (since I noticed the bartender just standing there doing nothing)...she checked and came back and told me that something happened when she entered it in the computer (???)  and she would place the order again and bring it over ASAP. We then ordered our entrées. My wife had the enchiladas which she enjoyed...and I had the Chili Verde. My dinner had a nice flavor & decent spice level (I like it spicy). However, I would have preferred it in a separate dish or bowl (like a small cast iron skillet) instead of on a plate running all over & surrounding the small dishes that held my sides (kinda gross). By the way...the sides I chose, rice & slaw, were very small & VERY plain. Rice had zero flavor & slaw was dry & worthless (wife's plate was served with a garnish of it?!?) I originally ordered the Fideo but they were out (7:00pm on a Saturday night?!?). Back to the margarita... when our waitress dropped off our entrées (keep in
mind I ordered my drink when she first came by after we sat down) I asked her again about my margarita. She said she would check and, apparently, finally put the order in and I received it halfway through eating my dinner (ridiculous!!!). It came in a tiny champagne style glass (huh???) and after it was filled with ice, there might have been 1 1/2 -2 ounces in it (even MORE ridiculous!!!). The margarita taking over an hour to get served can be chalked up to new opening hiccups, but the overall  quality of food for the way too high price, left me disappointed & again willing to drive an extra 20-25 minutes to La Hacienda or The Mission."}
{"text":"Great place
Excellent staff
Food was very tasty
Authentic Mexican with a flair

Generous portion size
Tried the fajitas 

Worth the drive to
Cave creek"}
{"text":"Great new little place in Cave Creek!  The homemade guacamole was fabulous!  We had the fajitas which were just as good. We are so happy to have another good option for awesome Mexican food close to home!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try this restaurant, but unfortunately it was a letdown at every turn.  The menu is tiny, the prices are exorbitant, the entree portions look like appetizer portions, the rice is flavorless, the beans taste straight out of a can, I could go on and on.  It's such a shame because I have enjoyed their sister restaurant Burritoholics quite a bit since it's opened, but I was disappointed to find that the quality of the food was the same yet the prices were three times as high.  Ultimately, I left Calakmul feeling very hungry and very ripped off."}
{"text":"3 of us had dinner in August. Nice, modern atmosphere, waiter was very knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. Great options-we had chile verde (tender pork, so good, and added a very hot salsa,) mahi tacos ( 2 very filling and fresh,) and also had the chicken rellano and loved it.  All food fresh, modern. Dessert to die for chocolate cake with spicy red sauce topping. We had Mexican beer-but there are many tequila choices. A bit pricey for a 2 star price rating but we would go back any time!"}
{"text":"Calakmul is off to a great start. They have a very large selection of tequilas and feature Margaritas.  The menu has a good variety of traditional Mexican dishes. My wife had the Ahi tacos, and I had the shredded chicken enchiladas. Both were artfully presented, and delicious. The staff was very attentive as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends recommended this restaurant. They said it was different than most Mexican Restaurants. I wasn't impressed. Will I go back, no. Our ticket was $ 30. per person. We were served very small portions. Yes it is different. They cater to couples in an intimate setting. The service was excellent. They do not make frozen drinks. If you are looking for high priced snacks, this is the place."}
{"text":"Went on A Friday night and was eager to see what went into the old Binkley's spot.  We had tried the sister restaurant Burritoholics and had really liked that so we're expecting something as good.  Unfortunately, what we got was meh at best.  Not bad, just not all that great.  I had the grilled shrimp tacos (2 to an order) with a side of the alote.  The alote was by far the star of everything we ate.  The tacos were bland and the slaw on them was flavorless.  Hubs got the mole which was interesting (I'm not a huge mole fan so not the best judge), but he said it was just OK.  also, it could have been warmer.  The black beans tasted straight from a can and the rice was also flavorless.  There are many much better choices for Mexican in the Cave Creek area (including the sister restaurant right next door).  Service was good though and they had a decent house wine."}
{"text":"Who knew Cave Creek has best Mexican food? Just love Burritoholics next door which is owned by the same family as Calakmul. Finally decided to pass the yummy burritos next door and try here and I'm so glad I did. 

The restaurant is upscale in terms of decor, service, cleanliness and food. They have extensive menu offerings but we ordered their fajitas and enchiladas. Food is fresh and full of flavor and accompanied by sides which can be switched up. Don't fill up on the free chips and salsa; save room because the entrees are very filling. 

It's definitely worth the little drive up to Cave Creek. I can't wait to go back and try their other entrees."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.  And some things are very good. Queso and guacamole are great!  Build-your-margarita good concept, but over-priced.  Husbands carne assda overdone. They also forgot  to include the fried jalapeños.  We asked for them, and got an under-fried version.  

To be fair, we ate early. They might want to consider only doing apps when they open and not making the dinner menu avail until 5. That would likely remedy the lack of fried jalapeños and also the fact that the Relleno I wanted to order was 30 minutes out. They were just finishing up stuffing them. 

With a few changes, this place might make it."}
