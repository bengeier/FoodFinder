{"text":"Table of 6: Everything was good... When a waitress came to our table and told us to leave because there was a second service waiting for us to clear the table.  I don't care how much a seat is worth per service. If customers take the time to make reservations, order drinks, appetizers, mains, deserts, and coffees... Find another table for people standing.   I guess you may think 2 hours is enough per service, which in most cases could be true if it didn't take orders 45 minutes to be brought to their respective table. Right?  Repeat business and making customers feel welcome -  obviously is not a priority.  I'll gladly spend my money elsewhere if you don't appreciate the patronage. Last I checked, Restaurants fall under the Service Industry and not under the OrderyourfoodandinhaleitquicklythenpayandtipandgettheFoutASAP Industry."}
{"text":"Bonne expérience dans l'ensemble.  L'accueil et le service étaient attentionnés et courtois.  Les mets étaient bien, mais ne se démarquaient pas de ce qu'on goûte dans d'autres restaurants de ce calibre.  Disons qu'ils étaient \"moyens\" comparés à ceux d'autres bons restaurants.  La carte des vins était complète et le personnel capable de commenter ceux sur lesquels nous avions des questions.  J'y retournerai sans m'attendre à une expérience \"wow\"."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 3 bc the staff was rude but the food was great! Good pizza! Atmosphere was loud but not unbearable. No music. I don't speak French and they didn't have an English menu so that was frustrating. Overall, good food but don't expect to be paid attention to."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Laval for casual dining. Real Italian wood fired pizza and good wines. I go about every month since their opening for business and also with my family. I don't understand the low reviews while chain restaurants get high reviews...c'mon Laval, this is much better than Casa G..."}
{"text":"J'ai aimé à un point que je vais y retourner de temps en temps. C'est juste un peu trop éclairé à mon goût personnel, mais ça c'est chacun ses goûts.   Mais quand la nourriture est excellente, j'y retourne. :-)   Les meilleurs calmars frits que j'ai mangé à Montréal. Leurs pizzas sont superbes.   C'est un restaurant de quartier, avec beaucoup de réguliers, mais aussi un restaurant qu'on va se déplacer pour y aller.   Le service est très bon, voir excellent."}
{"text":"not sure what the fuss is about here. the pizza was average at best and overpriced, especially considering this place is right in little italy where there's an abundance of napoletan style pizza.   the service was careless - servers were scarce and indifferent, and didn't know the wine list at all. we had a booking for a table, and were crushed into the bar with too many others.   i like casual places, but for the price we paid i was pretty unimpressed."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant italien, nous y sommes allés un mardi soir et la salle était pleine, nous avons eu une place rapidement car nous étions que deux mais à partir du jeudi ne comptez pas y aller si vous n'avez pas réservé.  Accueil courtois, dans ce beau décor à l'ambiance italienne.  Cuisine dans le fond du restaurant où nous pouvons voir les pizzaiolos préparer les pizzas et les plats.  À notre arrivée, le serveur nous propose les entrées du jour, Nous optons pour deux entrées différentes afin de goûter et le serveur nous propose même de partager..   Pour moi cannelloni aux deux viandes et carpaccio de veau sauce au thon pour mon mari. Un délice ! Ensuite nous avons eu les yeux plus gros que le ventre, car nous avons opté pour une pizza chacun (Margarita pour moi et une à base d'épinards pour mon mari ). Alors que nous aurions pu opter pour une pizza à 2 et là encore ils nous apportent tout le nécessaire pour pouvoir partager la pizza.   Pizza délicieuse, pâte fine et garniture au top.  Rapport qualité prix correct, de bons produits  A Essayer"}
{"text":"My first weekend in Montreal and I had discovered Petite Italia. With all the great aromas drifting down St. Zotique my choices for dinner were limitless. One in particular had an old-school brick oven and that was good enough for me - don't worry, I plan to hit every other restaurant on that street eventually.  The atmosphere was casual inside and out, with diners ranging from couples to familes to after work socials. I was pathetic dining by myself and had no choice - what to do except ask for a table for one. The maitre d' (who may or may not have been the owner...) sat me at a table right next to the kitchen. Talk about \"dinner and a show.\" For a saturday night it was fairly busy and when I offered not to take up a 4-top by myself to sit at the bar, he replied, \"No sir, sit, relax and enjoy your meal.\" Can't argue with that.  Stephanie, my waitress, took very good care of me. Looking around I saw a lot of dishes that looked great...from the fried zucchini flowers(?) to the pizzas to teh calamari...so much to sample next time. I may also be the first person to review Bottega without being able to comment on their pizza since I ordered a glass of wine and a calzone. Without hesitation it was quite possibly one of the best calzones I've ever had. To top the night off, I finished with the hazelnut gelato and that was pure heaven.  Now the hard part; I was a bit surprised when the bill came and the cheapest glass of wine, a plain mushroom & meat calzone with a cup of gelato along with tip came to over $50 for one person. I'm still learning what constitutes cheap vs expensive in this city so don't let this fool you though - I try to get the most for my money wherever I go. It's pricey in my opinion but the service and atmosphere were great. The food/dessert was amazing and I did not walk out of there still hungry. It's a great place to visit once and a while or for special occasions. Plus, I moved in down the street after that night so there's a good chance I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised this pizza place is so well reviewed. I much prefer Magpie than Bottega. I went there maybe few months ago and it was not memorable at all.  It was busy and the vibe was cool but I won't go back for the pizza!!"}
{"text":"Enfin, après deux tentatives j'ai pu tester ce resto sans me frapper à une porte fermée! Les pizzas sont bonnes et fraîches, mais avec très peu de garniture. La 2ème fois que j'y suis allée, j'ai demandé des oignons en extra et on m'a répondu qu'il n'y en avait pas (!!!) . Le menu est limité et il n'y a pratiquement rien d'autres que des pizzas (et là encore le choix est limité). La salle à manger intérieure est très classe, la terrasse est agréable quoique parfois bruyante grâce aux apprentis Jacques Villeneuve qui roulent sur le boulevard St-Martin avec leur bolide. Les desserts (coupe glacée) sont savoureux. Le gros défaut de Bottega: les prix . Trop élevés pour ce type de cuisine qui n'a rien d'extravagant. Fermé le midi sauf le vendredi et samedi.   Ma deuxième visite m'a confirmé que je n'y retournerai probablement pas."}
{"text":"The experience here at bottega was great ! The wine, the cannoli dessert, most delicious the ravioli appetizer (only available on certain days) and the classic margharita pizza was very good. Me and a few of my friends went there for a birthday celebration about 1 month ago and we all were happy with service, food and of coarse wine selection."}
{"text":"Best pizza crust ever!!  We went here cuz my bf was in the mood for pizza, and he asked me do you know any good pizza place, DO I? hahaha.  Found this place a few years back, aside from pizza they also have the best gnocchi in town, I believe it's the same folks from the now closed Il Mulino restaurant.  The pizzas are fresh and the crust is perfectly crispy while retaining a mild chewy texture. The toppings are simple and fresh.  The bread is fresh and amazing, sadly, it is only served with olive oil and no balsamic vinegar :(  4 stars overall, but 5 stars for pizza and gnocchi"}
{"text":"Really nice place and excellent pizza if you don't mind the crust being a little thick.  I also had a bruschetta with grilled octopus for lunch the other day. That was FANTASTIC.  I would eat that at every meal every day....  Update: the whole office dreams of having lunch there. It a all time favorite. Also brought my kids:  pizza diavolo for one and gnocchi for the other. They want to go back, they are obsessed!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at bottega - told the staff we are leaving and the waitress said 'perfect'. Stay away - they do not deserve your business."}
{"text":"i've gone to bottega twice, the first time it was \"ok\", the second time it was terrible. i don't understand what the hype is, i love good pizza. i've had amazing pizza in rome, venice, boston, and nyc. i have to find great thin crust brick oven pizza in montreal and when i heard about bottega i thought \"this is it! finally good pizza in montreal!\" but alas, not to be. i judge a pizzeria by their margherita, if you can't make a good margherita pizza then whats the point. the first time my pizza had no cheese, and i mean maybe 20% coverage.. i would say a good thin crust pizza should have about 50% cheese coverage, a few nice pieces of fresh mozarella. the second time i come i ask for a little extra cheese to compensate for last time, and what i got was barely edible. it was as if the cheese and sauce had fused into this pink watery slime. the crust was soaked. it was one of the worst pizzas i've ever eaten.   maybe i need to give them another shot, but at what point do you stop giving a restaurant chances to get even the most basic things right? i don't recall the sauce being anything remarkable either."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing and the wine list was great. It has to be one of the most delicious places to eat in greater Montreal. Unfortunately I feel that due to the way  my guests and I were treated , I cannot award more than three stars. After a $350  bill ( excluding tip) split four ways, I did not expect the owner to stand next to our table for half an hour staring at us. He was obviously upset that we spent 2 hours at the establishment. He had customers waiting to be seated so he tried to make us feel uncomfortable enough to leave . When he saw that this did not work , he had his waiter ask us to leave. Not only was this rude, it was embarrassing. We may have overstayed our welcome but at the amount of money we spent on wine and food, we deserved to be treated with a little more class.  I will never step foot in this location again. While the food was amazing, customer service and appreciation was not.   How would I have handled the situation? I would ask the guests if they would want to purchase another item on the menu! This is a nice way of saying please buy some more or leave....( this was not done by the waiter)...if that doesn't work, politely say to the guests that others are waiting , that you feel horrible to ask them to leave and perhaps give them a free piece of cake to bring home or a small pizza. A gesture like this says...I care about you Mr customer however I also need to serve my other waiting customers. ....common sense !"}
{"text":"Was walking by with my dogs and wanted to have a bite. Their terrasse, being on the sidewalk as it is, seemed a reasonable spot for us to stop. But the dude we asked a table for didn't waste time in rudely telling us he wouldn't set us with our dogs."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Laval, by far !!! Only improvement could be to add a few more daily specials. Especially some more daily pasta specials, and maybe a pizza special of the week, like a Sicilian pizza with pistachio pesto and salciccia , hint hint !!"}
{"text":"I've been back a handfull of times since the last update and I haven't seen my \"favorite\" waitress. So I'm back to being a fan! It's a must to ask about the daily specials for dinner and dessert. They always have something homemade to choose from. Here, it's simply fresh, authentic Italian cuisine. You can't ask for more than that in today's resto scene. BUT you must ask to have your pizza pie cut (and make it very clear to your waiter) or you will be cutting it yourself.  When you eat here, you feel fresh afterwards- not heavy.  Idea: they really need to go with the Dyson Airblade. The washrooms are quite slick, yet they installed the most oldschool, ugly hand dryers. It just doesn't fit lol"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Pizza are good even tough the dought is a bit too thick for an Italian restaurant. Not all waiter were welcoming..."}
{"text":"I don't understand the big fuzz about this place. It's overrated. The pizza is average, the tables are too close to each other, and it's noisy. The service is fast but most of the waiters aren't smiling. Our waiter didn't explain the items off the menu and we didn't get bread. I wish I would have appreciated more my experience here but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us dined at Bottega on a Saturday night.   Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, so we waited at the bar. As an apology for the wait, we were each given a complimentary glass of wine. A+ on the customer service!  As an entree, we had calamari, served with lemon.  They were perfectly cooked - the texture was great, but the oil used tasted very mildly burnt.   The star is the pizza! The margherita and capricciosa were delicious! The crust is thin, crispy on the outside and chewy in the center - amazing. The sauce is simple and clean, and has a rich tomato flavour.  And the cheese .. mmm."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a high quality \"single serve\" pizza like you get on the streets of Rome, this is a place for you!  We very much enjoyed the food and the friendly. \"young professional\" service.  Felt like it was on the 'fringe' of Little Italy; you didn't feel like you were in the middle of a touristy restaurant zone."}
{"text":"WOW!!! meilleure pizza à Montréal by far!!! Quel délice :) J'ai pris la Margherita, simple et excellent. Super service et ambiance.  Le gelato comme dessert au basilic!!! incroyable, celui à la noisette était aussi très bon. J'y retournerais, c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"Good naples style pizza.  Everything was true to the Neapolitan style on my margherita pizza-the one named for a Princess from the 19th century who first had the dish.  We talked to and watched the pizzaolas.  90 seconds or less in a 900 degree oven.  00 flour from Naples.  San Marzano tomatoes with a little salt-no garlic, etc.  Fresh milk mozarella.  Dissapointed that a high end place like this can't make a buffalo mozarella pizza, but you can't have everything.  Very interesting wines, icnluding a Sardinian one which our friends ordered.  A spicy soprasetta or capicola was on my friends pizza which had the perfect level of heat.  NOt as good as Motorino New York, but great anyways.  Compare to Magpie in montreal, the sauce and cheese were better, but Magpie has an amazingly good crust, and is not really cooked in the traditional Neapolitan style as prescribed by VPN.  But both are enjoyable.    Bottega had some very nice Italian appetizers, such as a great aranicini-seems to be the standard for authentic Neapolitan restaurants.  Meat balls, salad, cod fish croquettes (crocetta di baccala) were all good.  Very upscale feel for a pizzaria.  Price was a bit much for us, but we went a little crazy on ordering.   Nutella pizza at the end-kids loved it.  Homemade gillatta-very good."}
{"text":"Years ago I spent 4 days in Napoli, Italy.  The little pizza restaurant next to my hotel made the BEST thin crust pizza I ever tasted.    Years later I end up in Montreal, and heard there were TWO restaurants that did very good wood-fire-Napoli -style Pizza.  Bottega and Magpie.      I tried both, and found Bottega to be the best.   The service was prompt and efficient.   I did not have a reservation, but was seated, with the advisory that I had about 40 minutes.    I ordered the Margherita pizza - which was quickly delivered.  The crust was perfection - the sauce -simple and slightly sweet - not too acidic. the taste of the Basil came through perfectly balanced.   The Wood Fire Oven is in the back of the restaurant - but visible and cool to watch.  The vibe of the restaurant is modern, active and a bit on the noisy side.  It's full always - and a bit loud with a lot of conversation, but it was bearable.   I tried Magpie - but the service was not great, while the crust was good - I prefer that of Bottega.   My Go-to Napoli style pizza in Montreal is now Bottega!  Bravo!   Value for Money - $$$  out of $$$$$.  A bit on the pricey side (about same as Magpie) ."}
{"text":"We are impressed with the atmosphere. The only positive comment we have about this place is that dishes are very affordable, or completely inexpensive.    For starters, we order a veal meatball with tomato sauce and a cannelloni alla bolongnese. Ok, veal meatball came out directly from the oven, very hot very tasty to start with. Cannelloni is average. Would not repeat this dish next time.   However, the crust was a thin crust but too soft, and doughy, feeling a bit too spongy/chewy. The tomato sauce does not taste much. The toppings, very few eggplants and only ONE piece of basil in a 12-inch pizza. The boccoccini cheese was alright. Nothing much i can say about."}
{"text":"Amazing food, most authentic italian pizzeria in Montreal. The one in Laval  is also good but lacks the authenticity that this location offers with the italian staff and location in little Italy."}
{"text":"The best of Montreal's high-end wood-burning-oven Restos. Also, make sure to order the meatball appetizer and the rice balls..."}
{"text":"After reading the amazing reviews, I was so excited to try the pizza at Bottega!  Wow what a let down. The crust is soggy and undercooked (all 6 pizzas ordered) and the woman next to us sent hers back twice before giving up and leaving without eating.   The arancini was disappointing & dry and didn't come with any marinara.  The bacia was bland.  Great bright decor for a lunch spot but the pizza is just so bad, who cares?!  And this is not just my personal opinion, the tables on both sides of me were also complaining of soggy pizzas!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the pizza margarita, which we got to go. The crust seems nice, but for something that was $17 with tip it was disappointing. Needed more sauce, but then the center of the pizza would have been soggy so, not sure. The other ingredients were lacking in quantity as well. The single basil leaf kills me, but maybe I don't know that much about this type of pizza. I think more basil would help with making this dish more flavourful.  We ended up using Kraft dressing and hot sauce to make this more appetizing. Considering the two other pizzerias (at least) within a 5 minute walk, I'd try another place for pizza."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend after we heard how good the pizza were and how authentic this place is.  We got there and the place was pretty empty and we were told that we can only be seated at the bar and that we had to be gone by 7:30. I am not going to lie it was a bit of a turn off but I figure I am here might as well we eat and being that it was 5:30 we still had 2 hrs to eat. Within one hour the place was packed. I don't remember the pizza I picked but it was amazing cheese, olive, mushroom and prosciutto. My friend got a Margherita pizza and it was also very fresh a s tasty.  I had an entree of olive with some bread and very good olive oil. It is a fancy and expensive place but you do get good service and very good food. Next time I will try the pasta and see if they are as good as the pizzas"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during December to have some authentic Italian pizza but wasn't extremely impressed to be honest. The restaurant is beautiful with excellent service and a varied menu. We decided to split the Arancini and the meatball to start and then had an arugula pizza topped with extra prosciutto. The starters were just ok - I've had better arancini elsewhere and the meatball was borderline flavorless. The pizza was good! No complaints there except for the hefty $6 price tag for three slices of proscuttio added. Ended with some delicious sorbet which I want to say is made in-house but can't be sure. Overall a good experience - come for the pizza but skip the apps!"}
{"text":"Excellent place!  My husband and I were staying at the hotel behind the restaurant and decided to give it a try. We were very pleased with the whole experience from the service to the wine. The food was great and no complaints."}
{"text":"Usually this place is great But the second time I visited it was my last Ordered a Margareta pizza with a side of olives. Both me and my wife got food poisoning (some virus), ended up in the hospital. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Quand ce resto a ouvert je ne me gênais pas pour dire qu'ils avaient la meilleure pizza en ville. A la fois delicate pour sa pâte mais généreuse en garniture fraîche et recherchée . J'y retourne dernièrement avec des amies et sans dire que c'était mauvais, je n'ai pas retrouvée la satisfaction de jadis. J'ai mangé les boulettes de veau en entrée, bonnes sans plus et ma pizza était de pâte mouillée et pauvre en garniture. Tellement de choix maintenant que ce ne sera plus un endroit que je vais conseiller. Par contre les prix sont raisonnables.."}
{"text":"OH YEAH!! Three words: authentic. Neapolitan. Pizza. It's simple, delicious and the way pizza should be made!  The other items on the menu are excellent as well. I've tried the daily specials there too and I've yet to be disappointed. I suggest making reservations as it gets busy and there really isn't anywhere to wait. They have a bar but on busy nights even that is full. It's a happening place with great food. It'a a no-brainer. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"The pizza was better than the apps but nothing special. Had the meatball, arachini, arugula salad, all lacked something that would make it special. Service was good. Been twice, both times I left feeling meh."}
{"text":"Bottega serves quality food from top to bottom and always offers new and delicious appetizers which, so far, have never disappointed me or my guests. I have been there 6 different times now and have never walked out thinking the meal I just had was nothing but, at the minimum, a solid experience. It's a well-run restaurant.  I always order the Caprese pizza because I cannot resist the combination of ingredients. It tastes great and as everyone else says the crust is amazing but I do feel like sometimes the middle part of the pizza becomes soggy and a bit mushy. This might often be the case when using cherry tomatoes and I am not sure if there's a way around it?   The prices are a bit high but what you get in return is a level of freshness rarely found in other restaurants in the city so at least, you know the prices are not totally unfair. They do not skimp on quality. Besides, it's hard to argue their prices are too high since the place is almost always jam packed for dinners, especially late in the week.  Service has always been very good despite how busy they are. The waiters are friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  Good eats await you at Bottega and for me has yet to ever disappoint.  Vegetarian food: 4.0 Value: 4.0 (it's expensive but the quality of ingredients is A+) Service: 4.5"}
{"text":"S*cks! Way over priced for what u get...Don't like the vibe & ambiance. Why people here pretend to be something they are not???  No way I shall be back."}
{"text":"We walked by this place earlier in the afternoon and loved the outdoor patio so we came back for dinner. The staff was wonderful and the patio was, indeed, perfect.   The server recommended an excellent red wine to start. Then we had the burrata and speck, both really good but overpriced for what you get. The arancino was great and finally we ordered the margherita pizza. His was Napoli style and made to perfection. It's what I was hoping it would be and it met my very lofty expectations."}
{"text":"A friend just asked me where to find a great pizza in Montreal, and I was reminded of Bottega.  You can hear all about the owner's quest to learn the secrets of his ancestors by studying the intricacies of the perfect pizza in Naples on his website; this is not just advertising hype however - the pizza is cooked to perfection in about 90 seconds in a 900 degree pizza oven - perfect dough, simple ingredients and sumptuous sides make for the perfect Italian food experience - the rapini and sausage were better than my Sicilian mother-in-law's, and that's saying something!(but be warned, if it's gobs of mozzarella cheese you're looking for, then this is not the place for you!)     The ambience is busy and cheerful - urban but not sterile.  (Highly recommended too, by my guy Joe, who has Sicilian blood, and is not easily impressed by Italian restaurants...)"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. Their tomato sauce is delicious. They have excellent meatballs and smoked burrata, plus simple, tasty salads and great pizza (probably not a great takeout pie, but wonderful when right out of the oven). Everything just tastes super fresh. The service is friendly and attentive. Good value all around. The atmosphere is boisterous without being too noisy. It's a smart-looking, well-maintained joint; whoever runs the place obviously takes pride in it."}
{"text":"I always get my Margherita pizza here and it's on point each time. I find that the pizza here comes our soggy a bit but that's what makes it so delicious. I also get my chocolate pistachio gelato here.   The price range per dish is $$ which is not bad for a nice restaurant in Laval.   Definitely visit for yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"Service impécable et pizza pathétique. La sauce tomate trop acide manque cruellement de saveur, elle est d'ailleurs disposée en faible quantité sur la pizza. La garniture ( un demi artichaut coupé 4, 5 champignons insipides et un quart de tranche de jambon) joue à cache-cache dans mon assiette. La pâte brûlée laisse une amertume en bouche. La serveuse essaye diplomatiquement de me dire que c'est une pizza napolitaine. Pour avoir passer mes vacances à Napoli, je leur suggère de ne pas participer à une compétition de pizza dans la ville de Naples, ils feraient rire d'eux."}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza que j'ai mangée dans ma vie! Je me ferais faire un t-shirt pour en faire la promo tellement c'est bon... Une grande épicurienne m'a dit qu'elle n'avait rien goûté de tel depuis son voyage à Naples.  Mes coups de coeur: L'arancino (croquette de riz farcie au proscuitto) et la polpetta en entrée et la margherita comme plat principal. Ils ont toujours des plats du jour (off menu) à proposer. Évidemment, il faut essayer le gelato maison pour dessert. Pistaches, pistaches, pistaches...  Simple, frais, pas trop salé. Personnel accueillant, sympathique et efficace. Réservez quelques jours à l'avance (surtout si vous voulez y aller la fin de semaine). Terrasse sur le trottoir (pour les amateurs de \"manger dehors\"). Stationnement à l'arrière."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows real pizza will agree that this place serves the best Napolitan pizza in Montreal. The dough and crust is simply spectacular."}
{"text":"Great casual Italian restaurants in Little Italy.  Good place to go with friends and family.  Everything is super fresh and well prepared.  We end up sharing a bunch of small plates when we go but their pizzas are great too.   Caprese salad and gnocchi are not to be missed.  Dessert is awesome too, the tiramisu is the best I've had in Montreal.  Good wine list as well.  Usually boisterous and lively with fairly high noise level."}
{"text":"I think I'm becoming a regular at Bottega. There are times when I go twice a week; for good reason though. They make the best authentic Italian pizzas in MTL, along with other traditional Italian dishes. I personally believe their pizzas are the closest thing to the real deal that you could find.   I recently traveled to Naples and ate at the world renown \"Da Michele's\". Upon my return I went to Bottega to compare pizzas.  I must say, it doesn't taste exactly like the pizza in Naples, but it comes pretty friggin' close!  For that,  I must give Bottega a huge shout out for representing the beauty and simplicity in Italian cuisine.   When I order, I usually get the classic margarita pizza. You could never go wrong with that. It's the original and it's the best! However, if you're not in the mood for pizza, there's a variety of pasta dishes to order as well.   They serve very good gelato too. Their hazelnut and pistachio flavours are killer!   Don't forget to wash down your meal with a delicious shot of chilled limoncello!    It's not that expensive. You could eat great for 20$.  Enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and atmosphere  Excellent Italian food that was very fresh. A definite place we will go back to.  Great family atmosphere. Restaurant seemed to be filled with regulars when we went (the waiters greeted many of the patrons by name as they arrived) - after eating there I can see why they love it too!"}
{"text":"I came for dinner one night on my latest trip. I was staying nearby and their menu appealed to me. I got the cold shoulder immediately from the host. I was told there was a table but I only had an hour. Okay, fine, whatever. I'm used to the Montreal attitude, I just take it in stride by now.   I am seated and the waiter was nice. I ordered a bottle of sparkling water but he really pushed me to buy alcohol. I said no but it was awkward. I got their salad special of the night which was a shaved fennel, beet, and grapefruit salad. It was quite refreshing and delicious.  Then I got the caprese pizza. For 18 dollars, I thought it was overpriced for what you got. Now I tend to eat a lot and I ate it all. So for two people, you might need 2 pizzas if you don't eat anything else. The crust is super thin and while that is kind of nice on the edge where it gets crispy, the center is very soggy and sloppy. It was mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I am vegan and they were very accommodating with substitutions.  The pizza is DElicious. The rapini is great. The gelato is awesome. I got the granita. Service was good. Only reason i gave 4 stars is the location and just a little over priced. But i will be going back on the regular. Just found my new favorite spot in laval."}
{"text":"Bottega is rated on google as the #1 place for pizza in Montreal. I ordered the pizza margarita, my favorite. It arrived quickly, too quickly and looked very nice. but  I found its texture to be limp and rubbery. It turned cold within a few minutes.  I expect a good pizza to be crispy on the bottom. This can be achieved by baking it thoroughly. The waiter explained that their wood-burning oven is set at 900 degrees so that the pizza is ready to be served quickly. Any additional baking time would render a burnt pizza. I would recommend that they lower the temperature of the oven and bake the pizza longer. Their under-cooked, limp pizza is a far cry from #1 in my books."}
{"text":"Toujours un très bon service, la nourriture est bonne et les familles sont les bienvenues!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Enjoyed one of the best Italian meals in the city. Great appetizers, the pizza is AMAZING! (the dough is just incredible from their wood burning oven), and finished the evening with delicious desert. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Mid-sized restaurant that fills up very quickly,even on a week night; we were a party of 9 and I had arrived early (6PM), our reservation (a must),was for 6:30,by 7 the place was already full. Our waiter was very attentive,courteous and informative,but unintrusive,which is always good. Our orders were taken without much ado,since no one wanted drinks,but the appetisers were a bit slow coming;since so many include pork, which I don't eat,I passed,but my companions seemed to enjoy theirs. Next we each ordered their famous pizzas: I ordered the Siciliana,which is your basic tomato and cheese with eggplant. There certainly were the two aforementioned ingredients,but not much in the way of eggplant,just a few chunks,and the crust was a teeny bit under cooked. My companions had the Margaritha,essentially the same thing,without the eggplant,they really enjoyed theirs, one ordered with extra cheese,another with extra oil and garlic...extra charge too. For desserts,you get a choice of gelato,biscotti,or tiramisu,I just opted for cappuccino,but four of my companions ordered;one mistook the choice of biscotti as one choice,but was very surprised when he got a platter of biscotti,all different choices. The two who ordered the tiramisu,were also surprised when theirs came on a platter with not one but THREE cakes! The gelato guy was probably the only one who got shortchanged here as his serving,although generous,was not enough for three people. As pizzas go,good,but not exceptional,desserts: copious,cappuccino: very good,service: excellent,price:not cheap,but won't break your bank account either."}
{"text":"Great crust and definitely solid pizza. Not the best I've had in Montreal but up there."}
{"text":"Ma pizza préférée à Montréal. Sérieux, elle est siiii bonne! L'ambiance est un peu m'as-tu-vu, donc il m'arrive de la prendre pour emporter. J'en ai déjà pris une à manger dans le parc de la Petite-Italie, vraiment pas très loin de là!  La texture de la pâte est divine, avec un bon goût de four à bois. Juste assez élastique sous la dent. Je recommande fortement la pizza margherita; un classique au sommet de la perfection. Tomates San Marzano goûteuses, mozzarella fraîche et basilic... Un délice! Je conseille de prendre 1 pizza chaque, mais de les couper en 2 et les partager."}
{"text":"Calamari was fantastically delicious!! Oven baked Pizza was great too!! Parking in the back of the restaurant very convenient!"}
{"text":"We were staying at a rental place in the area and our landlord recommended Bottega as one of his favorites.  He was right about that!  We had a terrific meal here with very good service, very lovely wine selections, great fresh and gourmet selections on the menu, not just the pizza.  We did like the wood-fired pizza, I've had a bit better before, but it is solid and makes for a nice meal.  My only complaint is that they don't cut the pizza and I know that's traditional, but it makes it a pain to try to cut at your table.   Our real favorites were all the other things besides the pizza on the menu.  The arancini were the best we've ever had.  It's a nice place but not putting on airs and entirely comfortable.  In the summer they have a lovely little terrace for dining."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great service! Went at 9, place was full and yet we received our dishes within minutes of ordering them. Staff was attentive all evening. Would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Laval Bottega location for the better part of the last decade. A recent gathering of friends brought me to the 'original location' in beautiful Little Italy. I was excited to find out if this location offered the same quality of food or if there was a notable difference in any way.  The first thing I noticed was that this location is probably half the size of the Laval location. The decor is about the same and it promotes a warm and intimate environment, ideal for a date or special occasion with a significant other.  I went with their polpetta (meatball drenched in tomato sauce and Italian herbs), a marinara pizza as a main and for dessert their Nutella pizza!  The polpetta is so underappreciated I can't help to recommend it to everyone I eat here with. Sure, the price-tag of $4 per meatball is off-putting but trust me... try it. It's perfect and it will leave you wanting for more. In some ways it was so good it sometimes overshadows the main course for me. Thinking about it right now makes me drool...  I'd go here and order 5 of them and just leave a happy man.  I went with their marinara pizza and while it was good I will freely admit I was somewhat disappointed but it. I expect my pizza to maximize.the space in my plate with a perfect crust ratio and for some reason my pizza was somewhat deformed. It wasn't round but more so leaf shaped? Furthermore, the crust was too thick which left me less tomato/igredient goodness in the middle to enjoy. I enjoy the crust but I'd recommend better preparation.  For dessert we shared the Nutella pizza and it was sublime. Thankfully it was properly prepared being perfectly round with little crust to deal with.   Price-tag is a little high but it's worth it.  Overall I enjoyed it but I much prefer the Laval location for a variety of reasons.   Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of places in the Montreal region you can get your hands on some great authentic Napoletan pizza. This place is a regular for my wife and I.  I won't go into all the details but the Pizzas are great. Thin crust, focus on the quality of the ingredients. Fresh and tasty.  Quebecois beware. There aren't handfuls of toppings, the Quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza.  The arancini balls are very very good.  Their Nutella Pizza is a favorite of ours too.  Service is quick and friendly.  My highlights are when the owner passes by and says hello and I get to converse some of my rusty Napoletan. :)"}
{"text":"Bottega is located on Zotique in the Little Italy neighborhood. I'll be honest, I was planning to go to Pizzeria Napoletana, but the lineup was huge so me and my friend ended up here. Bottega has a very interesting food  menu  & a big wine list. One of the things I liked is they have zucchini flowers on the menu (Seasonal of course). We tried the Arancini. Wasn't a big fan. It was too dry. The pizza was good but not as good as magpie. There's something about the tomato sauce at magpie that makes their pizza's special. Sorry Bottega, you are #2 when it comes to pizza. I'd pick pizza at Magpie anyday .  Food : Good Service :Fast Ambiance : Casual Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Je suis souvent allée chez Bottega à Mtl et toujours eu une bonne expérience....  Ce soir a dépassé mes attentes avec la pizza du jour au Burrata, basilic, pesto, tomates. Miammm!! J'encourage le chef à mettre ce plat à la carte... Plat absolument délicieux :)"}
{"text":"Bon restaurent! Nous y sommes aller le mardi soir et le restaurent était rempli! Le service est impeccable, l'ambiance chaleureuse. Nous avons commandé des calmars frits, qui étaient à la hauteur de nos attentes! Seul hic, les pizzas sans sauce, à mon avis, manquent de goût: pour ma part, pizza aux légumes grillés qui étaient plutôt éparses et peu goûteux, dommage."}
{"text":"Reservations a must otherwise a 30 minute wait is in order. Extremely limited menu. Pleasant service. Most pizzas offered are simply made with bland sauce and microscopic amounts of cheese. White chewy dough with burnt spots on crust. Only 2 meat options for pizzas. $8 per shrimp. I'm not really sure why this place is often packed  but if your big on artisanal pizzas with barely any toppings, this place will please you. Otherwise pick another place if your looking for a satisfying decadent pie."}
{"text":"Superbe pizza au four à bois grand variété de vin bon service je vous le recommande et prix abordable et tout le  personnelles est bien courtois."}
{"text":"Excellent;-D  Love the atmosphere and cuisine Service is great Definitely best Italian in Laval Be sure to reserve on weekends since it is very busy."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd ever find good pizza in QC, where your average slice-o' is nothing short of appalling. Glad I heard about this place. Waitress was so nice as to arouse mild suspicion in my rude-New-Yorker bones. I wish they had beer that wasn't $7 bottles of Moretti, but they more than made up for it with a delicious margherita pie and world-class bread and olive oil. PS if you ask, they have both mozzarella di bufala (a highly recommended upgrade) and shaved truffles available."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and twice I was salivating for \"the best pizza in town\" and twice I have left disappointed.  The first time, I ordered the pepperoni pizza. It's about a 10\", scare on the cheese side of things. The wood-oven crust, which I had been looking forward to the most, failed to impress me. Yes, it is a good crust, but I feel I have had better elsewhere.   The second time, I had a calzone, sort of pizza roll (think glorified pizza pocket). I am sure there are excellent calzones out there, just not at this place. Just   Overall, the pizzas are very artisanal and feel authentic. The service is so-so; water did not get refilled, it takes a long time to be seated or to get acknowledged, and you are hushed out if you are done.   The ambiance is nice, good for a romantic date. The tables are too close to each other however and we often found ourselves almost in the conversation of our neighbours."}
{"text":"On mange bien à Bottega ! Ma pizza aux anchois était bonne, la pâte et la garniture étaient vraiment à mon goût ! Le service a été super rapide, en moins de 10 minutes ma pizza a été servie et j'y étais un jeudi soir à 19h ! La carte des pizzas me donnaient envie et il y a 2 types de pizzas, celle avec ou sans sauce tomate. Il faudra tester les autres ... :) Pour le dessert j'ai pris un classique tiramisu mais que c'était bon, j'ai adoré la présentation avec 3 boules de tiramisu. On a l'impression de se faire servir 3 boules de glaces au premier abord, j'ai cru à une erreur au début :) Au niveau des prix je trouve cela dans la normal, le service était très agréable et prévenant ! A refaire sans hésitation :)"}
{"text":"Went there on a friday night with my boyfriend. We loved it! The ambiance is really nice and the decor too. Their pizzas are so good!! The waiter was friendly and answered our questions well. We really loved our experience there and will definetly go back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night. Waiter at first seemed cold and indifferent, but after engaging the conversation with him he seemed pretty nice. I guess since the place is so popular and busy the waiters no longer care about the customers?  The eggplant appetizer wasn't really memorable, but the pizza was great. The dough and the way it's baked is really what sets this pizzeria apart. However, service was so quick we didn't really have the chance to enjoy our evening. We ordered at 6h15 and by 7h15 we were done and the bills were already paid. I guess they want a fast customer turnaround..."}
{"text":"This is not your average pizzeria.  Most people who've had the pizza here are split on this place!  I happen to love it!  If you're looking for an american style with thick crust and cheap toppings, go somewhere else.  If you're looking for (in my opinion) one of the best italian style thin chewy crust pizzas in MTL, check this place out!  Everything else on the minute is above par; the sfizzi are all delicious!  The atmosphere is classy and well lit.  If you haven't been, you owe it to yourself to check this place out and make up your own mind on their pizza.  If you've never been to Italy and want to know what a real pizza taste like... Head to this place and try a margherita!  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. I came here for a good margarita pizza, and this place did not disappoint! Thin crust. Slight burns. Great sauce. What a win!  I celebrated my gfs birthday with her family and they were even cool enough to prepare a Nutella pizza for her with a candle on the crust. That's good service for you."}
{"text":"I wanted to sample Bottega after fellow Yelper Jason had raved about their pizza as being one of the best you can enjoy in Montreal's sister suburb Laval. OK I was thinking in my head? Does Jason know pizza or does he merely think he knows pizza? Conclusion....this is one of the best pizzas I've had in a long while since my trip to Italy last year. One of my other favourite pizzas is American Flatbread in Burlington, VT.  I'd rank up there with what I'd consider some of the best pizza I've sampled. Let me explain folks.....I enjoy pizza with mega toppings. Yes....if you visit Italy you will have people squinting at you with some weird looks if you ask for an\"all dressed\" (toute garnie) pizza pie. A true Napoli style pizza is very simple and the loaded pizza is more the American creation that will add extra padding below the belt line. Here (at Bottega)  as others have mentioned they keep it simple. Not crazy amounts of toppings. So I ended up going with the Capricossa. I was told by our server that this was the most loaded pizza on the menu. It was crisp yet the dough had a nice fluffiness to it also and a wonderful texture of flavour that was dancing around in my mouth. Before my pizza I had the calamari as an appetizer which is also one of my favourites when done correctly. Squid was light crispy and delicious as well.   One note to keep in mind this is mainly a higher end pizza joint. They do have appetizers on the menu but no pasta dishes. Also some expect bring your own wine. This is not one of those places but they have a pretty well stocked bar.   Definitely worth returning as the pizza was amazing. If you are thinking about Italian in Laval and want pizza come here rather than going to Enotecca Mozza or Portovino. For the pizza it's miles above those places."}
{"text":"Bien manger dans la petite Italie, belle soirée garantie ! Parfait pour une soirée en amoureux ou avec sa famille.   Si vous souhaitez manger une bonne pizza italienne accompagnée d'un bon vin à Montréal, l'endroit pour le faire est certainement le Bottega.   Les prix des entrées tournent autour de 10$, et celui des pizzas autour de 15-20$. Pour la qualité du repas et la fraicheur des aliments, le prix est absolument dérisoire. J'y suis allée pour la boulette de viande en sauce tomate, les calamars frits, la salade de roquette et la pizza aux anchois. Tout était très bon, mais aussi très simple. J'aime qu'on puisse goûter à une saveur unique, mais parfois un peu de fantaisie serait appréciée. On reste dans le classique disons, mais ça fait le charme.   Lors de mes deux visites, le service a été très rapide. De plus, les serveurs connaissent clairement le menu sur le bout de leurs doigts. Un service très professionnel et courtois. On sent que ce n'est pas un endroit avec un gros roulement du côté du personnel (ce qui est souvent une bonne chose).   Le menu des vins est bien, une bonne sélection d'importations privées agréables à découvrir."}
{"text":"I'm not really big into salt, but I had to add a ton of it to give my meal have flavour. Very disappointed. Maybe they were having an off night. On the bright side, our waitress was very kind and attentive. She knew the menu and specials inside out!"}
{"text":"The food in Bottega is really good and the pizza has unique flavour. Zucchini flowers for appetizer - what a treat!"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to being in Naples and having what is the best pizza in the world.  Bottega clearly managed to bring to our fair city an honest taste of Napoli without question.  It can get a little pricey however, for those who have had a margherita in either Naples, Ischia or Capri, then you know this spot is worth it and you can leave the Euros at home for another time.  Put this down as a must try if you haven't already.  Keep in mind most do know how good it is so it does get very busy."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fresh ingredients, charming wait staff, comfortable multicultural family vibe. Super wine list, hip decor. Just go."}
{"text":"C'était ma première expérience à la Bottega Pizzeria de Laval et ça va également être la dernière.  J'ai commandé les gnocchis au fromage bleu et noix de pin ; décevant.  Moi qui est un amateur de bleu je n'y ai décelé aucun goût de bleu.  J'y étais avec des amis et ce qui goûtait le mieux était la pizza au fromage, tomates et basilic.  Simple et savoureuse. L'entrée, un fromage mou super délicieux était à se régaler, mais c'était tout ce que j'ai eu comme expérience gastronomique.  J'ai eu l'audace de demander du beurre avec mon pain et c'est là que le tout a dégénéré.  J'ai beaucoup insisté auprès de la serveuse pour du beurre mais elle m'a dit qu'il n'en avait pas (!!!)  Voyons donc, une cuisine qui n'a pas de beurre ?  Je n'y crois pas.  Peu de temps après, je voyais une dame qui rôdait autour de notre table ; plaçant les chaises des tables voisines tout en jetant un coup d'il à la nôtre.  J'en ai déduit, et avec raison, que c'était la gérante.  Elle m'a dit que le restaurant voulait nous donner une expérience typiquement italienne... allo !  J'étais assis à l'extérieur, avec un espace de pelouse d'un mètre, le trottoir... et le boulevard Saint-Martin à Laval, avec tout son bruit et sa pollution.  On repassera pour l'expérience typiquement italienne.  Et sous prétexte qu'on veut me donner cette expérience italienne on me refuse du beurre ?  Ça me laisse un goût amer au sujet de l'Italie.  Je crois que la gérante à mal géré mon cas ; devant mon insistance, elle aurait pu faire une petite entorse et m'apporter un peu de beurre.  Elle avait également une mauvaise attitude ; elle voulait avoir raison à tout prix et que je sois dans le tort à tout prix.  Le pire c'est qu'elle me dit que ce n'est pas bon pour mes artères que de manger du beurre et qu'ils en avaient seulement que lorsqu'ils servaient des pâtes au beurre et romarin... euh, quand c'est dans les plats cuisinés par eux, le beurre devient bon pour la santé ?   Elle me disait qu'elle-même était italienne et qu'elle avait ce problème avec son mari québécois... personnellement, je n'aime pas le goût de l'huile d'olive sur du pain à la place du beurre ; c'est une question de goût.  Je comprends que si j'avais demandé qu'on me serve des sushis, je n'étais pas à la bonne place... mais du beurre !  Si élémentaire.  En tant que client, je ne me suis pas senti respecté ; quand j'ai mentionné que c'était la dernière fois que j'y mettais les pieds, j'ai eu un \" petit acquiescement \" de sa part... comme si elle semblait dire que des clients comme moi, ils n'en voulaient pas.  Et moi qui croyait, naïvement que le client avait toujours raison... en tout cas, pas à la Bottega Pizzeria de Laval.  Dommage car je sors régulièrement manger dans les restos de Laval, à toutes les semaines.  PLUS JAMAIS À CET ENDROIT !"}
{"text":"Voici une véritable pizzeria italienne. Dans ce resto au décor chic, vous ne trouverez pas au menu les habituelles \" all-dress \" ou \" meat lover \". Non. Bottega offre plutôt des pizzas préparées dans la pure tradition italienne, dont des pizzas dites \" blanche \", c'est-à-dire sans sauce tomate. Elles sont toutes cuites au four à bois, ce qui ajoute à la saveur.   Les prix des pizzas sont relativement abordables. Les entrées, par contre, sont un peu chers, mais on arrive à s'en sortir pour une facture d'environs 35 $ par personne (pourboire non inclus). Pour bien débuter votre repas, laissez vous tenter par les entrées de salade avec prosciutto et copeaux de mozzarella. Humm... très italien.   Le resto est bien situé sur le boulevard St-Martin à la jonction de l'autoroute 15. L'endroit possède un grand parking (ce qui est courant à Laval mais l'est franchement moins à Montréal).  En bref, je recommande à ceux qui cherchent une expérience pizza \" manifesta uno italiano \""}
{"text":"Today I went back to my fav (and only) pizza place in the city that I go to. It was a take out that I got. To my utter dismay the price went up! How can the price go up in a recession!?!?! Never the less I brought my fav pizza. I guess when it's the only place in town that the pizza is worth eating at, you gotta pay what you gotta pay."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Best real italian pizza I have had in Montreal!  Service was very good too and loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favourite pizza in Montreal.  They are just like what you find in Italy and the service is very good.  If you want to start with an appetizer then the meatballs are an excellent choice as is the melanzane (eggplant).  I usually get the pizza Siciliana which has eggplant on it or the Margherita and I highly recommend them both.  For dessert the tiramisu is always tasty.    You'll need to reserve for this place because it is ALWAYS packed.   I've been loads of times and they are always busy everytime I go."}
{"text":"Oh Bottega, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways!  I have been coming to Bottega for a long time because they make the best pizza in the city, no questions asked.  Pre-Bottega Montreal and its surrounding areas had been lacking a proper Neapolitan pizza but they changed that when they opened their first location in Little Italy a few years ago.  Of course it became so popular that the second one in Laval would soon follow.  Having experienced both Bottega locations, the Laval one is definitely my favourite.  The menu and quality of the food is the same at both.  The Laval location is bigger so it feels more spacious and I find it easy to get a reservation here even at the last minute.  Also in this location there is always plenty of parking available.  The menu is small and focused.  Pizza is the star here so while they have appetizers, or sfizi as they call them you should come here expecting to eat pizza as your main dish.  As far as the sfizi goes my personal favourites are the meatballs and the insalata caprese, which contains real mozzarella di bufala.  Now let's be clear on something.  They do Naples-style pizzas which means that they are simple and have only a handful of ingredients.  Don't worry though because while they may seem simple they are bursting with flavour.  They use a wood-burning oven which always gives the crust a nice, smoky taste that can't be reproduced in an electric oven.  They also use higher quality ingredients which of course makes for a tastier pizza.  The dessert menu is small but they do a good job with everything on it.  I'm a fan of their cannoli which always have a crunchy exterior while still being loaded with decadent ricotta filling.  Good cannoli are hard to find but Bottega gets it right.  The service here is generally pretty good with the occasional off night.  For the most part the food comes quickly.  The wait staff also knows the menu very well and can be counted on to make recommendations if you are unsure of what to order.  If you are looking for an amazing pizza that will remind you of what you get in Italy then this is the place.  I don't come to Bottega too often but I always enjoy myself when I do.  The restaurant is in a class of its own."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night one hour before closing. We initially wanted to go to mon lapin but there was a crazy lineup so we ended up here because it was close-by and there were quite a few empty tables.   I came here many years ago and I remember being disappointed. It was totally my fault though because against my better judgment I ordered the margarita pizza because it was the popular choice but I actually like  pizza with a lot of topics so I was disappointed.   For starters, my bf and I shared the arancini Bella Napoli which is a risotto ball with ham and mozzarella  inside. It was $5 for one!! Pretty pricy if you ask me! It wasn't huge or anything either. I liked that it was crunchy on the outside but I found there wasn't much cheese inside and it definitely was not melting. I also didn't see any ham. We also shared the veal meatball because the reviews on here pretty much all raved about it. My boyfriend and I were not impressed however. It was just like any other meatball with sauce on top. And again $5 for one meatball is pricy!   As for the pizza this time I knew better and we got a pizza with toppings! We chose the diavola which contained salami, tomatoes, mozzarella and chilli flakes. We also added sausage to it. The pizza  wasn't spicy like I thought it would be so we added some spicy oil which was really more of a paste and we added olive oil to the paste. I liked that the waiter offered to add toppings and asked me what I liked because I felt like he was catering the pizza to my taste and really cared. The pizza was good but some parts of my crust were burnt which was disappointing. It really depended on the slice because some parts of the crust were good and I would dip it in the olive oil which made it even better but some parts were so burnt that I didn't want to eat it.   To me this place is decent but I've had better pizza elsewhere in Montreal and probably would not come back again."}
{"text":"Tout simplement la meilleure pizza napolitaine de Montréal! Regarder le pizzaïolo enfourner les pizzas pendant quelques secondes est un pur régal!"}
{"text":"Bonne pizza dans un beau cadre dans la Petite-Italie. Jeudi 20h30, restaurant rempli + terrasse extérieure remplie, heureusement que j'avais réservé via une application de réservation. Beau cadre intérieur, ambiance italienne sympa dans la Petite Italie. En entrée, salade d'endive 10$, légère, plat principal, pizza  Diavola 15$, une des meilleures pizzas sur feu de bois que j'ai mangé. Prix corrects. Service ok. Client satisfait, j'y retournerai sûrement.   4/5 visité en août 2015."}
{"text":"Pizza is nothing like Italy.... It feels like a poorly cooked pancake batter. (Very difficult to digest!) However, the appetizers are truly excellent and so is the gelato. Staff is nice and polite!"}
{"text":"Bottega, you are OH SO YUMMY! I work close to this restaurant so i've already come to eat here a few times. The place can get busy in the evenings, so be sure to reserve! I can vouch for their delicious arancinis, meatballs and margherita pizza! I think their pizza is the best i've ever had. The dough is so so tasty and everything is made with love. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere so it's perfect for birthdays/special occassions. DEFINATELY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great and the service was good. Where Bottega fell short was in their execution. Meals were slow to arrive. Being polite, we waited until everyone had their meal but the delay was ridiculously long. The pizza itself was nothing spectacular. The water buffalo mozzarella was kind of nice but was done a disservice by the overcooked crust and bland sauce. To me it was all the signs of a rushed kitchen that just couldn't hack the pressure. I'd normally brush it off and say I'll be back to try it on a less crowded night but with their pricing, I don't know.   Bottom line: When you charge $18 for a personal cheese pizza your game better be tight!!!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant last night and it's times like that I'm thankful for yelp app. This place is absolutely fantastic and I'd never tried Portuguese BBQ before. Best chicken for sure and the rice was very tasty. All food is prepped right in front of you and service was top notch."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 2 people on a Saturday night, and thank God! It was Very packed. But such a surprise to find an authentic place like this in Laval! The pizza was amaaazing and the tiramisu, even better!!"}
{"text":"Last night was perfect to eat outside. Professional service, real Italian experience, delicious food. I had the bread, prosciutto and figues. Surprisingly, good size for an appetizer! Then I had the calzone. Italian beer to complète that very nice meal.  Service impeccable malgré la rue bruyante ; tables invitantes à l'extérieur comme à l'intérieur. Les prix sont raisonnables et les assiettes généreuses, surtout l'entrée pain, prosciutto et figues : un délice !"}
{"text":"Sérieux, je ne plaisante pas, j'ai essayé d'aller à ce restaurant à trois reprises.  À chaque fois, il était fermé!!! Je vous averti, vérifiez bien les heures d'ouvertures avant de vous y rendre.  Je n'ai pas été à l'original sur St-Zotique mais oh combien j'en ai entendu parler! La Bottega à Laval ressemblerait à n'importe quelle autre chaines de restaurant. Le décor ressemble beaucoup à ceux de ses voisins Ben & Florentine et Boccacinos.  Cependant, on peut y apercevoir un four à bois à l'intérieur, toujours un bon signe pour un resto de pizza ;)  L'attente a été longue même s'il y avait quand même plusieurs places de disponibles.  Et les tables sont quand même très rapprochées les unes des autres alors pas trop d'intimité.  Mais mis à part ces détails, la nourriture était absolument top notch! J'étais si ravie de retrouver le Burrata sur leur tableau de spéciaux! Ce fromage frais est très difficile à trouver à Montréal puisqu'il doit être consommé dans les 48 heures qu'il est fabriqué et il n'est fabriqué qu'en Italie :O La pizza, la plus simple qu'il peut y avoir, la margherita, brillait par la fraicheur des ingrédients et la pâte qui était tout simplement parfaite.  Un bon goût de beurre, bien croustillante, cette pâte à pizza était une des meilleures que j'ai goûtées! Combinés avec la sauce tomate un peu acidulée, le fromage mozarella en rondelle et les quelques feuilles de basilic, j'ai vécu un moment de pure bonheur! Les gnocchis étaient également délicieuses et tendres!  Pour les dents sucrés, ils ont un bar à gelato avec plusieurs saveurs intéressantes!  Somme toute, j'ai absolument adoré la bouffe! Le service et la location pourraient être sujets à amélioration. J'ai hâte d'essayer celui sur St-Zotique :)"}
{"text":"After eating there 8 years ago,  I returned last night. The place was quite packed for a Tuesday night at 9 pm!  Overall, I was expecting an above average experience but unfortunately it was very average.   The night began with our waiter being extremely pushy for us to order drinks and appetizers the second we got there. Then, inquired to make a slight change to my pizza by replacing the prosciutto with salami or pepperoni and they wanted to charge me $3 extra. As well, i wanted to have tomato sauce instead of white sauce and they charge extra for that as well. Basically, you know where this is going, any slight replacement wIll cost  you.. I wasn't too impressed since their pizzas aren't exactly cheap and they feel like they have the right to charge  a supplementary fee for any change....  In terms of the pizza, I felt like they cheaped out on the toppings and the presentation- see pics. The vegetables didn't look too alive and appetizing.   I will give them some credit for their tomato sauce and dough which was quite good. However overall I wasn't impressed and I wouldn't go back unless someone really insisted to go there."}
