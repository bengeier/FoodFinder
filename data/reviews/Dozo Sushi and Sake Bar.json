{"text":"Complete dining experience with superb service food, presentation, and unique gourmet selections.

One can order individual items from the menu, or do a set menu. We did the former. 

A romantic date place for sure. Darkly lit, and just the right amount of accent lighting.

{"text":"The appearance draws you in making you think you're going to have a nice dinner experience.  We were visiting from Chicago and we were looking for some good sushi.  I was dinning with two friends and one of them eats at McDonald's regularly so his udon was the greatest thing EVER!   The rest of us didn't get what we ordered. Actually we did get it but..... we wish we didn't!  I understand that this place was designed to give customers a nice dinning experience but REALLY.    Nice concept, sushi with a modern twist with bad food ....doesn't work for me.  I would rather eat a McDonald's before going back to this place.  That really doesn't  say much because I think McDonald's is pretty nasty.  I don't recommend this place if you're used the good quality sushi.  No wonder this place isn't busy at all.  Sushi lovers beware!"}
{"text":"Surprise this place is not busier....good food + trendy atmosphere. Ordered the Dozo Makimono and Tuna paper roll. Enjoyed both dishes ~ The interior design makes me feel like I am at a hip lounge while enjoying traditional sushi with a modern twist."}
{"text":"As of Sep 24, 2011, DOZO was out of business.  It had been renamed and being under new management.  New restaurant will be reviewed on yelp."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend & really enjoyed our din! We had quality service & the food came quickly. There was A LOT of food. In the end we had to pack it. We also ordered rolls which was quite silly cuz the set dinner was already insane !

We ordered the 8 course dinner. Mine was the chicken teriyaki (comes w/ all the things Jennifer K mentioned) and just under $20. 

The manager Allen also gave my family a salad on the house! So nice :D

Presentation was excellent and decor/ atmosphere too. But it is surprisngly empty for such a posh looking place! I can't wait to come back again! Prob good for bday bash imho!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  I used to come here for bubble tea with friends, because go for tea was always packed on weekends.  Recently tried their AYCE sushi and was surprised at how good it was.  Because this place is a little less known, the waitresses are very attentive to your needs.  I like the ambiance of this place too, it's dark and trendy...for a AYCE place, this is very unique, as most other AYCE sushi places I have been to are usually decrepit looking."}
{"text":"Why a decent Japanese place has to turn AYCE?! 

Dozo Sushi though has it regular a la carte and the set dinner menu and now you has a choice of AYCE. 

We are a group of 16 and if one want to do AYCE ($27.99), all have no choice to opt for AYCE..... Yes $28 plus taxes and tips! 

Food quality and presentation and services all went downhill when with a big group trying to order all kind of food from the menu. 

I was disappointed... and the selections on the AYCE is quite boring... nothing really excited me at least. 

A lot of time the food were lukewarm by the time it being served to us... 

Service was so so... but I understand it is not easy to serve a big group. At least there are no automatic 10% tips charged and they accepts credit card. 

Closed at 10 pm now... so we were kind of got the hint and leave.....

Dozo with the introduction of the AYCE menu becomes another one of those faceless AYCE sushi joint where quantity is more important quality!"}
