{"text":"I have been looking for a good Chinese restraint for lunch near work. This one fits the bill perfectly."}
{"text":"First, what you need to know about what makes Hot Wok great is that the owners are from Flushing, NY.  Now, if you're asking what that has to do with Chinese food, then you are obviously not from NY!  Here in Arizona, there are many restaurants that serve Chinese food, but NY style Chinese food is just different.  Well, if NY style is what you're looking for, then Hot Wok will satisfy that craving you're having!  I'll confess, I wasn't expecting much when I placed my first order.  So many other Chinese food eateries had disappointed me already, and I'd become jaded.  I think I first found them from having a menu left on my front security door.  Anyway, I remember being surprised to see scallion pancakes on the menu.  Hmmm, I thought, scallion pancakes?  This was the first time I'd seen them on a menu here in the valley....  Since then, I've been impressed with every order.  Yes, the scallion pancakes rock!  So do the egg rolls, spareribs, won tons, dumplings, and cold sesame noodles.  But that's just the appetizers!  There's plenty of entrees on the menu too, and none of them disappoint.  And of course, they have fresh mustard if you ask (so much better than those packages of hot mustard)  Now, if you're seeking ambiance, this place isn't for you.  When you walk in from the strip mall, there are some tables and chairs to either side of your path to the counter.  The decor is kind of plain.  Yes, you can eat here, but it's more of a takeout joint (in my own, humble opinion of course)  This is my number one choice for Chinese style comfort food....at its New York style finest!"}
{"text":"Won ton soup in some \"dark broth\" the won ton itself was very undercooked,  with the \"mystery meat\" inside. Fried rice was not fluffy and lioked like it had been soaking in its juices. Taste on 0-10...maybe a 3. Pepper steak: Requested \"spicy\". No added spice. Soggy green pepper and onions...no crunch at all. Meat flavor was rated at 6. Put the wrong rice on the wrong entry and when i brought to their attention there was yelling going on in the kitchen. Luke warm food temperature."}
{"text":"Another stop on my search for the perfect sesame chicken. The woman at the counter was soooo friendly that I was really rooting for this to be the place even though it was a drive. Unfortunately it was over breaded. Also ordered orange chicken, which was ok. Overall, was decent but not worth the drive."}
{"text":"The waitress snezed while holding my order in her hand, then lied to me about it when I confronted her. Also awhile ago I saw a huge cockroche run across the top of t he freezer they had up behind the counter. I give up on them no more."}
{"text":"We ate here a coulpe of days ago and were quite satisfied. It is sparkeling clean with a very friendly attentive staff.  We ordered:  Hot and souer soup which was just allright, some what lacking in taste. Hunan Chicken, very good and spicy as it should be. Nice medly of chicken and vegetables. Kung Pow Chicken, again spicy as it should be. A mixture of chicken and vegetables, a little heavy on the baby corn."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp because it was close by. Man oh man was the food good! I ordered the orange chicken with fried rice and egg drop soup. Luckily we made it before the lunch service ended which was 3pm. My husband ordered mandarin chicken with the same sides as myself. Everything was great. Egg drop soup was excellent! Looks like people do take out more than dining in. Great food, great prices and quick service."}
{"text":"The egg drop \"pudding\" was so nasty, the egg roll was un delicious...the amazing chicken was not...plus the people were not personable! I can remember when service was the last thing you expected in a Chinese restaurant. But, these restaurants have come a long way and for this place to carry themselves like they are the only operation in town or to behave like there food is actually good...when the restaurant was empty during lunch time...is embarrassing...dont waste your time or money"}
{"text":"The absolutely BEST Chinese food in Arizona! That's from a native New Yorker from Flushing. You can't beat the quality of the food, and they give you healthy portions sure to satisfy the pickiest eater."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall type of place is reasonable in pricing n fresh food. Their won ton soup is great. Their lo mein is good too they even deliver.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"The family meal is priced amazingly, the combo plates are a very nice bang for your buck, and the crab/cream cheese rangoons are addicting!!! My family and I have ordered a variety of take out for dinner, and we have also ordered in when we had company. The quality is fantastic and they will adjust your order if you just ask, or for a small upcharge, depending. They are always very friendly over the phone, and in person when I've picked up my orders. Delivery times are usually way quicker than quoted, but I do currently live close to the restaurant. The food is always piping hot and fresh no matter if I pick up or it's delivered.  Hot wok is definately my go to place when I'm craving great take out!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering deliveries at least twice a month from this place for the last 8 years. I must admit that lately the quality of the food has gone a bit downhill. It is still the best Chinese we have had in Az but that isn't saying much since every other place we tried was gross. The food is still OK but not as great as it once was. They changed the sauce for the dumplings making it spicier and the dumplings, one of my favorite foods, haven't been good lately either. I will say that, although the size has shrunk, the egg rolls here are still the best. They are real egg rolls, not spring rolls. I also like the wonton soup and the Lake Tung Ting Shrimp. They do use large shrimp and it isn't just three or four pieces. My husband loves their roast pork with broccoli but has agreed that lately it hasn't been as great. Hopefully they will go back to serving better food because I really did love it there for a long time."}
{"text":"My husband and I called in to place a $60 order.  We had a coupon for free ragoons and told them over the phone. They asked how we would pay and we stated debit. Upon arrival and paying with debit they  ripped open our bags, went through our bags, grabbed the ragoons and stated they were only for cash customers.  They left our food a mess. My husband asked to see a manager. They stated no manger was available and threw our bags at us, landing on the floor in a $60 mess! Deplorable!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Hot Wok tonight.  This was really bad.  No flavor at all.  I added soy, and sweet and sour but nothing.  Spring rolls were even worse.  They gave me with dinner wontons and all they were was stale crunch.  I really don't think they had anything in them and they were chewy not crunchy.  Skip, skip, skip is all I can say.  I gave it one because the young man at the front was very nice and polite."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I ordered sesame chicken, rice and bbq pork slices. At first taste everything was fine but when I chewed into my sesame chicken I found a wire inside of it. I called immediately after and asked for a refund. They first said \"okay do you want $5 off?\" To which I replied no, he then went on to offer a new plate be sent out to which I again insisted on a refund due to the curiosity I had about the other pieces. A few minutes later a gentleman calls us back to ask us to give the food back. We agree and wait 30 mins fir a man to return and take the chicken back, along with the wire incrested chicken piece.  About 15 minutes later another gentleman calls us asking if they can charge our card for the other items on the order. If you ask me, this place is a disgrace. They offer you coulons in place of real customer service. I could only imagine if my 9 year old son would have tried that piece and chocked...Maybe the inconsiderate gentleman that work there would have offered $20 off next purchase? Pffft disgraceful!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and it wasn't the best. I would have gone somewhere else like panda express and got better food for the price."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch on a whim because it was nearby and my coworkers and I wanted Chinese food. When we first walked in it was quite warm and humid, like the AC wasn't working properly. Even the girl taking orders was fanning herself. They charge extra .25 for sweet and sour sauce, they don't have any napkins present, you have to ask for them, as they are behind the counter and there is no self serve drinks, everything is bottled or canned. We all ordered the lunch specials, General tsos chicken with rice, a wonton soup and egg roll. The soup came out first. It looked okay, but it wasn't hot, just warm. Then the entrees came out and they looked amazing, but we soon figured out all the meat was fatty, dark meat. It was really hard to eat. We didn't see the option for white or dark meat on the menu. All of us prefer white meat, but we tried to eat the chicken as we were all super starving. We didn't ask if that's all they had or get it remade because we had to get back to work. I also ordered the crab rangoons, which were really good. Overall, none of us would go back to this restaurant because of the meat issue."}
{"text":"Tiny little hole-in-the-wall place with nice people, good prices, consistent quality, tasty meals!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Very good food. You can see into the kitchen. General Tso chicken was done to perfection. Very good sauce.  Pork fried rice similar to everywhere else. Lunch special comes with can of pop or bottle of water."}
{"text":"FOOD CONSUMER BEWARE!!! This is literally the worst Chinese restaurant I have EVER dined at!!! For starters the customer experience in store was atrocious they were rude and yelled at me as a first time customer never being in store. The, \"hostess\" could care less about the customer wanting me only to pay them and get out of my store. As for the food its INGREDIENTS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CHEAPER was TERRIBLY SMALL PORTIONS and GROSSLY OVERPRICED when they ultimately gave me the wrong food they refused to fix it for me and made me put to be the bad guy. Wouldn't recommend this store to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Don't know what's happened to this place, but I ordered Kung pao chicken & pork last night (delivered to my home), and it was horrible! Not one piece of chicken was in the dish, only deep fried breading! Totally inedible!  The pork was like deep fried shoe strings, also totally inedible!  I will never order from here again! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow if you are into New York style Chinese food this is definitely the place for you dishes are fresh meats are juicy shrimp are juicy it's basically it take out places they do have some tables it was quite delightful it was clean not much choice of sodas or iced tea but the food here is well worth coming prices are well worth it the amount of food on your plate is tremendous would highly recommend this place to those who crave New York style Chinese"}
{"text":"We've ordered from this place many times, but the last time was the first time we got delivery. Sunday evening , right at dinner time, and we got our food incredibly quick.  The wonton soup is amazing...probably one of the best I've had. It's fairly reasonable too. The sweet and sour chicken is my girl's favorite and the general tso's is also one of our favorites. This last time I ordered we also got a small order off roast pork lo mein (in case it was horrible). It was really good and I'll be ordering a large next time."}
{"text":"The food is barely above edible. And the service is awful. Last month we placed an order for delivery & got quoted at 40 mins. After ONE HOUR had passed and we hadn't received it yet we called and spoke with Kate. She assured us that our food was coming they were \"just very busy.\" Another 45 mins later, still no food. I called again and spoke with Kate. I told her that I no longer wanted the food, that 1hour 45 mins for delivery is ridiculous for a place that is 6 miles from our house. She didn't even apologize and continued to just tell me they were \"very busy\". She explained that the driver was already in route but our Credit Card would not be charged. She in fact, DID charge my Credit card. We will never be doing business with this place again."}
{"text":"The shrimp toast was burnt and disgusting, orange chicken too sticky, chicken fried rice was good as was the mushroom egg fo young.  In totality I won't order from Hot Wok again....and it was way expensive"}
{"text":"The worst service I've experienced! The cashier practically screamed while attempting to take my order. While I waited for my meal, I overheard the cashier taking a phone order. She was yelling at the person on the phone... as a couple was waiting to have their order taken. Nevertheless, I did not finish my meal due to the taste and texture of the meat. I complained about the meal, and the cashier began to yell at me. I simply asked her to lower the tone and volume of her voice, and left the restaurant. I will never come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Best for take out.  They deliver too.  Yummy yummy food. Wonderful service staff.  Prices are fair and inexpensive.  Love the food."}
{"text":"I ordered quite a few things from their menu tonight. The beef with broccoli was perfect, broccoli was cooked evenly and there was a great amount of beef to go along with it. I also ordered the sweet & sour chicken as this was a favorite in our house, it came with a large amount of chicken and more than enough sauce to cover everything I ordered (this was a great thing to have since everyone loves this stuff). I had also ordered the teriyaki chicken lo mien, the chicken was cut into small to medium chunks with large noodles, the flavor mixture between the noodles and the chicken was great. The hot & sour soup was perfect, not to spicy, full of flavor. Appetizers we ordered, shrimp toast and pan fried dumplings. The shrimp toast was perfectly cooked, crispy outside with a warm full center with the great shrimp flavor. The dumplings were just as well cooked, perfectly fried and crispy on the edges and warm full center.  If you're looking for great food, I say give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery on 2/17. Husband and I started feeling sick on Sunday 2/19, began vommitting that night and this morning. Called restaurant to talk to a manger, but he is \"on vacation\" so we spoke with a rep named \"Maggie\" who told us that chinese food doesnt last longer than a day and its our fault for not finishing food by Sat afternoon. I stated that this food should last longer than a day if it's made fresh. Maggie denied by statements by stating that the soup wouldnt last. I ate no soup, but that didnt stop her from denying that food was fresh and but still doesnt last more than a day. I told Maggie I didnt want a refund, a credit, or a redo. I just wanted to let them know they are losing a good customer due to the poinsoning and that they are being reported to the health department. GO ELSEWHERE!"}
{"text":"Tried several different items on this menu on three different occasions and last night was the END of my relationship with this eatery. I kid you not, my daughter actually gagged on her piece of chicken and it was clear why. Smelled really bad (and we ate IN) and so heavily sauced with this thick goo and overfried and overpriced...argh.  I love food and it's actually sort of hard to really make me despise eating out but, please, save your money and your gag reflex and DO NOT EAT here. I can't believe it's still in business. WHERE IS THE GOOD CHINESE AROUND HERE? Wah."}
{"text":"They have a large selection of lunch specials for cheap. Large servings with choice of white/brown/fried rice plus soup, egg roll, or soda. Tso's chicken was very tasty. My only complaint is it was warm and stuffy inside, so it's better to pick-up from than dine-in."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars I would. SUPER RUDE WORKERS. There is a $5 minimum and I work for Postmates and one of my customers ordered from here. So I went to Pick up he order and explained that this is for a customer and I only have a Postmates card. THIS LADY GAVE ME STRAIGHT ATTITUDE. I even politely said thank you for the order when she set it down without letting me know it was done and walked away and she never said a word after that. I highly recommend not going there"}
{"text":"I have been spent 2 years trying to find a good Chinese restaurant in Mesa, this place is the winner in my opinion! Super friendly person who took my order as well as a very friendly driver. Food was delivered in less than a half hour, and was AMAZING! I am extremely picky about Chinese food so if I like it, that's saying a lot! I also really appreciated that their delivery minimum was only 10.00. I hate when I have to order a bunch of food I don't want to meet a pricy minimum. Really really impressed with hot wok!"}
{"text":"This place is actually a really nice hole in the wall Chinese food restaurant. It actually has a vegan menu and they are willing to cater to vegan options. I had an orange tofu and it was great better than this place I go to in Tempe! Great food"}
{"text":"I was on lunch break, looking for an actual restaurant versus gut destroying fast food. Found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. I was greeted and shown where sauces and utensils were since it was my first time here. The joint is clean and inviting, nice and lit. Open spaces. I got the shrimp in garlic sauce and hot and sour soup. YUMMY! All of it. Totally coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"If the bathrooms are gross...I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like. Didn't even eat here because the restrooms were so gross."}
{"text":"Apparently I am on their do not deliver list cause I've only ever ordered once. Called today, the lady that answered repeated my address to me and just started saying hello I can't hear you. 3 more attempts the same thing. Fucked up customer service."}
{"text":"After reading these reviews, we gave it a shot because we were craving Chinese and didn't wanna go anywhere. We ended up getting one of the family meals...for the price, tons of food! And it was good stuff too. Definitely gonna try out some other items next time."}
{"text":"This place is a small location.  You walk up and order (even after I asked if I could dine in, the cashier asked if the order was for to go...).  The cashier wasn't rude, but did not seem genuinely thrilled that I wanted to order or eat there.  And, there was someone laying their head on the table right as you walk in, probably one of the worker's teenage kids... That's always inviting.  All their sauces are packets in 3 tier plastic drawer.  The plastic utensils are there too and a package of napkins on top.  They do offer real utensils, but I felt safer using the plastic utensils.  I ordered an egg roll that was suppose to have bbq pork (which was neon pink) inside with cabbage mix (I think they bought the coleslaw mix).  However, it was crispy fried, but forgettable.  I decided to try the House Crispy Pork.  It was deep fried well and sautéed in a red spicy sauce (maybe bottled sweet Chili sauce, mixed with a little tomato paste or ketchup) and garnished with 6 pieces of broccoli crown pieces.  This meal was ok.  But, I did notice that they offer various pan fried noodle dishes, which is not all that common in these restaurants, so I might be willing to try that if I ever find myself in the area or going there."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, hot and sour soup, pork egg rolls, butter coconut chicken, and garlic chicken.  The lady on the phone told me there was a $3 delivery charge and a $20 minimum for delivery, which I appreciate knowing right off the bat.  The soup had a deep fried food kind of taste, but I still liked it.  The egg rolls were awesome, and both entrees were really good too.  I was quite impressed and ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"Better than panda! Usually when people post a review it's to talk bad about a place. I just went threw registered with Yelp just so I could say this this food is bomb! The cream cheese puff ragoon what ever you call them are the very best I've ever had! The orange chicken and broccoli and beef were perfect. Usually when I order the broccoli and beef it's chewy and more  broccoli than beef but not in this case it was beefy yummy goodness! Price was under 30$ with tip and we had leftovers. The egg drop soup was perfect too and did not smell like funk like most places. I mean if you would take the time to review how awesome a places food is... That's how good this place is. It's like an  orgasim in your mouth :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to be perfectly honest.  Most of Hot Wok's allure is that it is super close to me, and they deliver.  The food is decent.  I've had much better, but then again, I've also had much worst.  The menu can be very hit or miss, so you just have to kind of take your chances with it.  But the prices are reasonable, and the service is quick.  The wonton soup and salt and pepper squid are two of my go-to dishes.  If you're in the area and want to give it a try...well, will it a be spectacular culinary experience?  Probably not.  Will you get an inexpensive, decent meal?  Yeah, I think so."}
{"text":"This is the first time ordering/eating here and after a long day at work it is perfect. I ordered delivery. The food arrived quicker than promised and was actually HOT. The driver was nice and so was the person that took my order. I'm very impressed by the service and food. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Awsome food could've easily been 5 stars but are very blunt and not so great with delivery service"}
{"text":"This is my go-to if I want take out near-by... Not Pew Wei, not Panda, this place. Lunch specials are a good deal. I've only ordered the boring American style dishes but it has all been freshly made, ready on time, as expected."}
{"text":"Update... Try this place a little over a year later and it still terrible.  First off the waitstaff was absolutely horrible super rude act like they were doing you a favor by taking your order as we walked in very unfriendly.  The Mongolian beef was terrible barely any beef and barely any flavor mainly vegetables also the crab Rangoon's were terrible old greasy just absolutely terrible. O for two. definitely will not be back and will not recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Chinese food. Ever since I found this place I haven't been any where else the staff is extremely friendly and the food is amazing. I usually get the teriyaki chicken and wonton soup and it's always hot and perfect. They deliver to me quite a ways away witch is awesome could have been happier to find this place."}
{"text":"We just ordered this for delivery last night. So good. We ordered the Pork Dumplings, Honey Chicken, Shredded Chicken Szechuan Style and the Moo Shu Pork. The Moo Shu Pork was delicious! We will order from here again!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time dinning in. I have tried their food before, and it wasn't so great. But today at dinning in, the lady who took our order was extremely rude, and would answer questions in an annoyed tone. Like before, food wasn't anything to go back for. Defiantly not going back."}
{"text":"Hot Wok and the Good and Bad Bad- can't understand lady when you order  Good- the hot wings and fries are bomb"}
{"text":"Just remembered why I don't order from here . Food took over an hour to deliver - I live down the street but was hosting a small bday get together . They lied and tried to say their was traffic - I don't even live a mile away !! Customer service is always attitude. Food isn't the best either ! Ordered here twice . Tonight was the last time ."}
{"text":"Sesame beef.  I was supposed to be spicy...it wasn't.  Instead of spice it was too sweet.  Moo shu pork was served with old stale pancakes.  Egg rolls were good...other wise meal was disappointing."}
{"text":"Average at best. Better for take out than dine-in. The dining room is counter service only. Drinks are limited to bottled water and soda in cans. The sauces were very pedestrian."}
