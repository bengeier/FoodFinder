{"text":"The large cornbeef sandwich with the kaiser bun was amazing... the cabbage roll was huge but too sweet.. the chicken noodle soup had good flavor but no chicken.. just noodles.. 5 stars just for the cornbeef..."}
{"text":"First time having their sandwich after years of passing the place on the bus. Never again will I eat there. For $9.00, the sandwich did have a lot of meat, but no taste and they didn't even have cheese."}
{"text":"This place has yet to get a review!! Wow! Love this place, simple, simple. Grab your tray & get in line for the Best Corned Beef in Canada. This might not feel like a traditional delicatessen but the flavour is all there. It is cafeteria style, help yourself to the items available. Various salads and small side items, I recommend the pickles. The main event is Corn Beef of rye, don't be fooled. You need to order properly, decide are you a lean freak? Or want flavour....yes i'm meant fat!! So order your sandwich accordingly, Lean, Medium, fatty or xtra fatty. I find the medium is the right combination.  Don't forget to get a bowl of soup!!! Family has been coming here since the doors opened, Always coming back for more!"}
{"text":"A month after being in Montreal and having my first ever Montreal smoked meat sandwich at Swartz, the craving came back which led me to this restaurant.  The comparison between these 2 are day and night.  First off, this place was a little confusing to find because the sign on the road was in between 2 plazas and we wandered into the wrong area. This place is very overpriced for a sandwich, and both the meat and bread was very dry.  They try to solve this by putting lots of mustard, personally this just doesn't work. The atmosphere is very nice, lots of parking spots and a self serve dine-in with plenty of tables.  A great place to take make a stop after a long shop at Yorkdale or Orfus road.  Overall had a decent experience here, you would defineately need to come here to try it out if you never had a smoked meat sandwich before."}
{"text":"Amazing roasted beef and corned beef. Portions are huge and definitely an interesting place to go with friends and family. Price is fair, and I love their cherry coke.  I just wish their kaisers was better quality, but even with that flaw you should walk away happy."}
{"text":"You get a very generous portion of meat for each sandwich. The meat was cooked perfectly. I ordered a sandwich with a side of the coleslaw (in a vinegar dressing). Couldn't finish my food so I asked for a take out box. The women behind the counter gave me one box so I asked for a second one (I didn't want the vinegar to soak into the onion bun and mess up my 12 dollar sandwich). She actually rolled her eyes and threw the second box onto the counter for me to pick up. For a lunch that cost me 17 dollars, in a canteen style restaurant, and to have attitude given to me over a 5 cent box, you bet I wont be back here."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The corned beef sandwich their signature dish is bland and has way too much fat on the meat. For $10 for the sandwich (no combo) you're better off walking to a pub and ordering a corned beef sandwich there."}
{"text":"For smoked meat/corned beef/pastrami cravings while you're in toronto this place is pretty good.   After eating at Carnegie deli I really craved some corned beef and chicken liver. So off to katz I went for the first time.   I didn't know this place was cafeteria style so I'm happy it wasn't busy when I came. Otherwise there would be some annoyed regulars staring me down.   I got the chopped liver... It kind of freaked me out that they leave chopped liver on a plate out in the open (its on ice). Still I was craving some and alas... It would have to do. Doesn't that stuff go bad easily? It didn't seem very safe to have it sitting out exposed with the chicken salad ad tuna salad and egg salad.  Either way.. It was pretty tasty. The slight stomach ache that followed might have been caused by this, but I'm not completely sure.   Corned beef was delicious... Just a little too fatty and not as much taste as Carnegie deli. But that's like trying to compare a Toyota to a lexus.... It's a car... But just in two different classes.   smoked meat was a little dry for my liking... But again.... If we are to compare this to real Montreal smoked meat.... Well it's just not fair to do so!"}
{"text":"I have never given a one star review. However, this place earned it. +$10 for a small sandwich. The guy didn't wear any gloves. The bread was ok. There was a lot of meat but nothing to write home about. The tables were all greasy. Not going back."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, the owner was completely rude. Will go elsewhere for mediocre overpriced sandwiches"}
{"text":"A great pastrami sandwich on an onion bun and a fries and gravy for the side. This'll run you $15-$17. Pricey, but this is Toronto."}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing. It was our first time there and they provided us with samples of the different types of deli. My advice: go for the Pastrami. Delicious and tender. Also go for the regular meat platter; you get more meat for the same price as a sandwich."}
{"text":"Best corn beef sandwich in Toronto.  Make sure you also order their chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! A good friend of mine from Israel used to be a manager there about 10 years ago. He keeps telling me how great this place is...how this family-owned business is so ethical and how their standards are so high. So I decided to stop by and try it out when I was in Toronto last summer. There is nothing like it here in Atlanta. Everything was fantastic. You can tell all the food is homemade and made from scratch! I especially liked the corned beef and pastrami -- both were delicious. You should also try the french fries with gravy...sooooo good! I hate that I didn't take a picture, but the photos on here are making my mouth water now."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Katz's from NYC...although I do wonder why it's called the same name.    Anyhoo-lots of meat on soft bread, delicious sweet hot mustard (buy some to take home like we do to put on our own homemade creations), greasy knishes (I could only eat half before feeling like my face was gonna break out in a massive acne outbreak), and over mayo'd sides like coleslaw, mac salad and potato salad.  So skip all of that, and just order a sandwich to go.   PS  If you don't feel like red meat that day, ask for turkey.  It's not on the menu, but they do have it."}
{"text":"I love cats its always amazing when you get a big Sanders with tons of meat on it you can't go wrong. I love the corn beef on rye or pastrami hell I can't make up my mind their all good"}
{"text":"Too expensive and the food just ain't that good.   Meat was cold and the latke was microwaved soggy."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. It was extremely unorganized, hard to get a table. They yelled at us for sitting in the wrong section by accident. Extremely overpriced, $20 for a sandwich, was not worth it. It was just okay. I've had better, for less. The creamy coleslaw was swimming in sauce, didn't even want to finish it. The pickles were good."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES I've heard a lot about Katz's over the years but never had the chance to sample until last week. What can I say? I was disappointed.   MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Seeing as it's a \"Corned Beef Emporium\" I figured I'd get the corned beef. Wow was it bland and dry. I'll say this about the sandwich - it's big (see pics). I just found the meat itself to be bland. Like Steven Harper bland. At least it doesn't cheer for the Senators. Easily the most disappointing corned beef in Toronto, but surely not the worst. I just have high expectations when it comes to deli meat.  SERVICE NOTES I got my sandwich to go and the wait was pretty much the exact amount of time I'd like to wait for a sandwich. Long enough to figure they're making the sandwich properly and fresh but not so long as to annoy me.   LOCATION NOTES If it wasn't for the massive signs you'd surely miss this joint. On the west side of Dufferin at Orfus. Inside it's a cafeteria-style setup.   HUMOUROUS STORY I got nothing. That dry, bland piece of shit sandwich zapped all the funny out of me."}
{"text":"Sigh.  I wanted to love this place... I've given them several tries and am sad to report that the only thing in common with THE Katz's Del (of New York City fame) is a name and a highly diluted culinary cultural heritage.    This is a cafeteria style deli that has all the right items on the menu - but they're all done wrong.  Perhaps I should say  RE-done wrong.  Microwaved Latkes? (potato pancakes) Are you kidding me?  Nuking a latke is tantamount to nuking a double espresso - both are culinary hate crimes of the highest order.  These should be punishable by a one month sentence of nothing but pizza-pizza.    The corned beef is certainly edible, but lacks the flavour and pop of the good stuff.  Frankly, it tasted a bit old - the steaming here seemed designed for longevity enhancement rather than flavour.  The smoked meat is mega-meh - just go get some at Costco if this quality is sufficient for you.    Aside from the garish design of the space (I'm all for re-purposing, but this IS supposed to be a deli...) the place has a whiff of authenticity.  There are just better choices in the GTA"}
{"text":"Whats with the weirdo at cash?? Super strange vibes. Other than that food and service everywhere else is pretty good and don't really have any complaints there. Just honestly I always have to think about paying before hand because the guy at cash is always weird and predatory. Has made strange comments toward my mom and also just is overall weird."}
{"text":"If you're eating in, start in the cafeteria-style lineup, grab a plastic tray, and load it with side plates of whatever you fancy (pickles, salads, drinks, etc.) and order your sandwich or meat plate from the deli folks in the middle of the line.  After you've checked out with the cashier, pick a spot at any of the granite-topped diner tables, which were about half full when we went on Saturday around noon.  I found my pastrami on rye to be OK.  Not the worst, not the best...just OK.  I had asked my pastrami to be cut from a fattier side of the meat, and while they happily and kindly obliged, it wasn't quite as moist as I'd hoped.  The rye bread was a bit dry too, so we were glad there was a squeeze bottle of mustard at every table.  Had a small plate of pickles, and again they were OK: not bad, but not very different than your average, grocery-store jarred pickle.  Basically, I found our experience at Katz's in general to be rather average."}
{"text":"I was in the west end doing some appts when I realized I had to get the kids some lunch and get back to the east end.  time 11am.    There was one lady in front  of me at the take out counter ordering a pound of smoke meat.  Two people on the deli slicers and two take-out people.  In the general eat-in line one couple.    I ordered two corn beef  on rye and one small potato salad $23.54, that is steep.    Now for the bad part.  The take out lady took a phone order and a girl who was obviously new was left to man the station.  Oh right it was just me one take out girl and two slicer guys to get it done.    I said I would be right back (had to go to the bathroom so bad too much water).  She wouldn't place the order until I paid. Ok fair enough,  had my interac card ready and willing she scanned it first without ringing it in. The she realized she needed to, it came to $43,956.34 more training on the till.  She did this five times.  I did a shout out to miss busy on the phone who finally came back to the till, 6 people in line now.  She did a shout out to deli slicers that she can't work with this women (honestly she was very nice but very green not her fault).     After all of that I got the total and then told they don't take interac had to pay by visa.  20 minutes have gone by and my order not even place yet.  Finally get two sandwiches and over-priced dull potato salad ($5.80 for small you could feed a small village potato salad homemade at this price).  Ask for mustard packages, cutlery and serviettes.     Looked in bag before I left because everything so confusing.  No mustard had to ask again.  Sandwiches not cut in half, there is a generous portion of meat and they need to be cut in half.  Time is now 11:35am  The corn beef is very fatty ask for lean if you do go......I was there last summer after we had to get the kids from yorkdale after summer camp and it was shitty then.  I have no one to blame but myself....  Made it to the east end for 12:10, friggin construction on Lawrence killed me."}
{"text":"If you are craving Corned Beef, Knish, Latkes and Coleslaw, Katz Deli is a great place to go.   I stopped by Katz for lunch and indulged myself in corned beef on rye, pickles, coleslaw and black cherry cola. I was very pleased with the meal and enjoyed the quick cafeteria style line system. Unlimited refills on the cola made the meal combination that more authentic. The meat was piled high and the salad and pickle were fresh and tasty.   The location is easy to get to from the 401 or Yorkdale mall. Free parking in the provided lot."}
{"text":"My wife and I had to be in the area, so decided we'd try this 40-year corned beef institution for BREAKFAST.  Our advice?  Don't!  Unless you miss the atmosphere of your high school lunchroom in-between lunch periods, don't.  Unless you like tasteless, undercooked eggs and onions with onions that seem to have been sauteed a couple days before, don't.   Unless you like your rye toast slathered in Becel, don't.  Unliess you like your potato latke microwaved(!!!), soggy and devoid of potato, DON'T!  WARNING TO NON-JEWS - If you must have a latke here, do not judge all latkes by this version.  I'll make one for you, or alternately, rush down to Free Times Cafe on a Sunday morning.  So, as the Yelp Rating says, Eek!  Methinks not!"}
{"text":"After passing by this place for over 20 years, we decided to try it since a friend tried it last week.  It's a very large space.  You come in and it smells like corned beef.  My mom and I shared a corned beef sandwich, fries and a cabbage roll.  The fries are just okay, regular fries nothing special.  The sandwich was quite tasty and not too salty.  The cabbage roll was really nice.  We wanted some matzo ball soup but it's only available Fridays and Mondays.  3 stars because it was a tad pricey for what it is ($25, no drinks)."}
{"text":"I like Katz's because it's close to my office when I need my fix of cured beef and hot mustard.  It's my opinion that they could improve on their menu by allowing a choice of size (it seems their sandwiches only come in one, large size). Also, I do enjoy being able to request what fat level I receive on my sandwich. Perhaps they allow it here, but I've heard otherwise (reviews below). I also agree they could source a better baker for their buns as they're commonly dry.  But who am I to argue with an establishment with such longevity as Katz's?  I really don't have much to add to the other reviews but I had to get a deli review under my belt if only to share a Hedbergism:  \"I hate sandwiches at New York delis, too much fuckin' meat on the sandwich. It's like a cow with a cracker on either side. \"What would you like sir?\" \"A pastrami sandwich.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Yeah, a loaf of bread and some other people.\" ~ Mitch Hedberg  :)"}
{"text":"After i went my first time I had to bring my all family next and they loved it. Every time I go there I leave satisfied and full. I just love the atmosphere,the food is amazing and the cheesecake is so gooooooood..."}
{"text":"Great place just not like the ones in Montreal. I've met a client here at their request. Otherwise I wouldn't  bother."}
{"text":"Good food, clean, people are great and quality is consistent. I take friends by for a nice lunch, I especially like the tall glasses of un-sweetened Ice Tea. A nice touch when you want to watch sugar intake.  The soups and salads are always fresh and have that home made flavour."}
{"text":"The word \"average\" has negative connotations but in the case of Katz's, it's not a bad thing. Not all places are exceptional and not all places are horrible. Katz's is in the middle.   The restaurant is located on Dufferin street near Yorkdale. They have ample of parking spaces which is rare in this area. A Burger Priest and a Pizza Nova are besides them in an adjacent plaza.   It was our first time and I liked the Cafeteria style service and decor. You can select a salad or cake on display then go about ordering your choice of sandwich with either fries or soup. We went with a Smoked Meats Montreal Style on an Onion Bun while my wife chose the Rye bread. The meats were good, not the best but not the worst. We also chose the side of different salads along with a piece of cake. My suggestion will be to forego the sides. They are not good. The cake was stale as it was probably on the counter for a long time.   I think I would have loved this place if the prices were a bit more affordable. It was expensive for what we got. I think if you just come for the sandwiches, the prices are more reasonable and you get a better value. Don't order any sides.   Something to think about if you visit this place."}
{"text":"Let's be real for a minute. You re not coming to kat'z for a 4-star lunch. You re coming here for a 5-star experience because every step of the way you're greeted by lovely staff members, chefs, and customers.  The huge space is inhabited by lovely and mostly elderly (a good sign to stay) and obviously hungry people enjoying a break from work. While sitting we found ourselves in conversation with 3 different tables.   I came here for the first time with my friend and after a long morning hustling resulting with tired feet we left fully satisfied and a plan to come again.   We both got the Montreal-style smoked meat which seemed to be the favoured sandwich that day and MAN let me tell YOU HOW GOOD THIS WAS. If course it wasn't the best, but that doesn't warrant a terrible experience because it was GOOD -- the sandwiches were bigger than my face! The joy is honestly sinking your teeth into that meat for the first time.   TLDR: Lots of meat. Restaurant style. Plenty of conversation. 5/5. Would 100% come again."}
{"text":"Smoked meat, corned beef, beef tongue sandwiches on rye are all delicious.  The fries aren't bad if they're fresh.  The coffee, coleslaw and cheesecake are fine without standing out.  It's a counter-service place, so there's not much to say about the service.  The people who serve you at the counter are friendly, but it has very little to do with your overall stay.  The place is spacious, a little ugly, but you're going to a place like Katz' for the food, right?"}
{"text":"When I moved to Toronto I was delighted to find such a large Jewish population.  Coming from Seattle, I spent years going without two of my compatriots, Matzah Ball and Corned Beef.  Over the last year I've been to five or six of these places, and mostly under the close guidance of Shari M.   I happened to be out with my wife one fine Sunday afternoon when we drove by Katz's.  Assuming it to be similar to the famous on in NYC, we stopped in.  Now, I've never tasted ass but I have a very active imagination.  So yeah, my mountain of meat tasted similar to what I would expect ass to taste like.  Don't go here. Ungood."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a business trip and was so happy when my colleague suggested we go to a Jewish deli for lunch. I was overjoyed by Katz's cold salads, pickles, liverwurst, and hot the meat carvings. The cafeteria style setup is a delight when you're famished. No waiting is always a plus.   The food is fresh and plentiful. It's a deli, so of course the cold dishes are premade, and probably in large batches. They don't do half a sandwich so prepare to eat it, take half or share if you're a light eater. I opted to share it and also had cold pickles, split pea soup, and a nice strong iced tea.   The staff was helpful, friendly and cheerful. The décor is kitschy but I wasn't there for the ambiance. Sometimes when you're far away from home good company and good food is all you need.   If I'm ever in Toronto again, this California girl is coming back to Katz."}
{"text":"I was in town for business, staying at a nearby Holiday Inn. Yelp led me to Katz's, and I had a craving for a big ole' deli sammich. The place was easy to find, and was a short little walk from the hotel. It was uncrowded on a Monday evening, which is to be expected. The staff was friendly, and it's served cafeteria style, which I didn't mind. What I did mind, was the price. For a sammich, fries, and a cola, I was set back $17.75. That's honestly the biggest reason for the 2 star rating. The food quality was ok, but I've had MUCH better (and bigger) for MUCH less, even in NYC. I had the corned beef on rye. And while the meat is piled high, it's mostly a trick of the eyes, as the rye bread is cut very small. The fries and gravy were very much ordinary, and they have the smallest soda cups I've ever used. Granted, there were free refills, but you have to get up after every 4th or 5th bite just to refill your drink.   Bottom line: For the area of town Katz's is located, I would take your dollars elsewhere. I know I will for the next couple of nights."}
{"text":"Corned Beef is not as amazing as Schwartz, but it's a good substitute without driving all the way to Montreal - kind of kicks the cravings a bit.   Doesn't make you feel too filth but definitely fills you up. Only complaint is that the slices did feel a little too thin - it wasn't juicy. I like the amount they give you, but I'd like the meat to feel a bit chewier. Good amount of mustard though.   Pickles are super pickled/sour! And the coleslaw is good as well!   Liked it, but didn't love it."}
{"text":"there pastrami/ corned beef is good, they stack em pretty high and just  a lttle dry, cafeteria like, everything is ala carte, i usually get, a big pastrami sandwich on rye, fries and a piece of the rich chocolate cake, a vernors to wash it all down....gets busy a lunch, plenty of seating, a bit expensive , last time i went $9 bucks a sandwich (around there)...But this place has been around since i was a kid (dating myself) right across the  street from  yorkdale, easy access from the 401, right on dufferin....try it once a bet youll go back...."}
{"text":"Been by this place a countless number of times, so figured I had to give it a shot. My boyfriend and I went in, and were a little confused about where exactly to go haha! Luckily a really nice lady who worked there helped us through the system - Cafeteria Style! We each grabbed a tray and went up to tge counter to order our desired meals. It was cool to watch them slice the corned beef right in front of your, and construct a towering sandwich haha! I ordered corned beef on rye, and my boyfriend got the open faced roast beef sandwich with gravy on top and a side of fries. We also got a drink (which has free refills - defs one of my fave things ever). It was certainly difficult to eat my sandwich given the fact that it was about 4 or 5 inches high! It was simply a process of deconstruction,  and eating the sandwich in little sections haha - and Very tasty too! I put some mustard on it as well, and overall was satisfied.   There's plenty of seating too, so coming in with a large group is no worry."}
{"text":"Pretty good sized sandwiches and a plethora of meat. It amazes me that a plate of fries with gravy is more expensive than the sandwich. All the meat wss very tender and juicy."}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure how they kept up with the rent for this massive establishment on a huge parking lot but now I know.... the high price of this mediocre food.  The pastrami and corned beef sandwiches are filled and full with meat but not with flavour.  The guy that was cutting the meat and serving us had a huge cold sore on his lip that I couldn't help but look at.  I wouldn't have minded as much if he wore gloves while man-handling our meat and sandwiches... but he didn't, and THAT is sick.  Came to just about $30 for 2 sandwiches and a small drink.    Though I must say that they do offer FREE refills on their soft drinks.  And they are the only in the city that I've seen with this deliciously refreshing and fizzy grape/boysenberry drink in their fountain."}
{"text":"Drove by this place enough times and finally had to make the effort to try this place as I haven't had a CORNED BEEF sandwich for the longest time and the last time I had it was probably at Pickle Barrel and many many years ago at Druxy's.  It might help to note that this TRIP was actually for a pre-dinner snack around 4pm so traffic and patrons were limited to a few as it's neither the lunch or dinner rush that other reviewers have had their experience with.  I went in and got a little bit CONFUSED at first as there seemed to be different routes for this Cafeteria so I went straight... Straight to the washroom where I can wash my hands for the sandwich to follow.  As I walk back out I noticed some private rooms that had lights turned off and it looked kind of SAD and old in there, maybe it was because of the rainy day as well.  I looked through the SIDES counter where Mashed Potatoes, Cakes, Cole Slaws, etc were waiting for future patrons but not for me as I walked towards the SLICERS and asked for a Corn Beef on Rye($7.95).    The Sandwich was piled high as I took it from the nice gentlemen and went to the soup counter and asked for the Chicken Soup because I was curious why it's only available on Friday & Saturdays.  I took the Chicken Soup with the MATZO BALL option($4.10) and it was filled up to the top so much it overflowed to the serving dish underneath.  Went to the self-serve cutlery STATION and then took a seat in a setting that resembled an run-down old-style Mandarin restaurant.  Took a bite of the Corned Beef and it was A-OK and a good portion size and a bit JUICY otherwise known to you all as FATTY but I'm fine with it.  The Sandwich was topped with Mustard and I had Mustard Fingers the rest of the day.  No comment on the Matzo Ball as it was the first time having it, so I'll leave the commentary to other's that know their Matzo Ball from Dumplings.  The Chicken Soup was nothing unusual as well but I had it because I wasn't feel for a Cola of any type.  I wasn't over SALTY like others but it wasn't strong in flavour either, so it can go either way.  Successful A-OK Pre-dinner complete!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Tried the smoked meat lean  Lacked a little in seasoning but still tasty and nice if you are in the area.  Wouldn't return ever but that's not to say it's not worth a try."}
{"text":"Ok -- it's an expensive sandwich, but worth every cent.    I had lunch here and didn't need to eat dinner.    I've been eating deli my entire life, and a classic Toronto deli like Katz's brings me back to my childhood.    Every time I am in the area I come to visit.    What a sandwich -- a home run, hole in one, and a slam dunk all in one.    Thanks for spoiling me Katz, and fulfilling my deli craving."}
{"text":"A barn of a place. They have a unique high school cafeteria style self ordering counter. At most times this place is busy.  We both had the tongue, and liked it enough to go back a few more times. The sides are just that sides...although the French Fries are OK.  But I am loosing my tongue thinking about the one they serve. So moist and tasty. The bread that came with the tongue was fresh and you cannot ask for more.  And just for that I am giving it 3 Stars. We will come back."}
{"text":"Old school deli with older clientele. Huge quantities of delicious meat, but seems some get more meat than others. A bit on expensive side but we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Oy vey, this is some good deli food!  I have tried the Corned Beef, Pastrami and the Montreal Smoked meat. All are incredibly juicy and flavourful. These guys must go through a ton of the stuff, judging by the individual carving stations.   Just like an old high school cafeteria, you can select side dishes like pickles or shredded carrot and apple salad.  Check out the Banana Caramel cake--my teeth ached just looking at it!  While you can get meat platters, I generally opt for the sandwich, stacked high on rye with a good dose of mustard. Now, if the menu would only offer a Reuben..."}
{"text":"Super rude impatient unhelpful brunette girl at take out counter who was pushing from the second I looked at the menus   typical Toronto service , I could understand deli service if this was Montreal or New York but Toronto come on, be professional   On a good note , not greasy was ok but 20$?!?!?! Yikes not again"}
{"text":"Katz's is about as good as any true deli in the GTA. My deli favorite is either a corned beef on rye or a Reuben which is just modification of the same. The corned beef is fresh and delicious and piled on as you might be used to at, like I said, any true deli.  Katz's is really no better but certainly no worse than most other places. In the area, they're definitely the go-to place."}
{"text":"2 lines, take out or eat in when you enter. Smoked meat is very good. Sandwich maker completely ignored and bypassed me, bit annoying. Made mistake of ordering chicken noodle soup, which was 5 bucks and a small dish of only BROTH. nothing more... Nice big seating area available. Prices are the norm these days, about 10 bucks a sandwich."}
{"text":"I picked up some chicken and matzoh ball soup for some sickies and some deli meats for myself. the food was delicious and the counter help was courteous. The cashier checked our takeout order before handing it over and found that the kitchen had made an error, so she had them fix it. I didn't try the soup but it smelled and looked good. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly.  The place looked a bit run down.  The prices are a bit high. The sandwich was actually pretty good but I went to Schwartz's Deli in Montreal and i don't think they were as expensive as this place. Would I go back?  Most likely not.  There are many alternatives that provide better value and better product."}
{"text":"My first experience here probably won't be my last, although I wasn't overly impressed this visit. I had been craving smoked meat and matzoh ball soup for a while now, so when I went in, I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich on rye for take-out. Apparently, they only serve matzoh ball soup on Fridays and Saturdays. Despite what seemed to be a very large number of people working, it still took about 15 minutes to make the sandwich. It's a pile of meat between 2 slices of bread with mustard. Why does it take so long?   I actually started craving smoked meat after looking at the photos posted here and I was literally salivating looking at all that glorious meat. Sadly, when I got back to my office with my sandwich less than 10 minutes later, I saw that it was filled with very dry meat, which tasted pretty average. What happened to the juicy, glistening smoked meat I saw in the photos? I should've taken a photo of my sandwich, but I was in a bit of a hurry to get to a meeting, so I just scarfed it back quickly. I have never needed to drink water while eating a smoked meat sandwich before, but this time, I did. Mind you, every place I've had a smoked meat sandwich before, they've always asked \"lean, medium or fatty?\" At Katz's, they don't give you the choice. I was expecting a happy combination, giving me some lean and some juicy, fatty meat. Nope.  I also had a side of cucumber salad and a dill pickle, which I didn't particularly enjoy, but that's on me - just not for me. Next time, I'll try a pastrami sandwich or just get some meat by the pound, on the weekend so I can get my matzoh ball soup."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off day when I went to Katz's deli. But I'll never be going back.   I was super excited to try this deli. As I waited to order the man behind the counter was unfriendly. He acted as if making and serving the sandwich was a huge burden. When it was ready he threw it up on the counter and rudely said \"here's your sandwich\".  It was just an uncomfortable exchange with someone who seems to hate what he's doing.  Then I went to pay. This is when I just get pissed off. The older man started out with friendly chat. As he takes my debit card in his hand he taps his tip jar . He then starts to explain how his dog is sick. I love animals I feel for the guy. He then goes into the details of how the dog is sick. This involves a tumour of the testicles that needs to be removed. This goes on for a few minutes....too long.  He then pulls out a picture of the dogs balls on his phone and shows me. I got turned off the food at this point.   I did eat half of it. Honestly it was the worst corned beef sandwich I've had. It was under seasoned and dry. The rye bread was very good. But that's all the good I can say about this place.  Katz's deli never again for me.  I just think there are way better out there in service and especially taste."}
{"text":"I'm puzzled by all the bad reviews... I find Katz's deli sandwiches quite moist and delicious. Never dry nor chewy.   My personal favourite is pastrami (on rye with mustard) because I love the extra seasoning and spice. It's subtle but you can definitely taste it. With a side of fries and gravy, that's a fine lunch indeed.  Struggling with which meat to order? The lady at Katz's described them this way: \"corned beef is mild, pastrami is spicy, smoked meat is sweet\". Not exactly sure what she means by \"sweet\" but I've also had the smoked meat and it's quite good as well.  Note: closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"If it's atmosphere and ambiance you're looking for, then look farther because you sure aint gonna find those HERE but what you will find is a fantastic corned beef sandwich. Katz's is big with a real cafeteria vibe and we went there around 11:00 so way before the lunch rush. It was nice and quiet but I'm sure that it can get noisy.   The sandwich was incredible - I've read other reviews citing dryness, etc. but mine was flawless. It was huge and the meat was so moist that it was glistening.   Agree about the mustard. You're a major player in the Toronto deli scene and PLAIN MUSTARD IS ALL YOU'VE GOT?!!!  The pickles - why do I have to get a small plate with five or six slices? Can't I just have ONE decent sized pickle? And when were they put out on these plates? Some look a tad \"dry.\"  Tried the potato salad: it was good, \"okay.\" Nothing to write home about. Just \"okay.\" Next time? I'm just getting the sandwich with no dish of dried-out pickles or uneventful potato salad.  Since the sandwich was the star of the show and it was great, I'd say that this lunch was a success. Next time, nix the sides."}
{"text":"I always enjoy their mixed plate which gives you a choice of two meats and salami. I recommend the tongue, it's soft, tender and juicy. Their matzo ball soup is okay, but it's a hit or miss.  Sometimes the soup is piping hot, sometimes it's colder than I like it to be."}
{"text":"I heard tons of good things about this place, which is why I gave it a go. It turned out, I didn't like the food as much, I found it very dry and plain tasting. All the gentlemen handling the meats were welcoming and friendly, also the cleaners, the only one person I had a problem with is the cashier... she was just plain rude. She made me wait, because she didn't want to cash me out and leave, and come back to cash out another customer. Excuse you..."}
{"text":"Corned beef sandwich was good but, asked for hot mustard and got some kind of dark sweet mustard. Beef knish with gravy was disappointing. Pastry was kind of chewy. Price was good."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style service.  My corned beef sandwich was tasty but the rye bread could have been a tad better and they need some real deli style mustard.  Portion was large however.  I've never ordered a knish before in Toronto, but if theirs are typical they are quite different than the New York variety.  First of all, they were sliced off a loaf and served with gravy.  Also, it was a meat knish.  Normally, when a menu says knish (at least from what I'm accustomed to) they are potato - if meat or kasha they are usually labeled as such.  It wasn't bad, but the crust could have been softer and was not quite what I had a taste for.  It was huge, though.  My partner had roast beef and some other stuff which he said was quite good.  Not cheap, but portion sizes justify the prices.  Since it is cafeteria, one can also skimp on tipping, especially as you bus your own food.  Free refills on soft drinks."}
{"text":"This place was good, sandwiches are piled high with meat, sides are good, everything is fairly priced. I'd probably come back if I was ever in the area again."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  The pastrami was delicious, the service was amazing- every person we saw, from the gentleman who took our order and sliced the meat to the guy that cashed us out smiled and cracked jokes, making our experience awesome. It's so nice (and rare) to see people not hating their jobs and having fun while they work."}
{"text":"I mean what can you say about a delicious warm Corned Beef on Rye Sandwich with a side Garlic Pickle. It's just down right delicious is what!!  Warm Corned Beef on a fresh Rye bread topped off with a generous dollop street mustard is fabulous! With the addition of Garlic Dill as a side it just takes to the sky for me. The sandwich is always tall & packed with meat. I've eaten here a number of times & it's been around for years to me the food has always been delicious. Go if you can, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Good meat if you're picking up and making your own sandwiches. Just don't order theirs. If I order a sandwich I expect a little more than a massive stack of deli meat between two slices of bread and a tablespoon of mustard. The fries weren't great either."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place a few years now, I'm not sure if it's been going downhill lately or it just happened that the last few times I've been here the quality of the meat was extremely fat (even tho they usually cut the fat off) All in all it's a good place for a huge deli sandwich but it's not cheap"}
{"text":"I got a Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye bread to go with the in house honey mustard at their take out area. The sandwich was pretty good. It was sliced fresh to order. It was nice and warm in the takeout bag.  Opening a montreal smoked meat sandwich kind of shocks me a bit every time I order one. By that I mean seeing the giant wad of meat sandwiched by two thin slices of rye. I found the meat juicy with quite a bit of fat that I could see. Though, I found it tad bland / lacking flavour compared to what I've had in Montreal (Schwartz's). Still though, quite delicious if you're craving a smoked meat sandwich. I found the honey mustard crazy hot...that it gave me a headache while I was eating.   The sandwich was 9.95+tax. Yeah it's kind of pricey, but really this is pretty standard pricing for smoked meat sandwiches. It's a lot of meat for about 10 bucks.  I shared this sandwich in half with a friend, and found it satisfying. Service at the take out area  was fast and very courteous. I was waiting for my order and noticed that this place gets quite busy during lunch time. Seems like most people dine in as opposed to doing take out."}
{"text":"You walk in unsure about which line is takeout and which is dine-in.  You try to order a can of pop which for some reason they only have two flavours.  The rest is fountain.  You see the prices of the sandwiches and cringe.  $10 plus tax for corned beef without any sides or a drink or even a pickle? Yikes! But then you start eating your massive sandwich and realize it is good, actually,  it is delicious.   The quantity and quality don't fully make you forget that you overpaid but it is a great sandwich!   Definitely going back whenever I crave corned beef.  While the sandwich is pricey, its still cheaper than traveling to Montreal for meat."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at Katz's in 80s and they were really good.  I went back a couple weeks ago as I hadn't been there in about 15 years.  15 years ago, I had a bad experience and when I complained to the owner's (the wife) she was not concerned and told me not to come back if I was unhappy so we didn't.. My husband and I were and found the food to be good and the sandwiches to be extremely generous in size.  The sandwiches are about $10.00 which is kind of expensive when you are in a cafeteria style restaurant  However the meat was fresh hot, moist and flavourful so we felt it was worth it."}
{"text":"My wife picked up 2 corned beef sandwiches yesterday as she was in the area.  I haven't eaten at Katz's in a while but for $21 for 2 sandwiches, I wasn't impressed.  Maybe it was because I requested hot mustard and got honey mustard instead.  I personally like Centre Street deli in Thornhill better."}
{"text":"My review more or less agrees with Lorenzo L's. I agree this deli is good but not great. I have been coming here on and off since they opened in the 1970's maybe a couple of times a year. If they had been exceptional we would have come a lot more times cause let's face it, you have to be a bit of a masochist to cram yourself into the frantic zoo that is Yorkdale Shopping Centre's food court aka Dine On 3, when you could drive across the street to Katz's Deli, find lots of free parking even in Christmas week & sit & read the paper & relax while noshing excellent Montreal Smoked Meat, Pastrami, & Corned Beef or Roast Beef steaming hot and piled high on rye, onion bun or kaiser bun. You will of course have it with a plate of bitingly salt and sour kosher dill pickles & wonderful Vernor's Ginger Soda, a soft drink taste you'll be glad you acquired.    Follow Lorenzo's advice though and concentrate on the deli meat dishes, don't worry about the sides, they're nothing special. There's a nitpick others have mentioned: they only have yellow mustard and honey mustard. The counter lady kept saying the honey mustard was hot but it isn't, and as a diabetic, I shouldn't be having honey. Katz's Deli has been at this location since 1970 and still hasn't discovered the wonders of real deli mustard. There's no deli mustard, no Dijon, no hot mustard, no grainy or brown mustard, nada! (Katz should see the fantastic selection of different flavoured mustards at the Devil's PunchBowl General Store in Stoney Creek: his eyes would bug out!)  As for the sides, when we came just before 6:30 pm on Wed. Dec. 20th, there was no more onion buns or kaiser buns left and the plain white rye bread had been sitting in the open in piles all day, assembly line style, and had gotten dried out and stale. No amount of mediocre generic mustard would have saved it. Toasted and buttered, maybe, an option not available. Someone should tell Katz's staff not to take the bread out of the bag or the loaf until the last minute! Cooking 101, ladies & gents.  The coleslaw, thank God, is done vinegar style, a little sweeter than I prefer, but not horribly sweet mayonnaise creamy style. Only one restaurant I know of does coleslaw better: the Q Diner chicken restaurant on the Queensway that offers you a choice of vinegar or mayonnaise style.  Fries and gravy is reasonably priced, but they make the same mistake as Pickle Barrel--the fries are hard dry thin sticks that the brown gravy can't moisten. Wieners and beans, a bargain hearty treat at under $9.00 which hubby had been craving was perfectly steamed and delicious.  I was totally mellow at this point, crunched my lovely kosher dills, wrestled with the mounds and mounds of tasty Montreal Smoked Meat that fell from the tiny rye rounds, sipped my wonderful Vernor's Ginger Soda cans and contently read the afternoon paper, another day of successful Christmas shopping over & enjoying the relative quiet. I am NOT wanting to trade places with the Yorkdale crowds trying in vain to get into the jammed holiday season parking lots!  Keep this place in mind if you're in the area and enjoy deli food anyway. You can pair your sandwich or meat plate with a pea soup, matzo ball soup or borscht soup."}
{"text":"Best Montreal smoked meat in Toronto!  Pickles are the best.  Cole slaw and fries good.  Love this place.  Meat lover restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pricey and average.  But in today's food service industry, that's not as bad as it sounds."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out recently after passing by it for the past year. This emporium as they call it is a self serve, cafeteria style dine in place with a take out section at the front. Almost everything aside from the sandwiches are already pre made. You grab your cold salads, order your sandwich, and proceed to the hot foods table before paying. The sandwiches are meaty, they stack up the meat but the rye accompanying the sandwich is rather small and you get an overwhelming mouthful of meat with little to no bread. The meat however was good, very flavourful. They give you the option of regular mustard or honey mustard. We got the chicken noodle soup as well and that was such a disappointment. It was a scoop of noodles with what I presume was chicken broth poured over it and topped with some carrots. Overall the meal was not the best and it was rather expensive for a sandwich, a side, and a drink. The two of us came to almost forty dollars! You pay for every individual item, no combos here! Not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious and the perfect comfort sandwich. I love the honey mustard and the old school cafeteria style ordering. Booms"}
{"text":"Delicious meat sandwich. Hot and honey sauce taste good.  The Mama's soup on the other hand a little bit on the light side."}
{"text":"I've driven by this massive purple and yellow structure with a dude in a safari hat many times when leaving town or hitting the Yorkdale Mall. I've always wondered what a corned beef emporium looks like on the inside, and a few nights ago was my lucky day!   I was hitting the Party City on Orfus Rd, and my darling was driving me. He was grunting, easily agitated and yes, you guessed it, hangry. Finally! My chance to see the insides of a corned beef emporium had arrived.   The inside of this place is downright weird. You turn left into the cafeteria and grab cold plates and order hot dishes, then pay, then grab a seat. It was sort of like if Ikea started serving smoked meat instead of meatballs. It's too expensive for what it is, but a good Montreal smoked meat sandwich always hits the spot.   I really like weird, so four stars for this safari lovin' corned beef emporium!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for Pastrami on Rye (medium fat is the best!). You can definetly share one of these sandwiches as they are big and you can get extra bread.  They gave a wide array of other meats such as Montreal smoked meat, roast beef, etc but i love the pastrami too much to try anything else.  It's a cafeteria style restaurant and been around forever.  Right across the street from Yorkdale Mall with its own parking lot so very convenient."}
