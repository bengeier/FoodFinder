{"text":"Ventured into the Mental Health District eatery on a Thursday and took our spot at the bar as per usual. Love the new Spanish tapas food craze that's been inquisitioning its way through the Toronto food scene.  After being mildly impressed at Bar Isabelle and offensively disappointed with Patria, we walked into Carmen with muted expectations.  First we tried the Iberico Ham - tough - no marbling - texture of Asian style beef jerkey  Second - Jicama with Avocado - texturally didn't work - felt of a glob of guac on a radish - maybe leaving the texture of the non-smashed avocado could work better  Main Course - Traditional Seafood Paella Hands down the best Paella we have had outside spain - served in its roasting dish with an abundance of fresh seafood - permeated with fresh peas and chorizo and Saffron and wait for it.... we have Socrato - the crunchy sweet caramelized peppers and onions-  take note all other Spanish Hautes .....ahem Patria.... - an amazing choice that fed 2 - 3 for $35  Staff was friendly and attentive and fun - was recommended a well balanced Argentinian Malbec that paired perfectly with my Pae.  Will go back for Paella alone"}
{"text":"Great food , great atmosphere. Not too expensive. Great place to catch up with old friends over a variety of interesting tapas. Would come back."}
{"text":"Carmen, to say the least, was pretty disappointing. But I should mention that I just came back from experiencing some of the best tapas Spain has to offer, so my expectations were pretty high. It is also pretty pricey, and I would have to say that your money is better spent elsewhere.  Between the four of us, we ordered a paella dish and 8 tapas dishes, which was more than enough food for us. They recommend that you order the paella as soon as possible since it takes about 45-50 minutes to cook the dish.  The more notable dishes of the evening consist of the following: Fried artichokes - cooked with maldon salt and aioli, this dish was the table's favourite of the evening. Definitely a must-try. Shisito peppers - at first I thought they were spicy, but looks can be deceiving - the tomato sauce is sweet if anything. Kale salad - comes with ricotta, pine nuts, and a crispy poached egg which is a really nice touch. Although I still prefer the kale salad at Gusto101.   Roasted potatoes - with brava sauce and aioli - a good filler.  We shared the Paella del Carmen ($40!). Not worth it for $10/person."}
{"text":"This is one of THE BEST Spanish tapas restaurants I've been to - a statement I am boldly making considering Ive only tried three of their tapas dishes and a cocktail!   I ordered the blackberry mojito which was a refreshing take on the classic- there were blackberries crushed at the bottom of my drink and the mojito was not too sweet either.   For the tapas we ordered:   Bacon wrapped with dates stuffed with manchego cheese and almonds - this WAS HEAVENLY.  they only give you four dates on a skewer but darn, the sweet and savoury with the contrasting textures were euphoric for my taste buds.    Octopus with spanish chorizo and potatoes  - of the three this was our least favourite but still quite good! however even for sharing bite sized portions, the amount of octopus was scarce compared to the tomato sauce that was given.  The roasted tomatoes were the actual stars of this dish.    Rabbit and snail angel hair pasta  - I think this used to be a paella dish but now on their tapas menu instead- the rabbit is shredded and slow cooked so the meat is extremely tender.  The angel hair pasta isn't actually like Italian angel hair pasta but a type Mediterranean vermicelli which is broken into small pieces that are actually around 1-2 cm in length.   Some of my fellow diners felt the rabbit was a tad too salty so i suggest ensuring you have some vermicelli and snails to help balance the flavours out since they are less heavily seasoned.    Spying on the couple sitting adjacent to us devouring their seafood paella definitely has made my heart set on returning!"}
{"text":"Really lovely Spanish restaurant, although on the expensive side.   Their tapas menu has some vegan options (the jicama/avocado and cauliflower/hummus/pomergranate dishes were both lovely) as well as some vegetarian ones. And of course, lots of great meat options my friends loved.  They even had soy milk if you want to get a coffee or something, and were very flexible to requests.   The atmosphere was relaxed and was not too noisy when we went, but I've heard it can get very crowded.   I would make a reservation if you are going on a popular night, and note that any pilafs take 45 minutes to make."}
{"text":"Delicious (and not too expensive) food served in a wonderful space by great staff. I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.   A group of five went out tonight and shared most of the menu. Biggest highlights were the fried artichokes, the potatoes, the fried tomatoes and the jicama with avocado.   The sangria, paella, grilled shrimp, kale salad, blood sausage with chickpeas and sardines were all wonderful as well.   When the bill arrived we were shocked at how inexpensive it ended up being considering how much food we ordered.  The only misses for me were the olives and a little more bread might have been nice. Otherwise, an overall great experience."}
{"text":"I don't want to start by dissing this place as it has many great online reviews and we have wanted to go here for quite some time but when it rains it pours and we happened to hit \"the perfect storm\".  We were doing the Queen West thing on the weekend and just happened to be in front of Carmen's when it opened for the day. We were the first in for the day.  We started by ordering the Paella with the Confit Rabbit and Sous Vide Snails as the menu and our waitress warned that the Paella took app 40-45 mins for preparation. We had some wine and ordered a couple of the Tapas starters. The Sardinas were quite nice and served in a little tin can like store sardines. And then...  #1 - a lady showed up, sitting a few tables away from us, waiting for friends and ordered the chicken and seafood paella but asked for no chicken in the paella (why I noticed/paid attention to this I have no idea). Her 2 friends showed up shortly thereafter.  #2 - our second tapas app, the breaded green tomatoes with feta, peppers and corn chutney arrived. My wife split the 4 pieces between us and we dug in, they were excellent, I scarfed mine down and then...my wife found a hair in her portion. It appeared to be a beard hair, kind of short and wirey. We informed the waitress who apologized and took her plate away. She shortly returned and said they took it off the bill and the chef said if wasnt a beard hair but was in fact corn silk and that no one in the kitchen had a beard. We thanked her for that but noted that when you have an open concept kitchen and 3 of the 5 guys on the kitchen brigade have beardy faces you shouldn't make such claims.  We waited for the paella while drinking our wine when.....(remember #1?)....a waitress brought the 3 ladies their paella. My wife asked why they were getting theirs when we ordered our 10-15 mins earlier. I said maybe it had to do with the fact that they didn't have the chicken that theirs was ready earlier. And then....  #3 - one of the ladies had spooned the paella onto her plate and was cutting into the meat and asked the waitress if they had ordered no chicken in their paella and that waitress informed her that it was rabbit. The waitress took their plates and paella back to the kitchen. Several of the kitchen and wait staff stood in the open kitchen and glanced in our direction. A waitress then took the proper seafood paella out to the ladies.  #4 - a few minutes later our waitress brought the original order of paella over to our table. We told her that we had seen everything and won't take the paella and would just take the bill for what we had consumed.   She was a very sweet girl and apologized for the mix up as another waitress had delivered our paella to the ladies. We paid our bill and insisted on tipping her but she said she would not accept a tip.   As I mentioned, the restaurant and menu looked really nice, the reviews were good and the food we had was very good. We would love to return and try again but we will have to wait until the time is right.  I think the restaurant gods were not looking down on us at Carmen this weekend."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favourite Restraunt in the city right now. Luis ( the chef extraordinaire ) has magic in his hands which is evident in his tapas. The avocado pur√©e with Jicama was fresh, crispy, creamy and absolutely fantastic in its flavours The fried green tomatoes with balsamic onions was another stellar dish on the menu which is a must have Fried artichokes were heavenly, crisp and moist with a lovely mayo- cream drizzle on it The grilled shrimp with Serrano chilli butter melted in your mouth, hot and fresh off the grill with a. Squeeze of lemon juice A pleasant surprise came in the form of corn kernels cooked with chilies and spices in a cast iron skillet- delicious  We ended the evening with 2 paellas- the mushroom and the Carmen which were both excellent- As I said to chef Luis before we left, \" you have customers for life\""}
{"text":"Want to try this place.  I'm so dissapointed to read the bad comments about it as all come from Spanish people(based on the names) as I think should be more supportive and proposing changes instead of keeping people far from it.  I still want to give them a chance and try the Paella!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Paella Negra with octopus and fish to start. It was very tasted and the fish was done to perfection. We also ordered the rabbit and snail angel hair pasta, the fried green tomatoes and the Patatas bravas. All were super tasty. The angel hair pasta was a bit salty but I find most rabbit dishes are anyway.   The sangria is yummy too.  Overall, great atmosphere and the food is quite delicious."}
{"text":"The fried artichokes . Crispy and tangy. Not heavy or oily. Delicious.  But the  Paella with the whole roasted stripped bass was not only pleasing to look at but also very tasty. Loved the crispy burnt pieces of rice that you have to scrap off the bottom of the pan. Service was attentive and knowledgeable.  3rd visit and will most definitely keep returning"}
{"text":"The drinks are great, the tapas are a bit on the pricier side, the atmosphere is nice and easy, and no pretentious servers or bartenders here. The service is friendly and prompt. With all of this combined, it's a great place.    I would recommend the paella. Made to order which takes about an hour, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious that I was dreaming about that night!  Everything they brought out of that kitchen was better than the next! I highly recommend this place.   I really want to try the paella next time but they say in their menu that you need to order it 45 minutes in advance."}
{"text":"First time coming here for my friend's bday dinner!!! service & food were certainly living up to standards & beyond!!!  It's such an exceptional staff & chef!!!  You are all awesome !!! We will def come back !! Thank You"}
{"text":"I'll be back ...this place is perfect for a date or small groups of friends. They take their menu and food seriously. Love it!"}
{"text":"I really liked Carmen - I've gone there numerous times over the past years, but my recent experience last Friday totally changed my perspective about the place.   My parents, sister and some family were in town visiting so I had made reservations for 8PM at Carmen. We got there 5 minutes early and were escorted by a senior member of the staff - who as it happens actually runs the place - to wait in their back patio, which was empty due to the cold weather that night. We were then told that our table is a little delayed. The reason was that the previous party \"took longer to order\". We waited 1 HOUR for the table to free up! Are you kidding me? What's the point of having a reservation? They didn't bother calling me to tell me they were running a litte behind. The lady at the restaurant argued with me when I had proposed that it would have been nice to receive a courtesy call about this so that we didn't have to wait outside in the cold with older family members. They did not offer us anything while waiting - I mean what kind of customer service is this? Where do these people learn the fundamentals of hospitality and FNB services? I racked up a $700 bill that night and they did not rectify their \"mess up\" by offering a complimentary round of drinks or some food or anything for that matter. I was very excited to get my family to experience Carmen. Unfortunately the service lacked respect and professionalism. It's sad to see how some restaurants run their establishments with low quality service, without understanding that little things go a long way.  Unfortunately, I will never be stepping foot in Carmen again."}
{"text":"Went here for a ladies night out and I'm glad we did! I probably wouldn't have chosen this place as the vegetarian options are a bit limited but what they do have is worth the trip!  Service was great, atmosphere was awesome and the food was delicious. I would definitely venture back!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday after reading all the great reviews, so I was extremely disappointed with my experience at the restaurant. I have had paella in Spain and the paella here does not compare at all! I felt like I was eating risotto instead. We ordered several appetizers which were bland and forgettable. The only saving grace was the dessert, but let's face it, anything involving sugar is hard to screw up. Also, there were 7 of us so there was an 18% gratuity, but for some reason the waiter seemed to want to avoid making eye contact with us. For the price we were paying, is decent service too much to ask for?!!!"}
{"text":"Second time dining at Carmen and it was even better than the first time!  Had a table for 4 at 8:30 on a Friday, and we were seated promptly.  We tried the cocktail menu (only 4 drinks but such great drinks they were)!   Favourite was Frederico - the flavours hit me unexpectedly..sour, spicy, sweet, herbs, tequila. I took a sip and said: WHOA! And then everyone at the table had to sample it. Seriously, I could drink a pitcher of this stuff and happily wobble home :)  Carmen (the drink) is sweet, fruity, frothy, delicious..such a girly concoction.  We ate:  Patatas Bravas - crunchy battered morsels of fried potato drizzled with this delicious sweet, savoury, creamy sauce. Heaven!  Jamon Iberico - Spanish prosciutto but drizzled with oil, to be enjoyed with baguette slices. Ok but it's simply prosciutto.  Grilled Shrimp with heads on. These were like mini lobsters (langoustine, I believe). Butterflied, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and a bit of heat. Hands down the best dish on the menu!  Green Fried Tomato - battered, fried, 4 thick pieces, layered with red pepper chutney & feta (on each layer). Second best dish on the menu.  Honourable mentions: sardines, Catalan pork sausage.  Indifferent: Pimientos (Shisito peppers)..underwhelming, not much flavour.  We loooooooved the food and were patting our full bellies.  However, the service was a little off. Our server was MIA for most of the night.   Never cleared our plates and since this is tapas style dining, we were running out of space. Our shrimp shells were overflowing and it just looked messy!  There was a food runner whom we used as our server to order more food or drinks..He was polite but not overly vested in us.  We weren't too offended but only because food/drinks came out pretty quickly and given how good everything tasted.  (Dinner for 4, 2 drinks each, ran us $230 plus tip)  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"To the point: Nothing tasted \"bad\" but the paella was least impressive for $54?! Don't try to convince us that the rice stuck to the pan was a bonus for that price. It's RICE. Give a cup more, and it would actually look plentiful. For the cost of our overall tab, we'll never eat here again. Lackluster."}
{"text":"The shrimp and ceviche here is off the chain delicious!!! It was so good I'm not even sure if I want to share that info because it's nice that it's not too busy! Our server was friendly and attentive- a rare treat on Queen St. these days. We sat at the sidewalk table and enjoyed the laid back vibe and people watching. The mussels and octopus were good too, but those portions were pretty tiny so I probably wouldn't order them again (I love to eat!). Also the mismatched floral dishware adds a nice touch. Nice cozy tapas spot with delicious seafood."}
{"text":"Great traditional paella as well as some creative house paellas. Fantastic Spanish tapas as well as Ceviche, beef Tartare, and some other international appetizers. The service and ambiance were excellent. Pricey but well worth the experience"}
{"text":"A large group of friends and I visited eating all of the food including the following:  Angel hair pasta with rabbit: I'm usually not a fan of rabbit but it surprisingly tasted a lot like chicken.. as a pasta dish that came in a hot plate and it was not what I was expecting.. but nonetheless, it was delicious.. also the menu doesn't mention this but there are snails in the dish  Bacon wrapped dates: I'm not a fan of dates but the cheese in this dish made it a surprising mix of flavors in your mouth.  Shishito peppers: was underwhelming.. it was a little bland and overcooked for my taste.. it was like eating welted peppers.  fried artichokes: this dish was by far my favorite out of all the tapas we tried. great crunch, flavor and that aioli on it was just divine.  Grilled shrimp: the shrimp were absolutely massive and easy to peel out.. so simple and so delicious.. it's like garlic buttered shrimp melting in your mouth  ceviche tuna and trout: the trout is exactly what you expect when you order ceviche.. though with all the added peppers and vegetables you had to fish around for the trout.. the tuna seemed to be swimming in a oily puddle.. however, taste-wise it faired better than the trout.. there are much better places to order ceviche.  paella del carmen & negra: carmen definitely had a stronger flavor and was much more tastier .. the majority of my friends preferred carmen.. however, I did also enjoy the more settle flavors of the negra.. and the sea bass had already been deboned which was a plus."}
{"text":"NO AC!!!!!! We went on a HOT day, where AC is a must for a big party!!  They did not offer patio seats and did not inform about AC not working, which makes the whole experience a very bad one.  Tapas are a bit pricy for the portion it came with! The avocado pur√©e is $8 with 4 tiny dumpling looking things... Paellas are extraordinary, one of he best in town! We wanted to order more, but the heat, we just wanna leave after the first few tapas!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here in August 2013.  Being big fans of Torito, we were looking forward to trying Carmen.  The fried artichokes were great.  It went downhill from there.  When you order Iberico ham in a good Spanish place (like Torito), you're supposed to get hand-cut ham from a whole pig leg that is sitting on the bar.  At Carmen, you get 3 deli-sliced pieces of (cheaper) Serrano ham with some olive oil drizzled on it.  (This was such a rip off that I had to complain to the chef when he passed through, who acknowledged the outrage but said he had no room for a whole pig leg.)  The tortilla was pretty good.  We tried the shrimp but we really wanted to eat traditional gambas ajillo (shrimp drowning in butter and garlic).  Their gambas ajillo was a more pedestrian grilled shrimp.    The tinned mussels were as exciting as a can of smoked oysters on Ritz crackers.  The rice pudding dessert was awesome.    After being disappointed by so many dishes, we were like, what is wrong with this place?  Then it hit us: Carmen is Torito, priced up and dumbed down for the Queen West crowd.  So, if you live near Queen West and you don't know any better, you'll like Carmen.  If you don't, or you do, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here with another fellow Carmen to try the famous paella de Carmen and we were so stuffed by the end of the meal. We ordered the paella as soon as we sat down since they warned it would take ~45 minutes to cook.   They don't skimp on the seafood in this dish. We shared the fried artichoke for the appetizer as we waited for the paella. Between 2 people this was more than enough. We came on a work night in the middle of week, so the restaurant wasn't too busy either.  Since this is tapas, I would love to return with a larger group to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre tapas and limited beer selection. Been to many similar settings and this would rank at the bottom.  Service was not bad when we were seated but whoever greeted us was not the most pleasant."}
{"text":"I brought my wife there on a Wednesday night and we were definitely impressed. The restaurant has a very cozy feel. I had made reservations so we were given the comfortable booth seating.  Service and food were fantastic. We ordered the Carmen and Margarita for our cocktails and shared 5 tapas items. Bacon wrapped dates, cauliflower, pork loin, mussels and grilled sardines.  This was my first time trying Spanish cuisine and Carmen made a very good first impression for me."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING......  Some tapas were excellent others average. Ambiance was beautiful , we were out in terrace (see pic) but we got food poisoning and we're sick for 3 days. The waitress was very accommodating with our stroller and 2 babies! The drinks were so so."}
{"text":"Food taste good, however the size of Peallas is a bit smaller compared to other Spanish restaurant. Also tapas is quite overpriced (yes) giving the size and its presentation. I will not say service is good at all. Looks like our waitress is more willing to provide better services for another table who spoke Spanish and keep ignoring us (purposely not looking at out direction, I can tell). We still pay 15% tips and the bill is over $100 for two. Will not go again, for the quality of food and the level of service, you have better option elsewhere."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and have eaten here a few times. It's almost always busy so the times we've wanted to sit in the dining room have been a bit of a wait but not too long. Other times we just sit at the bar which is equally as fun.   All the food is authentic and this is the best paella I've had in the city.   Tapas that stand out are the Jicama with avocado, crispy shrimp. Cocktails are great too, and sometimes they have daily specials, usually a Spanish cocktail."}
{"text":"I love Spanish food so when I discovered this place I was so excited to try it. I went last weekend and had an amazing time with friends. We ordered a bunch of small plates and finalized our meal with the Carmen paella....oh my goodness it was out of this world! Be warned it takes an hour to make it so if you want to order it make sure you do when you first order. It's nice to know that it takes that long because at least you know it's fresh and from scratch. The vibe in there is buzzing and really nice, they have a great selection of wines and the staff is super friendly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night, with a friend.  I had no idea this place existed. Good thing THAT's been corrected.  Luckily for us, it wasn't crazy-busy when we went, so we got a sense of the place. The ambience was nice - it wasn't overly noisy, so we could hear ourselves talk.  The food is absolutely delicious! We split the Pulpo a la Vinegreta (never had octopus like THIS before), Pan de Cristal con Tomate de Rama (perfectly crunchy and savoury), Paella de Monta√±a (first time having rabbit AND snails - both very good), and a lobster salad.  I also managed to fit in desert - a fantastic blood orange ice cream.  I only had a glass of white wine (a godello, which wasn't bad.), so I can't really speak to the drink selection.   Just a note - it's a tad bit pricey. But I think it's worth it.  I left this place, remembering my trip to Spain several years ago, and wondering when I'll return.   Overall, a fantastic place for a meal. Try it!"}
{"text":"Came to Carmen around 9 p.m. a Saturday night for two without a reservation. They still had table at the bar available, but not in the main dining area. Fine. The opening and closing of the door made for a bit of a chilly dining experience and the fluorescent lighting a bit odd, but the food made up for it! Spanish food ranks as one of my favourite cuisines.   Drinks to start: Red and White Sangria. This was made with a variety of liquors, red/white wine, and orange juice.   We had a variety of tapas (maybe 5), I can only remember 4:    Marinated mussels plated in an open can served with bread - It's kind of like ceviche, but with oil, but doesn't have an oily mouth feel. Just smooth with a bit of a vinegar hit. It's nice.  Pressed watermelon with iberico ham on a skewer - This was refreshing and an idea I would \"borrow\" for my own summer party. A bit stingy on the iberico ham though. Maybe they should increase the cost a bit if the price of the ham is at a premium.   Grilled shrimp - Four shrimps, butterflied and grilled perfectly with lemon juice and salt. Especially tasty of you eat the head of the shrimp.   Homemade sausage with lentils and amazing demi-glace-like sauce - the sauce was phenomenal. I could eat this sauce with lentils everyday. The sausage was tender as well.   A glass of sweet sherry topped off the meal. Cost was about $100 for two.  The owner came around to say hello and introduced the menu very well.   I'd love to come back with 4 people and share the paella and some additional tapas. The main dining area with the warm wood and high ceilings looked very relaxing."}
{"text":"Gorgeous room, Nice vibes food was kind of tasty but all kind of deep fried-maybe our hostess should have sugggested we vary it up a bit....anyway Im dying to find a decent tapas place in Toronto.-like a real legit place-this aint it but its not bad."}
{"text":"Pure genius.  For those of you have visited Spain and are looking for a true tapas experience that can remind you of that trip, I implore you to visit Carmen. From the moment we stepped in the ambience and energy of this place made us feel alive. We made reservations and I highly suggest u do the same as this place was packed this Friday night. We opted to sit outside and the patio is very lovely and less noisy then inside. But hey that at be your thing.  Tapas tapas and more tapas was the order of the evening. We had s√≤ooooo much. First off you should try the estrella damm tapas journey I'd u are there in the next two weeks. Not on the menu but amazing items. I had croquettes,  octopus, jamon, fried green tomatoes, patatas bravas, sardines and other goodies. Wine and drinks were also great. I highly recommend this restaurant and will be backany any times. Great staff too. Karen and Francois were amazing servers. Full of great energy and so friendly.  We found out they have herbias which is a great liquor native to Ibiza. Both Zara and I will be back soon. Muay bien!"}
{"text":"There have been reviews on here about this place, which shows they aren't that great. This is a more detailed review of our experience:  - We had an 8 pm reservation for 4 people. Instead of being given a table for 4, we were given 2 round tables in the bar area with high traffic of people pushed together. Even the first person for our party to arrive had given my name on the reservation to which no one seemed to be certain if we even had one. I have read on other review sites that this is not the first time this has occurred. I truly think this needs to be handled better. We were hoping that we were going to be given a better table eventually which never happened.   - As mentioned above our reservation was at 8 pm, and we really didn't receive any food until after 9. We did order as soon as someone was able to serve us.  - The runners bringing out the tapas plates had brought the wrong dish to our table 2 times before we even got out first dish. It did occur with other dishes as the night wore on. Since we were seated in the bar area, it looked like to us that the bartender was not only making drinks for the entire restaurant, but trying to take care of the tables out front as well. That doesn't seem logical as being the bartender itself is a full time job. Even though he did apologize to us for the constant mess ups I don't feel there was enough done about it to address it. One of the people at our table even had to ask for bread. Taking the initiative approach to do these little things without the customer having to ask for it would go a long way.  - The Paella which we were advised to order at the start of our night, given that it takes 45 mins to an hour to make arrived midway through us receiving our other tapas plates. We assumed that this would be the last serving to come out as the small tapas dishes would build up to it. We were not even done the Paella dish and constantly kept being asked if we wanted it cleared off, and that was about the most attention we received all night.   - My wife had ordered another drink on the menu but the bartender brought her the same drink she ordered in her first order which was incorrect.  - I am not sure if your restaurant offers any kind of dessert or anything of that sort, and likely we'll never know as it was never offered to us. Long after our plates were cleared it was only till one of our friends at the table flagged down the bartender for the bill which he brought to us in not even a minute.   That about sums it up!"}
{"text":"After traveling to Southern Spain, I went to Torito in Kensington seeking authentic Spanish tapas.  Carmen is Luis Valenzuela's newest venture and I was excited to eat here!    I was surprised at how large the space was.  It was elegant and vibrant and still casual-cool-hipster.  We ordered a bunch of small plates while we waited for the paella (you have 45 minutes to kill, about 5 plates did the trick).  The vegetarian items were much better than expected.   The fried artichokes were especially memorable.  I didn't know artichokes could be that good!  Fried Green Tomatoes were also a favourite.  Crispy and flavourful, the slices were stacked on top of each other.  Cute presentation!  The sardines were also fantastic.  I like how they include the can on the plate.  The paella was unique and great for sharing (we shared it amongst three people).  The Paella de Monta√±a ($30) has snails and rabbit.  The snails were ginormous and tasty morsels, the rabbit was tender and juicy.  There was a lot of rice which needed a bit more fat to bring it all together.   The dinner items were good but the desserts were disappointing.  (disappointed face) The charred pineapple with pine nuts seemed like a health snack. We didn't finish it.  It needed more charring.  More seasoning.  More anything.  The creme brule ... was completely boring.  The milk dessert looked as exciting as the creme boringness.  As for cocktails, I had the signature cocktail the Carmen... $14 bucks for 12 oz. mixed drink.  It was expensive and not really worth it.    Overall, I had a good experience at Carmen, but when I compare Carmen to other tapas restaurants that have sprung up in Toronto, I can't say the food is stand-out.  But Carmen is worth a visit if you haven't been there, just leave room for dessert, somewhere else."}
{"text":"my friends and i have been here twice and it is fantastic. i love their decor. the appetizer shrimps are amazing. just be ready to get your hands a little dirty. what also surprised me is their cauliflower! it easily became our group's favourite. my only comment would be their carmen paella... after waiting 45 minutes for it i was just ok. next time will try the squid ink paella. oh and make room for the churros! we tried all three desserts and that was the best."}
{"text":"Came here from Yelp review and I think it's definitely under rated! They had amazing service, good tapas, wonderful Sangria and the best Paella thus far. (Tried paella in different places and Spain and this one still tops it)  If you love paella you gotta try this place out!"}
{"text":"We were there on a summer weekday night, and their lovely yard didn't get busy until around 7:30.  The paella takes 50min to cook, so make sure you order upon arrival! We had the fried green tomato for starter while waiting. It was amazing - rich, layered flavour of tomato, corn, and onion, with a perfect hint of cheesiness. The Carmen paella was definitely worth the wait. We enjoyed every little bit of it, even scraped the pan a little. The shrimp was so soft it felt like heaven, and the rice was covered in sauce coming directly from those seafood.  Will definitely visit again with a larger group - just so i can get a taste of more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love it at Carmen's! I first went by when it opened and have since been back many times. The food and atmosphere is great for groups and encourages sharing. After living in Spain, eating at Carmen's makes me feel quite nostalgic. I think my favourite item on the menu would have to be the fried artichokes."}
{"text":"Perfect. Love the food, love the wine list. Tapas is my favourite style and Carmen does it right.   Probably the only item on the menu we didn't try was the paella. If you like rioja's they have the best selection I've seen in Toronto.  The portions are generous and between 6 of us we wound up ordering 2 of most things because we just couldn't stop eating.  The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. The atmosphere is cool and comfortable.   Looking forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!  The food was so amazing! One of the best tapas places I have been to and i have been to a lot! Totally took me back to my vacation in Spain.  We were a group of six and all of us enjoyed the food. We had; Patatas Bravas (superb), Pulpo a la Vinagreta (the best octopus ever!), Flying fish (so good... but so little!) and a Pork dish, the name of which I can not find.  We also ordered the Paella which takes 45/50 minutes to cook so they ask you to order in the beginning itself. We had the Paella del Carmen and it was superb, for the 6 of us I felt it was not enough but its the perfect quantity for 4 (with tapas).   The drinks however were not the best. The 6 of us each had different drinks and the best was a cocktail called Full Moon, the rest were average.   Will definitely go back for the food!"}
{"text":"So lucky a friend of mine referred this amazing restaurant to us. We ordered the their signature paella dish called the Paella del Carmen. This dish did not disappoint. Its was like being invited over to a friends house and eating a wholesome hearty home style paella. Amazing! Every bite brought a tear to my eye.   Their tapas were also top notch! See the pics for details. I will definitely make it a point to visit everytime I crave beautiful meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. Flavourful and a nice variety. Garbage service...had a reso for 830, got seated 40 mins later. No room at bar to have a drink. Server was a nice but basically ignored us all evening. We had to wave her down the entire night. They seem very short staffed. Would return on a week night assuming service would be improved with less crowd."}
{"text":"We came by for after dinner drinks so we can't comment on the food but the bar experience was excellent. The staff was honest, jovial, and, most Importantly made a delicious drink. I ordered their blackberry margarita, which was tasty as can be. My husband ordered a mojito, which was not on  the menu but not a problem, and it was delightful.  They also served fresh potato chips for noshing. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I recently organized a birthday dinner for my boyfriend at Carmen. The food was delicious and we received great service from our server Andreas. I would have given a better rating but dealing with management to organize the birthday dinner was frustrating. When I first inquired about organizing my boyfriend's birthday dinner, six weeks prior, I spoke to a member of the management team who made certain commitments to me. Two weeks before the event, when I called to make final arrangements, I was told by the owner that the manager did not have authority to make those commitments and she wanted to impose a minimum spend and charge me a cake cutting fee that I had previously been told had been waived (to be transparent, this fee were later waived). I was then told that the only way to avoid the minimum spend was to ask everyone pay cash or debit. This was very embarassing for me but I had no choice but to convey the message to my guests as I had less than two weeks before the event and couldn't change the venue at the last minute. On the night of the dinner, the owner kept getting frustrated with our group, even though we stayed in our space, and it dampned the mood of those who had to deal with her. At one point, a couple of our friends came at the end just to say happy birthday and she told them that they could not sit at the table, even though there were empty seats and made them wait in the bar. They eventually left. This is totally unacceptable and unfortunately it spoiled the experience for me and for my boyfriend, the guest of honour, who had to witness it. I do not recommend having a group dinner at this restaurant. You will not feel welcome."}
{"text":"Delicious food with the paella de Carmen better than what I've had in Spain! Delicious and surprising addition of long beans really added to the amazing melding of other flavors. Fried artichokes and quail were very tasty tapas as well. A tad on pricey side (ie. paella was $46) but hey Queen West rents aren't cheap! (and a bargain compared to the scene that is Patria)  Biggest criticism as other reviewer mentioned was how close each table is. Impossible to have any private conversation. But amazing to have an authentic Spanish restaurant which is a cuisine that is underrepresented in Toronto."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday and it is a Very pleasant place with good service. The appetizers are good but the paella de Montana was fantastic. Worth trying if you are in the mood for a good paella."}
{"text":"I went to Carmen's for a ladies night dinner and it was absolutely brilliant.   The decor, really brings you into the feel of a Spanish restaurant. The ever flowing sangria is delicious and the food was great.  Here's a breakdown of what we had:  Patatas Bravas - as good as they get but how hard is it to make Roasted potatoes, brava sauce and aioli taste amazing?!  Alcachofas Fritas- Fried Artichokes, Maldon Salt and Aioli - I swear, I have almost called a dozen times to just grab this for take out. I dream of this dish.  Ensalada de Col Rizada con Queso Salado - I am not a fan of eggs but this Kale, Ricotta salad with pine nuts and crispy poached pee wee eggs was pretty tasty  Morcilla y Garbanzos - Blood Sausage dish... I've never had it before and I'm not sure why I was so wary of it. It was fantastic.  Paella Antoni Gaudi - who doesn't love a veggie medley with their Paella.   There's nothing better than going to a great restaurant where you can forget about where you are and focus on the great food and great conversation. It's funny how rare that can be."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing.  I prepaid for six of us (as a surprise for my friends). I also talked with them about having the chef come out and talk about the food.  What a disaster. For how much it cost, I was expecting some substance to the food. Instead we got some appetizers, some of their skewers in bread, and ... that was it! No chef, and barely any food.  For what I paid, I legitimately expected 2x the food (factoring in their own menu item costs).  It's OK - miscommunication happens. Afterwards I expressed disappointment, and they said they would send me vouchers so I could come again and that they would do better.  Except the vouchers never appeared. So I asked again. And again. And again.  Six months in and after over half a dozen \"oh sorry, we will send it now\" I've thrown in the towel. I'm highly disappointed - it's insulting to continually promise something and have it never materialize."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this place 3 stars so that it averages with my previous review.  We are still at 3.5 stars.    I was really looking forward to trying the paella with rabbit and snails, a combination not commonly seen on menus.  Is that probably why it was taken off?  Not too popular I presume?  A little too exotic?  Ah well.  The chef came to offer a variation with rabbit and also highly recommended the duck confit with dates option.  We were sold on the duck.    I haven't had paella in a long time.  I remember there being a lot more rice and a lot less ingredients.  It's the opposite here.  There wasn't much rice, but there were plenty of beans, dates, various greens, and a large duck leg which we pulled apart and mixed into the rice.  Boy, was that ever tasty.  Flavours were so rich and hearty.  I felt it was a tad on the greasy side but hey, extra goodness doesn't hurt!  The portion size was probably just right for two people.  I almost forgot the tapas appetizers.  The stacked fried green tomatoes were my favourite.  The fried artichokes were a bit sour to me but I enjoyed the combination of flavours.  The grilled chillies with the tomato sauce weren't bad, I just wish there were more for $10.    The service was reasonable.  Water was regularly topped up.  We were asked if everything was alright, if my DC wanted more wine, etc...  Not overly enthusiastic service, but still okay.    There's one thing I don't understand.  Why are the tables so small when you're serving tapas?  People who order several dishes can't possibly fit them all on the tiny surface area, especially on the two person tables.   Again, I've had another lovely dinner outing with good food and great company.  It was a 3 hour dinner date!  Maybe we might even go on a second!  :)"}
{"text":"The Spot:  Just west of Trinity Bellwoods on the north side of Queen you will find Carmen - Cocina Espanola. The warmth and inviting atmosphere of authentic spanish cuisine pours out of the open concept kitchen, fills the dining room and bursts right onto the street. Although the restaurant business can be cut throat, competition isn't the motivating force behind this convivial meeting place. The ideals which keep Carmen grounded are humility and honesty. For executive chef Louis Valenzuelar, and the entire family at Carmen, its not about attaining perfection, it's about doing the best you can by being true to who you are. Carmen is a place to get familiar not formal.  What's Really Good:  The food in a lot of restaurants is put on a pedestal. As foodie culture enters the mainstream, it is not uncommon to see people more concerned with dissecting the gastronomical feats on offer or instagramming untouched plates than enjoying the pleasures of good food with good friends. In case you're unsure of how this 'casual dining' thing is supposed to work, instructions are printed right there on the menu: \"Spain's celebrated rice dish [paella] is meant to be shared in a lighthearted and casual manner.\" This community oriented mentality underscores the entire menu at Carmen, the idea is to use great food as the vehicle for bringing friends together. From the finger food tapas dishes to the salads and entrees each dish begs to to be passed around and shared together. The focus is on the people and the experience, so when the shrimp are served straight off the grill and the paella is topped with an entire lobster, don't let the shells intimidate you, get in there, get your hands dirty and enjoy the moment! (yolo right?)  You'll Want to Know:  There are two distinct, but equally charming sections at Carmen, complete with their own menus. The main dining room is open to the kitchen and is where you really get a sense of the love and camaraderie which goes into every dish. At the front of the restaurant is a chic cocktail bar. This is the perfect area to meet a friend for a drink or stop for a bite off of the Menu Del Bar (aka Late night snack menu, aka greatest words in the english/ spanish language). Even after a full meal we couldn't resist tasting a few items off the Menu Del Bar, the home-canned Sardinas En Tomate were simply delicious and certainly worth stopping in for; who knows, it could be the start of a beautiful relationship."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Excellent service, delicious food and great atmosphere. I'm sad they don't offer individual paellas but everything else is great."}
{"text":"One of the best Paella I have had in a while. Paella del Carmen is loaded with fresh seafood and everything is cooked to perfection. Prawns in the paella are to die for. We ordered 6 dishes including the paella (takes 45 minutes, so make sure you order it first) and everything was divine. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic! After working in Spain a a tour guide, my expectations of tapas in Toronto are fairly low, as I'm usually disappointed. We had pretty much every item on the menu at Carmen last night and every one was excellent, right down to the mandatory churros. I'll be back for paella!  My only problem at all was ahead if the time, as their website doesn't seem to be very mobile-friendly and I wasn't able to reserve online"}
{"text":"I am upping my review by one star, but I'm actually giving 3.5 stars.   The Fabulous Karen L. and I came here to eat the Snail and Rabbit Paella. We had plans for weeks to go, and Lo and Behold, despite the fact that their on line menu still listed this dish... the menu had changed and it was no longer available.   Needless to say we were a bit disappointed, but opted for the Duck and Date Paella. The Server was kind enough to offer to go in the kitchen and see if they could still make the Snail and rabbit, and chef Luis came out and apologized in person and offered to make us one with rabbit, mushrooms and artichokes. This did sound great, but we opted for the Duck. For starters, we had the fried green tomatoes which were served in a delicate tower layered with tomato and feta. These were both delicious and well presented. The Fried artichokes were a favourite of mine from the last visit and did not disappoint this time. We also had the peppers with tomato sauce and they were simple, but the tomato sauce was bright and had a nice acid balance with the bright green peppers.  The Chef returned to ask us if we wanted bread to sop up the tomato sauce. Yes, please.  Paella was very good. The duck was served as a confit leg on top of the wine soaked rice and a lovely seasonal offering of fava beans, sweet peas in the pod, chewy dates and dried apricot with fresh basil.  I initially thought that the basil overpowered the dish, but it proved to be a winning combination. I also loved the burned rice on the bottom. We scraped at that stuff for ages and it was worth the effort :)  Again, Chef Luis appeared to ask us if we liked the paella and we nodded that we enjoyed it very much.  Now, the lack of stars is for a couple of things. When I made the reservation, I asked for the booth. When I arrived, the person seating me did not acknowledge this and did not give me the booth. The booth sat empty for an hour and a half and they ended up seating two ladies there, so they weren't saving it for 4. If the host/server had at least lied to me and told me that the table was already reserved, I would have been okay with that. But there was no attempt to acknowledge or honour the request.  They charged me for 3 glasses of wine instead of 2. A mistake which they quickly fixed and I get that if two servers are helping your table, the likelihood of this happening is pretty high.  Overall, there is just something about the service and the vibe here that is lacking. Our server wasn't inattentive or rude, but not really very warm. I felt that the chef cared a lot more than the servers. I think that the food may be a bit more elevated here, but Torito takes the bull by the horns when it comes to great service and a more convivial environment.  The food takes the cake here. Thank you Chef Luis. You're a talented man who showed a lot of class tonight and took care of us very well.  I'm looking forward to hearing Karen's re-take on Carmen."}
{"text":"Overall, my experience was alright. It was really crowded for dinner time and the servers rarely came to our table to check up on us and see if we needed anything. Our table had 9 people and it was hard to hear my friend, who was sitting across from me, even when he was raising his voice.  The food took about 45 minutes to come out. It was flavourful but not really worth the wait or money. We got two different paella where a quater of the rice were stuck on the bottom and on the sides. I also got the green tomato dish which was good but not great and also the salmon dish (I forget the name) which was much better and flavourful.  Overall experience was okay but I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Really great food. We went for dinner on a Sunday night at around 5:30 pm and it was surprisingly empty.  We really enjoyed that.   The food was really great. The only problem I had with it was some of the items were really salty, the artichokes tasted amazing a first but the saltiness and the line flavour was too much for us to finish it  Overall our favourites were the Ceviche de pescado blanco, the Pintxo de pulpo, and the tomato verde Frito"}
{"text":"The Hubster and I had dinner here last night for our anniversary and had an amazing time.  First of all, service was impeccable. Everyone had a smile on their face and were more than happy to help explain the menu to us. They were also very nice about the Hubster trying out his Spanish on them. Food was great. We ordered the octopus, which was incredibly tender, the deep fried artichokes, which were very very crispy and delicious, the beef heart, which I just loved and the pork tenderloin, which was a bit too salty. I couldn't have the cheese, which apparently cut the saltiness, because the Hubster said that his pieces were fine. We also had the coconut ceviche, which was a bit too coconuty and the jicama con aguacate, which was very very cold, but super creamy with a nice bit of sweetness and tanginess.  It was a really pleasant experience and most of what we ate was super great. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a craving for Paella. The Carmen paella came loaded with shrimp, chicken, chorizo, mussels, and clams. Oddly enough, I wish there was more rice for the sauce. I also wish there was more of a kick to this dish to make it have more of an authentic flavor. It would be great if they offered a spicy option?  We also had the garlic shrimp appetizer, and the shrimp was delicious. Simple grilled shrimp just like they do in Europe."}
{"text":"Expensive but a good experiance. We came at 530pm on a sunday and was the first one there as it had just opened.   We ordered the Carmen paella right away as it takes 45min to make. It wasnt as good as I expect it to be for 50$ a pop. It was bland for me and wasnt exciting. I could have made it at home tbh...  We tried both of the fish ceviche for 20$ - it was good, very zesty. The flavours were very unique. loved the different kind of chips provided.   Kale salad - it is exactly what it sounds like. Kale salad with pine nuts and ricotta. Nothing special or different but good nonetheless.   Breaded green tomatoes - fav dish of the nighy, love the crispiness and the texture of it all.   pork tenderloin - dont get! it was just a thick cut of dried pork. no flavour, did not enjoy at all.   squid with chorizo - came out in a skewer, the best paet of it was the chorizo. the squid fell flat of expectation.   Churros for dessert - wasnt as crispy as it should be, soggy and doughy.  All in all, would i return? no. Simply because it's out of my budget and for the price, I expected the food to be awesome. Service was great, ambience nice. it cost 4 of us 330$ after tax and 15% tip with a $65 bottle of wine and 3 cocktails."}
{"text":"From the owners of Torito Tapas comes Carmen - a Spanish restaurant serving up some delicious comfort food and tapas.  They have a short cocktail list with a few beers and wines.  The decor is quite eclectic with Royal Doulton-esque figurines along the wall. The open kitchen is in the middle of the kitchen.  Started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes topped with a too-tart red pepper, feta and corn chutney.   Next was the Avocado in Jicama - pureed avocado that's perfectly seasoned and sprinkled with fried tortilla bits in a Tostitos Scoops like jicama.  Delicious!  For our daily veggie intake we opted for the Kale Salad with toasted pine nuts, raisins, Ricotta Salata. This was topped with a fried quail egg that could've used some seasoning. The salad overall was enjoyable.  For our main we shared the Paella del Carmen - scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp, chicken and chorizo. No regrets here! Loved scraping up the rice crust from the bottom of the pan and the chicken and sausage fats really flavored the dish nicely.  The seafood was cooked perfectly - not one thing was overcooked.  For dessert (3 options total) we decided on the Atole- a saffron infused milk and sugar dessert \"beverage\" served with an almond-pecan biscuit.   The damage was about $90 before tax and tip but I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick drink and some apps Two of us shared some tapas based off the reviews here The green fried tomatoes weren't that big of a hit Artichokes were great though Great flavor for the bacon wrapped dates but were too mushy for my liking, too sweet also The tapas were pricey also, but overall good experience"}
{"text":"Nice quaint place for Spanish tapas by Ossington and Queen. We came here for a date night and the ambiance was great for that. Now that I think about it, looking around the restaurant I saw lots of couples here as well so this can be recommended as a great restaurant for date nights!   The decor reminded me of places around Spain (trip I did a few years ago) and the menu had a wide variety of items to choose from. We ordered three tapas and a paella to share, and the portions were just right to hit the spot. My favourite cocktail is full moon, and the one here was spot on. I would come here even just for the drinks!"}
{"text":"A must try. Will be returning for paella. Had fried artichokes with aioli that was fresh, salty and fried. A tomato and bread thing that was like a super ungarlicky/deconstructed bruschetta. The fried green tomatoes with a corn relish tastes surprising, a textural experience, shockingly filling and an absolute delightful experience. The fresh charcuterie board was simple with three meats, a duck prosciutto that was the stand out for its richness and perfectly cut thickness. The steak tartare was subtle, presentation was adorable. Finished with Spanish churro donut and omg they were delicious and went great with the super fresh housemade sangria. Really expensive. But the ambiance, decor and outstanding food it's quite worth it. Very romantic but also great for a crowd. The one drawback besides the price, the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, maybe it was bc it was easter Sunday tho! :)"}
{"text":"We chose this place for my wife's 33rd bday. We were looking at many other places in town but decided on Carmen because we felt tapas was the most date compatible way to have dinner and enjoy each other's company, especially since we had our little daughter, date nights have been on a slight hiatus as of late.  We reserved in advance (as I would recommend you do) and were initially seated at a table inside between two others which we weren't terrible pleased with but were quickly moved to one in the little garden out back... Much better. The food was a mix of classic Spanish tapas as well as the kitchens own twist on things. The drink menu is interesting albeit a little pricey, but hey!  The food is well prepared, fresh and rife with flavour. Graze your way through the menu and most of all don't be in a rush and do it with someone you like :) It took us back to our vacation in Spain and made for a memorable night."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. This place has cute decor and is very busy but sadly I don't think I would go back because the food portion to price is way off. I know it's a tapas restaurant but tapas should be between 8-10 for the portions and then you order multiple dishes. The tapas menu here us approx 14-17? I know it's small size plate tapas but it's a little pricey if you have to order so many dishes to get full. I only tried the paella which we were told by the waiter feeds 3-4 people. This was the smallest paella I've ever seen and for the price of $68 it either needs to be around half the price or it needs to be double the size. The toppings were skimpy, I mean chicken and chorizo are not expensive meats so I believe they can add more especially since this is a sharing dish but the thing that erks me the most was they had the thinnest layer of rice which was half burnt in the pan and we had to scrape that in order to get some rice. We shared this with 3 people and I think we may have had 2 or 3 tablespoons of rice each. I felt like I was in on the tv show Survivor lol. Anyway after the waiter picked up our scraped empty dish he asked how everything was and we told him you know it wouldn't have hurt to add more  rice, it's the cheapest thing to add. Then he said well you know this dish is enough for 3 to 4 if you get a bunch of tapas as well. It would have been nice to know that before and maybe we would have ordered other things instead because it's quite pricey to order the paella plus a bunch if appetizers as well. Anyway, looks like reading the reviews several other people commented on this as well including others at our table that ordered the same thing. Owners if you're reading this my advice would be to add double the rice, a little more meat or reduce the price and say it feeds 2 as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  It's not cheap, but it's worth the price.  Amazing tapas dishes, and the manage to make vegetables savoury and delicious!  The Paella though is why you come...."}
{"text":"the place  is nice and cozy and specially works for group dinner. we had grilled artichoke and Carmen paella. artichoke was not good. had a lot of mayo on it and did not worth the price. paella was  OK. not great for $45. too salty . you may wanna tell them while ordering not to salt it much. waitress was nice and smiling and cooperative. cocktail was fine too. maybe we should have tried other foods. this review is for just one and first visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of people (20+ people). The person who organized this dinner is good friends with the staff (including the chef), so we were treated really nicely. Appearance wise, the restaurant has a nice rustic feel to it and the patio out in the back is really relaxing. When it starts to get dark outside, the staff light up the tables with little mason jar candles and turn on hanging lights above.   For appetizers there were an assortment of olives, peppers, squidink bread, prosciutto, shrimp (which was delicious), potatoes, fried artichoke, white fish tacos (wrapped in a lettuce wrap - which was also delicious), friend green tomatoes, croqueta, tomato salad (amazingggg!), flying fish, and a potato-cheese-sausage concoction  For dinner we had the paella negra (which is black ink paella with grilled octopus - to die for!), paella del Carmen (which is shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, chorizo, chicken and saffron paella - also delicious)   To drink I had the white sangria which was really good.   To sum up, I really enjoyed everything I tried and felt that all the dishes really complimented each other. The service we received was unbelievable and the chef's personal attentiveness made the experience all that much better. I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a very cute place.  My friend recommended this place to me as it was her 3rd time coming back.  We didn't make reservations but they were able to accommodate us and sat us in the front Bar area since it was only two of us.  Which was OK. The seats were an oversized bench style seat with cushion. Quite comfy.  But I realized it's a bit uncomfortable where we sat as we were right under the hostess stand and when people came in for their table, they would be sending right behind /infront /on the stairs overlooking while we at.  Probably best to call and make reservations first.   Our waiter (who is from Madrid) was very quick to welcome us with menus and explanation of any of the food choices.  Giving is an excellent description and choices.  As well as telling us what is traditional in Spain and the areas of Spain in which to find them.    We ordered 4 items plus drinks.    A.  The Ceviche on Boston Lettuce - very fresh tasting.  Served \"taco\" style with lettuce as your shell.   I'd highly recommend this dish!  It has great flavours.  But then again, I really love Ceviche. B.  Brussel Sprouts with bacon/dates - interesting flavour.  A bit on the sweet side.   C.  GAMBAS AL AJILLO \"ESTILO CARMEN\" (grilled shrimp)  - delicious.  well cooked and full of flavour.  Not the easiest to eat as the shell was still on. D.  PULPO (Braised Octopus with Spicy Tiger's Milk) - this was cooked to perfection. The octopus was not overcooked. Great sauce. Served with chips.  The only issue I have with this dish is that there was not enough octopus meat.  Our drinks were great - Spanish Ceasar and Margarita.    Our service was fantastic. The drinks came to us fairly quick as well as the food.  Our waiter also checked on us a few times throughout the night.    All in all, I had a good experience here and would come back to try some of the other tapas on the menu.  Or the Paella - but not that this does take 30-45 mins ahead of time so if you are going for this - I'd recommend mentioning this right away or on your reservations."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I especially enjoyed the octopus and the cauliflower dishes. Ordered both the sangria's, but they both felt a bit watered down."}
{"text":"I met the owner of the restaurant at a show, and made sure it's a owned by a Spaniard. We finally went there for dinner.  We sat outside, in the patio area - very beautiful and quiet considering it's downtown.  All the good we had were amazing. We started with some tapas and ordered Paella Carmen.  We had the following tapas; short ribs, skirt steak, bacon wrapped dates, ceviche - they were all excellent.  Well worth another trip there."}
{"text":"I stumbled on Carmen after an evening stroll around the Trinity Bellwoods area. We were seated right away up a small flight of stairs near the back. The lighting and ambiance is dark with a beautiful mural painted wall close to where I was seated. My friends and I weren't too hungry (we'd had a full meal and lots of beer at the Trinity Brewery a few hours earlier) so we opted for one tapas and the seafood paella to share among the 3 of us at the horror of the server - he suggested that the paella and 2 tapas each would have been better for 3 (hungry) people. The paella would also take 45 mins to come according to our server - which we were okay with. I'm glad he warned us ahead of time! We also ordered a bottle of Cava to keep us satiated while we waited for the main course.   For the tapas, we got the octopus marinated in sherry vinegar. It was delicious, although a tad too sour as the vinegar overpowered the taste of the octopus. The octopus itself, however, was very tender. The paella was absolutely wonderful. You can really tell it was made fresh and that the basil leaves were just tossed on and it wasn't sitting around. I'm not Spanish nor do I eat much Spanish food so I can't say if it was authentic or not but it sure tasted scrumptious to me!! The flavours melded together nicely from the seafood to the rice and that last crunch and burst of flavor from the fresh Italian basil leaves. It was an entr√©e to really savour.   When we left, I noticed nearly every table had some sort of paella ordered so I could tell it's definitely a winner. I will be back to get more of the menu!! Attire is pretty casual although I did see some dressed up people celebrating birthdays. This restaurant is also nice for dates as the dark ambiance makes it very romantic."}
{"text":"we had a pretty good start last Sat night - with the four of us on the patio -- food was pretty good with the Paella being tasty - but very skimpy in size for $60.  we were told it would feed four people but it was barely big enough for a small 1/2 full side plate for ea of us.  we also ordered five appetizers and again, small servings and so so.  the worst of it was the service - we were outright ignored after about a 1/2 hour into the night.  it wasn't overly busy - only about 1/2 full outside, and our waiter didn't end up coming back to see us - but instead sent a rather grumpy woman who seemed put out that she was waiting on his table - as he was \"busy\" at the bar.  when we went to the bathroom - he was behind the bar but not doing anything - as there was no one at the bar.  the bill was around $200 per couple or $440 for the four of us - and we came home hungry and exasperated - not a place i'd recommend in spite of hearing such good things -- maybe an off night??? overall disappointing"}
{"text":"The best vegie paella that ever eat before! Green Paella with Brie Cheese spinach and broccoli.   The services is very friendly!!! And good looking guys in the bar and the service!  All the tapas that We try was amazing #pulpo #patatas bravas #tomatesverdes #ceviche #palomitas #croquetas #tartar #pezvolador was absolutely amazing and the desserts #rice pudding and #cremacatalana of #chocolate is the perfect combination for finish a excellent dinner!   The bar has a special charming from spain and a huge variety of wine!   The price is just for the food!  If you have a special condition or allergies they prepare the food gluten free, vegetarian or without nuts!   Carmen has all rhat you need to eat and share a perfect time in family with friend or a date!"}
{"text":"Really bad service with average food. A huge fail for the business owner as she asked us to leave if we were not eating more food at the same time she is removing our plates of overcooked paella. #fail"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was extremely bad, which is probably the reason why I and my friends will not be returning to this location, especially given their competition on Queen st. West.   Situation: A friend and I arrived to Carmen to eat on the patio. We arrived ahead of our other friends to grab a nice spot on the patio for a total of 6 of us. The restaurant was completely empty inside, with maybe 4 larger tables occupied on the patio. The waitress wanted us to sit on the picnic table, which was set up with 4 plates, for four people. We requested to put together 3 smaller tables instead of the picnic table, in a nice shaded spot. My friend said that the picnic table seemed to be small for 6 people, the waitress rebutted saying that they've seated 6 people on it before, to which my friend rebutted that it would not be comfortable, especially because the sun was blaring in that spot. (Side note: why are there 4 plates set up on the picnic table if it is meant to seat 6 people???) The waitress made a fuss and ended up putting together 3 tables on less-than half filled patio. From this point on the service went downhill. 5 of us in total ended up showing up. The restaurant does not split bills- this was fine as we understand it is a tapas place- the tone which waitress responded with as she was walking off however, was not appreciated.   What concluded the worst dining experience for us was the fact that we were handed a bill with a pre-populated tip of 20%. Their rule is that 18% tip will be automatically added to parties of 6 or more people- again fair...However, as I mentioned, the waitress served 5 of us, not 6. When this was brought to her attention, instead of apologizing, she said that she put it on because we told her there was going to be six of us (?!?!?!?!?). Did she serve 6 or more people? No. Her entitlement was repulsive. Furthermore, when we brought to her colleague's attention the fact that she added a 20% tip instead of 18% after she wasn't even supposed to add it, his response was \"Ok, i will let her know.\" One of my friends did not even end up tipping the waitress. I was about to take away my tip as I was so bothered by the lack of principal, lack of care, lack of service, lack of everything essentially.  This service I would have expected at a festival of some sort while I waited in the hot-dog line, not a restaurant that serves quality food at higher-end prices. Bill for 5 people was about $250. If their service was this bad with less then 10% of the restaurant being full, I wonder what would have happened if they were remotely busy?  Will never return or recommend this place to anyone. there are far better places to eat and enjoy, especially on Queen st.  We should have picked up on the quality of service we were about to receive when we walked into their empty restaurant."}
{"text":"They just started the brunch menu (a month ago), and I had it four Sundays in a row because it so good.  I've tried three dishes and all were awesome. The battered fish sandwich is my favorite. Their home made chorizo sausages are in my opinion the best in the city. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. Loved our meal here and the space. Loved the fried artichokes, seared trout in tiger's milk, gambas (in chili garlic oil), lomo, and patatas bravas. Didn't really care for the octopus ceviche nor the brussel sprouts. Price point is decent as well and the space is large and gorgeous. They even have a back patio! Great service too even though the person who took our reservation didn't relay the message for a candle for our birthday diner. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We chose Carmen for my husband's birthday dinner after hearing really positive things about it from friends. We had two bottles of sparkling water, the Paella deal Carmen, and three Tapas: Esquites de Maiz, Tomate Verde Frito con Queso Freta,Ma√≠z y Pimientos, and Alcachofas Fritas. We split everything between three people and it was the perfect amount. Our reservation was for 7pm and we were able to choose between sitting outside or inside - the staff were very friendly and accommodating. It was very fun to order our Paella, which takes about 40 minutes to prepare, and enjoy our Tapas as we waited. The food was delicious - we enjoyed it so much that we would probably order anything off the menu in the future and trust that it would be amazing. Our meal came to about $115 before tip. We had a fabulous time and look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"For those who never knew, Carmen is the same owner of Toritos tapas bar in Kensington, hence it is no surprise the quality of food plays a melody on your taste palate. A popular choice in the Trinity Bellwood area of TO, CARMEN serves out your traditional Spanish dishes ranging from various tapas to your choice of paellas!  First impression was the cute bar decor right by the entrance and its chic new age contemporary design from the portraits, boutique chandelier of bottles, to the huge mural on the wall. The service was excellent, and it was a nice surprise to see Carmen bringing the 'Paella de Carmen' to our table.  :) lol  Paella de Carmen; mussels, clams, shrimps, scallops, chorizo, chicken and safron 5/5!!!!!!!!!!!! Segovia Restaurant, seems like you have competition in the city... this dish was a delight to my taste buds! Aromatic, robust and versatility of flavors left my foody partner and I speechless...lol. Plus to top it off the presentation was top notch! In addition we both ordered the Primicia joven tempranillo to compliment the meal.  Dessert cookies with dulce de leche! Que rico! Wish they sold these babies in boxes to buy and take home :( 3bite cookies with Dulce de leche filling..pure bliss! Like I just died and went to IBIZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I'll be back pronto"}
{"text":"Ok first of all, the food was great! I really liked it, but the service... Lacking. I made a reservation before hand, because I was going to bring a larger group with me, which logically is the right thing to do. We arrive ONTIME, And we didn't get a table until about 30-40 minutes later!!! What's the point in me making a reservation then? The staff kept holding us off saying that our table isnt ready... But then they should have set it before we came anyways. I'm a hostess myself, and I know the pressure but seriously this was not acceptable. I made sure I was there to check-in and they made us wait by the bar. I hope maybe if they change I can come back."}
{"text":"Carmen is added to my list of Toronto restaurants that are overpriced, sub par, yet given tremendous hype for some bizarre reason.   We shared the shihto peppers, braised octopus, fried green tomatoes, and patatas bravas.   Nothing was memorable (in a positive light) whatsoever. The octopus had a mushy, pasty consistency. It was acidic, and the flavours were actually bad. The shishto to peppers were ok, really nothing special. The green tomatoes were so unbelievably sweet, and the flavours were so unbalanced. And the patatas bravas had minimal flavour. The service was way too fast. It was clear that the wait staff were in the business of flipping tables.   We didn't even bother complaining about the food. It is obvious that the kitchen staff have fundamental issues. I would not recommend carmen to anyone."}
{"text":"4 stars for one of Toronto's top bartender and chefs,  wonderful cocktails,  great selection of delicious authentic veggie and meat tapas,  white sangria,  memorable paella (love Del Carmen) and sexy atmosphere.  1 star off for that witch of a hostess who is rude,  condescending,  argumentative,  and very unapproachable.  Been there twice and I much preferred the first time when we were served by the attractive and bubbly male bartender. Will carefully choose the nights I revisit."}
{"text":"Feeling in the Christmas mood to catch up on my yelp reviews. .. so why not start off with my most recent visit to carmen!  I've been wanting to come to this restaurant for  while but unless you're coming with a larger group, it's hard to order their paella. Nonetheless, reservations were made for 2 on Christmas eve eve... and I was still excited. The interior is cozy and spacious.. not what I expected looking from the outside or having been in other queen west restaurants.  It definitely had a comforting Spanish feel. The tables ranged in sizes.. some similar to longer communal tables for larger groups. Knowing we were not going to get the paella tonight... we looked thru the tapas menu and started w. the ceviche and mussels. the ceviche came quick and accompanied by taro root and sweet potato chips. there was a bit of heat and a good amount of white fish with each bite. it was a promising start. we waited a long time and still no mussels. I was hoping to let our server know but no one ever came to see how we were doing. by the time we got someone's attention, we were pretty hungry only to find out that the mussels were out. booo. we ordered the shishito peppers and grilled shrimp... both which I thought were okay.... but once again.. the service had pretty much disappeared unless we waved down someone. we decided to get the dulce de Leche cake w carmelized  bananas on top.. it was really tasty but I thought a little steep for $10 a slice.  With 2 a cocktail each, the bill came to $90. Based on the portion sizes, I felt that the meal was overpriced. I was disappointed by the service.. and although the server was super nice, he lacked service and attentiveness. I will come back.. but for a larger gathering.. hope for a better 2nd experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere, the service was very friendly. Most of the items ordered were delicious and they were all well presented. The appetizers/tapas were good and priced reasonable (sortof) for a Tapas restaurant.  The paella was a bit disappointing in regards to the portion/price.  The taste was ok. It's a nice place to bring a few friends out to or to impress a date (if she doesn't tease you for overpaying, that could be uncomfortable)."}
{"text":"OMG - this place makes the most succulent Pulpo a la Gallega!  I love octupus and this little sucker was delicious!  I came here for dinner with Jenny, a fellow Yelper, on a saturday night. The RSVP was for 7pm and at that point in time, it was very quiet. WIthin the hour, the place was packed!  We had a myriad of tapas, and the ones that stand out, the most in my mind, are the seafood ones. So exquisitely made! Funny enough, the ones that took the most time coming out! The food was delicious but the conversation, was enriching, fantastic, so much laughter! We were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of tapas especially paired with a nice glass of wine or beer. This may be my go-to spot from now on if I am ever craving Spanish tapas.  I have walked passed this place many times over the years but it never really caught my attention. From the outside, it is small and obscure but once you step in, it is ever so inviting. It's warm, cozy and rustic inside. The seats are comfortably laid out with plenty of space between you and your neighbours and the vibe of the space is cool and calm.  Aside from atmosphere the food is spectacular and service is courteous and on point. Anything from salads, proteins to seafood, each dish is delicately prepared with care and attention to details to ensure you get a well balanced experience one bite at a time. Each little dish is completed and complimented with various combinations of flavours and textures; crispiness with silkiness, fattiness with acidity, earthiness with herbs...etc. Everything was great with maybe the exception of the octopus but that's a personal preference. I find it a bit too tender the flesh seems to fall apart a bit -- which is quite an unfamiliar texture one would expect from octopus.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how affordable the meal was and the portion sizes. You do get more bang for your buck.  This is a must visit if you are seeking a warm and cozy place to hang out for the evening while enjoying fantastic tapas."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and cozy atmosphere. Ordered the paella as soon as we arrived (takes approx 45 min to make)   Ordered the deep fried artichokes because from previous reviews, it was a \"must order\" it was very good but there wasn't anything crazy about it.   The breaded green tomatoes topped with feta cheese and the chutney were delicious, as well as the white fish ceviche.  Our paella was a little under seasoned, and had minimal toppings. I've had better. I would return, but prob wouldn't order the paella again"}
{"text":"Loved it at Carmen's :)  Cute bar up at the front of the restaurant and nice decors all around - comfortable seating. We've asked our waiter for his recommendations and he named some great choices.  Sangrias were yummy - can't taste much of the alcohol (which I like!)  Alcachofas Fritas - Fried artichokes: I really liked this tapas - the artichoke was very fresh.  Also, my bf is not exactly a veggie-lover but he really liked this dish so it definitely says something about it haha  Marinated pork tenderloin with Piquillo jam: THIS WAS SO GOOD :D the pork tenderloin was very soft, not chewy at all. I'm impressed by the way they cooked this dish. It's especially yummy when you eat the pork tenderloin + sauce + cheese combined.  Paella del Carmen: THIS WAS ALSO SUPER YUMMY :D I tend to get bored of one taste easily whenever I eat something (I like variety) but this paella.... I can never get bored of the taste! The Chorizo was delicious - really puts an accent on the paella. The rice was amazing as well.  Service was excellent.  We'll visit again to try the other paellas on the menu :)"}
{"text":"It was Ok.  Probally won't be back.  I found it very over priced for what you get.   Drinks were good.  Average 15 bucks for a drink at a restaurant. I agree with all the reviews that the Artichokes was amazing.  That was worth the price.  The pork was nothing fancy.   And the bacon wrapped dates....I like Patria's better.    Service was good though.  That was 5 star.  Not a long review, but nothing really stood out.  Except the Artichokes."}
{"text":"I don't know what to add that has already not been said in other reviews.  Hands-down this is the best Spanish food place in Toronto.    The fried green tomatoes were delicious, however it is the Paellas that are absolutely stellar. The Carmen Paella is absolutely amazing, even though quite pricey.  If you never had one - have one here first - you will get a perspective on all others.    I've had Paellas before and never have been much impressed - but this one was amazing!   perfect balance of sea food and other ingredients.    My only remark would be that the rabbit pasta was very salty, but that's easily forgiven because of the amazing Paella.  If you come here and don't have the Paella (yes, it is pricey, I know, but worth it) - you are doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"Carmen, carmen, carmen!  This newly opened Spanish restaurant on Queen W had set some high expectations for, as I had heard nothing but amazing things, and Carmen definitely met those expectations!  My party and I tried a large arrange of the tapas, as well as a couple of the desserts & paellas.   The standouts for me were:  -Fried Artichokes with salt & aioli. Mmmm. Incredibly delicious. Fried yet still not too greasy like many fried foods can be. -Jicama con Aguacate: bite sized jicama shells filled with creamy avocado. Little bites of avocadoey heaven. -Paella de Montana: rabbit, escargot, artichokes, & tempranillo. The rabbit was cooked to PERFECTION - asbolutely amazing. The rice in the paella had those nice & crispy delicious bits like you can find in a really good paella. The flavours in the paella all worked so well together. A++  The Carmen Paella with shrimps, clams, mussels, scallops, chorizo, chicken & saffron, was good, but fell a little flat for me in comparison to the Paella de Montana. I think it may not have been cooked long enough as it was more runny than the other Paella we had.   I'd say the Paella de Montana and tapas were on a different level than the desserts & way outshined them. We had the creme caramel, which was okay, but nothing special, and the Amole (sugar and milk infused with saffron, with pine nuts and an almond-pecan biscuit) which was yummy, but again, not on the same level as the rest of our meal.  This place is pretty loud, so if you want to sit and have a conversation with a group of friends during peak hours, be prepared, you'll be shouting a bit.  All in all, we had a GREAT experience here. I want to come back to try all of the delicious tapas. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"Simply the best! A bit noisy but the food is amazing! The staff were very attentive and friendly. Try the fried green tomatoes!"}
{"text":"What i love about about this place is that everyone is spanish and not just any spanish, spanish right out of Spain. This makes me trust their tastebuds.  It truly felt like i was in a little resto in madrid. With the soft lighting and the great attention to detail when it came to their d√©cor it totally set the mood..   Cocktails were great especially their tequila ones..one tequila,  two tequila, three!!!    I just wish i had a bigger appetite to try more food than just the delish octopus paella, bread and olives,  and crispy bread with tomatoes but that just means i have to go back!   And that i will!!!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant in the hipster west end. Went on Saturday night for group of 6 Ambiance: 4 Service: 3 Food: 3  For the amount of money we paid - I expected a lot more for service. She didn't bother pouring the sangria for us - didn't really ask how our food tasted.   No music whatsoever - okay not a big deal Decor is your typical west end \"rustic\"/\"casual\" feel - pretty nice but nothing special   Food: Patatas bravas - sauce was great but the potatoes weren't crispy enough - 3/5 Pinxto De pulpo - octopus/chorizo/potato/pickeled-pepper skewer on a toast. Really gotta eat everything together otherwise it doesnt taste special at all - 4/5. Beef tartar - best thing we had - could use a tad more mustard to give it a bit more kick/pop but I guess that's their \"take\" - 4/5 Lobster salad - that thing just doesn't belong to a Spanish tapas joint - overcooked cold lobster with a few lettuce - 2/5 Shisito peppers with tomato sauce - shisito peppers should be treated simply and the tomato sauce just doesn't belong period - needed a bit more seasoning - simple sea salt and acid - 3/5 Grilled shrimp - enough said - 3/5 Paella del Carmen - for 50$+ this could easily be a the most overpriced and underwhelming paella ever: clams not washed (had a lot of sand), mussels not fully opened and overcooked, and most important thing of paella - NO socarrat!!!!!!! 2/5"}
{"text":"you have to check this out.  the service is amazing and the food!!!!! make sure to order the  food right away!"}
{"text":"I've tried several Queen West spots for Sunday brunch (Swan, Parkette, Drake, Niche, etc.) so decided to try this newly opened spot for something different. It was not very crowded, which was nice. Although I'm sure this place will fill up once word gets out. The space is warm and inviting with some small tables up front and long communal tables at the back. There's also a round booth for about 4-6 people that would be perfect for a group! The decor is old school Spanish, yet simple.   Service was very attentive and friendly. They took our coats and the chef was walking around to see that everyone was enjoying the food. Their lunch menu is small -- just a few paninis (fish, vegetarian, jamon serrano, lobster) and an egg dish. My DC had the eggs, which was like scrambled eggs with potatoes and toast ($8) very tasty, because they mix it up so the egg yolk is sort of mixed in. I had the roasted tomatoes, red pepper, kale pesto, and manchego cheese panini, which came with potatoes and a tangy sauce (sort of like patatas bravas). It was super-yummy and the bread they use was really fresh and soft. Espresso here was good too.   I will definitely try to come back to try their dinner menu! Looks like it would be a fun place to stop by after work for vino and tapas!"}
{"text":"One of the best Spanish restaurants in Toronto. The vibe and authentic food makes this a hit on any date night. A perfect place for any foodie and the lineup to get in is crazy.   Book well in advance."}
{"text":"One of the best Spanish restaurants in Toronto.  Atmosphere was really nice, I really enjoyed the lighting and the coziness of the space. The atmosphere was very open and was very welcoming  Service was great. The staff was so caring, and would  always came and checked up on things ( asking how the food is, filling water, etc)  Food was great, had the classic paella and it was worth the wait. The paella was cooked to perfection and all the seafood was delicious.   Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Pros: + Really tasty and quality food + very nice atmosphere  Cons: - pricy, but worth the experience.  Ambiance (4/5 stars): Spacious but romantic ambiance.  They dimmed the lights party way through the night.    Food (5/5 stars): 5 of us had 7 starters (a few were recommended by the waiter, the rest were chosen by ours).  They were all amazing.  The shrimp was the most outstanding. We also ordered 2 paellas, Carmen and Mediterranean.  Both were outstanding.   We were completely full and satisfied by the end of the meal.    Service (5/5 stars): The waiter (who was spanish) suggested a few wines and the real Spanish food.  He came over to ensure everything was good was not interrupting our conversation.   At the end he gave us sherry as desert on the house.     They do take reservations, paid parking on the street"}
{"text":"Stunning interior design, and perhaps one of the best designed restaurants I've ever been to. The bar is completely separated from the eating space, and there is a seating area for those having just drinks.   We couldn't enjoy a meal since we were stuffed from having dinner at The County General- but we did order the Paella with Mango & raspberries along with lattes. It was delicious, and very lovely looking :) The bartender was very friendly, and chatty. Fantastic service, and dessert. Will return for the mains. Beautiful restaurant- run, don't walk here. Perfect for dates."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just spent our Valentine's Day dinner here and could not have been happier. Every one of our tapas were delicious and inventive. We were treated to a beautiful booth, as we made a reservation early. Our server, Marina, was courteous and knowledgeable. She made our Valentine's Day even sweeter. I can't wait to bring everyone I know, to this lovely spot. Happy Vday TO!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! This is one of the only restaurants that I have been to serve Basque Cidra, which was amazing !"}
{"text":"Great service, authentic food & classy atmosphere.   We were a party of 4 with reservations at 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday and the restaurant was still buzzing with people. They seated us promptly at a nice, comfortable table - perfect for our party.   The highlights: Fried artichokes with salt & aoli. So delicious we ordered seconds! The wine list is also impressively well thought out - a detail I always appreciate at restaurants.  We will definitely be back to spuport this wonderful restaurant in the community!"}
{"text":"Still excellent and I love every morsel of food this place puts out - put they need to get creative in the dessert department. The brulee and flan is just ok and not like the rest of the meal. Churros y chocolat? bunuelos? Crema cataluna? You guys get the idea."}
{"text":"I would never come back here again because of the service!! I was in the area and wanted Spanish food so I ended up here... the food was not bad but the service was horrible. Our male server did not once fill our water, or ask if we were doing okay, got our orders wrong, dropped a knife on my chair and almost dirtied my pants while cleaning up BUT did not apologize or even utter a word, did not ask us if we wanted receipts after we paid, did not thank us after our meal ... instead he just left. When we were calling him to get the machine, he ignored us and then when he came back, we loudly said \"excuse me\" again and this time he replied \"I KNOW I WILL GET U THE MACHINE\" which was not what we were trying to ask but sure. We ordered the ceviche white fish taco on Boston lettuce and realized we were charged extra $7 for another \"taco\" because apparently they only come in 2 and we had 3 people so without asking us he just gave us 3 and charged us extra AND assumed we were okay with that. No. NOT OKAY  On top of all this, my friend got an upset stomach the next day.  My friend said in Spain people do have bad service so maybe that's why but dudeeee this is not Spain.. it's Canada."}
{"text":"Slowly making my way through most of the Spanish restaurants in Toronto, and this one definitely sits towards the top of the list. Carmen had a very impressive menu of tapas, balanced with both traditional and contemporary offerings with a focus of quality and uniqueness. Highlights included the fried green tomatoes and the bacon-wrapped dates. The real showstoppers were the paellas. We opted to try the more traditional signature paella with seafood, chorizo and chicken, which was exactly what we were hoping for. The second paella was a little more unique, and had escargot, snow peas and was topped with a half rabbit that was slow-roasted until perfectly tender. The rabbit paella was the real star of the show and definitely not something to be missed."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment from the time we got there to the time we left. Our 900pm reservation turned into 920 which for me is always annoying. It's just poor front of the house management. I asked the bartender for a drink and he said one minute and then ignored me and served others. Then there's the meal which took the 45 minutes they said it would for paella (no big deal) but my tapa never showed up. Apparently some potato issue. When I told the waitress I no longer wanted the appetizer, gave me some attitude. Who wants an appetizer after you have dinner? They did end up removing that from the bill though so that was appreciated. She also brought it out to the table when it arrived (after we had finished the paella) and said 'someone should eat this'. The paella itself was very average. The sticky rice part at the bottom was lacking. It was pretty greasy, and nobody at the table enjoyed theirs. My app was also greasy and the chorizo was salty. The other apps were also pretty average. I would say I would not go back and tell you to spend your money at a better Spanish spot in town."}
{"text":"The food: 4/5. We stopped by for a late night snack and some cocktails. Ordered Ceviche de pescado blanco and croquetas de jamon serrano y manghego. The ceviche was unusual, but still nice and light. The ham and cheese  croquettes were great too, but very small.   The service: 5/5. We sat at the bar and tried several gin cocktails, all of which were well balanced. The bartender was very friendly.   Overall: 4.5/5. Great spot to get drinks and/or food. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Carmen is charming but lacks in execution.  I love my tapas and Spanish themes but every dish had a basic culinary error. Quail was cold, cheese un-melted, my avocado dish lacked a textural component etc. The bar was every friendly however and made a solid cocktail. I also enjoy their sherry list and would probably go back for just a drink."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican restaurant. Stumbled upon this resto last summer and is still amazing to me. The food is fresh and reminds me of authentic Mexican paella!   Ordered the Jicama with fresh avocados and the paella. The paella was well worth the wait (about an hour). I highly recommend trying this joint if you're a fan of paella and Mexican food in general."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. From outside it looked nothing specisl. Once inside I was suprised it was very spacious and hip looking. Service was awesome! Food was delicious and would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Comparable to Patria."}
{"text":"So far the best Spanish food I've had in Toronto yet. We (2 girls) ordered the octopus skewers, patata bravas, quails, kale salad and also the Carmen paella. The amount of food is perfect for two people and the taste of all 5 dishes are all tasty! Very different flavours yet all very delicious. I would recommend all 5 dishes we ordered. Service very good but the waiting time is long when it's not so busy in there. Liked it and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and reasonably priced. Loved the ambiance and will be back.  Their Ceviche is amazing."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a wonderful and delicious experience we just had at Carmen. Everyone was very nice but Diane was our server and she was very attentive and informative. We ordered 5 tapas for the 4 of us and each one was really delicious.  I loved the croquettes, they were better than ones we had in Spain a year and a half ago. And the artichoke tapas were also wonderful. We had paella also and it was delicious. The flan for dessert was the best I've ever eaten. We had met Chef Luis earlier that day in their newly opened cafe next door to Carmen (really good sandwiches).  He was so friendly that we decided to eat at the restaurant that night. A great decision.  We are from California but we hope to be back again soon."}
{"text":"Love this place - it's cute, cozy and intimate. Nice bar too! Paella del Carmen was delicious."}
{"text":"Best Paella in Toronto and good price! Just it took me 2 hours to get a paella because they were so busy. They told me it will take a 45 min though.. I lived in Madrid , spain for 2 years. So I know whats good real paella . really nice service from a guy  madrile√±o. And their paella is just great great! Paella is from valencia but their paella tastes very similar but they need to put more azafr√°n(the spice of paella reallt expensive) Gambas was so good!! Grill shrimp with garlic. They have a nice music and nice bar.  its open kitchennso you can inside and its so clean.  Love here!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Friendly staff, great food, and fun atmosphere.  It's the perfect neighbourhood restaurant.  I can't say anything bad about it; I try to go at least once a month.  Oh, and ake sure you order the tomatoes."}
{"text":"Tapas ! Yah.  Jicama with avocado : delicious , a must try  Crispy shrimp: average Peppers: wish it was more spicy  Seafood paella: ok this was tasty yet not as big as i thought  Tax and tip: alot"}
{"text":"My family and I just had a dinner here and everything was so good. Started with a warm welcome from a receptionist, the waitress was great and the food was awesome from appetizer to dessert. The chef was friendly, I took a picture of him. Next time I go back in Toronto, I'll definitely go back here."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Dropped by for a quick drink before dinner. Bartender was really friendly and helpful: asked what I felt like drinking this moment (fruity and refreshing) and ended up suggesting I try:  Margarita de Moras Negras ($14) was balanced and delicious! I just love the Tajin (chili and salt) rim!  Chit Chat with the nice bartender a little while enjoying my drink... and I guess I would be back again to try out some items on the menu next time! Paella!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredible service! I would definitely go back. The food was quite nice and unique. The service was exceptional. We tried couple of tapas and one paella. The server communicated really well at the beginning that paella takes longer to be ready so he asked us to order it first. We had their cheesecake and chocolate tart for dessert. It was the best cheese cake I ever had.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and atmosphere. Went with a big group and every single one of us loved it. The farro paella was exceptional, ditto for the fried green tomatoes. Also tried the \"Matador\" and \"Gypsy Manhattan\" cocktails- both were delicious."}
{"text":"Great patio in back. Food is always served quickly and always great quality. One of my favorite hidden gems in the city"}
{"text":"I've been to Carmen several times in the past few years, as I am a big fan of Torito in Kensington Market, which is owned by Carmen, as well.   I was lucky enough to have secured a reservation on a busy Saturday night to celebrate my daughter's 24th birthday.   Carmen herself was working busily on the floor, seating customers and creating a positive vibe in the space.   She made a recommendation on the vino, 6 Sombreros from the Rioja region. Was quite good - not very Rioja-like, but tasty none-the-less.   We went with tapas rather going the paella route.   Patatas Bravas Alcachofas Fritas  Tortilla (while it's not on the menu, I usually ask for it to be brought over from the Mercat)  Padrones (unfortunately, none were hot, but still wonderfully tasty!) Jicama con Aguacate Ceviche Blanco  Gambas al Ajillo   Everything was very authentic, and in-line with my food experiences in Spain.   We also shared a nice almond torte for dessert.   Service was just right.  Not bothersome ... very helpful ... and knowledgeable.   I also enjoyed the conversation with our server, Cristian, who is from Mallorca, where I had spent a fair bit of time over many years.    Great place, great food, and amazing people.   It's the most authentic Spanish restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"First, full disclosure: The owner's bulldog and my bernoodle are best friends. That said, let me rave about this restaurant that offers authentic Spanish tapas and paella. I was there last Wednesday with four friends, two of who are Spanish. We shared a mess of tapas which were great. The Pintxa and lomo were especially memorable. In addition, the paella negra, rich with tender pulpo was excellent. Service was friendly and helpful. I will return."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was lacking.   Loved the artichokes - never had them quite so good! Also tried the avocado jicama but it was underwhelming.   Cocktails were superb: highly recommend the bandito - nice smoky flavour with the mezcal balanced with some spice and salt on the rim. Perfection!  Service was mediocre at best. The server was uninterested and mildly rude which left a bad taste."}

{"text":"Carmen (@carmensayz) have been open a few months now and have heard only but good things. It's after all from the duo behind Torito Tapas, Veronica Carmen Laudes and Chef Luis Valenzuela.   The 70 seats space includes a bar at the front and a main dinning room with an open kitchen.  The space is rather eclectic but yet very clean and quite modern.   There's no long drink list here; only 4 cocktails, white/red sangria, a few beer and a short list of Spanish wines plus 5 sherry offerings.   Red Sangria $14  ~ Have to say the sangria was good but really nothing special, I usually prefer white sangria but Ben ordered this for me instead.   Federico Cocktail $12 ~ Tequila, Lemon, Sage, Serrano Syrup ~ Ben ordered this and although I love the strong Tequila, the sage flavor was just as strong and was too overwhelming for me.  The menu here consist of both tradition and modern interpretations of Spanish tapas dishes and made to order paellas to choose from.  Tomate Verde frito con Queso Feta, Maiz y Pimentos $7 ~ Was expecting a more acidic tomatoes which lack the pop of flavor, but everything else tasted great together including the sweet pepper and corn chutney with the powdery feta which separate each tomato layers.    Alcachofas Fritas $7 ~ Fried artichokes, Maldon salt, aioli ~ This was one probably our favorite dish of the night, with a just thin and light enough batter to seal in the delicate moist artichokes flavor inside    Morcilla y Garbanzos $10 ~ Blood sausage, chickpea sofrito, apple, fried egg  ~ Everything on this plate was delicious, I end up wiping the plate clean with bread. ~ The blood sausage was very moist, soft and flavorful and perfect with the apple.    Pimientos de Padron con Salsa de Tomate $10 ~ Shisito peppers, tomato sauce ~ I personally love the simplicity of this dish, some are mild and some packed some intense heat. We only end up getting2-3 spicy ones, wish they were all spicy     Sardinas en latadas $6 ~ In house canned sardines, roasted tomatoes, olive oil ~ Isn't this a cute presentation although I bet the can have been use a million of times. Love the sardines but with the crostini are not that hard.    Paella del Carmen $35 ~ Shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, chorizo, chicken, saffron ~ It takes 45 mins for this made to order paella, make sure to order right away. It looks like a huge portion but it was rather shallow and the two of us finish it without any difficulties.  ~ Love scrapping the burn bits at the bottom of the pan and all the seafood was cook to perfection.  Verdict : ~ Love everything we had and can't wait to go back to try some other dishes. ~ Great attentive service and Great food ~ Love that they have both traditional and modern dishes"}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming staff from the start. The chef is a real Spaniard!  But didn't like that the tables are so close to each other, very awkward when you're practically part of your neighbours conversation.   Foodwise - yum! Got fried artichokes, patatas bravas, pan con tomate, Catalan pork & beans, grilled shrimp (we got the last order of the day!). Everything was quite tasty, although the pork was a little overcooked. The beans it came with were in some sort of maple syrup sauce I think; it was like a Spanish pork and beans! The portions here are good and 2 people can definitely share (unlike other tapas places \"coughPatriacough*).  Pleasantly surprised to find good Spanish food here!"}
{"text":"While I was on vacation, from out of town, Carmen was recommended to me by a few locals. I was not let down.  We had the amazing paella and dessert. The food was absolutely delicious. The service was excellent, and the chef even came out to greet us. I would definitely come back on my next visit."}
