{"text":"I went here with a friend for dinner and we had a great time! The food was delicious .I had the Lobster Ravioli and it was perfect! My friend had the Eggplant Parmigana and I tasted hers and it was so good.We shared a salad which worked out perfectly. The atmosphere was very nice and loved the white tablecloths. The service was excellent and our waiter was so attentive which we liked."}
{"text":"Attended a birthday dinner last week at this place. Owner was very attentive to making sure everyone was satisfied.  Our waiter was just as attentive. Meals were great and full of flavor. Very good Italian food for a place in Arizona where good Italian is hard to come by. Definitely would recommend trying this restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!   We've only been to the bar area, but have had several good experiences.  Wonderful value for the money.  The service is stellar, and the bartenders very friendly.   Probably the first place I've been in North Scottsdale that truly feels like a local, neighborhood bar.  The only downside is that they don't have beer on tap.   I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos on Sunday, and let's not forget the bar side music of Roger Enrico.  This is our second time here and the food and atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"After reading reviews here, my friends and I chose this place to go for my birthday dinner. Fabulous! The server was very kind and very attentive. We had plenty of time to review the drink menu before we were even given the dinner menu, so nice! The owner came by and checked on us, he was very kind and affable. And the food was delicious. I had the eggplant parm and it was the best eggplant I've had. Very well prepared. I also had a bite of my friend's butternut squash ravioli, and can I just say, YUM! We also started with salads which were excellent. Overall a great experience and I will be going again!"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about this place, I decided to try it unfortunately, this was a huge mistake.  Although I had a reservation and the place was empty when we arrived, the hostess insisted on seating us in a very small dark table in the back of the restaurant.  There were many open booths (which the owner assigns to his friends, per the hostess) and ultimately the owner came and we were able to be seated at a booth.  Our waiter Roberto was rude from start and made several snide remarks which continued throughout our meal.  He did not listen when we ordered and brought us the wrong entrees which he insisted we ordered.  The meals were not even close to what we ordered.  Again the owner was called and came and agreed to give us what we ordered.  What kind of service is this where the waiter is such a jerk???  The veal was extremely tough.  The pasta and dessert were actually very good.  Needless to say what we thought would be a great new restaurant close to home that we could visit often , was a huge disappointment.  We would not return here or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Outstanding !!!!!!!! The place can be a little hard to locate for first timers but the food was great. I must say that our waiter was INCREDIBLE as well. I would go back soon."}
{"text":"Salad and appetizer very average. Pasta was amazing. Server was so anxious for us to leave so she can sit other people. Won't come back. They charged me $10 for kids food which it was an embarrassment."}
{"text":"Organic, fresh, light, and tasty.  For the quality, price is quite reasonable.  Got the lunch special - panini with a side for $10.60.  Panini was pretty large in portion size (got the Romance on foccacia bread ... yummmmm)."}
{"text":"Fettucini alfredo is unbeleivable, great service.  Can be hard to find its tucked away in the back , Some of the best italian in scottsdale"}
{"text":"I am blown away by this place, they should open up more of them.  Food is amazing, the ingrediants look very fresh and everyone has a smile on, best food in GTA for $10 SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT, fast and fresh. You canactually sit down on a one hour lunch and eat.  Beautiful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pan E Vino is a great Italian place that my family has been to on many occasions for many many years.  The happy hour is one of the best around.  We have known Stuart for years and he is very charming and his staff alike.  The service is impeccable.  Their Lounge plays live music too.  Happy hour in the lounge is where you can find me!  This is a great find if you're looking for fabulous Italian with a dressy casual, friendly, and accommodating service!"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful dinner with the most wonderful service! We started with the Calamari, which was lightly breaded to perfection, split a Cesar salad (yummy dressing). For main courses, I had the Spaghetti Alla Roberto.... shrimp & scallop pasta,,, to die for! And my husband had the Penne Alla Javis, that he says was amazing! Doug, our server, was top notch, so pleasant, making wonderful recommendations for wine and dessert,, we had to go with the spumoni (a fave of mine) which was the perfect end to a delicious meal! If we lived here, we'd be going here on a regular basis! Thanks for making us feel so special tonight!"}
{"text":"We didn't notice the time and they stayed and prepared our food very graciously. The bartender Debbie was awesome. She great!!"}
{"text":"Excellent decor and atmosphere. The layout and service was all great. It made the food taste that much better. I tried the soups, very tasty...salty, but tasty. The chicken panini I had was very very filling and delicious. Loved the grilled veggies on it. The house salad was fresh and colourful. I found the prices high for what it was. My bill came to $17 something for a panini with house salad and a pop, during lunch hours. But I'd go back because there aren't awesome healthy salad places like this around! Great concept."}
{"text":"The food is very good. Nice selection. Quickly prepared. The servers are very attentive as is the host. However, server and host can be over the top with their friendlieness and trying to engage in conversations with you. Servers tend to \"not know\" the price of the specials and push too hard to get you to order extras, e.g., drinks, desserts, appetizers, salads. We have had two bad surprises when getting the check as things cost much more than we were led to believe. The attitude in the restaurant is first class luxury and if you are worried about the cost, then maybe this is not the place to go. Nice to see all the customers dressing up to go out for dinner. Comfortable atmosphere,"}
{"text":"I have never signed up for a yelp account but felt compelled to do so after the worst meal I have had since living in North Scottsdale. My wife and I have been regular customers for dinner at this restaurant for over 20 years. Today, Mothers Day the food was a very substandard quality and also terribly prepared. I have heard that the \"chef\" is new within the past month and do not know why the change was made. I have been here 3 times since the new chef has been on board and the quality has been slipping all month. I have heard the same complaints from some friends who also regularly frequent this restaurant. Needless to say we will not be going back. Hopefully a consideration will be made to replace this new \"chef\"."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this cute place in years and was hoping but not expecting it to be as good as it has in the past, but it was! It's cozy and cute. The place was not even vaguely busy, but it is high Summer so it didn't deter me. We had the pork shank appetizer that literally fell of the bone and it was superb. I had the fresh Basa Fish Almodnine...delicious and my friend had the butternut squash ravioli. All was sooo good I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"I first visited Pane e Vino on the first date with my wife years back. Being our wedding anniversary I decide to surprise her and bring her here for dinner. The restaurant has been updated. Still romantic and warm. We even sat at the same booth.  The restaurant has a great vibe. It was busy yet not overly loud so that we could have a nice conversation rather than yelling. The service staff was professional and knowledgeable . From start to finish we had a great dinner and eventually finished our dinner in the lounge fro cappuccino and dessert. I promised her we will not wait another 10 years to return."}
{"text":"Really relaxing place, came for dinner after we received recommendation from a nearby resort we were staying at. Waiter was amazing and the service was very laid back and we didn't feel rushed at all. Food delicious and highly resonable prices even before the discount we received for being resort guests. Bread with oil and vinegar was brought out immediately. Members of my party had veal and others had gnocchi, all great. To sum it up, great Italian food, nice atmosphere and service, at a good price."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty - came here under fellow Mississauga worker bee Mryem D.'s recommendation and guidance. It's basically a fancy subway with fresh/high quality ingredients. They use ACE bread for the paninis. I had veal and eggplant with a chipotle mayo and a side of organic quinoa. Quite good! Maybe slightly too pricey @ 12$ for that plus a drink.   I'd come here again...def better than most of the places in the surrounding area (chains)."}
{"text":"SO good.  Wish this place was closer to our home, we'd be there once a week."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few days ago. This place is a hidden gem. The paninis are comparable to the ones at Panera Bread, but the atmosphere is much calmer during the lunch hour. The food was delicious, and the staff were very friendly. I will definitely make this a regular lunch break stop."}
{"text":"This is one of my wife's and my favorite restaurants.  We were told about it by another restaurant bar tender for when we wanted Italian. We found Stuart the owner to be charming, the food delicious and our wait staff in all cases have been great.  Special kudo's to Rafael who we ask for all the time.  Even after our first time he remembered what we like and when they took something off the appetizer menu that we loved, a shrimp dish that is excellent, he immediately said don't worry he'd get it for us, and he did.   The veal saltimbucco's are excellent and the pasta is the best.  Maybe I'm crazy but this is one of only two places, the other in LA, where the pasta reminded me of our trip to Rome.  Another kudo to John who took care of us when Rafael was off one night and was terrific.  We have never had a bad meal here, we took my father in law who has been all over the world to GREAT restaurants and it's the place he wanted to come back to two nights later."}
{"text":"I cant get enough of this place.   cauliflower, cheddar & jalapeno puree soup - blew my mind.  chipotle cajun chkn breast panini -  sundried tomatoes, roasted garlic chunks, artichoke garlic spread, havarti cheese, roasted peppers, grilled zuchini and lime juice . Toasted.   HEAVEN!  $12.00 gots me the most elite italian style lunch ever done properly in mississauga ;)  xoxo M."}
{"text":"Found this place via restaurant.com and was pleasantly surprised during our vacation in Scottsdale. The place is in a non-descript strip mall off of Pinnacle Peak so it is off the beaten path a bit.  But, don't be fooled - it has a very nice atmosphere and the wait staff and management are very friendly and accomodating.  The tables are a bit close together, but I could see why they are trying to pack more people in.  We were in a party of six and had the calamari appetizer and bruschetta - both very good.  The dinner dishes we ordered were chicken marsala (YUM) , linguini with clams, veal tortellini (lots of veal on the menu, which I am not a fan of but was told it was very good) and seafood scampi.  The bread is also very good so we were too full for dessert....next time for sure!   Next time we are in Scottsdale, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious spicy cauliflower soup (purée not cream so healthy too).  Also had the kale salad with chicken- had chickpeas, avocado, strawberries and walnuts.  Was HUGE and all sooo yummy!  Service was fast. A tad noisy and a touch overpriced"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed dinner here many times and this is our first review!  The service is spot on even in a usually full restaurant.  The food speaks for itself!  Delish!  Do not miss the Tiramisu!  WOW!  We had four spoons, one order, just the right amount!   Then we all moseyed into the lounge and enjoyed a one man entertainment set that was just what we were looking for!  This restaurant is a fantastic find!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok, we are back after a few months. The hostess greeted us like old friends and actually remembered us. We were surprised to have our friend Rafael as our server and he remembered us also. We started with a split Caesar salad  and had 4 appetizers including a new one...WOW the salmon cakes. And finished with the Panna e Fruita for desert.  Still an excellent dining experience.   FYI, the bar is also great place to hang out, meet friends and dine!  Ok, October now and just had dinner great again. Tiramisu was great very authentic. Steve was our server, excellent service great knowledge with some light humor. We had a member of our party that suddenly had to skip dinner for an appointment so we brought her a dinner home. Steve and staff made sure that the pasta was packed separately from the meat dish and the bread and butter were included as was a small container of fresh ground parmesan for the pasta.  Oh, the two huge meat balls were excellent. 5 stars again..."}
{"text":"This is old school northern Italian, done very well. The old school professional service was also refreshing -- our server actually knew how to properly serve a bottle of wine, which I don't often see in Scottsdale. We had the scallop & shrimp appetizer, veal cannelloni, a chicken dish, and the apricot-almond bread pudding. I say \"a chicken dish\" because while it was juicy and tender it wasn't a stand-out, but both the app and the cannelloni were simply outstanding -- well-seasoned and not overcooked. The bread pudding was good, but I wouldn't have it again...too many calories for not enough pay-off! Wine list was also nice, with some good values at the top end, but I'd like to see more quality wines at the $45-65 price point. Also, the bread was just OK. For a place with \"pane\" in the name, I'd expect fantastic bread -- but the prices are up there, so we're not there to fill-up on bread! We'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were anxious to try this place. Big letdown. Overpriced, and not that great... Borderline bad.  Try at your own risk. If your expecting anything authentic and good, go elsewhere.   Try Giacomo's Italian Restaurant on E. Mallard Creek Rd.    Look them up..."}
{"text":"Our first time at Pane e Vino and it was everything we could have hoped for. The Cioppino was as good as it gets. Our server was the perfect blend of attentive but not hovering. They also  haven't tried to cram too many tables into the restaurant so you don't feel like you are eating with all of Scottsdale - some other nice restaurants in the area have made this mistake and love that Pane e Vino has not fallen into that trap given how popular they are.  Wonderful, wonderful on all aspects!!"}
{"text":"While pricey, the food, wine and cocktails were excellent. We had the cioppino and a sauteed seabass special. Both were delicious - the cioppino was easily enough seafood for 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"This gourmet sandwich shop is tucked away in a plaza that few people would be able to spot easily. For the nearby offices, this is a popular spot to go to for lunch. Make sure to get there before the lunch rush or you might be waiting in line for a while. It may be an odd spot surrounded by industrial buildings, but the place is always busy during lunch time.  The shop serves a great range of soup, salads, and a plethora sandwiches. You get to pick the bread you want for the sandwiches; which is freshly baked. You can also pick either the soup or salad to accompany the sandwich. This costs about $11.   This is a place that wouldn't be out of place downtown. The decor is modern, and the many windows let in natural light, making the place bright and airy. The smell of toasted sandwiches fills the air adding a nice aroma to the place; which makes you mouth water in anticipation.  All the sandwiches and soups I've tried here have been delicious. If you are looking for a great lunch spot come here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow.... Amazing food.  $9 vodka tonics are a little steep though...."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've been to this place, I just love it. I've tried different varieties (veal striplion and Brie , smoke salmon, veggie trio, volcano vegan...) and they were all good. I love their fresh salad and soup too. Glad my workplace is not far from there."}
{"text":"This is a delayed review from a visit in March. We were in town with friends from Chicago and had an average meal. The restaurant was not busy and service was fine, nothing special. I would say the same about the food. Don't know that we would chose to go back."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times over the past several years and have found the food to be very good and the wait staff equally attentive.  Owner tends to hover, so you know there is a watchful eye in the house.  As others have mentioned, the burnt cream as I call Creme Brulee is great!    We've enjoyed most items on the menu, but really enjoyed their Chicken dishes.  I myself really enjoy the carpaccio (raw beef) which was very tasty and fresh.  And, prices tend to be on the very high side, given the near Troon location  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place went so down hill, it's below ground level.  It's dirty, and the food is horrible.  It's VERY expensive with very small portions.  I predict it will be closed soon, just like the place right next to it.  I won't be going back.  Check out Bice (across the street), it's awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Fresh organic salads Two different soups/day  Fresh and light sandwiches which you can customize!  It is a great spot which is in the middle of an industrial area.  There is seating but if you want to sit down, make sure to arrive before 12 - the lunch rush can make ordering 20+minutes.  I have not ventured much in my choices for sandwich as my favourite the chicken picante is delicious. This sandwich has eggplants cheese peppers and chicken on your bread choice. All sandwiches come with a side salad or small soup.  I find their purée soups are normally better. My favourite is their butternut squash soup.  Most people order takeout but their seating (cafeteria style) holds about 30 people.  The workers are very friendly and will let you try the soups if you can not decide! Also join their fb fan page as they post their soups daily!  Although a soup and sandwich will set you back $15, totally worth it in my opinion for a fresh sandwich and filling soup! Definitely a great spot :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I actually haven't even had an entrée...just their  Creme Brûlée, a couple appetizers (Calamari Fritti & Capesante e Gamberi Alla Senape), and a couple select reds.  The Creme Brûlée has a layer of chocolate on the bottom which I would consider the best I've ever had (and this is something my wife gets every time she goes to a restaurant).  I'll probably edit this to 5 stars when I try their entrées since everything else has been so good!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food has always been good in the past but last night was not a great experience. We started off with the idea that we would go for happy hour.... until we saw we either had to eat at the bar or on hi- tops so we decided to take advantage of the two for one offer and ate in the dining room. Our friends wanted apps, salad, drinks etc and we wanted small and simple so being sensitive, they asked for 2 separate checks. For some reason (which made no sense to any of us) our waiter said he couldn't do that. No explanation given. He was quite abrupt and sarcastic.  As far as the food, the tortellini was great but the butternut squash ravioli was not up to par. I'm just giving two stars because of the waiter and his attitude but for the food I would give it 4."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and were delighted!  Elegant, adult, atmosphere.  Warm and attentive service,  The pizzas were very good,  The dough and ingredients were fresh and flavorful.  We shared a mista salad, which was good,  We are eager to return,"}
{"text":"I went here for a catered private party. The venue was very clean. The food was excellent. The staff were very accommodating. I had beef tenderloin with a pepper sauce. I dreamed about it all night after I got home. One of my friends made several bizarre requests like asking for a drink they shouldn't have been able to make based on what they said they had available and asking for a take out container at a catered meal. The staff made everything she wanted happen with a smile. If I had to book a place to hold a party this place would definitely be near the top of my list."}
{"text":"First time ever to Pane e Vino and it exceeded all our expectations!   Amazing service from the Owner the moment (Stuart) we arrived and were seated.  Great help on wine selection and appetizers for Happy Hour!  Our server (Shauna) was top notch and made us feel super welcome.  We will be back again soon for their incredible HH and for a full dinner!  Meat balls, crab cakes and pasta dish were all incredible.   Cheese board looked fantastic.   Looking forward to our return visit.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant and if you have not been there you are missing a wonderful place.  For casual dining, head over for Happy Hour - wonderful food at great prices. Not only the Italian dishes, they have wonderful crab cakes and a killer burger deal.   In the dining room, I've had some great meals - always fresh and delicious.  The owner, Executive Chef and staff are the best!  Find it hidden in the courtyard - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I recently moved into the neighborhood and was getting ready to celebrate a birthday.  Found this thru yelp and thought I would try it. All four dinners ordered were delicious, though the carbonara was on the small side for a dinner portion. The restaurant is very pretty.   The only drawback for us was that our waiter was very disinterested in assisting us and the service was very slow.  Made my birthday celebration just a little less special."}
{"text":"13 dollars for a really bland salad. Overpriced and nothing speical."}
{"text":"Another low point in this gastronomic wasteland AKA North Carolina.  Shrimp Parmesan North Carolina style apparently means a small shrimp buried inside a hush puppy.  It's no wonder this is a chain restaurant haven, the local offerings provide no alternative."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan.  My family and I ate here a few months back.  The atmosphere is upscale in a nice outdoor mall area.  The problem was the simple marinara sauce.  It just was goopy with too much paste.  My second course was good (veal parmigian).  With so many good Italian restaurants in the Scottsdale area, I wouldn't come back here.  The other problem was the waiter who cracked a joke every 5 minutes (this means about 12 jokes) that might have been funny in the 50s but it got old trying to enjoy our meal without his running commentary.  I literally thought someone should have run around with him for a drum roll every time he opened his mouth."}
{"text":"Went out looking for a new restaurant to explore with my teenage daughter.  We had no idea this little gem was hidden in our neighborhood.  Really great service and relaxing atmosphere.  We'll be back, often I presume.    Go for the veal tortellini!"}
{"text":"My new favourite lunch place in Mississauga! A true hidden gem. Fresh salads made right in front of you....wine, bread....need I say more?"}
{"text":"This is awonderful Italian restaurant !  I accidentally made reservations for wrong night but when we showed up Stu graciously found a table for us. I had the  Melanzane Parmigiana (eggplant) and it was the best I have ever had! Everyone in our party raved about their meals. Our waiter, Mark, was fantastic as was Stu! Definitely will go back here!!!"}
{"text":"Have to say this is the best place for Happy Hour probably, in AZ. Food and service elegant and excellant. Hands on ownership always good to see! Friendly bar area in lounge for 5-8 happy hour. The restaurant is elegant with a menu to match. My hubby and I were SO impressed! This foodie Wil go back again and again. Try the pork shanks,shrimp and escargo.......all on the Happy Hour menu. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Very surprised this hasn't been reviewed before.  I went to this place one time.  I ordered one of the specials and asked for it cooked medium well - it arrived undercooked dramatically.  I had it returned and it came back still undercooked and kind of disgusting.  To be fair I might not have ordered the right thing for a restaurant in a strip mall.  But it was one of the daily specials!  Girlfriend had a pasta dish that was ok.  There are better options for italian food but not many in the nearby area."}
{"text":"We went with our friends for dinner and were very satisfied with the food and overall experience  Our waiter was a little pushy and aggressive which was unfortunate,but it didn't spoil the evening  We will definitely return again as we really enjoyed the quality of the menu selections"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine recommended this place.  He said it was one of the best restaurants he's been to....since he's never steered me wrong, we decided to make the drive up to Pinnacle Peak to give it a try.  I'm glad we did...  It was mid-week and when we arrived, it was very slow.  We were seated in the dining room and there were only 2 other tables there.  We were beginning to wonder if we had the right place.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:  Caprese (Fresh Tomato & Mozzarella Appetizer) $10.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=hD15mxhKV-yWyU9iyYSFjg  Carpaccio di Manzo (Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vingarette) $11.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=BOaF8AVIQFJzYGdNXfqaVw  Gnocchi Ponte Vecchio (Potato Dumplings, Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce) $15.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=A0_HsEQNDFSbZinp4yoqkQ  Ravioli di Zucca (Butternut Squash Ravioli, Walnut Gorgonzola Cream Sauce) $17.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=3OI-0dzP0xwu1KNDKg7uEg  And for dessert....  Tiramisu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=AaXI7XufOAU0KVaXVoR7_g  The Gnocchi was amazing and the Carpaccio was awesome.  The Butternut Squash Ravioli was perfectly flavored and the sweet taste of the Squash went well with the sharp taste of the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce.  Overall, it was a great meal.  What a hidden gem!  I hope they get more business so they don't close down.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for lunch during the week, it is perfect. The reason I give it 4 stars is that it is quite expensive... but you do get what you pay for. Everything is made in front of you, the ingredients are fresh and portions are very good. They have different vegan soups every day and sometimes more then one kind. They have lots of options for all your dietary needs. My favourite soup is the butternut squash."}
{"text":"My mouth is still watering thinking about this wonderfully delicious place! MMMMMM.....  I was invited to go to Pane E Vino with a friend who received a gift certificate, and plan on returning many, many times! =) I order Chicken Marsala, which was by far the best Marsala I have experienced, EVER, and its my favorite Italian dish! The Chicken was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of sauce and mushrooms!  My friend ordered the Tortellini Alla Panna (viel tortellini) which at first did not sound appetizing to me, I am just not a huge fan of veil. After tasting a bite however, I was ready to push my Chicken Marsala aside! My favorite dish was second to something new! I can not wait to return to this enchanted place to try something else out of my norm!   I work right down the street, and have never heard of this hidden gem! Such a cute, quaint, romantic little place!  Big Bonus: Customer service was great, and the owner was there hosting himself! I love owner operated businesses."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food. Veal parmigiana is one of my all time favorite dishes, and theirs is top notch. The desserts are great, they have a good wine selection and phenomenal service.   The price is a bit on the higher side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.  The food was below average so called Italian. Not quality ingredients.  Being from Chicago and traveled Europe extensively, I know good food and this is not it.     The service is ok with a waiter that try's to be entertaining, but I really just want good food and service. I don't need a chatty, comedic waiter.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We found out about this place because we bought a restaurant.com gift certificate, but I also read about the creme brulee with the layer of chocolate on the bottom, which intrigued me. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his birthday tonight, and we had the arugala salad, shrimp scampi, prima vera rissotto, veal tortilini, tiramisu, and the creme brulee. They were all wonderful! But I'm a dessert person so I definitely give the tiramisu and creme brulee two thumbs up!  I have to say though, that what gives this cozy gem of a restaurant a solid five stars, is the owner. He was one of the most kind, generous, and passionate restaurant owners I've ever encountered. He was the one who sat us at our booth, opened my napkin for me, offered to take our picture, and the most astonishing and surprising thing of all... was at the end of the night; I had forgotten my credit card at home, so my boyfriend was going to go home (30 minutes away), while I waited there. I was absolutely embarrassed that we had no way to pay, and when my boyfriend was explaining the situation, the owner said absolutely NOT and that we could call him with our card number once we got home or the next day. He asked for no collateral and was very very kind about the whole situation. I have not seen that kind of trusting demeanor in such a long time, and it made me HAVE to write my very first review on yelp because of this. Our server was quite attentive and kind also, but the owner definitely understands the value of a customer's happiness, which can be lost in an economy like this.  I am very happy with Pane e Vino, and I'm sure that all of you fellow yelpers will have a lovely experience there as well. The food is above average, and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Here I am again - giving you advice about great restaurants! Pane E Vino is tucked away, in a shopping mall. The first time you go, you may have trouble finding it. Once you do, it will, quickly, become one of your favorites! Who doesn't love ITALIAN food? We do, and spent some time looking for the right one after we moved to Silverkeaf. Found it with this restaurant. It's not too big - just right. There is a bar area, although we prefer the dining area. Every single person or couple we have taken here, who gave not been before, have LIVED it. The service is excellent. You can actually hear when you are talking! The menu is large enough to satisfy most, and everything tastes wonderful! Nice wine selections, Italian waiters (old school), and it fills up quickly. Fortunately, they do take reservations. I would recommend this to anyone looking (still) to find their \"go to ITALIAN spot\". Look no further!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. I am still very pleased with the food. It is absolutely amazing. There is no other way to describe it. The only thing I have to say bad about this hidden gem, if you are a first timer, do not sit in the lounge / bar. The older female bartender / waitress paid very little attention to us and was not all to friendly. The food mire than made up for the service though. I recommend the Veal Tortellini. You can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal from start to finish. The atmosphere is lovely with sumptuous, elegant grey round high back half booth table , tiger wood floors. Delicious Pinot, escargot, tomato caprese, seafood and pasta, and homemade caramel cannolis with chocolate chips.   Shout out to April for such amazing service."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a birthday party and told them we wanted to take advantage of happy hour discounts and asked when was happy hour over.  The attendant who took our reservation said 7:00pm and said we would have plenty of time if our reservation was for 6:00pm.  We arrived and were seated in the dining room.  When our check come we were told we did not get happy hour discounts because we were not seated in the lounge.  We said we told the person who took our reservation that we were interested in the discount.  The manager said \"that could not happen, we would not have made a mistake like that\".  He was very rude and they stopped waiting on us after we paid the bill in full.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Classic Italian with a fine dining touch! I have never had a disappointing meal here and always look forward to coming in. They recently have done a remodel and it is even more beautiful than before! They also redid the bar area which is great for happy hour! The owners are amazing people and often stop by your table to ensure you are having a great experience! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Feel like fresh salads, homemade soups, & delicious sandwiches made in front of you, i.e. NOT Subway/Quiznos?  In a weird industrial area just south of Britannia, off Hurontario BEFORE 3pm?  If you've answered YES to all questions, pop over to Pane E Vino!  The majority of the food will be paninis, but with a sandwich, you'll get a side salad/soup for $10.60, before taxes.  There are definitely cheaper options out there, but the portion sizes were pretty good considering the price and some - dunno how much - of the ingredients are organic.  (I do not want to assume that they're all organic, since I'm not 100!)  Definitely a healthier option than what's available at the mall or nearby.  Will definitely be back, but it's a bit of a bummer that it's only open for the lunch crowd!"}
{"text":"Since the change in ownership the prices have gone up and the quality down a notch. Here's to hoping the New Year brings a return to old ways."}
{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale this was one of my favorite restaurants Stewart the Manager / Owner is a great guy and always recognized us and took care of us. I like the booths and highly recommend the Chopino or the Oxtail. The escargot is also fantastic as well. The bread comes out with hot garlic oil - yum."}
{"text":"Simply the best Italian restaurant in North Scottsdale.  The menu and food is great and the wait staff is professional.  My wife and I dine here almost every week.  Every thing on the menu is excellent, but try the sea food stew. a half order is plenty and will amaze you.  pastas are also great."}
{"text":"Bright and airy, this lunch spot is a remarkable different spot compared to the rest of the chain restaurants near the Heartland area.  This is far from any main roads and not the easiest to spot... it's a commercial building and a non descript one  too.  It only serves lunch during the week so if you're hungry at noon in Heartland, I completely recommend when you're in the area.  The dining area sits many people and it's quite comfortable and modern for such a old exterior.  It's a nice fast casual set up where you have salads on one side and the sandwiches on the right side.  You can easily just pick up a take out container of leafy greens in the left side refrigerated case and bring it to a lovely person who mixes and adds a lot of the great vegetables to your leaves.  There is over 10+ choices and all of them sound very good.  I love how it's mixed just as you request so nothing is every sitting a long time.  I got the raw kale salad which had chunks of avocado, red and yellow pepper, pecans, chick peas, craisins, and sun dried tomato vinagrette.  It was a huge bowl and all the vegetables were freshly cut.  I loved how the flavours was bright and melded really nice.  I felt so healthy after eating it and it was truly filling.  I also got the daily soup and it was leek and potato.  It was so rich and yet it was vegan!  I loved how it was very flavourful and creamy and didn't make me feel too full.  Between the good sized portions and freshly prepared food, this is a great stop for anyone who is craving tasty and healthy lunches without the ordering insanity you see at the subway."}
{"text":"Stuart who is the Owner at Pan E Vino is awesome! All the servers treat you like you've been coming there for years. Happy hour goes till 7pm so you can always go there after a longs days work. I recommend the shrimp appetizer and the pizza!"}
{"text":"Went in for a fresh lunch alternative, took it to go. Food was very fresh, albeit a tad expensive. But, you get what you pay for. I'll go back for sure! Try the prosciutto !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, we can't stop ourselves from our weekly visits. The panini's are nothing short of delicious and the soups are the absolute best (I can't say that I've been to another restaurant that makes better soups than they do!). I wish they were open on the weekend so I could indulge in their yumminess on every day of the week."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here based on the good reviews. It's really disappointing that for an Italian restaurant with upscale prices to not even make their own pasta. We had the chicken parm- soggy, super salty blegh! And also a shrimp pasta..also salty salty salty! I didn't know they were catering to goats? Or maybe the clientele here is so over the hill that their taste buds have gone? It was sub par food at best-3 entrees one cocktail, one app, over $100!!! Garlic Olive oil  brought out in cheesy metal ketchup containers, old outdated silverware and china, outdated and sad decor.  No thanks!!! I would not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch at the recommendation of a friend.  I called in advance to see if they could provide a celiac safe gluten free lunch. The lady I spoke to said that they had a gluten free wrap and a separate dedicated panini press. They make all the roast veggies in house and although she could not guarantee no cross contact she said the items were made without gluten and all kitchen items are thoroughly washed between each use.  I gave it a shot and ordered the vegan wrap, on a gluten free wrap. However, when I got there I was told the 'dedicated' gluten free panini press was being used to make regular items as they had a big catering order. If you use the same press for gluten free and non gluten free items is IS NOT dedicated. I was irritated as I called in advance to ask about this an was not  impressed that they would say they have a dedicated press when they don't. If you don't have one that's fine, but don't say you do when it is not true. If there had not been that catered order the 'dedicated' press would have been available and my wrap would have been cooked  directly on it, exposing it to gluten as I am sure they tend to use it as a backup when volume is high. Celiac is serious and by deceiving customers it is playing with their health.  Despite this, they were able to cover my wrap in foil before heating in the press and then put my wrap in new foil after it was all done just in case the foil that touched the press had gluten on it. They also changed their gloves multiple times and used new tongs for all the ingredients and a new knife for the spreads and for cutting my wrap in half so that was really impressive and accommodating of them. They were really nice about it too and didn't act annoyed (I know how difficult and time consuming it can be).  I also got a gluten free tomato and beet soup. With a water everything came to $18. The food was really good and happy to say it was definitely gluten free and no cross contact occurred as I didn't get sick afterwards and I am quite sensitive.  1 star lost for the panini press mishap but otherwise I would go back!"}
{"text":"Exquisite spaghetti carbonara and attentive service. Good happy hour and live entertainment. The dining room is a bit on the dark side however it gives it a cozy atmosphere. The only thing I did not care for was paying 10.95 for a caesar salad...I really thought that was a bit on the high side.  On a high note, Stuart is one of the most charming, warm and attentive hosts I know. Pane e Vino is lucky to have him as a GM."}
{"text":"The restaurant is far out in North Scottsdale nestled in a quiet shopping plaza. The host was very welcoming, pleasant and made me feel he values my business.  Also, the service was fantastic. It was a very nice time and I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and delicious food.  The fresh bread that is served was hot and very nice.  I had some Calamari Fritti with marinara sauce. Also, I ordered Petti di Pollo Parmigiana. This dish was above average in my opinion.  The chicken breast was tender and the breading was delicious. I love the marinara.  I had a Spumoni Bomba. It had three flavors and was dipped in a shell of rich dark chocolate. I had such a nice dinner and a happy time.  I look forward to returning sometime."}
{"text":"Had dinner here 5/16.  The food and service was excellent as always.  This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"General overview.... this place is OKAY. I feel like I could get the same food quality for a little cheaper at a different location, but the service is decent and everyone has that overly-friendly Italian personality.   GETTING HERE. This is kind of in a random location and my phone had a hard time finding it. This is a good place for dinner if you are interested in grabbing a bite after golfing in the area or if youre staying at a hotel nearby, but when they say its in Scottsdale... its in Scottsdale,but not near anything else. lol  WINE. So they do have a great wine list and my favorite thing about ordering wine with dinner... is when the servers know what its best paired with! They do change their wine menu pretty consistently and offer specials on house wines too, so wine is a good choice here.   FOOD. I will admit, the Insalata Caprese appetizer was very good and fresh.... and I dont even like basil. I did feel that 14 dollars was a little steep for such a little serving, but hey. thats fine dining for you isnt it?  Whatever you do... Try the scallops. The dish was called Spaghetti Alla Roberto. That was by far the best thing I've had here. It comes with shrimp, mushrooms and a wine sauce. The scallops were perfectly tender and just melted in your mouth. I was never the biggest fan of scallops, but I am now.   SERVERS. They did drive me a little nuts after the 9th time coming by asking if i wanted another glass of wine when I had clearly stated that I was going to stick with water for the rest of the dinner. I appreciate the service, but if someone says theyre done. I think you should just trust their judgement and not try to upsell. Also, If i say I dont want dessert, please stop trying to push it! I was stuffed beyond belief, I didnt want anything else, the last thing I need is someone trying to force a menu down my throat and saying things like \"youre gonna regret it\" as he clears our table. Just....stop that.   I might be back, but its probably just going to be for appetizers at the bar/lounge area, and only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A pretty solid Italian experience. Service was very friendly and the swordfish special I ordered for the main course was very tasty. The noise level in the restaurant is very low which makes for a dinner where you can actually talk with each other without straining your ears to hear what everyone is trying to say.  It was a little hard to find but nothing that different from other places in this part of Scottsdale. The funny part was being at the Walgreens in the same shopping area earlier in the day and not even knowing it was in the same general parking lot for where we booked a reservation for dinner that evening."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. Everything is totally fresh, made right in front of you, and tastes phenomenal. It's definitely expensive, and the hours are strange, but it's totally worth it if you're looking for something healthy + filling in the area!"}
{"text":"OK so here's the thing. I've been all over Italy for business and pleasure. What we have here (Pane e Vino) is train station food in a modern looking pricey establishment. I've had the pleasure of eating there (Pane e Vino) twice and will not be returning. At least at the train station (Milano, Torino, Rome) they slice the prosciutto di parma & galbani provo at the time making your panino. Here, I found the bread wasn't fresh from the same day and the meat wasn't saporito enough for what is being presented and the accompanying price. They're not even slicing the meat appropriately thus compounding the poor lack of freshness. If they're going to be successful in this space, which involves very simple Italian recipes, focusing on authentic and \"FRESH\" cuisine, they'll need to stop cutting corners and start serving food at the same quality like the Italian train stations, which by far don't present as fancy as Pane Vino."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have come to this restaurant.  I come for the eggplant parmigiana.  It's delicious! Last night I had the tomato basil soup as well.  Both were on point.  Their portions are reasonable and plated very nicely. Nothing is drenched in sauce.  They have a crew of mature servers which makes the dinning experience really nice."}
{"text":"Hidden in the court yard of the La Mirada mall located at Pinnacle Peak Road & Pima Road in North Scottsdale is the resturant Pane e' Vino.  For almost 20 years they have been serving great italian food.  Now after a facelift and newly revised menu it is even better.  Stuart and Jill have streamlined the menu and added Happy Hour and Dining room selections that are simply delicious.  A must are the Oysters Casino amoung others to many to mention.  Pane e' Vino is still our favorite place. Dick & Leona"}
{"text":"Right next to my house which is just a bonus because I love this place!   On their bar menu they have this garlic butter shrimp app that is to die for- I always get bread to soak up the extra sauce!   Everything I have had so far has been great! But something that stood out to me was their spaghetti bolognese- nothing something I usually get when I'm at an Italian place because I feel there are so many better options and I can't make it myself at home- but I was with my dad and he likes to keep things simple. I'm so glad he ordered it! It was amazing! I think there is cinnamon in the sauce or something that adds a whole new flavor and I crave it all the time now!  It's also the best tiramisu I have ever had! Only thing is I wish they would carry a moscato so I could have some dessert wine with my dessert! I will just have to stick with a glass of champagne I guess!  As for service, I haven't had a bad experience! It's usually the same people and I don't see a lot of turnover so the staff really knows their stuff. The owners Gillian and Stuart are usually there and make you feel at home!  Whenever people as for good Italian I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant around here.  The service is exceptionally professional and friendly.  The restaurant has a cozy, relaxing atmosphere.  They make the best Caesar salad!"}
{"text":"GREAT veal............if you want veal (any style) this is the place.  It's real veal (not pressed pork) and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the escargot is fantastic, and the rest of the menu is super. Great place to take a date or to just grab a good meal.   Service is great and if you get a chance, have a chat with the executive chef. Great guy."}
