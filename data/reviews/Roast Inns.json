{"text":"Best hot sandwich place in Scarborough"}
{"text":"I love a nice roast sandwich from Roast Inns. They have a good selection of meats and the sandwichs are always very generously filled.


 Aswell as the typical roast sandwiches, they do a full roast in a box. Meat, yorkshire pud, potatoes, stuffing etc all for a very reasonable price. The gravy is delicious also.


 There is no space to eat inside so it's not ideal ikn bad weather but otherwise I would highly recommend Roast INns."}
{"text":"Excellent takeaway roast dinners.


 I've never come across a place where you can have roast beef/pork/turkey in a yorkshire pudding with gravy, veg and stuffing to take away. You can also have them in sandwiches.


 The food is lovely and the prices are reasonable.


 The only downside is they are only open during normal hours, they would be excellent to visit after a night on the beer."}
{"text":"Quite a different type of 'takeaway' in that instead of the usual junk fare, they offer roast meats - beef, turkey, chicken etc - in large filled yorkshire puddings to takle away. As a bonus, these come with all the trimmings you;d expect from a carvery such as stuffing, apple sauce, cranberry dressing and so on.


 Also available are hot roast beef sandwiches, turkey sandwiches and so on, as well as bacon sandwiches, sausage sandwiches, a range of drinks (non alcoholic) and various snack foods such as crisps and bars of chocolate.


 The quality of the food is always excellent. Everything is hot and it never takes long to get served even during the busier lunchtimes. The prices are reasonable, but usually I find people dont mind paying a bit of a premium in order to get something a little different and of quality.


 Highly recommended if you're in the mood for something a little different for lunch."}
