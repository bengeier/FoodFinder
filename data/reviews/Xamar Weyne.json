{"text":"One of the best places to get samosas in the GTA, friendly staff.
Proper African style Samosas with MEAT - Beef, Chicken or Not recommended fish.
Great Value!
Been coming here for years and HIGHLY recommend it!"}

One Year Ago Review: Back about 10 years ago there used to be a Somali restaurant called Sahara on Yonge/Dundas. I used to eat \"Chicken Sughar\" there almost every day - yes it was that good! But then the place all of a sudden closed down... I've since been searching for a Halal Somali place that does good Chicken Sughar, and finally found it at Xamar Weyne! Very well cooked! Praise the Lord! :D"}
{"text":"Best samosa in the city - no potato filler. All beef, onion, spices and some greens. Fried to a perfect crisp. Unbelievable taste. A true hidden gem. Get there now and enjoy a genuine treat !

Update - went back on a Saturday with the lady. Asked to see a menu but the owner said they don't really have one - he cooks up what's good that day. We were lucky And got to try some of the best goat and rice with sides ever. Felt like a true home cooked meal. This place is legendary."}
