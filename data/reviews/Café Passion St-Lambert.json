{"text":"Excellente cuisine dans un décor retro. Excellent service. Menu méditerranéen varie. Grand choix de desserts. Reconnu pour le brunch du dimanche."}
{"text":"Ordered the Benedictine Canard Effiloché and was disappointed. My eggs were over cooked 
Plate was uneventful"}
{"text":"Nothing special. We ordered eggs Benedict with duck and poutine with duck. Duck felt old and tasteless. Servers were friendly but you had to pay inside and wait in the line. It is too pricey for the quality that they offer. Coffee wasn't great either. We went to Pause & Vous the day before and it was way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas aimé l'auto service. L'ambiance est plutôt froide, malgré au chaleureux accueil."}
{"text":"Many people rave about this place in st-Lambert. I have friends from out of town who always go out of their way to come to this place. The food is good, I had a vegetarian sandwich and salad.  I love that they serve hot beverages like coffee and hot chocolate but also serve wine. This allows you to change up the feel of your meal. Are you going for a cozy brunch or a nice lunch date with some friends or loved one? Suits different occasions!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on a Sunday around 10am. I was happy when we got there and there and there was no line up :)
The service was quick and our waitress was friendly. 
I ordered the notre-dame which is basically bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, brown beans, pancakes or French toast, and a bit of fruit on the side. I had no complaints with my food. 
What really impressed me was my boyfriends meal....a breakfast Poutine. Yum. 
It had breakfast potatoes, duck, a hollandaise sauce and an egg on top. Most delicious thing ever. It comes with toast or a baguette, and a good size bowl of fruit. They had a good assortment of fruit and it was all fresh and delicious. 

I will definitely be recommending this cute little cafe to my friends :)"}
{"text":"Excelente sitio para compartir una tarde con los amigos con excelente café y postres."}
{"text":"An awesome café with great coffee, wonderful breakfast, and fantastic baguette sandwiches.  I had the salmon baguette and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Food is always bad service is average....potatoes are old and cold with breakfast the menu is Kinda old too it would need an update and I think that when u almost pay 20$ for salmon benne it's gotta taste good the hollandaise sauce wasn't hollandaise..."}
{"text":"This review is hard to write with the river of drool coming out of my mouth as I think again about their duck breakfast poutine.   

Really cute little place with a great menu, for breakfast, lunch, or just a coffee, that they sell individually. 

Reasonable prices, fast service and ....

And..... HUGE portions. 

I did something I almost never do : not finishing my plate. This was kind of a shock, but I just couldn't make it. Shame on me. 

The fruit cup coming with the poutine was fresh and really good. 

And yes, the poutine was divine. 

If you happen to be around, this place is definitely worth a try. 

Almost forgot about my mocha : yum."}
