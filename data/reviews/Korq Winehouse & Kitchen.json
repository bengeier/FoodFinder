{"text":"Rude. Unsanitary. Terrible. Don't go here, its awful.  I normally would not post anything at all, but I'm hoping to spare others the indignaty and displeasure I experienced here.   Some great restaurants nearby you should visit instead are: Escoba Bistro & Wine Bar (624 8th Ave SW), downtownfood (628 8th Ave SW) or if you're in the mood for pub fare, The Belfry: A Gastro House (630 8th Ave SW) - try the ribs!"}
{"text":"Brutally painful and wet Experience to say the least.  I went to Korq tonight for a friends birthday dinner. It was on the second level which i thought would be nice because its secluded but that didn't much matter because the place was DEAD. I made the intimidating climb up the stairs in my high heels to be seated at the table with 18 some other people. The table was kind of set in a L shape making it a little awkward for seating and trying to talk to anyone. As my friend and I sat down we were attempting to talk to the birthday girl who was in the corner and we were on the end the server comes over with an upset look on her face, this girl was BEYOND RUDE. The C word comes to mind.  To sum up the night (because I don't have the room to write every horrible detail of our dinning experience). Pretty much we waiting forever to order anything, I got wine spilled all over my food and my friends food and my shirt, thank god it was white and not red. We then had to wait again for food because it was drenched in wine. When it arrived my food was totally different then the original plate i had been brought but it was the same dish, (I know this because there is maybe 12 items on the entire menu). So there was that... then our large party gets little to no service and there's no one else in the place... the food was bland, I was sopping wet, everyone's waiting on drinks they ordered half an hour ago. The server leaves the debit machine on our table, which we easily could have refunded ourselves money and stolen from the bar and no one would have known. When my friend and I ask for our bills we got our bill combined with 3 other peoples and the server refused to separate them, besides being shocked that we are actually being charged for our food, we were not informed of the 18% gratuity. So my friend pays cash and I pay debit, then after we have given our payment the supervisor comes over and informs us that our food has been \"taken care of by the house\"... except it was on the bill and we just payed our server. We explain that we paid for it and the supervisor rudely argues that it's been taken care of. After a 5 minute argument about payment she says she'll return our money. The servers hands my friend back her $27 in cash and looks absolutely pissed while doing it. They refund my card $24 and again the server is obviously annoyed because she would have got to keep our payments as tip because she conveniently forgot to tell us the food had been compensated.... No one out of our group of 20 something people was even moderately satisfied with the service we received, and upon leaving at least half the table never got drinks they had ordered over an hour prior. All in all the experience was brutally excruciating. First and last time I eat at Korq. Oh and I will also be sending a detailed e-mail of the experience to the restaurant personally. Which is a huge deal for me being a restaurant manager myself I'm extremely understanding to these kinds of things but from the minute we sat down the whole experience was just plain rude and when things are THAT bad I think the owners should know about it...  I don't know the names of our waitresses, but if I was their manager, they'd be newly unemployed.  Take caution and fingers crossed your experience is significantly better than ours was."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing dining experience. We booked a dinner for 8 and multiple meals were sent back due to errors and substitutions that we did not agreed upon. Even worse, the chicken was raw inside! How does this even happen at what is supposedly a fine dining restaurant. The wait staff were extremely friendly, but are let down by the cooking staff.  Had a billing issue after everything that happened and dealt with the extremely ride owner.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone, there are much better options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Having a birthday so close to Christmas is a challenge; there are usually no good places available since everyone has Christmas parties and such booked. This being said I was quite excited that Korq had availability for us. This however was the only good thing about our entire experience.  Let me just go right into the details. We walk in through a weird curtain and are greeted by the hostess, we then proceed to walk up the stairs and right before we get seated the bar staff start yelling at the hostess telling her upstairs is closed off and why did she seat us up there, she then proceeds to yell back at them and then asks us if the table is ok. It is right beside the stairs and the server station so I point at another table further away and say, can we actually sit at that table (keep in mind we are the ONLY 2 in the restaurant at this time) She looks at the table and back at me and says \"Ya, no you can sit here\" drops off our menus and walks away.  We start perusing the menu when about 5 staff members come up the stairs and start arguing amongst each right in front of our table on how to set up/take down sections, then they proceed to bump our table with other tables and start taking down others in the same area as us. (Also, our table is not fully set either) after that loud and weird occurrence our server came over to take our drink order - but I am not certain I even want to stay due to everything that is happening (I failed to mention the ambience was horrible: hard lighting, loud rap/hip hop etc.) so we ask her for a bit more time....  Two other tables get sat and drink orders are taken in a span of 20 minutes or so and she still hasn't come back to check on us. Finally we make eye contact and that flags her down, we give our drink orders and would have given her our food but she takes off right after I tell her my wine choice.   She drops off our drinks but still doesn't take our food order and then something strange happens, more people start to flood in downstairs (apparently a speed dating/single mixer) and it starts to get really loud. We are half way done our drinks when we get our food order in and finished them when the food arrives. We aren't asked if we want another drink and our water is not topped off.  We ordered the Calamari, Lamb Meatballs and the Margarita flatbread... All would be forgiven if the food was good, it wasn't. The calamari was so rubbery I had to put effort into cutting it with a knife, it tasted boiled and had some olive oil and chopped onions and cucumber on top. The meatballs/marinara sauce was very bland and actually tasted like bottled sauce and the meatballs tasted like they were from Costco. The margarita flatbread was not any better, it was missing cheese on one full quater, was cold and had no spice or pizazz the dough tasted like it was frozen and then baked.   Overall this was a disaster with its bad service, bad food and very bad ambience, not a good way to ring in another birthday."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place has a long way to go. Food was average at best, smaller than expected portions for the \"shareable\" appetizers with the exception of the Korq fried chicken which was really good.  Service was atrocious, took forever, and even forgot to get the requested water 3 times. They were out of at least 2 wine selections we asked for, two menu items were not available, and (which typically is not an issue but it added to the experience)  one wine selection was corked. The only good thing was the $5 glasses of wine on friday till 7pm which was a nice surprise. Sorry, there are much better options out there."}
{"text":"Service wasn't bad especially seeing as our server didn't show up and the hostess ended up taking care of our 17 person party. That is a tough deal for any hostess however her night wasn't made any easier by the fact that they were out of red wine (I'm sure common for wine bars on a Saturday night) and also most of the items on the menu. When our food finally arrived most of it was either undercooked or cold. Overall I'd say Christina was great as was the live violinist but everything else was not worth recommending."}
{"text":"I can give Korq a break on things like not providing menues or water or drink menues for a long time. The limited wine list though- only 14, makes the name Korq Wine House false advertising.  There are more wines at normal restaurants that don't even claim to be a \"wine house\". Tip: If you order a share plate ask what size/ shape the plate is. Desert portions are big enough to share. Amazing ambiance and talented live musician!"}
{"text":"A small group gathered here recently for some holiday cheer before Christmas. From the minute we made our reservations until we left, we received great service.   Between 8 of us all kinds of dishes were sampled including the Gnocchi, Fish Sliders, Charcuterie Board, Carbonara, Lentil Burger, to the Tenderloin. Some of it was lacking on the seasoning, but all in all we all enjoyed our meals. The truffle popcorn was a tasty way to start the evening.  Enjoyed the extensive wine list and being able to sample some of the wines we were not sure about before ordering.   I did find the curtain at the entrance rather odd, but we assumed it was placed to help keep the cold out and the heat in.  A fun place for some bites and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last week with a girlfriend of mine, as we heard it was the newest spot to open up downtown. Luckily for us, it was only a few blocks away from her place so getting there was a breeze! Parking on the other hand...well, we all know what that's like in DT Calgary. Plan accordingly!  When we arrived, I noticed how dead the place was. I chalked it up to being brand new, and we were seated on the second floor below the bar. Our server told us there was another level upstairs, but frankly the stairs looked a little intimidating, so we stayed put. He was very friendly and informative about the menu, and we got straight to ordering.   Between the two of us, we ordered the Italian Bread Salad, the Crispy Duck, Mussels & Clams, the Cheese Plate, and the Margherita Flatbread. Our food was surprisingly delicious - I say surprisingly due to the negative reviews I read prior. I especially loved the Italian Bread Salad and the seafood. The cheese plate was unimpressive - we got the SMALLEST pieces of cheese, which is annoying for the amount you're paying. Our server was very attentive and we made our concerns known, although he didn't really do anything about it.  The weirdest part of the evening was when the sommelier came to our table. He was something out of a 70's horror movie, and we were thoroughly creeped out. He placed a glass of wine in front of me, and when I asked what it was, he said \"you tell me\". Weird. I drank the wine and we laughed but it was totally awkward. The next was the violin player - don't get me wrong, it was beautiful - it's just odd to hear a violinist play along to Miley Cyrus and Black Eyed Peas. It felt extremely hipster-ish.  Honestly, I liked the food so I would probably return if I was looking for a place to have a glass of wine & a bite in the downtown core. It was slightly overpriced for the size of the portions, but it certainly wasn't as bad as I'd expected. The truffle popcorn at the table was also delicious - but way too spicy. I hope Korq gets it's kinks worked out and improves the next time I go."}
{"text":"Jesus H Christ this place is terrible.  I don't know what was worse the service or the bathrooms. Some colleagues and I decided to meet here after work one evening for Happy Hour drinks and appies.  Bigggggggg mistake. We all stood at the bar where a friend had a tab started.  All the bartenders looked so flustered and confused and not one of them acknowledged that we'd arrived.  We waited about 10 minutes until finally we were able to flag someone down. The beer selection was okay, and the wine selection was actually quite minimal considering the god damn place is actually referencing a part of a wine bottle.  I think it was seriously just one page long! We eventually moved to a table where the service became worse.  We ordered some \"Happy Hour\" appies which were 9$ fries that were undercooked.  On what planet is 9$ the price we pay for Happy Hour fries. I head to the bathrooms. I ask myself \"When was my last Twinrex shot?\" Because the bathrooms were a cesspool of disgusting.  Like stained toilet seats and messy counters, I had half a mind to just squat outside in front of the Calgary Parking Authority Building.  These bathrooms were disgusting.  Clean your fucking bathrooms.  I found out later from a friend that the male washrooms were no better, he cited \"shit everywhere\".  I got the bill, charged for an extra beer.  Then the server brought over the manager where I had to re-explain to both of them that I had been charged for an extra beer.  Awkward, table for 3. All in all, this place is terrible.  This is not a great after work place, and given the layout, I wouldn't recommend it for large groups either.  I just don't recommend it at all."}
