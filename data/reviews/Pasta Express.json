{"text":"It's not those romantic type of restaurant, but is more appropriate for casual dining if feeling for the taste of pasta! It's nothing too die for but, it's certainly great if your too lazy to cook on that day and is on a budget. Plus you can take a nice stroll on fleury street during the summer."}

{"text":"We wanted to go out for dinner but we didn't have much time. Enter Pasta Express on Fleury.  This is a solid three-star eatery. Nothing fancy -- a paper placemats kind of a place. Food was tasty but nothing special (e.g. spaghetti was al dente but the bacon in my gnocchi tasted more like deli meat ham than like pancetta). The portions were quite generous.  The service was great. The ambiance was more family restaurant than romantic dinner. We found the easy listening hits (Italian version) hilarious.   We'll probably go back, because it's one of the few restaurants in our budget range within walking distance from home. (Oh, resto Sing Sing, how we miss you!)"}
{"text":"Le nom du resto dit tout : si tu veux des pâtes pas cher, c'est là qu'il faut aller. Les pizzas sont également très bien, le staff est amical, il y a souvent des spéciaux. C'est un no brainer pour un repas de tous les jours."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé mon expérience au PastaExpress.  Étant un endroit spécialisé dans les pâtes, nous avons commandé chacun un plat de pâtes (nous étions deux). Je n'ai pas été déçu, j'ai pris des rigatoni marinara.  Les pâtes étaient cuitent à la perfection (selon moi) c'est à dire la dente. De plus, la sauce était fraîche Avec juste assez d'anchois.  Mon amie a pris un spaghetti sauce à la viande.  Là aussi c'était réussi et la portion était généreuse.  Pour le prix (12$/plat de pâtes), c'est vraiment bien! J'y retournerai pour essayer le reste du menu. C'est un bon petit resto familial !"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!   My mother in law had a hankering for mussels and she said this is the place for it. Walking in I was most apprehensive there were only 2 other tables and both were senior citizens. I thought for sure I was in for bland mushy food.   But I was so very happily surprised! We were promptly seating in a little nook in the corner in case my 4 year old would annoy the other patrons. Our waiter (Raphael) was not only attentive, friendly, and fluent in English and French he was cute too.    We ordered the AYCE Mussels special. My daughter ordered the pizza which she liked very much (she also loved the bread basket) The mussels came out shortly- I had order the creamy shallot sauce and my MIL ordered the spicy tomato sauce. We received giant steaming plates of perfectly Cooked tender mussels!  It was so good We split a 3rd plate of white wine and butter sauce.  The creamy shallot sauce was a little too rich for me but perhaps with a glass Of wine or beer it would have been fine. The tomato sauce was good and garlicky but not spicy at all but turn out to be My favorite of the 3. The wine sauce was just a touch salty.   Oh it was served with fries!   So yummy! I'm sure we will be back"}
{"text":"My experience at Pasta Express was decent. It is nothing fancy, more like a family or casual place you go if you are in the area. But it does the job. The pastas were very good, but I can't say I really liked the pizza.   Service was good but extremely slow. It was pretty clear they were understaffed. The poor guys were running everywhere. They were very nice though.  Basically a solid 3 star. I don't think I would make plans to eat there, but you know it gets the job done if you need a place to eat on the spot."}
{"text":"Servers and staff were friendly. Food is typical but good. Good lunchtime specials for those working around the area.   Plenty of free street parking!"}
{"text":"Toujours aussi bon depuis 1987. La cuisine n'a pas changer si pour dire aussi meilleur à chaque fois. Tout est frais et fait maison, le personnel est très sympathique et généreux. J'adore cette cuisine italienne je recommande à tous de faire un stop lorsque vous êtes dans le coin."}
