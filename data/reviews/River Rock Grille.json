{"text":"I had a BL Fried Green Tomato sandwich with sweet potato fries.YUMMY! My hubby had the brisket and it was perfect. I plan on taking everyone here."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a restaurant where the owners dont care if you are there or not, this is your place to dine. Owner terribly unfriendly and looked down her nose at us. Food is lousy. I had the Fried Chicken and it was just bland, no seasoning. My son had the blacken shrimp  nachos... they were bland too and he wanted some salsa, but none available. Cook insists they are good without them (his opinion, not mine) . Hubby had a steak and you can get much better across the street at the Longhorn and it costs less there. They just don't seem to care about their customers here."}
{"text":"Tasty vittles aplenty!  We started off by talking to the waitress.  My better half wouldn't let me mess with her as much as I usually like, but that's another story...  We asked about their crowd pleasers, and ordered off her suggestion.  The nachos came out nice and warm, gooey with cheese!  They were awesome.  Not over-topped with junk, crispy, good quality ingredients.  We moved on to the main course.  I had ordered the brisket based on the server's suggestion.  She hit it out of the park!  While not a traditional \"Texas BBQ brisket\", it had its own merits.  Juicy, fresh, and done to my liking, the brisket melted in my mouth, not my fork!  The accoutrements were stellar as well.  
For just happening across a place, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of quality food and excellent service.  We're sure to bring more friends and family out this way!
Noosh!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Friendly hostess and waitress. Seated immediately. Very fast delivery o food  Waited less than 10 minutes for food. 

Dining interior was nicely decorated. It gave me an outdoorsy feeling. 

Hush puppies with a tartar style sauce are  served as a complimentary appetizer. These were excellent an the sauce was quite good. The menu has a great selection and everything very descriptive and sounds quite tasty.  I ordered the texas brisket with blackened green beans and sweet potato casserole. The brisket was not Texas style. It was a pulled style meat with a runny sweet BBQ sauce. The meat was not tough , but not tender either.  The green beans were from a can and seasoned with salt and pepper, not a blackened seasoning that I could taste. The sweet potato casserole was good. Some may find it a bit sweet. 

My wife had the farmers market pasta. She said it was extremely bland and tasted like something out of the frozen section. Similar to one of the voila meals. The vegetables were overcooked. The Alfredo sauce was very runny. 

Pricing was on par with atmosphere, but was too high for the quality of food. Beer selection was decent and prices were great. I had a Newcastle for $2.75. 

I may try this place again because I like o give at least two tries before I write it off. There may be other dishes that are much better."}
