{"text":"This was our first time eating here today. The food was delicious. We all enjoyed the food. I have never seen my 5 year old daughter so excited about Mexican Rice. She loved it, especially the chips. My husband and I loved the different salsa's and the complimentary queso. The service was excellent. Even though there was only 2 waiters and a waitress and it was busy, they attended to our needs. I have never seen people move this fast..love this place that is why I am giving it a solid 5 stars..Great food and excellent customer service. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food - I was very impressed.  I had the fajita chicken lunch and everything served was high quality, fresh and well prepared.  They have a salsa bar and I sampled the pico de gallo, and jalapeno salsa and both were very fresh and tasty.  Don't want to draw too much of a conclusion based on a single visit, but I think this is probably the best Mexican restaurant in Gaston County.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"great tex mex food,No matter what we have ordered it was really good.Staff very helpful"}
{"text":"The taquitos rock,  Authentic and delicious ! Unlike many other Mexican restaurants ran by Mexican people the food is prepared from scratch ingredients, not from a large prepared can or jar."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in town that had recently moved there and hadn't had a chance to check out any good restaurants. So we pulled this one up on Yelp and saw it had good reviews and figured we try it out. I had the tilapia with vegetables and my wife had the chimichanga which was huge! Both dinners were delicious in fact my wife claimed it was the best Mexican meal she's ever had. The food was served hot and the service was great. Salsa bar is a plus also."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything different here compared to every other mexican in the area, but it was different. The food here was great.  The burrito I got had the shredded beef well seasoned and full of flavor. Girlfriend thought the decor was odd but I don't care about that as long as the food is good, which it is, that's all that matters for me. Server kept my glass filled throughout meal which is always the best. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. We had looked it up on Yelp and since we were in the mood for Mexican and this got a good rating we thought we'd give it a try. It was fantastic. We started out with the table side guacamole, my wife had the camarones mexicano and i had the tilapia ala diabla, muy caliente!  the service was fantastic, our server paid more than enough attention to us and made sure that we were completely happy with our meal. We don't get over to Gastonia very much, the next time we do we're definitely going to eat here."}
{"text":"Hidden gem here. I am originally from South Texas and this is as close as it gets to good old tex-mex cooking. I had chili verde plate and it was fabulous. Served smoking hot and not covered up with sauce to hide bad cooking, the pork was as tender and flavorful as you could ask for. Owners are very friendly and as accommodating as they can be. I was there in the afternoon and surprised it was as slow as it was. Once word gets out I am sure it will be much busier.  Definitely a find and worth the time for the best Mexican food in Gastonia."}
{"text":"yummy!! So let's just start with my meal haha burrito tejalo!! Steak enchilada!! fajita  nachos!!  So good  hands down best place for Mexicano food!! So in love gonna be here every week  I swear!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying this new place today. I've driven by it a number of times and always wondered so today I decided to find out. I went in between lunch and dinner so it was really dead, but our server was super friendly and accommodating and the guy who greeted us at the door(maybe the manager?) was as well.  I had the lunch chicken fajita tacos and the portion was of course ginormous and they were very tasty. The bean dip they server with the table chips was very good and I loved that they had a salsa bar with so many choices. Everyone should try this place out. I'm not a huge fan of los arcos anymore (the staff literally scares me everytime I'm there Bc they seem so angry) and la Fuente and is just alright. Tequilas is pretty good but now id say that guacamoles is definitely my top pic."}
{"text":"It's just darn good!  Portions are HUGE.  Service is AWESOME!  Sadly , I am a creature of habit.. love my taco salad.  It's a super crusty shell, get the steak.  It's super tender.  Family likes the salsa bar.  The fast service that is always delicious.   Cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving four or five stars, but went with four only because I haven't tried the dishes I usually eat to gauge whether I think the place is special or not (chimichangas and spinach enchiladas).   So since moving to Gastonia, we've made it our mission to try every Mexican restaurant in town, and do to the disproportionate amount of Mexican restaurants compared to the actual size of Gastonia, we know this is a daunting task.  Guacamole's may have caused us to delay our goal, as I want to eat here often and soon. We've been here for dinner and lunch as of this writing.   The first time was for dinner.  I forgot the name of the enchiladas dish, but I still remember the moment our waitress laid it on the table. Steamy, hot, smoldering, covered in melted cheese, cooked to the perfect level of being done. It was exquisite. This place automatically became my favorite Mexican restaurant in Gastonia. Next time I go I'll try to remember the name of the dish and update this review.   We were surprised at how empty it was for a Saturday night, especially since I thought it was so good. They serve bean dip instead of salsa with the chips. A friend of mine went later after my recommendation and thought that replacing salsa with bean dip was so stupid.  I told her about the salsa bar! They have a small salsa bar with a number of different salsa and picco. I'm surprised the wait staff doesn't mention it to anyone. It's not the most visible, depending on where you are sitting I guess.   Speaking of wait staff, when we came in, our waitress seems apathetic and almost annoyed. For some reason, when I ordered my enchilada dish that I forgot the name of, she immediately livened up and said that was one of her favorite and the rest of the night, she was as pleasant as can be... weird.. but you know, it's all good. She was fine.   We've also come in for lunch and they had a small buffet with the basics... fajitas, a few different types of burritos and enchiladas, taco salad, rice beans, you know, the usual. I love buffets so it's kind of a shame they don't do this for dinner hours, but it's cool.   The prices are average, totally worth it in my book.   I like that their building is green.   I look forward to eating here often."}
{"text":"Clean, polite and had a great salsa bar.  AC could use a service call for the muggy smell.  For lunch the price was right for what was delivered off of the menu.  Considering the options for this part of town I would visit again.  They do accept AMEX.  I suggest trying the corn salsa.  Will it knock your socks off?  No.  But I would eat here again and there were no disappointments.  For the price you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful service. We enjoyed our meals. We had a chimichanga and pollo loco which were very tasty. A very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"We tried Guacamole's on 4/30/17 and we're so glad we did.  We were seated immediately and asked about drinks and told that we would get some chips shortly and to help ourselves to the salsa bar.  A basket of warm, fresh chips and white bean dip arrived with drinks.  The bean dip is very good.  From the salsa bar, we sampled the fresh pico de gallo, the creamy spicy jalapeno sauce and the traditional red salsa.  All were very flavorful.  We got a small guacamole to share before our entrées came and it was not made table-side, but was very good.  I think they only make the large size at your table.  We did not partake, but the table beside ours got the special $3 house margaritas - great deal!  There is an extensive menu.  For our entrées, we had the chicken and steak fajitas for two.  This came out very quickly; right after our guac.  It arrived hot and sizzling with delicious pieces of meat, onions, zucchini and bell peppers.  Accompanying the platter was a plate for each of us that had refried beans, Spanish rice, lettuce, sour cream and more guacamole.  We both mentioned that the rice was super delicious as we're used to flavorless, hard and sometimes crunchy rice at a Mexican place.  They had no problem bringing me corn and my husband flour tortillas; three each.  Our drinks and chip basket were kept full throughout the meal.  I had to keep my husband from scraping the skillet to get all the caramelized goodness before we both waddled out of here.   Overall, this was a well-priced, delicious and simple dinner.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's a large place with a buffet. We decided to order off the lunch menu. I had the chicken Santa Fe burrito. It had a roasted poblano chile, beans, cheese, chicken. Topped with sauce and cheese it was a solid 3* burrito. The salsa bar was good. Lots to choose from. I felt the green tomatillo salsa was on the verge of turning   My husband had the carnitas burrito and enjoyed it as well. It's was an okay experience not fantastic."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and waitress took drink order. She returned with drink and chips and bean dip. They have a salsa bar with a large variety of hot to mild. Requested a cheese dip, which came out quickly. Seating was comfortable and everything was clean. Menu was extensive and gave detailed descriptions of all appetizers and main course meals.    Service was outstanding. You never runout of chips, dips or drinks. Waitstaff  is on the job for sure. Manager came by twice to ensure we were being taken care of. We were a table of four and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had a chimichanga which came with rice, lettuce and sour cream. Chimichanga came with a brown sauce and was large and very tasty. Rice was only disappointment. It appeared to be a chicken rice and had no other spices. Needs to be spiced up with some peppers and other spices. Price not too bad, $15.00 including tip for each person.   Overall a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to A LOT of Mexican restaurants, and this was one of the worse. Food had no flavor. I've never seen rice the strange, pale yellow color they make it. Walked in and we were the only Hispanic people there... that should have been our sign to turn right back around. We won't be back"}
{"text":"When we arrived there were not many cars.  We were afraid that was a bad sign; but we went in anyway.  Very glad we stayed.  They start you off with bean dip for your chips, sounds odd but it was good.   They also after a salsa bar with a variety of free salsas. It was great.   The enchiladas I got were great!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service...The free bean dip and chips were really tasty. Generous portions for lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are in a hurry. Trying to eat here on a lunch break is impossible as the service and time it takes to receive your food is LONG! It's unfortunate because the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I had read some of the positive reviews on here and decided to give this place a try and I am so glad I did. Everything was delicious! The cheese dip, quesadillas, enchiladas, and fajitas were excellent! We had great service too! So don't let the horrendous outdoor green paint throw you off because the food inside is really good and doesn't hurt your wallet too bad either!"}
{"text":"I had read a lot of good reviews about Guacamole's on Yelp and a local Facebook page, so my friend and I decided we should try it one night for dinner.  We didn't have the same experience others are raving about.  The setting/decor/appearance did nothing for us.  The large room with old booths and flooring was not appealing.  We have eaten in a lot worse looking and liked it better so it's not that we were looking for a fancy restaurant.  The bean dip instead of typical salsa was unusual and we didn't care for it.  We were not told about the salsa bar until we saw it as leaving.  It was stuck over in a corner, again, not appetizing to me, don't know if that is where it's always located.  The food and drinks were good, but no better than anywhere else, in our opinion.  And I got what the waiter said was a favorite.  Drinks were good, as well.  Service was fast and pleasant.  I'm glad a Gastonia restaurant is doing well and others enjoy it, but I would not go back.  There are other Mexican restaurants in town I much prefer, they aren't much on decor either, but better than this."}
{"text":"Chicken burrito made my husband sick and I've never seen him not like Mexican food. Overall was not impressed."}
{"text":"Fajitas are excellent!  I typically opt for the Texas fajitas with chicken steak and shrimp.  The rice is well done not to greasy and flavorful.  The zucchini in the fajitas are delicious!! I my daughter and husband m tried the chimichanga and were not pleased so we just stick with the fajitas! We drive almost 30 minutes to eat here but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I wish I could do a half star. It's better then 3 but not quite 4 based on what I had. They offer a lunch buffet which I normally stay away from but since you don't see a Mexican buffet often how could you say no. Everything was got a pretty fresh. I did enjoy that several items were in corn tortillas and not flour. They also offer queso on the buffet.   For salsa fans they have a salsa buffet as well for your chips. That is free with any meal.  The buffet is as 8.99 which I didn't think was bad for a Sunday lunch considering the variety. I will say the quesadillas could be skipped. They were simply a flour tortilla with a little cheese...paper thin."}
{"text":"We've been to Guacamole's for dinner about half a dozen times since its opening and the food and service are both consistently good.  My husband likes it mild (Carolina Enchiladas - grilled shrimp/grilled chicken) and I like it hot (Spicy Beef - with grilled onions/peppers/zucchini).  We both enjoy the variety on the salsa bar and on the menu.  Many of the entrees are California style grilled, which is a nice option."}
{"text":"How this place is highly rated is a mystery. Disgusting. Arrived 1:15 pm on a Saturday.  The buffet was effectively all that was offered. The food was flavorless and sitting in hardened pools of melted \"cheese\". The ground beef tasted as though it was half sawdust. The salsa bar was a nice touch but virtually all options were thin runny consistency.  The refried beans tasted strange. The kids liked the \"quesadillas\". Tableside service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in the Carolinas so far and I'm from the land of Mexican food (AZ) awesome loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service . The portions sizes and great when ordering off the menu and the salsa bar is amazing . They started lunch buffet which is what we have be getting they have a good selection and everything was hot and fresh. The owner checked on us a couple times and maxed sure the buffet was fresh for us. This is our fav Mexican Resturant we have found around here. We moved here about a week ago but stated coming to the Resturant for about 2 months. Well worth it. Great job guys keep up the good work. We will be back"}
{"text":"Being vegan it!s hard to find a good meal where meat is dominant. But they were very accommodating and it was all delicious!! We will go back. The vegetarian burrito was especially good, it had mashed potatoes in it making it creamy and almost cheesy and bursting with flavor. Ollie was a great waiter as well!"}
{"text":"Good little place! It was tempting to turn into the BBQ place right next door, but I'm glad I didn't. The chicken was amazing and rice was cooked perfectly. Friendly staff too...the waiter made a solid recommendation Azzol de Pello. Great!  Not sure what the big hype over the \"salsa bar\" is...not that big a deal. I did like the beans they brought out the chips though. I could have made a meal out of that alone alone.  I will definitely back!"}
{"text":"I went here on cinco de mayo. Bad idea. It was an half hour to be seated. An hour to get food. It was cold. No one spoke English. Food orders went to the wrong table and person. Bar looked like family bar at home.  Horrible. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Good variety of Mexican dishes including mole, one of my favorites. Their mole on the chicken enchiladas was good but a little thin and needed some chipotle for a little heat. Place is known for hot sauces. The Inferno was good and the habanero was hot. Fajitas were seasoned well. Overall good food. Music was loud for a slow Monday. Prices were reasonable. We would go back."}
{"text":"The food here was very good! They seem a little short-staffed. We waited a long time for them to take our drink orders and food orders. The interior of this place needs some major design help to get a better atmosphere. The tables seem randomly placed. The exterior is so bright and cool looking- I feel like the interior should match it. The interior reminds me of a very old, dated buffet style hole-in-the-wall. It has a ton of potential, just needs some help on the inside and needs to get a bigger waiting staff. 4 stars for the food. Everyone I was with enjoyed what they ordered.  I also just moved here a year ago from Los Angeles and wouldn't really call this \"California style\" Mexican, but it is still very delicious. The food definitely gives Tequilas a run for its money."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant had 4.5 stars. It was just ok. Food is average, salsa did not meet expectations, but service was good."}
{"text":"The first time we went (many months ago) it was awesome, the buffet food was hot and plenty. The second time we went, it was much less food(not at the end of lunch) almost everything was scraps, and nothing was being refilled The third time we tried it it was still just okay.  There wasn't much of a variety (but unlimited queso!!) but still not something I would go out of the way for anymore."}
{"text":"Pretty good grub. Guacamole made tableside was delicious. Big portions, so make sure to have an appetite."}
{"text":"I was soooooo excited to go to this place.   The salsa bar thrilled me.  It was great.  Service was good.  Fast.  Here's the problem.  I ordered a burrito.  Shredded Beef.  I love good shredded beef.   This may have been good when it was fresh but when I got it it was grey.   And it smelled off.  And everything in the burrito was grey.  The beans were grey.  I'm on my 40s.  I wiped my glasses off.  The whole thing I split down the middle and spread it open to really look at this.  I had to hold up a spoon of some orange salsa next to it because I could not believe it.   I really thought my eyes went crazy.   No.  It was grey.   I was with 3 other people who got fajitas and they were happy.  I wished I had got that.  I did not complain because I didn't want to ruin it for them A lot of Mexican restaurants make a brisket and hold on to it and serve it when it's grey.  In Charlotte and area anyway.  I've been to hundreds of Mexican places.  There's several I got burned at around here.   Stick with ground beef stay away from shredded.  They don't go through enough of it to keep making it fresh so they keep grey rotting meat and serve it.   Nasty.  Not going back.  I wonder how old the salsas are now so I can't.  I hope they read this and decide to not make brisket anymore."}
{"text":"Best mexican in gastonia. We seem to eat here once a week. Great service,  large portions and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"So I've tried just about every Mexican food place in Gastonia and this is probably the best. Is that a compliment? Not really, because most of the Mexican food in Gastonia is pretty lousy.  Keep this in mind, I've lived most my life in South Texas and I don't expect the food in North Carolina to compare to what I'm used to.   Also keep in mind, the menu at Guacamole's is HUGE and I've only dined there a handful of times. Maybe I haven't ordered the right dish.  They have a trio of tacos (carne, pollo and carnitas) that I found petty good, but had them sub corn tortillas for flour.  Based of rave yelp reviews, I ordered a Chimichanga with shredded beef. While the thing was massive, 70% of the filling was the bean dip the restaurant serves as an free appetizer and the beef was pretty bland. The chimichanga was smothered with their queso, which tastes too much like cheap American cheese.   So, why would I go back..and I will likely go back. Guacamole's had a salad bar and even the mild salsa is pretty legit.  The green salsa is just as flavorful, but unfortunately not as spicy, as I'm accustomed to being served in Texas. And that bean dip I mentioned earlier isn't bad with pre-meal chips. I could see myself and a date making a meal out of the complimentary chips and dip and a few margaritas, which I hear are top notch but I've yet to try one..  I'll update this review when that happens, but it's not likely because I probably wouldn't bring a date here based on the atmosphere. It's like your strange aunt decided to throw a Cinco De Mayo party. One big dining room with some \"ethnic\" decor haphazardly thrown about.    They must do good business. Every time I've gone, there are lots of customers and other people ordering take out. Of you live in Gastonia, give it a chance.   I'm still looking for good Mexican in Gaston County. If you have any suggestions, let me know."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Their table side guacamole is amazing. Service is great, prices are reasonable, portions are generous.... They are the \"whole enchilada\"!"}
{"text":"Food - 4 Service- 5 Value - 5  This is a hidden gem that the locals here frequent.  The GPS will take you the wrong way, so be sure to stay on Union Rd and look for the steep driveway leading down to the green house.  The service was attentive but not overbearing.  The food was better than I expected and better even than some of the Tex-Mex places in the Dallas area where I live.  The guacamole was good and the chicken fajita quesadillas were also quite good and the portion was generous."}
{"text":"Great new addition to GASTONIA. The salsa bar was great. Table side guacamole was delicious-and huge!!! They have chorizo even if it's not on menu-just ask. The Sante Fe tacos were really good. Service was extremely attentive and prompt. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Best fajitas I've had in awhile! (And I'm from Texas) everything was full of flavor. Even the chips and bean dip.."}
{"text":"You won't have any trouble finding this place it's lime green on the outside. And while that get your attention so does the friendliness and the good food.  My wife and I enjoyed fajitas for two and had more than enough to bring home for at least one more meal.  The food was excellent there are many choices of salsa on the salsa bar, and the bean dip with chips is an interesting twist on pre-meal chips.  I am recommending all my friends here."}
{"text":"Out of town workin and have visited this place a handful of times. Every time except the last was absolutely wonderful, the last time awful!!!! Dry, under seasoned,burnt, and lack of quantity. Salsa bar was great the first couple of time but was lackin the last 1-2 times. Prob b the last time I eat here"}
{"text":"Went here close to closing, so sorry to the  staff, so we got the go to order of fajitas with all the meats.  It was awesome!   Chips and salsa were great, it has been a minute since I went, but I'm pretty sure there was a salsa bar. Who doesn't love a salsa bar?!?   They had complimentary bean dip that was so good!!   All in all I was impressed by the customer service, menu, and quality of food we received."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives. Salsa bar is awesome. The hot salsas actually have a little kick. The regular margarita very good. Actually a reason to go back. We tried the buffet and also pretty good for buffet which I've never seen in a Mexican place before. The downside was when we were seated and asked for a minute to look at the menu to see what we wanted to drink. He tried to rush us to order something right then because another group of people walked in behind us and he wanted to seat them. He looked upset with us and went to seat them, then came back to take our drink order. Had it not been our first time there we may have known what we wanted. May go back again for another margarita."}
{"text":"Food is good. (Tasty, fast) The people that work there are very nice. The only thing I dislike was my waiter, his nails were long and very very dirty, black dirty.  His hands didn't look clean enough to be handling food. He was very nice and attentive but his hands were not waiter hands. //Me gusto todo, la comida muy buena, rápido y gustosa. Lo único q no me gusto PARA NADA fueron las manos de mi mesero. Las uñas súper largas, todas negras por debajo (muy sucias) por lo que no es algo muy atractivo, en especial si va a estar trabajando con comida, llevándola y trayéndola.. El era muy atento pero, sus manos e higiene en las misma deja mucho que decir."}
{"text":"It was ok I'm not a fan of zucchini in my fajitas. The salsa bar is good. Service was great. Prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"How did this place get such high reviews?  After spending $20 for three enchiladas, I expected the food to be amazing.  Sadly, that was not the case.  The mystery meat covered in soggy tortillas and processed cheese dip were NOT enchiladas.  I've tasted better refried beans out of a can and the rice was a plastic, flavorless mess.  Mexican food is supposed to have FLAVOR.  This did not.  I was so disappointed that I ended up throwing the entire dish away after a few bites.  SO DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Came here on Cinco De Mayo. I know the Mexican places are limited in the area, but it seems like they had decent authentic food. The menu seems like it had a wide variety, which it does. But, I feel like the food was not \"delicious.\" The Margarita was absolutely not pleasurable on a holiday where you should drink them. Service was great and friendly, though."}
{"text":"Really good no frills reasonably priced Mexican food , place was empty when I got there and packed when I left I had chicken flautas and carnayesada   Both where very good . They also a have a Salsa bar with many good selections"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Food is amazing service is great!! Come on Gastonia  you must try.   You will love."}
{"text":"Wonderful food at great prices!  I have regularly recommended this to anyone looking to find a New Mexican joint.   I love that they have a salsa bar. Plenty of selections to choose from!  Also bean dip comes when you sit down (and it's tasty!)   I've not been disappointed by anything I've ordered thus far. (Tacos Santa Fe and the fajitas are my favorites)   And the staff is wonderful. Great service to be had here! You won't regret going."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious, I loved the grilled chicken in my spicy enchilada verde. The complimentary bean dip brought out when we sat down was really good and I always love a salsa bar. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best Spanish rice on the east coast!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I would give it about a 3.7. The salsa bar was pretty good and the Margarita's were on point. I got the spicy sante Fe tacos with chicken and they were delicious! I will definitely be going back. The only problem was for this place to be called guacamoles they don't give you much guacamole lol!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! My boyfriend and I took a chance while we were randomly in Gastonia and we were so pleasantly surprised! The salsa bar was great, our server was really nice, and the atmosphere was nice. It was toward closing time but there were still a few tables occupied. The server was attentive, the enchiladas mexicanas were delicious! I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. We went the first time today for Father's Day and it was really good! I especially liked the salsa bar and chips/bean dip! I have no complaints really with this restaurant. We did not have to wait long to be seated or have them take our orders. Also, the prices are really decent. We got 3 entrees, side of fries, and 3 drinks for less than $40.00! I would recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"This was an accidental find and man were we glad! Most delicious Mexican food hands down! Incredibly friendly service and reasonable prices. Would come here on purpose all the way from delaware"}
{"text":"A fresher version of other Mexican restaurants. I had he Chilli Carnidas and the wife had the Arroz Con Pollo. Both were very fresh and well done. Salsa bar offered great variety and quality."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Cali Mex thank god it isn't gross Tex-Mex that you get in most places.  I wouldn't say it is Mexico authentic but if you have been to Cali it is as close as it gets."}
{"text":"If this place ever opens back up please do not go! Even if they change the Name. In today's news in Gastonia, the owner was arrested for Having images of Child Porn of  children under 6 yrs old.Im sorry to Write this in a review, but this is too important to not let the Public know. You can look this information up online."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!!! Bean dip, salsa bar, table side guacamole, and the fact that they have shredded beef and horchata is a huge win! Have been here several times and the meals are fantastic! My new go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going out to guacamole's one night a couple weeks ago. My husband and I went craving mexican cuisine. I liked the different options on the salsa bar and the bean dip that comes with the complimentary chips. I got the Pollo Loco with peppers and onions instead of spinach and mushrooms and it was great! The rice and beans that came with it were fresh and the chicken was really good with the queso on top. My husband got plain Jane tacos but was pleased. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Tableside guacamole is delicious and the sauce bar is delicious. And the people are so nice. The price is very good and you get a lot of food. The owner adds a great personal touch. Thank you."}
{"text":"One of the most unique Mexican Places I've been in a while - a mix between the stands, trucks, and dives I frequent.   The chips are served with decried beans, and there's a salsa bar with several good options. I enjoyed the mango-habanero, cilantro, and a creamy sauce.  The regular salsa wasn't appealing.   I ordered a Cheese Chili Relleno. It was pan fried and fresh.  The buffet had just closed - it had a variety of items that the waitress said they rotated daily.  I'd like to come back for it."}
