{"text":"The food is absolutely great BT the service kindve sucked... Our waitress brought chicken and shrimp instead of steak and shrimp.when asked to bring the proper thing the waitress became noticably upset she stated she has to ask the manager and when she returned she said \"give it to me\" and snatched the plate tho lol at which time I no longer want nothing"}
{"text":"Just endured the worst eating experience we have had in years.  Guadalajara Especial was far from what was described.  Mostly a huge pile of stale lettuce floating atop of sea of greasy and essentially  tasteless soupy gray ground beef.  The tamale was  completely saltless but very peppery shredded meat of indeterminate species sitting atop a generous pile of ever so sticky and tasteless masa.   The taquitos were burned but running with liquid grease.  The salsa was really just canned tomato sauce without the usual seasonings including salt but with a dash of vinegar.

The only thing that could make this meal worse would have been table full of loud foul mouthed aging juvenile delinquents discussing with pride their DUI achievements along with petty crimes and best techniques for lying to law enforcement along with vivid graphic descriptions of the contents of diapers and the method of expressing canine anal glands.  These conversations were provided by several young men wearing blue Horne Heating and Air Conditioning tee shirts and tolerated with no attempt at control by management.

Just aweful."}
{"text":"Fast service, good food.  We've been coming here for years and have had easy going experiences nearly every time."}
{"text":"Excellent service, generous portions both food and drinks.  Nice to sit on the patio.  We are regulars.  A great value and a fun neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Highly recommend Los Arcos especially for families."}
{"text":"I appreciate having Mexican food at my fingertips. I'm not sure about the dine-in service but we frequently call orders in for pick up.  The pick up service is quick.  (About 15 min) You get a big bag of chips with salsa as well. I love their shredded chicken taco salad, which is what I order every time.   Overall it's good enough to satisfy a quick Mexican food craving.  It's not the best I ever had but it's decent for a Mexican food fix.  The salsa containers could be much bigger for to go orders."}
{"text":"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, but then I thought about our overall experience and two it is. 

The salsa (one red) served at the start of the meal was just ok but the chips were fresh and still warm. 
It's a positive two for the guacamole.THAT, I know for sure. Their guac is more of a creamy base with smashed tomatoes and bits (slivers) of onions,combined with some(read very little) avocado used just to make it seem green as guacamole should. 

The color green was very sad. I have had some great guac (shout out to Cantina and La Unica!) and it was a happy vibrant color of green. This sad muted green was on the other end of the rainbow. 

The fajitas were pretty good with nicely marinated chicken BUT they are served with no lime wedges.I used the left over lime from my Corona, which we (all four) thought they tasted flat out of the bottle? And were not very cold. The Chicken enchiladas were good. 

The server had to take a few moments in-between placing our order and asking questions about the menu etc. as if she was just learning English. She tripped up a few times but she was trying hard. 

After the big disappointment of a take out from one of my *former* favorites this was actually very good, which does not say much. 

There are is another Charlotte location and two in Gastonia but I won't be rushing to any of them. Most likely not giving this another shot either. 
If I am in the area I'll go next door to Nona's Sweets . OoPppS, scratch that.  I'll drive the 1/2 mile down the block to her new location and fill up on Italian nummies."}
{"text":"Momma always taught me to say something nice - so let me start by saying the renovations on the new location at the Gastonia Mall are very nice.   Sadly, that's where the good review ends.  The service was horrible.  Just waiting and waiting and waiting to be seated - at 5:30 on a weeknight mind you - was terrible. There was no hostess and apparently no system of knowing what tables were open. We were a simple party if two.  Three different people started to seat us only to walk a few feet then decide (somehow) that there was no where to go.  Meanwhile up to six servers stood around the front yesterday charting away.  I finally had to ask if we could sit a fine one he clearly available tables in the bar only to be told they were reserved.  Later I had to ask to be seated on the patio - also clearly open but never suggested. 

Apparently the patio is no man's land because we then waited and waited. First for drink order then for drinks to come - not what we ordered.  Once the food order was taken I will say the food came quickly.  

The food was mediocre and over priced. Then we asked for the check.  And waited and waited ......."}
{"text":"The location has changed but the quality hasn't budged a fraction of an inch.  I think my favorite dish will always be a guadalajara special with multiple Negra Modelo's.  Really good post band practice food."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is the best part!  The food is pretty good and the beers are cold.  The service, not so much."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim. Was visiting the area. Service was good and attentive. We had 2 different Quesadila. Food was fresh and good. Guacamole was fresh with just a bit of spice. Good experience and good portion size."}
{"text":"The new Los Arcos infront of Gaston Mall was great. Same owner new location. Food and service was amazing."}
{"text":"My husband suggested this place .... we were to meet for dinner,  I made it there 1st and was very disappointed in cleanliness, this place is dirty, from the nasty carpets to the seats. After sitting there for about 5min, I got up and walked out, called my husband to meet at another restaurant in the area. I will never return."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened a week ago so we thought we'd try it out, as we love Mexican food.  The decor is nice, but I would rate the food as sub-par.  First, this is primarily a buffet restaurant but is not advertised as such.  Not liking buffets, we ordered off the regular dinner menu.

Also being vegetarian we ordered one of the vegetarian variety dishes that came with a cheese enchilada, cheese burrito, cheese quesadilla, and taco.  I should have known something wasn't right when our food came out in less than two minutes of ordering it.  Everything tasted the same....extremely bland and borderline awful....very tasteless.  The cheese in our burrito wasn't even melted.  

I'm glad our bill was only $20 or I would have considered not paying.  Needless to say, I would not recommend this place to anyone.....but if you would like decent Mexican food, you may want to stop by the Taco Bell that literally is in the same parking lot as this place.  We left Los Arcos and drove three miles down the road to a superbly awesome Mexican restaurant, Don Pedros, which I give five stars."}
{"text":"The buffet is reasonably priced, the food however...mediocre at best and it really is a gamble on the service. I've had a few servers that were top notch and a few that' ve never heard the phrase \"customer service\".

 Honestly, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I recently dined at this los arcos and in fact I'm currently here now. It was so deplorable that it called for a comment asap. It put such a bad taste in my mouth for mexican food that I will not care for it for a while. That's saying a great deal for I because I eat at about 6-8 different area mexican restaurants and this one is by far the worst one I have ever been to. All of the proportions were a disgrace, there was hardly any meat on all of the dishes, and the manager would not face us when we presented the server with the problem. Sadly, the server informed us that the manager was sorry instead of the manager themself, and on top of that, they only took off a 20 percent discount from our total bill. I dined here with my girlfriend and her two children. We all mutually agreed that this food was disgusting, luke warm, and poor proportions. We will not be back and advice everyone else to stay away as well. My girlfriend and I work in the food industry everyday and the two of us hate ourselves for not going to the taco bell that sets directly behind the restaurant instead. Absolute bummer!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. But the waitress was HORRIBLE she wouldn't bring out any extra chips or refill on drinks unless we asked. Then she just stops serving us! We had about 4 servers throughout our dinner. We definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, the service is ok. However, the vegeterian options are very limited and the food is extremely salty."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my husband, daughter, and niece.  When we arrived we were promptly seated.  It then took approximately 10 minutes for someone to drop off salsa, and another 5-8 for another server to greet us to get our drinks. After we ordered drinks, it took another 10 minutes to place our order even though our menus were gathered and folded on the table (sure sign to anyone that we were ready to order). I ordered for the girls, 2 quesadilla kids meals, and a taco salad for myself.  My husband  ordered apetizers for us (chicken wings, and guacamolel) and Carne asada as a main course. We specified that the kids food should come first, even before the apetizers.  Well... the kids meals came first, then came my order, then my husbands order...lastly came you guessed it the apetizers. The kids hated their quesadilla said it tasted funny (mozzarella cheese?) Needless to say the other entrees an apetizers followed suite.  It was so ... bland.  I am pregnant and hospital food tastes better than this. Got the check to find out that the kids meal does not include a drink even though I asked the server if I could get orange juice with their meal (he agreed). 2 bucks per drink for some imitation non refillable oj had me at my wits end.  I just told my husband deduct it from his tip. He laughed and said we should have went to chick FIL a.  If you ever get the feeling of going to this restaurant dont.  Take my husbands advice...just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This review is actually for the new location on new hope road outside the mall.  Worst mexican food me and my husband have ever had. Tasteless. Overcooked! Runny beans!  Sloppy appearance.  Poor quality of food!"}
{"text":"Good Food. My favorite part is the salsa. Most Mexican places have chunks of fresh herbs in their salsa, however; I am not a fan of that type of salsa. It is not too tasty. Los Arcos makes gallons of fresh sauce daily and it is puréed to perfection. The new location is awesome at Eastridge Mall. I am a weekly customer and have been for the several years. The owners are very nice too!"}
{"text":"I truly miss the old smaller Los Arcos. Seems with the bigger upgraded building they had to make cuts somewhere....seems like it was the food. I haven't returned often since the last few times were just disappointing. I used to go to the old Los Arcos several times a month. Now, I avoid it and go to Tequilas."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Sunday night. The service was fast and our meal came quickly. The portions were large and the carne asada was very good but the arroz con pollo wasn't the best dish and the salsa could have used some added flavor."}
{"text":"I had the fish taco for lunch and it is totally tasteless. Where in Mexico do they eat fish tacos with thousand island dressing? This is a low budget resturant that offers an all you can eat buffet for lunch which I did not try but seems to attract the locals. If you care about the taste of food then I would recommend to stay away."}
{"text":"Let me first say that who ever gave it 1 star doesn't know Mexican food. I guess they have never been outside of Charlotte Before!

The food was priced very well. It was cheep and tasted very good. We started off the night with a Margarita which was good. Got Guacamole that was tasty as well. You cant go wrong with a 2.50 guac dish. As for as our main dishes it was great!! I think this place is very good. 

I have yet to be there for the Lunch or Lunch Buffet, the dinner was great. The plates were huge and tasted wonderful. If you think that \"South of the Border\" is good Mexican then A) you don't know good Food B) this place will blow that crap out of the water!!

In the area you can not beat this place for food and for the price. it is a must go to place here in this part of Charlotte. If you think you want to have a good night with some friends and your thinking Bull and Barrister, I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty spacious and typical Mexican cuisine. I didn't really care for much, seems more lack of seasoning than anything. Service was fair. Only 2 other tables and the server couldn't keep up."}
{"text":"Los Arcos has been one of my favorite restaurants since I was a kid! 

This place is definitely not fancy or high end. Unassuming and filled with hand painted murals and comfy booths. 

The menu is rather large and has a vegetarian section (woohoo, gosh knows Kannapolis is in dire need of more veggie friendly spots). The staff is always really nice and your order comes out super fast! I've barely had time to make a dent in my free chips and salsa and out comes my entree on a pipin' hot plate.

My favorites: spinach burrito and the queso."}
{"text":"Woooow, I will try not to be ugly here but I have to be honest. I have never tasted more Americanized Mexican food in my life. No Spice and very very little flavor. Service without a smile and an overall poor experience. Do NOT waste your time here, drive down 85 anywhere. I have to say something nice in my review so I will say.... the Music was great! Good luck Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Stupid waitress with a manly laugh took ages to serve us even though we were the only people there.  Plenty of time to laugh it up with her boyfriend at the bar though."}
{"text":"hands down the worst mexican food. low grade dog food. weak margaritas. would recommend skipping a meal before eating here."}
{"text":"This isn't a place I'd go if you want a truly good Mexican meal.  The chips are greasy and while the salsa has good flavor but more like sauce literally as there are no onions, tomato chunks, nor cilantro in it.  My top shelf margarita was anything but.  I couldn't tell it even had tequila in it let alone Top SHELF BRAND JOSE CUERVO!  It was zip to me so they took it away and remade it.  Not sure if someone was being funny but when i got my new drink it was smaller and quite strong but a bad flavor,  not a quality tequila.
My food was good for the most part although very simple and small portion for the cost.  As I was eating I came across a small hair and that just made me sick.  I only told my server about not liking the drink BEFORE I even came across the hair.  I just paid and left as I figured it would do no good to tell them as nothing would change and I ate here passing through on my way to another state.  I truly suggest you eat elsewhere.  The server didn't seem very happy to be their either.  We always appreciate a smiling face and touch of enthusiasm at least.  Our server had neither."}
{"text":"Recently opened in the old max & erma's, the outdoor renovations are beautiful. The inside is weird. Sterile, overly bright, carpeted floors and odd decor for being a brand new place. 

Both experiences here have been dull. Chips are too thick and salsa couldn't be blander. They did accommodate my special request for onion and pepper chimichangas. 2 came on the plate, and it was a ridiculously large amount of food. However, the chimi had been fried too long and tasted of stale oil. Combine that with the cheese dip on top, the meal was too much. Too heavy and no flavor. 

I recently tried the weekend buffet (11-3). There is almost nothing vegetarian on the buffet, but for $7.50 one can't possibly complain."}
{"text":"Great food, I was nervous going in to eat not being able to speak Spanish but most of the employees speak English well and the buffet for lunch is sooooo amazing and delicious, also very inexpensive, I would eat lunch here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"I found Los Arcos!  :)  They are about to open up behind the Taco Bell on the corner of JW Clay and WT Harris (where Max and Erma's used to be).  They are still working on the building, but so glad they are re-opening!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many time through the years. Because it's close, easy and not terrible food. But Sunday was more disrespect than I can take. We ordered our drinks and food, no issue. After waiting 40 mins,which is crazy for this place, we get 2 of our 4 orders. Wait another 10 minutes we get the third order. She finally ask me my order as she is dropping this entree off. Telling me it was coming she has to go pick it up. Ok. Another 5 minutes passes my family is finished with their plates, she picks their plates up and apologize again. I tell her it's alright, just put it in a box I'll eat it at home we are ready for the check. She returns with the bill still no food and we notice they charged us full price for their mistake. I ask her if some compensation can be made, she replies \"no, is you want the food you have to pay for it\" to that I said \"no worries.\" Great customer service guy! I'll drive a few extra minutes if it means I can actually have the food I order. Will not be back to see you anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ugh. Just, ugh...

Take out: bottom of all tortillas wet. Tacos fell apart trying to pick them up. Quesadillas were a thick soup. Really?  I am not a cook, and I could do way better!"}
{"text":"This local standby is always a favorite and I introduced a good friend and new yelper to the K-town go to for Mexican...Los Arcos.  It is unassuming and located in a transformed steakhouse but offers a great meal for a great price and with great service...what more could you ask for!?!

The cheese queso (with jalapenos please) is SO good and I get it every time we go and couple it with the hot salsa and chips...oh MY!...I chose the chicken fajitas tonight and they were great and he had the beef fajita quesadilla and it looked great too!

Service was awesome, attentive and helpful and always SO friendly!  I have never had a dish here that I didn't like - check it out if you're around town...It's a great choice!"}
{"text":"Yeah. Having the manager call me a \"fat old lady\" in Spanish and then proceed to make fun of me while I was checking out pretty much ensured that I will not ever return. So diners, beware. 
And it sucks too, because the food is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant around here by far. The queso dip with jalapeños is definitely out of this world.  The servers are always nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Not a good value you better eat a lot of food for your money. Slow service :( They did not have enough help. They did not make me and my group fell welcome. I will vote against ever going back."}
{"text":"Service here is extremely poor. You have to wait 5 minutes for refills on your drinks and they will try to bring you only one thing of chips and 1 salsa for four people and avoid filling it back up before your food gets to your table."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican Restraunt in Kannapolis everything is delicious! I love there newly remodeled look it's wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite of the Mexican restaurants around here. Pollo Loco is my favorite and it's even awesome as leftovers! Drinks are fair priced. My waiter was awesome too. Middle aged man on a Friday night, sorry i couldn't have got his name to give him better props :("}
{"text":"I like going here for dinner & taking the night off of cooking.  They do good Tex-mex style plates.  The restaurant over over-lit  (too bright and uninviting) so we sit at the bar.  Service has been okay,  sometimes you gotta just hollar when ya need something,  and that's just another perk of eating at the bar."}
{"text":"They have very good food   The service is a little slow if they are busy. They are nice to the customers"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this chain for years! I fluent this location more than the others.  The food is fantastic. The salsa is perfect. To the yelpers who rate this place low I say try some of the places all around the states! This place always has good service, great food with huge portions. Their RICE and CHIPS  are some of the best I have experienced! !!! When visiting this restaurant,  they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"RELOCATED. Remembered it being better at their old location, to be honest I was quite disappointed this last time. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have a great authentic Mexican buffet. Use to frequent this place a lot when I lived in Stanley. Now I only visit when I'm in town since moving to Mooresville. The new building they built from scratch is beautiful. The food is just amazing as it was in the small strip mall. Check them out if you haven't already. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Quite pleased. We had been going often a couple years ago but the food kept getting worse as did the service.  By things have changed. The wait staff was very attentive without being annoying and the food was both ample and very good. We eat out often and when we find the right combination we select one or two local Restarunt's to frequent. I think we are back here if things stay the same for our Mexican food cr"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I frequent this Location multiple times a month. 
Decided to go on the bartender advice and get a margarita which I hated. 
Drank maybe 4 or 5 sips and asked the bartender for a beer as I didn't care for the margarita she made me. She dumped it and got me the beer. 
Received my Bill and was told because I drank from it I would have to pay for it. 
Asked her how I'm supposed to know if I don't like something of I don't drink from it? Bartender told me, that's just what the manager said. So I asked to speak with her. 
Before she even arrived at my table you could tell she wasn't even willing to hear what I had to say. As soon as I stated what had happened I was told by the so called \"owner/manager\" That they hate customers like me. 
And I asked her what she meant by customers like me. She stated ones who try to get free.  
I told her I used to work in restaurant and I used to bartend myself and before I could even finish what I was saying to this \"owner/manager\" she said I don't care what you do. She make you the best margarita. 
I asked her how she (owner/manager) could possibly know that as she didn't make it herself. 
Needless to say she continue to tell me that I should have told the bartender I didn't like it before I even tried it if I didn't want to pay for it. 
And again I continuously tried to tell this lady it's not that I didn't want to pay for it-- I clearly wanted to pay for it as I had ordered it because it is what I wanted-- but I did not like it and it wasn't made \"the best\" 
And it definitely was not the best margarita I've ever had it was way too sour and way way too salty. 
I suggest that you take your business elsewhere. 
They clearly have no idea what customer service is or even cares about customer service. 
Don't waste your money on folk who don't even care if their regular customers are happy. They sure as shit won't care if your once in a while pop in is happy."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had in the Kannapolis/Concord area. The special dinner is incredible and you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"Buffet is amazing! I also come for dinner quite often and the service is pretty good! Chips, cheese, and salsa are delicious. Not overpriced for the good amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Our service and food were great. Everyone on the staff tried to make it an experience and not just a dinner! Fajitas and carne asada tacos were delectable!"}
{"text":"They TOTALLY remodeled this place inside and out....it looks GREAT. ..best of all the burritos here are awesome."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Concord/Kannapolis. Everything is delicious. Been coming to Los Arcos for close to 20 years now and it never disappoints. I moved an hour away and had not had it in 5 years but moved back to Kannapolis recently and went back to Los Arcos yesterday. It was exactly what I remember!! Los Arcos will be back in the rotation immediately!!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Charlotte this location was a  frequent stop for me. The food is fresh and delicious and the portions are extremely generous. The service is sketchy sometimes but overall this is a great place to get some quality Mexican food. Check them out!"}
{"text":"The food is always delish! The service usually pretty good but I always seem to run out of water when we're here. Even with today being cinco de mayo they have done a good job at being timely. They also offered the lunch buffet at dinner for the holiday!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good. I love the build your own taco buffet. They have just about every topping you would want and a lot of different meats! Even fried fish.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Came here because of the good reviews but service was slow and food was just okay. You'll find much better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ive came twice after church on Sundays and enjoy the buffet for the price. The food is seasoned well and I enjoy being able to make different items from the budget like burritos, taco salads, and fajitas. Their shrimp fajitas was good, I sad that when I went back it wasn't offered on the buffet. I will def be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I feel bad, this will be my first \"one star\" rating for any business. I so wanted to like this place since it is the closest Mexican restaurant to my house. I have been here about three times before I started Yelping and each time the food quality seemed to get worse.... 

First, this is your typical strip mall chain Mexi joint. They come to your table quick with water and chips (that was the only bright spot). The salsa came and it tasted and looked like watered down ketchup with a fleck or two of pepper seeds in it to give it the appearance of salsa - must have came from a large drum of pre-over-processed salsa rejects. My idea of salsa is fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, etc where I can see and know what I am eating. THIS CRAP WAS GROSS! 

My food arrived - I think we all have ordered the \"3 enchiladas\" plate from any of our Mexican favorites. Mine was covered, well avalanched with ice burg lettuce, cold runny sour cream and unmelted cheese. I wanted to ask for a small shovel to find my 3 enchiladas covered up on the bottom. Anyway, i got to them and the chicken was ice cold and gross, one bite - done with that one....I thought, hmmm, melted cheese enchilada....wrong - cut into that and all the cheese was still unmelted - WTF! The beef enchilada was ok and it warranted two bites, but had no flavor. 

Trying to keep this short - but overall, food SUCKED and I will not go back even on someone else's dime! 

see my pics from this trip...."}
{"text":"So, i went today for the lunch buffet and unfortunately, i've got to take away a star. The beef just wasn't good today. Tasted almost uncooked, but still in a grease tub. Also the rice was pretty blah too. The rest of the stuff was good enough for a cheap Mexican buffet (beans, cheese, lettuce, shells). 
Overall, i still think it's worth 6 bucks.  
 

The service was top notch, even for a buffet, the server was like a mind reader. Constantly topping my drink off when low. i thought to myself, i need a napkin and sure as shit, there he was with napkins...before i asked."}
{"text":"My father and I came to this restaurant after being extremely disappointed by the lack of service we received next door at Venice Pizzeria Italian Restaurant.

At Los Arcos Mexican Restaurant, we were greeted by our server within 30 seconds of being seated, had chips and salsa within another 30 seconds, and were given our drinks another 30 seconds after that.  We were extremely satisfied with the prompt, attentive service we received by the team at Los Arcos.  Our meal was delivered quickly and as ordered.  Everything tasted great; and, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Los Arcos.  If we are ever in the area again, we would definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is sooo good! My favorite Mexican restaurant. It's like that special hole in the wall authentic food you always hope you find."}
{"text":"This place is great! We stopped in on the way home from a long day at the whitewater center looking for a good margarita and some tasty food. This place didn't disappoint! Everyone who works there is so welcoming and the food was awesome! Make sure to get a margarita too! ;)"}
{"text":"Tons of food. Especially mexican food. This place is close to my parent's house and well, this is probably the place to go to when we're craving for some mexican food. Because it's 1. Extremely close, for those eat and sleep situations and 2. The food is good (and the beer is pretty cheap), and lastly 3. The portions on the plates are absolutely huge and plentiful.

I don't understand why they have a low rating on the restaurant, as this is the place I would go to for a quick mexican food fix. I mean I have to say this isn't the place to get a nice gourmet mexican food. It's a place where you go get down and dirty with some mexican food and if you choose to drink, they have a bar and you can lounge. 

Overall, I think this place is wonderful. I get my fix for mexican food and well, I come out full. I'll definitely come back to this place when I'm craving for it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Ordered 2 enchiladas over the phone to pick up. Got there handed my card...after I signed I thought about it and realized my order was two enchilada dinners. I asked her to refund it and charge me for what I ordered. She rung it up again for the cost. I ended up paying like 30 dollars for 9 dollars worth of food!!!! Then she was like give me back the food!!! What!?!? I live 5 minutes away and drive to Miguel's. Better food better service."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. The staff is always friendly and the service is top notch.

The food is always piping hot, served quickly and delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great, waitress was super pleasant and on her shit. Salsa is straight fire too. Has kind of a habanero bite to it that was so amazing that I literally came in my pants. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place was worth the visit. The food was good, the prices were great and the staff were attentive. All in all worth trying out if your in the area."}
{"text":"The wife & I eat here just about every Sunday night. Great Margaritas. She especially likes the Enchiladas de Cameron. (Shrimp Enchiladas). I like that as well. The burrito fundido is probably my favorite. The wait staff speaks very good English."}
{"text":"Went there for Cinco de mayo and the wait for food was over and the hour air conditioning was broke it was very hot. My wife's food came out without tortillas or the sides to build the fajitas. Had to send the chicken back to warm again by the time the rest came out. Overall very bad experience probably not ever visiting again."}
{"text":"I have yet to be impressed with the food here, but will keep trying. It just seems like a bland plate that neither warms the heart nor makes an impact.

Honestly, I probably don't know what I'm talking about because I know a lot of folks who like it here. Right now? It's not for me."}
{"text":"this is one of the best Mexican places  the food was so good that we had to go back the next day for lunch. the people were very nice the food was hot . we will go back again and again"}
{"text":"The food wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't good. If you can't get salsa right at a Mexican restaurant then you have failed."}
{"text":"The food is always good, hot, and fast. Even during peak times we have never had to wait long. The prices are reasonable and the buffet has a wide variety of food. The servers are always very nice. This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Gastonia. For a cheaper meal I do suggest going for lunch. Even the buffet is cheaper."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. I had been skeptical of trying because I have had bad experiences at the location in Gastonia. I'm so glad we ate here though. The cheese dip was amazing and the shrimp quesadillas were the best I've ever had. This will be our new mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service is always awful 
The food is sub par but they slop everything on a plate and don't even have the love for there food to at least plate it so it looks appetizing 
They probably only stay in business because there is no other Latin food anywhere around the area and the native Carolinians probably think this food is good but since I've lived in San Diego next to the border of Mexico I know what real Mexican food is and this is not also living in south Florida I know what real Latin food is and this place doesn't hold a candle to any kind of Spanish food I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"This is your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. It's decent food, decent prices, but nothing extraordinary. It's a bit small and a little stuffy feeling. I'm not so much a fan of feeling like I'm in the way of the servers trying to get food to the tables or other patrons getting around, but it's inevitable in such a tiny space. It kind of detracts from your meal.

But I will say, the Arroz con Pollo is OUTSTANDING. Probably the only reason I really go back to this place at all."}
{"text":"Very greasy every time I go. Last time I went I ordered the chicken soup which was actually quite good however that's probably the only thing on the menu I can tolerate without feeling ill afterwards. Very Disappointing."}
{"text":"I live this place. Great food, great service. Lunch time buffet is fast and cheap. Try the Guadalajara Special with a BIG beer. My kids love the variety on the kids menu and they always seem to be able to handle special orders without any problems."}
{"text":"I'm from CA too, and really looking for decent mexican food.  This really wasn't it, at all.  Everything seemed overly drippy, not flavorful, and generally just meh.  Service was decent, but I won't be back.  Tamales were REALLY bad, so if you do go, at least don't get those.  Just sayin'"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem at this location. The buffet is pretty good. The manager has always been very friendly. 

I grew up in Cali and know what real a 5 star Mexican restaurant is, so on that note- 
3 stars for the food
5 stars for the service"}
{"text":"I am working in Gastonia from out of town and have come here twice now. Both times we've had the pleasure of javier being our waiter. He has been super friendly and helpful and quick. Food is good!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. They've stepped up their game and they deserve their ranking to go up!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and had the lunch buffet and was thoroughly satisfied. Just enough options. The wings were great! My friend and I were seated promptly. I don't remember the servers name but she was very polite and attentive. I will return!"}
{"text":"Buffet...but awesome!  Great pollo loco, very spicy!  Looks can be deciving and this is worth the look."}
{"text":"Basically a good place, best one in Gastonia"}
{"text":"Since I'm from California, I'm always on the look-out for a good authentic Mexican restaurant. I believe I found what I am looking for! It was recommended by a couple of my friends to try this place out since I live in the Concord area. It kind of reminded me of a 'hole-in-the-wall' place where it's not a corporate America type place *cough* On The Border *cough*. 

We started out with the chips and salsa and of course side of queso dips. The queso is fantastic! You can opt out the jalapeño peppers and just go with the cheese. What impressed me the most is when we were on our 2nd queso dip boat and received our food, the waitress asked if we wanted the cheese reheated. I've never had a waitress do that, so big points there!

The food was great! The menu was pretty extensive and easy to work through. I got the #22. 1 burrito, 1 enchilada, and 1 tamale. I haven't had a good tamale in a long time and this one was perfect. It wasn't just all corn meal and the meat inside was fresh and warm instead of either still frozen because it wasn't cooked long enough, or just above cool. The burrito could have used a little more meat in it, but it was still very good. I particularly liked the fact that my meal wasn't small portions of what I ordered and a TON of spanish rice. It was all balanced evenly. Like most Mexican restaurants, watch out for the plates, they're hot.

The service was prompt and friendly. Glasses were never empty, and the food was right on time.

Sadly, I didn't drink but I was looking at their drink specials and I will have to come back and try them out. They have $2.99 margaritas that look really yummy, and of course the other standard liquor drink specials looked like a good deal as well. 

The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because I think it might have had something to do with me getting sick later on. Even though I ended up getting sick, I will still go back."}
{"text":"The Los Arcos Mexican Restaurant by the Gaston Mall----hmmm....beautiful building...We loved our waiter....but that is about it...food was a runny mess on the plate and tasted the same. We were also seated by the kitchen when there plenty of other seats available. I hope with time the food will match the building....great location. We will try again and see if it has improved."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Building is plenty big for any size group. Parking lot is gigantic, bring your boat with you if you want! This is the same Mexican joint that was in the shopping strip mall just down the road."}
{"text":"So...do they assume you want the buffet? We were given no menus. Communication could have used a lil work. Food was alright. We were only charged for one adult buffet when it was two of us so I threw in another star. I'm sad this isn't very far from where we live but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"While in the - general - vicinity, looking for someplace else to eat, and trying to avoid going to Nona's, we decided to give a try to Los Arcos.  How can you not, with those nicely-appointed windows?  It looks like they built it just for you!

Unfortunately, the service isn't terribly good, and that's when no one is there.  I can't even imagine what it's like when they get busy.  Perhaps they don't.

As to the food - the portions are decently sized, and the ingredients seem to be reasonably fresh, but put them all together and they seem to be utterly average.  I really don't know how that could happen.  I think that we were just spoiled by Don Juan's in Mint Hill, and those wonderfully fresh chips..."}
{"text":"the food was not done the help kept getting everything wrong they were trying to over bill me n my family the floors were dirty food was under the tables ! i will never go back to eat their again"}
{"text":"Service and price leave much to be desired. As a Mexican restaurant adventurer, this is probably one of the most expensive ones out there in the entire Charlotte metro area. The cool pineapple plate was pretty good though, albiet not exactly fresh."}
{"text":"Tastes okay going down then sits like a cinder block.  You can get better Mex from the chains but some people swear by this place.  Just doesn't have the spice of other Mexican food."}
{"text":"Service was \"bizarre\". Place half empty and they kept insisting that we sit in back by kitchen when we wanted to sit in bar. Food was just ok - not a fan of buffet style  and in between lunch and dinner so can't really comment. The place did have good ambience so may try again as we come to Gastonia quite a bit....as long as we can sit in the bar area and we usually need quick service when we do."}
{"text":"My family lives in the area, and I grew up there, so I have been eating here since I was very young (and at the time they were located in what is now the Italian restaurant across the parking lot).

Throughout the years (at least 18 ago), I have seen staff come and go, the menu change and change again, and several redecorations, but the original manager from my childhood still makes appearances every now and again, a true testament to a good restaurant chain (they have a couple of locations).

This is not authentic Mexican cuisine in any sense of the word (at least not Distrito Federal), and it is not Tex-Mex, but it is perfectly acceptable and delicious.

Service is always quick and decent to excellent. They definitely know and take care of their regulars, so that is a major positive. 

As my family has visited frequently since their original days, I do not hold the restaurant against it (since my adopted family is Caucasian and English speaking, I was adopted) but the staff does not seem to like to speak Spanish, even though I speak it fluently. Since I live in Brazil (Portuguese speaking I know) and often work throughout Latin America, particularly Argentina, I speak Spanish fluently, although with a non-traditional accent. The staff often seems offended and off-put when I speak to them in Spanish.

That said, the food is excellent and very decently priced. I have seen some improvements to some dishes, and some declines to other during the years, but overall it is still quite delicious. My favourites are Burrito Jalisco en Pollo, Chimichanga al Carbon en Carne Asada, y Camarone a la Diabla (muy picante).

The only downside is that unfortunately if you like super spicy food, you can only receive it (even if requesting \"muy picante\") if you are visiting without \"gringo\" patrons. I have ordered the same dishes on multiple occasions both with my family (ended up mild) and without (deliciously painful)."}
{"text":"I came into make a to go order as I entered I noticed a customer sending their food back,as I stood there the waiter that took the food back to the kitchen stood in the back and without washing his hands picked out all the onions from this customers plate a hole plate later the waiter hands this customers plate to the cook he puts hot cheese over the mess of food and sends it back to the waiter to give back to the customer thankfully the customer noticed something wasn't right and sent it back at that point the waiter put the plate of food in the trash and made a new one,I walked over and made sure the customer knew what happend. I pray everyone stays away from this place and it gets shut down. What happento this customer should never happen."}
{"text":"Well... The water was good...
Very bland food. Weird tasting chicken. And honestly margaritas that taste like pure tasteless syrup. Very odd..."}
{"text":"big fan of the lunch buffet.  Although it tends to be the same things most of the time there are 4 bins that rotate what is offered.  the kid always enjoys cheese quesadilla and tater tots.  i enjoy making my soft tacos with the spicey steak."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican food.  Pretty good.  All our wishes were accommodated.  The waitress was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"10.66 for lunch buffet with water is a rip off. It's the same as their weekday buffet they are just gouging you on a Sunday"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Great people! Great food! Best fajitas in town! Wife and kids love the cheese dip. Been coming here for almost 15 years."}
{"text":"Pretty great food, the consistency is an issue. We always do takeout because service is spotty but when we do takeout the portions are just never the same---somedays you get a ridiculous amount of food, others not so much---to the point of I'm not even sure what the serving size is actually supposed to be. Last time we ordered I did no peppers and my boyfriend did no mushrooms. Well he got a bunch of mushrooms and no peppers, and I got no mushrooms, but at least they didn't put peppers in my food. They even had the boxes marked correctly so I'm not sure what happened. Some guy names Cruze is pretty rude so we haven't been back since. We used to go three-four times a month but that guy was super rude.  The food deserves five stars when it's right, but the inconsistency and rude staff doesn't earn the place a 5 Star review."}
{"text":"While deciding what to make for dinner, decided to go here for my first time. Wow! I got the steak super burrito, and it was super delicious.  Food tasted clean and fresh. Top of the burrito had a white, thick, cheese sauce glazed on it, which made the meal even better. I loved this place!  Great quality food, good customer service, and not to mention really cool fluorescent lighting."}
{"text":"I'm forced to give this place a star rating but I can't even give this restaurant any stars in my book!It seems they have s hard time to understand what a Bean and cheese burrito is and the real understanding of what Mexican food truly is!  What they serve is Tex-Mex not Mexican Food like they advertise themselves as!! I went in tonight to buy a bean and cheese burrito and it costed me almost $5 for something that really should of only costed $1.50 at most!  And on top of it it took them almost 15 minutes to make this gross mess!  I will definitely not be referring anyone to eat here!  I can make Mexican food 200% better than anyone here!"}
{"text":"We are new to this area of town and were checking out the restaurant options. We ran across Los Arcos and decided to give it a try. We didn't do the buffet because they rarely offer the things we like. So glad we gave this place a chance! The service was great, food was great, very fresh! The restaurant was very clean, and no screaming children lol...that's one of my pet peeves about eating out, although I know that isn't the restaurant's fault. We will definitely be back! Oh, I forgot to mention the delicious Margarita, also :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Ameri-Mex last night with a co-worker and I was not disappointed by the food or service at Los Arcos.  I ordered a grande margarita and it ended up being the second biggest margarita I've ever drank.  It had to be at least 20 oz!  It was delicious too!

The fresh, warm tortilla chips were good and the salsa had a little kick, which I really liked.

For dinner, I ordered the mahi tacos, which were good.  The sauce on them was really good.  I'd order them again.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great choice for Mexican and good service! Drinks were on point.. Carne Asada had a nice flavor"}
{"text":"I am always leery when an authentic Mexican restaurant uses ground beef!!??
for those of you who think this is Authentic Mexican food.. I feel so sorry for your taste buds."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food with super large portions. Most entrees are large enough to share. The servers are really attentive and the kitchen always accommodates special request. I just wish the interior was more appealing. It isn't dirty, just unkept."}
{"text":"Great place!  Took a gamble and we were very happy with the results.  Low key, game was on and the food was fresh and perfect.  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"45 minutes before our order was finally taken, waiter acted stressed which shows they need more help, small portions and over priced. Had to remind him about our drinks after he only brought one. Then the waiter only brings out one plate of food and by the time I got mine my husband was already done with his food. And they never did bring all of my food. So pissed off, will NEVER eat there again!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in just for a beer, chips, and salsa.  Also had the cheese and bean dip, can't complain of course its hard to mess those few things up right?"}
{"text":"the lunch buffet is the only value from this restaurant..the service is horrible if you go at night or not during lunch buffet times depending on which server you get. there are two servers that are nice and attentive and wonderful...the rest..eh...... food is good on buffet, always something different....great salad bar and i LOVE their pico di gallo?? i dont think i spelled that right so sorry!!! no judgement!! lol"}
{"text":"Have always loved this place, the Buffett is always good but went there yesterday and was charged $5.25 for my one and a half year olds plate. He ate a few bites of rice. The service and food are always on point but that's just a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"This isn't Mexican food. Worst crap I ever tasted. Everything tastes canned and frozen. It's obvious the area lacks legitimate choices for good fresh food. Just keep in mind that just because it's a low price and all you can eat doesn't mean it's not arsenic laden food. Here's a tip. A can of tomato sauce does not constitute salsa. And shredded iceberg with chunks of tomato is not pico de gallo. Seems like people's taste buds have been burned off by all the chemicals they're ingesting. Oh and for f's sake, how in the world can a Mexican place not serve black beans?? Mexico is crying."}
{"text":"It had probably been 3+ years since I had been here. I was pleasantly surprised at how great everything was. They had new booths, larger portions, and different options. In Kannapolis, people either go to Los Arcos, El Amigo, or Casa Grande. I will definitely add Los Arcos into our rotation because everything we had was great. I had Chipotle Chicken with Rice and Beans. It was a delicious spin on the typical Arroz con Pollo that you find at other restaurants.

Also, if you are looking for the typical Arroz con pollo, you'd want to order the pollo con crema here. The arroz con pollo here is different than at most places."}
{"text":"This place could be so much better.
The food quality just isn't there.

I had the lunch buffett, it was just OK.
A bit surprised to find fried okra on a mexican buffett.
Must be 'southern mex'."}
