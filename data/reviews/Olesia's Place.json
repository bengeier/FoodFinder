{"text":"After driving past this new restaurant many times and glancing at its unique structure with curiosity, we finally stopped in, and are so glad we did. Set in a converted spa showroom that might look like a greenhouse from the exterior, Olesia's Place, located on Royalton Road in North Royalton, provides a comfortable, upscale dining environment and simply delicious American-Ukrainian cuisine. They feature a wide selection of dishes, all made from scratch and prepared according to the traditional recipes of their heritage.  We stopped in just to check out their happy hour, but ended up staying for dinner as well. The Happy Hour is fantastic. Nicely priced apps, specialty drinks, and house wine pours along with domestic and Ukrainian beers. Whether sitting at the bar or in the dining area, you can enjoy the view of multiple fireplaces which provide a cozy atmosphere.  To start, we enjoyed the happy hour red wine pour (very nice) and he had the Chicken Shish Kabob Skewer appetizer, served with house-made sauce, couscous and salad. The portion could have been a light dinner entree, and is actually offered in larger portion on the dinner menu. The chicken was grilled, well seasoned and very good. But the stand out was the amazing couscous. Simple, flavorful, light and fluffy.  For dinner, we started with something we had never tasted before, Borscht. A traditional Ukrainian soup made with beets, root vegetables and finished with sour cream. Not a fan of beets at all, it was a real surprise for me. It was so savory, robust, and complex that we are still talking about it. We definitely will order a full bowl next visit, having just ordered a cup this time. Next up, Mushroom Pierogies, filled with mushrooms, cheese, spices and served with onions and sour cream. Homemade and just delicious. He had the Pan Seared Salmon with sautéed spinach, seasonal vegetable, apricot glaze with an added side that just had to be tasted - Stuffed Cabbage. It came stuffed with beef, rice, onions, spices, and served with tomato or mushroom sauce. He opted for the mushroom sauce, which was an excellent choice.  All in all, Olesia's Place provides a beautiful, warm, welcoming interior perfect for a cold evening. They have a great happy hour, and a dining menu that deserves full exploration. It also seems to have a nice patio for when the weather gets nice. Enjoy. And check out their website too. Nicely done and shows you just what to expect."}
{"text":"Where should I begin?   This evening while trying to figure out what to eat I stumbled upon Olesia's.  I recently moved to the area and have been looking for a great local restaurant.  I found it.   To be clear my time in the restaurant was limited but as I waited for my takeout I noticed a very welcoming environment that was lively with a busy bar and live music.  As I waited I was struck by an extremely pleasant smell coming from the kitchen and I the treason was clear as I watched a few entrées on there way to the dining room.     Very please with what I observed I brought back my soup and dinners home.  It was delicious.  Chicken paprikash was awesome, the pierogis may have been the best I have ever had and the stuffed cabbage was food network worthy.    I highly recommend Olesia's to anyone in the Cleveland area. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Place is fabulous. Great mixed drinks and the food is delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone thinking of trying it."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! The pierogis were amazing!! This will be a staple in my family!!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night for a double date. We walked in and immediately noticed how nice the inside was. The hostess asked if we had reservation; we didn't but were seated anyway. There was a jazz band playing that evening. The staff was very friendly. We got the short rib perogies as an appetizer. They were delicious. I had the stroganoff. The portion was huge and it was very good. My boyfriend got the salmon and said it was delicious. After dinner, our waitress came around giving everyone cake; apparently it was the owner's birthday. It was such a sweet gesture. An excellent evening. I'd definitely go back when I need some comfort food."}
{"text":"Terrible service terrible food. The owner would not even come out to talk to a customer. Do not go here plenty of other much nicer restaurants in the area.  Stay away !"}
{"text":"Service was great, clean restaurant and the food was fantastic. We had the beef stroganoff, schnitzel special, mushroom perogies and Nepolean cake. I recommend them all.  Decent portions (we took home half of each of our entrees) and the prices were very reasonable. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Bravo!    We are on a cross-country driving trip, and from Yelp reviews...and the menu itself...decided 6 weeks ago that when we came through Ohio, we would eat at Olesia's. We are thrilled that we did.  The borscht is the best we have ever had in a restaurant. The potato pierogies were thick and jammed with potatoes and cheese. I'm a pierogie connoisseur, and this was seriously good. My husband had the stuffed cabbage with two sauces and thick garlic-laced mashed potatoes. It was outstanding. They were huge!   We took a slice of chocolate caramel peanut butter pie to go since we needed time to digest all the wonderfulness! It was the best dessert I've ever had, hands down. No question.  I said to my husband, \"What's wrong with us????? WHY didn't we get 5 of these to go????\"  I wish I could go back, but we are on the road again and need to go forward!  RUN to Olesia's and treat yourself to the best food around!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. We go here for  all our special occasions! The lobster bisque is amazing! The staff is great! The private room is very nice! We were sat there for our anniversary and it was very romantic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a last minute decision and we are so glad we did! The crab bisque had a wonderful flavor and tons of crab meat. I ordered the stuffed pork tenderloin, which is not a usual choice I would make. This is probably one of the best meals Ive had, the flavor and presentation was outstanding.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been here several time including a private party and all of my experiences have been great. I LOVE THE FOOD! It's like my grandmother is somewhere in their kitchen making this stuff. Pierogies with the pulled beef on top are to die for. The borscht soup is actually very good...everyone always says their mom's is better (and it still is) but this comes pretty close to my mom's. Very unique atmosphere, they have a nice small private gazebo room and in the summer the patio is nice and relaxing. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Totally average \"Ukrainian Food\". It ll be cool if u will have a Ukrainian chief to make the food better guys."}
{"text":"We ordered potato, cheese, and sauerkraut pierogies with a side of beet soup. The pierogies were great but the beet soup was a little salty for my taste as I never add salt to anything I make at home. A little bit of sour cream in the soup balanced the flavors and made it perfect! They have takeout which is great if you just want to relax at home with some traditional Ukrainian food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The atmosphere was relaxed. Prices were reasonable. I tried the blueberry mojito and highly recommend it. I'm so happy we found this little gem!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, from the traditional homemade Ukrainian food, to the comfortable venue. The main dining area is underneath a glass atrium which gives great ambience. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves heaping plates of delicious food for a reasonable price. My personal favorite is between two different entreé's, the beef stroganoff and the stuffed cabbage dinner. All the food is made from scratch and you can taste it in the flavor! Be consciousness if you plan on dining there on the weekends, they can fill up their dining room fast due to the demand of customers, so make reservations. Olesia's Place also offers quality live music, anything from Frank Sinatra to modern country. It is a very unique and diverse experience, accommodated with a friendly staff. Lastly, don't plan on ordering an entreé unless you're absolutely starving or you will have bought your lunch for the next day as well! I hope everyone enjoys this place as much as I have!"}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food. Killer pierogis! Also had the blackened salmon taco special - cooked perfectly. The service was fast and attentive. Great alternative to all the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef stroganoff. The gravy was good, the meat was tender and plentiful. However, the noodles were mushy and very overboiled. They could have added more noodles to the dish also since noodles are dirt cheap..."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight, and even though they were super busy, we had a great time. I would recommend a reservation on a weekend night. I had the beet salad, lobster + crab bisque, and the mushroom risotto. My spouse had one of the daily specials, which was a scallop salad. We ended up sharing everything because it was so good. The meal was very reasonable in price and we will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Don't be scared off the the outside looks of this place.  The food is great, the severs are nice and the place is clean.  They have some good specials and entertainment on the weekends.  The seating can be a little tight but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Went there with a Friday night reservation. Placed right in front of the band.  No other seating offered although there were plenty of empty tables. Opted for bar seating because the food is usually very good and we made a last minute reservation.  Seated at bar, bartender said she would be with us, that never happened.  She left the bar, started delivering drinks to tables, never acknowledged us again. Enough is enough we left. What is sad because the food good, but the poor service makes it not worth it. Ate there 6 months ago, food was good service was slow but unlike today they were busy."}
{"text":"I cannot review the food. We were seated in the bar because we didn't have a reservation. The bartender was our server. I was facing her and she was not very busy. She was not able to take orders from more than one table at a time. She was next to us three times in ten minutes and never acknowledged us. After ten minutes we were aggravated and left. Everything may be great there, but I would turn and leave if your are asked to eat in the bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a very large menu selection. We had a very positive experience and thoroughly enjoyed the borscht and the platter which included 3 perogies, a cabbage roll, kraut and kielbasa. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"GREAT stuffed cabbage and perogies.  Nice casual dining in greenhouse style room.  We eat here frequently...and always get the stuffed cabbage YUM"}
{"text":"Soup sampler was an awesome price to get a perfect sized taste of the three soups. Garlic butter was savory on the bread. Pierogis were piled high with short rib and the onion straws worked added a nice crunch. Seafood pasta was plentiful and creamalicious. Schnitzel was the shiz!"}
{"text":"The menu wasn't to my liking.  The burger I had was good, yet over priced.  French fries were soggy and oily.  I was not offered a water refill until we got the check.   Burger, salad and small bowl paprikash.  $26."}
{"text":"I'm taking away one star after my return visit with older children.  I still think the food is really good, and would love to go back without the kids.  But they do not have a children's menu, or a changing table, or even kid-friendly cups.  My kids still found plenty to eat, and they do have some items on the menu in smaller portions, but it's not a good value to pay $5.50 for your kid to eat 3 pierogies when you could get them a meal with a main dish, side, and drink at most other similarly-priced restaurants."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the area's hidden gems. Don't be fooled by the lawn and tractor equipment behind the restaurant--this is a very good restaurant with an inviting ambiance, friendly staff and delicious food. My husband and I have visited a few times the last couple of years and were happy to learn after welcoming our first child that it's also kid friendly. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome the service is okay. I visited the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon with two friends and the hostess was also our server who was also our bartender. Talk about wearing a lot of hats! Our service was superb until other people started showing up. Then the service went from great to not good at all. To have 1 person doing all three things to me is a bit much (personal opinion).   The food however was delicious!! My friends and I ordered a few different things and everything tasted wonderful. We ordered a side of potato pierogis (comes with 3), one of the specials which was the Short Rib pierogis, the Mushroom Risotto and the Potato Pancakes. The one thing that I was let down about was the waitress forgot to mention that the Potato Pancakes take extra time to make. Others were getting our food before us and then she decided to tell us. So please take note if you decide to order these. The potato pierogis here are in my list of top 5 best pierogis in Cleveland.   Because of the food I will give them another try but I sure hope they have more help on hand to ensure good service for my next visit.  Note: They are currently remodeling their patio so it is currently closed."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. I had been here once before for drinks and vowed to come back for the food. An early Friday dinner was on the agenda for today.   We were seated promptly in the atrium. The ONLY complaint we have is the sun. As it was setting in the west, my wife seated across from me had it right in here eyes. She wore my sunglasses for most of the dinner. If she swayed back and forth, I would have thought I was dinning with Stevie Wonder.   We didn't order appetizers or salads, but they did bring out a basket of warm French bread. Tastes like they made it on site.   For dinner, I had the scallops and substituted perogies for mashed potatoes. Three stalks of asparagus finished off the plate. The scallops were blackened and served with a side of something for dipping that was outstanding. The perogies were boiled and sautéed with onions. Not fries crispy like I'm used to, but heavenly nonetheless. There were only 3 scallops and 4 or 5 perogies. I thought it wouldn't fill me up, but it did.   My wife had the stuffed cabbage and mashed potatoes. When she didn't have food in her mouth she was raving about how good it was.   We will be back again, in a few weeks for grandpas 80th birthday."}
{"text":"Best chicken paprikash I've ever had! Great ambiance and fantastic service. I had the beef tip perogies which were great and my husband had the stuffed cabbage which was also good. The French 75 cocktail ( my favorite! ) I ordered was also great.  Great upscale comfort food establishment and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Second time here...as good as the first!  Went to celebrate Grandma's birthday and has a really nice meal.  Grandma chose the salmon with dill sauce, hearty and perfectly grilled served with a side of mushroom risotto.  My wife's short rib pierogis were plump and full of meat, served with onion straws.  I started with the lobster and crab bisque which was full of seafood and not overly sweet.  The sampler platter I ordered for my meal had an array of options including potato pierogis, grilled kielbasa with sauerkraut and a stuffed cabbage with mushroom sauce (still prefer a red meat sauce but glad I tried it).  All of our dishes were tasty and filling, perfect for a cold winter day.  I hear they've got a good weekday burger special that is also on my radar screen.  Looking forward to my next time back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great Borscht and Beets-related food. Short rib crepes and decent pierogies.  Kramer said, \"The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble.\"  This place proves how wrong he was.  The lamb kebobs and Tzatziki sauce was a well done as well. Definitely try the place."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm impressed. The place is cozy(a bit small) but not crowded or cluttered. We came in for a quick bite before our son's play down the street. This Ukrainian restaurant did not disappoint. The wife had an order of sauerkraut balls and I had chicken paprikash stew. Both were AMAZING!! There was live music setting up as we were leaving. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Every time. We cannot wait to come again to try a new plate. The menu is fabulous!"}
{"text":"This was a find!  Food was tasty and beautifully presented.  Service friendly and excellent, but not intrusive.  Prices reasonable for the quality.  New favorite on the west side!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Wonderful food. So flavorful. I tried the Borsch soup, roasted beet salad and the Pork chop with mash potato and coleslaw. All I can say is delicious. Totally five stars. The ambiance is romantic, candle light and jazz band. AWESOME!  Great service too.  We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Danielle's wanted to go here for a while, so we agreed to check it out on Friday.  After reading some reviews I didn't know what to expect.  I'm happy to say that we were not subject to any sort of rudeness or whatever.  Danielle ordered soup and a salad (chicken paprikash stew and a Greek salad). She thought the stew tasted like \"Chef Boyardee\" but she liked the salad very much.  I got The Platter (pierogis, sour kraut, kielbasa and a cabbage roll). I thought the pierogis were delicious. I liked the kielbasa and thought the cabbage roll was good as well. I was a little let down by the sour kraut, as i thought it wasn't very sour at all.  All said, it was a good dinner and one I'd like to have again."}
{"text":"After having driven by this place forever, decided to give it a try.  Made reservations on line and when we arrived, our reservation was not on the books.  The hostess said I should have called.  That sort of defeats the purpose of doing a reservation on line.  So not starting out well.  Fortunately we were seated right away.  Ordered borscht which was good.  No complaints.  Dinner choices were schnitzel and the platter.  Our server was simply average.  Call me old fashioned but I have issues with my server wearing a nose ring or a lip ring.  That's a deal breaker for me.  Food was plentiful but in my opinion, was just okay and I left a little disappointed.  Place was busy so I guess other people think differently than I do.  All in all, not a bad experience and not an overly good one.  I'd give it a 7/10"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife tonight.  Had read good things about this place and our favorite eastern European place, Pierzok, had closed down last year so we were hankering for some stuffed cabbage and pierogies.  The happy hour menu looked pretty decent, so we rushed to get there at the right time to qualify for it.  When we got there, the restaurant was virtually empty- one or two other tables had guests at it.  The hostess looked at us and said, \"Do you have a reservation?\"  Now, I didn't make a reservation- didn't realize that these seats were hot seats in town.  I said \"No\" and so she asked us if were were here for \"dinner\" and I said \"yes\".  When I sat down, I looked at the menu and to my surprise there was no Happy Hour menu.  I asked the waitress about it and she said that she would check and after checking, she said that the Happy Hour menu was only available at the bar.  I looked at my wife and we decided it wasn't worth the trouble to switch seats- but really?  Only at the bar?  In an empty restaurant?  Anyways, we ordered the borscht soup (very bright, tasty and different- we'd never had this before and would order it again), Chicken Paprikash (meh, definitely very meh.  We had to add salt and pepper and I can't remember the last time we had to add salt and pepper to a restaurant dish) and the Ukrainian Favorites (two stuff cabbages and 3 pierogies).  The stuffed cabbages were OK- they also needed salt.  Pierzok's rolls were better.  Pierogies were good- but were run of the mill pierogies.  Bread was a really nice crusty loaf with a delicious herbed butter.  They didn't bring refills or offer to.    Service was decent- our waitress did come back to check on us, but she wasn't very friendly, at least compared to the way she was with the ethnic Ukrainians who were speaking their native language.    Will I come back?  I'm not sure- I did like the borscht soup and the bread.  Next time I'll come back, sit at the bar and get some happy hour entrees- they did look interesting to me."}
{"text":"Ok menu is quite a bit different then the standard menu. Been there 3 times now food has been excellent all three times. Weeknights kind of quiet which is what I like in a restaurant. Drinks were excellent somebody knows what they're doing. Price wise excellent you can't go wrong here. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"We sat down and had a cocktail on the table within 7 min! The server was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Try the soup flight, good sampler. Pierogis are clearly home made, abundantly filled with a nice thin, tender dough. Great value and taste for your money. Definitely will return soon!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the outstanding short rib perogies and the adorable sun room.  As others have stated the service was incredibly slow. This was due to having only one server for the entire restaurant for lunch on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Say at the bar on a busy Thursday night (there was a rehearsal dinner) and had a great experience. For being busy with making drinks, the bartender was very attentive. The soup sampler was excellent, as every soup had rich flavor. I had the stuffed cabbage and pierogi special with mushroom sauce. The mushroom sauce was very delicious, and I was even more surprised since I've always had red sauce accompany stuffed cabbage. I will be back very soon to try more menu items! Oh and I can't forget, the butter they serve with the bread was stellar as well."}
{"text":"Great food but very slow service.... Also the girls working there seem to not have much experience in the restaurant business, if they can't remember to bring you a drink till after you're done with your meal, I mean maybe you shouldn't be a server...."}
{"text":"Hands down...Fantastic!  Food, Service & Selection are unparalleled!  Eastern European cuisine at it's best!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. Found my new favorite dish, lemon/dill salmon with mushroom risotto and asparagus- yummy! They also have entertainment on Friday nights. Logan Wells was there last time. Ronny was there tonight. He's awesome! Anyone that has a range that covers Cher, Journey, Bee Gees, Eagles, and Frank Sinatra has got some kind of talent. Nice evening, and yes, the service is usually slow. The food is worth it."}
{"text":"Very beautiful place, with nice outdoor seating. Friendly and quick services. Now, I've only been here once but this is not the Ukrainian food your Ukrainian mother makes. Flavorless, perhaps meant to feed very intoxicated Ukrainians? Idk. I was sober and disappointed. Not too expansive though. I had the holopski (stuffed cabbage) and perogies. Both were very bland. Stick to Mr. T's Frozen perogies. Fix this ASAP bc all the Americans think Ukrainian food sucks. It's embarrassing."}
{"text":"My mom and I were coming back from the mall while I was in town visiting for Christmas and we decided to stop at Olesia's because my mom knows my love for pierogies. Olesia's did not disappoint! We got the chicken paprikash first then split the pierogies and both were delicious. The restaurant wasn't too busy because we came at an odd time between lunch and dinner, so the service was obviously great. Very friendly. We also got bread with our food, which is a plus. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful, we sat right by the warm fireplace. It looked like they had an outdoor patio for summertime too. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town and have already recommended it to friends!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. A great mix of dishes that had me wanting to return to try more before I even had my first bite. The available cocktail list was slightly short, but did include some good mixes and beers. The service was the lowest point of the visit with the hostess greeting us in a somewhat rude manner. Our waitress, however, looked over us closely and made sure everything was great. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was ok, but not great. There was a laser moving around the room that often distracted from conversation. On the other hand, there was live music which served to liven up the room. I would recommend this to someone looking for a fun casual dinner with some good food. If you are looking for a more calm and quiet setting, this may not be the number 1 choice."}
{"text":"Really the bartender might be the worst I've ever encountered. The restaurant isn't  that big and thus is the third or fourth time this bartender totally dropped the ball . She runs around like a chicken with her head cut off , and accomplishes little. Ok so I get it the owner wants her to capitalize on tips at tables and the bar ...BUT she isn't CAPABLE. Seriously the food is decent , but when service is this bad who cares ."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  What an amazing find.  Food was amazing. We had to try several things because everything looked so good and it was all amazing. The borscht was spectacular - 57 ingredients!!  The roasted beet salad was delicious as well. Then we tried for our dinners the platter, which had pierogis, saurkraut, kielbasa and stuffed cabbage and the short rib pierogis. Everything was amazing. The service couldn't have been better.  Even the bread comes with a delicious garlic butter.  Come hungry!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday early evening and was not overly impressed. Had the chicken kabobs dish which was plentiful but not much flavor and the platter which consisted of a good stuffed cabbage in tomato sauce, pierogies that seemed overly doughy, and three SLICES of kielbasa and kraut. Also had the chicken paprikash soup that had a strong herby taste and the borscht which was loaded with onions similar to French onion soup. Overall the food was fair and the service was good in a decent setting, but if you are seeking outstanding European comfort food with generous and reasonably priced portions in a vibrant and memorable setting, you can't beat the cafeteria-style University Inn of Tremont."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined at Olesia's Place to celebrate her birthday. We were both surprised and delighted by the warm atmosphere and vast menu.   To start, we received complimentary warm bread with herb butter. Then, we split the delicious roasted veggie hummus with pita. We both ordered the spinach and strawberry salad and it was super fresh and yummy. We both agreed that there were many more menu items we wanted to try so we will definitely be back.  The restaurant was a bit loud but our waitress was kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome Dinner.  We met some friends here last night for dinner, my wife and I traveled in from Chicago and heard great things about this place.  We walked in and were pleasantly surprised,  the place was very nice inside and was bustling with a lot of frequent diners.   We had a party of eight and every one of us had a great meal, perfect service, and really enjoyed the evening.   The food quality here was a 10 out of 10, and I would compare it to some high quality restaurants in Chicago.   We will be back here next time we come back to the Cleveland area.   From the homemade soups, Borscht and Lobster Bisque to the Beef Stroganoff, Lambchops, Scallops, Stuffed Cabbage rolls all of us had excellent prepared meals and excellent service.   Stop in to try this place, you will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Keep Driving! My mother and I must have driven by at least 100 times until I suggested we try it. She said it was probably terrible. She was right. Charming interior, but it was downhill from there. Hostess/server had the most sloppy appearance. They were out of the crepes I came for. Went with the stroganoff. It was made with a few shreds of beef and was so rich it made me sick. Potato pancakes were served burned black. Received replacements, but they were tasteless. Borscht had so many extra ingredients, I could not find the beets. My mother had the stuffed cabbage. That was okay. I advise you to keep driving east on SR82 to Macedonia and spend your money at Sides to Go instead. See my review of that."}
{"text":"Best lobster bisque soup ever, meaty not cheaply made.  Great crab cakes, pierogies and the beet/goat cheese salad.  Those are my must have items."}
{"text":"I will come here again, soon. We had the deviled eggs (average), chicken paprikash (very good), pierogis and short rib (excellent), and beer battered cod with pierogi (also excellent). We called before we left to see what the wait would be and there wasn't one, but they allowed us to put our names in, which was really nice. We were seated right away when we arrived. My only surprise was the live music: it was Saturday night and the performer was pretty good but Olesia's is not a huge place so it was extremely loud (partially because of two particularly raucous tables right up front by the musician). We had to wait for lulls in the music or shout to talk to each other. I could tell some other groups were not happy with the noise level that night. If that's not your thing, try coming here on a weeknight-that's my plan! Love the food and service."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. My fiancé and I were very delighted to find a nice eastern European joint in the middle of nowhere ohio. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Olesia's is a Ukrainian restaurant that is out of the way for me but I have to say the drive is worth it. I stopped in for an early Happy Hour (I think it's 2:30-6pm) and sat at the bar. It was pretty quiet inside and I wasn't noticed at first, but I ended up with pleasant service. I started off with the soup flight $6 which I highly recommend. I am a fan of tastings so it was perfect to be able to try three of their homemade soups: red borscht, chicken paprikash, and lobster bisque. I had never had borscht before but it was pretty good! A unique soup that had this beet and tomato taste to it that just works. The other soups were thick and tasty with maybe a little more salt that I like but I don't put salt in anything so it always stands out to me. I also want to note that you get bread as soon as you sit down. Crusty outside and soft inside with garlic butter.   Next up I tried the beet salad which is a great steal on the happy hour menu for only $5! I'd say it's a pretty decent sized salad, in fact I must have been full from the soup because I could only take a couple bites of the salad before I asked for a to-go box. Not a fan of the chunk of creamy goat cheese that I had to break up myself, but would still order this again.   I also got The Platter $16 to-go. It consists of a large cabbage roll with either red or mushroom sauce, three cheese and potato pierogies with onions and sour cream, and sauerkraut with your choice of sausage or kielbasa. I was told the meat is made by a local Ukrainian woman. As with everything here it's all homemade. That cabbage roll was one of the best I have every had, one bite and I could not stop eating it! The pierogies you could tell had cheese in them and the shell reminded me almost of the consistency that gnocchi has, just a little firmer if that makes sense. I've never been a big kielbasa/kraut fan so if I could I would trade that in for veggies.   All in all a good experience. I was disappointed that they were out of several things, but it seems like this place is a local favorite and they don't have enough staff to keep up with demand. Olesia has been here six years now and I hope she continues to keep making her homemade dishes. Hopefully next time they have cheburek and that napoleon dessert!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice inside (a tad quiet for my enjoyment, but still nice) I came here for lunch with my sis, mom and 4 month old daughter (after the lunch rush, about 1) We were seated promptly and had decent service. The food was good, although I felt a tad over priced. The chicken paprikash was ok and so were the pierogis, although there was confusion on cooking methods. At home when we make them, we \"fry\" them in a pan with butter, so initially we ordered them fried. But then we saw the other option was sautéed, so we clarified with the owner to be sure she knew we did not want them deep fried. She said she'd make sure, but they still came out deep fried, and we felt bad... My mom got the stuffed cabbage and thought it was very good. I tried to order the chicken crepes, but they were out... so the waitress suggested short rib crepes. They were ok, I guess I'm not a big short rib fan. I might visit again for happy hour since it's so close to me, but might not...the price point is reaching for what it is."}
{"text":"I just love this place!! The ambiance, decor etc. the food is always spot on. I've been here probably over 30 times and it's always consistent. Never had a problem with any aspect of the restaurant. My faves are the beet salad and the stuffed cabbage. I hope this place is around a long time."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 good friends had a wonderful meal and time last night!  The menu has something for everyone.  We enjoyed tasty deviled eggs, as well as potato pancakes for our appetizers.  Both were excellent.  Add a wonderful pitcher or two of sangria and everyone was happy.  Our main meals were perfectly prepared.  The pork schnitzel was outstanding with sides of creamy homemade mashed potatoes, a red cabbage slaw, and lettuce.  Be sure to come with a hearty appetite because the portions are generous.  The ambiance was jovial... a good crowd of happy diners.   If you're looking for something different and delicious don't hesitate to try this 'hidden' gem.  The service was excellent.  Be sure to have a reservation for the weekend because this place is busy, always a good sign of good food and great value!  Olesia personally came around to check on the guests, which was such a nice touch.   Enjoy this wonderful place."}
{"text":"NE Ohio has a wealth of ethnic restaurants, and this is one of them.  I was looking for a restaurant that featured Ukranian food and was directed here.  It is an unassuming suburban location.  The dining room looks formal, but the chairs could use some new upholstery.  Service is spotty - it took a while for me to be greeted by the hostess, but no problems after that.  The dining room is usually full, even on weeknights.  I recommend making reservations.  The menu is moderate sized, with ethnic and some American (hamburger) entrees.  There is a daily special.  The \"soup flight\" was one of the more unique items I have seen on a menu.  The borscht was amazing, however.  I had the stuffed cabbage, which comes with either tomato or mushroom sauce - I had one of each.  There are pierogies and other ethnic items as well.  Portions are generous.  Food was well prepared, but mine was a bit cool.  There is a nice beer and wine selection, with imported items.  There are some nice ethnic desserts on the menu, but I could not force myself to try them.  Overall, if you are interested in an evening featuring ethnic comfort food and good service, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Being a Pittsburgh native now living in MD I always look for Eastern European food when traveling.   This was a fortunate find.  The borscht was delicious,  potato pancakes were cooked to perfection, stuffed cabbage spot on, stroganoff and perogie dishes superb.  Really glad we found this!"}
{"text":"First time eating Ukrainian food and what a great find for eating at this amazing restaurant. The food is only exceeded by the unbelievably great service. I highly recommend trying it out. You will not be disappointed! Smachnoho!"}
{"text":"The inside is very nice and has a large brick fireplace. Nice bar area. Menu is really different and has many options. Food was really good and my fiancée and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice but when we stopped by it seemed to only attract an older crowd. The lobster bisque was AMAZING! My wife bough the Smoked salmon with potato cakes and i got the Olesia burger.  The burger was great but salmon with potato cakes were good but the potato cakes seemed to be missing something. I would def eat here again if we ever pass through this area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went there a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered 2 stuffed cabbage and 3 pierogi. The stuffed cabbage was huge, so I was only able to eat one and the pierogi was very good, the best I've had at a restaurant. This place is legit, my grandmother is Ukrainian and this was the kind of food I grew up on so I'm very picky and this was very close to my grandmothers cooking! Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I liked the place and here is why: it's tasty, picturesque and affordable. I am just so sick of all the places where they charge you $20+ per entrée and deliver absolutely nothing magical on the plate. Olesia's place is the way Americans  usually imagine Russia: cute Russian waitresses with perfect English, generous kebabs, crepes, and dramatic view out of the window. None of this is Russian, not even close. But no one in North Royalton would have been able to stomach herring, fish eggs, tiny portions or bad attitude. So even though a lot of traditional dishes are missing, whatever they have is really good. Portions are beyond generous and service is impeccable. Na zdorov'e!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to entertain business clients and it was nothing less than superb. There were 8 of us and nobody complained.  Food arrived when it should and all were smiles.  In particular were the short rib pierogies.  - WOW - they were spectacular.   I grew up and live in Pittsburgh so a pyrohi or pierogie or however you want to spell it, Olesia's the real deal.  Half my family is polish and the other half italian.  Tonight was a celebration of eastern Europe food and it was great."}
{"text":"Food and service were very good but if you go on an evening with live music outside don't get a seat inside. Every time the wait staff open the door to go outside, blasting music comes into the restaurant for about 5 seconds until the door closes. It's not that the music is bad but the quiet atmosphere to blasting music back to quiet is not pleasant. Over and over again. It would be better if they just had the music piped into the restaurant the whole time.   The soup flight is a great idea for a starter and they pull it off very well. The borscht is my favorite."}
{"text":"Ambience:  Arrived at 12 noon on Friday, we were the only table in the restaurant. Half of the restaurant walls are glass walls which made it very bright and cheerful even on a snowy day. The interior highly contrasts with the entrance and parking lot, which formed our first impression: big old John Deere farm trucks! At first we thought we got the wrong address.  One of my dining buddies, from Serbia, confirms our food was legit. These would be dishes they always eat at their family gathering. We had  - borscht soup: very good, the menu boasts it's made of 57 ingredients; I could only visually identify 4 and taste tomato in it. I have no problem ordering it again.  - pierogi sampler: 6 big pierogies of potato, mushroom and sauerkraut fillings. Flavorful.They are not deep fried. They are first boiled then sautéed. Go very well with fried thin onion rings on top. They are very filling. I had to take half home.  - Ukrainian favorites: 2 stuffed cabbage rolls, 2 pierogies, slices of kielbasa. I particularly liked the flavor of the cabbage skin. The filling, like other yelpers said, had noticeable amount of rice. About kielbasa- If you look at my photo, I bet you'll want to call it \"sausages\". The server insisted it is NOT sausages. It is new to my Serbian friend, so I looked it up, and indeed it is Polish/Ukrainian sausage.   - grilled chicken kebab pita: my friend said it was good.  Dessert: They made apple pie, cream brûlée and Napoleon cake in house.  - Napoleon cake: not overly sweet, made of soft filo dough, slightly sour, perhaps from the sour cream filling between the layers. Better than the one we got from Yeleseyevsky's pastry counter.  - Location: it's in the middle of nowhere. I mean it's not surrounded by forests, but there are no point of interests that would bring me here. If i lived in Strongsville or Parma, I'd add Olesia's to my rotation. But would I drive 40 minutes to come here specifically? Not so sure, unless this is the only place to get non-fried pierogies."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for date night. Clean, friendly and delicious. A tad pricey but the portions were generous! Drinks were great as well!"}
{"text":"Outstanding potato pancakes! The portion sizes here are huge and everything was ridiculously delicious!!  The service was a bit slower than we would have liked. The atmosphere is great! Very very cute place!"}
{"text":"Tried the \"Ukranian Snacks\" - which was a bit of an adventure for me seeing that I am not Ukrainian.  I did not know what all of the foods were that came on the plate.  The waitress walked me through them and explained to me how to assemble the various items and eat them the authentic way.  It was really good.  Had the waitress not been so helpful, I probably would not have gotten it.  Definitely would eat there again"}
{"text":"I've been going to Olesia's Place for a couple of years and I absolutely LOVE it. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. Food and drinks are always fantastic. The beef stroganoff is to die for."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!   Great food and an awesome atmosphere!  Hubby's mom is Ukrainian so I knew it would be a hit with him!  Upon leaving I was asked \"why haven't we come here sooner!!??\"  Had the stuffed cabbage after reading reviews and it was amazing.  We WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, had the pierogi sampler. It was good, the service was lack luster, I think it was more because there was one waitress for the entire place, so wasn't her fault, and maybe it's better for dinner."}
{"text":"Second time here. Great food and ambience. It's like a transformation to approach from outside--an old house in a big parking lot near tractor equipment--and then step into this perfect little place with romantic lighting, fabulous home cooked authentic food, and the sound of live jazz. Do come."}
{"text":"We love this little gem. Everything we have had is good but I keep coming back for the paprikash, cabbage and stroganoff."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago and it was not good at all. There were three of us and we all agreed not to return. I ordered cabbage rolls because they are supposed to be famous for them and I was very disappointed. The service was not as I would expect either."}
{"text":"Went here because of all of the amazing reviews and have to say - it was beyond amazing. Great service. Every single dish felt and tasted like mom was in the back cooking from scratch. Chicken paprikash soup: another level of amazing. Pierogies sampler: amazing, never thought I'd say I enjoy sauerkraut pierogies as much as I did. Beef stuffed cabbages: might actually be better than my moms! Beef sliders: added some hot sauce and it was out of this world.  Again, cannot say enough great things about Olesias!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Stuff cabbage however was bland. Port tenderloin was a little over cooked. Great portion size though. No room for dessert."}
{"text":"Very out of the way for someone from the East side, but worth the trip. Located in front of a tractor store, but the interior is very classy and charming with lots of windows and dark wood. Menu is Eastern European fare, but with excellent preparation. The bread is fresh and warm, served with delicious whipped garlic butter.  Our group all enjoyed the borscht (more vegetables than the borscht I've had before), and another really enjoyed the beet cured salmon carpaccio. I ordered the salmon salad at the recommendation of a friend. Not classic Eastern European, but the huge slab of salmon was perfectly seasoned and prepared, tender and flaky. The salad was fresh with a delicious bacon dressing. Others in the group raved about the beef stroganoff. The single negative comment in the food was for the cabbage rolls, which had too much rice. The short rib pierogie special was thought to be very good. Desserts were all housemade and excellent: chocolate torte, wild strawberry cheesecake, and the Napoleon cake (soft layers of pastry layered with custard cream).  The main detractor which takes away a star was the service, which was incredibly slow on a night when it wasn't very crowded. It took over half an hour to get bread, and only after we asked. I also didn't receive my glass of wine until the first course was being served, and gratuity was automatically added to the tab for our group of five. 2.5 hours for a three course meal was a little long...  I would definitely return here for the food, but only on a night when I had plenty of patience and good company for a VERY leisurely meal."}
{"text":"Excellent waitress.  Delicious food. We had... Salads.  Pierogis. Stuffed cabbage.   Lamb chops."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while journeying down I-80. Well worth the short drive from the turnpike!  It was a Tuesday, which meant an all-day happy hour. Ordered two pierogi platters and meat pies from the HH menu, along with a stuffed cabbage with mushroom sauce. All excellent. The mushroom sauce was particularly delicious, and the pierogi are generously sized and served with cabbage, mushrooms, onion, and sour cream.  Very friendly and helpful waitress.   I didn't drink, but the drink specials on the happy hour menu were very affordable, and included interesting Eastern European beers.   I will return if I pass through the area again. It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday afternoon, but it was a large restaurant, and I hope they fill up on the weekends."}
{"text":"This was a great find. It was my first experience having Ukrainian cuisine and it was a delight. The ambience is great, the food is delicious and the service is pleasant. If you are looking for a delightful evening this is the place to be.   Firstly you have the option of having a cozy dark interior ambience or the cool outdoor seating. We choose the outdoor seating and enjoyed the karaoke playing at the time. Beautiful music is a great plus to the ambience.  Second the food has great options from perogies to  scallops to lobster. We took lot of time deciding which one to order. But the waitress was very helpful and patient in explaining every item in the menu. Finally we ordered perogie platter, pork tenderloin with perogies & blackened scallops. It was tasty and we enjoyed every bit of the meal. Special mention to wine here- one of the best we have tasted across.  Finally all the food and the ambience is incomplete without service. The service here is exactly what is required. The waitress was courteous and patient with us. She was fast and served us well. We really enjoyed in here."}
{"text":"This place made a wonderful first impression! Cozy atmosphere, tentative employees, and a delicious meal. I had the salmon stuffed with crab. It took everything I had not to finish it (I really wanted the leftovers for the next day) They had a live duo performing an excellent variety of tunes on a Saturday night. The husband and I are a sucker for being serenaded during dinner :) We can't wait to make this place a regular when in the Strongsville area. Our only disappointment was that we forgot our leftovers on the table. We whined about it for two days...it was that delicious."}
{"text":"This place is confused if it is American or Ukrainian. I tried the American menu and was not impressed. I had a burger, well done. The size was great, the taste was great. It was still raw in the middle. Did I mention it was well done? Maybe the Ukrainian food is better prepared."}
{"text":"Placed a to go order today, and went to pickup the food. Dark and Dreary type environment, not a very pleasant looking place. No one in the place at all. When I took the food back, it was not even cooked. The pirogis, and the rest of the dishes were microwaved, and my sausage and peppers dinner was not at all cooked thoroughly.   I will be reporting this organization to the Health Inspector. Disgusting way to run a business.   Be forewarned!"}
{"text":"No stars for Olesia's Place! Been there a few times and loved it so much we planned to take my Mom there today for Mother's Day. Walked in at 2:30 and were told that they weren't taking any walk-ins because they had a large group for a funeral. There were empty tables and not even a closed for private event sign out! Other people came and were wanting to dine and were turned away as well. I guess we won't be back there! Make sure if you're planning to eat there you have a back up choice!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best beef stroganoff I have ever eaten. Braised short rib, mushrooms, and perfect seasoning - YUM !  Family had pierogies (something you don't find easily in MD besides Mrs. T's) and those were excellent too.  Different than the Polish version, less pasta dough and more filling.  Soups were also enjoyed along with tasty bread with garlic herbed butter.  Live music playing the Saturday evening we were there. Guitarist was very talented and did not intrude on our conversation at all."}
{"text":"I want to give 3 1/2 stars but cannot, so I am giving 3 stars.  Decided to try this place out after reading reviews and wanting to try somewhere new.    The inside is nice and somewhat cozy, for dinner I went all plain Jane and ordered the \"Olesia's burger\". The burger was HUGE topped with lettuce, onion, tomato, bacon and a fried egg! The burger was tasty, nothing \"spectacular\" but it was a traditional burger that was delicious, it also came with fries that were sub-par.  The girlfriend ordered \"the platter\" it came with pierogis, kielbasa or sausage and stuffed cabbage. She said it was delicious and also loved the borscht soup that she got as well. Not a bad place and the prices are fair!  There was also a \" vocal impressionist\" performing that was actually pretty good and covered some nice evening music.   The location is a little awkward and the building is funky, located behind the restaurant is a John Deere dealer."}
{"text":"What a cute place! We had a craving for pierogies so we looked up some suggestions on our trusted site - Yelp and VOILA! we found Olesia.   It's practically located in Strongsville on Royalton Road. It doesn't look like much from the outside. They do have a patio. It was raining so we sat in the glass patio and watched the rain cascade down like a water feature. Very cool. The inside is very cozy. I liked the ambience!  Service was great too. Everyone in my party had the peirogie sampler (we were on a mission). They were all very good. My faves were potato and sauerkraut. We also had a soup sampler. Again all soups were good but my favorite was the Red Borscht.  Thanks for another great find Yelp!"}
{"text":"On a drive by this place is nothing to look at, but from the inside it is completely different and unexpected; it is warm, inviting, and will likely have you wanting to stay a while.   Let me preface my review by first saying that to me  this type of food is home.  These are the meals I grew up with; chicken paprikash, corned beef, pierogies, stuffed cabbage... and man do I miss it.  You can't find this stuff in the South!  With a table of 8, believe me when I tell you I was snagging scraps off of everyone's plate in an effort to take it all in while I could.  It was heaven.  I recommend starting off with a cup of the chicken paprikash.  Is it gram's paprikash?  Heck no, but it's close (sorry gram, a girl's gotta eat).  For a main course, I had the Ukranian Favorites dish that comes with both stuffed cabbage and potato pierogies - delish.  My husband had the beef stroganoff and while it was very good, you should really set aside time for a nap after your meal.  You will need it.   Service was excellent.  We showed up a little after lunch the day after Christmas and although overwhelmed, it was very obvious that our server was working her butt off to make sure we had a great experience.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a nice dinner out.  Don't let the exterior fool you, it's very nicely done inside with rich materials and colors.  View is nice from the front windows.  We both started with the borscht and loved it.  My wife had the chicken crepes, I had the cabbage rolls.  I agree with the other reviewer that the ratio of rice to meat was a little high.  The mashed potatoes were outstanding, garlicy and buttery.  A smooth textured blast of flavor.  For dessert we split one piece of chocolate torte.  It was properly sized as an individual dessert - it was a 'light bite' at 1/2 that.  I felt the chocolate cream was a little too light, teasing the border between a rich chocolate and a pudding.  My wife thought it was spot on though and loved it.  The service was friendly and the hostess checked on us just the right amount.  The kitchen seemed a little slow on getting the entrees out for a Monday night.  For a full dinner (soup, entree, drink, dessert) I would plan on $35 per person plus tip and tax.  Homemade food that is delicious and unique for the Cleveland food scene.  5 stars!  Update June 2015: The food is still every bit as good as ever.  We visited on a weeknight and it was somewhat slow again, which is a real shame.  For slavic European food, this place is excellent.  My parents came here from eastern Europe so I had most of these dishes homemade growing up, and I can attest Olesia is a genuine chef to her culture.  My only comment is that the decor is starting to look a little tired.  The chairs are wearing poorly.  The wood floor seems to be buckling near the entrance - maybe due to winter slush, or flooding?  They added some lighting to the row of tables against the windows, but the way they ran the power cords, hanging limp with clear tape holding the cords up is kind of tacky.  Doesn't look right in a restaurant of this status/quality.  Yes I am being picky but it's out of love, hopefully they can correct a couple minor aesthetics so it doesn't turn off new customers."}
{"text":"Pricey.  Drinks expensive,  Bartenders with lots of cleavage, Terrible food, terrible service. Long wait to be seated. Do not recommend. Servers lack personality."}
{"text":"I have to admit.  It wasn't what I was expected.  I came in thinking Ukrainian food had to be comfort food, served in a townie bar sort of place reminiscent of Sokolowskis.  Instead of that, I found a very classy and modern establishment with lots of garden rooms, windows, fireplaces with leather and rich chocolate colored accents.  It's a perfect date place!  We first ordered the Moscow Mules which came in short, stubby little copper kettles.  It somehow made the Mule (one of my favorite drinks...if It's Russian or not!), keep cold and generally taste better somehow!  As an appetizer, we got the potato pancakes.  They came out and they were flavorful and fried.  They weren't like the latke's that I generally have around here, they were flatter and seemed to be more carefully pounded out...if that even makes sense with potatoes.    First course we got soups.  I got the chicken paprikash and my bf got the borscht.  We ended up switching because I loved the hearty yet delicate taste of beets with sour cream, and he loved the general heartiness of the paprikash.  My only negative is that the soup wasn't what I was expecting.  There are a range of paprkiashes out there and I suppose I'm more partial to the soupy and creamy Hungarian styles.  This was more of a gravy with yummy potato dumpling balls and heavy, but not hot, spices.  Main entree we got the short rib crepe and the mushroom pierogies (with a side of mushroom cabbage roll).  Somehow we realized that we all ordered the mushroom sauce, but this wasn't a negative because it was so creamy and delicious, I could have ordered more and been happy!  The short rib crepe was almost like a beef wellington, surrounded by well seasoned squashes.  The pierogis were pretty amazing...filled with sauteed mushrooms, covered with the sauce.  Everything was fresh and homey.  Our server was excellent (and Ukrainian, which I learned when she spoke to another table) and kept us happy the entire meal.    Overall, this is a place that is in no-man's land between Strongsville and Broadview Hts.  I honestly am looking forward to returning and I hope it continues to do well!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I had the tuna tartar as an appetizer.  $10 for the amount of tuna you get is the deal if the century.  For dinner I had the short rib perogies.  I would order them again for sure.  My wife had the lemon garlic salmon which was very good too.  We will be going back!"}
