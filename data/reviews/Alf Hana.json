{"text":"Alf Hana definitely feels like a take-out restaurant. It's very simple and it's nothing fancy. It's not crowded like at Osmow's but it's not comfy to dine in either.

We ordered a chicken shawarma plate to go. I believe it was about the same price as Osmow's 'chicken on the rocks' but this included a salad which I liked, especially because the lettuce was fresh. The chicken and the garlic sauce was good. It was a decent portion; I believe it can feed two light eaters or two individuals looking for a light meal. 

If I'm ever in the area and I don't feel like eating pho, this would definitely be another option for me. I'll probably give their chicken shawarma a try next time."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new shawarma place in Meadowvale Town Centre. It's not located inside the centre itself, it's in the row of strip mall stores just beside the centre, in between the Popeye's Supplements, the Vietnamese restaurant, EB Games, and TheSource. You can sit and eat there, they have tables and have improved it a bit so you can go there for lunch though it still feels a bit like a take-out place.

The food....the shawarma wraps are good, I think they only have chicken wraps and not beef but they do have kabobs. The chicken wrap here is a bit distinct from the other ones I've head (mainly the 4+ in Streetsville). The reason is because they add a bit more of some type of seasoning to the chicken and also because of their garlic sauce. It has a very seasoned tomato type of taste, I can't really describe it. Most shawarma places use a garlic sauce which really improves the taste but they use a garlic paste which is a bit too strong and doesn't work as well. It is good though but not the best shawarma you'll have and not better than the Streetsville ones. The platters are also good but again, nothing special. The menu doesn't have a lot of variety, just the basic sides like rice and falafel.

The problem though is that the prices are slightly higher than the other shawarma places without the shawarma being better. You can usually get just the wrap for $5 or a wrap + pop and sometimes side for $5-7 at lots of other Mississauga places. Over here, just the wrap costs $6 and the plates are all above $11. They do however have some lunch specials for students like a $4 chicken wrap. The platter/plates have decent quantity and taste good but the exact same thing is cheaper at several other shawarma places. There's other food options in Meadowvale Town Centre but this is the only place that sells shawarmas. I'm fairly sure based on taste and the sauce they use that the shawarma has high sodium content so it's not unhealthy but not exactly a healthy or cheap meal to make going here on a regular basis worth it, more of a once in a while place."}
{"text":"Best beef shawarma that I have ever had. The toppings are always fresh and the meat is delicious. I'm not a fan of the chicken however. 
The service is ok nothing special."}
{"text":"Good chicken wraps but I first ordered 2 dishes and 2 wraps, I got the first dish no problem then I got the 2nd dish with reasonable timing but when it came down to the wraps after 5mins from the 2nd dish I went up to ask about the wraps and the lady said oh I'm sorry. So basically I have to go to her to ask about it to remind her.
It also cost me $51"}
{"text":"Amazing would recommend it to anyone !  they have a great promotion going on now  their shwarma is sooo  tasty and they top it off with home made zezki sauce and if u like it spicy their hot sauce is home made."}
{"text":"The taste of chicken Shawarma is amazing and juicy , I love this place.

I recommend this place to whom like strong flavor and taste."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to this restaurant for take out, and I was happy with both visits. 

Tonight, I ordered the chicken shawarma dish for myself and shared a falafel wrap.

The chicken shawarma dish was tasty and filling. Note that the chicken shawarma seems to be mixed with some sauce (not including the sauces they add on top). I loved it, but it is a little different than other shawarma places and may not be for everyone. 

The dish comes with rice, salad, and some crispy bits of pita I think (not exactly sure what the crispy bits were, but I loved it). The sauces were excellent too. The falafel wrap was also delicious. The portions are pretty good as well.

My only real complaint is the price. Wraps are $6 and the dishes $13. The price for wraps is fine, but the dishes are pretty expensive for a local take out type of place. For $13, you would think it would at least come with a drink or more food.

However, they currently have a promotion and the wraps are only about $4 and the dishes are $10. If those where the regular prices, I may have given this place 5 stars.

Yet, price aside, this is a great place with great food, and I will be back often."}
{"text":"Meh, not good. I ordered a chicken shawarma platter for $14. I saw them take the chicken from a pot on the stove. It was not cut fresh from the shawarma. $14 for a left-over tasteless chicken, meh rice and salad was too much. I regret getting it. It was not tasty and have had a lot better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place serves a great chicken shawarma as well as chicken on fries dish. Their sauces are delicious and their price point is good, especially their daily deals. Watch out for the spice level! I prefer the location at meadowale town center."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and had the chicken shawarma. Excellent quality, not too salty like some we have tried. Will definitely go back, excellent value as well, 2 for $10!! Good staff and speedy service ."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever, go to paramount way more delicious and authentic plus great customer service,and no am not sponsored by Paramount !"}
{"text":"I came to this place with some co-workers at my new job and I have been coming this place since then and it hasn't change the taste a bit in years.

The marination of the chicken is just amazing, very different then other shawarma places. The quality and quantity will keep you coming back.

Make sure you bring cash as they will push down the transactional charge for the  credit card company of $0.25 right back to you as this is a family run restaurant and not a chain they need to survive.  

over the year or so they have improved on the seating quality and now you can sit down for a quick meal before heading out."}
{"text":"This place is great! Its a bit of a drive but is my \"go-to\" for chicken shwarma. By far the best I've had. Place is small but food is delicious. 

Eaten here more than 50 times and always happy with portion and taste.

Now offer just a rice and chicken meal which great but I like to add the pink turnips as well.

So far no one has been disappointed with the food that I have made recommendations.

Only drawback is service, bit slow, not overly talkative, but its the food Im there for.

Great place, go try it."}
{"text":"Good  shawarma ... well done and very helpful staff.
The place is neat ,clean and tidy . All staff washes hands regularly and wear head cap and gloves.
Highly  recommended."}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday after waiting for a LONG time. And frankly, it was fine. For me, the best middle eastern food I have eaten so far in Mississauga is hands down at Lazeez. 

Although if you are craving for some Middle Eastern and don't want to wait in line then I would recommend you give this place a shot. 

On the negative side, I thought this place is a little bit more expensive than Lazeez. Hence, 3 stars."}
{"text":"The seating is very tight and worn out, not a very welcoming atmosphere. Smells very bad, no air conditioning and lots of smoke. Quality of food is poor, food poisoning every time I go there. Not sure how it passed health inspection. And the service is very poor, cashier gets very aggressive."}
{"text":"Nothing special. This is a place you go to because your just so-hungry-and-its convenient type-of establishment. Its not premium, its average. Nothing to wet your pants about. The guy and the girl look pissed off most of the time. No music, just silence and an eerie hum from the fridge for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Shawarma places are popping up by the thousands and I intend to try them all.  

The standard size of pita used by many establishments all over the GTA and surrounding areas is considered a large and they charge an extra $2.00 for the upgrade here.  

Lunch for 2 with drinks and sandwiches came up to just over $20.00

I was a little surprised that at these steep prices... they don't even have much of a variety for toppings.  Just the basics you would expect, but nothing more.  

At these prices I would expect that they would cook the falafel right before my eyes, but instead it was made whenever at who knows time.  

I'd give the 2 stars just for the taste.  But anything more would be outright lying."}
{"text":"The Topping variety is okay but the chicken is usually dry and the marination is kind of weak. The loud fridge creates a weird atmosphere as there is no music running combined with lacklustre workers. Could be so much better. Still better than Madina though."}
{"text":"So, we've been to this place twice within a period of only two weeks and on both occasions, I ordered just the falafel wrap by itself since I eat light in the evenings & just wanted a snack. The wrap itself is huge for one person like me to finish so I kept one half and gave the other half to my husband as an add on to his shawarma plate. I'm giving 4 stars because I love the taste of this sandwich and also how we're allowed to customize what ingredients we want in it. The toppings I chose were tomatoes, lettuce, green vegetable mix (sorry, I don't know the proper name), onions, radish, garlic sauce, and tzatziki sauce, which made this sandwich very tasty. However, be prepared to wait about 15 mins. for them to cook the falafel because they make that fresh on the spot. 

Customer service, I would rate as satisfactory. They were cordial and met the bare minimum requirements to be polite to us and give us all that we needed but at the same time, they lacked that personal touch to help make themselves stand out. Prices, as previous reviews have stated, are indeed on the expensive side when comparing with other fast food shawarma places that I've been to. If the falafel sandwich didn't taste so amazing, I would have actually given an overall rating of 3 stars.

On the whoIe, I will keep coming back here in the future, for convenience sake, as it's only minutes from our place and is in the same plaza where we do all our errands. Maybe, next time I'll try one of their rice dishes too."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! I purchased the chicken shawarma dish (Twice!) which was probably one of the best I've had(the texture was just amazing and the quantity of the sauces were as I had hoped). My only objection was the pricing; compared to other joints it is far more costly (I should point out that the serving size seems like it is intended for 1 and half persons). I will definitely be coming back whenever I am within the Meadowvale area. If possible, if they could make the serving size a little smaller but lower the price slightly I think it would be quite beneficial and they would obtain 5 stars from me no doubt. Nonetheless, well done!"}
{"text":"I came across this place during a random visit to Meadowvale Town Centre. The chicken shawarma was fine, but nothing to rave about,, and also priced slightly higher than other shawarma places. Service was rather slow the day I went, but maybe it's not always so. Overall, this place is all right and should do the trick if you're in the neighbourhood and craving a shawarma."}
{"text":"Saying that a Shawarma pita sandwich is mediocre at best would be hard to believe. I have been to a few Shawarma places in the area, Pita Place, Osmow's Grill (real weird name for a Middle Eastern joint) and Pita Nutso, but I have to say Alf's Shawarma beats them all when it comes to bad Shawarma. First it tasted good because they use tzatziki sauce and I was biting it and the veggies. Once you bite out of the chicken, you realize this doesn't even remotely taste like Shawarma. These were the feelings shared by my partner. We would say we're probably Shawarma connoisseurs by now. At the same time, they didn't even honour two of their measly $1 off coupon since I was buying two Shawarma and only had one coupon, you know, like you would honour a new customer so they might come back?  They would've had to give me this Shawarma free of charge and I would've still not given it more than a star. I would stay away. There are much better places to enjoy Shawarma or they'd have to first learn how to make one."}
