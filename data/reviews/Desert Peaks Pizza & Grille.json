{"text":"I had been here once before a couple years ago. I should have stayed away. The gyro meal was terrible with no taste. I do not recommend. The bartender and waitress seemed nice though."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Needs updated but a great little sports bar none the less.  Place has good food, great beer prices and the best bartender, Shawna in the valley.   LUV YA SHAWNA!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered carry out pizza at least a dozen times from this place.  It has always been pretty good, especially the crust.  Tonight they screwed up the order, which I didn't realize until I got home.  When I called to let them know, I was told the only way to make it right was for me to come back in for another pizza tonight.  A guy that I assume is the manager told me he made what I ordered (not possible), they don't give credit, and apparently just to be a smart ass told me they have buy on get one free on Monday but not today.  I told him I won't be coming back and he said \"OK, fine\"."}
{"text":"It is okay.  Fine for drinks.  Tacos were pretty good.  Nachos are not good.  They use those nasty red and green chips and that gross velveta fake cheese sauce."}
{"text":"We have been back twice for the famous fish fry!  On our second visit, we took a friend.  Then we recommended the fish fry to friends who could not stop raving about the good quality of fish and all of the side dishes."}
{"text":"This trip to Desert Peaks was not so good. I was really let down, as i have had some great experiences here. Pizza was not as ordered/billed and was very undercooked. Wings were pretty good, but again not as good as I've had there. The place was busy and seemed a bit understaffed. I may think about giving them one more chance."}
{"text":"Food is alright for the price, service was a little slow though. Will try again in the future."}
{"text":"My 11 year old son asked me to take him here because they have a free pool table. I have to admit I was skeptical when we walked in as it looks like a bit outdated. However, the service was great, the pizza was actually AMAZING (and I'm from Chicago so I would know), and my son and I got to play a few games of pool before and after dinner. The staff and all the patrons there were very welcoming to us whereas I thought it may be awkward to bring a kid into a place that looks more bar than restaurant. It's not close to me but I would make the drive for this place again and again. Thanks for the great Mama / Son time!"}
{"text":"Based on name alone, this place sounds like a restaurant that also has a bar.  In reality, it's a bar that happens to have food as well.  If you look at it that way, this place is just fine... great if you want a bar, not so great if you want a restaurant.  Although I've only been for lunch, I'm sure this is a fun place for happy hour or hanging out after work/on the weekends.  Like previous reviews have said, it's a dive and frequented by a lot of locals.  It's clean and there are a number of TV's.  It's just not a lunch spot.  It's got that dark bar atmosphere inside, and their sandwiches are nothing to write home about.  To be fair, I have not tried their pizza, which is their showcased menu item.  And their onion rings are fantastic.  If you come for a beer and stick to bar food I think you'll enjoy yourself.  The waitress/bartender who helped me both times I went (not sure if it was the same lady both times) was efficient and pleasant.  I won't be back for lunch, but maybe I'll try out the happy hour some day."}
{"text":"Visited Monday 11/9 because I had won a $20 gift certificate in a golf tournament.  Not knowing anything about the place, we were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the bar/restaurant.  There were a few people out on the patio (smokers, kind of a turnoff) but we were planning on sitting inside anyhow.  The bartender/waitress was very friendly and attentive, which is always good!  We split a personal pizza, a salad and a Philly cheese steak sandwich. We got the thin crust pizza and I highly recommend you try it and it was cooked perfectly.  The Philly had a heap of meat on it and the roll it was served on was fresh and just really good.  The salad was also very fresh and they have really good Ranch dressing (and I am a Ranch snob!)  So, I would say this is better than just \"bar food\" it seems to be teetering on fresh ingredients and someone in the back does care about what they are doing.  I will be back for lunch and or dinner soon."}
{"text":"Well it's a dive, free pool, great service, awesome nachos, every football game, I wish they had better happy hour specials. If they had good happy hour deals I would give them five. I'm a regular so my views may be tainted, ha!"}
{"text":"Good food, serviceI, and clean. Three things I expect when I go eat out. We love pizza and this was one of the best so far!"}
{"text":"Great fries!! Great service!! Cocktail sauce was perfect!! Looking forward to trying the pizza !!!"}
{"text":"A very attentive waitress and excellent tasting food! I had the Patty melt and it was juicy and flavorful! I've been coming here for many years and it is always dependable for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Great service .. great beer battered fries and bloody Mary's.  Good local bar and grill mellow and friendly for a Saturday lunch . They play multiple sports including speed vision! PERFECT for motorcycle/motogp racing fans like myself!"}
{"text":"Well where to start....the owner took s perfectly good patio and turned it into a smoking jail. All the chairs are tied down and all in a circle like you're attending an AA meeting. 3 table out there but the chairs cannot be moved so that you can use the table to eat.  As for the food. I ordered a pizza. The menu lies. It's far from great unless you prefer burnt outside crust and raw dough in the center. If you do then come on down.    If your a business owner looking for a new location please stop by. This owner is quickly running this place into the ground."}
{"text":"this is a business located in the fry's grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but don't bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked. I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner. it's always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house."}
{"text":"If you're looking to become a regular somewhere, this place is it. Delicious pizza, good beer, a friendly bartender and owner with stories to tell. We felt welcomed here, and will soon be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is an awesome neighborhood find! Great service- we've only been there a couple of times and the server remembers what drinks we ordered last time! The food is amazing and a wonderful surprise to a bar atmosphere! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Although the food here is quite good, I cannot recommend it to anyone.  It is obvious their customers do not come first! I had 1/2 of their chef salad not too long ago, bit into something hard and fractured my tooth. I was in obvious pain! The waitress offered to get me a new salad, which I refused, as I couldn't chew. She then proceeded to take my salad plate into the back. I never had the chance to inspect it.  Her and the owner apparently went through the salad and said there was nothing in there. She then brought me the same salad to go! She apologized profusely but that was it. When I went back in the following week to tell them the dentist needs to surgically remove the \"perfectly good\" tooth I fractured, they said they would talk to their insurance! They didn't even take the salad off of the bill and never offered anything else.  Since this time, their insurance has refused to pay and now I am out $3000.00! By the way, my dentist informed me that he has had several restaurant incidents which every time the restaurant paid, this includes McDonald's!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for a Friday night fish fry.  While the price has climbed in recent years, it is now $12/pp, it is all you can eat and the fried cod is excellent.  We've brought guests here several times and they all rave about the fish fry.  The atmosphere is nothing fancy, its more midwestern neighborhood bar/greasy spoon, but the food is good to excellent.  We've also had the pizza and burgers and they are very good, too.  Wait staff is outstanding; even if they don't know you they make you feel at home.  My only complaint is I can't sit outside on nice nights because the patio is dedicated to smokers - you can see and smell the cloud of tobacco smoke lingering over the patio as you approach the entrance.  Yuk!!!  I honestly don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"The place is called DESERT PEAKS now. I and 3 coworkers went yesterday for lunch. Our company relocated our office off of McKellips. We have been trying to look for a good lunch place. DESERT PEAKS has now been crossed off our list. We must have gotten the hemorrhoid waitress also. She was not attentive to our needs at all. She was more concerned on flirting for tips with her bar patrons. It took 30 min for us to receive our food. (there was only one other table for 2 seated) When she brought our food out to us she placed it in front of us and immediately turned and walked off. She did not ask if everything looked ok or if she could bring us anything else. I actually  did need sauce and cheese for my italian sausage sandwich and my friend needed ranch for her fries. I sat without touching my meal hoping she would come and check on us. The waitress never came back. After 15 minutes my friend finally got her attention to come to the table. I asked for my sauce & cheese and ranch. She took my plate. Then came back said she forgot what the other request was. We told her ranch. She brought back the ranch and my plate. My fries were now cold. One of my friends had pizza. His dough was not baked in the middle. It was very soggy and alot of grease was formed on the top from the pepperoni. It was a HORRIBLE experience. She was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average. This is coming from someone that eats lunch out 5 times a week."}
{"text":"Went here with my outstanding Boeing hosts. It's a nice hangout. They had pretty good beer and the pizza was greasy but tasty. This place would get 4 stars, except for the fact that when our rental car wouldn't start in the parking lot, about 7 staff and patrons huddled around the car, hood and keys trying to help us one. A couple of people even went down to the radio shack to get us a new battery. When that didn't help a guy went and got his toolbox and helped us disconnect the battery. After reconnection, it worked! Thanks so much to all of you."}
{"text":"If you live within 3 miles of this place.....it's your local \"Grille\".  It is a place to go after work or an after \"workout\" place to get  drink.  Jen the bartender, is awesome.  It's like walking into your local Starbucks and she already is making your drink.  Yes, this place is in a shopping mall pad, so the atmosphere is all locals...but I think that's why we all come here.  The staff knows who comes on Mondays, Tues. Weds.....that's us!!!! etc.  Due to the fact, we only come here after our workouts.....we have only had their veggie pizza...not bad.  But, Jen makes a great a low calorie concoction...which  I can't name right now-working on the patent.  You come here because the bar service is great and they have cold beer!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. We enjoy the Swedish meatballs , nachos and such.   The chilli is good stuff.  Always has current sports games and friendly servers ."}
{"text":"Very good Philly cheesesteak. So filling and cheesesteak was so full, i couldn't finish it! Service was great! Will recommend to others! If you want to play pool, they have that here too!"}
