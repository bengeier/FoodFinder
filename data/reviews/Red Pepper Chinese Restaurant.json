{"text":"No way!  I hope these guys did not shut down.  I ate at this place shortly after I returned home from China.  They were excellent and pretty darn close to being authentic.  I wanted to add them as one of my fav Chinese restaurants.  The spicy eggplant dish is called \"yu xiang qie zi\" , fish smelling eggplant - literally translated.  It has no fish in it at all and does not taste like fish at all.  Not sure why they call it that.  It is one of my favorite Chinese dishes as well.  I had that there as well, they did a great job.  I also had a whole fish there that was wonderful."}
{"text":"This restaurant closed a few years ago--the building was sold for the construction on 51 here (aside E. Wash). It was rumored to be reopening at a new location. Any word??  They had great food--especially a spicy eggplant dish I can't quite duplicate at home."}
{"text":"The Red Pepper is BACK! :)))))) It is now called Tom's Red Pepper.   We only discovered it by seeing the ad in the yellow pages.  It has moved to a small store front location on the west side.  Although it is now technically a take out or delivery restaurant, there are two tables in the shop so you can eat in if you prefer.  The menu is the same, and just as good as we remembered.  The owners have said they are keeping their eyes open for an east side location to move to.  Let's hope!

They have a webpage, www.tomsredpepper.com and are located at: 1019 N. Gammon Rd. Middleton, WI  608-831-1221"}
