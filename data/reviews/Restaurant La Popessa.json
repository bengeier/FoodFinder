{"text":"The pasta here was one of the best meals I had in Montreal - and one of the least expensive too!"}
{"text":"Ma ma miaaaa.

1. Les pâtes c'est la vie.
2. On peut comparer leur concept au subway: tu choisis tes pâtes, ta sauce et tes condiments. Le tout est cuit directement devant toi sur le feu.
3. tout est très goûteux et excellent. Choix de végé, viande ou fruits de mer.
4. ils ne sont pas cheap dans les portions
5. C'est pas trop cher pour un dîner étant donné tout ce qui est cité précédemment
6. Ils ont du vin !! demi-litre ou au verre, rouge ou blanc.
7. Tu peux le prendre pour emporter, ou le manger dans la salle a manger, attention, c'est plutôt plein le midi, le palais de Justice est juste a côté, sans compter la tour banque nationale. Ça en fait du monde ça !!"}
{"text":"Cool idea. Like Emilie B. said, it's like the Subway of pastas, except with the quality turned up a notch.

Service is quick, and the pasta is pretty good, considering this is almost fast food. Choose your pasta, your sauce combination (which is just a pre-set order of protein, vegetables, dairy and sauce) and you're off. They also have combo options and side orders if you'd like.

In Quebec fashion, order a glass of wine or beer and take it all to your seat.

I believe they also do take-out, which would be a good idea for a quick, decent Italian munch.

Value of this place is perfect. Again, this doesn't mean the pasta is amazing -- but worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. No one wants ro work there, they are pissed when customers walk in"}
{"text":"Une endroit parfait pour casser la croute rapidement en finissant de travailler ! Comme c'est nous qui decidons les ingedient et les pates, il est impossible de ne pas apprecier son repas. J'ai choisi les penne au 5 fromages, excellent !"}
{"text":"If looking for spaghetti bolognaise (meat sauce) for $8.95, with an ok portion, just to get to the next meal, then this your place to be.

The meat sauce was watery, and for some reason sweet.  The pasta was just a tad still hard.

It came with a warm bun so that was nice. 

I made my pasta dish into a trio by adding a canned pop and ceased salad. The salad portion was small, like it was meant for a bird, with watered dressing (how is that even possible!), and luckily the pop was canned and not fountain.

What a disappointing experience.  It was nice tho' that since it was a Wednesday early dinner/late lunch meal that there was no one else in the resto, so no wait time."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at this Popessa 2 years ago and their pasta was always fresh and good, something that can satisfy my cravings of pasta. I just went back today and it was not good at all. Had linguine with the chicken cacciatore sauce: the linguine was not even fresh it became so dry before serving that the pasta was cracking, the tomato sauce was not flavourful and tasted sweet rather than savoury. Their utensils were not all that clean either. Not impressed with the quality of the food, compared to what it used to be."}
{"text":"Just no. Don't do it. There are other places to find food, like McDonalds, or the half sandwich you left in your bag from yesterday. 

The pasta portion of our meal was prepared immediately. We paid at the cash and where told that the pizza and garlic bread would be brought to the table shortly. Unless shortly means never, then shortly never came. As our pasta went from warm to cold, I finally went back to check on both the pizza and garlic breads progress (because really, who eats their garlic bread AFTER their pasta?). I was informed by the surly pizza maker that he had already made our pizza. Um... my distinct lack of pizza begs to differ. There was also no sign of the garlic bread. I was again told it would be brought to the table. Time passes. I get up to check again only to see them removing two charcoal briquettes that may have once resembled garlic bread from the oven and putting them on a plate. I think they may have caught the expression on my face because they very quickly turned away from me, dropped the briquettes in the garbage and put 2 new pieces of bread in the oven. 

When the garlic bread (and pizza) finally did arrive, what was left of our pasta was stone cold, but even hot, it left much to be desired. My partners linguini was gummy, the apples in my fancy brie and apple ravioli where giant, floppy, wedges of sour inedibleness, and the amount of (cheddar?) cheese the threw on our daughters pizza barely qualified it as a cheese pizza.

I can't say the indigestion we all suffered from on the car ride home made me any more inclined to ever eating here again. My can of Brio soda however was excellent. Best part of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is like a Subway of pasta. Here's why: 

They have three sauces: tomato, cream, rosé (when they mix both together) 

They have a variety of pastas (about 10), which include ravioli, spaghettini and fettucine. 

Then, they have a large menu of sauces divided into four groups: Meat (including pork, beef and chicken), seafood, vegetarian and cheese sauces. 

The point is that you choose what you want in all three groups. Et voilà: You have your meal! 

However, if you go there for lunch, there is a special. You can choose one of the sauces on the lunch menu plus one type of pasta (not all of them are available). With that, you get a drink and small dessert, like a tiny cupcake. This is an excellent bargain for about $9. 

So far, I've had: Bolognese, Bavarian (tomato sauce and sausages) and Manhattan (tomato sauce, mushrooms, shrimps, onions). 

I'll be honest here: it's nothing like my mother's bolognese sauce. There aren't as many spices and flavours. However, if you want a quick and healthy lunch, this is a very good option. But go early: the place is packed by 12:30.

Also, the service is very quick and efficient. The lines move very fast. But you might have a problem finding a chair, even if the place is quite big."}
{"text":"Great value for the food. Once you get to know the staff after a few visits, you'll even start having fun while you wait for your food to sizzle in front of you. I like their various forms of pasta, but I also really recommend their pizza menu. The first time I tried their veggie pizza I was so delightfully surprised that it has become my IT item on the menu."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! A group of 14, eating in 15 mins and everyone was satisfied!!! Great food, great service, super good price!!!! You wont be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. We came here for dinner one night expecting a similar experience we had at Vapianos (similar style restaurant). The employees looked absolutely miserable and the food was not fresh but frozen. It tasted like something out of a can and they even burned the garlic bread. How do you burn garlic bread?!? Don't come here, keeping walking a little bit further for a better selection of restaurants."}
{"text":"Want to grab something cheap but still has the essence of an italian dish? Look no further! This is the place! Choose your pasta, choose your dish, and maybe make it a combo (adds a sweet drink and a salad or 2 garlic breads, AND STILL CHEAP). Friendly decor! You can also see your food being made in front of you! How awesome is that ??? it's like a coffee shop but with pasta!!!! No it's not fancy at all, but good food is what we want! Fast and good for the price!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and good choice in old Montreal, not really at resto but caffeteria, yummy dishes little terrasse in summers. Many tables."}
