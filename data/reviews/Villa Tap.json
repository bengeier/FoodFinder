{"text":"Tuesday Afternoon Burger Lunch Review. Always liked the Villa. Neighborhood place without a lot of \"Jukebox Stopping\" when you walk in (you know, where you walk in and the record on the jukebox screetches to a halt and everyone stares at you.)  Came in this Tuesday. Barkeep very friendly (as usual) told me of the Gyro special and the soup, but sadly, the fryer was D.O.A. NO FRIES. Well, ,ok by me, burger's the name of my game. Got the Bacon Cheese with Cheddar and the Greenage (Lettuce tomato), make the onions fried. Burger came hot and sassy. Can't complain about the taste, good as always, but the bun is another matter. Tasty, but it just couldn't stand up to the grease from the meat and the onslaught of fried onions and the juice of tomato. I would recommend it, especially for the cost, but if you go with a burger at the villa tap, skip the greenage and get your onions raw."}
{"text":"Chico's Villa Tap is my favorite fish fry in Madison.  They offer cod, walleye, perch, and JUMBO fried shrimp.  The cod is my personal favorite with the shrimp a close second.  Get your baked potato loaded.   The Villa Tap is pretty small - I love going in on a Friday night just to see how a kitchen that small (it takes up a small portion of space behind the bar) puts out so much food consistently well.  Always worth the wait.   The staff is super; always smiling, joking, and happy to fill your glass!    I also had a tasty Bloody Mary my last visit."}
{"text":"I've had deep fried shrimp in a lot of places, but the Villa's is the best I've had anywhere in southern Wisconsin. They're big, the batter is just the right thickness, and the flavor is so good you won't bother with the provided shrimp sauce. The cod is very good too, and I've heard good things about the walleye, but the shrimp is my go-to for good Friday night eating. Get there early though as the wait after six or so can be VERY long."}
{"text":"This is a perfect \"dive bar.\" Service was slow but, drinks are priced well and food was amazing - so, we didn't mind at all. I'd come if you have time to site and enjoy the people watching and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"One liner:  perch rocks  If you are looking for an awesome perch fish fry, Villa is your place.  One of the best I have eaten...light greasing and no grease.  It is Canadian Lake perch if that matters to anyone.  Small and cozy neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great bar food this is the spot on the NE side of town.  Most people rave about the Friday fish and burgers, but to be honest I've not had a bad meal here.  Drinks are reasonable, and he has a good beer selection. It's not much for ambiance, but that's not what the place is."}
{"text":"The Villa Tap has a great friday fish fry and daily specials. Chico and all the bartenders treat you like a regular. This place saves you the trip up north."}
{"text":"A very typical slice of the Wisconsin bar scene.  Low key, no frills, tasty food and a wide variety of beers.  Jukebox with a little bit of everything and pool tables.  If you want to be sociable, you can sit around the bar, or if you want to hide out from society (as I often do) you can sit in the backroom and drink.  Food was good, but, again, no frills.  Burgers come with chips on the side if you don't order an appetizer of fries.  I heard a few customers raving about the fish fry and it seemed to be quite popular.  We got there at around 8:00 and dinner was winding down.  Cheap, too.  About $60 for two burgers, eleven beers and a shot.  Don't ask me why I thought it'd be a good idea for my date and I to drink that much alcohol, but luckily Villa Tap is close enough to walk to..."}
{"text":"Just a very comfortable and friendly neighbourhood bar that has bartender's without attitudes and food and drinks at the upper end of quality and value!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for their Friday fish fry. Have had their Walleye, Perch, Cod,and Blue Gill and all were wonderful. I like to take people with me so we can all order something different and share the fish.   The place is small and busy. People are very nice and even though everyone might be in line for more than an hour, the wait is very tolerable.  Ice cold beer and Bloody Mary's mixed with loud, happy conversation actually makes it fun.  Bottom line - my husband has dialysis every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. We try at least once a month to get his Friday switched to Saturday, simply for this fish fry."}
{"text":"8/17/13  It's close to the airport, Mallard's baseball, and Ale Asylum.  We took in some of the preseason Packer game, had a few brews, and what I'm told is the best burger in town."}
{"text":"5 stars every time.  Fish, Shrimp, Burgers.  All ridiculous.  Chico seems like a great guy.  Friendly staff.  Amazing bar food.  Amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this little gem of a neighborhood bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best \"bar burger\" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating \"townie-bar\" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!"}
{"text":"This definitely a nice gem  on Madison 's north side.  My friends invited me to the fish fry and it is easily one of the best I've had.  The walleye was superb and the service was great.  I will definitely be recommending this place and I will be back when I come back in town."}
{"text":"Looks sketch from the outside, but true fish fry happiness awaits! I have been going to this place for about one year.  The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  I had an amazing hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  The perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato.  The craft beer selection is impressive.  Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it. It's now my go to place for fish!"}
{"text":"Chico's always on his game. No idea how you keep cheerful with us crazy drunks. Actually the place isn't crazy but a fun neighborhood bar with good food and non rip off drinks.  I like that when you walk in you don't feel gawked at like some small bars tend to do.  Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"It's a bold statement, and one I've never made before: This place has the best fish fry...anywhere. At $14.75, the bluegill was superb, with breeding and taste worth waiting for. I wasn't even hungry, and brought home an incredible baked potato for breakfast. The wait was 2 hours and 5 minutes, hanging around in a packed dive bar. There's a reason this place is moving 100 meals a night..."}
{"text":"Another enjoyable and tasty visit..Tried bluegill this time which was excellent!... Service remains very good.. This really has become my \"go to\" fish fry."}
{"text":"So close to the airport, but remains off the grid. The Villa Tap neighborhood bar looks as it hasn't changed in forty years. The wooden bar is topped with a baseball cards that have a laminate over them.  Want to drink? Stop over. They have friendly bartenders and great prices. The bartenders do a nice job on the bloodies and Old Fashioneds.  Want to eat? Om nom. They have some type of food every night, but their Friday fish fry is worth going. The perch or walleye is what you should get. Even though it was busy when we were there, the servers were funny, had a good attitude, and our food came promptly. They know what the hell they are doing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.    We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.    The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.    My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times."}
{"text":"The perch was delicious, but we went at 7:30 p.m.  on a Friday night and with the wait we didn't eat until 9:30 p.m. The wait was just too long and the service did not make up for it. If we did go back it would have to be at 5:30 p.m."}
{"text":"Came in late on a Friday night. Were able to get the last order of cod they had, so went with one cod and one walleye. The cod was done really well, walleye was above average but not the best in Madison.   The owner was behind the bar frying the fish. Was awesome getting to see him in action, hand breading every piece and frying it up to a perfect golden brown.   If you love fish at a dive bar, this is your place. IF you are looking for more of an ambiance, go elsewhere.   Good, solid food with no frills."}
{"text":"We gave this a try after reading about it on madisonfishfry.com. Glad we did! We split the walleye and the perch - both were excellent, and worthy of 5 stars on their own. Washed it down with a good Old Fashioned. The only knock I have is that the sides - coleslaw, rolls, fries, and loaded potato - were just average. Otherwise, this was a great find and worth the trip over from the west side!  One piece of advice: We got there on Friday at 5:15 and it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. The table next to us had people sit down at about 6:00, and they were told it would take an hour for their food to come out, so get there early!!"}
{"text":"Finally had the Friday Fish Fry and am so glad I did! I had the shrimp which was HUGE and done perfectly. My partner had the cod and it was also done perfectly.  Very light (homemade) batter, and the cod was moist and delish! Warm rolls, great creamy coleslaw, French fries and baked potato were all hot and good. Can't beat the friendly service that is shown to everyone that walks in!  Chico does it right people, so go visit this place! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food that's not quite worth the wait on a Friday night. This is definitely a spot that has a huge draw of regulars who make a visit their entire Friday night plan. As first-timers, we were not prepared to wait nearly two hours for a table and another 30 minutes for food. I think the key is either showing up for early-bird hours, our wait until closer to 830/9 PM.   When you arrive, make your way back toward the men's room and put your name on the poster board hanging on the back wall of the bar. Be sure to include the number of people in your party. Seating appeared to go in order regardless of table size if they could fit you - we saw a group of three get seated at a six-person booth, and standing right next to the list gave us a pretty good view of the order. We also did see a group get delayed because they put themselves as a party of two but really had 5. Long story short: honesty is the best policy.   Eventually we lucked into two extra bar stools that were tucked around the corner, and that made the wait slightly less painful than having to stand pressed against the wall and constantly in the way of servers and people trying to get to the restroom.   Once we were seated we were quick to order since we'd had plenty of time to peruse the menu. We started with a basket of fries with ranch to dip, an order of spicy fried ravioli, a Pepsi, and a Shirley Temple. For entrees I opted for a cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the walleye fish fry.   Even though I didn't order fish fry, I was also served a bowl of coleslaw and a roll when our drinks came. The roll was cold but soft and helped quell the hunger pangs. The coleslaw was okay, but I'm not a huge fan of creamy coleslaw on its own so I only tried a bite. After twenty minutes or so our apps arrived. The fries were actually really good and the ranch tasted homemade. The ravioli was a good portion and we think the spice came from pepper jack cheese (though we didn't see any pepper chunks present).   Our food came ten or fifteen minutes later. My burger was also very good though basic. Soft bun, quality beef cooked to my requested temp, and a slice of cheddar cheese. Toppings like lettuce and tomato were extra so I skipped them, and your only condiment choice is the ketchup on the table. I wish they had mustard - maybe you have to request it from the kitchen? Despite being a plain Jane, it was delicious, but not wait for 2.5 hours delicious. The chips that come on the side were disappointing - I had high hopes since they list warm chips with dip as an appetizer choice, but these were just run of the mill, off-brand bulk-bagged potato chips. I would definitely skip them in the future and just sub in the fry appetizer. My boyfriend enjoyed his walleye, and it was a gigantic piece that was nearly a foot long.  Overall, I'd return on a less busy day for an affordable and tasty meal, but I'm pretty sure we'll never be back on a Friday. There are a lot of great restaurants in town with a fraction of the wait. Also, due to the high volume of people the air was thick with the smell or burnt grease that made the wait a bit unpleasant. I totally understand why this is a neighborhood staple and I want to love it, but I think I'll keep my Fridays open to other options."}
{"text":"I love the Madison dining scene, but sometimes I'm in the mood for somewhere that's more Wisconsin and less Madison.  Villa Tap is definitely one of those places.  The wait list (neon poster board and a marker - write down your name when you arrive) was surprisingly efficient.  My group of 5 enjoyed a couple drinks at the crowded bar until our table was ready (about a 30-40 min wait at 5:30ish).  The no-nonsense server was quick and funny and we waited an adequate length of time for our food to arrive.  We split the buffalo tots and they were really good - apparently they make their own sauce.  The breading on my walleye was a little heavier than I usually like, but after my pre-dinner g&ts that extra oomph was just what I needed.  I also tried my husband's perch and that was a bit lighter - think I'll try that next time.  All in all, it's a fun place for a fish fry and I heard their burgers are fab too."}
{"text":"The fish fry is truly well done. I would definitely return.  I plan to come back to try their cheeseburger and the other fried fish. This time around I got cod. The fries were good (thicker cut) but nothing special.   Helpful tip: If you want a table, get here early. By the time I rolled in at 5pm, there was no parking left and already a long wait for tables. You can sign up for a table on the whiteboard but be prepared to wait. It's worth it for fish this good!"}
{"text":"Super divey and total Wisconsin. This fish fry is worth waiting for, I was told to get he walleye (delicious) but the blue hill is also amazing. The sides aren't much but it's a great typical Wisconsin fish fry"}
{"text":"I FINALLY had the Friday fish fry. It goes from 530PM until 930... but I'd strongly suggest getting in there by 9. My friend had the perch, which was kind of chewy and too salty. The potato he got was a bit tough, too. I had the walleye and a side of fries- it was a whole different experience. The piece was huge (see pic), and the fish was just delicious. Really, perfect. They also offer cod and a jumbo shrimp dish, neither of which I've tried yet. All come with slaw, rolls and butter. Service was good, and they do have malt vinegar if you want it (I felt sheepish because I brought my own just in case...).   So, get the walleye, not the perch.   And play the jukebox."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cool bar with reasonable beers.  The Friday fish fry is spectacular.    Went there on a Tuesday, looking for a prime rib sandwich.  Out of prime rib.    Ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium.  Came back well well done.  Sent it back, second one came back well done.  Choked it down.    Will go back for the fish fry, no other night."}
{"text":"One of the best fish fry's in Madison. Great Wisconsin tavern that gives you the supper club feel. I love the atmosphere. The fish fry is fantastic. They have a variety of fish to choose from. I had the blue gill and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped at the Villa Tap the other day for a cold one, and to watch a little bit of the Badger game.  I haven't been to the Villa Tap in years. The place hasn't changed a bit.  Great neighbor hood bar.  The only down fall was--it was a little busy and took a little longer than I would have liked to get me beer.  Other that that great time--tap beer $2.50."}
{"text":"I love a place where the owner participates actively in their business.  Chico is frequently working and you can tell takes a lot of pride in his work. The food is all great ranging from the cuban pulled pork to the burgers to the chicken fingers and assortment of fry like things. It's bar food but the meat comes from Jenny St. Market so its good quality! The weekend meat raffles are fun. The mixed drinks are great. The bar tenders make it a point to get to know their customers. They also participate in the bar league which offer 'safe rides' if you should happen to enjoy yourself too much to ensure you safely get home."}
{"text":"Villa Tap has been at this location since 1976. Chico bought the place ~6 years ago and can usually be seen around.   The regulars claim that the Friday fish fry is the best in town. While it definitely is good, I wouldn't go as far as to call it the best. However, it does make for a good option for food if you have sometime before a flight (given the proximity to the airport)  Parking is limited to about ~15 cars so if you get street parking around, grab it. The place is filled with sports memorabilia and is worth a shot if you are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best fish fry in town. I hate to even give a good review because it's such a well kept secret but they deserve it.  Chico IS the man!!"}
{"text":"Best fish fry in Madison? Possibly. It's up there for sure.   Longest wait for fish fry in Madison? Probably. Worth it, but be ready.   I've only been here on Friday's for fish, so I have no idea what this place is like otherwise. But on Friday's, it's a ZOO. The bar is packed to the gills. You write your name on a board with how many are in your party and then just wait. And wait. And wait.   Once you are finally called and shown to your table, though, everything changes. The table are in the back, away from the chaos of the bar. It's dim and quieter. Service has always been great for me when I have been in, and once you order, the food comes out pretty quick. All of the fish is great, but I recommend the walleye. Nom nom nom."}
