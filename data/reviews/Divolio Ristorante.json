{"text":"An average Italian restaurant with a beautiful setup & design but the food is really average. It's a byow (bring your own wine) theme which is a plus but the food is really average. The staff is friendly & nice. But I have to admit their coffee was excellent & the best I have ever tasted. Desert was very good as well but the rest needs to wow me."}
{"text":"Food is ok , nothing special, had a much better Italian food. Good nice, tasty but not different from any other restaurant.  The stuff was very polite, professional and pleasant. Food came in timely manner, however we received the checks without asking for. Overall it was a nice lunch. I may return as i didn't really had a bad experience ."}
