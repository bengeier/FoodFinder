{"text":"I'm pretty sure it's a health code violations to chop plastic into passion fruit pulp and then serve it to people with small pieces of plastic in it. Pretty sure this is a very big health code violations actually. The manager is rude but the rest of the staff are quite nice. There's not a single option on the menu that doesn't have some form of sweet filler... Can anyone just get a vegetable juice in this place?"}
{"text":"Smoothies were good but overpriced for the size. I'm also surprised that they don't offer an extra large option.  On a recent visit I ordered my smoothie and two women who came after me got theirs first. The teenager making the smoothies had forgotten to pour mine out of the blender. Most people buying food in a hospital are in a rush because they are their for a medical reason, either for themselves of family. He wasted my time and didn't apologize."}
{"text":"I love all the healthy juices and smoothies. I'd always stop by the nearest Booster Juice Bar. For classics, I like the very berry, breezy banana or the pineapple freeze. For the freshly squeezed, I like the Maui juice. For boosters, I go for POWER, ENERGY or my favorite, the WARRIOR. Some days I go hardcore smoothies. Il like Tropi-Kale and terminator.  These warrior smoothies are great after long flights. I also like the pomegranate passion. I plan to taste all the flavors. I'm not a fan of Matcha Monsoon, Unbeetable and I C Carrots. Quality of the drinks are pretty much the same in the its branches."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Two employees as seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving customers."}
