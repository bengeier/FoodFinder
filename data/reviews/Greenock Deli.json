{"text":"The folks at The Greenock Deli take special care in their menu items. My all time favorite is their pulled pork sandwich platter, which is as good a sandwich of this kind I've found anywhere, including an Arkansas barbeque spot where this was the featured item. Don't be put off because it's not haut cuisine. It's superior food at an excellent price, and it's virtually around the corner. Get over there and tell Marlene and the staff to get you a helping. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  So this place is just a little hole in the wall convenience store / deli / sandwich shop.  But this place is just fantastic!  I love the sandwiches! Try the Oberdick Hoagie, which is their version of an Italian Hoagie.  They have homemade desserts too!  The staff is very helpful too!  Go out if your way to try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"When I first started going the sandwiches and cookies were amazing! Slowly the quality has dwindled... lately if you order a sandwich, it has very little meat and potato chip crumbs rather than chips...BUT, if you catch it on a good day, they're great! More often than not they are out of pepperoni roll (which are excellent) and they changed the chocolate chip cookies and they are not as good."}
{"text":"Always fresh always clean. There are a few things i have not liked but that will happen. Sandwiches are good.

They have great prices on cheese and lunch meat. Always 25% or more savings than buying at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Ham salad is good, gator sub is good, (second to decarlos for value) they use sweet/hot pickles which are awesome! 
The deli has a cute little selection of jellys and chips. 
Pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Good food, good people. I was biking along the Great Allegheny Passage near Boston, looking for a place to buy lunch or a snack at 2pm, preferably not junk food, and this popped up. There's a hill to climb from the trail, but I think it was worth it. My friend got a custom-made turkey salad and I tried their broccoli salad and a small zucchini bread. The food was good; we ate it on their shady picnic table out front. If they had a vegetarian sandwich option (I didn't see one in my quick scan) I would have preferred that. As they get more vegetarian customers perhaps they'll broaden in that direction. It would be nice if they could open a sandwich bar on the trail; there are few quality food options in this area."}
{"text":"I never liked Ham Salad until I tried thiers, now I'm addicted. They have awesome sandwiches with names of roads in the area. My favorite is the constitution. Delicious baked goods too, friendly staff, daily specials."}
{"text":"It's good to have a community store in this day and age. The Greenock Deli does indeed have a deli, and the sandwiches are excellent. They bake their own pastries and cookies which are also pretty good, and the homemade pepperoni rolls are a real treat."}
