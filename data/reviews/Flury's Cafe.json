{"text":"Very good food. Our server took our order and then she cooked it on the stove less than 10 feet away. I felt like I was at my grandma's house, and I loved every minute of it.  We ordered biscuits and gravy and banana pancakes.  Everything was very tasty and cooked perfectly.  Just a few complaints:  prices are kinda high and portions are kind of small...  Plus, I ordered a choc chip cookie for dessert, but it was too crisp for my liking.  I like a chewier, softer cookie (like what I make at home). Oh well - I can't have everything, right?  Still, very good restaurant."}
{"text":"What can I say? I like this place a lot.  It's small, a little cramped, the interior decor is a whole lotta thrift shop, and the staff is as casual as can be. But the food is great, and it's made with love.  It's the type of place you wish you lived within walking distance of, so you could mosey over in your pjs for breakfast and a cookie. A delightful joint."}
{"text":"Walking into the Diner I got a very cliquish feel, just a general cold and indifferent treatment. I wasn't greeted right off the bat, I asked him if it's seat yourself and I got a bit of an attitude. The booth I sat at had service setup for two people but there was semidried syrup on the table and crumbs, like they just set the table without cleaning it. I had the sausage gravy and biscuits that came with eggs, it was a brown gravy, mediocre at best, but the biscuits were tasty. The hash browns were nothing to write home about, just your standard hydrate in carton hash browns, for the price it was not a good value and I declined the eggs that was included in the meal .  The service was so so, no one came and asked me how my food was. I came with it and my bill wasn't adjusted accordingly? to reflect the fact that I didn't get eggs with a meal. I'm comparing this to my experience at Fred diners and Akron which the food is phenomenal"}
{"text":"I had the three cheese omelet (with ham for extra $$) with hash browns and a homemade biscuit. The omelet was okay but I wish they would have put the cheese into the omelet instead of putting sliced cheese on top of it. The hash browns were also okay as well. The biscuit was as dry as a bone. Over all it was an average meal for $12"}
{"text":"Flury's is a little cafe in the middle of Cuyahoga Falls.

They always have some very good items both on and off the menu and quality is better than average.

Service can be a little slow as it is usually just two or three people covering cooking and serving.

Prices are a little above average, but but worth it.  They only take CASH."}
{"text":"My roommate and I stopped in here right after we moved to the Falls; she said she remembered it from when she was a kid so we decided to take a trip down memory lane for her. 

It is INCREDIBLY small inside and filled to the brim with knick knacks. Decorate how you choose, but it was kind of a pain having things taking up my valuable plate and arm space when folks were already packed in like sardines. 

There was no sign on the door stating that it was cash only (I've been informed that there usually is one), so we didn't see it until I'd ordered a coffee and was handed a menu. No biggie for me, but my roommate did not have any cash and Flurrys does not have an ATM. The waiter directed us to the bank across the street, so my roommate told me to put her order in for her and she'd go take some cash out. 20 minutes later I gave her a call and she told me the ATM was down and she was wandering around in 100 degree heat looking for one that worked. She came back after another 15 minutes dripping sweat, finally able to pay for her meal. If you refuse to take card please have a reliable ATM!

3 stars because the food was actually delicious and our server was super nice."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food.  I love the breakfast quesadilla and the warm chicken spinach salad.  They are meticulous about keeping your coffee filled and hot."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Flury's.  We had banana pancakes, pumpkin pancakes and their regular pancakes. They were all so tasty one was not better than the other!!! You cannot make a bad pancake choice there!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The old Flury's was just around the corner from my house growing up. It brought back a lot of good memories. Get a milkshake they are amazing! Btw they do take credit cards! Can't wait to go back! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  I was looking to try something new in Akron and found this place.  Staff was really nice as well."}
{"text":"This darling cafe has great food and excellent service. I just wish they were open later. With that said i sometimes will plan my day around getting here before closing"}
{"text":"Nice and clean, somewhat cramped though. First time dining experience. I got the country fried steak and eggs. Very disappointed. \"Steak\" reminded me of the cheap veal patties I used to buy in the packets at the grocery store. Not impressed. Sausage gravy was runny , and definitely wasn't a rue based. Needed seasoning. Eggs were cooked ok. I personally don't like the whites/edges crispy -- but that's how I got em. My companion got the pancakes and was pleased overall. 
I do agree with other reviewers for the pricing and/or quality/quantity of food it is a bit over priced. 
People there are nice enough, however I doubt I will return. It just didn't \"wow\" me. Older waitress reeked of ciggs-- and that's a big turn off in my book. 
Go try for yourself-- maybe you will like it!!"}
{"text":"Really great little diner. Atmosphere is nice, scenery is pretty, service is nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I try to come here almost every Saturday. If you go too early, they're really busy so I usually wait until after 1pm. The food is really fresh and homemade and the staff are friendly and helpful. The local coffee is delicious. The decor is quirky and cute, a very homey feel. The only bummer is that they only take cash. All in all, one of my favorite breakfast/lunch places in town!"}
{"text":"Great cornmeal pancakes as the special today. Nice cute place. Two very small rooms so not good for groups. Lots of counter space, though. You can watch them cook. Smallish portions for the price, but not too bad. The food is good and has some non-typical offerings so I'm happy."}
{"text":"This cafe was very disappointing. The portions are very small (all meals are served on a salad plate), the meals overpriced and the service is painfully slow. There was one other diner there and it still took a half hour for our food to come after ordering.  The food wasn't bad, but nothing special either. My veggie omelet was OK, although it must have been made with only two eggs, and came with a small side of potatoes and burnt toast. My husband had the sausage and gravy and biscuit. The single biscuit was the smallest I've ever seen with this dish and there was about two tablespoons of gravy. It included an egg and small side of potatoes, but it looked more like a child's meal and cost $8. He said the meal was bland to OK. My son's chocolate milk (in a small juice-sized cup) was $2.75. I was really excited about this place. The decor is quaint and I thought, given the reviews, it would be one of those tucked-away diners that makes breakfast food right. Sadly, this place is surpassed in every way by the other breakfast places in the area. It's not fair to compare Flury's to the nearby Blue Door Cafe, which uses many high-end, organic and local ingredients, but the prices are almost comparable. I went to the Blue Door the day after Flury's and spent almost the same amount for quicker service and one of the best breakfasts I've ever had."}
{"text":"So great! We were antiquing and needed a bite. Happened into this cute diner and really didn't have any expectations. It was sooooo yummy! Made from scratch salsa on the chorizo quesadilla and delicious chicken salad sandwich. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Flury's has some of the best breakfast that I have ever had. It's got a cozy, small-town atmosphere. Fair prices too."}
{"text":"Small, quaint corner restaurant with a lot of charm. Small counter space with a few tables do not discourage the wait for home style food. Breakfast and brunch are cash only, but so what, it's worth it. Assortment of egg dishes and various pancakes with a nice raspberry ice tea are a highlight. The brunch menu offered their own specialties, but we were only two people so we didn't sample them. Attentive, friendly wait staff made sure your cup is always filled. Quirky fun decor. Not good for large groups. Points for anyone who can identify the error with the New York mirror scene. Check out the local antique stores for some oddities."}
{"text":"The kitchen was VERY slow. It took 30mins to get our meals. The customer came after us got her food first. Don't order orange juice, that's the smallest glass I've ever seen for $2.75/glass. Our food came out greesy. Server was courteous though. Not recommended. Not coming back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Cuyahoga Falls. We take out of town guests here all the time. You can sit in the original room, essentially in the kitchen , or in the newer expansion, both have their own charm. The food is amaaaaaaaazzing. Staff is incredible. I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is really a great place for a nice brunch solo or with a friend. The small diner atmosphere is complemented by the fun decor and great bar seating at the picture window overlooking the Riverwalk. Parking is an easy walk away in the nearby deck.

The Eggs Benedict was great, and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Incredible place for breakfast or lunch . New place seats the same number as the old place did so it is still the same small diner feel .  Fantastic Tuna melt , and always fresh baked cookies . Her move to Front St is a welcome addition to the neighborhood !"}
{"text":"Cool corner diner hip in a quaint sort of way. I had a fluffy omelet cooked perfectly and golden hash browns...yum. Friendly waitress offered me fresh out of the oven ginger snaps, ok taste not worth the money. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a crazy little place.  Small with a strange mix of decor, but the people were super nice and the food was GOOD.  I had the special cornmeal pancakes with blueberries with a side of eggs and bacon,  my boyfriend had the cinnamon French toast with eggs and bacon.  Everything was excellent (and only $25).

We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is a small and eclectic diner on the corner of Front Street. When I say small it probably fits around 20 people at a time. I got Benedict Florentine and found it to be very good. This is a great sffordable place to come with a friend and enjoy a cup of coffee or stop by for a quick lunch during work. This is a great spot and hopefully it will help the front street area."}
{"text":"Flury's is a \"one of a kind\" old school breakfast and lunch diner. Food is fantastic, made with fresh ingredients, from scratch. A real gem for the community."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Flurys we usually wake up extra early to beat the breakfast rush. A true little gem in the Falls. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. The seating is a little snug so it's not the best place to take a \"large\" party, but the perfect spot to meet with an old friend and do brunch. You'll need to hike a little ways once you find a spot, but it's worth it. After you eat you can walk down to the Cuyahoga River and visit the surrounding antique stores. Fun little cafe with an old school vibe. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yum!  This is one of Cuyahoga Falls best kept secrets. So delicious. They have a great menu with an excellent breakfast selection."}
{"text":"This is a very small spot hidden in a residential area, but close to State Rd for easy directions.  The food is pretty simple, but fresh and good.  It's like having a mom cooking for you, which has it's love and comfort satisfying you're every bite.  

Since the place is tiny, it can get cramped especially if you sit at the counter.  Of course, I know this from experience.  Waitresses were squeezing past each other and between patrons...I think it might be more beneficial if they either took out a table and chairs or try expanding the place a bit.  

But overall, this place is something you should check out and enjoy watching a crew of women treat you like family and fill your tummy with solid comfort food."}
{"text":"The new location on East Portage Trai l is comfortable and inviting. We found the service to be good and the food was better than most breakfast spots. We had the blueberry  pancakes and eggs benedict. The  benedict comes with an ovèr easy egg vs the traditional poached.  This was fine but different, but we go looking for creativity.

I recommend this restaurant, will eat there again and plan to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I got the potato pancakes with 2 over easy eggs on the side. The potato pancakes are hash browns with egg mixed in to make it a cake. Their menu says it's gluten free, and I didn't have any issues with them. Good filling breakfast, and the best price i've found on a basic breakfast so far in the area.

The waitress cut up some of their cookies and was offering samples to the customers. The staff is very kind and sociable. I sat at the counter, and we struck up some nice conversation while they made my food. Also, you can't beat free refills on coffee."}
{"text":"This diner has been a hidden in gem in Cuyahoga Falls for a few years now. They started over on Sackett and have grown to a beautiful, intimate breakfast joint . The staff is helpful and friendly, and they make you feel like family. Their menu will surprise you and so will the ingredients! The chorizo is perfect, it starts out a little spicy, and quickly becomes savory. If you stop in for lunch, grab a burger. I'd recommend the single, because it's all you'll need. Try it plain with cheese! The meat is seasoned just enough that you'll appreciate it without any condiments, and to wash it down a chocolate malt."}
{"text":"I've tried eggs benedict all over the country as it is my favorite when eating breakfast out and this place is head and shoulders above the rest.  Delicious!  Coffee is good, they bake cookies and they are great too.  Open for breakfast and lunch until 3pm but breakfast food is served even in the afternoon if you want it.  Service is spectacular, very attentive.  The only problem is it is very small so sometimes you have to wait but it is always worth it!"}
{"text":"So close to home and the office... Flury's Cafe is one of the best gems in Cuyahoga Falls. It's that place you feel at home, even if it's your first time visiting. Everything on the menu is great and they serve breakfast all day... You have to try it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A simple café, with great food and nice service. It is not a fancy place at all. It's a local café. But, the food and service is consistently good. Watch for limited working hours though. Closed after 3 pm and on Sundays."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. 

After I got over my obsession with Blue Door I decided it was finally time to give Flury's a try and I am glad I did. 

Cute place with a decent amount of seating. We haven't had to wait on any of our visits, weekends included. The service can be a bit spotty here. Honestly, I am not sure who our waitress is. We start with one person and end our meal with another. 
The food has always been good and sometimes it fast and sometimes slow, seems to depend on the day. 

The only thing that drives me nuts. Whenever I order french toast a side is not included. However, they ask what you would like, bacon, sausage, etc. as if it's included. Then your check comes and you just paid an extra $2 for a side you didn't really want but ordered because you thought it came with it. That drives me nuts about places and in my opinion is dishonest but now I know for the future."}
{"text":"What an awesome find in the middle of Akron Ohio area!  Just traveling through making our way to Boston and...

Try the French toast it was light and fluffy, just so happened they had fresh strawberry which made it even better. Also my wife had the eggs florentine with spinach and it was also a big hit!  

The place is small, but the food came fast and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try someplace new. Flury's Cafe was a welcome surprise. It is a small Cafe with a limited menu. However, the food is great. I had the chicken fried steak with two eggs, biscuits and gravy and hash Browns. It all tasted great. This and a bottomless cup of coffee was $13. I walked away stuffed.  

One thing to be aware of: when I went there (June 2017), Front St was under construction and is closed. There is no parking at the location  I recommend you take 2nd Street and park in the Riverfront Shops parking lot. Then take the small walkway/alley to front Street. It is a short walk. But there are stairs. 

It is a small Cafe so, as is mentioned in other reviews, it is not a good place for more than 4 people. 

All said and done, I recommend Flury's."}
{"text":"Hidden spot in Cuyahoga Falls. Their new location is great and ideal for grabbing a quick breakfast. Can sometimes be crowded and they only take cash! Worth checking out if your looking for a eclectic diner style atmosphere and good food for a good price!"}
{"text":"We were in town for an early appointment and decided to stop in for some breakfast on the fly and I'm really glad we did. Flury's has a small diner charm about it and taste to back it up.  I ordered the eggs benedict with hash browns and instantly found a new favorite breakfast dish. My wife had the veggie omelet with toast and homemade jam. She loved it. Needless to say if we're in the area again, we'll be stopping back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just recently moved to Cuyahoga Falls last month. We've been intentional about visiting locally-owned businesses and I'm soooooo glad we came across Flury's. Last Saturday, we were in the mood for brunch so I did a quick search via Yelp and came across this gem. I'm not exaggerating when I say that everyone needs a Flury's-type cafe in their town. The employees are beyond friendly, even going out their way to make GREAT recommendations for the best local spots (I made sure to bookmark all of them. Thank you Flury's staff!)

 The food is seriously good! I ordered the stuffed french toast and the boyfriend ordered the chicken and chorizo quesadilla with a side of homemade salsa. Yum! Also, they locally source their coffee from a roaster in nearby Akron. Anyone that knows me, KNOWS I'm a coffee snob and their coffee is good enough for me to actually visit the roaster. 

Ahhh! And the decor! I'm not sure how to explain it besides bright and inviting, just like their staff. Thanks again flury's for the experience. We will be back sooner than soon."}
{"text":"I wonderful little hole in the wall place!!! Such a cute retro vibe. The breakfast menu is huge and the lunch menu has a fun spicy selection and diner classics. Local art on the wall and fun little coffee mugs. I had the Kentucky hot brown with old school wrinkly French fires and house made white French dressing. It was amazing!!! Only open for breakfast and lunch. Come early this place fills up. $-$$. Great for kids with fun little pancakes :) I'm coming back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"For the life of me I can't understand all the rave reviews of this cafe. Is it cute? Yes. Are the people friendly? Very. But the food? Mediocre at best.  My omelet was ok, but the hash browns had absolutely no flavor and the toast was hard and dry. My husband's quesadilla was incredibly small, to the point that it would have been funny if we hadn't just spent $20 for a meal we could have made far better at home. 

The coffee is really good though."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Waited almost an hour for mac n cheese and tuna melts that were small and worse than I can make at home. And the bill was almost $50! So much for one $. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Everytime I come in and have breakfast with my friend Diane we enjoy it, great place to hangout and catch up! Recommend one person in your party arrive early to secure seats.... Place fills up fast daily!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The veggie melt is awesome as are the fries. It's tiny and can get packed but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Weekday breakfast

No line... lots of room bottomless coffee and killer pancakes... had the bacon in the cake rather than on the side... opens at 7 am... great reason to get out of the house early!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading a review from a Blue Door addicts review. This place is simply no comparison to Blue Door except for the wait to get your food. The quality and quantity  of food was really disappointing. Don't mind a wait for food, but it has to ROCK. Won't be making a repeat visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great, inexpensive and traditional breakfast, Flury's is perfect. They have amazing coffee and generous breakfast servings, and you'll be full the rest of the day! For the price points, Flury's is unbeatable. In the summer, I the peach preserve they serve on toast is one of the best things I've ever eaten. So good!! Love this place."}
{"text":"Where do all the local wooly-mammoth intellectuals go for breakfast?  This morning, all seven of them were at Flury's.  I decided after about a half hour, which was how long it took us to get our food served, that I just might as well enjoy the conversation, as this place is just slightly smaller than my own dining room at home.  The bon mots were flying faster than Keirkegaard's Christian existentialism, I can tell you that much!

My potato pancakes were almost teleological in their evolution from grille to plate, reminiscent of G.L. Buffon's Histoire Naturelle: food qua food.

The eggs Benedict?  Perhaps a revisit of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's Jesuitical vision vis a vis revision is in order!

Chocolate chip pancakes, served in the style of Dostoyevsky with just a hint of Gurdjieff, seemed to become of a piece with the worn kitchen, the worn kitchen help and the worn patter of our comrades d'counter.

When, in the final analysis, is a sausage patty NOT, in fact, a sausage patty?  Hmmm.  Herein lies the very core of civilization's breakfast conundrum."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!   I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN !!!!!!!   I ordered chicken salad sandwich but asked for no bread.  I also ordered a soda.  I got the chicken salad on a plate with two small very thin slices of pickle that looked like they had been heated !   Imagine that.   I expected a soda in a glass with ice.  The waitress slapped a CAN of soda in front of me and charged me $2.25 for one can of diet Coke !!!!   I asked if I could have some crackers, she brought me one tiny, and I mean TINY, package if crackers.  My $bill for 1 small scoop of chicken salad and a soda was almost $9.00 !!!!!!!!!!   I will NEVER EVER go there again and they deserve to loose their business operating in this manner."}
{"text":"We dropped in at Flury's today for the first time and it was great.  First, though, in spite of the comments about lack of tables and slow service, we got a seat right away and the service was great.  We did chat with one of the other customers, though, so the part about it being a social place is true.

I like pancakes and they had a section on signature pancakes.  They have a bunch of varieties, including pumpkin and blueberry.  I happen to like both a lot and asked if I could get both in the pancakes and they said no problem.  The pancakes were excellent, as was the sausage that came with them.  My wife also liked her Florentine omelet, and I thought it was good too, even though it was full of vegetables.  I'm definitely going back there."}
{"text":"We selected Flury's based on a 4.5 rating on Yelp. This isn't a 4.5, it's a 5.0. The food ranging from burgers to breakfast to a salad was all outstanding. The service was excellent too. The atmosphere is very casual decorated with old appliances. Flury's will be on the revisit list for our next trip to Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"I go to Flury's quite frequently. I've tried most things on the menu and have loved almost all. The quesadillas are the only thing that I don't love - they are kind of basic.  My favorite breakfast items are the chorizo scramble, pesto tomato omelette, country fried steak. For lunch, I lovee the caprese chicken sandwich - the pesto in it is delicious.  The chicken spinach salad is also delicious and very filling with a homemade dressing. Mac and cheese is good too when I am craving something cheesy. I basically love it all."}
{"text":"Very small. If lot looks busy, come back another day. Inside is cute & very clean. 
Service is slow.
Food is good, but in my opinion, slightly over priced. Maybe that's how they can afford to close so early. 
I would go back, but there are so many more local places that I prefer.
Cash only."}
{"text":"Super quaint place with very attentive service. My cup was always full but without them being annoying. I got the the banana pancakes and while the texture was delicious and fluffy the pancakes were lacking banana flavor. Could have used probably double the slices/purée. Might ask for double banana next time if possible and that would bump this to a 5. Might try other varieties too."}
{"text":"I really like Flury's. You will wait a little longer for your food than at a chain restaurant, but that's because everything is fresh and cooked to order. Its worth the extra time. The eggs florentine are my favorite, and the best vegetarian breakfast in the area in my opinion.  If you are more in the mood for lunch, the Veggie Melt is aweswome. The food is good, the servers are friendly, I've never had a bad experience here. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The wait for our food was ridiculous. We waited an hour, literally. In fact we lost our appetite. The placed was packed, 11am on a Saturday. Can't recall much us about it, not memorable."}
{"text":"We had eaten breakfast here several times, especially for the perfectly done Eggs Benedict.  Finally tried lunch;  the chicken caprese sandwich had slices of freshly grilled chicken - housemade bun and aoili.  A pleasure.   This is a cozy little diner, decorated with local art, and offering wonderful food with friendly service."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to go to this place once I saw it. It was quite tiny and not too promising looking. But I went in anyways and was pleasantly surprised. It has a very cute mom and pop upbeat feel! I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes. And they were hands down the BEST chocolate chip pancakes I've ever had. I definitely will be recommending this place to others and will be bringing people back with me next time. The staff was also very friendly and checked on us multiple times, which was nice. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Flury's!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the primetime brunch hour on a Saturday. I know other yelpers have complained about the wait times, but my party of 2 only had to wait about 15 minutes until we were seated, which is totally understandable on a Saturday morning. They were very nice, and brought us chairs outside, so we were able to take a seat in the shade while waiting. 

Flury's is a tiny little cafe, which seems about 50/50 bar/table seating, so if you've got a party of older folks or people with mobility issues, definitely request a table, cause the barstools are a little high. 

We had a seat at the bar and were quickly served the coffee we ordered. Not sure if it was our close proximity to the coffee station, but they did a great job of keeping your coffee refilled. I ordered the eggs benedict and added jalepeños--SO good! I'd never think to toss jalepeños in with breakfast, but it was amazing. A+. Would do again. They used a really nice thick slab of ham in there, and the housemade hollandaise was phenomenal. The only thing that could have been improved upon was the hashbrowns, which were nothing to write home about, but hey, when you slather them in that gorgeous gooey mess of egg yolk and hollandaise, they were just fine! I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It's pretty good here.  You feel like your at \"grandmas\".   Cute little diner atmosphere w/some vintage items around.

Coffee, eggs over medium, bacon, hash browns all fine.  Nothing outstanding.  

The winner was the country fried steak.  It was yum-o!  

The white toast also stood out.  It's not from your average loaf.  When we inquired if they make it, the server said they get it from Sarah Jane bread company, which makes fresh bread daily down the street.  So that's a plus!"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! I was so mad when they moved locations a bit farther from me. Seating is limited so get there as soon as you can! Food is great, and they're milkshakes are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Neighboorhood cafe, which can be a good thing if done right. This one is not. The decor will confuse you. It has no synergy at all, with a little 50's, 70's, 80's and the very  contemporary. 
I had pancakes and eggs. I have tasted better pancakes and the eggs was bad. It's funny because I just had a conversation with someone yesterday and they said how can someone screw up scrambled eggs, and my comment was it can be done. Here is the perfect example of that. 
I would suggest you try it, if you like supporting independents like I do, but just keep the expectations low."}
{"text":"What a terrific hidden gem! We found Flurry's on a visit to Cuyahoga Falls... just a short walk from the Sheraton. It's small and homespun, with a retro feel. The food was fresh and delicious. A much needed break from the typical fast food that seem to be everywhere. I had chicken salad that was yummy. Friendly service. Will definitely look forward to returning on future visits."}
{"text":"Slow service for such a tiny place. Nevertheless, I always appreciate mom-and-pop joint and its atmosphere. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was decent but nothing worth raving about.

For a family joint, Flury's Cafe is not bad place for morning pancake and good conversation."}
{"text":"There aren't many options for breakfast or even brunch on a Tuesday morning which resulted in my visit. Flury's is cute spot with pleasant customer service. The food was delicious and at a very reasonable cost. I had a egg sandwich with hash browns while my husband had chorizo & eggs with hash browns. Both were fresh and simply good. We need to keep these type of business in business so I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Now this is a Cafe with amazing service and food! there are not many places that can do both, but this place is it. We just moved to the area and this was the first place we tried and was absolutely happy with our selection. The food was amazing and it really doesnt matter what you order from the menu. the coffee was great too, and i dont even like coffee without sugar, but this locally brewed coffee doesnt need it at all.. Def will be coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"This breakfast & lunch spot has limited hours & only takes cash, so plan ahead & bring your appetite with you. This is as close as Cuyahoga Falls gets to a Jersey-style diner, but it's done with simple elegance & none of those gross accents. This is the sort of place where you feel like a regular, even if it's your first time visiting - & you're treated like one, too. Try their breakfast quesadilla or their chorizo scramble. Or anything, really."}
{"text":"This place is small, yet adorable/intimate. Between the two of us, we tried the veggie omelet and the french toast. Everything was delicious. They have homemade jam, and the coffee is amazing! It's cash only, so beware of that. Otherwise, it's definitely our new, favorite diner in the Cuyahoga Falls area."}
{"text":"Love this little gem of a place. The cornmeal pancakes are fantastic, and the homemade cookies are a real treat."}
{"text":"My Husband and I LOVE this place.  Kim, the owner and chef is wonderful.  Seating is limited but is worth the wait.  It remind me of eating around the counter at home.  We have met so many people that we will never meet again, but had a great breakfast with them anyway.  If you like people and interacting with them you will love Flury's."}
{"text":"I had the country fried steak and would recommend it.  It's pretty small in the dining area, so I would not recommend a group larger than 4, even so 4 is pushing it.  Knocked off 1 star for cash only."}
{"text":"Eggs Florentine looks and tastes delicious! Great service and clean atmosphere. Nice place nestled in Cuyahoga Falls"}
{"text":"Went with the family (5 total) and enjoyed the Eggs Florentine plus a fresh cup of coffee. Everyone else tried something different - Quesadilla brkfst, 2 eggs/toast/hashbrowns, pecan pancakes, and an omelette.

Service was pleasant and the food hit the spot for a Monday morning dining.

Note: It seats about 30 or so folks in the diner. There might be a line when  you arrive, but no worries - you can still grab a fresh cup of coffee while you wait.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Flury's for the first time this morning. We are new to the area and love trying and supporting local business. I was excited to try this place, since it had some great reviews. However, it fell a little short for us. First off, it's cash only. That's fine, but the only place they had that advertised was on the inside of the building at one corner. Boyfriend had to walk to an ATM so we could pay. Second, the food. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't great. My eggs and bacon were fine (not that you can really mess that up). The coffee was decent. My pancakes were a bit on the mushy side, but standard for blueberry pancakes. Boyfriend had a rather small chorizo scramble, and his breakfast potatoes were burnt on the outside and mushy on the inside. Overall, I wasn't too impressed. We could have easily made something of the same (if not better) caliber at home."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, and the sausage gravy w/ 2 eggs and hash browns were delicious. It was a little warm in the restaurant today, but at the same time I can't blame them for having the heat on during an abnormally hot February day. The restaurant was clean and the coffee was good!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a cute little diamond in the rough! I am a big fan of breakfast food, and this cafe nails it! They really focus on food made in house right down to their toast, pesto and jam which makes them different and unique. Everyone that works there is really friendly and helps each other out  which is a nice thing for customers to see. This place is pretty small and I don't think that it has much room for large groups but tables of four are definitely available. Order either breakfast or lunch, they are both awesome! Personally, I like to get their toast, eggs with pesto and jalapeños and sausage. Their pancakes are good and the burger is great as well. In my opinion, it is one of the best breakfast places in the area."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is so delicious and it's super affordable!! The country fried stake meal and the Mac n cheese are must tries."}
{"text":"I enjoy Flurry's café it has character is clean and classic; offering good food with a warm smile. The menu is simple yet delicious, the staff is cordial and the service prompt. It's not good for large parties given the size of the establishment, and parking is located in the back or around the corner but not bad. I find this café to be perfect for breakfast and brunch, but haven't had lunch there yet. the only draw back is that it's cash only which can be a bit of an inconvenience."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were viewing a townhouse next door to this cafe. After the viewing, we decided to walk up and down the street to get a feel for the neighborhood. On our way back, we decided to give Flury's a try. My roommate ordered pumpkin pancakes with bacon, and I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Service took a little longer than I would prefer, but it was definitely worth the wait. My eggs benedict was fantastic! My roommate was very pleased with her pumpkin pancakes (even though they didn't have warm syrup like she prefers). The only complaint she had was that her bacon wasn't crispy, but that is probably a personal preference thing. Hopefully we will be moving here soon, and we can enjoy even more food!"}
{"text":"M-Breakfast hit a high note. Stepping back from franchised establishments in the search for a good breakfast has been an exhausting pursuit. This place is landlocked in size and parking but worth the obstacles and wait. This location has held a history of restaurants my first visit was in high school for lunch. A few owners have tried and failed to make this location thrive. I hope this will not soon be the case here. The food was prepared well and the service staff was young and energetic. Cash only is a hassle in the age of plastic and 3% interest charge. But I think even D will find this place pleasant and orthodox."}
{"text":"I'd give it a \"strong three.\"

Went there for breakfast yesterday and the food was good.  Service was an absolute \"5.\"  And, the place seemed really clean.  16 seats in the \"main\" (older) room; 19 more in the adjoining room.  

We'd go back if we were in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love the settings. A diner at its finest. Great food, service. Had more smiling than my belly. It's a must go!!"}
{"text":"They do not accept checks. Only cash. And I hate it but there is no where better in C falls than Flurrys. I tried to fight it but it's so true. Such friendly servers.
Amazing eggs Benedict, great portions(not too much), and they always have fresh desserts. I will be there next week for biz breakfast. Blue door who?"}
{"text":"This quaint little diner/cafe is located in the Cuyahoga Falls Square.  It's a tight space and is very packed on the weekend.  It's standing room only which means a very long wait.  Yes we waited almost over an hour after we ordered to get our breakfast food. But you may ask why the 4 rating then?  The food was good,  especially the chicken fried steak.  The pancakes were really fluffy.  The bacon had a funny taste in my opinion.  I also rated it a 4 because the servers were nice. The breakfast cost a little more than a Denny's or other breakfast spot.  Overall, I would go back based on the food."}
{"text":"Ready to switch up your Saturday morning brunch? Look no further than Flury's Cafe. A true diner in the heart of our new downtown Cuyahoga Falls, Flury's takes you back to simpler times (est. 1968). 
Only seating 38 customers, this cafe is a nice change of pace from other breakfast spots in town. The menu is a nice change as well, which includes simple, old style favorites (no avocado toast here)! The atmosphere is quaint and eclectic, and the service was excellent. It's nice to feel welcomed instead of hurried in and out as fast as possible. Definitely try it! Tip: bring cash...not sure if they accept cards."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Flury's and I have to say, it exceeded every expectation! Fantastic food, cozy atmosphere and excellent service!! 
The blueberry pancakes melt in your mouth, biscuits and gravy were so delicious and cinnamon roll French toast.. phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Little place... we had to sit at the counter, which I didn't find too comfortable. I had the Kentucky Hot brown which I loved. It was a little... like had long strips of bacon and you had to cut it up... but I found this awkward squeezed at the counter and kind of too low... but it was good! with a delicious sauce! I wonder if they are good with sauces. Get something with sauce! Some guys next to us got some breakfasts with sauce on them... looked good! Hubs got a cheeseburger. Smallish, but inexpensive and excellent quality! We got onion rings. They were delicious. This is a pretty righteous place! Do people say righteous? IDK! The bathroom was clean. Where do you park? We ended up getting trapped driving all over the sidewalk. (Not from the area) Great  place! Good prices."}
{"text":"What a great find this diner was! 
The parking is a little difficult, there's a parking garage right around the corner, but the lot closest to the restaurant seems to be always full. Just note that you'll have to use the parking garage and walk a little bit to get to the restaurant itself. 
Inside the cafe/diner is quite small, I would say it could probably only seat about 20-25 people, but even though it was full when I went, I didn't feel like it was stifling or overcrowded. I also loved how there was no greasy diner smell (you know what I'm talking about!) and it seemed to be very clean inside. The decor is quirky, children's drawings and local artisan handicrafts decorate the walls, along with a Garfield clock. 
The service here was astoundingly great for a diner type of restaurant, I never once had to ask for a refill, and they were all too happy to provide the substitutions I requested. I decided to try the eggs benedict with biscuits instead of English muffins, along with one of their coconut pancakes as an a-la-carte option. The eggs benedict was pretty good, it seemed as if they made the sauce themselves, it was a little thinner than you usually find, but just as delicious. The hash browns were super crunchy and the eggs were cooked well. The star was the coconut pancake though, I couldn't believe how delightfully fluffy and soft it was, and it wasn't overly sweet in the slightest, which is typically my complaint about most restaurant pancakes. I'm eager to try all the other pancake flavors on their menu! I found the price to be just slightly higher than an average diner, but for a small cafe, I would say it's pretty standard. I think most of the breakfast platters and entrees were around the $7-$8 mark. 
The only disappointment was the coffee, it was basically stale diner coffee, a little burnt and bitter. It didn't hinder my experience though, and the upside is that they have a variety of other drink options including milkshakes and even kombucha! 
I honestly can't wait to come back here, I've been looking for a breakfast/brunch place somewhat close to home that doesn't have that pretentious feel, and this fits the bill perfectly. I would most definitely recommend this place to others, especially if you are in the immediate area."}
