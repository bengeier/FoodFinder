{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and had the opportunity to experience this delicious establishment. The food was so fresh and yummy. I love the concept of being able to personalize each item to each individual liking. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and accommodating as well. I love that Pittsburgh is bringing in fresh healthy foods and able to keep up with the current trends. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the portions and restaurant in general; crappy plastic bowls and plastic forks. stir-fry was mediocre and i made my own! the juice was great, though. I had the better go red juice (i think that's the name) and it was so refreshing. again, a little overpriced but the juice seemed worth it."}
{"text":"My first time in Pittsburg. This place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! I had a salad and the portion size was perfect. So sad that they do not have one in Kentucky! If I am ever here again I would definitely go back. The food was fresh. My mom got one of the little yogurts with fresh fruit and granola. Also good and simple but fresh. If you are around the area and want a good quick meal, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Wow, really tasty! I got a build your own stir-fry with chicken, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, fried shallots and sesame seeds and the red curry sauce. Absolutely delicious and only slightly, pleasantly spicy."}
{"text":"So happy to find a salad place in Pittsburgh! Their salads are delicious, as are the stir fry options. We just went on their third day open in Pittsburgh. The service was fast and helpful, and they have a great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was only my second time there and the manager Jonathan help me out alot I was extremely grateful for his generosity and attentiveness!!!! Oh yea.the food was  great too!! Such a wide variety helps with my pescatarian lifestyle!!"}
{"text":"Really cool way to order foods! I also like their App, really trendy but also detailed with their products. I had a dine-in at the store, but one of the ordering screens was out which wasn't a big deal.  I waited about 10-15mins to get my food which was a bit long, but the food was really good! I had sesame garlic stir-fry with wheat noodles. I was really impressed by the wheat noodle option and I will definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Great spot to pick up lunch on the go.  Good quality ingredients and large variety of ptions for creating your own stir fry and salad combos.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Definitely my fav in this neighborhood. Healthy and cute. I really hope they could open before 9a haha, so that I get some breakfast on a early class day."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Great menu, great portion sizes for the price, and great ingredients. Everything from the chicken to the mushrooms, even the blue cheese, is local. Honeygrow has a self service style, where you order (customizing your meal) and pay using a screen, then they call your number when your food is ready. Friendly staff, clean, and quick for a healthy meal on the go. Would recommend this spot and would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Good food, easy ordering, great service. 1 star docked for inconsistency - sometimes they forget to put the honey in the honeybowl. Still worth it.. I go here once or twice a week!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get delicious and healthy food worth the money. Honeygrow has the freshest salads and also a variety of options for stirfry. Honeygrow is my go to lunch break restaurant. The staff makes this a five-star place to eat. One time, during my takeout order, the members forgot cheese crisps on one of my favorite salads, the walnut street noodle. I called them just to make them aware in case they had new staff members making the meals for takeout orders. The managers and staff were nothing but friendly and helpful, and offered for me to come back for them (while giving a little extra as well). This place won't disappoint, try their food today!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant was that it served healthy choices in a hipster style - which is exactly what I experienced haha. Somewhere where fitness junkies would stop by after their workouts. And the hipster part was that you order through a touchscreen monitor. You can choose from salads or stir frys. Once you choose your selections, you'll pay, get your receipt, wait for the food to be made in the kitchen and pick it up when your order number is called. Just the interior in itself was clean and minimal. I would say the space isn't that big but there is seating available. I saw a lot of people getting take-out though.   I ordered the White Bean Tuna Salad and my friend ordered the Red Coconut Curry Stir Fry. Compared to the pictures, I thought the salad didn't look or taste as appetizing haha. Just felt like something I could have made at home and the ingredients didn't seem too fresh... maybe it's because we went towards the later time of dinner?? As for the stir fry, you can definitely taste the coconut, which I'm not a big fan of so it was just okay for me. I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong thing...? But the food and experience here was just average. Nothing really \"wow-ed\" me from the hype that it had. I think you'd get bigger portion and quality from Hello Bistro in Oakland.   One thing that was pretty neat was that there was a word search on the back of the napkins, so that was fun to do after finishing our meal :)  Considering coming back to try the more popular dishes and the honeybar."}
{"text":"honeygrow is another fast-casual restaurant where you can customize your dish--either stir fry or salad in this case. If you're looking for a salad, I'd suggest going to hello bistro instead; the ambiance might not be as great, but you have more topping options and get more salad for your money, and it tastes better too. The salads and the stir fry here are pretty good, but I just can't get over the fact that they don't put prices for their non-custom menu items. The most recent time I went, my fall harvest salad was $12 (there wasn't even meat in it), and my friends' stir frys were around $15. Seems a bit steep to me. Three stars because the touch screen is easy and nice for when you want minimal human interaction and the restaurant is very clean and modern."}
{"text":"First time trying honey grow! - little disappointed. PORTIONS WERE SO SMALL! Honestly I was a little horrified to see how little the bowl was filled but happy that I did feel somewhat full even though it felt like I got so little. I got the honey sesame stir fry which came out to a little over nine dollars but it was reallyyyy salty. Probably won't be coming back to be honest but glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"Ordered salad and they sent it with no dressing. Called and they offered only to refund the dressing. I've been out of the state all week and had no food in my house where do they think I have the dressing to cover their mistake? That's why I fucking ordered dressing with my salad. Then after fighting, they only returned 9.00 of my salad, that isn't the price. It was 11.00 because of add ons. Way to treat someone who always orders 20-40$ orders from them all the time. Hope you enjoy your 2$."}
{"text":"This is the best salad in Pittsburgh. The service and ingredients are great. I made my own salad with Spinach and they have everything imaginable as an add in. The service is even better. I came with my mother-in-law and Elena couldn't have been kinder or more helpful. If you're in Pittsburgh and you want a salad, honey grow is the place."}
{"text":"honeygrow is an awesome new addition to the burgh! It's a great lunch spot with pretty speedy turn around! Ordering at the kiosks makes the process quick and efficient and gives the customer total control over how their meal is prepared! I did custom built salad and it was delicious! Unfortunately, it was also $11. I wants to try their fresh juices, but that was another $6, so I had to forgo that choice or it becomes a really pricey lunch!   All in all, I'll definitely be back soon! I love a healthy option that's close by. Just be cautious of parking. It's on S Highland right by Penn Ave so it can be a little tricky. Try to snatch a spot on a nearby side street!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now and first was good with stir fry where they even let me try the sauce before I ordered. The most recent experience not as great... I ordered a to go salad,  yes it was dinner time but it took almost 20 minutes for it to be ready and then I got home and realized half the toppings (nuts, cheese, etc) were not on it... that was a $12 salad with only arugula, chicken and yams.... Im sure they are working out some kinks, overall concept is cool. Pros: healthy farm to table ingredients  Cons: pricey for what you end up getting compared to others in the area"}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup at 7. I got the spicy garlic chicken, wife had the fall salad. We also ordered focaccia and a juice.  There isn't a specific place for online order pickup. I asked the \"cashier\" about my order and she said it wasn't ready.   I watched people come in off the street and place orders and get them before us. I waited till 7pm before asking about our order again. This time the worker simply dismissed me since she hadn't called out any orders. At this point it's been over a half hour since we ordered online. A couple minutes later to her credit she asked me what my order number was, it was done and had been sitting on the back shelf for maybe 10 mins.  She hands it over but forgets the focaccia and drink. I remembered the drink (because it was $6, hard to forget). But I also forgot about the focaccia.   Wife's salad looked awesome though. They forgot onions on mine but it was good, even if a little cold.   I recommend ordering in person, and sticking with the salads."}
{"text":"This is a stir fry sort of place where you walk up to a kiosk screen, pick all your ingredients and pay, and then everything's prepared and brought to you within a few minutes. It's not cheap (a typical bowl will cost you around $10-14), but the ingredients are super fresh and I never felt like the meal was a waste, or too small. I wouldn't eat here all the time for obviou$ reasons, but it's certainly a good option for a night out or a special, fresh meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful flavor and great concept! Alana (sp?) asked us how our food was, and was genuinely interested in our feedback. My bowl didn't seem to have the same amount of food as the other bowls, and she quickly resolved it by getting me more without charging. Unbelievable customer service, tasty food, and we'll be back with the kids again! Thank you Alana!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! First of all the decor is super cute. One thing to note is that seating is a bit limited so if you go at a busy time, be prepared to take it to-go.   You order at touch screens, which I really liked because I had a bit of time to think about/change my order without feeling like I was inconveniencing someone. I made my own stir-fry which was really just a customization on the spicy garlic. Wow -- it was definitely spicy, and I like heat. I would say comparable to a 7 at a thai place.   The portion size was great and everything tasted really fresh. I also really liked the diet pop -- they don't carry pepsi/coke. It's a less common more organic brand -- it had some type of natural sweetener which was not stevia. I was unsure at first but then I ended up really liking the flavor of it.   I didn't have room for the honeybar but I'm dying to try that next time!"}
{"text":"Got to come in today for a tasting preview, they are actually open for business beginning tomorrow (9/8/17).    This is a new place with an awesome, healthy menu! The main foods are salad or stir-fry and each listing can be customized to your liking. They also offer cold- pressed juices and a \"honeybar\" which is a fresh fruit cup with various toppings.   Ordering is done on a large touch screen and your order number is presented on a flip board hanging on the wall. I had a longer wait than expected but I'm certain this will improve with time.  So most importantly, the food was great!! I had the sweet soy five spice, which had brown rice base, green beans, ground turkey, onions and sesame seeds. Ingredients can easily be swapped. It tasted delicious and sooo fresh!  The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable on their menu.  I'm excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fast! You order from a touchscreen and can customize your order however you want. For my first visit, I got the spicy garlic stir fry. Everything was fresh and the portion size was perfect. It only took about 10 minutes for our food to be ready. The staff is super friendly too! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cozy, quiet and uncrowded at 6 on a Saturday, we got the food pretty quickly and I couldn't be happier.   The Red Curry stir fry was delicious and vegan friendly as well. Was filling enough to be a solid dinner and clocks in at only 430 calories.  Looking forward to stopping here more often"}
{"text":"First of all, the second you walk in the servers all greet you and say \"welcome to honeygrow!\" They're inspired by fresh, local ingredients so it adds to the neighborly feel. I loved the walnut st noodle salad, the dressing had a light flavor (which I prefer, but for those who like heavier salad dressings maybe sub it out.) The build your own stir fry was delicious with the sweet soy sauce! We also got a honeybar, which is basically a fruit parfait without the yogurt. That one was a little pricey for what it is, but it's because of the local honey and homemade whipped cream. It was a yummy and healthy sweet treat. There's street parking outside, but I parked in the target parking lot a block away. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Solid selection for a healthy quick meal. Their tuna salad is my go to especially when I'm trying to get some greens in my life. Order ahead for carry out as waits during peak times can sometimes be a bit."}
{"text":"The concept reminds me of Sweetgreen. Compared to it, less flavour mostly due to higher % of leafy greens than other veg. Overall, clean & healthy."}
{"text":"I really like it!  Here's what's good:  - I love the order kiosks. The touch-screen system is easy to navigate. I'm not rushed and I can order my food exactly like I like it.   - The food is delicious.  It's full of flavor. I like the roast pork noodle bowl, but I will try others soon.   - It's a nice little space to hade a seat and enjoy a meal. It's clean and light, if a bit cramped in regard to how the tables are spaced out. But it's kind of a community eating space, so make a friend."}
{"text":"I noticed honeygrow had opened and it took me a while to get there. Glad I did. They make excellent food. Stir fry noodles that you choose the components and flavors you want. It's easy to order- they have a touch screen system, and the food is ready fast!   They have a soda fountain that serves up organic soft drinks flavored with cane sugar. The Mexicola was great!!  I'm glad honeygrow is here and I hope they stay!!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time yesterday! They were busy and were very friendly with everyone. I would have taken a picture of my food, but I ate it too fast. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get healthy food.  The design is clean and minimalist, with a few goodies: 1. The ordering kiosks are awesome! Often, I get the same thing at a restaurant because I don't want to ask a bunch of questions about the menu and possible substitutions. Also, this eliminates the common restaurant sin of cooks touching money, then touching food.   2. The message board that lets you know when your order is done has a soothing retro noise and the letter and numbers shuffle.   The first time I went here, I was craving a salad. I didn't want the pitiful portion size at panera and I also didn't want to get carried away and make a $20 salad at whole foods. I was able to customize the salad to my liking and was shocked at how big it was. For $9, I had a meal and a snack for later.   The second time I came here, I got the red curry tofu noodles. It was very good, but not as spicy as I would have liked. I finished the whole serving in one sitting, but was uncomfortably full afterward. I also tried the fruit cup (strawberries, bananas, and grapes with chocolate chips, clover honey, and whipped cream. The fruit cup was tasty, but for $6, I would have been better off buying the mixed berry cup at whole foods down the street.   This is a yummy spot if you have a couple dollars and are looking for nutritionally dense foods."}
{"text":"SO HAPPY THEY CAME TO PGH! The food is so tasty, healthy, and service is quick. I love that you can have a savory meal and something sweet all under one roof. I love that they suggest ingredients to put together with their specialty bowls or you can create your own. I will definitely be frequenting this place more often!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see \"honeygrow\" has finally made it to Pittsburgh! With delicious stir fry, salads, and fruit desserts on the menu, this unique quick serve restaurant is a welcome change to the usual Chipolte lunch. Ordering is fast and simple: either in store via touchscreen or in advance via app (although the honeygrow Android app is abysmal and hardly usuable). Although I take my food to go, there is very little room in this location for dining, if that is your preference. Meals average $12-$15 with beverage."}
{"text":"I'd recommend you try noodlehead (lower price point/higher quality) or chipotle (similar price point) instead."}
{"text":"Honeygrow is my go to place when I don't feel like cooking dinner, but want a home cooked meal.  I've been here more a few times and the staff is always really friendly. I've only ordered stir fry, and love the freshness of the ingredients! You can order a stir fry from the menu ($7.99 - $10.99), or customize your entree's ingredients.  This is my favorite way to order.   My favorite stir fry has egg white noodles with the red coconut curry sauce and a kitchen sink of veggies with chicken.  Please note that the price can really climb if you go too crazy!....The portion size is perfect for dinner. You won't be disappointed with your yummy bowl of tastiness, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The MOST delicious food, and fast service! Inside is cute and updated. Parking in that area is generally not awesome but it's worth it.  It's unfortunate that healthy food options cost what they do; you'd think it would be cheaper to eat healthier if they wanted to combat obesity ?. One meal with a few add-ins and OF COURSE a honey bowl runs you about $20. I wish it were a little cheaper, but I still love it!"}
{"text":"I am so grateful to have Honeygrow in Pittsburgh- They have made having a quick, HEALTHY dinner  possible for me and my husband.  The produce is fresh, the place is very clean and the staff is AWESOME! Elena and the entire staff welcome every customer as they enter and thank them for coming as they go-  Just so friendly and professional!  The only negative is that parking can be a little tough but it is TOTALLY worth driving around a few times for a space."}
{"text":"Came here today for dinner after hearing good things. It took me a minute to figure out how it all worked. You order from a touch screen - which I actually loved! The system is also super easy to use. You can even log in and it saves your orders.   As a vegetarian, I loved the customization options. I also like all the different noodles. I tried their spicy tofu with the spicy garlic sauce and whole wheat noodles. It was definitely spicy - I went through 3 drinks while eating! But it was also delicious. The portion was plentiful and the quality of the veggies was really good. I knocked one star off because the quality of eh tofu wasn't great. Had pretty good flavor, but it was super spongy. I expected more from a place like this.   Service was also good, impressive especially considering how new they are. I look forward to coming back and trying something new."}
{"text":"If this is the future of fast food-I'm 100% in. A healthy and quick option that is always tasty. It's a bonus that the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"I came to honeygrow on a Sunday- and it was a steady flow of people. I didn't know what to expect because I had heard mixed things about the dc location. I ordered a bowl with rice noodles and veggies and tofu. I got the brown spicy garlic sauce on the side. It was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to honeygrow. I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon cause I was craving a hearty and healthy salad and I got it! I liked the way you went in and ordered off of a touch screen. It was easy to navigate the menu and customize the salad if you needed. Everyone was friendly and I definitely want to go back and try their bowls and other menu items.   Also, I accidentally made the mistake and ordered a second kind of cheese on my salad. The employees asked me if I wanted both and gave me double of the same cheese since I paid extra. I thought it was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. I got the red curry with tofu the first time, which was very good. The second time, I got the tuna white bean salad. Was very underwhelming, and dressing was sparse so it was pretty bland. My partner got the pork bowl, which was way too oily and he said the broccoli was super undercooked.   Maybe it was an off night. Service was quick and staff were nice. Would go back for noodles and avoid the overpriced salads."}
{"text":"My son had a decent meal so we decided to go back.  I didn't even get to taste the food because the service was so bad. I tried to call in an order and was told to \"use the app\" because the counter person was too busy with the \"lunch rush.\" Except is was 1:50 pm on a Saturday!  App was hard to find on the site.  Would it kill you to put it on the pull down menu?  We'll try again, but service matters!"}
{"text":"Not good. Bad experience   Food is average. Won't ever go back again"}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible delivery. My order is 45 minutes late and the driver has gone to the farthest locations to deliver when I live only a two minute drive from this location. My food is cold and I am very frustrated/disappointed"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try honeygrow because healthy, quick-service restaurants are pretty rare in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food on both tries.   I first got a build your own noodle bowl. This lacked flavor and I had to add a combination of sauces to try to revive it.  The salad was okay, but nothing I'd order again.   Although they charge to add individual ingredients, they skimp on quantity. I opted to add a few extra things but could barely find them. Also, they charge almost $2 to add a hard boiled egg and I wasn't even sure an en entire egg made it in.   While I love the idea of this place, I think it's far too expensive for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Just getting into Honeygrow for many reasons. but a definite newfound fan of the product and service. A great nearby and healthy food option. Kudos to the Sunday evening crew for talking me through my first experience. Will definitely be a frequent customer"}
{"text":"This place was good. Not fantastic, not earth shattering but... they are getting a five star rating and I'll explain why. Their employees have the patience of a saint. Or a god... not sure but it felt like a super power. All over this damn restaurant you had oblivious idiots roaming around like brain dead zombies on their phones. Sitting, standing, shuffling... all completely checked out of life. Meanwhile the employees were killing themselves to prepare all the orders coming at them non stop from in store and pickup online orders. When completing an order, the employees were then calling out the numbers over and over and over again INCESSANTLY!!!  The zombie like customers couldn't even remove their brains from their phone for 2 seconds to acknowledge their order number and pick it up!!  It was horrifying. I watched three separate incidents where the manager had to yell the number at least 7 or 8 times before these morons realized \"oh maybe that's my food order?\"  It was shocking how calm the employees stayed while repeating themselves like a broken record. I couldn't have done that... no way. And that is why I'll go to this place again...just to show that there are a few of us left still present and coherent in day to day life"}
{"text":"Always busy and worth the wait! I love the made to order touch screen and being able to see your food prepared. The watermelon and beet cold pressed juice is also amazing."}
{"text":"Avocado should not be brown.  There is no ranch dressing or anything creamy.  It is difficult to get help when using their kiosks.  The shrimp are minuscule and taste like sulfites.  Croutons were soggy."}
{"text":"Some days are ice cream days, some days are vegetable days. Today was a veggie kinda day, so I stopped by honeygrow for lunch. What a great place if you're looking for a healthier meal option! The ordering process is super simple using self-serve kiosks at the front. Honeygrow has salads, stir-fries, and fruit bowls that you can customize however your little heart desires. I opted to build my own stir-fry with wheat noodles, chicken, and a boatload of veggies in a sesame garlic sauce. Note that only 3 veggie add-in options are included, and beyond that you have to pay extra (which can add up quick....although today I didn't care and went for the veggie overload!)  My food was ready in about 5 minutes, and I was a happy camper. The portion was very generous, and they didn't skimp on any of the add-ins. I loved the sesame garlic sauce...it had great flavor and it wasn't too oily, which stir-fry sauces can sometimes be. Everything tasted very fresh, and I love that they use locally sourced ingredients where they can. It is kinda pricey (especially if you add a bunch of stuff in like I did), but I was happy with the quality, so it doesn't seem too excessive. I'll definitely be back next time I need a veggie day!"}
{"text":"Salad was filling. Staff was very friendly. Ingredients were fresh. My modified order was accurate. Would come back."}
{"text":"Honeygrow is a great concept that Pittsburgh needs! Ordering at the kiosks really streamlines the process and allows guests to build their meal or snack exactly the way that they want.   I ordered from the honeybar: yogurt, dried cranberries, blueberries, granola, and gingersnaps topped with clover honey. Absolutely delicious!  The little eclectic touches also make honeygrow charming--such as the ever-changing message board and the wordsearch napkins."}
{"text":"We made a trip down to Honeygrow this weekend to see what it was all about. At this point, I wish they were everywhere.  I had the Sesame Garlic Beef and subbed the noodles for brown rice and of course added just about every other addition that I could to it. It was awesome. The beef was tender, seasoned perfectly. Then sauce from the stir fry permeated the rice, and merrier together well with the sesame seeds and the cashews which I added to it. The downside is they initially made my order with chicken and had to remake it. I'd have still ate it with chicken.   She had the Spicy Garlic Chicken and it was spicy. We ended up trading meals about half way through and I ate the Spicy Garlic Chicken and it made my nose run. That's rare for me to say. It was hot, but damn was it good.  While I personally didn't try any of the local honey and granola options, she did. I sampled it and it was refreshing. Very fresh ingredients.  I was a big fan of the sugar cane fountain drinks, definitely different and some pretty unique flavors.   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A new addition to East Liberty!  It's a cute space, open floor plan, bright and inviting.  No doubt, the interior is nice.  However, something was missing from the food that made my experience just okay.  I ordered the \"Make it Grain\" salad.  I wasn't a fan of their honey ginger vinaigrette? because it left a strange aftertaste?."}
{"text":"Finally tried Honeygrow. If you have not tried it, it's in the new trend of fast, \"locally sourced\" real food, like Chipotle, Choolaah Indian BBQ or Piada in Oakland. I'm sure they would not like to be grouped together, but to me they are basically all the same; quicker versions of \"ethic\" food. They also have the customizable order component. Ordering at Honeygrow is done via a kiosk, where you pick your protein, veggies, add-ins and sauce, etc. They do have a few pre-made meals on the menu as well. I tried the rice noodles with chicken, some veggies and the tahini sauce, on the side. (I didn't like it so I ended up asking for a side of the sesame garlic.) The BF got the brown rice with pork, veggies and the sesame garlic sauce. I like the BFs brown rice better than mine, but that was my fault; I'm funny with noodles. And as I said, I didn't really like the tahini sauce, but I got it on the side, so it wasn't a problem. He didn't realize you could choose lite, heavy, etc. sauce, and the amount they used was a little too much for him, but he liked it otherwise.   The overall verdict? It was ok. The pros are lots of options- by changing your protein, rice/noodle, sauce- there is something new to try. Plus, if you want to watch what you're eating, you can really control things like sauce and add-ins. And if you're looking for a fast dinner/lunch, its quicker than sitting in a drive thru half the time. The cons? It's just so-so. We will be back but it isn't like I'm dreaming of the place. If you want real Chinese/Thai/Asian cuisine, this is not it, but if you are looking for a decent, quick, semi-healthy grab-n-go meal, it's a great option."}
{"text":"Staff is SO friendly, I was checked in on once I received my food to ask how the new menu item was. I had the Tahini bowl and it is very nice! Quick service with good food, nothing but great things to say about this place. I also love to get the honey fruit bowls here as well when I have a sweet tooth. My secret is I come here before I grocery shop so I don't but everything because I'm shopping on an empty stomach!   Super clean, fast food with quality!"}
{"text":"WOW. I'm loving all these additions to East Liberty area. First time at Honeygrow, and it definitely won't be my last!!  My experience: 11/10 The restaurant is welcoming and clean. It offers limited seating but has an open feel to it especially with the large windows. On the day we went, it was a clear day so it was nice to have the natural light and view of the cathedral across the street. It has a self-order system with 4 large screens that are easy to navigate through HG's 3 main menu options: salads, stir-fry, and honey bar. They really nailed the user experience. When picking the salad, the name overlapped pictures of each salad so you can get a better idea. Once finished, you receive a ticket # and help yourself to a seat. Didn't wait too long. Midway through lunch, an employee came to check on how we were doing. Later, another employee came by with free samples of 2 of their juices and their winter kale salad.   Food: 10/10 My friend ordered the sweet soy five spice stir fry which she enjoyed. I ordered the Make it Grain salad. Portions are huge; flavor was fantastic and tasted fresh for only ~$8. We tried the honeybar (~$5-$7), opting for the medium honey (they have 3 types: dark, medium, light) and toppings such as bananas, blueberries, granola, and chocolate chips. It's basically a cup full of fruit and toppings with honey drizzled in between. They don't skimp on the toppings, so you're paying a decent price for what you're getting. There could have been more honey or possibly an option to choose how much you'd like it in (just a thought!)"}
{"text":"Such a fan. It's a rather new \"chain\" but don't let that word fool you, this place delivers quality food that makes you forget it's a chain. You have a basic choice of salads, stir fry, juice (good juice) and honey granola fruit bowls. I have never had a bad meal here. At work, this is a once a week stop for the office. You can build your own salads or stir fry's, OR you can choose to have one they have built for you. Either way, you won't be let down. This restaurant went from 13 to 26 shops within a year. They doubled in growth and there's a reason for it."}
{"text":"Honeygrow is sweet like honey. So good. So convenient.   I order ahead on my app for a quick pickup and it's always ready when I get there.  I go the customizable salad route every time. Some may think my order is strange, but that's the beauty of a place like honeygrow. You can add whatever you like, and create any sort of wild combination to satisfy your every craving.   I love the wide variety toppings. I especially love the fact that they are ALWAYS fresh.    Little pricey depending on what you add-on... but somehow I don't seem to mind."}
{"text":"Overall, my experience here has been great! The staff has also greeted me upon entering, their menu ordering is fairly simple to use, and I've enjoyed everything I've gotten there!   My only complaint (besides the horrible parking which isn't their fault!) is that the menu is not kid friendly! I have a toddler and there's really nothing available on their menu that works for a typical toddler palate. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here, but if I am, it's not well advertised. Because of this, we rarely go now unless it's sans toddler. If they had kid friendly options, we'd be there a lot more! Please consider adding this to your menu or advertising it better!"}
{"text":"Today I visited HoneyGrow for the very first time and man was I blow away. We ordered two different stir fry options. The rice, with green beans and turkey was absolutely delicious. The turkey meat was well seasoned and the sauce was absolutely delicious. Our second was the noodles with tofu but we also added chicken and shrimp. Foremost, I do not like tofu and I know my boyfriend has not eaten it at all and we loved every bite of it. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Love!!  Everyone in my office loves this place - we order from honeygrow at least once a week.  First time I got the sesame garlic stir fry - not spicy, but delicious - lots of fresh veg and meat.  I got the spicy garlic next and it is spicy (maybe a Thai 5 or 6) - but the pineapple cools it off and it is yummy.  Just be careful if you aren't into spicy.  Best thing on the menu is the honey bar - it is a full meal by itself!  Packed with fresh fruit - make sure to get the whipped cream!!!!"}
{"text":"Liked this place for healthier fast food.   For a vegan, at least you can have a good look/read through what is available and make choices for a totally custom dish or modify other offerings.   Fast, fresh & good portion sizes.   My DH is mostly vegan but will have butter from time to time and had a thai style dish, I created my own salad - of course.   Both good & filling. They have TOFU.   Staff at the time we visited was VERY upbeat & the place was clean. If I am in a rush and in that area I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh but combine into flavorless piles of large hunks of various ingredients. This is true for both the salads and noodle dishes. At least the design of the restaurant is done well, wish I could say the same about their product."}
{"text":"I lived a few blocks from this place for the past year and I am so sorry this is my first time there. My mom came into town to visit and we decided to do a quick target run for some things for my apartment. When I asked her she was hungry she goes, \"I could really just go for something fresh, maybe fruit.\" It was the perfect opportunity to try honeygrow. My mom absolutely loved using the screens to select her options. She opted for the honeybowl and loved choosing different fruit and even the type of honey she wanted on the bowl. She was beyond thrilled.  I opted for the salad and it was so good. It was fresh and perfect for what I was looking for. I worked at an orchard for 10 years and tend to be picky about my fruits and vegetables and this place nailed it. Even the prices were reasonable. I may have created a bad thing by going here once because I may be back weekly. Correction, I may be back daily. No shame here."}
{"text":"I've been excited to give honeygrow a try! I selected the red curry tofu noodle bowl - it was slightly disappointing as it wasn't packed with as much flavor as I imagined it to be and the portion wasn't as large as I feel it should be for $10. That being said, I loved the location and the ordering kiosks. The interior is cool and minimal and I enjoyed being there. I love the idea of a quick, healthy (vegetarian) option so I will definitely give honeygrow another try - maybe next time with a salad and a treat from the honey bar."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here (about 10 times now) my food is consistently spot on. I give 4 stars because there's always an issue with seating (dirty tables, employees taking up whole tables while it's busy, and just a general lack of design when it comes to fitting in enough useful seating to begin with). I'd say just anticipate that you may not be able to sit inside so you're not disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice clean place with really good food! Not bland at all, and the portions are decent. The staff are also courteous and food comes fast. Yum!"}
{"text":"I returned here to try out their menu having taken a brochure home with me on their menu. The place is very small and takeout is available. There's even an app if you want to order in advance and then take out. Outdoor seating is available.  This is the first Pittsburgh location. Their menu consists of two different offerings, which is either a stir-fry or a salad. Along with those you can order a honey bar and special juices. Everything they have is farm sourced and there is a board telling you where all the farms they use to supply their food.  Each item is listed with a calorie count but no where does it lists prices. You can build your own stir-fry or salad. Certain things are extra. Some of those are noted on the menu.  You place your order on a tablet. The tablet asks if you want to supply your phone number if you want to become a regular or \"track\" your order or just order without it. You then make your selection, it will ask you if you want to substitute anything out and you \"build\" your meal from there. The same is true with the honey bar. That consists of your choice of 3 different fruits to choose from, two toppings, and your choice of honey. Yogurt is extra. Also on the menu is herbed focaccia for an extra charge. You will be given a number and you can pay with either cash or credit card.  I sought out help from the owner since this type of menu was way too confusing for me. I was able to order the spicy garlic chicken stir-fry and then swap out the spicy sauce for a non-spicy one. I was also able to swap out the noodles for rice at no additional charge. Likewise I ordered a honey bar with strawberries, bananas, and blueberries, made with wildflower honey and topped with chocolate chips and granola.  If not purchasing bottled water they sell presweetened beverages from a machine made with cane sugar. Once they called my number I was able to pay and was given my meal on a metal tray.  The owner was nice enough to clean my table for me and sat down to a good and indeed filling meal. There was plenty of rice in my stir-fry and chicken cooked to order along with the other vegetables it came with. My honey bar was perfect as it was. Without the yogurt it had just the right amount of sweetness and wasn't overfilling. You can opt for maple syrup instead of honey if that isn't your bag.  This place is indeed a welcome addition to the city to serve local and farm sourced foods. I did tell the owner that it would be helpful to get the prices available before looking at that tablet because it can be confusing and it will add up. Every menu item is priced differently so you won't know until you see it on the tablet how much you are spending. Expect to pay anywhere between $11-$20.00 depending upon what you get. The honey bar by itself is $5.95 plus tax. It is not too big but definitely worthwhile.  The special juices as well run anywhere between $5.00-$6.00 on an average. They are open every day so I would suggest go on a Sunday when parking in East Liberty is free."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick Honey Bar treat. Because this was my first visit I had a few questions. The Caucasian woman behind the counter who was also preparing salads and fruit cups, sounded bothered by the three inquiries. I noticed I placed the order at the kiosk twice so I deleted the extra order. The system didn't print a receipt. As I was called up two bowls were waiting. After being questioned about the order one bowl was removed from the bag. No biggie as I didn't need or plan to pay for two. The bowl was covered with yogurt. So much so that my bag was icky. The price point alone should be an indication of the level of quality one should expect. After wipping off the bowl and cleaning my sticky hands, I was able to finally enjoy my evening snack.  May consider coming again"}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams \"Quality\". The store is beautiful. It's decorated in a way that is both classic and modern.  The staff is friendly and fast.  The menu is easy to understand.  The food is heavenly."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times, food is good. Nice, healthy selection, clean environment and friendly staff.  Takes waaay too long for a fast casual restaurant. You need to set aside 15 minutes just to get your food, not counting if you have to wait in line.  Also, on the expensive side. Least expensive option is going to run ~$9. Scale up from there if any extras or different proteins.  If I'm going to pay that much and have to wait that long I'll go to one of the sit-down restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that a honeygrow location opened up in Pittsburgh. I love the concept of healthy food that's both quick and completely customizable. However, honeygrow didn't quite live up to the hype.  The ordering system is through a computer so it limits any employee-customer interaction. I like the idea but in practice, it made the process more confusing and time consuming - not to mention 2 of the 4 computers kept freezing up.   They offer different menu options but you can also build your own salad or stir-fry. I built my own salad with tofu ($2 extra) which comes with 3 add-ins and 2 toppings. The variety of dressings could have been better. The pre-fried tofu was almost inedible. Aside from being cold and bland, it was so tough that it became a jaw workout. Other than the tofu fail, the rest of the salad was great, and the portion sizes were surprisingly large.   Overall, honeygrow did not wow me. It wasn't fantastic but it also wasn't bad. I would stop in again if I didn't have any other healthy options around."}
{"text":"Staff was kind and very service oriented. The menu selection was wonderful. They had delicious, healthy options. The ordering process was very simple to use and you can modify any of the menu items to suit your diet/tastes. The decor/design was simple and pleasing.  Also, was filled up from my healthy meal! Had enough to save for later honestly.  Mega thumbs up for this spot!"}
{"text":"Live not far from here so came down to try it out! It is amazing!!!! The staff was great! Ordering was a breeze and the red coconut curry was incredible!!  And the honey bar.. 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"Eat fresh. Eat local. Eat healthy. All great goals for 2018. And honeygrow checks all the boxes. Basically a sleek fast-casual, farm-to-table joint. Located in the ever changing and gentrifing East Liberty, this new spot offers diners unmatched customization via kiosk (or mobile app) of MTO stir fry, salads, fruit cups (aka honeybars) and cold-pressed juices. I appreciate the level of detail that went into the touch screen menu, which made meal customization more transparent and easy to accomplish. However, less tech savvy folks may find themselves a bit overwhelmed and the overall user experience cumbersome -- if one of the kiosks is down, it can take awhile to order during peak times. Nonetheless, the wait time during this visit was reasonable. More importantly, the food was delicious! Fresh, quality ingredients simply taste better. Your palate will thank you, but your wallet may not depending on how custom you made your meal. I was also delighted to see non-Coke/non-Pepsi products available at the fountain...Maine Root FTW! The sleek, minimalistic interior design was open, bright and inviting though a little more seating wouldn't be a bad idea. And a friendly staff is always a welcome change. Lots to love at hg, so I look forward to future meals here!"}
