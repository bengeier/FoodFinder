{"text":"The staff is very welcoming and have taken the time to get to know my regular order and to greet me with a smile every time. This location is very spacious and comfortable. I recommend this place over any other coffee shop on 17th ave.


As an update to Laura B. And Arc P's previous reviews... the meeting rooms are no longer available for renting as they're being rented out by a local small business full time."}
{"text":"I can't handle going to another 'Bucky's! Waves is the answer. The coffee and tea is very aromatic, and tastes almost 'spicy'. I absolutely love it, but it is a takeout/sit down so don't expect to find a drive thru window :)"}
{"text":"I had wonderful service at this location! The barista(o?) was prompt and attentive and made my order very quickly.  He asked each clarifying question calmly and listened carefully to my answers (would you like whip cream? what kind of chocolate?).  I ordered one item with soy milk and it was not a problem, nor was I feeling unsure if he had heard me or remembered.  He took care to repeat the order back to confirm.  He also was very pleasant to talk to. and of course, both my orders turned out great! I left with a big smile! I would definitely recommend this Waves location to friends!"}
{"text":"Great spot for meeting with lots of space and lots of free parking. I prefer their beans to Starbucks. Friendly staff. Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"After the stampede parade, we went in to grab a cool drink. Not only was the drink delicious, but the staff were amazing and helpful with my little boy. They went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places when I need a place to crash and work on the laptop, or have a quick get-together with teammates to discuss stuff.

I love the fact that this place is open early and closes late.  It's so hard to find a place that's open past 10 p.m. where you can just lounge around (or even grab a quick bite to eat, outside of a fast food joint), so I find this location very convenient.

Another favourite part for me is that they have ample wall outlets so if you need to plug something in (like a cell phone or a laptop), the likelihood of finding a place to do so is high.

They have free wi-fi here, although you'll need to ask the barista for the password.  The bathrooms are protected by a passcode, so you'll also have to ask for the key if you need to use the facilities.

Water and glasses are available outside the counter for those who are really thirsty, which is convenient.

When the weather's nice, there's plenty of outdoor seating, and they even have a couple of outdoor heaters that can be fired up if needed.

I have to say that I'm a fan of their breakfast wrap as it's reasonably priced and somewhat filling.  My favourite drink is the Rooibos Shaken Ice Tea with a splash of Peach or Mango flavouring.  The pastries are kind of on the high side though, in my opinion.

I like that I can spend 2-3 hours here and *not* feel like I'm loitering.  While I'm sure the staff keep an eye on the place, I don't normally feel feel like I'm being stalked.  The managers are very friendly as well.  I've seen acts of kindness by staff members to customers that I'm sure would get them in trouble at other establishments where they're more strict about those sorts of things, when makes me feel like they really care about their customers here.

All in all, this is one place you'll probably find me on a semi-regular basis if I need a place to get some work done outside of work or home as the atmosphere is friendly and laptop friendly."}
{"text":"Love the coffee here... But for Pete's sake turn on the heat.. One hour after opening and we still need our coats on to sit inside"}
{"text":"Great cappuccino...fruity strong beans ... Just the way it should be. Fantastic open space with lots of room to stretch out. And they have a $2 matcha latte special on right now. Great neighborhood haunt."}
{"text":"Best frappé I've ever had! Keith is a superstar! They also validate parking for this parking lot! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have cancer, so walking around a ton is exhausting right now. Walking into Waves was like walking into a friend's place. The decor is unassuming and unpretentious, but the service is absolutely fabulous. I was greeted warmly and genuinely, and asked if I wanted anything to eat with my cappuccino! I declined but the coffee was wonderful, made and delivered with a smile. Sipping it reminded me of sipping cappuccinos in cafés in Germany this summer and those kids KNOW cappuccinos."}
{"text":"great place to have a coffee, love the seating as well outdoor and indoor.
best part is its open 24 hours , which is good for coffee lovers like me hehe..
staff is great here absolutely love the latte here."}
{"text":"Oh Yelp, how I've missed you...

...er, right. Reviewing the coffee house. Not getting all sentimental over a social website. Got it!

I frequent this place for food and beverages. A lot. Be it with my friends, or on my own to work, I come here about 3 to 5 times a week normally (which I realize is probably more than I should). But, there's a few reasons I keep coming back.

One of those reasons, is the food. While it's far from gourmet, it's still pretty tasty. The Roast Chicken Wrap is my favorite for lunch (or a quick supper if I've got a lot of work to do), and if I'm willing to become a temporary diabetic, the Cinnamon Bun is massively delicious! (No, really, it's huge. You probably want to drag a friend down to consume it with you).

Another reason is the staff & service. These folks are super friendly, good sense of humor, and they will attempt to memorize your 'usual' if you visit this particular location often enough. They even occasionally will bring your food to your table (I can't say if this is a standard practice or not, as it seems to strongly depend on how busy they are).

As for the beverage side of things, I have no complaints, just compliments! Drinks are never 'rushed' (which to me, is a good thing), and maintain an excellent level of consistency (the flavor doesn't change every time you order your favorite, which I really can't say for a few other places). I personally like my iced (dark) mocha, frappes and smoothies, but my friends love the lattes and hot chocolate sold here.

And I feel like I'm beginning to ramble, so let's see if I can shorten this a bit...

Other perks to this fabulous little coffee house:
-Upbeat & warm atmosphere
-Fun, clean decor (lots of blue, as you can imagine)
-Unique artwork that changes periodically
-Open early, close late (used to be 24 hour I believe)
-Outdoor seating, for those few precious days of summer we get
-Bookable meeting room (for all you business savvy folk), separated from main room by a glass wall & doors
-Just steps away from my home (this one likely won't apply to you =P)

And I believe that's it...

OH! One thing I will note, is that when it gets busy, it can be a wee bit crowded, and a touch noisy. However, this doesn't bother me much, and allows Waves to keep it's 5 star rating from me.

Hope you folks enjoy it here as much as I do.

Be well, and much love! =)"}
{"text":"I got the blackberry zest soda and I can't tell you how good it was! it was amazing, I was honestly blown away!!! SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS SODA WHAT THE HECK and I loved how sweet the service was and it was comfy and nice"}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee shops and location! This jewel of a place located on 17th Avenue has the feels. It makes you feel like you're in a warm atmosphere no matter what time or day you go in. The staff are very friendly and the place is kept up to standard clean. The pastries I find are always fairly fresh and the drink quality is very good. This is my go-to place to sit with friends and family or even to just grab a coffee and go. It is usually very busy especially on Fridays and the weekends."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite coffee shops in town! The atmosphere is always so warm and inviting, especially during the winter. 

It's a nice place to get together with friends or simply sit down and study or read a book! I really love their selection of drinks and pastries - all at a fair price for the freshness and quality. 

My personal favourite drink is the Matcha Green Tea Latte paired with the Lemon Loaf pastry. This would be my go-to coffee shop any day. It's located in an area distanced away from local traffic. Inside you can enjoy looking at painting that are also for sale but are changed frequently. Very beautiful and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really fancy for a coffee house. It's got chandeliers!
 I was here to meet fellow yelper Wanda B for coffee. I have to say that the coffee is quite delicious.
The servers were also very friendly and efficient.
Important to note there is a meeting room (with a projection screen) in the back that may hold about 20 people."}
{"text":"I've walked by Waves so many times on 17th Ave that I thought it was finally time to stop in and check it out.  Inside has plenty of comfortable seating and tables, there even seems to be a conference room type area in the back and some space outside for tables (for whenever spring starts, I guess!). 

The gal who served me was pleasant enough, but I sort of felt like I was bothering her with my questions.  While I was sitting there, another gal came on shift after her who appeared to be much more pleasant and helpful to the customers, greeting them as they entered and such.  I ended up ordering a dark roast coffee with a slice of banana bread, which was quite tasty.  The coffee was pretty standard, I'll probably try a latte or something more exciting on a future visit.  The display case was filled with many different food options (sandwiches, treats, etc.), but as someone else had mentioned they are a little on the pricier side.

There is free wi-fi available, which is always a draw for me to coffee shops.  I enjoy being able to get some work done in relaxing environments, such as this place.  The music isn't overwhelming and it didn't get too busy the afternoon I was there, so the distractions were minimal.  I believe right now the hours are 6am - 12am, which is handy for the late night coffee crowd.  They also have a frequently updated Facebook page, which is great for keeping up to date with events going on inside the cafe.  

So, Waves is a nice little stop by on 17th Ave and if summer ever arrives, will be popular with patio seating for the cruising crowd."}
{"text":"Excelent coffee and setting place. I love thoer coffee Canadaino. Real coffee tast. Chi latte is also good."}
{"text":"Coffee is great, but you are limited to only 2 sizes! Also, it can be quite expensive for a coffee! Overall, the ambience is nice and good coffee."}
{"text":"Staff are moderately friendly, drinks are good. A little pricy. Not an ideal place to relax or study since the cafe is often full with students from the surrounding schools. However, they offer a free upgrade from regular to Waves size drinks on Waves Wednesday... that's what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Waves has an outstanding atmosphere. From the moment you walk in the light blue color of the interior reminds me of water, which reminds me of sun and  beaches and this makes me smile! I like the fact that the shop is littered with music concert posters, hooray for Duran Duran and Aretha Franklin, respect!

I ordered a medium dark roast coffee and a toffee pudding square. The coffee was good, but the square was just too sweet for me. It was also a hefty $4.99, which seems high for a square. Next time I think I will try one of the delicious-to-the-eyes-sponge-type cakes displayed in the window as well as a latte or another specialty coffee to see how it compares.

Found the place really clean and the staff very friendly. They even said \"see ya\" as I was leaving. 

Waves also has a meeting room at the back of the shop that is encased in glass with a boardroom style table inside. Very nice touch!

Though Waves has WiFi, I had trouble connecting to the network. Kind of disappointed about that.

Giving my experience a 3.5 stars rating with possibility to upgrade to a 4 or 5 based on my next visit.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Quick service. I love me coffee and the strong roast blend really hot the spot. Great to have a comfy seat and good wifi. A good selection of pastries and snacks at fair prices. I was very happy Yelp pointed me in the direction of this oasis."}
{"text":"I went to the Waves in the plus 15 area by the calgary stock exchange.

You really wanna pass yourself off as a good coffee house and youre missing one thing...Good coffee.

Amateur at best, bitter, I might even venture as far as to say WORSE than a Starbucks coffee.... OK no, I apologize, not that bad but  i still tossed the coffee in the trash about 5 sips in. Custard filled sweet bun was dry, flavorless,

 NO LOVE."}
{"text":"This is the closest Waves to my apartment so I frequent it quite often. Service is alright, coffee is decent, food is what you'd expect from a chain coffee place. Frozen somewhere else and thawed instore to serve. My biggest beef lately is that they seem to go through staff at a ridiculously speedy pace. They've either fired the staff or the people quit cause of poor management. I've worked behind the counter of a busy coffee place before, so I know what they are going through. Also, if I were the manager, I'd make sure the staff had a above average of the english language, as it's counter productive to order a coffee and have the clerk ask their co worker in another language what I'm wanting to order. Other than that, I'm here almost daily. Free wifi, chill music, and a bright space is a reason to come back."}
{"text":"The use a large amount of fresh coffee to make only one cup, which is really tasty, the owner actually showed us what they do, very friendly owner which makes me keep coming back"}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop but no parking.  Westpark Parking will tag you for 45.00 parking penalty if you go over the 10 minute limit so be aware!  First time I've received a parking ticket in the burbs!"}
{"text":"Good food. But whenever I ask for a coffee it tastes burnt. Only go there to get tea when I need to."}
{"text":"Great service, one smooth latte! Need one of these near Sunridge, you'd have my money every day."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Free wifi, great atmosphere, and a staff that remembers what you order, no matter how infrequent your visits are. Great coffee and a great selection of food!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here.  One of my favorite coffee shops in the city. Staff is amazing and remembers me when I come in and always has my large coffee ready when I get to the counter. Can be a busy place so seating can be at a premium, and only one outlet to plug laptops into (seriously, my only beef with this place, hope the owner sees this and adds some more extension cords), but other than that, it gets top marks in my books."}
{"text":"I was hungry and needed coffee quick.  My daughter and I popped in here.  I heard great things, but wasn't madly in love with it like I expected I would be.  

I ordered a decaf(had to go home and nap for work after) white chocolate mocha and it didn't taste as yummy as I expected.  I'm not a coffee snob so maybe it's considered great amongst them, but I kind of felt ripped off.  It was bland.  

For food I got the breakfast burrito which I did love!  They heated it up for me, but the middle was still a bit cold.  However, I devoured it so fast that I barely noticed.  

My daughter got a milk chocolate hot chocolate which was yummy.  She loved it and I tasted it.  It was good.  She got the tuna wrap and liked it, but found it had a lot of tuna and would have liked more veggies in it.  She did enjoy it tho.  

I found them to be a bit pricey.  I would go back, but it would be more likely on a rare occasion treat situation."}
{"text":"Updating my rating to 5 YELP STARS!

Because it is NOW OPEN 24 hours!!!!!!!! FINALLY a place in this city where I can go satisfy my random 3am coffee cravings!

WIN!"}
{"text":"My gluten-free Lemon Loaf had mold on the bottom and didn't even realize it until I saw that my fingers were black n thought \"why tf are my fingers black?\" Pulled it out of the bag and flipped it over, and lo and behold. See pic for evidence. The barista asked \"did you want a refund?\" NO SHIT SHERLOCK! I should have gotten a full refund even for my tea also! Disgusting."}
{"text":"Worst coffee shop ever. This company is absolutely shameless. Wish the building would lease to somebody else. Food is an absolute rip off and its pretty much crap. Taste terrible. Never spending another dime in this place."}
{"text":"Solid double espresso.  Correctly served Italian style (short).  Just a hint of bitterness and good crema.

Did not try any food items."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I recently switched to working remote, and I've been looking for a lovely coffee shop to start my mornings off and work for a few hours. I tried a coffee shop a few blocks away first, but they did not have WiFi. Then, I stumbled into Waves Coffee, and I'm obsessed. The baristas are very friendly, and there's lots of room to spread out. I enjoy the music as it reminds me of what we played at my old office, and it makes me a little less homesick. Definitely try the Maple Macchiato."}
{"text":"Over priced and artificial. Ordered a caramel macchiato with almond milk. All I could taste was the almond milk and the nasty taste of artificial caramel sweetener syrup that they use. It did not taste good. 5$ for a hot almond milk with artificial sweetener that doesn't taste like caramel.  At least use really caramel and perhaps more coffee instead of almond milk if you're going to charge that much."}
{"text":"The reason i go hear every day is because of the friendliest and greatest customer service and the atmosphere. Free Smiles, free wi-fi and lots of great tasty choices on the menu. The staff are the best of the best of the best of the best. They always have a way to make your stay a memorable one. I love this place and its people. I would recommend it to everyone .... Again thanks to all the staff for the great customer service! We love you too :)"}
{"text":"I am reviewing the Springborough Location only, and I am not sure why all the reviews are being jumbled under this location. I have long ago boycotted all local StarSucks coffeeshops as I am tired of getting dishwater, poorly brewed espresso drinks there. While my preference is to go to independents who truly know how to brew a good latte or cappuccino, but,  there were none nearby, so Waves it was.

I was pleasantly surprised by my special of the month ($2 latte, September). It had a bold coffee flavour (without having to add an extra espresso shot), and was topped with full-bodied foam complete with latte art, just like those the knowledgeable baristas at the boutique coffee shops make. I have not had their regular coffee, but my extremely picky husband has, and seems to enjoy it very much. The atmosphere is welcoming and not at all pretentious. We were there one friday night and there was even a musician. There is a good selection of pastries, muffins and sandwich/wrap type food, though I would prefer more freshly prepared items. For that, I will leave room for improvement."}
{"text":"Ever since living in Vancouver I have been a fan of Waves.  The dark mocha is the best.  Real Bernard Callebaut chocolate, no syrup.  

The staff at all locations is friendly and the 17th Ave location near 10th street has a great selection of pastries and torte.  It's probably the closest to European torte.

Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Nothing is worse than wasting potential and that is exactly what is happening at the Waves Coffee House on 17th Ave SW (which has no listing on Yelp?).

Located in a spacious area on the ground floor of a building at the corner of an intersection, they have a head start already.

Walking in, the decor is nice and modern. Plenty of comfy chairs, tables and yes even free Wi-Fi. 

The problems started when I ordered a medium roast coffee. I was informed it would take six minutes (a new pot being brewed I assumed). Well'p a total of 15 minutes had passed then I had to ask  for the coffee again- the server/barista/coffee distribution manager forgot about me. If it was busy, fine, but there were five people in the whole place including the employees.

The coffe itself was fairly mediocre, but at just under $2 for a medium, the price was right.

While there are certainly pluses to this coffee house, there are also minuses. For a coffe house, everything seemed to be more of a hassle than it should have been right down to having to put a code in to get onto the bathroom. 

Considering the amount of coffe locations that have sprouted up on 17th, this place needs to try harder at not just go through the motions."}
{"text":"I just stopped in to check the place out and I was greeted right away with friendly smiles. The barista's are polite and highly knowledgable about the menu and pointed me in the right direction of what I would like. Man was she right the \"canadiano\" was the perfect cup of coffee for breakfast. I love this place and I will most definitely be adding this to my morning routine. Very clean and organized and they play original music. I will be recommending this to friends and family"}
{"text":"This place used to be listed everywhere as \"open 24hr\" and had an \"open 24hr\" sign, but was actually closing at midnight or whenever they felt like it. They seem to have changed this information and I want to give them a good review for that."}
{"text":"The Springborough location is best for sitting and chatting with friends, not studying or working. Reasonable number of sockets to charge your laptop, but wifi is not spectacular and sometimes unreliable. The cafe has lots of seating space inside but limited parking. They also have a bitcoin machine. Great find for suburbia and rich kids from Ambrose."}
{"text":"Waves coffee is a really cool cafe where you can have meetings, hangout with friends, or even study. The staff is friendly and the coffee and food that they have is pretty good. 

I was surprised to find out that Waves was a chain because that's not the vibe you get from the decorations, furniture and size."}
{"text":"Number 1 sign I knew I would like this coffee shop: there was no sectioned off area for kids to play in (unlike another coffee shop I frequent in my neighbourhood that may rhyme with Hood Worth).  I like my coffee with crossword puzzles, novels, and adult conversation. 

My fiance, Jason,  and I had a couple of hours to kill, so we decided to step out of the rain. This location is busy, but quiet. He ordered a caramel machiatto and I ordered the Waves Latte.  For the record, Jason is a huge fan of  another-corporation-that-rhymes-with-Tar-Mucks' caramel machiatto. Now that he has tried Waves, he has converted and scours neighbourhoods looking for the closest one.

I really like this location because it's clean, it's in a trendy part of town, and people watching is fabulous. The staff is super friendly and I like the added touch of the leafs drawn into my foam. they also have a meeting room that you can book for $25/hour. 

We now make a point of making this our meeting spot when we need to meet people downtown. And Jason makes a point of ordering two machiattos to tide him over till his next fix.

So obviously, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I always make a point to stop by Waves if I'm on 17th.

Waves offers a nice mix-up from the classic Starbucks addiction that I have. Their selection of drinks is generally larger than most coffee shops and it doesn't impact their speed of service. The baked goods also look quite delicious although I have never indulged in them. I imagine the paninis they offer would also be quite delicious.

The staff are also quite nice and friendly. They keep the place very clean, including the bathrooms (they're locked so remember to grab the key first).

For now I'll just stick to my iced Canadiano's."}
{"text":"Another coffee shop, offering the usual selection.

This location tends to be really empty during the times I've been there, so I always receive good service. I like the art they have on sale here (although I would never pay that much for it). Overall nothing too special about this location, just another coffee shop.

Waves, a different chain, the same usual coffee shop."}
{"text":"A great find in Springbank Hill. Great coffee, food, and ambience! The staff were warm and friendly, and were good about helping us figure out where we should park in order to not get ticketed/towed. The only thing is it's two hour parking (it's free, but only two hours) which is a pain if you're using Waves Coffee as a study space rather than conversation space.

I really liked their London Fog, and their breakfast sandwich was surprisingly unique--egg, english muffin, smoked salmon, and cream cheese. It's quite good. I also shared a cinammon bun with my comrade. 

Overall, a good experience. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Headed to Waves' Springborough location yesterday for the first time and had a great experience.  I went with a colleague and we spent the morning there working while we drank coffee and shared a cinnamon bun.  The coffee was good, cinnamon bun was delicious, and the atmosphere was great!  There are plenty of seats (including lots of soft armchairs), lots of windows to let the sun shine in, free wi-fi, and just a generally good vibe.  In fact we were so productive that I think our boss should pay for us to work there every week since we got so much done!"}
{"text":"5 stars for being such great hosts to a couple of meetings I helped organize in their board room AND for the attention they always give to their clients.

Great service and great coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Oh yes, a coffee shop with a relaxing atmosphere.  Very modern and clean, always a huge plus for me. 

It's not a busy shop, so the service is quick.  Very friendly staff as well, smiling at everyone who comes in.

Even though it was not baked in-house, the chocolate zucchini muffin was large, and quite good. Great breakfast options available to most people who have a sweet tooth.

Here is my reason for just the four stars instead of five: I have requested for a soy au lait, and was asked if I would like medium roast or a dark roast. This is a great question that I wish most other coffee shops would ask their patrons. I have asked what their dark roast for the day is, they gave me a blank look and told me it was a dark roast. Then I asked what their medium roast was for the day, they had told me it was just a medium roast. Then the barista asked me quickly before I could ask anymore questions myself about the coffees if I preferred a misto instead. I said no, an au lait was fine.  

I was fairly surprised the baristas were not knowledgeable of the coffees they have available. However, it may be management that had not trained properly, or not know themselves.

Overall, I would return again when I'm in the area now that I am aware of what I should and should not order. Their chocolate zucchini muffin would be enough of a reason to return.."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of waves when it first opened, but the quality and service have slid a lot since then. Waves is a franchise, and from what i have gathered, they are under mentorship for the first few months of operation- where they are trained on the franchise standards for drinks etc. During that time i really liked waves, slightly better prices than other similar shops, and a decent cappuccino. 

However, lately they have slipped- a lot! My friend has even had to actually instruct the barista how to steam milk properly, and how to hold the spoon over the pot to control the amount of foam that goes into the cup, you know, so you can tell the difference between a latte and a cappuccino.... Pretty basic barista stuff, but they seem to forget it every time we returned... Coupled with awkward vibe from the owner/staff, we have chosen not to go back.

Too bad though, because the location and the layout were pretty great, but there are lots of alternatives that don't involve having to watch the manager yell at his staff in front of a full coffee shop over spilt milk- literally..."}
{"text":"solid 3.5 stars as it attracts a business crowd being in the Pallister building.  tall, tall glass ceilings and great view.

parking limited in front.

free coffee if u buy an entree.

spacious for sure."}
{"text":"They had me at Hello.  After a meeting one evening I wanted to go for a walk and seek out a coffee shop.  Waves was on my radar.  It was snowing big billowy type snowflakes outside so by the time I arrived and walked in I must have looked like the abominable snow-woman.  I was immediately greeted with a Hello.  Even with a blizzard outside this place was busy.

Since I filled up with snacks earlier I wasn't hungry, just looking for a hit of espresso in a cappuccino form before making what would probably be a long slow drive home.  I did take note they had a nice selection of baked goods & sandwiches in the display counter and offered free WIFI.

The customer service blew me away and the coffee is definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Coffee:  I pretty much exclusively drink decaf Americanos, and here they  are decent and typically priced.  Comparing to other local chain establishments, I'll say Waves is better than Starbucks, though I still slightly prefer the coffee at Good Earth and Second Cup (though all four are totally fine).

Food: Haven't tried anything yet.  It all seems slightly overpriced, and none of it really appeals (plus, there are numerous eating options within a block or two).  Most curious to me is a dish that is nothing more than a dozen blueberries and raspberries tucked into a crumpet, selling for $6!  By my estimate that's a markup of like 1000%.

Space:  Spacious with plenty of seating.  Very comfortable, and definitely higher-end in terms of finishing and furnishing.  Good attention to detail and cleanliness.

Vibe: Almost always busy, with a mix of laptop/study types and social types.  Generally your basic young, urban 17th Ave scene.

Productivity Potential: In spite of being busy, it's not too loud.  The music is kept at a reasonable level.  The Wifi is free and decent, seating is comfortable, and I feel like I tend to get a lot done here when I come to work.

Misc: This place has a private meeting room in the back that can be reserved for group use.  I'm not quite sure how that works, and I've never seen it used, but the room does look nice and functional (like a small boardroom), and I'm adding a half star to my rating just for this.

Bottom line: Not the best for food and coffee, but certainly adequate, and other factors make up for any shortcomings here.  Overall, probably my favorite cafe on 17th."}
{"text":"This is the newest instalment of the Waves Coffee chain in Calgary.  I still don't quite get the business model, but having it in this building sure makes it convenient!

They just recently changed management and it looks to be going in the right direction!  Free Wifi, lots of interesting coffee toppings (Macadamia, Coconut, Chocolate, the list goes on!)

It's rarely very busy, so you can get your coffee and read a free newspaper fairly easily, and it's quiet enough to hear yourself think!

I like it!"}
{"text":"This place makes a pretty good mocha latte, but for a lactose intolerant, it sucks not being able to get it in soy. Good selection of pastries and other baked goods at this location compared to the waves on 5th Street. And this location has ample free parking. Much bigger seating space and selection. On the last several visits it looks like a lot of people call this their work nest. (free wifi is always good). Waves is not as crowded as other coffee places, and the music is not blaring so it's the perfect place to catch up with friends or get to know a new friend over coffee. 

This location also features a cool glass board room in the back for office meetings but I also spotted a karaoke contraption and mics. Yunno, cause I'm Asian and I always have my karaoke radar on."}
{"text":"Waking up to spend a long day at the hospital is always difficult. So glad that there was a waves nearby to perk me up. 

The barista was the sweetest girl ever. She was very accommodating to my half awake mind today. She was happy to load up a card for me so that I could join their loyalty program. 

I ordered a white chocolate Matcha. She made it quickly and it was delicious! Perfectly steamed. 

This location is super clean. And it appears to be an uber comfortable spot to settle down for a day to do some work on a laptop or to have a chat over coffee with a friend. 

Would highly recommend coming to this location if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this new coffee shop that had opened on 17th called Waves. Other friends have told me that it's a chain out of Vancouver. I figured \"new Canadian chain? Cool. Worth checking out.\" And so I did.

On a service note, I had no problems here. The staff/owners are all very friendly and asked every customer that came in while I was there a question about themselves or where they worked. Two thumbs up there guys.

The selection of teas and coffees wasn't amazing, but it wasn't that bad either. I stuck to a cinnamon roiboos tea and enjoyed my cup by the wannabe fire place.

Where Waves fell down was with their internet. It's free to use, but is spotty at best. Two thumbs down as a place to hang out for a drink with your laptop in tow.

I'm with Devon B in the opinion that this Waves location is wasting their potential. But they're new here... so maybe they'll hit it yet?"}
{"text":"ok service little over priced but usually quiet and clean"}
{"text":"24 hrs a day you can get a coffee or whatevers.

Too bright!  lol
Music too loud! haha.

OK enough of my old lady ranting."}
{"text":"Best coffee and best belgian hot chocolate .waves is canadian company and it is really good brand.they have great drink and selection of food."}
{"text":"Nice to have another option on the West Side besides the usual suspects. Although most businesses gear to grab and go in the area, this one makes it easy to sit and work, chat or surf. I like that. 
Nothing spectacular about the menu or drinks but there are choices, prices are fair and this is recommended if you want to be able to stay a while."}
{"text":"I had a regular latte and mixed berry scone. The latte was delicious! The scone was enormous but a bit too sweet. The cafe itself has a ton of seating and is not too loud. I will say, though, that it gets really hot inside, but hopefully the patio opens up soon! This place definitely gets packed in the evenings so I would say if you're looking for a quiet place to work it's best to come in the mornings or afternoons. They are also open quite late and the staff are super friendly! This is definitely my favourite Waves location in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I like waves! To me, it's like that middle ground between shishi coffee and normal coffee. They offer a higher value product a little cheaper than higher value price, it's a rather appealing idea!

The space here is wonderful! Big, open lots of seating! This is my kind of coffee shop and I look very forward to the next time I come here! Come try it out!!

{"text":"Owner is super friendly. Amazing Caramel Macchiato and the nicest environment of any coffee shop I've been to in the NE. They do host quite a few business events in the conference room so there's people coming and going all the time but never feels to busy. 

Double check the hours there a little strange sometimes."}
{"text":"A girl walks into a coffee shop in need of an extra large green tea, a seriously strong double shot of espresso, and 2 large coconut waters... because she has the BIGGEST hangover in Canada!!! 

From the moment i walked in, I felt better - the atmosphere is inviting, the tables are widely spaced creating an airy feel (too many coffee shops feel cramped and uncomfortable). The phenomenal and truly fabulous barista had me laughing. The tea selection is wonderful and my tea was perfectly steeped. The espresso was lovely, and thank you Waves for having coconut water. Seriously, regular water will just not do when you have a Stampede sized hangover!! 

This is my new fave go-to coffee house on 17th!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much my goto place for caffeine on 17th Ave SW.  Comfy chairs, nice atmosphere, music not too loud, great wifi connection and fairly decent coffee.

One of many Waves, I find this particularly to be especially welcoming... and open fairly late.  The selection of teas and coffees are pretty unusual, and easily on par with the myriad choices that the larger Starbucks would carry, but in a Canadian run business.  I'm especially a fan of the maple beverages when in season, and their stampede breakfasts are pretty darn good (usually coffee and a breakfast sandwich!).  

The only thing I really have any problems with this one is that the most comfy chairs are also the ones closest to the doors.  That perfectly find in the summer, but in the dead in winter???  Brrrrr.....  

So let's recap. The place is clean, welcoming, warm and wifi connected.  The coffee is decent and there's a good selection of sandwiches and desserts.  Overall, just a nice place to relax and take a few minutes to recoup and regenerate.

{"text":"Good coffee... Not recommended for lunch, unless you have no choice... The location is very convenient, as there is nothing else close, without going out, or walking a little bit... This place is good, for a quick coffee..."}
{"text":"So I've had the attention span of a gnat these days, and I find it really hard to concentrate on actually getting anything done while at home. So I was in desperate need for a close coffee shop that I can park my butt for a few hours and actually get some work done. 

I tried the Starbucks a few times but its always so full and actually kind of cold, and the Buffalo Wild Wings Chicken place which surprisingly has Wi-Fi but lets face it they sell beers and have the hockey game on so aint nothing getting done. 

And then I found it. Its like angels open the clouds and a light shone on the Waves Coffee House. 

So this is the weirdest building. Anyone in the area knows that this building has been everything under the sun. It was a once a discount movie theater and then turned into a church. 

Since then it looks like its been split up. There is some kind of University of Calgary nursing, teaching office. And the Waves Coffee house. One of the coolest features is the high ceilings like I said it was once a movie theater so it has high ceilings and they totally went with it. They have these two giant hanging crystal chandeliers like things. Another really unique thing is they have a board room. You can rent it out for parties, meetings and such. 

The food is good, snacky like deserts and sandwiches. The coffee is good, I think. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I really cant say to much about all that. 

But really its the staff that really completes it. They are just so nice, they seem like they remember me so that makes me smile."}
{"text":"One of my go-to coffee shops, especially in the summer as I enjoy sitting out on the patio. It's usually quite busy inside and noisy so I rarely sit inside the shop. 

The drinks are good, they have a fair selection of pastries & snacks and the staff are always extremely friendly and polite. I love getting their cinnamon buns, macchiatos and cappuccinos!"}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the multi cultures of people.   Different back grounds and languages.  Always nice to showcase how truly Canadian we are with all the culture. Thanks for being so great and even though James b thinks it's not a good thing that use have a high turn over its great to keep giving people opportunities in life :). Great place"}
{"text":"When I came into town, I was happy to see a Waves!  Unlike Vancouver, Calgary doesn't have a Starbucks every other block.  And Waves is kind of a Vancouver thing.  

Walking around, the only other places around here with wi-fi to just sit and chill out is McD's and Starbucks.  

This Wave's also has a boardroom for use.  There are only a few Wave's location in Vancouver with a Boardroom, and it's nice to see that if you're in Calgary and need a boardroom, good ol' Waves here has it!

Coffee's alright and free wi-fi.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate ever. I've been looking for somewhere to replace Starbucks for me and this.is.it. They asked me white, dark or milk but the girl agreed to half and half. AMAZINGGGG. I eat semi-sweet chocolate chips from the bag because I think half and half is the perfect chocolate blend. 

I also ordered a plain bagel. It was fine. Nothing over the moon (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). But seriously - just come warm up with the hot chocolate."}
