{"text":"Wonderful place!  One of the last of the really good Pittsburgh neighborhood bars, in an authentic old 19th century tavern/inn building with the owners living upstairs.  Plenty of free off-street parking, and easy to reach from just about everywhere - at the top of the hill on Steuben if coming from the West End.  Food is great and reasonably priced, with daily specials of both food and drink.  Plus karaoke every Friday night (starts at 9 pm) and live music with local bands and NO COVER every Saturday.  Absolutely NOT a headbanger or \"country bar\"; this is a neighborhood place.  Closed Sundays (the owners have to take a break sometime) and over the week prior to Labor Day.  Smoking permitted, come as you are.  Great mix of people.  Opens at 3 pm but most people arrive late during Happy Hour or after 7 pm."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and food.  The prices are just right for drinks and food. Highly recommended. Friday is karaoke night and wing specials on Saturday.  They have specials everyday but Sunday."}
{"text":"When you just want a good place to sit down, enjoy a bite and a drink...This is your place. Definitely a hole in the wall kinda place in a good way. Nice staff, good wings...also have lots of different entertainment throughout the month. Just a good simple neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"The Obey House is awesome!  Great food, great atmosphere, great fun!"}
{"text":"What are the chances that my friend is right? She has been pleading with me to to come to this place for the longest time so, I caved. I'm so very very very glad I gave in. 

We head on over and pull into a sea of parked cars. That's really the only way to describe it because it's truly a mess that looks like a bunch of drunk folks attempted to park and rolled on into the bar. 

When I first walked in, I noticed there were a few empty seats at the bar which is where I thought we would be sitting. My friend motioned me to keep following which led us into a crowd of folks cheering on the brave soul at the karaoke mic. We found a nice spot and watched the stellar performances which were hilarious. I LOVED IT! There was some really good conversation had by all. The patrons and servers were soooo friendly. I thought it was pretty cool that a couple folks went out of their way to introduce themselves and invite me back again too. 

I felt the hunger coming on and didn't want to turn into Madea so we ordered some mild wings with blue cheese and celery. They were very good and they cook them right (no breading here and crisped up just right) because I hate a wet willy wing. Lol 

Now, I need to share my dislikes: 

Smoke...my clothes still reek and ohhh, my lungs but what to do? There weren't enough servers to manage the crowd. We did wait a while to place our food order  and the wait for our bill was a long one. I mention these things to give you the best description of my experience as a real Yelper."}
{"text":"The ultimate dive bar, crowd looks rough but everybody there is quite friendly. A bar just as you come in and a bar/restaurant on the back. On Fridays they have karaoke, some of the worst singing I've ever heard, but that itself makes this place unique. The staff are all friendly and accommodating to newcomers."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a BBQ chicken salad & a long island here. The salad was huge and I was only able to finish 1/4 of it.. not kidding you. 

The menu was a nice size & had many different options. The bar itself is very laid back & full of regulars. 

The front is more of a dive bar & in the back they have multiple dining tables as well as a giant screen for playing wii & karaoke 

When I went on Tuesday, there was a special for around $6-- hot or sweet sausage sandwich with chips. A patron next to me ordered it and it was a nice size. They have karaoke on Saturdays! I'll have to head back soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely Adore Obey House. I was raised in mostly small towns, and this place totally has a VFW or Elk/Eagles club vibe to it. The drinks are very cheap, the food is great, the service is awesome, and for a dive bar it's very clean. 

The only reason for the 1 star deduction is that they really need to upgrade their ventilation system. I've never been here when it was super packed, but just a few smokers and it feels like you're being hot boxed by the Marlboro man.

So if you can't handle cigarettes, then I would recommend coming on a slow day, but if that doesn't bother you than the Obey Tavern is the place to be."}
{"text":"The Karaoke here is great, the drinks are cheap, and it's just a fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"FAN!

I don't live in Pittsburgh, but I frequent it for work. The last time I was up there everyone said, \"where do you want to go for happy hour?\" and while asking the out-of-towner may not be the best idea, i used Yelp and found Obey House. Other than the name (which is an inside joke between me and another friend) I thought it was a perfect dive bar in the best location from my office. Turns out I was absolutely right.

Don't be scared by the \"I might die in here\" exterior. Obey House is really homey and comfortable inside. Their food is awesome and extremely well-priced. I think it was a Wednesday when we were there and it was $0.75 Taco Night. I have never had a better taco from a north-of-the-border establishment.

The service is excellent. All of the bartenders are wonderful and nice. They're fast and, most importantly, cheap. I hear that it doesn't get too crowded in there so when our group of ~15 showed up we immediately took over the bar. And what's better than having a neighborhood bar full of all the people you know?

Inside there are two areas - a bar area and (I think) a seating area. There's karaoke & open mic nights, a big screen tv, and lots of other things to pass the time. There are jello shots and jello pudding shots for like $1 a piece! Did I mention the $0.75 tacos?

I really really like this place and I'll probably be back next time I'm up in PIT."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! I'm from NYC by way of South Carolina and I found this bar to be very charming in a redneck kinda way. Decent prices, fun crowd and good music. However, I have to take two (yes, two) stars off due to the smoke. A total health hazard. Just coming in after learning my father has emphysema made it too real. They need to get some vents, better fans and open some windows."}
