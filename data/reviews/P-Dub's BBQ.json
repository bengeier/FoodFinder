{"text":"The food is alright, but the service was bad. The owner didn't take his headphones off. When he did momentarily remove his headphones to hear what we were asking he put them back on. It wasn't until the next customer that he took his headphones off to be personable. Just felt rude and I we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have went to this place a few times to try different items. First how can you have chitlins inside the mall with not smell and there not cut up. I try other items like the neckbones. They were bland. No seasoning.  I try the rice and beans No seasoning."}
{"text":"Food is ok... not phenomenal. I watched them overcharge the girl in front of me $2, then when she checked them on it, they pulled some slick stuff and shorted her on her change. Then they overcharged ME $2, and when I pointed it out to her, she says, oh, I'll give you another piece of chicken. YOU ALREADY CHARGED US FOR ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN. Then she refused to refund it and gave us a tiny drumstick.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The smell is what brought me here.. I'am from out of town an surely wish there was one where I live. Absoutly amazing.. Served By P-Dub himself. Thankyou"}
{"text":"I've been eating at P Dubs since he was located on Sahara/Sloan.... I LOVE the oxtails!!! And the vegetables are always seasoned and FULL of flavor ( NOT salty) When Maria makes your plate, its like being served at home ( no skimpy portions) GREAT people GREAT food.... ESPECIALLY being located in a food court of the Boulevard Mall Love This Place, when I dont feel like cookin'!"}
{"text":"Ignor where this business is located.  Yes, it's in the \"food court\" of the newly renovated Boulevard Mall ... Ignor all of that.  One bite of P-Dup's BBQ will transport you back to a lazy Saturday afternoon under a shadetree along a river bank in Mississippi.  Let your tastebuds dance all over a HUGH bellpepper stuffed with the perfect balance of ground beef, rice and vegetables slow cooked to perfection, baked beans with just enough hot to remind you that the South knows how to turn up the heat, and sweet potatos so perfectly complimented that you have no need for dessert.  Grap this to go and skip the screaming kids at the Mall; but don't miss P-Dub's Mississippi BBQ and Soul Food !!! You will thank me later!"}
