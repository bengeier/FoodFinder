{"text":"OMG wow I just have to update my review.
I popped in here last week for some barfi & other yummy treats & couldn't believe my eyes. I stopped in here earlier this year & the place was undergoing some kind of a renovation. Well, people who have not dined in in the past because of what the restaurant looked like before the renovation are in for a shocking surprise! I have got to stop & eat here soon & stay & dine in - the renovations they have done are most impressive!  I just love east indian food and have tried other restaurants around town and this is the one I keep going back to. This is the only east Indian restaurant I trust in Calgary as I know the menu & have never had a single bad piece of food ever - good quality & always reliable & trusted food. 
I've been to the fancy restaurants in town that claim to serve east indian food but the food is awful.
I've never had bad food from this place - the butter chicken, jasmine rice, naan bread, jelabi, samosa, all the other little indian desserts! Yummy!!!!
I will always keep going back here - the food is great every single time!
I've been here lots!
The people are always very nice and excellent prices!"}
{"text":"Really what's up with all these good reviews for this place? If anyone was to see the kitchen at this restaurant they would puke right there and just how bad can customer service get in a restaurant? Well you'll find out when you go to this restaurant. Okay food is not that great because it's old, place is not clean, not a good place to dine in it's dirty and very small gets crowded really fast, staff is always yelling at each other (trust me it's not always about the order I can understand what they are saying) and they really do not care about the customers anymore. If you really want good Indian food for cheap try Apna Desi Meat shop (Take out only), if you want to dine in at a nice Indian restaurant with awesome food and exceptional customer service try Taste of India (Creekside Plaza NW) and for good Indian sweets try Lovely Sweets and restaurant."}
{"text":"We're not sticklers for ambiance and decor (we frequent this amazing Pakistani place that has no ambiance to speak of, but offers the best South Asian food we've had so far). Bombay Sweet House looked clean enough to make us comfortable.

I have good and bad news about this place though. We ordered chaat (Aloo Tikki and Papdi Chaat), Naan/Tandoori Roti with Kadai Paneer, and some Lassi. 

Bad news: We had AWFUL service - I've given it a 0 because: 1. We had to try very hard to catch someone's eye to make our order, 2. We didn't get our Lassi until we asked a second time, 3. We ordered 1 Naan and 1 Roti, so when they brought us two Rotis (absolutely ok.. probably healthier honestly), and we told them about the error, the lady basically told us we were wrong and walked away before we could respond. We thoroughly hated the service.

More Bad news (I know...): The chaat was very bad. In this restaurant's defence, I haven't had good chaat outside of India... Ever. There is not a single place in Canada where I've enjoyed the chaat at all. My Aloo Tikki chaat's components were all separate, with aloo cutlets on one side, chole (chickpeas) in a small bowl on the other and my onions, alone in the corner. The Papdi Chaat for some reason tasted oddly sweet and the potatoes in it had some very strange seasoning that over-powered the dish and did not sit well in my stomach (sadly for me). I get the feeling these guys are trying hard to seem like a fine-dining restaurant, with the way they plate their food - I was not a fan.

Good news (finally): The main dish was wonderful. They claim to make their own paneer (\"cottage cheese\", in their menu), and boy, does it taste great. We specifically asked for Kadai Paneer, which I think they named Chilli Cheese (or something odd like that?) on the menu. It had the perfect amount of spice and flavour, and it was the perfect consistency (not too liquid, not too dry). It went wonderfully with the Tandoori Rotis (wish we could have tried the naan.....), which also tasted fresh. Lassi was alright - not the best I've had. It was not as thick and creamy as typical Lassi is (it was more like its South Indian cousin called Mor).

I would never go back to this place to dine-in because of how awful the service is, but I would order take-out from here and only get the mains."}
{"text":"This is a little gem tucked away in Castleridge that serves authentic Indian Punjabi food. All food, especially the seekh kebab, is well prepared and seasoned. Prices are dirt cheap.

Visit during Diwali festival and taste the magnificent sweets prepared specifically for this occasion.

The category listing includes Middle Eastern. Bombay Sweet House does not serve Middle Eastern food, only fabulous Indian food."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. Small place with simple decor but a very good buffet. Paneer, butter chicken and the naan bread were all standouts. Not licensed I don't think so you have to select your beverage from the fridge in the sweet shop out front which was different but fine. Fair price and would return to dine."}
{"text":"Great Place for Good Punjabi Food in Calgary.. I say Best India Food Place.. its not Big dinning place but there Buffet Selection is definitely Biggest."}
{"text":"My mom, sister and I would come here every saturday for lunch, the food is fantastic, and although sometimes it can take a little while to get your food, it's well worth the wait. the butter chicken, amazing! and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to buy Indian sweets in Calgary, Bombay Sweet House is one of 2 places (Apna Punjab Sweets being the other) where you can get high-quality sweets and a great selection. 

Since Diwali was this weekend, we headed over and were blown away by the display Bombay Sweet House put together. Talk about a spread! There were sweets EVERYWHERE, and they were as good as they get!

During Diwali, I would say by far, that Bombay Sweet House is the BEST place in the city to get mithai (Indian Sweets).

For the rest of the year however, I do say that Bombay Sweet House still has the highest-quality sweets, however their selection can be hit or miss. Sometimes they have a huge selection, and sometimes the selection isn't the greatest.

The good news is that the two MAIN sweet houses in Calgary are located pretty much across and behind one plaza from the next. Apna Punjab Sweets & Bombay Sweet House, together, will definitely deliver all the sweets you can handle for this lifetime and the next.

Got a sweet tooth? Head on over!"}
{"text":"Bombay Sweet House is a casual little eatery tucked in the middle of a strip mall in Castleridge that serves up a quaint and simple lunch buffet that's perfect for when you want to pop in for a quick Indian food fix.

The buffet is a small but solid selection of favourites including the classic butter chicken, tandoori chicken, goat curry, matar paneer, makhani dal and a vegetable selection or 2. There are also a selection of assorted sweets, pickles and chutneys that you can choose from as well, including fresh basmati rice.

The moment you arrive, the staff is already at work getting your fresh naan started in the tandoor oven insuring that a freshly baked batch is delivered to your table once you sit down with your selection. There is nothing like a hot and chewy naan with those lovely charred edges to accompany your Indian meal. 

The butter chicken is a good rendition of  the classic dish. The white meat is moist and tender while the gravy is both flavourful and rich. My favourite, however is the goat curry with its tender goat, braised on the bone in a savoury brown gravy that's perfect for mopping up with the naan.

The selection of sweets here are also good with a fair selection to choose from. Personally, my favourite is the ladu which is not too over-the-top with the sugar, as opposed to jalebi or gulab jamun. 

I do like the convenience of Bombay Sweet House and the fact that the food is tasty and the naan is fresh. It's the perfect little stop for when you want a taste of India in a humble and casual setting."}
{"text":"Delicious samosas and such a great price!! Filled with flavorful spices and loads of warm potatoes and veggies. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, Service not so hot. Get there early or else your scraping the bottom of the buffet trays. You could order off the menu for some fresh eats too."}
{"text":"Decent selection on the buffet. Reasonably priced. The food is very tasty. I go there every 1-2 months. Would rate 3-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Food is good but is a bit too oily. Washrooms were fine but paper towels weren't stocked."}
