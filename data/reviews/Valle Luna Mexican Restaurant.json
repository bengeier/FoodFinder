{"text":"Great atmosphere in the bar area during happy hour. By the way, happy hour is from 3-730pm mon- fri. Saturday is 12-6pm. Chuey or Thomas are usually behind the bar. Awesome bartenders. Both these guys exceed expectations. Get the taco basket basket, will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"me and a friend started our night out here. we were surprised when at the bar we were offered chips n salsa! so since we had never been here, we were like, really? so, Tomas, the bartender took the chips n salsa and gave it to some customers who arrived later the we did! we promptly got up, informed the manager what had happened, that I would yelp about it, and we would never come back. so we went a few doors down to a sports grill, where I had a great  lub sandwich n a few beers which ill yelp about next. I wont go back to poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone downhill. It used to have the best Mexican food at a great price. We each ordered the fajitas which now cost $16, and we received a plate full of saut√©ed onions with 4-5 pieces of over cooked meat and a couple of strips of green pepper. Of course we got the usual pile of beans and rice, but we really felt ripped off. We are really disappointed that one of our favorite restaurants has lost its way!"}
{"text":"Love the patio. Great service and good food..We Had A Large Party and They Were Very attentibe"}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food...seriously the most bland \"Mexican food\" I've ever had.  I guess it explains so many older folks here for lunch.  I cannot believe it was so bland...wow!  I can make better tacos at home. Won't be back...well maybe one day for drinks on the patio in cooler weather.  I had a taco and a tostada."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep trying this place. Last time I got the Mexican pizza on happy hour. It was two soggy tortillas with refried beans, cheese and jalapeno cream cheese (which is shockingly bland and salty). I would rate taco bell higher than valle Luna. Everything is over salted.  The menu descriptions make everything sound amazing and delicious. I think hiring a professional menu author (or whatever the process is) is the only thing keeping them in business, besides the location. if you dine in, you may find the place dark and depressing. Employees reflect this vibe as well. I don't think I'll be back, even with all the coupons they send out every month in the clipper."}
{"text":"Ok. The food was fine.  However the wait staff sucks! The guy we got stuck with had a serious problem with what he seemed to want as a language barrier.  And had attitude when we had to ask him to slow down and repeat what he said. When I asked for another beverage he walked away. So I went to the dar to self service, and...wow! Actually got good service. I hate to give a bad review, but the table staff completely sucked."}
{"text":"My Favorite in the east valley. I crave the hot salsa and chips the food is great always served hot . We mostly sit on the patio its nice we can catch the ball games enjoy a nice dinner and relax. You really don't think about the service cause it is fantastic and everything just happens fast and good. Now I am craving the chips and salsa its been a couple days since we have been, and I just asked my better half if she wanted to go again tonight and she said absolutely so we are gonna fit that into our errands and hope to see you there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience at Valle Luna. Went there for lunch today and had a great time. The service was good. Our server was friendly and attentive, very on top of things. I have not been disappointed in the food either. I usually try something different every time while the wife always sticks her combination plate."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to happy hour you haven't seen the amazing taco basket!  My wife and I love to grab a taco basket, wings and sit outside on a nice day.  Every once in  awhile the rush is so big that the service slows down, but on a nice day- who's in a rush?  While the salsa they give you is tasty - the hot salsa could be hotter.  The price is right during happy hour - the food is good - and the service is on point."}
{"text":"Sorry I decided to stop in. Friday happy hour, bad experience.  Cheese  crisp was greasy, wings were old, chewy, and drowning in sauce. My wife had a mango margarita that was too sweet. She tried a different variety that tasted like soap. Waiter (Diego) comped it , thankfully.  When she got home she puked it up. If you want good Mexican, drive on by this dump. Just because the view is good doesn't mean the food is good. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Very good chips and salsa. Prompt, fast service.  Will return in future."}
{"text":"Emailed Valle Luna and the owner responded with the results of an in-depth inquiry into what happened at the restaurant. Sounds like an owner who really cares about her business. Very pleased with this response and happy to continue to frequent one of our favorite Mexican food restaurants!"}
{"text":"The restaurant wasn't bad but nothing blew me away. The fundido (steak) was good, as long as I didn't think about how many miles I'd have to run afterwards to counteract it. I'm a huge dessert fan and their deep fried ice cream was not something I'd order again (this is where they lost the most points with me). I'll probably eat there again before I make a final decision."}
{"text":"Their host Brandon is always super sweet and welcoming! Such great food..their fried ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"The pork fundido was delicious ! Pollo tacos always great. My daughter loves the mini shredded beef tacos."}
{"text":"went out To dinner Last Night after son's Soccer game.  Parking lot of Valle Luna Packed as usual.  We Had a really good waitress, Wish I could remember her name.  We Had good time,Good Company, Good Food, and Great Service. I Highly Recommend There Fundido,I usually get there chicken, last night I tried there steak (really Good) and of course don't forget to try Their Margarita's"}
{"text":"Mexican food is pretty good and authentic.  The bar side/patio is one of two patios. The second patio does not have TVs you cannot smoke out there. Therefore, the bar side patio is much busier.  Very popular place among the chandler residents. Fun atmosphere.   The happy hour is reasonable, but the selection is bar food.  I would recommend the bar patio for those who want to enjoy a drink, watch some sports, and grub on some wings and papas fritas.  I would recommend the other patio for a more relaxed feel- maybe if you have young children.  The patios are beautiful, because you sit over looking the man made lakes Arizona has. Water is relaxing even if it is man made."}
{"text":"Valle Luna has been our choice for Mexican food for years. Today was the one and only time they disappointed us.  They have added a new menu and when the waiter asked me if I wanted grilled or shredded chicken.  The waiter said grilled is better so I said ok    Without telling me that it was two dollars extra  Just to grill. The point is I felt like I was being taken advantage of for more money. It's not the money it's that telling someone is the right thing. The burrito bowl was so and for the price it's mostly lettuce"}
{"text":"I really like their spanish rice and chicken tacos. The salsa is good. The view of the lake is nice. We've always had good service here. The biggest negative is the decor. It could really use some updating. The colors, the dusty tiles...it looks very 80s. I wish they could clear it out and redo with a more modern, simple style."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I couldn't ask for a better place to spend an afternoon/evening. Even the late night bar scene is fun! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"i tried thier Sunday morning $2.99 breakfast at teh Cave Creek Rd. location.  The eggs were cold, teh bacon was cold, the sausage was cold.  The fried hash browns were perfect and delicious.  You have to buy a beverage which for me was coffee, it was so so and cost $2.25.  It is served in the Cantina with bartenders doing the serving  For an award winning restaurant I found this to be disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a regular.  The staff is great with little turn over. The food is good and reasonably priced. Cheap beer! Great salsa!"}
{"text":"Accidentally ate here after forgetting that the food is terrible. Ordered a combination plate of a pork taco, a beef tostada and a chicken enchilada. I got a bean tostada that was soggy, a chicken enchilada that tasted like pork and had grizzle in it and a stew like porkish slop placed in a crispy tortilla shell. This time I will remember to go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Decided on going here tonight with family. Got a table pretty quick. Was prolly 15 mins before the waiter acknowledged, then about 5 more mins until he came back to take our drink and dinner order. Well 35mins later the food arrives, but during the wait not a single word from waiter as to why so long. The waiter during the meal never checked back to see how everything was. VERY poor service this visit. We go here on a regular basis and we are very disappointed.  We ended up talking with the manager about the server, he was very sorry that we had a bad experience and he took care of some of the items on the bill and offered dessert.  Food as always is very good and we plan on still going there for our monthly Fundido fix,"}
{"text":"I don't really love the food here, but it's my boyfriends favorite. Our waitress Leah was AMAZING!! Best waitress I've ever had anywhere. Super attentive and anticipated our needs as to extra napkins, spoon for salsa with my tacos, etc. She made me actually like this place."}
{"text":"Poor service, food not that tasty, the best thing they had available was my coke and margarita. It is a cute restaurant but did not meet my expectations at all. They need to go on restaurant impossible ..."}
{"text":"Valle Luna is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley! The atmosphere is great and all the employees there are very friendly! I recently discovered jalapeno cream cheese sauce over my shredded beef burrito! Amazing! If you're new to Arizona and you want some good Mexican food go to Valle Luna!"}
{"text":"The view here is spectacular. You may either choose to eat on the patio or inside but I ALWAYS love to sit by the water and eat this delicious food. I have never been disappointed here yet."}
{"text":"Love this place -  best Mexican food in Chandler. Since Senor comes in second."}
{"text":"Food is about average for Mexican restaurants of the same caliber - Macayos,  Serranos, etc. The atmosphere is what sets this restaurant apart...patio dining with a lake view is fun for the kids or good for romantic evening."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day because I had a coupon and I love Mexican food, so I was excited to give it a try. I have to say, I was disappointed. I had the shredded beef chimichanga- it was so-so. I've definitely had a more flavorful chimichanga at a cheaper price elsewhere. I was also not impressed by the service. Our waiter never came to check on us, other than taking our order and bringing the food, which meant we had empty water glasses most of the time. Not cool. But on the plus side, they have a killer bean dip. I'd go back just to eat the chips and bean dip, but probably sit in the bar for (hopefully) better service."}
{"text":"It's been mentioned, however it's extremely true. The bean dip rocks. Lots of Mexican restaurants start you with chips & salsa, but warm bean dip? Leet.  The location of this place is really nice, situated on a lake in the corner of a large complex. For some reason, I like how they are set way back in the corner and their front door is not immediately in front of you at the curb.   I've only been here twice, and I sat in the bar both times. Got pretty decent service, refills took slightly longer than I like but it looked like our server was the only one running around the bar and she was prego, so I'm not really going to fault her. Plus she was super sweet.  I'll be back because of the notable perks I have experienced so far:  Mmm, warm beans. Yes please! They have good happy hour specials, even on weekends (the mini burritos are YUM!)  And they have Michelob Ultra on draft."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  The service was prompt and very friendly.  I really felt  at home here.  The food is fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I am a serious foodie (:"}
{"text":"Arriving at the restaurant, the lunch hour hostess (ink covering her left arm) directed us to a dark corner booth. When asked if we could sit by the windows,  she rolled her eyes and pointed at the empty booths available.  Perhaps she should work in the back of the house instead of greeting customers.    Our server, Christa, was very polite and professional! She did a fantastic job and almost changed our opinion of this visit.  Our order was very good and very hot!    We noticed that the lunch hour hostess was training a new employee.  Big mistake, she needs to be retrained herself!  After coming to this restaurant for about six years, this will probably be our last visit!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  Has a very delightful evening with my husband and decided to stop in to one of my favorite places to have a bite to eat.  It was late so we sat in the bar area.  Big mistake!  I felt like I was in a dance club, the music was blaring so loud.  I can get past that.  What I can't get past is the type of music that was playing.  I actually had to ask my husband if I'd I heard correctly.  Yes I did!  F-bomb dropping all over the place!  Very hard rap with very harsh lyrics.  I was completely shocked that my favorite Mexican food restaurant would allow music in their establishment that would have such harsh words in it.  I ended my very lovely date night with my husband very angery and I have Valle Luna Mexican Restraunt to thank.  So Thank you!  We could not get out of there fast enough.  The only reason we stayed as long as we did was the food.  It was as delishes as always. But the food does not make up for my dining experience and will not be back.  2 lost customers."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. Excellent service! Our server Ryan checked on us frequently and always made sure we had what we needed. The bus boy Anthony helped with keeping the chips, bean dip, and salsa full. My girlfriend had the fundito and I had the Fajitas. Both were excellent and well priced (even without a coupon). The lake and lighted fountain made for a next scenery while we enjoyed our dinner. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Margs and appetizers.  Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK?  Holy MOLY what do they put in those things?  Food was great, drinks were better, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"IS IT THE WATER ?  My wife dragged me to this place maybe five times before I finally said enough. The food and service was poor each time. I tried 5 different items on the menu and they all tasted the same (like not good cafeteria food). The atmosphere is OK if you sit by the water. They have a nice Mexican tap beer selection (the best in Chandler unfortunately for me). And this place is crowded too so somebody likes it. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I brought my boyfriend here about a week or two ago because I crave it all the time. I usually get a chimichanga every time. The frozen strawberry margarita was sugary and amazing! The service is great and everyone is very friendly. The food is amazing! We will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great location right off the lake with indoor/outdoor seating, family friendly (Weds are family night), great Mexican food (yes, its greasy)-with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! =) Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!"}
{"text":"We normally love your place but why would you not have some kind of specials on margaritas for cinco de mayo?"}
{"text":"I've been here before and it was good food and good service. Today was definitely not a very good day. Four of the hosts were crowded at the door touching each other's hair and not welcoming customers or saying thank you. They had attitude as well. Our server looked like she got deal a wrong hand for the night so was unfortunately taking over her problems with attitude and gossip. A whole crew of servers were standing behind our table gossiping. I will not come back here even if i like the food. I am a waitress and there was absolutely no excuse for the service we had tonight."}
{"text":"I have been going here with my family for years but lately we avoid this place. During our most recent visit to this location, the salsa was very watered down and the fajitas definitely weren't as good as they used to be. There was less chicken which seemed to be substituted with more onions and bell peppers. In addition, it took a while for the waitress to greet us and take our drink order. She was not very friendly and we seemed like an inconvenience to her. Thank you for the great food and service in the past but we will be going elsewhere until this place is turned around."}
{"text":"Good food, nice outdoor patio, moderately priced....unfortunatly, service needed some work. They offer unlimited chips and salsa and bean dip, and negro modelo on tap! Amazing chicken chimichanga!!"}
{"text":"The food here is just not good. Not that it's particularly bad, but there is much better available nearby. It's bland in the way that wholly Americanized Mexican food always is, and the ambience of the place isn't really appealing either. The people who only wanted chips and drinks looked like they were having fun, but I can't speak from experience on that. The view of the lake is kind of novel in this area, but you're really only looking out over a big pond at some apartments, which gets boring very quickly. In short, I'm not really sure why anyone would want to go here, I'm pretty certain that regardless of what you're looking for, you could easily find better nearby."}
{"text":"The wait for our food was about an hour, but we did have 8 adults and a baby. The waitress, was nice but the food was ok at best and a few of the items were wrong. Our reservation that we made was lost and the person checking me in made me feel stupid that I even would think we had a reservation."}
{"text":"Had a lunch date with my mom there it was great. It was a first time going and we are definitely going back. The lake view was great. The service was efficient and there wasn't to long of a wait. We loved the food and being from Sonora and them claiming that they have sonoran-style we definitely agreed. They're Chimichangas were delicious."}
{"text":"Shitty service from the shitty bartender Tomas.. so I  told the manager we will never be back."}
{"text":"this place is bomb..... been here on several occasions...... with friends and family !!! service is great.... food is delicious ..... perfect place for friends and family .... you van count on having a good time when you eat at valle lunas !!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food... Good luck finding a place to park!"}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly.  However, after they decided to allow patrons to bring guns into the bar I stopped going.  I simply can't take my children to a place that mixes guns and alcohol."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there before a concert a couple of Sundays ago.  The service was good, the food was good except for the cream cheese appetizer.. I forget exactly what it was called, but it tasted okay but looked horrible, like scrambled eggs or something, we didn't finish it.  Margaritas were good and very strong (which was nice) :) but the ambiance was just barely okay.  Reminded me of an old 80's place that hasn't been updated since.  Probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, Great patio on the lake. The cantina side is where we go, every time we're there. The TV's are kind of small, not placed very strategically, but it is a blast for NFL Sunday. Good drink specials, too. At night, on Thurs & Sat, they have a DJ."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Mexican restaurant.  Supreme nachos are great.  And so is the shrimp fundido."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, but service was terrible. Asked for extra salsa, never got it for dinner. We were never checked in on after we received food. Also waitress took our receipt right out off our table before the ink dried and had to lean in over our to go boxes to get it. Very rude."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night. Men's rest room had lots of standing water (?). LOTS. No the first or second time this has happened."}
{"text":"I am having a hard time finding AMAZING mexican food in arizona.. but valle luna has some tasty bean dip to go along with those thin chips. First impressions make or break with me.. so that definitely helped! I have tried multiple things here and each time i am happy with my decision! mmm and mango margaritas are sooo good!"}
{"text":"They have corona light, dos equis amber and negra modelo on draught.  The chips and bean dip are really good.  They have really good enchiladas."}
{"text":"Friends and I were in search of a location...the first two to were duds. One wasn't open and the other was at a hotel bar. My girlfriend suggested this place and I couldn't be happier.  Great atmosphere, wonderful food for a good price. Staff was so friendly and tolerated me during my day drinking session!   Great job!"}
{"text":"I usually go here for business lunches although it's not the best idea due to the slow service. It is not the employees fault though, this place is always understaffed - especially in the bar area and on the bar patio.   If you aren't in a rush though and can take your time, bring your patience with you and sit on the bar patio. It is right on a lake and the view is beautiful.   I like how the chips and salsa comes out with a couple salsa bowls as well as a bean bowl. That is different from what I've seen at most Mexican food restaurants.   The fajitas are a good choice and are always very flavorful. If you ask for corn tortillas be prepared to wait about 15 minutes for them. Happens to me every single time, even if I ask for them when I place the order.   The guacamole is fresh and cold from here.   The margaritas kind of suck and have too much mixer in them, but they are cheap so I always order them anyway.   This place is great if you have a Mexican food craving,  time on your hands, and aren't picky about your cocktails. The food is always what brings me back."}
{"text":"Foods alright, but patio atmosphere is worth the trip."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican food. Relaxed by the lake I have never been dissatisfied"}
{"text":"I'll agree w/ the other reviewers, average, but I think its gotten  PRICEY for average.  I do love their pollo fundido."}
{"text":"The food here is predictably good, not great. It does not display depth of flavor or creative anything. The portions are large and the view of the cement lake,  well... It's a good deal if you are over 50/55 on a Tuesday the second entr√©e is 50% off, The service is good. Sadly, their signature bean dip is no longer served gratis with the salsa. It is still available but you pay for it. That was actually my favorite thing about the place. The margs are really good and the bar always hopping. They must have a decent happy hour."}
{"text":"I have experienced the best of Valle Luna in 3 very different settings; the typical dinner dining, happy hour, and special event.  Those situations get 4, 3 and 5 stars respectively which averages out to a solid 4-stars.  The food has been consistent all around.  It's much better than the Mexican drive-thru's, not quite as good as Globe food, but pleasing with no surprises around any corners.    Happy hour and the dining room have completely different atmospheres and service.  The dining room was a typical Mexican food restaurant feel, with decent service. It was quiet and the tall booths make it easy to forget about other tables nearby.  The bar (the only place you can get happy hour deals) is loud, crowded, hectic and has had questionable service.  Not horrendous, but I think the servers are stretched too thin.  Getting refills on drinks that come with free refills seems to be a recurring issue... getting a second beer or margarita is not.  The happy hour appetizer menu is hefty enough to serve as dinner, which makes for a good cheap meal!  I'll put up with the bar environment for 3 tacos for $4.  I cannot say enough good things about the private event I attended here...the disclaimer is that I didn't organize it, so I don't know how the back end was.  My future in-laws planned our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding, and Valle Luna proved to be a perfect venue.  We were out on the patio, right on the water.  It was mid-April so the weather was perfect. The set-up was functional.  Everybody loved the food.  All props to the decorating go to my mother in-law, but Valle Luna was on top of their game with service, ID'ing the appropriate parties, and making the whole event appear seamless to the nervous bride."}
{"text":"American adapted Mexican menu.  I loved exploring the menu until I thought to ask about trans fats in the flour tortillas.  Yes, there are trans fats!!!  Shocked.  How could any local restaurant use an ingredient that goes in; but, doesn't come out: collects around organs and clogs arteries.  I now have to find another American-Mexican restaurant.  Sad."}
{"text":"Although Valle Luna used to rank high on our list, my last visit there has caused me to boycott this restuarant.  I will summarize the story, as I don't like to draw out details.  I am a very forgiving and patient person but this incident was truly an example of extremely poor customer service.    After my mother passed away, my friend gave me a Valle Luna Gift card.  Eventaully, because it was emotional, I used it with my family.  After I tried to pay using the gift card, the waitress returned to tell me that the card was not activated.  I asked to speak to the manager and she advised that she would look into it on Monday.  2 weeks passed and I decided to follow up on it.  The manager than had conflicting comments, but bottom line, she cannot do anything to help me unless I have the receipt.  I explained, as I did the night we dined there, that I did not feel comfortable asking my friend after 3 months of receiving the gift since the chances were very low that she would still have the receipt.  Also, it made me very uncomfortable that if she didn't that she would then feel bad.  In short, the manager advised that if they honored everyone's gift cards that were not activated then they would be out of business.  She basically was accusing me of trying to use a stolen gift card.   I asked her to please check with the owners to make sure they agree with her decision to do nothing.  She did email the response saying that there is nothing that can be done and oh, very sorry for your loss.  (talk about salt in a wound).  A little more background:  We have been a very loyal and regular patron of Valle Luna for as long I can remember, well over 10 years.   On average we spent $1200/year there.  So, we have spent at least $12,000 over the past 10 years.  Value of the gift card:  $30  Interesting business model employed.  And this coming from a restuarant that has buy one get one meal coupons abundantly."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is very poor. The wait to get a water is too long. The waiters generally get your order incorrect. The food doesn't make up for the terrible service they provide."}
{"text":"Chicken fundido is amazing. Spinach enchiladas are awesome. Salsa was awesome too. I love eating there."}
{"text":"Shrimp Fundido - awwwwwwwwwwwwwsome.  Great service, good food.  Glad there is one so close by!"}
{"text":"Always great service. The food is also good and well prepared.  Prices are very reasonable too. I have been here many times with my wife. Chicken or beef enchiladas and flan for desert."}
{"text":"This place is good. Love the people and the drinks. Food is always hot. You will leave with a smile on your face guaranteed. Try it out just once you will see."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. There was one hostess that was really nice. The other girl who took my to go order was in a MOOD lol. The food tastes delicious but I'm annoyed that the moody chick told me the tacos were really big so I only got one instead of 2. Well it wasn't and all I have left is a tub of beans and tortillas chips. I'd go back because it tastes good but maybe I won't have the $9 taco lol"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. Beautiful patio, great food and drinks, and even better prices. But in the years I've been going, I have only had one positive experience with the service and server's name is Brittany. If she isn't serving me, I have a server who clearly doesn't want to be there or serve me. I'm having to wave them down to even get my water refilled and not treated like a guest when they are at the table. I don't want to stop coming here, but I also don't know if it's worth it."}
{"text":"The Mexican Pizza with chicken was delicious! Nice view of lake and a good vibe for some playoff football."}
{"text":"Fundito was good...not great.  I got it with pork.  The pork was cooked perfectly...nice and moist.    My wife's bean & cheese burrito was bland (at best).  She wasn't impressed at all.  The salsas (both mild and hot) were flavorless and runny.  The hot tasted like Ketchup with a small bit of spice.  We even had some of the bean dip...not so good.  The chips were greasy too.  Valle Luna used to be some of the *BEST* Mexican food around... What happened?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Valle Lune is awesome. The Mexican pizza, tacos and potatoes skins were awesome. Go for Happy Hour! Mango margarita was strong -loved it!"}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to our server Brittany. She was awesome! It was happy hour on Tuesday night and the place was really busy. Not only did she NOT write our 6 person order down, but she got everyone's food correct and was very attentive despite them being busy. Good with bringing drink before you ran out. :)"}
{"text":"The tortillas that they use for their chips and tacos are fantastic and some of the best I have ever had.  The rice is good with a perfect amount of cumin.  If you go when the weather is nice you can sit outside right by the lake, and if the kiddos are at home it makes for a romantic night out.  I have been here three times, and although it's not \"wow gotta have\" it's a safe bet that the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Came into town from Florida and wanted to take my husband's staff out to dinner (party of 10) we had Jessica as our server and what a great server she was handled our order like a champ, kept our drinks filled (bar drinks and non) orders were all perfect! Great server and service will definitely be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna has been my go to Mexican restaurant for 2 years now. Tonight I had the pleasure of having Brian as my waiter. He gave the best service I've ever received at this restaurant. Very laid back and genuine! he also gave excellent advice for the different meals my group was ordering, for example he recommended the grilled chicken for the taco salad which was amazing! On top of that he was fast and always made sure we had everything we needed- never left us wondering where our server was."}
{"text":"Large portions, great taste but the service is a bit lacking."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for happy hour.  You can get a dozen wings or a taco basket, add a  Mexican import beer, free chips and salsa plus bean dip. All this for $8.50. You can up the beer to a 32oz for just $1 more.  The food is very good, I was very happy and returned the next night to try it again.  They have a nice menu for happy hour, I have tried the wings and the taco basket, they were both excellent. Have to go back and try some of the others soon!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give it no stars. The food is all right super greasy but Okay for a few chips and Margaritas. Oh and  the only place worth sitting is the bar. The front hostesses are total C U Next Tuesdays. We walk in late on a Sunday night after painting and we are tired. Bar is full so we go to leave. The hubs says let's get a table. We ask for a table, not one of their super uncomfortable booths. The hostess tells us there's not a table available except on the patio. It's 45 degrees out. While the staff is sitting waiting for patrons at tables. When I say can't we sit there she just stares at us.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Colleagues from India, UK, NY and locally enjoyed Valle Luna.   While no table was promised, a table for 7 overlooking the \"Lake\" was ready when we arrived.  Good authentic margaritas. Abundant chips and salsa with an appetizer of guacamole. Made two ways, one regular and one hot.  We chose Fajitas, Chili Relleno, and chicken enchiladas.  Larges portions, most (but not all) staff were friendly , and good value.  Outdoor seating with view of lake...perfect for the cooler evening.  Moment of humor: one colleague ordered a drink of Baileys Irish Cream on ice. Order was met with disbelief. Two people came out to double-check that's what he really wanted. Guess they don't get too many orders for this stuff.  PS Can't say how Valle Luna compares with other area Tex-Mex...but infinitely better than anything in NYC.  Would return. See pics."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Took my father there for his birthday.  When the food arrived, he was the only one that didn't get his food. It took 15 minutes to flag the waiter and when we asked about his order the server lied and said it would be 3 more minutes. After another 15 minutes we asked again and were now told that his order \"somehow ended up on another ticket and it would be another 20 minutes\".   The rest of the table was now finished with their food.  When my husband asked to speak with the manager, the manager defended the server and told us if we didn't sit down and be quiet he would call the police! Needless to say my poor father's birthday was ruined."}
{"text":"Here for lunch during week day. I ordered chicken burrito lunch special with green Chilli source. I asked to put the cheese aside not on top of the burrito so it doesn't overrun the Chilli source flavor. Also asked for the whole bento bean instead of refried. It was a delightful lunch! Didn't touch the cheese at all."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted in my life ( until I went to Macayos!!!)  So now its the second worst Mexican food I have ever had.  We had an appetizer that was overcooked or over deep fried little tasteless burritos that were supposed to come with a bean dip that didnt come til we were done with the appetizer.  When we asked for the missing bean dip our waiter got a bit defensive about it.  It was so bland and tasteless anyway and we didnt eat it. We had a chili relleno that was just awful.  It was swimming in oil, a thick slick of oil.  Very weird feeling in your mouth.  I almost vomited literally but instead I spit it out in my napkin.  I had a combo burrito and taco and the taco was in the deep fryer so long that the edges of the meat were black and the cheese they stuffed inside never melted so it was a weird combo taste texture.  The burrito was about the best thing but still the worst I have ever had.  There were lots of tiny pieces of what appeared to be red peppers and green peppers as well as onions in the meat mixture but it seemed to be old as if it had been in fridge or left over a couple days.   Someone else said that the beans were like play dough and yes thats a good description! The chips and salsa also not that good.  Salsa wasnt the worst but not that good and was definitely not fresh or made by them and the chips were so brown they were almost burnt.  The waiter was a bad mood jerk.  The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful with the lake and the fountain all lit up at night.  Gordon Ramsey really needs to make a visit to this place.  I cant believe they are in business since 83 and that people recommend this place.  What are they thinking????"}
{"text":"UGH.  One, they don't honor groupons or restaurant.com certificates on any happy hour items. Two, the food is definitely not the best Mexican in the area. There are far better places within a block or two.   It's overpriced and definitely not easy on the stomach. We had margaritas, beer, the chicken nachos, and some 1/2 taco baskets. Today, all three of us have some serious stomach issues. The nachos were large (and for $15 they should be) but they had cheese, onions, refried beans, jalapenos, chicken, and sour cream. We had to ask a number of times to get our salsa refilled (there was never enough, and only one brought each time). The tacos didn't taste like much, just deep-fried shells without much flavor.  The ONLY thing I liked was that refried beans are served with the salsa and chips.   Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible service from Esteban, no pre-bussing, no refill on pop, we sat for over 5 minutes before we were acknowledged, and he walked by the table 3 times.  Chicken wings were overcooked and extremely dry. We split a taco basket 1/2 chic, 1/2 beef, very bland, no seasoning to the meat at all. The veggies for the wings were old and dry and obviously old by the fridge burn on them.  It's a great patuo, and the cocktails were good, too bad the food and service were awful.  Lastly it states it's non-smoking outside, there were several ashtrays next to us, full of butts, definitely un-appetizing."}
{"text":"I loved sitting outside (with the misters on!) and enjoying the company of my daughter with delicious food. We were served right away and the restaurant looks clean. Can't wait to take the hubby over!"}
{"text":"Too many birds on the back patio.  It's to bad because the view is wonderful."}
{"text":"UPDATE***Jesse, the manager, followed up and was very professional and apologetic. She assured me this was not their standard practice. I feel she handled it very appropriately and we will definitely give Valle Luna another chance. Besides, they do have amazing food and I would hate to swear them off forever:)"}
{"text":"it's a winner.  make sure you sit outside on the lake and order the mini taco basket split between 2 people.  free chips, salsa and bean dip are plenty especially along with the ritas on the rocks.  it's also a kick azz happy hour because the apps are half-off.  the food is cheap and super good.  don't try and walk around the lake though.  it doesn't connect up in a full circle.  and don't swim in that sh*t either.  just eat the good food at valle luna:-)"}
{"text":"Best food, drinks and service. My wife and I love this place. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place! Sits right on the lake offering a beautiful view of the fountain. The restaurant is appealing with the authentic mexican look. The food is good. The service is good. Avoid Friday and Saturday if you are looking for quiet dining"}
{"text":"The lake view is what brings my friends and I to this place for an occasional dinner. Place gets packed so we try to come later than the prime time dinner rush. That really works best on the weekend when the hours of operation are a little longer. So... I've tried a lot of their dishes - Fundidos, Shrimp Enchilada Dinner, etc but once I tried their Shrimp Stuffed Poblano Chiles - that was it! I could never try another dish off their menu. Like the pathetic and predictable crack addict that lives for the next hit I come here and predictably get that each and every single time. I mean it comes with everything I love - shrimp, calabacitas, chiles, melted Monterey Jack cheese and jalapeno-lime cream sauce. So Valle Luna, don't you ever ever ever ever ever take that off the menu or I will walk out of your restaurant for the last time ever after throwing a tantrum that would have even embarassed John McEnroe back in the day. One valid complaint that I'm not alone in (judging from OTHER reviews) is they stopped serving the bean dip with the chips. Now it's just the blander salsa that the chips come with. And now they charge a kidney for the beam dip if you still want it. Well not really THAT much - it's more like just a big toe or something. But they used to give it for free as part of the complementary chips and dip. For that I dock a star - since that awesome dip was a mandatory part of the complete Valle Luna experiece. Lots of parking - shares a mall with Nate's Third Base, Sprouts, Hon Machi Sushi, Coffee Rush, and Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"good quality food which is why i return but the last few times that i have came i sit at a table for 10 minutes with no service. the first time i left, this time i finally got my chips and salsa before i can leave so i stayed. I don't know my waitress's name and i've been sitting here ready to order with my waitress nowhere to be seen. it sucks that i love coming here for good food but horrible service.  i completely understand busy hours but i don't understand waiting 10 mins before being attended to."}
{"text":"I always forget this place is here.  It has probably been 15 years since I have visited Valle Luna.  I was looking on my nav system for a new place to take the kids and rediscovered Valle Luna and I am glad I did.  It was very busy when we went in, there was an ASU game and the lounge was very boisterous.  The kids enjoyed the view of the lake.  I can vouche for the chili verde pork enchiladas and my grill like there ground beef tacos with rice and beans (they said the tacos weren't as good as what mom and dad make though ;) but they ate it all up.    Chips are bean dip are similar to Serrano's and the kids really liked them."}
{"text":"We found our recent dining experience to be most excellent.  The food portions are huge - I could enjoy seeing some smaller meal choices for a less expensive price.  In my opinion, the best value on the menu is the Pollo Sandwich - if you like chicken.  It is easily enough for two people.  I had cheese enchiladas, which were very good, but a bit too cheesy and needed more sauce.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  I hope to have room next time to try some delicious fried ice cream.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times with my family.  Good food at reasonable prices.  Usually packed on the weekends.  Service is just ok. Parking is difficult on the weekends but we will return :-)"}
{"text":"Great homestyle Mexican food. If you like heat, order the pedazos, which are actually considered an appetizer but the serving is so big it can easily be shared. It's this delicious pulled beef/chile combo stuffed inside a giant,  cheesy quesadilla. Heaven. Eat it with the mexicali relish and it's game over. Its the only thing I order. Love the bean dip and chips, too.   Service can be a little hectic,  but I've seen most of the waitstaff always just hustling and bustling all around so I think that's why, and I'm fair when taking that into account. Maybe add some staff to take the pressure off? Wait times suck during peak hours (Friday night, for example.)  It's certainly not gourmet but it hits *the* spot when you get that naughty-bad-for-you-good-for-the-soul-craving for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great place, love Brittney, Tomas and Chuey.  Food is always predictably decent, service is really great.  Awesome view of the lake, great patio.  We love this place!!"}
{"text":"Food was better then I expected to be honest. Would go back for sure if I was in the area. I got the spicy matcha burrito. Super spicy"}
{"text":"Just went in for the first time and had the Fundido! It was so good, definitely the best I've ever had. I would have given 5 stars but the servers weren't particularly friendly or attentive."}
{"text":"Visiting from Pa...great food great service. Sat outside"}
{"text":"This is the only mexican food place that i actually get excited to eat at! I have tried various dishes, but the best thing to get in my opinon is the carne asada burro dinner! I get it with no red sauce and a side of sour cream! It is so good!  Today there was no wait and the chips, salsa, and bean dip was placed on the table right away. The server arrived and was pleasant and got our drinks fast!  Other person with me got a #8 which is two tacos. They were ground beef and they stated it was the best tacos out here in AZ!  See corresponding photos and make your own judgement if you can from a photo! If you haven't been it is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If there was a zero star option I would choose it!  They messed up tacos, how can a Mexican place mess up tacos???  The service was very slow and snarky. I don't think I would come back here again!!!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing dish called 'pollo fundido' which is Spanish for 'fun happy chicken' according to no one.  Anyway the dish is super tasty with like chicken burrito married to a cream sauce and it's super good and you should try it.   Good luck intrepid traveler."}
{"text":"My family from my 30-something kids to the grandkids all love Valle Luna. The service and food is excellent. I've tried almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. The happy hours there are awesome and happy hour selection is second to none My family and I would eat there every day if possible."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been going to Valle Luna since they opened in Ahwatukee, well they closed that one because the rent was so high. Then we starting coming to this location. Well not impressed at all, they have some hostess at the front to seat you, not pleasant at all, seems like she hates her job. Then we sit outside then our order got messed up because our server didn't write it down to begin with. Then the food quality just so so. Not sure what happened if they sold it to new owners or what. Or their kids took over but the food is not good anymore, then they changed the green chili to make it hotter. WTH it was good to begin with that's why people come back. We decided after this last trip, not going back."}
{"text":"Been coming to Valle luna since I was a kid.  Awesome food! Their flower chips are so yummy. Also, great salsa which is important at a Mexican food joint. No complaints on service either! : )"}
{"text":"Came for drinks and food on a Sunday afternoon at the bar top, had a blast.  Had 3 margaritas and the wife had the nogales iced tea! The bartender, Tomas, was friendly, attentive and super helpful to my wife's allergy needs.  He was informative and as a plus to our needs, our cocktails never hit the bottom of the glass. The food was delicious, in fact, i was a little uncomfortable for a few hours since i drank and ate so much.  This was our first visit and we will be sure to return, definitely want to sit on the patio by the lake when the weather gets better! Thanks again Tomas for the fun afternoon."}
{"text":"Wings at happy hour and tacos are really good.  ask for the wings to be grilled you won't be sorry. yum ."}
{"text":"I ordered the tamale dinner, one of each with refried beans and rice.  The green corn tamale was excellent maybe one of the best.  The filling of the pork tamale was stringy pork, good but too dry.  The masa was great however.  The rice was salty which I enjoyed and the beans were perfect.   It is true, they no longer serve bean dip, and the house salsa is sub par.  Better to ask for hot sauce with the chips.  It was busy, but they did a good job with seating and service.  Would like to go back soon."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour that lasts till 7:30! Great drink specials and half off of appetizers. I had two drinks and the guacamole,  which was perfect. My server was prompt and attentive even though it was packed in there. I wish there was more patio seating for the bar area. The patio seating for the restaurant was empty but you cant get the bar specials if you sit there."}
{"text":"Food is good, a bit of the greasy and messy side. I went around the end of the lunch rush and it was quick to get seated and order in. The food took a long time to come out and the waitress did not check on us to refill drinks or anything. We probably waited about 20 minutes for the food to come out. That seems like a long time for a lunch rush. Overall food is good, and typical, value was on the average side."}
{"text":"This was my first time here - my date suggested it after church. Holy Schnikees! The location has a waterfront view - both inside and on the outdoor patio. Beautiful for these parts! The ambiance was well sculpted - each booth is given to privacy. The server we had, Bri, was fun, friendly and helpful! My date had a Vegetarian dish similar to a Fajita. She thought it was excellent! I had the pork Fundido and brother, let tell you, WOWSER!!! A little bit of deep-fried jalape√±o cream cheese heaven was sent my way!  For the food, for the view, for the fun and the helpful service - 5 stars!!! Solid!"}
{"text":"After 15 years I have yet to be disappointed.  Valle Luna \"gets it!\"   Upon entering you're greeted by all staff members you see, seated promptly, salsa and chips hit the table almost instantly, and your server appears in short order.  Next is deciding  what to order from a considerable menu.  It won't matter...It's all good! Whether dining in (lakeside please weather permitting,) ordering take-out, party trays or catering, you'll be happy!  And they're local and family owned...Huge!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Valle Luna ever since I can remember!! They have awesome salsa but not awesome chips. The bean dip is a hit or miss, it depends on who makes it that day. The pollo fundido is my favorite... even though it cost like $15 and an extra $3 for a side of the jalapeno cream cheese. I also recommend the pollo sandwich and the grilled honey-hot wings! Now about the service... it's terrible!!! A lot of the servers have worked at Valle Luna for many years and treat NO ONE with respect. They treat customers like they are an inconvenience then wonder why they don't get good tips lol."}
{"text":"Food was good, parking is a pain in the tukas.... You get what you expect at Valle Luna and no complaints from us, wife did think her Pollo Fundido was lacking in flavor thou."}
{"text":"Kid friendly and nice views of the \"lake\". Friendly atmosphere and good food. Come hungry as portions are decent. Kids menu is decent with a variety of kid options."}
{"text":"Tried this out because of the rave reviews.  Not what I was looking for and we won't be back.  If you want Americanized Mexican food with many fried things or drowning in cheese you will like it here.  There was a ton of cheese on the salads (iceberg lettuce), twice as much as other places that do lots of cheese.  Got the shrimp stuffed poblano chiles - pepper had nice flavor and shrimp plentiful and nicely cooked but again a ton of cheese that overpowered the dish and could not taste or see other ingredients.  No lime crime sauce - maybe cheese buried it or it was forgotten.  Friend got chile rellano - it was ok but nothing special and again lots of cheese.   The meals could have been much better with small changes (use Mexican cheese not American cheeses), don't drown things in cheese (covering up a dish not that good?)."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place ..I would say either the managment crew is mismanaging or hiring the wrong people but the food was awful and the Bar staff are just rude. I will not spend a penny more in this establishment!"}
{"text":"OMG, this place is amazing! We had a hard time finding a table for 7 of us and ended up with something less than pleasing.  The female waitress was irritated with me and you could tell she clearly did not want to wait on us, so a young waiter, I think his name is Jeff, took her place.  He was wonderful, catering to our every want and need, the food was, of course wonderful.  We will continue to come here; however, avoiding the waitress with the attitude problem."}
{"text":"Ate in the cantina area, my waitress Erin was amazing. She was super efficient, attentive, and sweet! Steak fundido=phenomenal. Great place."}
{"text":"Valle Luna bats .250.  Not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to AAA.  Completely average.  I'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  Other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  Perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could..."}
{"text":"I have been a Valle Luna fan for over a decade now and finally found a location close to me again. I brought my wife here for the first time and she LOVED it. this is our new GO TO mexican restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! They're usually super busy but for good reason. They have awesome happy hour deals and dishes in general! My favorites are the wings, quesadilla, cheese crisps & the FISH TACOS!!! Ugh to die for! Love this place! The staff is also friendly."}
{"text":"For anyone who gives this place five stars-I seriously question your taste buds.  This is the Hometown Buffet of mexican food and it left both my friend and I feeling extremely ill.  If you want to spend a lot of money for canned food, then Valle Luna is perfect for you."}
{"text":"Normally when my husband and I visit Valle Luna we split an order of the fajitas and order the queso dip. Last night we had a buy one get one free coupon so we got separate orders.  They were pretty much was the same thing except I got the smothered burrito and he got the enchiladas. I thought that the meat was a little spicy for me but I still ate it. The burrito skin was not warm at all and it was pretty dry. My husbands enchiladas looked better than my dish!  Also I ordered guacamole with mine-$2.50!   I'm sure we'll come back, but next time I'm ordering the fajitas and queso dip!!!"}
{"text":"I started with the complimentary salsa, re-fried beans, and chips followed by my margarita and chicken taco basket everything was really good def one of my favorite mexican restaurants :) !"}
{"text":"Where to start? I came in on a Saturday to a semi busy atmosphere. There were 2 hostesses at the front, one very friendly and the other indifferent to be there - which is ok, sometimes you have off days. Opted to sit outside where the view of the pond was nice along with the weather. Our server may have been new as he misheard or misremembered part of the order and then charged the wrong amounts for our checks. The most disappointing parts of the visit had to do with the high prices and charges for every little thing. My friend ordered street tacos that did not include any type of sauce unless an additional $1.25 was paid. Just not what was expected.."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants of all time, the food is always fresh and hot, and the wait staff are always nice. Order the quest it is worth the extra couple bucks and the tacos or fajitas you can never go wrong.   We actually just used these guys for catering of a party of 80. It can out to about 6.25 a person with left overs yessss.   I will always come back here"}
{"text":"Ordered Fiesta nachos ( total disappointment ) albondigas soup, chips a salsa ( salsa tasted like canned tomatoes with a little cilantro and onion ). The nachos were soggy and loaded with tasteless shredded chicken and beef. Soup was slimy and the meatball tasted like un-seasoned hamburger, the only thing that was good was the cold beer !"}
{"text":"Had lunch here this week, great as always.  The tables are all booths, and the restaurant showcases a waterfront view for many of the tables.  I love the decor and atmosphere, food and service.  It's clean and the people are friendly and efficient.  Food was fresh and excellent, and salsa and chips.  Excellent service from the server Krystle, who was prompt and attentive.  I have been going here for more than a dozen years and it never disappoints.  Their margaritas are excellent so are happy hour deals and the senior nights 2/1 (I think Tue).  They have a great lunch special menu too, that is easy on the wallet.  Overall I rate this restaurant highly and consistently."}
{"text":"sadly, i can't let my old review stand. i hope no one went there based on that review. idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this last time was not good.   the beans on my friends plate looked like dried out play-do. it was really gross to look at from across the table, not gonna lie. and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty. i couldn't handle it.   my food had this weird flavor and honestly....  everything had a weird taste, even my diet coke.  we both agreed everything had a funny taste. idk what it was. i was sad bc last time my dinner was so amazing. i probably won't be going back for awhile. or ever, i haven't decided."}
{"text":"Valle Luna has exceptional Mexican food that is always fresh and delicious. The Chicken Fundido is one of my absolute favorite menu items and I have not found another Mexican restaurant in the Valley that can beat it! The jalapeno cream cheese sauce is TO DIE FOR!! The chicken in the fundido is actual whole grilled chicken breast, fresh and cut up..not the shredded soggy meat that you can get everywhere else. They give you chips, salsa and bean dip before the food comes.   The Happy Hour prices for Margaritas aren't great (around $5.50) but they taste great and I usually only have one for my entire meal. I go to this location at least once a month and the longest I have had to wait to get a table in this establishment was around 5 min. They have a bar area, restaraunt and patio which makes for a lot of seating. If you sit outside on the patio you will be on the waterfront where there is a cool fountain and some ducks that run around.   The prices compared to other good Mexican restaurants in the Valley is about the same. You get what you pay for though...quality food. I took my whole family here for my college graduation and every single person loved the food. My mom is not a huge Mexican fan but she is hooked on the taco salad!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that the reviews connected with this restaurant have to have been written by friends of the owner. If I could have given this place no stars, I certainly would have. Never had I had a more terrible dining out experience than at Valle Luna. I just arrived in Arizona from NY and took my family to dinner there. Six of us sat down to dine and we went to order. Last year I had the best chili relleno dinner here, so I asked for it again. Sorry ma'am, you have to have a taco instead of the two chilis! Why said I, I don't like tacos, can't you just charge me for a second chili. No substitutions! Just take off the taco and put on a chili, don't you want your customers happy? My granddaughter heard him mumble, for a price and for a price it was! Instead of charging me for one chili, they charged me for double chilis, beans and rice...18 bucks for two soggy cheese chilis! Where last year they were crisp and hot and delicious, this year they were two drowned out soggy cold messes lying mixed in with the beans and rice, drowned in tasteless watery sauce. I asked for the manager and Carlos, the manager came to tell me...tough! We have rules. We don't change things! I said don't you care about customer satisfaction? He said, we have rules! I said I guess you don't care about your customers and he shrugged. That says it all! Tasteless soggy food, nasty manager, greasy plates at the table, uncaring waiter..including the one who elbowed me as I left the restaurant. All this for 118 + dollars. Enter at your own risk! I'm sure there has to be better Mexican restaurants in the Chandler area, or at least ones that actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Such a great happy hour and patio. This may seem weird but they have the BEST wings ever. I don't usually eat wings but I can't get enough of the hot grilled ones from them.   Tomas is awesome and always has great suggestions. The rest of the staff is amazing also. I could go on and on but seriously try the wings or fajitas and wash it down with a margarita on the rocks.   The cantina and patio are where it's at. Also don't forget to try the wings."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time! Sometimes when the bar is too full we sit in the regular dining, and let me tell you, I definitely don't recommend it. If you want good service, SIT IN THE BAR! The bar servers know what they're doing. To name just a few: Julie, Alexis and Brittany. Everyone we've had is AMAZING. My favorite drink is the coronarita and we both love the chicken tacos. If you want a good time and over the top service, sit in the bar. You'll have a great time. If you sit in the regular dining area, don't expect great service. 5 stars goes to all the servers in the bar and the bartender."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food. We visit on Tuesday nights for senior night. This is a terrific value with 2 for 1 meals. Sometimes it's good to be a little maturer. The chummy is my favorite. It is not over cooked and is large enough for 2 meals. All the food is very well prepared and the service, even with a larger crowd is great. I have eaten here for many years,  even before I was eligible for the special. This place has always been a great stop.  If you are one of the fortunate to be able to partake in senior night remember that your tips should reflect paying for 2 meals. Let's not short change the wait staff."}
{"text":"Large restaurant with a view of the lake, plenty of indoor seating, outdoor seating, and a separate bar area.  Great salsa, good food, excellent Pollo Fundido.  The margaritas are decent as long as you don't get the house margarita (very cheap tequila)."}
{"text":"4 friends enjoying mexican.  We walked in around 8 o'clock on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table outside.  At first glance, I prob. wouldn't have eaten here.  It was in a strip mall, and really not appealing from the outside.  There was a glow of the red light reading Valle Luna, and neon writing on the glass windows advertisiting the specials and NFL ticket (it's not football season).    Anyway, we had good service and the food was great.  Pros: I loved the chips, salsa, and black bean/refried bean dip they gave us for an app.    The portions were HUGE!  I suggest splitting or come prepared to take home.    Outdoor seating  Neat canopy like booths and tables inside, transporting you to another place  $20 off $60 coupon  Fajitas were able to come with two different meats for no additional charge  All food was really hot (temp wise).  Cons: One of the frozen margaritas came out not blended.  The fruit was on the bottom, still whole, and the ice and booze was taking up the top of the glass.  Our waitress, Jenni, had no problem bringing a beer in place of the unsatisfactory drink."}
{"text":"Best Mex around. Good variety on menu, fokd well prepared. Service quick and friendly. Prices fare. Di it."}
{"text":"We thought we tried out Valle Luna restaurant because we had buy one get one free entree  Worth trip!  The food is excellent, great service unfortunately the air in  part of the restaurant was out but I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great local spot for some happy hour and food to keep you functioning enough to keep throwing back brews. They have this awesome drink called the dogma which isn't for the faint of heart that sets the tone every time I stop by that I always introduce to newcomers. The bar staff is always friendly and quick and the chips and salsa always on point."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for a lot of years. Always had great service and great food. Till tonite I got some bad pork on my tacos, told the server she said she would get new tacos... well all said and done. Had to send chips back -- detail, never got a refill on my tea.. when she finally gave me the check I was charged more for my dinner. She said she would send the mgr to our table never came... so bottom line he took2.00 of the bill-- no apology they just lost a good customer-- they just didn't seem to give a rats butt!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got there on \"Taco Tuesday\" around 6pm and wow was it packed!  We went to the bar area and was able to grab a table top.  Our server was right on the ball with getting us waters and menus.  He made sure we got the chips and salsa to tie us over as the place was packed!! 2nd mention.  We got our order in right away and only had to wait about 20 minutes to get our food.  We didnt order off the happy hour menu but there was plenty to choose from.  My order wasnt correct when I got it but were in a time crunch so didnt want to wait to send it back.  I ordered a combo plate with all chicken and ended up with ground beef :(  Taco fell apart, enchilada was all cheese and the tamale was the worst I had ever tasted.  My daughters ground beef enchiladas were less than par also.  Definately not the quality of food we were hoping for.  Unfortunately cant rate it very highly.  Maybe if we went during a non-happy hour time would have been a different experience however I'll go with my instinct to not go back to try again.   Great service, just poor food."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite. We are usually there once if not twice per week. But the last 4 times, their service has been horrible. Today we were there for 3 hrs. It took the server forever to come and take our order. We had to call him to get a drink and to get refill on our salsa and chips. We could have had another drink, but the server never came after he dropped our food at the table. We had to get the managers attention to explain what was going on, and all she did, was bring our check. We pay our bill and left. Food is AMAZING, service could use ALOT of improvement. P.S. if your memory is not that great while taking our order, use a notebook to take our order down and actually bring out what we order. Definitely going back for the food and drink. Just hopefully we don't get the same server. And hopefully this review, helps the manager of the place as a feedback of what needs to change if they want to capture customers. Because if we choose to spend our money there, we deserve some attention. We could easily go down the street and give our money to another restaurant."}
{"text":"AMAZING happy hour specials. We can get 2 pitchers of beer and eat all the food we want for about $20 on a Saturday afternoon. How can you beat that!? The food is simple and good, the staff is fast and friendly, and the patio is delightful."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are good and it was averagely priced. But the service was honestly really slow. Our waiter couldn't handle our big top, which would be intimidating, but the manager should have kept her in training longer. It's a really pretty restaurant though and the food is average."}
{"text":"I have been to Valle Luna many times, but today was exceptional! We phoned in a take out order to Brandon, and he got everything right! He was very polite on the phone, read back our order, then offered to meet me at the curb, because parking can be a bear. When I arrived at the restaurant, Brandon was there to greet me, he processed my payment and got the order from the kitchen. He then offered to walk it out to my car. I appreciate good service when I receive it, thank you Brandon!"}
{"text":"I had the pollo fundido here, it was pretty good.  I think you would like this place if you are someone who's not afraid of cheese and a little grease to go with that.  Its Sonoran style so U should know that there is gonna be a bit of cheese thrown in.  As for the grease, it comes from all the frying : )    They have pretty decent salsa and chips, but I guess the bean dip does not come standard any more because I did not see them serve that with the chips.  Maybe you got to ask for it.  Food alone should give this place 4-5 stars but the service was a little underpar.  Its not that bad, but certainly was just sufficient without any attempts to improve.  The host was in the midst of seating me but stopped to address an issue with the kitchen on a phone order.  I guess its not a big deal as the bus boys were really fast and would bring u, the salsa and chips and greet u warmly.    As for my server, well I guess she would be a 7/10 service-wise.  Passable but not exceeding anything.  She was in a hurry to put her order in and I noticed her doing the same thing to other customers too.  When the table next to me asked what kind of meat was in their chilli rellenos, she just replied, there is no meat in the chilli rellenos, without any explanation of what it was and if there is an alternative.  The customer got convinced into ordering a pollo fundido which according to the waitress was the same as a chilli rellenos but with a chicken (not really !).    In her defense, she was not rude or uncaring, just very order-oriented and focused on fulfilling them.  She would go around and ask if everything was okay with her charges and did ask if I needed a refill on my ice teas.  I guess its better than a server who would not come around at all, that would be worse.  So perhaps you would want to view the menu online first, using the link on this page and then read about what they were, so you can ask \"educated\" questions about the foods or know right up front what you want, so they can bring you something nice and hot to eat real fast :)  I would come back again if I am craving a nice cheesy (in a good way) meal.  Also the view is pretty good, its overlooking a little lake that it shares a view with Coffee Rush."}
{"text":"They stay busy.  It is nice if you can sit outside on the water.  The service is fast and efficient and the prices are great.  I really enjoy the cocktails and the charro beans.  Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"Their $5 margaritas are always the perfect start to any night out!   Service and cleanliness definitely leaves room for improvement. The bartender we has wasn't very friendly and engaging, and the surrounding tables were filled with crumbs from the chips and salsa. So this isn't exactly where I would spend a good portion of my night, but staying for one or two drinks was fine."}
{"text":"Great local place that I don't go to enough.  The food is really good and they have great specials almost everyday."}
{"text":"2 things that do not go well together: 1) mexican food 2) high prices. With hundreds of Mexican restaurants to choose from, we were lured in with a coupon and Wednesday \"family\" night.  Sure kid gets 4 corn dogs the size of your thumb for $1.50 and the wife and I split a $13 chimichanga + $2 upcharge for splitting (we were stuffed from the bottomless chip and salsa bowl)  now i gotta throw down a few prunes just to keep the pipes clean (and smooth, if you get my drift)  fool me once.....  on a side note, the whole Anderson Springs shopping center is packed to the gills on a wednesday night.  amazing"}
{"text":"I love Valle Luna. Great Food. Great Service.   I came here for my anniversary a couple of weeks ago, and I was blown away by the quality of the service and the food that were provided.   I'm a big fan of the chimichangas, so if you have a chance to grab one, I recommend the chicken chimichanga. They are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Perfect place for date night!  We received a coupon in the mail, buy 1 entree get 1 free up to $11. It's a little far from our house but we decided to give it a shot.  We were very pleased.  It was a Wednesday night, which is Family Night. It was very busy but we were sat immediately because we wanted to sit outside on the patio.  The patio is PRETTY AWESOME! It looks out onto a precious, good sized pond which makes for a tranquil setting.  To make the experience even better there are ducks waddling around making you smile.  Service was a tiny bit slow but they were busy and I've been a server before so I know what's up!  Our server was awesome! He was sweet, informative,  positive and laid back.  We didn't mind at all about the lax and longer wait times because the atmosphere rocked and we were having a great time.  The food was great! We had the trio dips for an appitizer. The guacamole,  chorizo con queso and the cream cheese jalape√±o.  The Cream Cheese Jalape√±o is delicious as well as the guacamole.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Chorizo Con Queso but I had never had that kind of dip before. My man said it wasn't the best he'd ever had but still good. We had the chicken and steak fajitas and the fundido!  Both delicious! The Fundido was definitely worth it!  I also had a Cadillac Margarita.  It's tradition for me to get a Margarita on the rocks with salt and a shot on the side due to the margaritas not being strong enough. I want to taste the tequila and I'm a Lil bit of an alchy.  Anyway....I got a Margarita with 1800 Silver and a Grand Marnier floater with a shot of 1800 on the side.  The Margarita was so strong that I didn't even need the extra shot! Impressive!  We love the place! Definitely worth the drive and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am opening a day spa practically right next to this place so after hours of meeting contractors, taking measurements, etc. in our currently empty space my wife and I were ready for a margarita and some good food. So we decided to try one of new neighbors and I have to say that we were very impressed.   The inside is beautiful with wood beams and little false roofs that make the atmosphere cozy. Of course, the lake is right there which also adds to the atmosphere. Margaritas were $5 on Mondays, which we were happy about because that was number on our list that day. The menu had lots of great choices but we decided to just order two appetizers. We got a mixed mini taco plate and sliders.  Both of our choices were first rate, not greasy, and were served quickly. We thought the service was exceptional. A manager was walking around checking everything the entire time and was actually the one that asked if we wanted a second drink. I always like it when managers are hands on with customers.  My only negative is that one item we ordered was more expensive than we thought. The menu we looked at was for the cantina only, not the main restaurant. Apparently, the cantina has its own specials. I thought that was confusing for a new customer but I don't think they were trying to be misleading at all so I would not knock their rating for that. It was really our fault.  I noticed most of the negative reviews here are old. I thought it was excellent so maybe they changed."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!    They have Buy one get one free coupons in the monthly coupon mailer book and Wednesdays are Family night which have their own specials.  Their Happy hour goes until 7:30pm which is the longest Happy hour around. Also they have daily specials for margaritas and specialty drinks(prickly pear marg is the bomb). $2.75 pints and $8 pitcher of domestic beer on HH too.  This is going to sound strange but they have the BEST GRILLED WINGS!! I would have never thought to try them, but we smelled some as they went by and had to order a dozen. They were SO tasty and flavroful! And from a Mexican place?  We haven't tried the burgers but we heard from other people that they were good too.  The Pork Verde is super DELICIOUS, and HUGE!  I really haven't had anything bad from Luna either. We are here often and each time we always see a new magic trick from Chewy - the awesomest bartender!  The service is quick and when something comes out wrong, they quickly remake the item and it's out without 5 minutes.    The patio has the best view of the lake too since it's in the center. They have tons of TVs, fenced the ducks off the patio, misters, both pubs and tables. It really can't get much better.  I mean, maybe if they had recliners or something but for now I'm all positive and give Valle and big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"What happened? What happened to this east valley landmark? I think it's gone downhill. Four of us sat at a table and none of us were impressed by anything.  I had the most bland fajita's ever. I could feel a cold coming on so I asked for jalepeno's or habenero's or anything to spice it up.......I got nothing.  Servers were attentive and dessert was good, but I can't say anything positive about the main courses. I doubt I will make it back."}
{"text":"Best happy hour!! Weekdays until 7:30. Sit on the patio with a couple margaritas and some mini bean burros without spending $10."}
{"text":"The patio area is perfect.  It sits on the neighborhood lake and it's just beautiful and relaxing.  The patio is large and separates the bar area and dining area.  The food was delicious also.  One person had a bean burrito which was huge and very delicious.  Another had the border tacos, which were very flavorful.  I had the tomato, onion and chili cheese crisp.  It was the size of a pizza and incredibly delicious.  All in all  great meals in a wonderful setting."}
{"text":"Quality Mexican food at a great price! I'd recommend sitting in the cantina area or on the patio for the best atmosphere. The bar backs up to a lake with the cutest little ducks wondering around! As with most Mexican joints, the free chips and salsa are a bonus. They have super cheap happy hour prices and often have buy one get on free entr√©e coupons in the mail. Never had an issue with service, but parking can be a bit of a nightmare."}
{"text":"We used to live down the street from the N. Phoenix restaurant and were regulars at the cantina. This place has an even better cantina and their outdoor section overlooks a man-made lake! Their food is pretty good, though we mainly just eat cheese crisps and grilled chicken wings. And their happy hour is awesome, having great specials and cheap beer.  We'll definitely be headed back to catch a game or just chill on the patio."}
{"text":"The chips, salsa and bean dip are the good reasons to go here.... other than that not much to say.  Everything seems to be sooo greasy and mushy within seconds.  If you order something with a crispy taco, eat that first!  It will be a soggy mess soon.  I have to say that they have a nice patio or drinks which has been a better experience than the food and I wish it wasn't so because I live really close by.  I do have to say that the service is always 5 star."}
{"text":"I crave Mexican food all the time and this establishment will not disappoint. I usually get the Chimi and its delicious and comes with chips and salsa that are also fresh. The take out staff is top notch! Highly Recommended. Wish they would send me more coupons like in the past."}
{"text":"Good location, nice staff, the food is typical AZ Mex, drinks are a little watered down for my taste."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town, the $5.50 taco basket is delicious! The back patio is a great spot to meet friends and grab a drink."}
{"text":"Good food, Service was not the best. Slow and not very good interaction but not rude. Good drink specials."}
{"text":"Visited today after the hubby went with his co workers for lunch. I have to say, I'm impressed. Service was great, the food was excellent, happy hour specials are every day and even my son finished his food. When we were leaving, we saw one of my husband's co worker's who is particularly picky when it comes to Mexican food...so he def must've approved because he came back with his wife!  We'll def be back again."}
{"text":"I loved this place.I usually judge mexican on the staples :rice, chips & salsa and drinks. All of the above rocked. Not only that, but they serve spicy beans to dip your chips in. DELISH! We were seated promptly and with a smile! The waitress was also attentive (making sure our glasses were full) yet not overbearing!   I had the tacos i could barely finish one but thats because I ate EVERYTHING! :)  A great place for a nice hot meal and a place to converse with your company."}
{"text":"I love their salsa I love their pollo fundido And this is my favorite Valle Luna location of them all... thanks to the lake :)  Love it!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is well worth it.   The service was good , my waiter kinda got lost in the crowd ( maybe he can crowd surf)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and some cocktails after a long hike with a friend. Was hoping for some Taco Tuesday specials but they had none. Actually they only had tacos as an appetizer and they were lackluster. We tried a dip trio and a chimichanga which were both good and filling. I also couldn't get enough of their complimentary salsa which was really good. Our server, Christian was very nice.   The only gripe I have with this place is the drinks. I had to send back a drink because i could barely stomach it. I don't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible. We tried multiple drinks and all were awful except for a frozen sangria margarita which was ok. I definitely won't be coming back for the drinks but overall he food and service were good and they had a lot of nice patio space. Shame, I live around the corner and this would have been a perfect spot for cocktails and a safe walk home."}
{"text":"Sunday's are awesome here. Great prices, good quality bar food. Sitting on the patio is heaven!"}
{"text":"$30 for two plates of hot mush. My wife and I had belly aches the rest of the day. Never again."}
{"text":"Food is good . Service is hit or miss.  Prices have gone up in recent years but quality has not."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! They lost our order so it took over a hour to get our food...service was alright"}
{"text":"The food is good but not amazing. Decent sized portions to where, as usual, I eat half and have a full meal for the next day. I would not say I loved the food though. The service was pretty decent, nothing extraordinary. The prices are very good though. My husband and I spend $25 with tip on 2 meals. I have seen all kinds of coupons floating around in those little clippers as well, so keep an eye out! Buy one get one free. This is more of the kind of place where you are hungry but not starving and craving Mexican. They are close so we will be going again, but I wouldn't drive more than 10 minutes to get here."}
{"text":"We have come here many times before and these guys are usually very good but they missed the mark tonight. In their defense, they were VERY busy but...... We had to ask for drink refills several times and the food order came separately and very slowly. The restaurant was clean and had a nice atmosphere. Staff was friendly. Food was \"OK\" compared to previous visits which I would describe as \"very good\". We will come back, but not soon."}
{"text":"The food here is always spectacular but last night my family and I went for dinner and the corner we sat in had this awful stench I felt like we were in the dungeon and our server his  name was Esteban he didn't care at all didnt care if we had refills forgot about us pretty much the whole time usually when you sit in the bar or outside service is good"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is a reasonably reliable Mexican restaurant.  Nothing spectacular, but reliable.  The food is pretty good, the menu has a good variety of \"classics\" (burros, chimis, fundido, etc), the chips and salsa are fine.  Nothing spectacular.   Service is reasonable, and the prices aren't bad (especially if you get a coupon which shows up sometimes in those coupon clipper magazines).  Obviously I'm not raving about this place.  I would put it on par with Garcia's or Serrano's.  Not great, but not bad.  Nowhere near the level of someplace like La Tolteca.  But it was closer, I have limited time for lunch, and I had a coupon.  One thing I will say is they support youth athletic programs.  They have numerous plaques displayed of the various teams they have supported.  Girls' soccer, boys' baseball, etc.  A LOT of plaques.  It's cool that Valle Luna takes an interest in their community like that.  Many places don't.  Has nothing to do with the quality of the food, but when choosing between comparable restaurants like Garcia's and Serrano's, I think it is nice to know I am helping support such things with my patronage of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Drinking water cause they got the pepsi.  Food came out uncooked,  slow service. Server tried to tell me thats how it is.  really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn't melted?  No visit from a manager or anything. this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"still the best place to eat Mexican food. kids can play by the lake and the happy hour deals are perfect for our budget."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food that money can buy. I especially like the machaca beef burrito with rice and black beans.  The green chili burrito is excellent too.  The service is excellent as well as the salsa and chips."}
{"text":"Good chimichangas. Lunch specials are well worth it. Table salsa and chips are great."}
{"text":"We come here often. No complaints, really. However today our cheese crisp lacked the crisp- completely undercooked. After one piece I was done. My husband went ahead and ate the rest. Thankfully in doing so since his wings he ordered were dry and overcooked. Luckily we have dogs at home waiting for them. Service is fine not exceptional. Drinks- we recommend the prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"What do you come here for?  Fantastic frozen margaritas and the patio on the lake.  Other than that, the food is fine and the service lacks.    We hit this place up on a Sunday night about 6p.  We had to wait about 10m and then were seated at booth inside with a view of the lake.  Our server was MIA for a long time and then all of a sudden she almost popped around the side of the booth and asked for drink orders (She never really stopped and stood and talked to us, just popped in and out). At some point a basket of chips with salsa and bean dip came out, which was great because it took FOREVER to get food - we ate every chip!   I had the chile relleno, black beans and rice.  It all tasted fine, but it had no spice, good flavor just no heat.  Oh and another thing about heat, it must have sat back there awhile before the waitress could get to it because it was warm-ish.  So it was all fine.  Not bad, not great. A-OK seems about right.    The only thing I can rave about was the frozen margs. They were a perfect amount of slush and booze!  I would have had more if I my waitress gave us more than a couple pop ins!  Oh well, give it try, may you will like it!"}
{"text":"My most disappointing meal at Valle Luna. We have gone to the Chandler location for years but today our service was very poor at best. Our waiter, who I can't name because he said the name on the tag was not his, did not  provide good service. The booth next to us was seated 10 minutes after us but was served their meals before my wife and I received our order. I had to get up and get my own \"to go\" box because he never returned. Finally got or bill, paid cash, and got out. There are so many restaurants in the area there is no reason to return to one that does not provide good service."}
{"text":"My family came here on Oct 30th with my father who drove across the country to visit. They were not busy, there were only a few tables seated throughout the restaurant. We were seated outside, chips and salsa were brought promptly. We sat there for 25 minutes waiting for service. A server named Will noticed about 10 minutes in and promised to find our server for us. Another 10 minutes passed and I went to let the hostesses know that we hadn't even been greeted yet. At the 25 minute mark a table was seated next to us and were immediately greeted by Cassie, who I can only assume was our server since she was waiting on every seated table around us. She made eye contact with members of my family several times but never acknowledged us. At this point we decided to leave and stood up. Again, Will noticed and began profusely apologizing. He talked us into staying, immediately brought drinks, took our orders, and discounted everything. He is the only reason Valle Luna has any of our money, and they won't be getting anymore of it. The food is underwhelming, and aside from Will, the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I recently held a banquet here for my mother's 50th birthday. It was recommended that I use Valle Luna because they are easy to work with. I made a couple visits to the restaurant before booking the banquet. What had me sold was their beautiful view from their back patio. I was able to set up the menu for the banquet. They answered all of my questions. What really had me sold was on the day of the banquet I had an excellent server called Ricky. I can tell Ricky is a pro. He made sure to ask me all the questions he needed to help me make the party run smoother. There was a very small mix up with a menu item we ordered and he resolved it very quickly. Ricky really made the party. I was able to focus on the guest of honor and other party guests. The service was good and the food was excellent. Everything tasted good and there was enough food for everyone. They were even able to accommodation a last minute desert order. I will consider using Valle Luna again for a banquet!"}
{"text":"The food was so gross!!!!! We sent our margaritas back, and left the majority of our food. I feel sick thinking about it. I can say our service was great! Very friendly and attentive hostess and waiter. Will not go back to this place and would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Not bad food, but the frozen margaritas are really good.  It may have just been what I ordered (shredded beef tacos) but they could back of on the salt!   All in all, I will go again."}
{"text":"This is not going to blow your sox off... but they food is consistent, good variety, and decent quality.  I like their green chili best. Pretty much all I get there now when I go."}
{"text":"The fish tacos and pollo Fundito were awesome.  The view  from our seat looking over the lake was great. The fried ice cream was awesome."}
{"text":"I wouldn't typically to go that kind of restaurant for a mexican food ( I look for hole-in-the-wall type of mexican restaurants), but because I was with a big family who was craving for a mexican dish, I found this place in my area (Southeast Valley). My grannies were thrilled to see the 2 for 1 deal for senior citizens-the place was flooded with happy 'n' stomach-crammed senior citizens-we were waiting for them to leave and tables to clear up. I can understand some of the bad reviews, but the restaurant has been there forever, since I was born, and it's good enough for a big group who aren't very picky about Mexican food. A neutral place in hope to satisfy everyone in the group as there are alot of selections on the menu. I was lucky to have had an amazing vegetarian tamale called \"Tamale Dinner\" (with green chili corns), and apparently, it's one of their specials. I finished the whole plate-the rice and beans were delicious, and I was surprised to leave without an upset stomach (mexican food=be ready for a screwed up digestion function). I wish we sat outside as there is a nice terrace with a man-made lake view."}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago and the food with happy hour was free and delicious! I went there today and my chimichanga was ready in just a few minutes. Fast service, nice staff. about 25 bucks for 2 people to eat. I like this place"}
{"text":"I love Valle Luna! I only give 4 stars because they don't blow me away good. We have so many mexican restarants in the valley to choose from  but what does impress me is that every time I have gone, the food is consistently good.Good chips and salsa which is very important. I love the margaritas there because they are never watered down tasting in fact, they tend to be a little heavy on the liquor which is a good thing but know that  before you plan to drive. I personally don't drink if I am so I always go there and make my husband drive ;-) It is a great place to meet people for food and drinks because they never rush you and it is very relaxed and friendly there. I for one will keep going"}
{"text":"First, I feel bad about this.  I love Valle Luna and have been a regular customer for years now.  Good food, great ambience, and generally good service.  Not tonight.  We settled in the lounge to take advantage happy hour drinks with a plan for a nice long evening ending in a full dinner and desert.  It was a hot day in Phoenix, and even hotter inside the lounge.  In the end I was literally about to pass out and had to leave mid meal to go to the car to cool down. We mentioned the heat to the waitress who, much like her services (I won't go into that, but not good), dismissed us saying it was hot for her too.  Frankly it was inexcusable to have the establishment even opened,  and a waste of patron money ordering food that they are unable to eat.  I would have preferred they had closed the doors until they could get their air fixed."}
{"text":"I love their mexican pizza!  Happy hour in the cantina has great deals, half off appetizers and drink specials."}
{"text":"Mondays are $0.99 margaritas, cant get a better Happy Hour price than that. I am apart of a local Chandler meet and greet group and we have discovered this great special and plan to be back every Monday while we support local Chandler businesses.  We sat on the patio next to the beautiful lake, so relaxing and peaceful.  The patio is large and has multiple TV's for everyone.  Our server was awesome, with our large group if 20+ people she was attentive, sharp, friendly and provided awesome service.  Haven't been to Valle Luna in many many years, but it was just as awesome as I remember."}
{"text":"Well my family and I have been customers for 10+ years now and I have to say Valle Luna just ain't what it use to be. We hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner here 8 years ago and this is a \"must go to\" restaurant for our out of town guests. However its just not as good as it use to be. The food isn't as good, the service is definitely not as good either. We come back because my husband craves the taco basket on the regular and the chips and salsa are pretty tasty, they also have good specials throughout the week. I wish they would bring back some old recipes (seafood enchiladas) and update their decor, mainly the tables. Also, get a more friendly and professional host/hostess staff. If you are a fish taco lover, don't get them here... they are the most boring fish tacos I have ever eaten and they are not cheap. Just my personal opinions."}
{"text":"Great food on the patio. The margarita special is fun even though they are super sweet. We usually bring a coupon when we can get them because it usually saves at least $5 or more. It's perfect to hit this place up for lunch and then go a few doors down for amazing ice cream."}
{"text":"Took family for Happy Hour last night and had the best service from Brittany.   She took all of our food and drink orders without writing anything down and everything came out perfect.  Thanks Brittany!"}
{"text":"The location is nice, the service was good, but in my opinion, the food has gone so far downhill I hope never to return. It's not that the food is gross or anything like that, it seems fresh but the flavor is just so blah. My parents and grandparents love it but if you like spicy, flavorful Mexican food this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"bland bland bland!  If you like Mexican food with no taste then this is the place to go.  The salsa tasted like tomato sauce, the bean dip had no flavor, and I don't think I've ever had a more tasteless chile relleno in my life.  Not even the pepper had any taste.  The whole plate was covered in cheese and mediocre rice and beans.  I did like the small side of guacamole, the only thing I liked at the table.  The service was lackluster and seemed to match up with the food here.    What I did like was that it sits right on a small lake and I would imagine in nicer weather it would be fun to drink margaritas and sit by the water."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for lunch today, as it is close to both our offices. We had never been there, and for good reason after going. The place has an 80's decor, that's the good part. The oil they fry their chips in must be very old because every chip I ate tasted like I was just eating a chunk of lard, literally disgusting. The salsa & bean dip was the best part. I had a beef taco that completely fell apart, and the rice & beans were mush. My friend had the pollo fundido w/unmelted cheese. With in the hour after we left the place, we both got sick w/the runs ( think it was the lard tasting chips).  I came back to work, and my coworker said he went last week , his girlfriend got the pollo fundido burrito (same as my friend), and she literally got food poisoning, hurled7 times ! Wish I would have known before going there! It's expensive too, so not worth it. Not Recommended whatsoever! Some Burros is 100 times tastier & it's fast food!"}
{"text":"Love that Valle Luna sits right on the lake, I enjoy feeding the duckies chips (even though I'm not supposed to) and sitting outside. The food is good, not great, but good. The bean dip is also pretty good, but not as good as serranos. We come here once in a while, but not a place I'd go out of my way for. Like I said, good, but not great."}
{"text":"This place offers consistently good Mexican Food. However, it is kind of hard to compete in Phoenix. The chips, salsa and bean dip was very good. Chips were served hot to our table. Sadly they were out of salsa verde which is totally my favorite part. I ordered the Port Verde which comes with rice and beans. The sides were spot on but the Pork Verde was a bit bland. My friend ordered a combo plate with a tostada, enchilada and crispy taco. Unfortunately, his instructions had been forgotten and the tostada and taco had ingredients on it that he couldn't eat. Portion sizes are good and the server was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Been taking the family for a decade but needs allergy friendly menu items. It's funky decor is fun. I haven't been to happy hour which I hear is fun. Regular hours are family friendly"}
{"text":"I know people who really love this place, so maybe I have visited on a bad day(s) or I am just extra-picky when it comes to my Mexican food. IMO, Valle Luna is just average. Although I admit the service has been good and the ambiance is nice.   On our last visit, we were immediately greeted by a cheerful hostess and taken to a booth along the far side of the wall. Unfortunately the patio was full. If you get a choice, ask for a table outside overlooking the water. It helps the so-so food go down better.   Pros: Big portions, lots of cheese, good service.   Cons: Ho-hum food. Lots of grease. Can be too crowded."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant!  Their food is great with huge portions and LOW prices!  We delayed heading back to TX (where we have MANY) wonderful Mexican restaurants) just so we go eat lunch before leaving!!  Can't wait to come back to the Phoenix area so we can eat here again! Tuesdays they have a BOGO for seniors, in case you are interested. (3-10PM)"}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Great for dinner, great for happy hour, great for Sunday morning breakfast on bar patio.  I love this happy place with friendly staff, great food, relaxed atmosphere.  The restaurant has inside and outside dining as does the bar. Nice view of Lakeshore Condo lake and fountain."}
{"text":"This is really great Mexican food. I have gone there twice now and each time the food has been amazing. The frozen margarita's are also wonderful. The chips and salsa you get on the table are a nice added bonus as well."}
{"text":"Great food! Great specials. We are regulars and we love the staff however on a beautiful day you can't enjoy the patio because of all the smokers. So if you're allergic to smoke this is definitely not the place to go on a beautiful day outside. The only thing we would change is the smoking policy."}
{"text":"Valle is all about the ritas happy hour, chips and bean dip and an awesome patio, if you are looking to eat awesome pollo funditos well they have that too..."}
{"text":"So its Thursday night and I got a certificate from Resturant.com for Valle Luna and thought I haven't been out with the kids in a while wonder if they are up to trying a new place, and guess what, they were, ok when I say kids, I really mean 21, 19, & 16 yr old, yea they are not really kids, but they are my kids :)  It was my 1st time there and I really wanted to like Valle Luna, it's just right up the street from me. I did some research and read some reviews of friends and thought ok, this is going to be a good place!  When we 1st got there they put us in a small booth, we were sitting on top on each other, the 21 yr old is 6 months prego and they placed us in table where it was very tight and making her uncomfortable and I had my left handed son sitting next to me elbowing me already and the food hadn't even arrived yet (s/n: I really think he sits by me to bug the crap out of me) so we asked for a bigger table and we got moved almost into a small booth on the other side, my daughter said yea that's not going to work, that's what the other one was and it hurt to sit there, so we were moved to a table with the view of the lake, it was nice, felt like was in a different area then just chillin in chandler   It was happy hour when I arrived and it was Three-O Thursday, all Three Olive Vodka drinks for 3 bucks, so I ordered the Cherry Smash, it was a pretty drink, but way too strong for me , I know I was even shocked I couldn't finish it!   The chips, bean dip & salsa arrived to the table, now to me the chips were not that bad, tasted ok, some of the reviews said it was the worst part of it, to me they were ok, the salsa on the other hand reminded me of pace picante, one was sweet and the other was just like tomato sauce, packed no heat what so ever, but the kids liked it and ate it.  Ok I'll just tell you what they ordered real quickly:  21yr old ordered the Tamale Dinner, she loves tamales, she thought the flavor was good, tamale itself was a little dry, but it cured her caving.  19 yr old ordered grilled asada burro dinner, she loved it! This plate looks like something I should have ordered, she loved it!  16 yr old ordered southwestern chicken breast, he didn't care for it, he said the chicken tasted like I cooked it, meaning it looked great, but was dry, sometimes I just wanna smack him haha  After reading everyone's reviews, I was really looking forward to what I ordered, I ordered the Fundido, I understood that it was deep fried, but mine looked and tasted like it was left in the fryer for way too long, the tortilla was inedible, I scraped everything out of it and left the shell on another plate.   The beans & rice were good, and so what the filling inside the tortilla, the jalapeno-cream cheese could have had more heat for, but was very good. I don't think I will be ordering this dish again.  We were having a good time talking with each other and decided that we wanted desert, so 2 of us ordered the fried ice cream and one ordered the chocolate taco. I was one of the ones who ordered the fried ice cream and I chose caramel for topping instead of chocolate, and I asked if it could be drowned in caramel and it was ,,omg it was soo delish!!!!!   I do want to come back to Valle Luna to give them another try, the kids did enjoy themselves and the food, so they are willing to go back with me."}
{"text":"Good service and great food.  We always have a great experience going.  Never any issues. We always get coupons from there in the mail for buy one get one and they always honor them."}
{"text":"Came to lunch with on my coworkers that I have not seen in a long time.  We sat in the patio due to nice sweet weather.  The patio tables and chairs are a little dirty.  Service was super slow.  Had to get the server's attention a few times for refills.  The food was ok and little bland.  =("}
{"text":"Ok service, waitress was nice. But she didn't  seem to care once we told here that the food we ordered was dry and was unsatisfactory. All she said was, yeah nothing compares to home made. We ordered the tamales they were dry and had almost no meat in them. Our waitress said they wouldn't be dry if we put the sauce on top. But if your cook could make tamales correctly we shouldn't need sauce to make them moist. The best part of our meal was the rice. We spent 40 for a plate of nasty tamales and good rice. We will never be back. If your smart you will not come here any hole in the wall Mexican restaurant is better than this dump. Too bad really we live close and could have been regular customers."}
{"text":"We had come on a Sunday night and for some bizarre reason a birthday was being held in the bar area.  So with that being said it was impossible to get around to go to the bathroom directly unless you went the long way and then when it came to our food and drinks the older lady that was our server took forever to come over to bring us our food and drinks regardless if it was a soda or water.  Whenever i go to restaurants and am thirsty the servers wont be there to ask if you would like a refill or not. but the days i am not thirsty they are there non stop which is great.  Bad luck maybe.  The chicken tacos were disgusting. The fish tacos apparently were okay. So next time i suppose I should try that instead of the chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years. It's the only restaurant we regularly visit. Service is always great and the food is amazing. Pollo funditto for life!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times before but this time we ordered the taco baskets.  My wife bit into one of the tacos and bit into a 3\" wood stick. She called and spoke to the Manager to explained what happened and all the Manager could say is that they use them to cook the meat and they should have taken it out. She didn't even offer to comp the meal. Be careful and check your tacos before you bite into them because you could choke or lose a tooth. See attached photo of stick."}
{"text":"My daughter and I got there at 8:15 on Friday. We were seated close to the doors to the patio. Restaurant is 60% empty, so I figured we would have great service. Young man came over and gave us the chips and salsa. Then a girl comes over with a high ponytail, says I'm leaving for the night, Gabe will take care of you. She took our drink orders, brought us our drinks moved on to service her tables. About 15 mins later Gabe showed up. I ordered the #2, enchilada/taco rice and beans. I asked if the macacha was really hot. He said, \"It has habaneros in it.\" With sarcasm... I said I wanted green chili chicken enchilada and green chili taco. Oh you can't have green chili on a taco. I said ok, green chili chicken on the enchilada and shredded chicken taco. He repeated me. The busser brought our meals out, gave my plate to my daughter and vice versa (she also ordered a 2 but different meat). We traded and I started digging into the enchilada. It was not chicken, but some pork or beef. I could not eat it. Gabe never came by and I said this is not chicken. Our green chili is pork. I said I asked for chicken. He said, you said green chili. No offer to make it right. No apology for the misunderstanding. I could not eat it. The meat looked gray.  15 mins later, he came by with new drinks and our check. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. If we wanted anything more. For that, he got 3 bucks on a $35 bill. I will NEVER be back! I loved this place when it was in Ahwatukee. No more! I'll go to Si Senor first!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Great staff, great food, the patio view is a jewel, and it's a awesome place to watch a game. Some of my favorites are the Shrimp Chimichanga, Mini Taco Basket, the Fundido and believe it or not, some of the best chicken wings you can get. Order them grilled after fried, so good. Always good times!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at many Mexican cuisine restaurants, but this one is by far the best I have had yet.  Great food & descent service.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good lunch menu, I generally like the Caesar wrap. Do not go unless you have time because service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"Darcie and I dropped by around noon on a Sunday, or what Valle Luna calls Sunday Funday... and it was. We are def going back, and we are excited about it. {Tacos}  Funday happens in the Bar area. Brace for flavor impact: you are entering the awesomely affordable and incredibly delicious zone. Awesome Tomas, the bartender, was welcoming & friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. It's been a week and my mind is still dwelling on.. the tacos. Dude slings cold beer, wine, and eye-openningly tasty salsa and food. {Tacos, tacos}  Call me simple (you wouldn't be the first), but if your Mexican joint has subpar Taco- or Salsa-game... it's a hard pass for me. Fortunately, that's no concern here. {Tacos}  Valle Luna has stellar tacos and salsa. Grab a telescope. Point it to the Heavens and on a clear night you will see them up there. Alternately, just drop by Valle Lune and behold the bounty. Even their mini tacos are substantial. The regular salsa is very tasty, and their hot salsa has a memorably flavorful zing. Holy moley I'm in love with this place. {Tacos... em-effin tacos}  We also got the Bandito Burritos (mini bean burros, deep fried) and a cheese crisp. They were OK. The cheese crisp was more chewy than crisp and I could have done without the deep frying of the little burros. But I was on such a stratospheric high from the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G TACOS that my review is getting all wrapped up in 5-STARS for me. {Oh, the Tacos}  Throughout this review I have liberally strewn a consistent subliminal message that should prep you for your Valle Luna culinary adventure. {T-A-C-O-S}  I envy you the fresh discovery. {haunting whisper... tacos}  Big Thanks to Jesse for getting me Tomas' name. Credit where credit is due baby!"}
{"text":"Been going to Valle Luna literally for years. Good service good food good happy hour.  Tonight was a beautiful AZ night to enjoy happy hour on the patio.  Except the patio was literally full and more then half the guests enjoying the weather were smoking! Aren't there laws about how far away you can smoke? We sat at the table closest to the door! I smelled like smoke when I left as if I was in a smokey bar! GROSS!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance. Service is nice to look at but not exactly proficient. Love the lake view"}
{"text":"This was our favorite neighborhood spot.   Was. The last two times our service has been so terrible it is unbearable. Over thirty minutes to have our order taken. Longer for drinks to be delivered. And a very annoyed condescending server when we asked questions.   There are many places nearby that would be better. We will not be back. So sad to see this place slide into decline."}
{"text":"Had a party for 9 today at lunch. Took 40 mins for our food to arrive. We advised our waiter Harry ahead of time that we were on a work lunch break and if we could get our check with our food. Asked for Togo boxes with our food those never came had to go get them. Our checks were not ready had to wait on. My taco of whole bean rice and lettuce was wrong sent back then still wrong. And for one taco it apparently cost $4.27. When I wanted to changed my form of payment from a card to cash I was snapped at by Harry for messing up his order there were 3 cards there including mine. At no point were we ever apologized too for the late food. A sorry about that would have gone along way. The other girls said the food was good but would never go when your in a hurry.  We were at lunch for a special occasion and it was dampened by the poor services we received!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Mexican food joints. Located a couple miles from home I've come here a few times. Nice atmosphere and the food is quality.   Window seats have a nice view of the lake behind and the style of decor within the restaurant is fitting.   Highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Though the service was slow at the beginning, the place was crowded and had to wait 15 minutes.  Ordered the carna asada steak and my friend ordered the shredded beef chimi, both were really good.  The plates didn't look sloppy but appetizing.  The salsa and chips were also good, they add some herbs to their thick salsa which is pleasant.  Didn't order drinks but they seemed very reasonable.  Rita's for 5 bucks and they looked legit.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I love this place, my friends and I have always come here for their quesadillas. It's always better with chicken. I always take to go their chips, salsa, and bean dip."}
{"text":"I love to go to Valle Luna for girls lunch out dates. Great Margs and  lunch prices. I also almost always use a Restaurants.com gift cards and NEVER have any problems. I wish it was closer to my house but the drive is so worth it. Portions are great and the never ending chips are well ... never ending! Bar atmosphere is fun and as a whole this place is very clean. On the occasional day it gets chilly here in Phoenix I head right to this place for the fabulous Albondigas soup. Warms me right up. Keep up the great work Valle Luna!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot, but haven't in several months (probably close to a year) and now I remember why!  Taco was over cooked to the point that it completely fell apart when I picked it up.  When I told the waitress she said that most people order them soft not crunchy because they are so brittle. The tostada was a soggy mess!  My mom ordered the burro de la casa and it was so greasy and the cheese had hardened so much by time it was delivered that it was almost completely inedible. The tea tasted like it had been sitting for 3 or 4 days. Overall a very bad food experience from a place we use to love."}
{"text":"Not the same as it used to be. There is no longer complimentary bean dip and it's not even the same recipe. Total bummer and disappointment."}
{"text":"Ughhhh!! go anywhere else but here! food was bland bland bland and horribly greasy! not a fresh item to be had. It was like drunk college food only worse.  It takes some serious work to mess up tacos rice and beans in my opinion but Valle Luna more than succeeded. Way too overpriced for the junk they serve. All I wanted were two veggie tacos and i got the greasiest hard tacos ever that were falling apart with refried beans from a can and not a vegetable to be had. Rice was tasteless and horribly mushy. We will never be back. Honestly I wish that I had complained but our server was too nice and we were so intent on leaving that I just did not...save your wallet and your stomachs and skip Valle Luna!!"}
{"text":"We went to the bar and our bartender was one of the best servers I have ever experienced. He was very attentive and friendly. Shrimp tacos where delish, cod in the grilled fish tacos not as good. Atmosphere was fun and friendly and festive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have visited this place countless times over 2 yrs...but I'm sad to say I won't return ..the staff is gotten really bad... I don't know if the hiring pool is just awful or this place hires good employees and just have the worst leadership....the 2nd is the food used to be good .... used to be..maybe they are going through tuff financial Times or they are under new owners/management,  either way the food is now bland and the quality falls below Taco bell ( at least you know what your getting with taco bell) ...last time I was there the bartender spent more time with his buddies than taking care of paying customers and worse management didn't care.... my overall advice is to stay away...I would have given them a worse Rating but 1* is all they get....Try    DOS gringos or Nando's If in  Chandler..."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and give Valle Luna four stars.  Why? Because I like their thin-cut chips and spicy bean dip, lakeside dining and sea bass that comes with a unique concoction of sauteed vegetables, rice and decent jalapeno lime cream sauce.  The best menu item I've ordered (which I coincidentally don't order anymore because I fear the calories) is the South of the Border pollo sandwich. The chicken is soft, flavorful, and the green chile slice gives it a true southwestern ring. Make sure you get the requisite avocado slices.  One complaint is the drink prices - unless you sit in the (usually busy) bar side of the restaurant, a semi-decent margarita might run $7 or $8. I guess I'm spoiled, paying $3 for a margarita at Salty Senoritas.  Sometimes, I've felt the service was a little under par. A lack of warmth and friendliness, maybe? But most of the waiters/hostesses are young and perhaps don't consider this a career, so I don't blame them for not being perky.  I should note - my family loves this place, and they tend to be picky about Mexican food and atmosphere. Considering the other reviews I've seen about Valle Luna, I'm not sure why my family is so entranced with it. But it has become our hangout each time I'm in the southeast Valley."}
{"text":"Now I must admit that this place holds some nostalgia for me. It is where me and my fianc√© had our first date.  We have been back a few times since then and it's been okay at times, good at others. Tonight was pretty darn good. The atmosphere of this restaurant is nice especially if you get seated by the lake view tables. I have to say I was a little bit turned off that we were given dirty menus from the hostess stand. Someone was slacking. Salsa all over. But the service and food did make up for it.  We had a buy one get one free entr√©e coupon which was happily honored. Our waiter was very nice and kept our drinks refilled and checked in with us often. I had a cheese enchilada and a chicken flauta. My fianc√© had a shredded beef and bean burrito. Both meals were very tasty. The enchilada sauce was great. The enchilada had just the right amount of cheese.   We had a good overall experience. There may be a few other Mexican restaurants in town that are a little better but I enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend Valle Luna."}
{"text":"Good tacos and price but it was missing a little more variety and parking isn't the best. Good margs"}
{"text":"I went for dinner after not having visited for over a year. I recalled why I stopped going. The chips were burned and I had to ask to have them replaced. They stopped giving bean dip with the chips. And when I got my food it was lukewarm and tasted like fast food. I used to like this place 20 years ago but it is not the same now. Will not be going back unless it is for happy hour."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the state. I've been a fan since 1989."}
{"text":"Decided to order a platter for a going away lunch for a coworker got the platter that feeds 12 but i think it's more like ten. Everything to serve the mini tacos taquitos and burritos along with beans and rice is included except for plates. The food was great and everyone commented how spicy the machaca was."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the pretty lake at Valle Luna and the outdoor patio, I probably wouldn't ever go there. Their food is mediocre. The corn taco shells have been shiny with grease on the last 3-4 visits. The service for three of us at 1:00 PM today (Monday) was extremely slow. We were on our second basket of tortilla chips when our food finally arrived. The $5 house margarita lacked flavor; very disappointing. Didn't care for the black olives in the cheese enchiladas. The best time to go there is when you have a buy one entree, get one free."}
{"text":"I have been Valle Luna in the past and was not very happy with the food and service.  I said I would never go back yet, I decided to give it another try this time when I had friends in town. Once again completely disappointed with the food and service.  I had called ahead to make reservations for a party of 6 and was told they only accept reservations for 8 or more. Okay, I let that one go. We get to Valle Luna the waiting area is not busy at all. I place my name and party size with the host. He did not give me a wait time, just says,\" okay, have a seat.\" We waited 30 minutes before I finally had to approach the young man to ask how much longer. He said, \"we are still waiting for tables to clear.\" We wait another 5 minutes then  finally are taken back to our table. First we are seated next to a table with a family with 4 kids, all of which were behaving badly running around screaming, no one said a word to the parents or kids.  Our waitress, Krystle promptly comes to our table to take our drink orders. This is when her poor waiting skills come into play. Krystle never approached us with a smile, a hello, welcome, just a \"what would everyone like to drink.\" She returns with our drink then asks if everyone is ready to order. We all order. I personally had the spinach enchiladas. They were not good to say the least. The description mentions the enchiladas being filled with spinach, tomatoes, potato and zucchini in a blend of cheeses. These enchiladas should have been called cheese enchiladas, that is what they mostly consisted of. I saw the finely chopped pieces of spinach amongst the cheese sauce. However, I never once tasted or saw a potato, tomato or zucchini at any time while eating this dish. It was very bland and again I felt as if I was eating a tortilla filled with Velveeta cheese sauce. My husband and friends were not entirely pleased with their meals either. They all said that the food was okay but too pricey for the quality.  Back to our waitress, Krystle. The worst waitress I have ever encountered while dining out. She could have been more pleasant, and attentive. We had to flag her down on more than one occasion for drink refills, extra salsa, etc. Each time we asked her for something she acted as if we were inconveniencing her. We didn't receive even a thank you from Krystle at the end of our meal. I will NEVER go back to Valle Luna and will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday til 6pm... awesome for sure! Good deals on drinks... and food. It's in the bar only. But still totally legit. It was dark in the booth we were sitting in though, damn if I can't read a menu now and I'm only 27 what does that say about my future in a dark booth... anyone know of a good lasik eye surgeon... lol?!?!"}
{"text":"In December, would have given them 5 stars for happy hour.  In January they doubled their prices and stopped the bean dip.  We had been going weekly and now not at all. The drinks are watered down and the quality has plummeted while the prices rise. So sad. We have been going here for 10 years."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can eat at this place! The food is disgusting; bland, overly salted, and greasy are the best words to describe the 4 dishes my party ordered (and that includes a taco salad)! The meat on it smelled like dog food. I assumed when I paid extra for steak it was going to be big decent pieces. Nope. It was like weird Taco Bell meat cut into tiny cubes the size of raisins. In all honesty I should have just gone TO Taco Bell instead of wasting money on this food- especially since the dressing I asked for on the side came in a plastic take out container. When I am paying to sit down, please don't serve me anything in crappy plastic containers. The margaritas were terrible as well! Watered down, way too sweet, and pretty much see through. I also asked for a salted rim and was given this weird sugar mixture on it instead. This overly sweet drink they tried to pass off for a margarita might work well at a sorority house but not as a restaurant that boasts being voted the top Mexican Food in 2014. My two thoughts on that:  1) According to who (because whoever decided that doesn't have tastebuds) and 2) HOLY CRAP how Valle Luna has gown down hill in just 2 short years."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome atmosphere great music in the bar area big flat screen tvs with all sports good cold drinks and amazing hot food"}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food! The Milton margarita tasted like an old dish rag .  My wife ordered a taco salad and when it came to the table it had an inch of water in the bottom of the bowl. To top it off the waitress basicly threw our food down on the table probably was mad she had to serve such garbage."}
{"text":"Been coming to Valle Luna for years and have always enjoyed both the food and the service.  Today I ordered the Fundido and it was quite dry so I asked for a little bit of Sour Cream I help correct the problem rather than send the food back.  Much to my surprise, I was charged extra for the Sour Cream.  So when I pointed out to my Server, Bree, that I was being charged for their mistake, not a word was muttered.  Just handed me the bill.    Bree has ended my patronage of Valle Luna."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I filled up a survey with my contact information. I was never contacted by management. My waitress Krysten was horrible. She was always on a rush, never brought to the table what i asked for, and presented the wrong check to me. Never going back here."}
{"text":"My Dad and I went here for dinner tonight. It had been a stressful day, but Seth helped changed that. He was super attentive and carried with him a fun and positive vibe. He was simply the best server I've ever had here! Thank you Seth for helping turn my night around. You were such a blessing tonight! I hope management gives you the recognition you deserve! If you choose to dine here, please request Seth if he is working. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna isn't the best, most authentic Mexican food in the land, but it's plenty good enough for those that don't know any better. I've only visited for happy hour, but always leave with a happy tummy after chowing down on spicy chips and salsa, margaritas,and half-priced appetizers.  I'm particularly fond of this location because of the sweet lakeside view. Its beauty at sunset combined with the savings from coupons they repeatedly send in the mail are reason enough to return for more.  HH is 3-7:30 M-F and 12-6 on Sat. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My fav Mexican cantina in Chandler! chicken taco basket and the Luna-Rita are the best!"}
{"text":"Sue had the spinach enchiladas and I had the fajitas. Both meals came out quickly, they were hot, fresh with just enough spices. Our waitress, Erin, was friendly, attentive, and professional. Look for coupons, they always have a BOGO out there. But, be sure you take care of your server and tip on the full amount!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend love this place. Much better than the other local chains. Its a pretty nice atmosphere and all ages seem to go here. One of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I am writing this review because our server last night needs to be recognized for how he took care of us.  We were a last minute party of 30 and Christian was assigned to take care of us.  In all of my years and all of my different restaurant visits I have never experienced service like we had last night.  We always receive great care when dining at Valle Luna but I am still amazed and we haven't stopped talking about Christian!  All 30 of us ordered cocktails, dinners, split dinners, kids dinners and separate checks.  In other words, we weren't an easy table.  Christian did not miss a beat!   Drinks were refilled and ordered before current ones were empty, all orders came out correct and not a single bill was wrong!  I still don't know how he accomplished this!  To top it all off, one of the kids fell out of his chair and Christian had an ice pack to our table minutes after getting him back in his seat!  We were stunned!  We didn't even ask for it!! We often receive great service here but we have NEVER had service like this.  Managers, please give Christian kudos for a job well done and tell him how valuable he is to your establishment!  Thank you Valle Luna and thank you Christian!  The Thomas/Felice family!"}
{"text":"The food is good (thumbs up for the taco salad) but the view is awesome. Sitting out on the patio & gazing out at the lake makes the meal that much better. The last time I was there we couldn't get lakeside seating because of a quincea√±era. Because of the view, it's an excellent place for parties, meetings, etc. I believe they also have karaoke."}
{"text":"Besides being my husbands favorite place, this place is downright delicious! Great prices, great atmosphere, and great service. Even during a rush they manage to make diners feel like it's empty and you have their undivided attention. We look forward to date nights as it's our usual spot!"}
{"text":"Good margaritas and the patio is nice most of the year. The complimentary bean dip is awesome but for the most part the food is fair. My go-to dishes here are the pollo fundito or fish tacos, they have whole pinto beans as a side and they are amazing. Service is hit or miss, the buy one get one coupon in the circular is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Valle Luna Chandler  My wife and I were kid free the other night and were deciding where to go and deducted down to Valle Luna because of the lakeside setting. We got there and parked in the lot and the very first thing you see in the front parking lot is an overflowing open gated nasty dumpster with boxes and rotton food spewing out. We nearly turned around and said S@REW THIS, but we didn't.  Inside we asked the host for patio seating which she said was booked; however, there was first-come-first-serve on the bar patio. Scored a ringside seat next to the lake! Yippie! I'm so gettin' some tonight with this setting. However, the ambiance was really marred by 2 things. First was the wafting of clouds of cigarette smoke lofting into our serene spot. Ewww, not to be a hypocrite as I smoked like 12 years ago..no check that cigarettes are gross. The other issue was the EXTREMELY INTOXICATED middle aged foul mouthed trashy cougar hooker seated behind us. Her and her skank girlfriend sat down about 1/2 hour after we did and she was friggin' hammered upon being seated. She later exclaimed to her friend about how she'd been drinking wine ALL DAY...yea really, you handle and hide it well. I totally shook my head as I watched the server dude take her order and thought, \"Dude you're not really going to serve that sloshy puddle more booze are you?\" and he did - and multiple times. Unbelievable! Where's the Liquor Board when they're needed.   The other issue about the facility is the stank in the bar area. It has the aroma of a high school boys locker room. They really need to address this as it's nasty...carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned this millennium.   You can't go wrong drinking a Corona Light in this atmoshere and my wife had a Don Julio Blanca Marg Rocks that was good to. Later she prdered teh same but with a Chambord shot in it...awesome drink!  My wife loves that they serve a bean dip with the chips and I thought the salsa was very tasty and chunky. I hate it when the salsa is watery thin. Chips were good ny wife said as I don't eat them.   My wife had red cili enchiladas that were just ok...nothing special. I was pleased to see sea bass on the menu...yea! Ordered it but the server forgot to ask me which of the 2 sauces I wanted or about the sides. I flagged him down and told him the sauce and also said that I didn't want any rice. Food comes, there's the friggin' rice all over my plate. I'm not really picky but seriously I asked specifically for no rice and there it is and it's not like you can just push it aside as it crosses the international borders into the veggies, beans and fish sauce...forced to have a re-make. 8 minutes later and my wife is 1/2 done and here it comes back out. Looks good...taste is stone cold...what a shame as it was a good looking piece of fish.   Without that lake...we would never come back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food restaurant in AZ! We have had some ups and downs over the past couple decades almost, but more ups than downs. The downs have been fixed in, in my opinion. Gabe is the man and has probably been serving us for 7 years by now. They have the best tacos in the state. It feels like you are with family when you are there after all these years."}
{"text":"Recently I decided to have a surprise birthday party for my girlfriend, and being that she and most of her friends are Mexican I wanted a place with good food. She is from Sonora, and the restaurant is described as Sonoran-style, so I put it at the top of my list.  I spoke to someone a few weeks prior who gave me additional information on private parties. They offer three different levels of menus for large parties. In selecting the Sonoran Celebration I picked two menu items and it came with rice, beans, a zucchini dish, and chips & salsa. Unlimited soda, tea, and coffee also come with that option. I had half of the patio overlooking the lake, booked it for 5pm with dinner served at 6.   I arrived a little early and had the opportunity put up decorations and set up the cakes I brought. While I was doing that two staff members were busy setting up the food line and brought me drinks. As the guests arrived they were offered drinks and chips & salsa while the food was being prepared.   The setting was perfect, my girlfriend surprised, and everyone reported having a good time. They enjoyed the food and as I booked for 35 but didn't have quite that many show up there were some leftovers that we brought home. It was a good choice (thanks to those Yelpers who provided suggestions on my Talk post), and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and excellent food! Our server was great even though the hostesses seemed a little behind. It was senior night (50+) and the special is either buy one get one free or, since there was only 1 senior at our table, 50% off his entree. I had the Fundito which was very rich and pretty salty, but was still delicious! I also loved the interior set up of the restaurant, and can't complain about the view of the lake right outside! The only thing I disliked about Valle Luna was the salsa."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting and we were planning on going to Pita Jungle next door but the wait was 30 mins. So we popped over here and was seated immediately.  Over the service was really good. I had a chicken taco salad and it was really fresh, definitely will get this next time I come back.  The only thing I didn't like was the water was out of the tap and tasted gross.  I guess I'm a water snob. Lol"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here for my dad's birthday. Service was excellent and so was the food. They serve bean dip and salsa with chips both were very yummy. Their margaritas are excellent.   I had a green pork burrito with beans and rice. Everything was super tasty. My daughter had the cheese crisp extravaganza which she loves...has tons of steak and grilled vegetables. Their Polo Fundito is also excellent, the cream cheese sauce is perfect, not too hot. Really didn't have anything bad. Servings are huge so you will have leftovers for lunch the next day!!   There is a lovely outdoor patio that would be really nice when the weather is cooler.   Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently took out-of-town visitors to Valle Luna based on our past experience of it being a great local spot with great food, but I doubt we will return after our newest experience. We arrived just prior to the evening rush, and were quite surprised by the staff's lack of prioritization skills as we sat in the entry at least 15 minutes while others who arrived after us requiring seating for 5 were seated before us. When we inquired about this, the hostess proceeded to seat us near the smelly restroom, with other suitable booths in plain sight. Unfortunately, the odor overshadowed any quality of food that may have been there. Needless to say, my husband and I were mortified by the staff's haphazard treatment, especially since we had recommended the restaurant so highly to our guests. Valle Luna used to be our favorite local spot, but I doubt it will be on our short list of preferred places to go the next time we are asked to recommend a restaurant. We are very disappointed since that evening was to be the last get together before one of our guests deploys to Afghanistan."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so it's hard to let me down and Valle Luna definitely didn't! The spinach enchiladas were super tasty and I was so glad to be able to find so many vegetarian options. The location is really cool and we nabbed a table overlooking the water so we had a super great night. You can tell that this is a neighborhood place by all the groups of friends gathered and having a great time. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent mouthwatering original chimichanga burrito! They are stuffed fat and will leave you with a belly that will be full for the rest of the evening! Their ingredients are fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials.  Great food and yummmmy food. Wednesday has family night specials."}
{"text":"Great drink prices and good food. Our server Erin was awesome she was 5 stars without a doubt the kind of server you always want and expect"}
{"text":"Our server came over to us twice. Once when we arrive and then once after our food was delivered. He otherwise ignored us the whole time. We had to get another waitress to help us out.   The chips and salsa were okay. The food was large portions, with okay flavors. Was disappointed overall with the experience and food and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Staff was very friendly and efficient. Food was great. Will be back in the fall to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Big Fan. . .   I have been here numerous times throughout the years and can't believe i never wrote a review sooner.  I love this place.  This location is excellent.  It sits right on the water so when the weather is nice the patio seating cannot be beat.   Every time I have been here the service is always excellent.     The food is great.  I usually order the Machaca Burro De la Casa with rice a beans and each time I am left satisfied.  Also just in case you prefer Black beans instead of Pinto or Re-fried.  Those are very good as well and have become my preferred choice of late.    For me personally this is one of the better Mexican Restaurants in the area and I would much rather drive here then each at Nandos which is closer to my home.    The only downside for others who have been here in past years. . They used to offer you bean dip with your chips and salsa, but not anymore.  Now they will charge you $4.00 as if its an appetizer dish and while it is good, for me it isn't' worth it.   Other than that, enjoy the food and the view."}
{"text":"4 stars if you want a greasy heart attack. I often do, so I get the grilled pork chimichanga, I think it only has 7,000 calories.  Patio is awesome as long as you don't let ducks bully you into feeding them your delicious chips. (Beer doesn't help this). Down to 3 stars because the Sangria sucks, should be called a fruit juice meltdown, blech."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican food restaurant that seems very popular with the Chandler crowd. It serves tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and other typical selections that Americans have come to believe originated south of our border. The food tastes good, but then again, I'm a sucker for most things covered in sour cream and cheese. It's definitely a step closer to legit Mexican food than some other places, but there's really not much here that you can't get anywhere else.  I will give a thumbs up on the happy hour. Great deals on appetizers and drinks make it worth the stop if you're in the area. Give it a look see."}
{"text":"This location was nice we went on Valentine's Day wasn't too busy was nice to see the view of the water it was a rainy night my now fianc√© had ordered the fajitas there were more onions then there was chicken he was very disappointed however I liked the fundio that I ordered it was very tasty the chips and salsa are yummy kind of spicy but good. We would go back to this location but I think that he won't order the fajitas again he was disappointed The four pieces of chicken and a whole big old pile of onions."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. Only thing is they didn't have refried beans that were on menu. But service was amazing, drinks were on point and food was so good. It's beautiful to sit on patio and enjoy your food with the view of lke and waterfall"}
{"text":"Tasty food, good prices.  Great lunch destination.  Even the 'lunch special' portions are on the large side, all you can eat chips and salsa / bean dip while you wait for the meal (won't be long).  Try the lunch chimichanga special with green Chile, rice & beans, it's a piece of heaven on a plate."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Portions large. What pissed me off is that to get the \"Sunday Funday\" deals you have to sit in the bar or bar patio--smoky and awful. I cannot be around smoke. We had to sit at the far west end of the restaurant patio to avoid the smoke blowing over from the bar patio. So apparently we must risk lung cancer to get the discounts. Because of that I won't go back. I experienced breathing problems when we sat inside the restaurant a few months ago so that is not an option. Why can't anyone get the discounts even if they are not in the bar or bar patio? Isn't that discrimination? Parking is always horrible there too."}
{"text":"I've been going to valley Luna since I was 8 years old! I usually go to the one on cave creek road and when I moved to chandler I was thrilled to find one in my neighborhood. The patio is beautiful. And the chips and salsa are to die for. Make sure to ask for hot sauce I like to mix the mild salsa with the hot. Favorite is tia Rita's tacos plate or the green chili cheese Crisp yummmm"}
{"text":"Red chille Carne is the best. Every Wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eat for 1.50. Such a great deal and it is very filling. The food is always fresh and hot when they sever you. Bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive, um I'm good. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good salsa. However, beef fajitas had hardly any beef in them. I was out of sour cream and other extras, but the waitress didn't ask if I wanted more."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around love it great service best place around they have the best service and the best food try the spinach enchiladas there they're the bomb the waitress I don't know her name she's been there forever she is fantastic I love having her every time I go there I wish I knew her name but we sit on the patio every time we go and she's always our server 90% of the time and she is just fantastic and the food is the bomb I give A5 star rating"}
{"text":"Service was not good. The waiter (Ariel) asked me for my ID (which I'm always flattered to hear) and as I go to my purse to get it he says \"I'm not kidding\". That was a bit uncomfortable considering I didn't think he was joking. I ordered shrimp tacos with flour tortillas because I do not like corn and I still got corn. He could not remember our drink order and came over 3 times instead of just writing it down. The drinks were strong but not good. The food was not worth the price. I would much rather go to Abuelo's where we are never disappointed. I would not recommend this place. My family and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"THE ONLY PLACE I GO TO FOR MEXICAN!  Let me start off first by saying that there is a server that works there named Jill and she is like this precious, sweet, wonderful lady who ALWAYS knows what me and my boyfriend want when she see's us! We just love her so much! She ROCKS!  The staff there seem to have worked there for a long time which always says a lot to me. The chips and salsa are good - but the bean dip? Oh man! I am in love with their bean dip! The atmosphere is really nice and the view is really nice to (over looks a little man made pond with a fountain in the middle.). Me and my boyfriend always order the same thing - the minnie taco basket, beef, with no tomatoes - and we always walk out stuffed and happy. They use shredded beef that is so juicy and flavorful!   Sometimes I am disappointed with the wait staff because certain servers aren't really on top of things, even on a slow day. But, my boyfriend and I don't let that impede out love for the minnie tacos and delicious bean dip!  I will be a patron for forever (or least until I don't live in Phoenix anymore)!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a year and a half, about 2-3 times a week.  I have learned not to expect good service or good quality of food.  I came back always because of the patio.  But as far as service, it is lack luster at best, as you can see by other reviews.  We sat there for about 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged by our server who walked by several times.  We placed an order for Carne Asada nachos with drinks.  When we were eating the nachos we realized there was almost no chunks of meat on them, which cost $15 for nachos.  The cuts of meat were 1/8 inch in size and a very sparring amount. I considered this meat dust.  When telling the waiter this he just said that is the way it comes.  So the manager came over and as this was discussed it became apparent he didn't care either.  He wanted to take a whole $5 off the bill.  Maybe if I was back in Junior High $5 would have been a big deal.  I don't go out for a celebration and get concerned over $5.  What I am concerned about is the dining experience I have.  This place will always be busy, cheap drinks, average food and a good view.  So this won't make a difference in who goes there.  But this is the only recourse in having yet another bad dining experience here, for which I became accustomed to. I will attempt to find another Mexican restaurant to enjoy going out to.  I know, I only have about 300 other options."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. I went for the first time with a group 2 months ago and every time anyone suggest meeting for dinner or lunch I always suggest here. They have really good enchiladas and you cant beat a $5 margaritas on Fridays."}
{"text":"my husband and my two small children decided to try out this Mexican Restaurant last night. We waiting for 25 minutes to get a table, which is understandable. We walked around the beautiful view of the lake while we were waiting which was really nice. Once we were seated, we decided to order some drinks and appetizers. We went for what we thought was \"happy hour\" to enjoy 1/2 price apps and reduced priced drinks, but we were told by the waitress you could not order from that menu at a table, only at the bar. As we were eating we noticed it was getting really warm. When we asked the waitress she said the air condition was broke. My husband asked why we weren't told by the hostess, because we may have decided to go elsewhere. She didn't have an answer and proceeded to get a manager. The manager was very rude and was trying to tell us that she thought the temp was fine. It was definitely not fine. We were sweating at the table. We weren't trying to get anything for free, we had already paid the bill. We were just looking for an explanation. We left very unsatisfied. We probably will go back because the food was ok, and the location is very close to our house. But if we had similar poor service after our next visit, we would definitely not go back a third time."}
{"text":"This restaurant has THE best food. I got hooked on their Mexican pizza awhile back and now have a real addition. Their dips are amazing as well. Would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place since before the one in ahwatukee shut down several years ago... Food is consistently great but I'm really sad they took away the free bean dip!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed. I've been to the Valle Luna in the West Valley several times and thought it was good, so I finally went to the East Valley location. When I am rating a Mexican food restaurant always base it on chips, tacos, and enchiladas. First, the chips tasted over done. Second, the tacos were fairly tasteless and fell apart because the shell was drenched. Third, the enchiladas has black olives. I'm an Arizona native and have had Mexican food a couple of times and I don't recall of many places putting olives in their enchiladas.   In the end I may go back, but it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"My friend loves going here, the food is just food. Nothing to great, it's a nice place to hang out and drink at during happy hour though. Parking can be a pain but I love sitting outside, having a few drinks and watching the sun set. The food is just average bar like food but I enjoy their happy hour prices."}
{"text":"There's different kinds of Mexican places around.    Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.)  Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)  Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)  Type D: \"Mexican Denny's\" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.)   Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)  Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.  It's visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  It's the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly.  Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker.  Valle Luna means good Mexifood.  If you're in the mood for a Type D, bypass the \"Fresh Mex\" and come here."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment at Valle Luna. Great food and great atmosphere. Bean dip and salsa are absolutely delicious and the margaritas are even better. Never had a meal there I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"We've been going to Valle Luna on and off for years.    The last time that we ate there, we were less than pleased.  The food was bland, the sauces all tasted the same.  I ordered tamales, my favorite, they were as hard as rocks, so dense and heavy and unpleasant.  The rice was blah.  My daughter decided that rather than order from the kids meal, she would order a 1/2 price happy hour appetizer.  The happy hour menu was standing up in the middle of the table for all to see.  When we tried to order off the appetizer menu, we were told that those items could only be ordered in the bar and that the server was unable to accomodate us.  I decided to go into the bar and order the appetizer to bring back to our table.  On the upside, the bartender was very helpful and said that it was fine, nothing worng with bringing it back to our table and then offered to bring it to us when it was done!  So helpful!   We were very  disappointed that the server was so unwilling to help us solve the problem.    We went home with tons of leftovers because none of us thought the food was any good.  Don't know why we took it home, it just ended up in the trash.   I guess we'll continue our quest to find the best Mexican food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the weighted average is 3 stars, this place is a Chandler cornerstone restaurant. Wife & I always have a great time when we go. Salsa & bean dip incredible, entrees to die for (fundido & steak fajitas this time). Attentive staff. Margaritas pretty good. A little pricier that I would have hoped, but the waterfront helps justify. Shop local."}
{"text":"This spot is a staple of mine and my family's, along with many of our friends.  A really fun, really neat bar with a great vibe.  Tons of locals come into the place and much of the staff are on a first name basis.  The drinks are great - try the blue margaritas.  The food is INCREDIBLE - try the taco basket (chicken and beef combo) and the wings are legit (try them grilled).  The location is great, you can hang out on the back patio right next to the lake.  A really fun place to watch games - especially for Cards fans on Sunday.  Excellent happy hour and the actually just remodeled so the bar area is a lot more open and welcoming. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Took long time to take order. Food doesn't taste good. I ordered veggie fajita and veggies were just steamed. No spice nothing. Not going to come again. Avoid."}
{"text":"Greasy \"traditional\" American Mex is not really my cup of tea, so I would not usually choose this type of place for that reason.  However, I'm a medical sales rep, and we bring A Lot of lunches to offices.  Usually I try and steer them towards healthier fare since I have to eat lunch too, but one of my better accounts had a particular fancy for this place so I decided to be accommodating and give it a whirl.    I ordered their party platter which feeds 25, and told them to just put an assortment of stuff on there, beef and chicken.  My total was $125 before tax, and I found this to be EXTREMELY reasonable for what I got.  They were a little slow getting my order brought out to my car, but yes, they did bring it out and load it up and I only gave them an hour notice so I won't fault them for this at all.  It was a TON of food, two huge bags of chips, 3 large containers of salsa, 1 large container of guac, 1 large container of sour cream, a tray of rice, another tray of beans, and 3 huge party platter assortments of mini chimis, mini tacos, and flautas.  Even though the food was fried, it was not terribly greasy, and I actually enjoyed it!  It was a huge hit with the office, and there was so much leftover I actually brought some back for the staff at one of my offices since coincidentally they were having Mexican potluck day and as usual, I forgot to bring something in.  They commented on how good it was too, even though it was a full hour later and I looked super thoughtful ;)  I would definitely recommend this place for other reps who do catering orders or anyone who wants to feed a large group for what I consider to be a very fair price.  Huge hit, something for everyone!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me and my girls to this place 2 years ago. It became one of our Go To Places. The service, for the most part, was mediocre. Chasing your waiter to come take your order or get drinks isn't my ideal of great customer service. But we loved going because of the patio sitting and their delicious bean dip which used to be FREE! I understand times are hard and can't always have things for free but to start charging your customer $4.25 for a bean dip, it better come in a large bowl that feeds more than 3 people! If anything, there should be free refills! Otherwise change your price. I never knew refried beans were so costly! You're better off ordering your meal which gives you their rice and beans...and not waste your money on the $4.25 over charged bean dip.  #MediocreService #WhatWasOnceFree #OverPricedBeanDip #ValleLuna"}
{"text":"A great traditional Mexican restaurant.  5 star decor and views of an older Dobson Ranch lake area.  Service was 5 star.  2 or 3 combo deals Mex and Match are a good deal.   The tortilla soup is the best secret.   Get it as your side.  Ground beef burrito was just ok.  It was bland, even as I ordered enchilada style, I wish it had more sauce and cheese.   Cilantro lime dressing was weak on the salad switched to cilantro ranch.  The kids combo is huge.  Kids bean burro was small.  Side of fruit was just grapes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love this place. The food is good, drink specials and service is always great. We come here once a month, the location is perfect with views of the water from the patio! They also have specials if you use foursquare you can get $ off your bill."}
{"text":"Get their special magaritas. And the free bean dip is amazing...  This is my new favorite local joint. As for food not the greatest if you are looking for authentic mexican. And it is not spicy at all....  But this is my new spot. Dibbs."}
{"text":"Ick.  I must also have visited on a bad day.  Valle Luna serves up by far the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten.  And I've eaten Mexican food in Connecticut.  That's saying something.  I think the best part was the bean dip (I think it was beans) they serve with their chips.  There was nothing memorable after that.  The best and really only good thing about Valle Luna is its location.  It sits right on the Anderson Springs \"waterfront\" so if you can get the patio, go for it."}
{"text":"We drove about 30 minutes to have dinner here and should have saved the fuel. This spot was a favorite for my wife's family growing up. It took about 45 minutes to get our meal. On arrival my order was incorrect. The children's plates were excessively hot-not sure why you would hand a 4 year old a plate they could burn them self on?!  The servers were friendly and apologetic of the length of time it took. Overall, the food wasn't worth the drive. We will find a new local favorite for our family that is closer to where we live and that tastes better."}
{"text":"Craving Mexican food... stopping by is a must. Service was outstanding, refilled drinks without noticing...lol. Not to mention Happy Hour Specials were great! No skimping customers on food(fish tacos=$3) and margaritas are . Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"i enjoyed the visit.  the lake was a pleasant surprise.  went for lunch and ordered the 1 entry with rice and beans with fried ice cream.  i thought everything was yummy and filling.  the ice cream was topped with carmel!  would go back."}
{"text":"The Sonoran enchilada and shredded beef chimichanga covered in red enchilada sauce are exceptional. The ground beef chimichanga enchilada style is also very good. My girl let me try her Mexican Pizza and that was delicious, too. The Sonoran Enchilada is one of my favorites besides the chimichangas. The complimentary chips and salsa are also better than most Mexican joints."}
{"text":"While this place is kinda pricey they're queso fundido is amazing!!!  The wife and I love the amount of cheesy goodness they put on all their food.  The rice, beans, and service was perfect.  Wish you guys would put one down here in Tucson since I'd frequent it all the time!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was lacking. Our drinks didn't come for at least 20 min+ and could not find our waiter when needed. Views were nice of the lake and atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with family and didn't break the bank. Great margaritas! We also had an EXCELLENT waiter named Mason!! Can't say enough good things about him."}
{"text":"This is my parents' go-to place to enjoy a sangarita and beer on weekends. I went this past weekend and we just ordered appetizers. Food is okay and the service can be a hit or a miss. I will say that this past weekend the waitress did take care of us. But I've gone other times where service wasn't the best.  Their spicy salsa is actually pretty good considering I'm used to eating pretty authentic spicy salsa. I enjoy their cheese crisp and nachos here. Not a bad place to go to!"}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food, but cool atmosphere. Tacos come in hard shells, the Verde salsa is average. The do have a great happy hour, lots of TVs in the bar area. If you are trying to stay on a budget, this happy hour is a great deal! If you want good food, perhaps not the best pick. Ambiance is a typical Mexican-American restaurant. Flip Flops, shorts and t shirt. They do have a cool patio area on a urban lake."}
{"text":"The service was average but the food saved this from being a three star review. We were a demanding table of 5 (MORE BEAN DIP!!!@!) but our waiter and help were able to keep up. All in all, we had about three rounds of chips and dip before our food came. It felt a little long, but it was worth the wait. Dinner arrived sizzling hot and everybody enjoyed their food. The shrimp fajitas need more shrimp and less onions taking up room on the plate (sneaky sneaky). Good salsa, great bean dip, and delicious enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife and sister.  I'm a big fan of Mexican restaurants, and this place did not disappoint. The chips were served with bean dip and salsa, both of which were good. They stayed on top of refills as well.  Ordered the house margarita on the rocks, which was also delicious. Very strong as well, be careful!  I had the chicken Chimichanga which was delicious and a generous portion... it was so large but also delicious that I was still full when dinner rolled around the next evening...  I also enjoyed the nice lake view. Was not able to sit next to it but added to the atmosphere. Overall would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Had 2 ground beef taco platter with rice & black beans, never got the beans, rice was dry and the amount of ground beef fill was a joke. No brainer why they're fighting Prop 206...never again, never again"}
{"text":"I had heard about this restaurant from some neighbors and certainly have passed by it many times. Finally I decided to stop by for lunch during the weekend. I arrived after the lunch rush and the place was nice and tidy. The d√©cor, tables and booths are very outdated and the dim lighting doesn't help. I was seated in a booth by the window overlooking the outside patio and pond, nice view.   I ordered the chicken fundido with refried beans and rice. The chicken was grilled, nice taste, but the tortilla was over cooked. The beans and rice were what you would expect. The chips and salsa were pretty good but I've had better.   After my meal I wondered about and found the bar area, seemed nice but a little tight seating and yes they had lighting a plenty.   Overall, not a bad experience but not so memorable either. They really need a makeover in their d√©cor, very outdated and just reeked of old! At best 2  1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch, awesome food, awesome service, and a view of the lake. I had the fondito chimmie, it was wonderful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is alright, seems like they just threw it in the fryer and served it . Wouldn't go back ."}
{"text":"I am not a big Mexican food fan to begin with, so take this review with a grain of salt.  My fiance, her family and a few friends decided to eat here when we saw that it was featured restaurant on Restaurant.com.  Each couple printed out our coupons as we were all going to pay separately.  Everything was going great, the service was fast and courteous and the food was good, but when it came to paying for our check we were told that they would only honor one coupon since we were all sitting at the same table, even though we alerted our waiter to the fact that we were all paying separately and he said that would be fine.  After a few tense minutes with the manager, he reluctantly agreed to accept the coupons.  Aside from that the experience was okay.  The party I was with really likes Mexican food, so I'm sure they would rate it higher.  I had the shrimp fajitas I would rate as a 6 compared to the best shrimp fajitas I have ever had."}
{"text":"We've been here six or seven times and you never know what you're gonna get. The service will range from terrible to average (one exception) and there's always confusion at the front door. The food varies too... I've had great and I've had gross. This is the ONLY restaurant I've been to where I would be concerned to send food back. It just has a sketchy vibe.  The last time we went our server was Liz, and she was AWESOME! I don't know if we'll every have her again but she made my day. Same visit we both ordered seafood enchiladas, and for a $14 lunch portion you expect more than six 61/70 shrimp. Eh, we'll be back, 'cause my wife likes it. lol"}
{"text":"I love the Fundido and the chips and salsa are really good.  The Mexican pizza with jalapeno cream cheese is a great appetizer, they have an interesting variety of delicious margaritas, and the atmosphere in the cantina is subtly lively, if that makes any sense.  The staff is very friendly in the restaurant, but the service at the bar is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We come here a lot with our friends from church after our group meets. Good service, good food & the price is right. Outdoors is delightful when the weather permits!"}
{"text":"This place used to be fantastic, I remember going as a kid all the time and everytime I've gone recently it's been awful. Food=bad wait=bad service=bad we went at 530 and left the restaurant at 8 and got our food at 740 waitress took forever to take our order. Literally 30 min just to wait for her to take our order. Like ur kidding right. And the food took forever to come out and a) wasn't good b) forgot to put one of my family's items on order (props to the manager for taking that item off bill) but honestly shitty service I won't be returning. It seemed everyone's food was taking forever Bc no one had their food and we all had been waiting forever. Ironic Bc it wasn't even busy LOL food was terrible my brother and boyfriend got the same item and they came out looking completely different, quality was inconsistent. Location is all this place has got but don't waste ur time I'd rather eat Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Fine for a quick shredded beef taco.  I ordered it to go, and they had the wrong order when I arrived.  They did fix it pretty quickly.  Taco was really greasy, but that happens with shredded beef tacos.  I know what I'm getting in to.  Good amount of cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for HH.  Decent prices...decent food. The cantina was very crowded.  We enjoyed it.  Would definitely go back for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"They have three different locations and the first time I had their food it was catered for an event, and it was so good, that I had to go there. I went to one location out in Phoenix by one of my jobs, and ordered the shredded chicken tacos. AMAZING!!! They were soooo good, that I had to try their other location on Ray Road and it was just as amazing as the other two times I had it. I LOVE their tacos and their chips and salsa is to die for."}
{"text":"C, K and I stopped in for the happy hour specials. We grabbed a booth in the bar by the window. The bar was about half full and not very loud. Our server was Julie. Julie was amazing, she was easily one of the best servers we have had at Valle Luna. C ordered the classic cheese crisp ($4.50). Hot, bubbly, really good stuff. K and I split a 1/2 Taco basket all beef ($4.50) and the Chorizo Queso ($4.50). The taco's are pretty good. A good amount of beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and a slightly greasy shell. For a buck fifty each, no complaints. The Chorizo Queso was a bit disappointing. The queso was a bit runny and just didn't seem made correctly. I like the plain Queso much better and will return to it the next time we're here for happy hour. Awesome server, decent h.h. food, good h.h. prices. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"The taco basket on happy hour with the chips, salsa bean dip. Cheapest dinner ever. delicious."}
{"text":"This place used to be our favorite. But on Tuesday we went there and the service was awful. They got two parts of our order wrong and didn't offer any resolutions. The following day we were all sick. Suffice to say we won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This place has been a local for years,  and year after year they come up trumps,  great food,  great bartenders and some occasionally interesting people at the  bar."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area, from the perspective of someone who grew up in S. California. The steak tacos had a ton of flavor, even with just meat. The chips and salsa are excellent. I loved the frijoles a la olla. I will stop going to other Mexican places now!"}
{"text":"I went with my Birthday coupon for a free dinner but even without one this is the best real mexican in town.  I'm from San Diego and very picky when it comes to Mexican food. Valle Luna Rocks!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular. Love their green corn tamales and their taco basket is good. I go to the cantina to meet up with friends and enjoy happy hour. Always relaxed and can watch the game and talk with friends. Prompt service and good drinks. The \"lake\" nearby provides a good atmosphere. I love Mexican food but wouldn't say this is the greatest Mexican you'll ever have but pretty decent. I come from New Mexico, so I'm hard to please."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the buy one get one free entree's coupons for Luna?! we love the Fajita's and the Fundido. and it's even better when we get one meal for free!!! awesome place, great service. yummy chips and dips for free. it just gets better and better when we come. love it"}
{"text":"Valle Luna is an old favorite restaurant of mine. I have been coming here for years in part because it is near my work and home, but the food and atmosphere make it an easy choice when you are craving a good, authentic Mexican meal.   Whether you are here for Happy hour, lunch or dinner- there is something for everyone. Any restaurant that serves me a quality salsa with chips to begin my meal is solid in my book. Overall, it is a great looking restaurant with a lake side view if you dine in the back of the restaurant or on the patio, the food is decent and the prices are fair and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Good for what it is. Super greasy comfort Mexican food. Service is OK but could be quicker and more attentive. I would probably recommend other Mexican food places over this one most days but its nice on occasion."}
{"text":"When we walked in here it really felt like a chain Mexican restaurant like 3 Margaritas or On The Border.  They start off by giving you a big bowl of chips and everyone gets their own little bowls of salsa and refried bean dips. I really enjoyed the dips and think I ate every drop of it.  I got the shredded beef chimichanga and I don't remember it wowing me. It tasted fine, but nothing really stood out for me.  The service was another thing that was kinda \"meh\". It felt like we sat there for a really long time before anyone came by to take our drink order and they didn't come by a ton asking if we wanted refills on our margaritas (which were the one thing that was excellent)."}
{"text":"Valle Luna has fresh, hot food with great prices to match. I enjoy any combination plate for lunch or dinner, and those fajitas could fill an army! Our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive once she served us, but the team could work on cooperation. We sat in the bar for over 6 minutes without anyone speaking to us, though I made eye contact and smiled at 4 different employees before being greeted. We will visit this location again, and enjoy a nice evening out on the patio."}
{"text":"Was given this recommendation for some really good Mexican food. For starters, the salsa and chips were tasty. I ordered the Carne Asada with rice and beans with a side of Kilt Lifter . My partner ordered shredded beef tacos that looked delicious. The food wasn't bad in flavor at all. Wouldn't mind coming back to dine on the outdoor patio once summer is over."}
{"text":"Absolutely rude and horrible service. They are the worst experience I have ever had. The manager John is awful and unprofessional with a know it all attitude! First and last time I'll ever go there. I am a total foodie and quite frankly with all my travels all over the world this has been the worst experience I have ever had. They deserve like -0 star."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been thinking of Valle Luna for a week. A co worker brought a platter to my wife's work and she loved it. She brought her plate home for me and we both were very happy with the flavor.   Flash forward to tonight. Carlos was our knowledgeable server. We described the plate that we had eaten and he instructed us that we needed the green chile chimis. We got the Vallitas and Lunitas as an entree, crispy chicken flautas and bean/green chile/red chile chimis. I got the numero Uno. Chicken taco was juicy and crispy and crunchy and the flavor was just right. Green chile enchilada was piping hot but I could not stop eating. Rice and beans were done right.   The real winner of the night was desert. Carlos undersold and over delivered. The fried ice Cream was not the usual rock hard interior. This was the right size to fry the outside and just soften the inside. Not only do you get the best fried ice cream but cinnamon fried tortillas AND caramel cheesecake stuffed chimi.   We found our new favorite Mexican food. Well done Carlos and thank you Valle Luna."}
{"text":"First time at Valle Luna happy hour! Lake view amazing! Excellent choice!!! Drinks and food, awesome!! Thank you Esteban for the great service!"}
{"text":"The service here is awesome and the food along with it! I had the burrito bowl and my hubby had the enchiladas! Both very tasty. Be careful with chips and salsa. Muy delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and her girl friend went there for lunch a couple weeks ago and she thought it was great so she and I went there for lunch today.  What a terribly different experience from her first visit.  The chips were stale, the cheese crisp tortilla was horribly stale and old, and the salsa tasted like stewed tomatoes.  The service was nice and friendly and the beef enchiladas and taco were better than average.  Maybe it was timing, but you would think that Saturdays would be one of their busiest times and that they would be better prepared with fresher food."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu even with fajitas that came out sizzling. Had leftovers for the next day as well. Great place for larger groups and friendly service."}
{"text":"We went there a few months ago with a restaurant.com gift certificate. Pretty good service, refilled water without asking. We really stuffed ourselves with food too.  I think I got Fajitas, very good. Girlfriend doesn't remember what she got but she thought it was good as well."}
{"text":"Huge disappoint. I've been going to Valle Luna for years because our family loved the awesome complimentary bean dip, chips, and salsa with our meals. They are now charging $4.25 for a tiny order of their bean dip. The order wasn't enough for my three small kids much less anyone else."}
{"text":"Valle Luna serves my brother's favorite soup - the one with meat balls - every day of the week. The chips and salsa served with your meal are good."}
{"text":"Service was great but food took longer than usual. Carne asada was delicious lots of flavor. The restaurant has a great view of a lake.  I would definitely come here over and over again!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since we last visited Valle Luna.  It is about a 20-25 minutes drive from our house, so it is not exactly convenient.  I'd promised a Mexican Food Wednesday and I got so wrapped up in the day that I forgot to cook dinner (or even shop for it).  So, we headed to Valle Luna for Family Night.  When we arrived, we were told there would be a 15 minute wait.  About 22 minutes later, we were seated in Gloria's section.  After being seated, we didn't see our waitress for about 5 minutes.  She came up to the table sort of frantic and asked if she could take our drink order.  I asked if we could put in our daughter's food order, since it was getting late and she was hungry.  She told me that she couldn't take the order because she had to go drop off two checks.  Huh?  So she took our drink order and came back with the drinks.  Then she said she would be right back.  Ten more minutes passed and she asked to take our daughter's order.  We told her we were ready to place our entire order, but to please bring our daughter's food out as soon as possible.  I also asked for hot salsa.   After that, we did not get visited by Gloria again.  She made eye contact with me twice - once when she was headed in from the patio and once when she was picking up silverware from a makeshift host table next to our table, but she did not come to our table and just zoomed off.  We heard her say aloud \"oh, hot salsa\" but she never returned.  No drink refills, nothing.  We waited for more than 30 minutes before asking the hostess to find her.  The hostess was under the impression we were just waiting for our check.  We said, no, we had not even been served our food.  We asked for a manager.  Then, Gloria comes to our table, picks up our drinks and asks if we want a refill.  \"No thank you.  We would like to leave.  We have been waiting for too long without service.\"  She said she would get a manager.  We waited another ten minutes and then I took my daughter to the car, letting the hostess know we were leaving and that her dad was staying to talk to the manager.    He talked to the manager and the manager offered to check on our food and comp the food, but it was already far too late and we were in the car.  He said the manager seemed genuine and polite.  We won't be back to Valle Luna again.  I don't know why the waitress was serving both our table and the patio, but that has to be part of the problem.  There is no real team service there, which could have resolved our drink refill issue.    The bottom line is that Valle Luna is just OKAY food to begin with.  They really need to have stellar service if they want to keep customers... and they just don't have it."}
{"text":"Yeah, methinks not. It's not like the place is a disaster, so I feel bad giving it one star, but...it was pretty bad. I ordered the chile relleno and an enchilada. The chile relleno cheese wasn't even melted -- gross. And the chile, I couldn't even cut through it with a fork. The egg batter was smooshy. Yuck. Worst relleno I've ever had, including the microwaved crap you get at the 'bertos chains. (If you like chile rellenos like I do, go over to El Zocalo -- awesome relleno). The enchilada was good; however, the enchilada sauce was super salty, I mean like they salted it way too much, then salted it just a bit more.  We also had the albondigas soup with salad. The meatballs were undercooked, red inside. The salad was right out of a bag.  Even the iced tea sucked.  The place has such a nice ambiance and a great view, right there on the water. I hope our experience wasn't the norm."}
{"text":"Smoking, smoke in my face.  I use to enjoy the patio but the cigarette smoking is out of control....cant sit there and be sick from the smell and eat too. Yuk"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch with my grandmother!! It was a beautiful day and the service was above average. Christian took such good care of us and our needs were always met. I really appreciated him saving us money by making our lunch order into a dinner meal.  We will continue going there not only for the atmosphere but for the staff."}
