{"text":"I work across the street from this restaurant, but never went in because I usually pick up lunch and bring it back to my office to eat it.  I saw that there was a Living Social voucher so I thought \"why not?\". The food may turn out to be really good and I would be open to going back for more if I like it. There were two options: A) Dine-in or take out for $14, B) Dine-in only because there is alcohol included.  After purchasing it, I called to make my lunch order and to confirmed it would be take-out. As soon as the man heard I was using a deal voucher his mood went sour. He said it was dine-in only and take-out was absolutely not allowed. I reiterated that the fine print on the voucher says take-out allowed, but he refused to acknowledge it. I told him he might want to check with Living Social because everyone is buying it based on that allowance. He said, \"The whole point in doing this deal is to get people into the restaurant\" (which is understandable). But before I could finish explaining to him that maybe there was a mistake, he said with frustration, \"If you have a problem, go talk to Living Social. I'm really busy. I have to go. (and hung up).\"  Unfortunately, the man who works the phone/counter does not realize that brushing people off on the phone is just as bad as providing horrible service in person. People who work in the King/Sherbourne tend to be stick to the same lunch spots because of the limited options. They find a place they like, and they become loyal costumers. The phone conversation I had was enough to keep me far away from Bistro 243. I've asked for a refund on my voucher, not because I cannot dine-in, but because I refuse to support this place in any shape or form."}
{"text":"There was plenty wrong with this place when I visited a few weeks back.  The interior, and the washrooms, were a bit run down and grotty looking - definitely in need of a good freshening up.  Our server had an attitude that annoyed me; trying to be funny and smart but ultimately coming across as arrogant and just downright annoying.   I ordered over-easy eggs (at the request of the server, which I thought was bizarre ?!), and they came medium/hard.   Despite being sensitive to caffeine, I needed two americanos here just to get me awake - not the greatest coffee in either taste or strength. And they weren't really americanos, either - just automated machine coffee a la your office coffee machine.  All that said, and despite my eggs not coming to my preference, I enjoyed my brunch here. The eggs, home fries and toast combo was tasty, fresh, cheap and in a generously sized portion. Service was fast even though I wasn't crazy on the guy's attitude. There's a good variety of stuff on the menu and the prices are great, especially considering there's no similar options or competition in the area.   Despite the flaws, I would have no problem returning here. As Canadians are so fond of saying... ''it is what it is''... :-)"}
{"text":"Service is really good.  Food is ok.  Curry chicken is nice.   Price is average. Take out price is cheaper  What I like about this restaurant ?  the restaurant is quiet,, they don't play any type of hard rock music in there. Servers are super friendly  The only mistake the owner made is, they did not change the name. Apparently, all the previous reviews don't apply to the existing owner anymore.  I would give 3.5 if they can change their items on the menu from time to time."}
{"text":"Waited a bit longer than expected.  fish and fries was good, loads of fish perfectly fried.  Salmon was good too.  Has brunch now but not sure how long this resto will last."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place has some good good food. Chorizo scramble what? Delicious. That's what. Lots of it too. And I liked being congratulated on finishing. It made me feel like a big boy. My girlfriend's eggs Florentine looked super good too with it's salad and potatoes so I ate that too. Yum. Oh and it was cheap too. Awesome."}
{"text":"I thought this was a great place! Came here after the wait at Petit Dejeuner looked just way too long. We were seated immediately, coffee poured and orders taken.  So efficient! I had the big breakfast, which for a MERE $10, included 2 sausages, 2 bacon, homefries, 3 eggs and pancakes!  The menu said you would get 2 pancakes, alas, only 1 showed up.  Which was fine, cause really, that was way too much food for me.  That being said, I ate it all!  Bonus points for serving REAL maple syrup, not that junky corn-syrup maple flavoured crap you get at most places.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst breakfast experience I have had in Toronto.  Let me preface this with the fact that the SPACE is adorable with a lovely open garage window.  The server was also verty lovely but a lot confusing.   The niceness of the place stops here.  -Came here for brunch.  Had a nice looking menu.  The portions looked quite substantial. -We ordered coffee.  it was TERRIBLE.  I told the server that it tasted burnt and it wasn't very good.  I asked for an espresso.  They don't have an espresso machine.  The serer then told me there were no other coffee alternatives.  I said that was fine.  and then she proceeded to ask me if I wanted MORE coffee and THEN CHARGED it to our bill even though I told them the coffee was terrible and placed it on the side of the table to be taken away.  -The breakfast LOOKED amazing.  The actual food was VERY substandard.  I asked for eggs poached soft.  They were poached hard.  The potatoes were dusted with something that looked delicious but it tasted like boiled potato and nothing else.  -The rest of the breakfast was uninspiring and HONESTLY worse than one of those 3.99$ breakfast diners  -The entire place was rather terrible given that it looks like a cute space and the server was nice....enough... even though there was some clear issues with what to do when a customer tells you the coffee is terrible and still charges it to your bill.  My brunch mates all agreed we would nevr come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem- really give it a try. I come here regularly and haven't had a less than stellar experience yet. The food is delicious. The service is so good, I've never met nicer management and servers. Bill has been running the place since April and he makes it feel so cozy, it's like a home away from home, with beer and burgers. I find there's a lot of business at Betty's nearby, but when you want a quieter night, bistro 243 is just down the street and is perfect."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch! $10 for eggs, multigrain toast, potatoes, bacon, peameal bacon, and 2 terrific fluffy pancakes and service was fast and friendly. The rest of the brunch menu looks great, also. It's now our go-to place for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"What a nice little place, and no wait at the door for Sunday Brunch.  My friend and I had a hard time to decide as there were many desirable menu items; Pancakes, Eggs, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Omelettes, Monte Cristo, French Toast & Eggs Benny were some of the choices.   I had the Eggs Benny with Salmon and my friend had the Hamburger with Fries. We both had a pint of Keith Pale Ale and the tab came to $36. Nice place. Loved the open kitchen and the music was lively and upbeat."}
{"text":"Stopped here on Sunday for brunch with a fellow yelper.    I ordered a burger and my friend Cynthia G. ordered the eggs benny with salmon. Admittedly, there were quite a few things on their menu that looked good, so deciding on the burger was probably a bit of a cop-out, but I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous that day.    Our server was friendly, the overall decor and feel of the restaurant was ok, not spectacular, just ok.  We did both quite enjoy the music they were playing, some Steve Miller Band, Janice Joplin...the music certainly did improve the vibe of this small place.  Our food arrived in a decent amount of time and though my salad was a bit overdressed, but the dressing was nice and citrusy, if not a little too sweet.  My burger, for the most part was quite flavourful, with the exception of a large burnt section of the patty, same with the thin crusted bun they served it on.  There is no way that the chef could not have noticed that he had burned both the burger and the bun, and yet sent it out anyway.    No worries, at least my draft beer was good!   This place gets 2 stars for the music, our draught beer and our server...everything else was a bit of mess in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ended up here strictly by chance, walking by  after attending an evening seminar. They had a Mushroom burger special on the board outside with a greek salad.  I went in and ordered that, with a glass of beer (3 on tap including Mill st organic).  The place was not busy, around  10pm, and the waiter was friendly then a few more folks wandered in to watch the hockey game.  The decor is nothing to write home about, and its not a very big place. However, I give them top marks for $$$ value.  It's also a cozy place, 2 girls were chatting it up big time close to me and were obvious regulars  The burger was served on a thinner multigrain type bun, and was quite tasty; the salad was excellent.  Considering its a little further East of Yonge st, on King, you can bypass the fancier places there if you want something tasty and on the simple side  Give this joint a try!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and I was surprised. Great brunch, try the skillet. Great service and the omelets are a must. The place is nothing fancy, but you'll be well taken care of. Good value and it's a good brunch experience."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Caesar Salad and it was really good! The portion was really big too and it cost about $12. Pretty empty when I got there, but the waiter was super friendly."}
{"text":"\"The word \"Bistro\" is not really used correctly here, this place is mediocre at best\"  I'll pre-face this by saying I bought a Groupon to go here. Groupon tends to give me an opportunity to try a new restaurant without committing to the full cost of what the menu is asking for, so I think its good value.  I bought this groupon back in January 2015 and had made a reservation for February 14th (valentine's day) and they called me the morning of February 14th cancelling my reservation the morning of a very busy day for restaurant reservations leaving me without a plan for that day. I understand they had to cancel due to flooding in their restaurant however it was very inconvenient.  Fast forward to actually visiting the restaurant in April. The place is called Bistro 243. The word Bistro is defined as a small restaurant serving moderately priced food (affordable) in a small setting. In terms of the literal definition, yes, this is a small place and yes the food is affordable.   However the restaurant itself seemed very \"empty\" and not much in the way of atmosphere. Sparse looking bar and poor table layout not really offering the type of atmosphere other bistros in the city offer. Again I was here for a groupon so I won't be too critical. When it came to using the groupon they had a note on the front door specifically for groupon users that a reservation was a required which is not uncommon, however the host announces it a loud that you're here for a \"groupon\" when arriving and it makes you feel cheap and a lesser than the average customer, especially in that they don't provide you a paper menu and only let you know what you're entitled to.  Appetizer: salad was nothing special. literally mixed greens, tomatoes and dressing  Second Appetizer was mushrooms in a vinegrette sauce and pita bread  Main course: new york strip, fries, and small veg.  Dessert: apple pie, fruit with ice cream, and a chocolate cake.  Not terrible, but certainly not amazing or memorable. The atmosphere is very dull and the majority of the tables are set-up like you're in a fallafel take out place. I wasn't a fan. I think there are better meals around town for what this groupon cost."}
{"text":"Bistro 243 is permanently CLOSED.  There is now a restaurant called \"il fresco\" on the same spot."}
{"text":"Chorizo scramble was delicious and served on a sizzling cast iron pan, so it remained hot throughout breakfast, which was lovely.  The chorizo was flavorful but the dish advertised \"shredded potatoes\", they weren't shredded but more of a home fry style.    Servers were attentive.  Portions are HUGE.  For 10$ could have served two people easily.    All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Fabulous service! They were welcoming, and despite a thriving breakfast service seemed genuinely excited to have us- like showing up at a best friend's for brunch. The food was amazing. I have food allergies and they were knowledgeable and accommodating... If we lived in Toronto we would be regulars. You won't be disappointed here... Plus my fiancé got to watch hockey and the tv didn't take away from the cute bistro feel..."}
{"text":"Pretty decent brunch on the weekend. Get the bistro big breakfast, it is the best value."}
{"text":"I went today for brunch because I didn't have the patience to wait in line down the street for the place with the big lines. This was my first time here and I'll be back. The French toast, eggs Benedict, and service were great. By the time I left, they had a full house. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Boo!  After a long walk on the beach with my dog, Eli, and buying a new couch at EQ3, I was really ready to get my eat on!!!  Disillusioned by the long line up at Petit Dejeuner and motivated to get the hell out of the November drizzle, I compromised on brunch and decided to take a chance at Bistro 243.  The emptiness of the place should have been my first sign - it did not bode well.    I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich with half fries, half salad.  I appreciated the fact that they accommodated my request.  My partner ordered the burger, and our friend, who is visiting from Montreal, ordered the french toast with a side of sausage.  My sandwich was pretty lame... talk about going easy on the fillings, but at least the bread was good.  My salad had virtually no dressing.  Our friend, who is Québécois and quite an expert on maple syrup as it turns out, was very unimpressed because their syrup was completely artificial.  And the sausages looked like some cheap ass Maple Leaf microwavable crap.  The burger was burned and the bun was so thin the toppings ran right threw it.  The cheese which cost around $2 extra was a slab of no-name like cheddar thrown on top, not even remotely melted.  Not once did the server come over to refill our coffee until we were asking for the bill when she finally remembered she hadn't done so.  All in all, I am very embarrassed to have taken our friend there especially considering when we were in Montreal, she took us to Les Cons Servent.  Il n'y a aucune comparaison!"}
{"text":"They just reopened from a major flood in February when I went in March 2015. New walls,  wood flooring, etc. Much brighter than I remembered on my one visit a few years back.   Staff were amazing. We were happy with our meals and found the prices to be very reasonable."}
{"text":"My experience at this King Street bistro was akin to unleashing a greased otter on a ski slope, i.e., going downhill and fast. I grabbed a seat at the bar on Saturday morning, hoping for a quick breakfast. What I got was a schmozzle.  Not feeling like coffee, I opted for a freshly squeezed OJ. Not only was the juice not freshly squeezed, it wasn't even stirred properly. When I asked about it, my server confessed that it was freshly squeezed, but also from a carton. I don't think she was trying to mislead me, but clearly we diverged on the definition of fresh. She was kind enough to take the drink back.  They were also having problems with their menu, which was barely a week old on my visit. My trio of eggs and toast arrived without the promised homefries. When I asked about this, the server consulted the kitchen. Reporting that they \"couldn't reach consensus\" about whether my dish came with homefries was baffling. We don't need quorum -- it's literally written on the menu. Again, they gave me the homefries without a fuss, but it was a hollow victory because they tasted like sand. No taste at all.  All this is a shame, because the space is truly beautiful, the food is cheap, and the service, while perhaps confused, is well-intentioned and friendly. As is often  heard on Yelp, \"I really wanted to like this place,\" but ultimately, I don't.  Obligatory Title Pun: Just for fun let's rate this BISTRO: TWO point FOUR THREE.  Menu Readability: Like everything else in this space, it looks great.  Need to mention: They have a full bar behind the counter. Maybe slinging drinks is where they shine?  What this place teaches me about myself: When I say freshly squeezed, I don't mean 'ever.' I mean like, today."}
{"text":"Great service, location, and ambiance, but too many shortcuts taken in the food.  I had an expired groupon that the server took at face value with no problem. This was a very pleasant switch from the usual attitude you get when you carry a voucher. He was very attentive and polite, always refilling coffee.  He was great.  The next table had the annoyingly smug and libidinous waiter that other reviewers have mentioned. I see what they meant - and avoid him.  I ordered the Big Breakfast ($11.50), a coffee ($2.50), a freshly squeezed OJ ($2.50).  The portions are very generous. The breakfast had 3 perfectly over hard eggs, the best crispy bacon (I like it so crispy that it shatters if you tap it against the plate), 3 sausage links, home fries, 2 pancakes, a fruit garnish, and toast. The sausage is store-bought. The home fries were made from frozen (the kind you get at a cafeteria), although jazzed up a little with cayenne. The pancakes were from a mix and had oil in them, not butter (they had that unpleasant fried taste).  The coffee was a bit burned. The OJ was freshly poured at best.  Not sure why they call themselves a bistro. There wasn't much bistro quality to it, even though they had pictures of Paris on the wall.  It's a diner that serves booze.  I would go back if I lived close by, but I don't, and I won't travel to it."}
{"text":"Bistro 243 is a distinctly 3-star restaurant.   There's nothing wrong with Bistro 243, but there's also nothing spectacular going on. I had the Monte Cristo (w/salad) which was acceptably tasty. The service, decor, and price ($30 for two. Coffee & tip included) were again, nothing fantastic and nothing horrible. No real complaints. I just wasn't wowed.  It seems Bistro 243 exists as the Salieri to (fellow King Street breakfast joint) Petite Dejeuner's Mozart. For those who aren't willing to endure the perpetual line outside Petitle Dejeuner, the mediocre Bistro 243 is only a few steps away.   Low expectations will ensure an enjoyable dinning experience."}
{"text":"Our server Bill was friendly and welcoming.  He ran the place like he owned it which really showed that he cared.  The food was good and served exactly as described and as expected.  The drinks were made exactly as ordered."}
