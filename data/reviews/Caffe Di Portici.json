{"text":"I loved their beets sauced pasta it was something I had never tried before but turned out more amazing than what I ever envisioned it to taste. Slightly tangy but still holds its saucey substance. Love the cozy environment as well. Love love love"}
{"text":"I love a cafe that can pamper you from dawn to midnight! The authentic Italian atmosphere of this lovely little place will keep me coming back, even though it's a few neighbourhoods distant from my usual haunts. Terrific Napoli-style pizza, a lovely patio, and a pretty extensive menu considering how teeny the kitchen must be."}
{"text":"This is  a favourite hangout of ours.  The service is friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable.  My favourite is the pepperoni pizza with two eggs sunny-side up, but I agree the paninis are also fantastic."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. It's like a little taste of Rome in my mouth. Would come again.
The seating is nice, the service is nice, the pricing is good."}
{"text":"Food is great and a nice addition to the block. I wish the owner would figure out his staff so your food wouldn't take a life time to get to your table. The place has amazing potential!"}
{"text":"Fresh and interesting ingredients, a good brunch. Dog friendly patio. Sip a mimosa with your pup and people watch - not a bad way to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh
I just had the best Pizza in Toronto and I thought I was in Italy! Adorable patio at yonge and Scollard. All the dishes were delicious, even the bread was crisp and freshly made, my new favorite place to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to stop by this place as I pass it almost everyday, and finally got the chance to for lunch.

The pizza was delicious. Tried the calabrese and arrabiata pizzas and both were amazing! The crust was super thin and all of the ingredients were so fresh! 

Nice change from all of the other restaurants in the area! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. The toppings were well seasoned and the tomato sauce was nice. The cheese is decent but the tasty crust makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place is really European, and I love it.
It has a nice patio, and sadly, Toronto does not have the prettiest views. You get a view of a boring street or a gas station, take your pick.
Nevertheless, decor inside and outside is clean and stylish, and they give you lemon-infused water, where the scent of the lemon is there, but there is no lemon piece in your glass that attack your lips whenever you take a sip of water. 
The food is so very good. You can tell that they do not use cheap ingredients.  Ingredients are fresh, and they let the ingredients shine as they should. Even their pastry is homemade, and you will not be disappointed with anything on the menu. 
Service was more than great; waiter was courteous, attentive, without being overbearing.
Definitely a keeper as a place for relaxing lunch or brunch. The price is very good for the quality, especially in this high-end area."}
{"text":"After a long day of expensive shopping on Bloor Street we decided to eat here because the Yelp reviews told us it was inexpensive, delicious and low-key. And we have to agree: yes, yes, and yes. The restaurant is set back from the Scollard/Younge intersection and is definitely not easy to spot unless you are looking for it. The atmosphere is more like a coffee bar or cafe than a restaurant. It is very casual, although it does have table-service, a substantial menu and a reasonable selection of wines and bottled beers. We both had pizza (thin-crust, wood-fired-oven-style) and it was really excellent. Their paninis also looked tasty. The staff was suuuuuuuper friendly. This isn't the type of place I'd bring someone for a night out, but if I lived in the neighborhood I'd be a regular for every other night of the week!
Also: they do take-out... and they have a large amount of outdoor seating for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Just came from brunch and it was a pretty good meal. The restaurant itself is a little quaint place that does not have a lot of seating. They had a nice patio but it was a little too chilly for that. 
My husband ordered the salmon and I had the brunch pizza. Salmon was good and generous. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it. My brunch pizza was good if not a little too much. I think the pizza could've fed us both without having to order another entree. My only complaint was that the egg was a little too cooked and they added too much pepper on top of it. 
All in all, it's a place we would definitely come back to. Maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"Calabrese pizza was delicious; crispy thin crust, fresh toppings, piping hot. Went well with a glass of Merlot. Cappuccino with a hazelnut shot was a perfect way to end my lunch. Great value!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas, $10 specials on Wednesday. Both were amazing: Canadese & Capriccioso. Also the homemade chili sauce is spectacular. Friendly service & unpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to live in TO and come back 2-3 x a year and love to experience new areas. Stayed this time in Yonge/Bloor area and read Yelp reviews about this place. Most saying food was excellent and service sometimes not so. Well my experience was that both were excellent. Pizza was the best I have had in TO. Had the Calabrese which was excellent, appropriately spiced, crust excellent! So next day had to try the panini. Same experience, excellent! Had the fontina again nicely spiced (yes, I like spicy foods!). If you're looking for a place with great pizza or panini then you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Caffe di Portici is a perfect little oasis at the edge of Yorkville. But rather than Yorkville's typical style over substance, this cafe has genuine heart. 

I stumbled upon this place over the summer after seeing the Lavazza signs over the wraparound patio. Excellent Italian coffee bar, best in the neighbourhood in my opinion, but most surprising was the food. I came in for an espresso but after seeing what other tables were eating, I couldn't help myself. I had a special and very satisfying pizza, and I'm not easy to please when it comes to pizza.  So far I've sampled the pizza, pasta and panini, and everything has been above my expectations. The whole menu is reasonably priced.

Service is top notch, and the owners go out of their way to make your experience pleasant. They mentioned their liquor license is coming in this week. This is my new favourite place."}
{"text":"No need for a long review... I went to Caffe Di Portici with a colleague for dinner, after having read reviews. We wanted pizza, and not just one of the usual chains, and the restaurant was close to where we were staying in town.

We both ordered the special, bottle of beer and a pizza off their standard pizza menu for $15. We both got the chicken (Pollo) pizza. 

The food came out after about 10 minutes and it was cooked perfectly. This pizza is exactly what I was hoping for. A proper Italian pizza, minimalist in nature with ingredients, but exactly what the doctor ordered. I really enjoyed it, and my co-worker did as well.

The experience overall was a good one, only small gripe was that it took a while to order our food and for our beers to come out.

I plan to go back in the future."}
{"text":"Lunch on the patio - although reserved and seated, waiter asked us to move to the outside area as he had a large group coming in. Sure enough table was much smaller and it started to rain before we left so we had to cut our lunch meet a little short.
We all shared bruschetta app, then had pizza.
Not bad, but not memorable either. Crust not very fresh, which makes it hard to cut. No parmesan offered had to ask. Little things like that lent us to believe we were more of an annoyance than appreciated.
Likely won't return."}
{"text":"Was passing through the area and wanted to stop for a quick coffee. Ordered a coffee and biscotti - at the counter and was told there was table service. I ordered at the counter due to wanting to be in and out reasonably quickly.

The server dropped off what I ordered and then came back telling me to put my water bottle away as it wasn't from there. It was a warm day, I took it off the table.

No problems with doing that, but she never offered me table water instead and was sort of rude in her approach to asking me.

Coffee was average, between the water situation and the $9 something price - I won't be back nor be recommending it."}
{"text":"A cozy little cafe with an inviting outdoor patio in good weather, friendly informal service and consistently delicious food. Excellent pizzas, pastas and the absolute best Caprese salad I've ever had. Unpretentious and consistently good."}
{"text":"Great pizza, decent service but the sparkling water was a bit overpriced - would have asked for tap water if I'd known it was going to cost $10. Cute decor and nice patio."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while walking around Toronto. It was delicious! The service was incredible - the staff are so friendly and attentive. Be sure to try the bruschetta."}
{"text":"A new italian place! It's in a slightly hidden location, but I really think it's a gem that fellow Yelpers should try. It's fairly small and relatively new, but don't let that deter you!

The food is extremely fresh, simple, and delicious. 

They don't have a pasta section on their regular menu because they have daily fresh pasta specials instead. Also, this place is extremely friendly for a student budget! Nothing costs more than around $12 (without tax/tip). 

Seriously folks. I had to throw this up onto Yelp because I noticed that no one has listed it yet! I hope all of you who try it have as good an experience as I did. :)

I have been unable to post up pictures as of yet. So check out my food blog, located conveniently in my profile, to get the full scoop! Cheers!"}
{"text":"In Toronto, it is often difficult to find a baby-friendly, stroller-friendly restaurant. Maybe it's their Italian roots but my friend and I were both welcomed at Caffe Di Portici with our babes AND strollers for a girls' lunch. The young, all-male staff could not have been more accommodating!! We stayed for hours and were able to relax and drink wine and recharge our mummy batteries. I would highly recommend this spot especially as the weather gets better because they have a great covered patio. The food was perfect and the complimentary dessert was literally the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Feels modern and very Italian. Calebrese pizza was excellent, delicious thin crust was crispy and chewy. The Italian cream torte was perfect too. Best for be was the Aperol Spritz aperitif, delicously bitter. Worth a walk to for a late evening relaxed and delicious snack or dinner."}
{"text":"The pasta is excellent!  I've been enjoying popping by after work for a glass of wine on their patio.  I also like the fact that my dog is welcome to sit with me outside.  

I took 1 star away because I had a dessert, I believe it was a gluten free slice of cake.  It was quite expensive and not very tasty.  However, the other desserts looked tempting."}
{"text":"This is my first favorite place in town. Caffe Di Portici offers simple, unexpensive, fresh, great italian food (not pasta though) in a very nice atmosphere. The place is hidden among Yorkville's streets in a silent corner offering a relaxing environment and a whole view of the street, specially if you sit outside. The service is friendly, the music is very nice, you can sit for hours having a beer, talking to a friend, or just relaxing. The place has a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel in your childhood's neighborhood. We went at 7pm on a Sunday and ordered bruschetas, a pizza capricciosa, a beer, an orange juice and a espresso. Everything was very good, and prices were very fair. Definitively will go back to this place often."}
{"text":"This place is a decent find in this area. I came here for a last min brunch on a weekend as most of the other bookmarked spots nearby had a wait. 
Place is a simple and too the point. I ordered the smoked salmon with a bagel and it came with a side of a bean salad and fresh fruit on the side. 
The cappuccino I ordered was forgettable. Poorly frothed milk and a bitter shot. No latte art. I don't enjoy lavazza beans much so too each their own here.
The smoked salmon was decent and I enjoyed the salad as it was decent. Service is OK. Once one factors in the price component for this area it is a bit of bargain and a good value for this area.
3 Stars and I might come back to try a pizza."}
{"text":"Avoid the biscotti. Stale and way over-priced at $3.95 each. 

Went in for a mid morning snack. Didn't have any other food options besides a random chocolate cake. 

Maybe the high reviews are for dinner."}
{"text":"Great value for fantastic, fresh food.  Service was a bit slow, but you know it's because they have one cook making everything fresh and to order.  

Had the special lunch pizza with blue cheese, pears, prosciutto, arugula and balsamic reduction; it was DIVINE.  Super thin crust, and the flavours shone through.  Friend had a red pizza with mozzarella and prosciutto and man, that sauce was amazing.  you could just taste the freshness.  

Without a doubt this is the best pizza in the city; they could definitely teach Terroni a thing or two.  Best pizza I've had outside of Italy itself.  And c'mon, they serve Lavazza coffee; legit stuff.

Service was super friendly and unpretentious; a gem in Yorkville!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get a more casual lunch in Yorkville area so I decided to try the $10 pizza deal on a Wednesday. Caffe Di Portici has a quaint patio area with lots of seating and there were lots of people just reading books with a cup of coffee. It's nice seeing such a laid back atmosphere in central downtown, really!

The service was wonderful, as well as the food. The people working here were really accommodating for my vegetarian relatives and even offered baking the pizza with half meat, half without. The vegetarian platter was light, delicious and I enjoyed the little side of olives that come with it. Thought it was a nice touch! For pizzas, we got the carpicciosa and the summer pizza. The pizzas here are simple and done right. Also nothing fancy, but authentic. I felt as though I was passing time in an European cafe. I didn't get the coffee myself but my party all agreed that it was good coffee for such a reasonable price.

We didn't feel rushed at all and it was such a perfect way to spend a casual afternoon in Yorkville :)"}
{"text":"So tell me, what happened to this once delightful café? The terrace, the food, the service  provided for a lovely experience...until it didn't. Yes, the terrace is still a nice, albeit noisy, oasis. The quality of the food, however, has deteriorated despite being told the cook hasn't changed. Maybe a little vacation could do her/him some good? 
The servers are very friendly and pleasant and if you don't mind a pizza with a missing ingredient or a salad minus the dressing or slurping some coffee off your saucer then you will happily get along. And if that, in itself, is difficult to achieve, you can at least be grateful you were able to avoid the owner, probably the surliest, rudest man in Yorkville. 
Perhaps limiting visits to once a month, if only for the coffee, might keep the appreciation of Portico alive."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday for lunch to try out their pizza, after hearing about their $10 pizza special on Wednesday. 

Order their \"Summer Pizza\" that had prosciutto, figs, arugula, balsamic vinegar and parmesan. As a lover of  pizza, I was impressed. 

The pizza had great flavour, wasn't too heavy, and sitting in their patio made it better. 

Wednesday lunches have now become a weekly routine here, and I suggest everyone come try their pizza out.

Side note: if you like some kick to your pizza, ask for the chili oil"}
{"text":"Although the service was very friendly, I felt like my pizza was not much better than something I could buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. I bought the \"Canadese\" but it honestly just looked and tasted like a cheap pepperoni and cheese pizza. The menu is very long - maybe if they condense it a bit, they could focus more on a few high quality items."}
{"text":"This restaurant is why I love Yelp. I was craving pizza and wanted something close to Varsity Cinemas and found this spot.

We almost didn't go in because it looked like a takeout coffee place, just bright and not at all what you would expect a pizzeria to be. But I persisted and we went in. Music was loud and there was a TV showing CP24. But once the food and drink came, we felt like we were back in Italy. The wine was one of the best glasses of red I've had in months. It was the primitivo, if you're wondering. I'm actually going to have to research which one it was and stock up. The pizza was incredible. The crust was super thin and perfect. The sauce was fantastic and the ingredients were salty and savoury (I had the Siciliana, which had olives, anchovies, capers, no cheese). The food and drink more than made up for anything else that gave me reservations about the place. 

The Hubster had the Canadese and loved it. He said it was the closest thing he's had to the pizzas we had Naples in Canada. To top it off, the prices are great! 

We are DEFINITELY going back. Dinner here and a movie might just become our new usual thing."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere- it's modern but at the same time, a bit old school European. They take their time with service, which is a nice change from most brunch restaurants in the area. It gives clients a chance to relax and enjoy the food rather than feel rushed. Not everyone wants to get out of the restaurant quickly. For brunch, I highly recommend the quattro formaggi frittata- deliciously cheesy!! One thing I'd suggest to the restaurant is to have a but more variety with their fruit - beyond apples and pineapples. The mini mason jars are cute, though."}
{"text":"So delicious and so well priced. I've been coming here for years and am personally a big fan of the brunch pizza with two sunny-side eggs on it, but you can't go wrong with much here. Panini's are killer."}
{"text":"As much as I want to keep this place all to myself, I'm sure others will eventually find this neighbourhood gem as a great place for a causal quick meal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5 - it's casual, yet upscale.  It's inviting and cozy at the same time.  This place has more of a laid back Italian cafe atmosphere.  Even though it's in Yorkville, it's not pretentious at all.  

Service: 3.5/5  The waitress was very friendly, brought out my menu and coffee quickly.  The only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is because each order takes at least 15 minutes, but considering everything is i made from scratch, it's a reasonable wait. 

Food/price - I had a coffee - $2 approx and a calabrese pizza which had olives, spicy salami, peppers, artichoke (I think) on a thin crust with virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and chili oil on the side, which was $10.95.  It was a thin crust pizza and made-to-order.  The crust and the base were delicious and piping hot.  Even the salami tasted amazing.  I'm not the biggest fan of pizza as a lot of pizza chains use frozen ingredients, but it seemed fresher here.  Also, their coffee is Lavatzza, which I fell in love with while in California last week.  

Verdict: A great unpretentious Italian place in the Yorkville area at reasonable prices, good service and amazing food.  Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"I came here for beakfast and the food was great! I recommend the \"Portici Delight\" which is, two eggs sunny-side-up, bacon or italian sasuage, breakfast potatoes and toasted baguette served with fruit salad."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Traveling alone to a new place is always a crapshoot, but this perfectly fit my need to get good food in a non-stuffy, single-friendly atmosphere at a good price (unfortunately I don't have one of those sky's the limit expense accounts).  The fact that I felt like I was sitting on a street corner in Milan (except that everybody was speaking English) or that it's apparently a gathering place for people with dogs, so I could watch all the pooches mingle with each other and the various kids who were there, just made it all the better.  It was a beautiful evening, I sat outside, had a half liter of wine and a very good pizza, and just enjoyed the heck out of myself.  Win!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto from Southern California, a group of us went into this small unassuming café for a quick pizza and beer and were surprised to find both the food and service rivaled that of a five star Italian restaurant, though not at a five star price. 

Eight of us visited, so I had a chance to sample a lot of different items.  For starters we had bruschetta and a couple of salads and the ingredients tasted like they were just picked from the garden.    We ordered a few different pizzas and all were cooked to perfection with a nice thin crispy crust.  I dare say that this has to be the best pizza in Toronto and it is better than any pizza I've had in Southern California.  My favorite had to be the prosciutto arugula pizza with fresh shaved parimagiano-reggiano.  The pastas were also excellent with very fresh tomato and meat sauces. 

If you are a water fan, this place even has a water selection that reads like a wine list.  They must have had 20 different brands of imported waters to choose from that some in our group selected, though I personally stuck with beer--also a nice selection of imports to choose from.

The dessert was also fantastic-- we had some imported Italian cookies and I got to sample the cheesecakes which were awesome.  When I asked where they came from, the waitress whispered to me they were ordered through the Cheesecake Factory- a favorite of mine in California.  I don't think they have Cheesecake Factory locations in Canada, so if you've heard of this popular US chain and wanted to try it, this is the place.   My favorite was the strawberries and cream flavored cheesecake.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but those that ordered the various coffee-based drinks were very impressed.

As for atmosphere, the staff was all extremely friendly and attentive. We sat outside, so I got to watch the Blue Jay game on the flat screen TV while listening to music that they have piped in online from Italy.  We loved it so much that we went back a second time during our trip and had an equally great experience.  This place was so good and the staff so friendly, I promised them that I would join Yelp and write my first review to help spread the word about this place."}
{"text":"Portici sounds a lot fancier than it looks. Walking in it feels very minimalist (although it's not) because of the wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows, and their very clean color palette of black and white. It was indeed a slow day because of the snow but I am glad we went.
We had the Lasange alla Bolognese and Cacciatore Pizza (i think?) for lunch and a ice coffee, ice cappucino and their chocolate cake for dessert. 
When  you order, they bring you a bottle of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and a little bowl of olive oil infused with tiny chopped peppers (I think similar to Thai peppers). And so we waited for the bread which never came. Disappointment #1 but quickly made up by the fact that my dish came with bread :)
The Pizza first of all was sublime! The dough was light and crisp and it wasn't sauced too heavily and the layer of cacciatore gave the pizza a nice kick that fulfilled my need for spice. The lasagne on the other hand was well layered and beautiful but only tasted decent. Maybe it's my need for cheese, but I was not completely fulfilled. With that said the salad and bread it came with were wonderful and I got to use the olive oil and balsamic :)
Oh, they also ask if you want fresh ground pepper - which comes out like powdered pepper and our server gave us a SUPER C*AP LOAD of it. But it didn't taste too peppery. Maybe it was white pepper? I don't know. 
The chocolate cake was divine and once slice between the two of us was more than plenty.
All in all, a good restaurant, and if I lived in T I would def. be back. During the four hours that we hung out there, there were about 5 different parties that came in, mostly for coffee and dessert type things, and I could see that the servers were super nice to them, young and old. Even going out of their way to open the door and walk outside for the old man in an electronic chair thingymabob. 

Maybe I shouldn't give it five stars but we hung out for 4 hours and they did not bat an eye. That's good in my books."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our brunch. Unfortunately we discovered this little gem that reminded us if our time in Italy on our last day in Toronto. Definitely worth checking out if in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Wow, I was so pleasantly surprised when I stopped by Portici for dinner earlier this week! Their special that night was $10 for any of their pizzas and it was so worth it! I had the Nepoletana pizza and it was magnificent. The tomato sauce was creamy and the crust was the perfect density- on the thinner side, just the way I l like it. It was also a decent enough size to fill you up, ~12 inches. The servers were also very pleasant and did a great job attending to us. The space is a little small since it is a cafe, but they have a nice little patio which is perfect for the summer. I definitely recommend this spot for a delicious Italian bite near Yorkville that wont dent your wallet :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic cafe, great secret little spot. By far the best and most reasonably priced Italian food in the Yorkville area. Pizza and paninis are delicious, and the perfect size to share. Excellent coffee; coffee cakes are AMAZING!,"}
{"text":"Ordered nacho pizza and spagetti bolognese + mochas
Nacho pizza was good for two people if sharing. Falls apart easily tho, toppings were very small...i saw the tiniest bits of avocado ever in my life. Would be tastier if the toppings were a bit noticeable. The two menus were really confusing, one being the lunch/happy hour menu and the other being regular (too small of a selection) However it is a cafe so I don't blame them for keeping it small. Mochas were good and decent size. The spagetti was ok...nothing to rave about. 

The only negatives were the service was pretty slow. Took awhile to get our mochas made even tho there weren't a lot of diners. 

Overall, i would return."}
{"text":"Amazing! A taste of real Italian food in your plate! I ordered the pizza and I had the pleasure to be served a REAL pizza (not the American sh*** we find everywhere!) with real ingredients and for a decent price. 
Service is awesome and they really take care of the customers! 
I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty great atmosphere. Loved the decor of bottles juice on the window-sill. Really welcoming place with friendly servers.

Food wasn't the largest but I could tell it was made pretty delicately. Lasagna was pretty disappointing, the salad was meh, and the pizza was pretty good.

On the edge of 3 stars, but I gave in to the atmosphere and pizza."}
{"text":"4.5 stars due to slow service even though it wasn't busy. Although, only had one super friendly server and one cook. A bit pricey (not too pricey) but the place is clean, the food is made to order and they take their time to make sure your table gets the proper set up.  My husband and I ordered the bruschetta, fortini pizza and 2 pops for $35 with tip. The food is fresh and light so you don't feel heavy and gross after you've finished your meal.  I would go back to try their other pizzas, pastas and paninis. The place is hidden so you wouldn't know it was there, so google map it (street view). Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  And their meatballs were awesome but small.  The prices are really good there too, especially on the days they have their specials!"}
{"text":"This is Yorkville, so come with the assumption that your food will take at least an hour to arrive. Needless to say, unimpressed as we informed them beforehand that we're here on a tight lunch hour...

My co-workers ordered soup to go (that consists of scooping out of the pot into a carton) and that took twenty minutes ... 

Food itself was ok - I expect more from a Neapolitan. My margherita didn't come with the extra basil I asked and was charged for (unless they normally put on two leaves!) And the \"fresh mozzarella\" looked like regular pizza cheese. The \"fresh garlic\" also reminiscent of minced garlic in a jar... For crying out loud!

The server had to ask me 3 times what I was saying when I said \"basil\" and didn't bring boxes though I asked 4 times. Also, they brought subpar oil/balsamic but no bread, even with or after the meal! 

Won't repeat. Worth saying my co-workers enjoyed their meals. Not the timing or service... Not to mention they forgot to give us the 15% discount they've stated is applicable to anyone from our company :)

Edit: I find the establishment's violently dismissive response to this negative review ghastly. Not a way for a business to respond positively to a negative experience, which I would have welcomed."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a saturday and it wasn't too busy. The frittata was decent, but a little on the salty side. Great service and very friendly staff. They're also stroller friendly which was great for my friend"}
{"text":"Ditto with the other reviews here -- it's is a pretty simple looking place, but the service is amazing and the pizza is good.  Definitely on the healthy side of Italian -- had bruschetta and pizza, both which were fresh and light."}
{"text":"I had some time to waste while waiting for an appointment but it was too early to have dinner. I just needed something light to bridge the gap. I remember walking past Caffe di Portici a few weeks ago so I thought I'd see what they have.

Oh, I thought this was a coffee shop. It's much more than that! It's an Italian restaurant that happens to serve coffee. They serve all kinds of Italian food here, including salad, pasta, sandwiches, pizza, desserts, and much more. All I want is a coffee, this time.

My friendly server had actually greeted me before I stepped inside and was very helpful in walking me through their menu. With his help, I chose the Espresso Crema Shakerato - A layer of cold milk cream over iced coffee frothed in a shaker & flavour shot. It sounded really good on a hot day. It was good! Rich and creamy.

I'll have to come back to try some of their food."}
{"text":"As the official Yelp Dutchess of this establishment, I do have a HUGE COMPLAINT.

first of all, let me say that we came here a couple days ago and received wonderful treatment from the server- sorry I forgot his name... The margarita pizza was  absolutely wonderful and was at our table fairly quickly. 
We actually compared the taste to that at Emerils in Las Vegas. Delicious.  We were  surprised at the negative reviews.

Today we grabbed a juice in an unmarked plastic cup and decided to eat here again.  My cup of orange juice was half full.  We ordered  the pizza again.  Two minutes later, the waitress tells me that  I am not aloud to have my juice here. I can either throw it away or they can hide it behind the counter. Seriously? We just ordered a $15 pizza outside on the patio and I can't drink my juice.  I was told Starbucks wouldn't allow me to bring anything in there-- which is funny because just yesterday, I walked into Starbucks with my husband with a bottled water while he ordered an iced coffee. No one said anything. 

I guess they aren't concerned about my business because they put my juice into a glass and threw away the container. 

As much as I love the pizza, we will not be back, and tonight when I return to my group of 50 that we are here with, I will let them know. 

My five star rating turned into a 1 just like that. 

It's sad some people lack good business sense."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden neighbourhood gem. We ordered the Quattro formaggi and capricciosa. Both were delicious and very similar to the pizzas I had in Italy. I will definitely be back again for the quattro formaggi pizza!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great margarita pizza with cherry tomatoes. We loved loved loved it so much on our first visit we made a special visit on our last day in Toronto. 

Excitedly we ordered our pizza and anxiously waited for the Emeril \"like\" pizza. 

Shortly, and abruptly, the waitress informed my wife she couldn't finish her drink that we bought while walking to this restaurant. She would need to throw it away or leave. My choice was to leave, but my wife sought out a manager. They agreed to place her remaining drink in a glass. Great logic - and awful customer policy. 

Worse than anything was that it is Saturday, and there is almost nobody here on porch. (See photo). Inside has no customers.   

Dear management, figure out this customer service piece out or you will likely not be here at our next visit!"}
{"text":"This cute cafe in Yorkville seems like the perfect spot for lunch or coffee - especially if you feel like chatting for hours. The simple menu items seem priced reasonably and everything we ordered was delicious - fresh and prepared beautifully. I'd love to check out the patio in warmer weather! Bathrooms are very clean - always a good sign."}
{"text":"Good pizza and sandwich place! Great location in my favorite spot of the city! My pizza tasted great and the smoothie was delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing European style cafe - I have probably been here upwards of 20 times with my girlfriend for their daily specials and coffees. The ambience is amazing, the staff are excellent (for the most part) and the owner is a great guy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The tastiest and most authentic Italian pizza you can get around here. I live across the street from this place and absolutely love it. Every meal is a delight. Great espresso. Tiramisu is home-made and served in cute little jars of joy  
I also love their ham and cheese croissant. 
The only thing I would change about this place is that I would serve Americano in a mug rather than a clear glass. 
One last note: They let your dog sit on the patio with you"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch there with my family. The warm autumn salad with pecans, goat cheese and pomegranate seeds was tasty (just maybe a tiny bit overdressed). The servers were super friendly and didn't seem to mind my 5 month-old niece's crying. If you're looking for a laid-back place to hangout for a bite or a cup of espresso in Yorkville, Portici is the place."}
{"text":"This place is great. Its small size gives it a special vibe, and makes it all the more interesting. It's fascinating how they make use of their almost kitchenette-sized kitchen.

I had brunch here today, my second visit to Caffe di Portici. I had the Salmone Special (I think that was the name), which consisted of  smoked salmon with cream cheese and dill in a baguette. I really enjoyed it.

My friends and I were impressed by the presentation, and how different each plate was. My meal came with a chickpea and bean salad, for example. My one friend had diced potatoes instead, while the other guy had something else entirely. Many restaurants I find go the lazy route and use the same sides in many dishes.

I genuinely recommend this restaurant. The staff are friendly, the food is great and the environment is exceptional."}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this restaurant specially because of where it is located. Maybe that is not fair, but really, I should not have had to do the following:

1) Clean my chair because it was full of crumbs and dried food
2) Clean the table of the same things noted in #1

On Mondays and Tuesdays beers and wines are approximately $5 so I guess that is a decent deal. A food item that people seem to love at this restaurant are their pizzas. So I ordered a Marguerita to share with my friend. We actually got the pizza quickly and it was steaming hot. The first bite was delicious because it tasted fresh and warm. By the time I got to the 2nd slice, it had cooled down and become hard, and by the time I finished the 2nd slice, my friend and I stared at the single slice left, and neither of us picked it up. We were not impressed so we left the last slice behind. 

I do not get all the hype for this place."}
{"text":"Just a quick yelp to say this place is really great. I've been twice, the staff is super nice and remembered my son and I (and what we ordered) 2 weeks later. Really enjoy their thin crust pizza, the spinach salad was fantastic, and if you go after 9 pm beers and 5oz glass of wine are only $5.50! And any pizza just $13.50. A real neighborhood find."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot on a sunny day. This place is brilliant. Slightly off the beaten track in Yorkville otherwise I imagine it would already have been highly yelped.

It's a nice corner location and they have quite a bit of outdoor patio seating plus a few tables inside. It has a very authentic European feel to it and reminds me of some of the cafes I visited in northern Italy. Big red/white patio umbrellas and chairs! Extremely clean.

The staff is extremely friendly. They have some pastas, pizzas, paninis and salads. Everything is priced around $10 (between $9-$12 for the most part). 

I tried a caprese salad (roasted peppers, tomatoes, fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella) for $10.95. Portion was substantial and the mozzarella was to die for. I also had an espresso macchiato ($2.75) which hit the spot quite nicely."}
{"text":"Eating around Yorkville can sometime be a dawning task. Most places would charge $$$$ for a simple meal.  But if you are looking for a nice little corner cafe that serves up some fancy yummy food without the heavy price tag, wait no more! Caffe Di Portici is your kinda Resturant!  

Highlight of the visit:
Brunch pizza! Any of the pizza are super yummy. They are thin crust and cooked to perfection.  Especially when Rami, the head French chef hits up behind the oven.  He's very friendly and often comes to tables for their feedback.  This place is my go to for a quick brunch or after work hangout!

{"text":"Excellent Italian pizza. I came here for a birthday and we shared a margarita pizza. When asked for soda water, we were brought over a bottle. Not until we got the bill did we see that we were charged $8 for this water. Say what?! Why were we not informed that this was premium water? Despite being overcharged, we still loved the pizza and would come back. Pro-tip: Skip the fizzy drinks and just order water. You'll save an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"I work across the street from Caffe Di Portici, and absolutely love this cafe. I have had dinner at the cafe twice, and come in at least three times a week for coffee or food. My coworkers love this cafe, and my dinner guests have been thoroughly impressed by the food and service we have received.
 
Both during the day time, and night time, the cafe is cozy, warm, inviting, upscale, and comfortable. Great place for evening drinks, or a date. The patio on a sunny day, or a warm evening, is an absolute delight.
 
As for specifics, the pizza is some of the best I have ever had! Thin crust, with the perfect combination of toppings and sauces. The desserts are rich and delicious,  the coffee and refreshments are perfect, and the owner and employees are warm, gracious, and diligent."}
{"text":"lovely coffee and pizza okace. Cannot believe they offer free coffee even latte or cappuccino to Rituals customer. Lavazza coffee was always a great hit."}
{"text":"Tired of the uppity atmosphere abundant in many of Yorkville's finer dining establishments? Well then, my friends, you must check out Caffe di Portici, the best place for simple and delicious Italian that no one has heard about yet. It's an easy place to overlook. Although it's basically at the corner of Yonge & Davenport and totally accessible, it's on Scollard, a street most people don't tend to walk down unless they live on it. And from the outside, admittedly, it looks like just another run-of-the-mill, mediocre cafe. I live in front of the darn thing and it took me months before I finally decided to check it out just because I was too lazy to walk into Yorkville that day - but when I did I was blown away by the lovely fresh simplicity of the ingredients (oh the bufala mozzarella in their caprese salad!!), the tastiness of their pasta-of-the-day specials (omg the pasta fagioli!), the perfect crisp of the bread they serve you on the side and in their paninis.  Definitely a place to check out and fall in love with when you're in the mood for a no-fuss, pretty affordable and dang satisfying meal."}
