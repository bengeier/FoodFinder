{"text":"Decided on a whim to give these guys another chance today, and I'm pleased to say they redeemed themselves somewhat.

This time I had two of their 100% beef hot dogs, which were excellent. The rolls were fresh and perfectly toasted, and they got my toppings right. I also had a side of the Aero Fries, and they were considerably better this time than when I first went- crispier and more flavorful. Service was very friendly (though a bit on the slow side).

I'll still be steering clear of the dressing-soaked burgers, but their hot dogs get the thumbs up. My only complaint is the price, which is a little high- over $9 for two dogs and a small fries (no drink) is a bit excessive. Still, I suppose it's on par with places like Five Guys.

Well done, Topz- you changed my mind."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Topz a number of times and do not find their aero fries to be tasteless like some of the reviewers have suggested. I think they're great and the fact that they are baked and not fried is terrific. I really enjoyed the Asian Chicken Salad and my husband loved the salmon. Burgers are great too.  Everything we've had gets an A+."}
{"text":"Solid place to get a burger. I stopped in here thanks to a Groupon but they also have a coupon or two in the Citipass book. My beef with this place is it's one of those places where you walk in and are unsure about if you just wait there for your food or if you sit down and wait for them to bring it. So we sat and waited and the food finally came around. I got the turkey burger--succulent and hot off the grill-just the way I like it! They have lots of condiments to sample as well, include garlic ketchup-my new love!"}
{"text":"I am downgrading my review because EVERY TIME we order we have this nasty woman with a nasty attitude taking our order.  Seriously, I can't imagine why the owner keeps this woman around.  We have a miserable experience every time we go when she takes our order.  Enough to keep us away because she is such a pain in our @ss.  She bitched when we wanted to use a credit card (Do you KNOW how much this costs us for such a small order?! - NO and that is not something you say to a customer.)  She bitched when I asked to put the toppings on the side too.  EVERY TIME I order she says in a rude crackly voice \"You want the toppings on THE SIDE???\"   As if it is such a pain in her butt to do so."}
{"text":"This place prides itself for not using any deep fryers and is a trans-fat free restaurant.  I've been here a couple of times and it is actually pretty good.  I was wondering how different it would taste since they don't fry any of their food but everything was still pretty tasty.  I had the angus cheeseburger and the turkey burger another time.  They are pretty big burgers and prices aren't  too bad either, around $8 for a burger w/ fries and a drink.  The angus burger comes in either 1/4 lb or 1/2 lb (basically two 1/4 lb patties, not one huge patty) and served on a wheat bun.  The fries are \"aerobaked\" but are pretty good, maybe just a little dry compared to fries that are deep fried.  They have different types of condiments, like garlic ketchup!  I tried it and it was good but I could still taste the garlic in my mouth after I left!  There is also different flavored syrups that you can add to your pop/soda!  Overall, not my favorite burger joint but it is good if you're looking for a \"healthy\" burger!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Read the decent reviews and figured I would use my Groupon.  The burger was just not hitting it and I was very surprised the sweet potato fries were just, plain ole out the bag. The fancy name \" Aero Sweets\" made it seemed like they were homemade and cut. My friend had tried the mozzarella sticks and said they  taste fake cheesy and very breaded. I give places a chance, but I think I will not try this place again. I will say the girl taking the orders was very personable and the owner seemed to be a nice fellow."}
{"text":"CLOSED :(  Feel bad for the owners and employees...they were good people.  I think the location hurt them, as did Red Ventures moving to SC."}
{"text":"So I claim to be a health nut, but I certainly have cravings for a burger once in awhile.  I have been in search for the best burger in Charlotte (a perfect 10 burger is an In 'n' Out Double Double) and figured I'd try Topz.  Granted I can't expect Topz to compare to In 'n' Out and I liked the option of a \"healthier\" burger.

I did get the all angus burger on a healthy wheat bun, but felt the burger was average overall.  Nothing overly flavorful or juice about it.  On top of that, a side option was fries, which is imperative to have with a burger.  The fries were average too.  I noticed them taking the pre-cut fries out of a manufacturer's bag.  Sigh.

Overall, my impression of Topz was average.  I'm disappointed because I thought it would be a great alternative by having a \"healthier\" burger, but I think when you get a burger, you have to throw health out the window.  Heart-attack, here I come.  I'd do Five Guys or Big Daddy's before Topz."}
{"text":"The place was clean, and the food is fresh, I just thought it lacked flavor.  I'm sure baked fries are better for you, but as expected they just don't taste as good.

The other problem I had was the cashier was taking orders and bringing out the food.  I saw her adjust a bun on a plate she was bringing out, but she wasn't washing her hands between taking the money and delivering the food.  I'm sure this is not the norm, but it caught my eye."}
{"text":"Just for being a burger joint that offers whole wheat buns, baked, \"aero\", potato and sweet potato fries, and baked onion rings gives it an extra star in my book.  My turkey burger was moist and tasty.  My wife's salad looked good, too.  The place was very clean, and the prices were decent, $4.95 for my 1/3 lb turkey burger, although the serving size of my $2.10 sweet potato fries was small, but I did like them.  I don't know why more places can't offer something as simple as a whole wheat bun.  Wanna burger and fries (are they still fries when they're baked?) w/ out so much bad to it?  Give Topz a try."}
