{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean style food, nice ambience, cool artwork on the walls, friendly staff -- I hope they can keep up the high standards.  We were a party of 5 and went rather late on Sat. night.  We got great service and enjoyed the reverse happy hour specials (try both shrimp items...) along with a range of pita sandwiches, a salad and the shrimp skewers.  The one item that could have been better was the mushroom pita, which was rather soggy."}
{"text":"Our service sucked from the get-go. I walked in with my friend and the guy (who apparently was the only one there?) Looked super annoyed to see us. Yelled from across the room that we could sit where ever. Placed the menus on our table and ran off. When we paid our bill, my friend waited and waited for her change. The server ASSUMED that was his tip. When she asked for her change he gave her the rudest loom, rolled his eyes then gave her her change.   Yikes! 3 stars because the food was actually yummy."}
{"text":"Had the stuffed mozzarella burger and it was great, served on a buttered bun. Red pepper hummus was tasty and had a great texture to it. Shrimp skewer very tasty but rice could have used a bit of kick (more lemon?) Service was attentive thanks to Anthony. Will come back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and the cocktails are excellent. We had dinner last night and Midori waited on us. The service and food were excellent. You have to sign up for their VIP club as the specials are great. Last night we had a great bottle of wine along with an appetizer for only $15. We will be visiting more often!"}
{"text":"Food was good, although $22 for flank steak is a little much, it had good flavor, but I ordered medium rare and got well done. The club sandwich was really good and more reasonably priced. Our waitress was friendly, but did not have much knowledge of the menu. She had never tasted any of the items we asked about, stating \"that's to expensive for me to taste\" which I guess means she has to pay for her own dinners.   Owners: I don't blame the waitress for her lack of menu knowledge...I blame you. Your staff should try every menu item in training so they can sell it.   I would go back again. The lunch menu is available for dinner too if your not looking to spend $15+ per person on dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place! The staff is so friendly and down to earth. Their patio is amazing, great ambience and dog friendly! We always take our husky and boarder collie with us if we are eating there. Their kitchen does close at 9 pm on the weekdays and 10 on the weekend, so don't be mislead for late night eats. But their food never disappoints, can't go wrong with the club, skewers or pitas! Great bar tenders and wine selections!"}
{"text":"I brought my work peeps there for a birthday lunch.    The food was excellent - lamb, chicken skewers and shrimp. The spanakopita and hummus appetizers were wonderful.  The homemade Sangria was some of the best I've had.  The service was quick and charming from our waiter Nicholas who had an accent that made us giddier than the Sangria. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tonight was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in some time.  First of all, we had 20+ people, and only one server assigned even though the restaurant was nearly empty.   Food came out over the course of 45 minutes.  Literally the first person was done for 15-20 mins before the last one got the meal.   This is the second time we have given this local restaurant a chance.  Last time it was a 50 top, and service was identical.   Maybe they are great for small groups, but will not come back with more than 6 people ever again.    I hope they take feedback seriously and incorporate changes."}
{"text":"Very nice ambient ( live music on Friday and Saturday) .  I think is a very good place to hang out with friends for drinks. Food is not so good. I ordered the lamb chop ( request for medium) , but only 1 lamb chop is in medium, the rest are almost well done. The lamb chop donot have any seasoning, taste so plain. My husband had the flank steak, same here, do not have any seasoning on the meat ( the dish just has some balsamic sauce drizzle on the plate ) , my children had the pasta dish with shrimps, is only ok. We had the eggplant dish with shrimps and bruschetta for appetizer ,  not the dish after you eat,  you will want to have more. Overall, i will go back there just for drinks/ cocktails ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, such a great ambiance and tasty food! Anthony was our server and he was so helpful! We really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"The Ivy not only offers great food, they offer amazing service! I am lucky enough to live directly across the street from The Ivy. Every time I come in they make me feel like part of the gang. They have a great private room that I've used twice for personal parties. They've never hesitated to allow us to do individual checks in large groups. I highly recommend The Ivy!"}
{"text":"A little expensive but food is very good! Staff was friendly and attentive. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"UPDATE alright, so I guess I spoke too soon with writing this review. The day finally came for our rehearsal brunch to happen. We arrived and they seemed ready for us and got us all sated quickly. However things quickly went downhill. It took forever to get any drinks and our orders because they also booked a second party in the restaurants but did not staff accordingly. Only half the people got their drinks and many were served wrong drinks. Same happened with entrees: there was probably 20-30 minutes in between when the first person was served and when the last person was. It was embarrassing to being our guests to this restaurant for them to be treated so poorly. All in all, the food is good and the staff is nice, they just aren't equipped to handle large parties and I made that mistake I guess."}
{"text":"Will not go back,  salad really over dressed and the fries disgusting with so much feta on top.  Saw one of the waitresses wipe her nose with the back of her hand and then serve salads with her fingers in the bowl."}
{"text":"I want to take their Ivy Fries behind the middle school and get them pregnant.  Long story short, the lamb gyro is pretty much perfect. The right amount of medium rare lamb with the right amount of char. Tomatp, cucumber, and tzaziki to balance it out. I've yet to try a salad that I didn't enjoy. The muscles in marinara have Sopprasetta in the sauce adding a perfect salty bite. And again, the Ivy Fries. Oh, my, god...the I've Fries.  Not to mention that Brandon, Chris, and Killer are the trifecta of awesome, entertaining, and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 6 on a Sunday. We called the hour before to ask if we needed a reservation but they said we didn't. When we arrived no one greeted us at the door.after a couple of minutes the bartender shouted from behind the bar if we needed to be seated.once seated no one gave us menus or greeted us. After 5 minutes, a woman told us it was just her and the bartender and they were too busy to take our drink orders at the moment. We waited another 10 minutes while nobody did anything to help us and then asked the bartender if we should leave. He told us to hold on, then walked in the back and did not come back so we left. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Used to be urban fusion place. The  hummus is good, good service. The Ivy club is really good. The Salmon in the salad is perfect. The waitress is excellent."}
{"text":"Great patio and happy hour. Pricey for lunch or dinner though. Live going in winter months to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first meal here. The Ivy fries are delicious. I am looking forward to coming back with my hubby FR a date night when the weather is cooler and we can sit on n patio. This is a fairly small place and seating is limited inside but the ambiance was relaxing and good for date night."}
{"text":"My grandfather and I dined in at The Ivy Mediterranean  Lounge on Thursday 9/15 for lunch and it did not disappoint! They offered a good range of pita breads gyro's, appetizers, and entrees. Most of the options did include meat, which was a bit difficult tor me seeing as I am a vegetarian, but the menu did offer a pita gyro with portobello mushrooms instead of meat, which was great! I also ordered the Ivy fries appetizer to go along with my gyro, and they were great! They were a greek style of fries, made with a lemon sauce and feta cheese, all combining to make a great dish!  As for the service, our waitress was nice enough, I did not get her name and she seemed to be kind of busy. She didn't check up on us often except to take our orders, drop off the food, and when we were finished. It wasn't too busy in the restaurant but it did seem she had a large section, and I working in a restaurant myself understood the pressure a large section may come with. I was a little disappointed that my water didn't get refilled until just before I left, leaving the glass empty for most of my meal.  Finally I come to the decor. The patio we walked through upon entry was gorgeous, a large spacious area with lots of trees and cozy furniture. When I entered, the decor inside was lovely as well. It was a modern greek style decor, making the space large and spacious. The colors were light and airy, providing a calm setting. From the table I was seated at I was able to catch a glimpse at their private dining room, decorated with a blue Mediterranean style tile along the back wall, making an exotic and eye catching setting. Overall I had a good experience at the Ivy and would recommend it to anyone looking for an exotic and cultural restaurant to dine at."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio with a large party on a Friday night at 7:00.   Pros: good food and menu selection, decent food pricing. Decent wine selection. Music on Friday and Saturday nights, waitresses were friendly, the food came out really fast.    Cons: they don't have their misters working  which is a shame because their patio is beautiful. They don't pipe the live music playing inside to the outside. In fact, when he was playing there was no music outside, but when he was on a break they turned music on. The patio could be the best patio in that area if only they paid attention to a few small details. Drink orders took a while coming out and wine was not served in a wine glass. Disappointed a manager didn't come out to check on our large party. Good customer service goes a long way these days.  We had appetizers but couldn't eat it for a long time because we didn't have plates or silverware. For some reason they didn't think they needed more than one waitress for our party with at least 25 people.  Drink prices were priced high during non happy hour ($11 for a glass of wine which is the same as my $12 salad!) for one person, $30 is a high price to pay!!  I'd give it another try with a smaller group or a dinner with my husband during happy hour time only."}
{"text":"Great time at The Ivy. Love the ambience inside the restaurant. The bar area has great lighting and very comfortable living room-like seating. Good place for after work happy hour.  Family friendly as well. Patio is great. Lots of comfortable couches and chairs. Even more importantly,  I have to say the food won't disappoint. I've eaten there twice already and can't seem to resist the fish tacos. Amazing! Very fresh and light. I plan on frequenting this place as much as possible."}
{"text":"I though that the food and drinks were great! The night we were there they had a great DJ and the ambiance was fantastic.  Chandler needed a place like this."}
{"text":"Great new addition to chandler community. Highly recommend the sea bass it was awesome. Only been here twice but all the food has been over the top from the hummus to the calamari. We will be back again and again. Thanks Christos, Ryan and Dan for inviting us!"}
{"text":"Meh. I REALLY wanted to like this place since we live within walking distance and frequent this plaza at least 1-2 times a month for good eats. I've been there once for lunch, once for dinner and once for happy hour with girlfriends.  Each time left me more unimpressed than the last.   On the positive side, it's a great location and the patio is awesome...just wish the service and food was up to par. I'm sure we will keep trying every once in a while since it is a family owned local business that we favor supporting over chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I am glad we found a new place for dinner. The review says casual but I think I will try to dress up a little next time. The ambience seemed more of a date night romantic setting. It is nicely decorated and the high top chairs we sat in were quite comfortable. To add a note, I probably would not bring any kids.   We were worried that we were not going to have good service but we were pleasantly surprised. There were only two servers. They were running the bar, busing the tables and taking orders.   I saw the eggplant and shrimp on the menu before hand and had my mind set on that for an appetizer. It was delicious. Looked even better then the picture!  The eggplant was sliced thin with a great crisp and the sauce was wonderful.   I ordered a Greek salad with fried calamari. The salad was great, better then the Greek salad I had the night before at Pitta Souvli. The calamari was a little hard. Still debating if I will add that again.   Honey had the pesto pasta with chicken. He did have to ask for some salt which was not on the table.  I did ask him if he would order it again and he said, \"Yes.\" Of course I took a bite. I think I would've liked the little fresh Parmesan.   Overall we were very pleased and we will be back. I also read that the owner has another restaurant which we've seen and never tried so now we will."}
{"text":"We were there for the first time on a Saturday night. The only negative was slightly slow service. The ambiance was nice, and the seating was not crowded. There was an acoustic singer-guitarist who was not overly loud, so we were able to carry on conversations.  The food was outstanding. We were a party of eight, and all had something different and everything was delicious. The appetizers were nice sized portions and scrumptious.  Our server was accommodating (we're all seniors with a lot of dietary needs). The word \"NO\" was not in their vocabulary. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went about 6:30 on a Saturday. It took almost an hour from the time we walked into the restaurant until our salad arrived. It was a while longer before the meals arrived. The shrimp in my wife's meal (shrimp skewers) was cold. By the time the meals arrived waitstaff had started to put drinks for another table on our table and actually delivered meals for the next table over to our table and left them. Since one was what was ordered there was a thought that they had just mixed out one order. They took the meals and gave to the next table. I would not have wanted to eat a meal that had been on someone else's table.  Why would I possibly want to go back???"}
{"text":"I went there last Friday at dinner time for a drink and quick bite to eat at the bar. I ordered the shrimp and eggplant, it tasted very well, service was good and the staff was friendly. Every table inside the restaurant was filled. The music was at an appropriate level giving me the ability to carry a conversation. The manager greeted me when I walked in. I enjoyed my evening and I will defiantly go back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food!! The gyros was great and the taziki sauce amazing.  The lemon Greek fries were heavenly.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great Happy Hour. Looking forward to coming back. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"A must try is the shrimp with eggplant. It's absolutely amazing!  Large shrimp and the best sauce over thin sliced breaded eggplant. Don't miss the chicken satay. The sauce makes it!  Just the right amount of lemon and spices. The craft made cocktails are also something not to pass on. Great atmosphere and service!!  Will be be back again and again! You must try!"}
{"text":"Soo, it was our first time here. My boyfriend and I went for our date night. The host told us to sit were ever we pleased. Of course we choose the outdoor seating to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather. We ended up sitting at the outdoor bar. The bartender (Chelsea I believe was her name. She had Maroun hair color) was amazing. We expressed that it was our first time there and asked what she recommended. We decided on the mussel and shrimp appetizers. Then ordered the lamb skeweres but mistakenly ended up with shrimp. We were not even mad. All the food was #AMAZING #absolutely#delicious. We even ended up with the lamb ones after we told them we originally ordered them  with no charge. The atmosphere was great and they had a live band. After the band left they had great music playing.  The only reason why I gave them 4 stars was because the owners were sitting next to us at the bar and they were very loud and had foul mouths. The husband was drunk on one side of the bar and wife was on the other yelling across to him. We were turned off by that. I am sure they mean well but was not our cup of tea to listen to drink people swearing and yelling. When they finally grabbed their uber and left the rest of the night was quite pleasant. I recommend going and trying it out totally worth it."}
{"text":"Brandon is amazing and took care of us all night long. We got to known him like family. We joked and laughed and enjoyed every minute of it. He was as funny as he was amazing! This was a phenomenal experience and the food was fantastic! He entertained us all night and put up with all our ridiculousness! Fireball and bottles and bottles of delicious wine later he still was entertaining us with stories and still providing exceptional service. A man who has earned accolades in his position, I hope his employees are as impressed. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the pear salad. It was very bland and nothing special. A plain grilled chicken breast over a bed of dry mixed greens. Then I realized the gorgonzola cheese was missing. A serving of cheese was brought out which helped the salad with flavor, but it was all a dry mess."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot in Chandler! The service is good and food was tasty. A coworker and I ordered takeout for lunch. We got the mozzarella burger and buffalo chicken sandwich. The burger was actually a stuffed burger and cheese came oozing out as we cut into it. YUM!!! The buffalo sauce was awesome! It actually had celery bits mixed in. The chicken itself was ok...a little thin and tough. Oddly enough, this grade of chicken seems to be quite common amongst many local spots. Personally, I prefer more of a thicker and juicer cut. The deduction in 1 star doesn't come from the chicken, it comes from the bill. Both meals are $10 each. I called in prior to ordering to verify the cost of upgrading the fries (which are included) to Ivy fries (AKA Greek fries). The gentleman confirmed that it would be a 50 cent upgrade per meal ($1 total) to get the Ivy fries. When I called in to actually place the order, the girl confirmed the total at $21 and change. When my coworker picked up the food I noticed the bill was $28. I looked at the receipt and sure enough, we were charged $6 for Ivy fries. Needless to say, I was a little bummed out. Will I eat here again, you better believe it!!"}
{"text":"We made reservations on the patio with a very large group.  The service was fantastic.  Ivy Fries are amazing and a must with any order.  From the hostess to the manager, the staff is helpful and efficient.  FYI- the lunch section on the menu is available for dinner as well."}
{"text":"The humus platter is delicious. We also had the shrimp and eggplant which was amazing. I highly recommend the fish tacos they are out of this world. Do not forget the dessert either, the chocolate lava cake is to die for. Absolutely amazing food. Great service and all around a wonderful place!!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat hidden behind Nandos, located in the same building so be sure to drive around to see it! The remodel on this place is awesome, very trendy and sophisticated. Because I'm obsessed with spicy seafood marinara pasta, I ordered the spicy mussels and added angel hair pasta. The mussels were buttery, melt in your mouth good! They tasted very fresh. I was hoping for a more 'brothy' spicy sauce over the thick marinara but the mussels were so good it didn't matter. My husband ordered the Greek pita and he inhaled the sandwich he loved it that much. We shared some Greek fries that have lemon and feta on them that were amazing too. For dessert we had tirimisu which did not disappoint! We are coming back! If u love Greek them eat here!"}
{"text":"How lucky we are to have this excellent addition to our community. I love going with my women friends and sharing appetizers, salads, and entrees. Everything is delicious and servers are very pleasant. I would be thrilled to see the chef add a few fish didshes to the menu. Their Greek seasoning would be perfect."}
{"text":"Try the shrimp app and chicken skewer entree, it's good AF! Bonnie was our server and she was great, we will be back. The live music made for a great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"We live within walking distance, so we visit this establishment often. It's one of our favorite restaurants. It has an upscale but casual ambience. The staff is experienced, helpful and friendly. The entrees like the shrimp or lamb skewers are so so. We usually go for the salads, appetizers, hummus, and an occasional pita sandwich. The Greek salad and Pear salad are large, shareable and consistently delicious. Appetizers like the hummus and the shrimp Mediteranio are always a good choice. Wine selection is good, slightly pricey, but are half price per bottle on Sundays. Cocktails, especially like a martini with their decent house brand, are generous and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have hosted several events in their beautiful space and had happy hours. The manager, Chris and his staff are always so welcoming & accommodating. The food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and stopped with our infant and grandparents. The service was fabulous, they were very accommodating with anything we asked. The food was very good. The gyro I had was one of the best I've had. Plus they have unsweetened ice tea which always makes me happy. I'd definitely recommend and return to The Ivy."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and staff and have been here multiple times. Only reason for not giving five stars is the amount of time it usually takes for the food to come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Two stars because at least someone acknowledged I barely touched my chicken salad....slow service and food was less than appealing...and I was starving!  Food came out faster than I was greeted by my server.  Not only did the chicken taste microwaves it had a disgusting flavor to it. Pear vinaigrette dressing is what sold me on this choice...tasted like straight up balsamic vinegar.   When I tried to pay my bill....which took forever to get acknowledged...I mentioned I didn't care for my practically untouched salad and the server grabbed my credit card and walked away.  Only when the - I assume - manager walked over to clear my plate did anyone care of my dissatisfaction. I should've went with my gut and turned around and walked out when I stood at the front door for five minutes and there were only two tables in the restaurant at 1:15pm."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Amazing ambiance, our server was excelente, the food was great! I recommend the butternut squash ravioli, but menu is also very diverse."}
{"text":"The Bad  This is a review for Saturday 2/3/2018.   I totally agree with Walter R.  about the service.  Scroll down for his review.    The service was at best indifferent.  I had to go to the bar to get my iced tea refilled and there were only about 20 people in there.   Then our \"server\" just filled my glass with warm tea and no ice.   Later when she brought the food.  I believe the next time we saw anybody that worked there was when we got our check.    The Good  We were big fans of the now closed (and I believe related) Cyprus Grill.  It is funny that the \"server\" described the IVY as more upscale.  It aint!  The food was good, my gyro was excellent.  The Greek salad was a B-.  Wrong dressing, glad I got it on the side.  The wife had the chicken skewer meal.  She gave it high marks (Yes both were a bit more expensive than the Cyprus Grill.    They have great Iced Tea - both blends are great but I preferred the black.   The Ugly (see what I did there?)    OK this place is clean and yet not clean.  The vinyl benches were kinda disgusting.  The walls behind the benches could use a good wash.    It is not a reason to not go back there.  Silverware, glasses, general appearance was good.  Perhaps had the sun not been shining directly on the bench and wall it would not be visible.   I will go there again.  The food is good and that is what it is about.  Look, I don't need to have somebody talk to us the entire meal, but a check in or two would be nice.    Anyway, my wife and I argued because she gave Taylor a  20 percent tip.  I was annoyed by having to get my own tea in an almost empty restaurant. Also the have a way overdone website (somebody likes toys and the \"attempt\" to be fine dining.  Comes off as snobby for a place that sells gyros.   So when we come back please don;t do anything to the food because of this review.  The next one could be more..."}
{"text":"No parking, waitress didn't know drinks (wine) for happy hour, meat was overcooked both the lamb skewer and flank steak (very dry) and to top it off, waitress overcharged my glass of wine! Never going back!"}
{"text":"The Ivy has the best Mediterranean food ever!!! My friends Hailey, Nicole and I have been dying to try something new. Mediterranean food has never been my favorite but were a frisky bunch so we decided to try it again, and boy was I glad. Give it a try if you're feeling adventurous!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my shrimp and eggplant small plate which didn't seem like a small plate. Service could use a little attention...empty water glass."}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations based on previous reviews by other users, but it didn't turn out that way. We went here for a Valentines Day supper expecting top notch food.   For appy's we ordered sautéed shrimp and a pastry dish. Both dishes were lukewarm when they were brought to the table. They were also so bland, it was as if there was no spices used or any creativity to the preparation. The same tasting food can be made out of a frozen store bought bag at home.   For our meal we chose to go with the flank steak plate, again, expecting a top notch dish based on reviews. Not sure if it was a different chef or what but it was one of the most mediocre steak dishes. The steak was chewy and bland, and when we asked for a steak knife we were told the only knives available were the butter knives in our cutlery napkin. Which was odd considering the steak was so chewy and rubbery.   Just overall it was a bland experience. From the server to the food to the overall experience. It wouldn't be any different to having a steak dinner at an IHOP, that's how bland and tough it was and how generally unappealing this experience was.   We were pretty disappointed upon leaving last night."}
{"text":"Finally some more Greek in Chandler. Good for lunch. Decent service. Awkward restaurant   Why the heck did the owner accept this place with the bathrooms like this???? Who felt this is acceptable? Someone get some sense and REMODEL that crap!!! Yeah I want to squeeze into a closet with a urinal or a crapper. Wait until someone drops a load in the pisser!!! I  Guests expect accommodations.  - This place has bar seating and tables for 2. Just a feeling of awkward for families and groups.   Finally what I- D- I- O- T put ash trays in the patio seating area????  That is the LAST thing that customers want these days!!!! F$#%#*ing Smokers!!!!  Haven't restaurantpenuers figured out they get more from catering to nonsmokers because the smokers will find the ashtray on the outskirts of the building to feed their habit anyway.    BAN PATIO SMOKING PERMANENTLY."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food arrived cold but was quickly corrected after manager intervened. Other visits were very good so today was a little unexpected. Nevertheless we will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was fantastic!  It was the service that made this place not worth your time or money.  We made reservations for Mother's Day brunch, and were delighted to hear that Mother's eat free.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were promptly seated.  We then had to wait 15 minutes for drinks.  Our appetizer arrived about 20 minutes later, and the order was wrong.  They remade the dish, but we then waited an hour for our lunch.  The table next to us said the waited almost 2 hours for their food.  When the waiter brought us our bill, we were charged for the incorrect dish, and the Mother's meals.  When I told the waiter he took my dish off, and left my mother's dish on.  He then put $8 in cash in the table, and said that was for the wrong appetizer.  Very disappointing, I would say stay away from this pace on holidays and for brunch!  They do not have it together, and you will spend hours waiting to eat."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots for craft cocktails and Greek food in the Valley.  They have saganaki (flaming cheese) which is very hard to find and have it made well as well as an amazing craft cocktail called the Hops of Juniper where they combine gin with an IPA.  They also carry local spirits from a great local distillery, Adventurous Stills."}
{"text":"You would think it's hard to mess up a salad but they pulled it off. I ordered gyro, got chicken, ordered no onions and no olives, got both. In total dinner was over $50 and it was wrong. I expect this from taco bell, this is just sad."}
{"text":"Impressed with The Ivy. Great service, nice open patio, great decor and the food was very good. We had pita, lamb and salad. Fresh and well prepared. Will be back."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with high hopes. Being Greek myself, I expected something delectable.   Discovery: 1.) Walked in and no one greeted. It was busy, so did a self-seat. 10 minutes at the table, and no attendance from any staff. Finally had to go get someone... only after noticing the girls standing around talking.  2.) The waitress took the order. A standard gyro with lamb, cucumber and classic tzatziki sauce, and a Greek salad and a coke. Time until food arrived was good.  3.) The food: The lamb was over cooked, chewy, dry and over-grilled so the burnt taste really came through. Cucumber was chopped so finely, it lost its flavor. But the greatest disappointment was the tzatziki sauce. Watery and absolutely NO flavor.The watery sauce inevitably turned the bread to mush. As a final kicker, even the Coke was flavorless, nothing more than soda water with a smidgen of syrup and a load of ice (ordered the Coke for the Coke, not the ice). The only saving grace was the salad. However, it too had the flavorless cucumber.  SUMMARY: The place turned out a real disappointment. It's not much more than a typical bar/meet for happy hour kind of place. Hugely noisey, and fast food-dressed up as Mediterranean.  Pricing: $$ / Reasonable. Rating Scale is: Noms, Good, Meh, Bit Sick, Sick =  Final rating: Meh to Bit Sick Yelp rating: 1"}
{"text":"We recently had a party at The Ivy in their private dining room and I cannot begin to say enough great things about the restaurant and their staff! The amazing food was a bonus! Virginia and Taylor were our servers and Mac and Jacob assisted them. They were all amazing and attentive and provided us with exceptional service. The food was delicious and every one of our guests was so pleased with their meal option. We opted for an open menu for our 30 guests which can usually make it a little chaotic for the servers, but they handled everything so well and not once did they skip a beat. Our appetizers, drinks and main course were all brought out in a quick timely manner given the size of the party. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion. Whether it's lunch, happy hour, dinner or holding a large party, this place is outstanding! We will definitely be back and we are thrilled that our neighborhood has The Ivy!"}
{"text":"Music was too loud. we asked the manager but he was so rude. Service was also terrible. Staff was not professional at all. Never come back."}
{"text":"It was ok.  The place is a beautiful, although the patio faces busy Germann Rd, but very nice facility.  I was hoping to get a real Greek Salad, like you get in Greece, but alas, I guess that's just impossible here.  The salad I got was just pathetic.  But they did try and it wasn't a menu item so they get high marks for effort.  Next time I'll stick to the menu and let you know how it goes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, our server was quick and efficient. I like the ambience, lots of open space compared to most places so you didn't feel like you squeezed next to everyone else. And I definitely liked the menu, Mediterranean food is one of many styles I enjoy. The greek salad tasted just-picked fresh and had a tangy dressing, and the pita was soft and tasty. The only problem was the lamb in my pita, it wasn't seasoned very well at all, almost like no spice at all. I wanted to be a Chopped judge telling the contestant to salt the food properly. Having said this, the waiter brought over a brunch menu as we were leaving and the choices looked tempting. I'll go back sometime for weekend brunch or when they have live music, and if it's better I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Horrible place , horrible people , the food takes forever , the plates are under sized and the mangers are not even old enough to be mangers , the owners need to figure let there place before this people run it down, came in on a Friday and Saturday night and both nights were dead. The breakfast is ok they need to improve but the dinner needs a look at again. Like come on. Go eat somewhere else people"}
{"text":"The four of us ate outside at The Ivy on a beautiful May evening. The hostess seated us quickly, and ensured the table was clean. The service was timely, and since our waiter was Greek and looked like Jim from The Office, we had a very good interaction.  The Greek Fries were so tasty we ordered a second plate. I loved the shrimp skewers with a Greek side salad. My wife had the gyro salad and not only really liked it, but was impressed by the amount of meat in ot. We passed on dessert, but enjoyed relaxing on the patio after dinner. It was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Service - Loud obnoxious waiter. I felt like I was at a noisy sports bar, except I wasn't! Appetizers - Can you say bland and boring? We tried the calamari, red pepper hummus, regular hummus, shrimp with thick tomatoey sauce (like out of a can), crab cakes tasted like they were thawed from grocery store. Lamb skewers-Prepared medium rare and was the only thing that was made well. Ambiance-Meh. Trying to be upscale and chic...not so much!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I haven't had a bad meal yet there. Plus the patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Got here an hour til closing time and luckily the kitchen was still open. Pretty empty and dead as what you'd expect on a random weeknight. I'm not sure how fresh the food is as it only took 15 mins for our food to come out..but then again we were the only two customers eating dinner. Had fish tacos with ivy fries and bf had carbonara; fish tacos were okay, ivy fries were delish. Jamie our server was polite and we didn't feel rushed at all even though we got there near closing time. On the weekends they have live performances, will go here again when it's livelier."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour places in Chandler!  Every dish is amazing (Ik be I've tried almost every dish during happy hour )"}
{"text":"This place has such a great ambiance and has so much potential. I went with a party of 25 people to celebrate my birthday and myself including my friends and family were EXTREMELY disappointed with the customer service, and everyone's burnt food.  I had been looking forward to going to The Ivy for a while and read somewhat decent reviews on yelp so I decided it would be perfect for my birthday dinner with friends and family. I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and requested to be outside near the fire pits & heaters next to the live music. *I mentioned numerous times that it was important to me to have our party near the live music. I called the week before, and the day before, to confirm everything was scheduled correctly and they assured me that we would be sitting outside near the music, with fire pits etc. around to keep the party warm.   On the day of our reservation, about an hour before our reservation time, I get a phone call from the hostess who tells me \"unfortunately your party will not be outside on the patio because we now have a larger party that will be taking up the patio and we don't have any outdoor heaters\".  Upset, I requested to speak to the manager, Chris, because I had already made my reservation 2 weeks prior and was assured we would be on the patio next to the music with the heaters and fire pit. When I talked to Chris he was not very professional or understanding by any means. While I attempted to explain the situation and why I was upset, he quickly cut me off and began talking over me and said \"well I have my propane line that's been leaking so I can't just have that on obviously. So we will have you inside in the back at a large table for your party. The music plays throughout the restaurant too so you can just hear it over the speakers.\" Although Chris did seem a little rude in my opinion, I apologized for giving him attitude and told him I understood that the propane lines/heaters were out of his control and that I wasn't aware that happened so I could understand as far as the heaters go.   So, we get to the restaurant at our reservation time of 7..... the party they were speaking about is on the patio... with the fire pit ON, and all of the heaters ON surrounding their party. Then, we get to the table and you can't even hear the music at all!! At this point I was so frustrated because number one, they clearly were being dishonest and gave me some kind of BS reason we couldn't sit outside because \"there were no heaters\" for us.. but yet we show up and the other party on the patio is surrounded by all heaters  including the fire pit. And secondly, from the very beginning to now, we've talked more than once about how important it was to have the music and you tell me we will be able to hear it anyway, we get there and you can't hear the music at all!! I told the hostess I wanted to speak with the manager, Chris. Chris comes up and I tell him everything I just explained that I was upset about. And yet again, Mr. Chris is quick to cut me off and talk over me, and snaps back \"okay well I'll just turn up the speakers then.\" And walks away! Didn't address any of my other frustrations, didn't even apologize!! I was amazed at unprofessional and rude this \"manager\" was!! He literally could care less about my party and the business we were bringing them. He is a terrible example to his staff.   To top it off, the food was very subpar and extremely overlooked. Multiple people in my party all complained about this, and this too was not addressed by management and we received ZERO compensation for being moved to the back room, for our food being over cooked, or for the fact that my entire party was upset with the customer service and food including myself who made the reservation for my birthday celebration!!! Oh, and not even an apology. Not even once, from the entire staff including the manager!  I am so disappointed in this restaurant. I was really looking forward to going but the experience was so unpleasant and I will not be returning. If this place got a new management and replaced some of the staff with more attentive, friendly, and professional people this restaurant would become much more successful. The owner of this restaurant should be very concerned with who is currently in charge of managing the staff and running the restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall this restuarant is aweful.  They have one chance to impress me....and they failed.  The service is real bad, not going to take it out on the servers, but management needs to review this. We sat at a dinner on a Wednesday night for over 2 hours and Not by choice. After ordering drinks it takes your servers 10 minutes to come back to the table and tell you \"we are out of that paticular drink\". Let me just say there was only 4 people sitting at the bar...your bartender could have come out from behind to communicate.  Lastly there was no hostess when we walked in at 5:50 and no hostess when we left at 8:30. So why make a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Lovely interior and a great patio. I've been several times and the service is always great, but some of the food could use a little improvement. The chicken pita is pretty much tasteless, and the bruschetta is so-so. The gyros are great and the Ivy fries are amazing, so stick with those and you'l be fine."}
{"text":"We love Ivy! Beautiful atmosphere, the fabulous food and the amazing service. Anthony was great and the Flaming Cheese was the best!! Thx! We shall be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. Nice place to have a cocktail and dine. Fort time here and I love it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I looked forward to visiting this restaurant because we love Mediterranean food and the good comments online.  We came for lunch at noon and there were about 5 tables seated.  I observed only one waiter as more people started to come in. The food was good, not excellent.  The Ivy fries were different and good.  We were not impressed with the ambience; very industrial and furniture didn't seem coordinated.  I know who looks at that, we do.  We didn't feel the environment was warm and welcoming.  Today was cloudy and wet...maybe that contributed. Overall I had high expectations based on comments but I was somewhat let down.  We will come back for lunch on a warmer day but not willing to try dinner.  I hope service improves, one waiter at lunch is not enough."}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean food with a modern twist and sophisticated ambiance. Love their Mediterranean shrimp, pitas, loaded potatoes and hummus. Awesome patio with fire pits!"}
{"text":"We came here for my friend's birthday. Ivy has a very modern flair with a tasteful interior design. The ambiance was fun with a live band playing low-key melodies. Our server was very prompt and courteous and did a great job being his first day!   I ordered the Ivy kale salad with chicken which was quite delicious. I also tried some calamari and hummus which was right on point! My others friends all seemed to enjoy their dishes and drinks as well. My only disappointment was that they were out of the saganaki (flamed cheese cooked with ouzo). A few of us were very curious about this intriguing dish. Perhaps next time. After dinner we sat in the patio outside which was very quaint and enjoyable.   Great place for dinner and very accommodating for groups. Will definitely be back at some point! :)"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Business looks slow- tables are available.  Hope they last.  Nice people too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is the best,  bartender, awesome,  food, very very good.   A great place to relax with friends over drinks with or without dinner"}
{"text":"delicious food and great atmosphere. One of my new favorite places in Chandler. They serve their lunch menu all day which the way I recommend ordering. Even though they're labeled lunch dishes the portions are really good and great value considering all the flavor. The club sandwich is like a mini tour of Greece and the hamburger has such a great fresh mozzarella cheese."}
{"text":"We love The Ivy!  The patio is beautiful, the staff wonderful, the food delicious, and the happy hour specials are very good.  $5 for craft beers - also discounts on wine, cocktails, and some appetizers.  The staff is so friendly, and they've amassed quite a following of \"regulars\" due to their friendly, welcoming attitude.    Our dog loves the pet-friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Very average.  And our waiter was very aggravated and informed us that he was overworked.  He was tired and didn't want to be there. The food was just average and the patio was dirty."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Great service, the food was excellent as well. The sea bass was excellent. Also the lamb dish was out of this world. We liked the ambiance but the place pretty empty for a Saturday night. The only downside was the mixed drinks were horrible. Syrupy, could not taste any alcohol, and basically downgraded the experience that is the Ivy. Don't know why the Ivy doesn't get that great cocktails are part of the overall experience. So we won't be back. Too bad because that is an easy thing to fix."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed watching the Preakness Stakes today. It's refreshing to be surrounded by race enthusiasts and the service, beer and food (Kale Chicken salad were OUTSTANDING (for a crowd this sized.) I will definitely be watching the Belmont Stakes here. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. WOW!!!"}
{"text":"I came in tonight and had a amazing time. I live in Scottsdale and spend a lot of time in biltmore and Arcadia... my restaurant bar is pretty high. The lamb skewers were literally the best meat without a1 or bbq sauce I've ever had. One of the owners/management was there, they were very concerned to make sure we enjoyed our experience. They deserve my rating, check it out for itself!"}
{"text":"Danielle is an amazing server. Very helpful!!! Very fast service and great atmosphere. Live music, wine, food and friends. What can be better?"}
{"text":"Booked this location for a private dinner event. The room is nice, can hold 25-35 depending on seating and there are doors that make it totally private. Food was delicious! I can't give this restaurant more than 3 stars because the management staff were difficult to work with and not attentive to our needs at all. They also refused to add extra seating to the room for a few last minute RSVPs even though more than 1/2 of their main dining room was empty the entire night, very strange. They also only gave our party of 25 only 1 server. She was a doll and made our night, definitely helped ease the disappointment and the frustration with the management & the challenges with the space."}
{"text":"The worst service ever.  We sat at the bar for an hour, never got our entrees, and the entire staff was in complete chaos.  They could make so much more money if this place was run well"}
{"text":"Wonderful! The atmosphere is phenomenal - we all  enjoyed our experience, from the food to the drinks, the patio to the music - we will definitely be recommending this place to our friends!"}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars because the food was good & the chick who stepped up to be our server was nice. I am huge about customer service since that is the business I am in as well. Not serving but beauty  so I realize we are not in the exact same boat. Over all customer service should be held at the same standard. I made reservations for my birthday. I made sure I said for my birthday so it could be extra special. Well, we got seated (party of 4 adults) and waited about 10mins or so. No one got us water or introduced themselves as our waiter. My fiancé eventually went to go ask where our waiter was. We saw a handful of them standing around confused and not willing to take on another table. Sorry but you guys were close enough for us to hear! A chick stepped up & explained we just weren't assigned anyone is why this problem occurred but she would be more than willing to step in! She was very personable & attentive. However, it's very inexcusable to not be prepared for a reservation let alone a reservation for a special event! Our first time here was a let down!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Wish it were just a little more local, but worth the drive.  Great bar and the Mediterranean French fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch. Very nice space in a plaza we haven't been to before. Bruschetta was good. The meal was good enough as well- I had The Ivy club (I think is the name) which has gyro meat and chicken on it. Very large portion and the ivy fries were tasty, not overwhelming like specialty fries can be. Wife had lamb pita which she enjoyed. Big reason for the markdown is the wait time. It took FOREVER!  I had to go to the restroom and shave because it took so long. My wife was facing the dining room and commented that nobody had food on their table. It was an awkwardly long time. If this had been a first date, one of us definitely would have shared an awkward moment that would have stopped a second date. The server was apologetic but damn, that took a long time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, locally sourced food and drinks. Anthony gave us amazing service and honest and accurate recommendations based on our preferences. I can't really ask for more from a restaurant. And they are very reasonably priced for the quality.   I had the lamb gyro (I usually don't order lamb) and it was delicious.   AND...they have a kids menu. 'Nough said."}
{"text":"First time here with my family. We had the chilean sea bass, seafood paella and gyro pita with ivy fries. Everything was amazing. Highly recommend any of these dishes. Definitely will be coming back! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"The servers here always rub me the wrong way. I always have male servers here and they are plain out slow and creepy. One server was flirting and annoying. On a second visit a server brought me a drink that I didn't order. After telling him it was a mistake he still managed to put the drink on my bill.  The drinks are not good either. Very weak.  Absolutely nothing special about the food. Good luck finding a parking spot on any given weekend evening."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. We went on a Saturday during the day and it was pretty empty, so the service was pretty attentive.   The food is decent. I wasn't overly impressed with the chicken pita but the portion sizes are decent. We will probably give it another try based on other reviews."}
{"text":"I love this place when we were selling our house we came here with our dogs and they were so friendly love the food and the drinks are great too"}
{"text":"OMG, this place is amazing. Best service, wine, and happy hour food. I have not been able to find a comparable restaurant for happy hour anywhere in Chandler or Gilbert. Bartender Chris welcomed us and gave samples of wine and hummus to help us figure out what we wanted. Then waitress Jaime stepped in continued the amazing service. This is our new Saturday happy hour location."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday and they had a great live music. The place has a nice atmosphere, the most amazing fry's and a great Greek salad. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had a light lunch here today then came back later for the skewer entree knowing how delicious and tender the lamb, shrimp and chicken is when served on skewers. The crew today aka Chris, Brandon, Anthony, Nick and Chelsea are always so accommodating and friendly. This is a reg hangout for several reasons but for this purpose; great food and great service...both equally consistent!! Love The Ivy!"}
{"text":"The Ivy probably rates at an above-average restaurant with slightly above average prices.  My wife and I have been there three times (all during mid-afternoon Saturday trips), and on two of those three occasions they did have an artist playing guitar which was very nice and definitely helped to create a nice atmosphere.  And the food has been quite good, nothing all that grand but definitely tasty.  As I said, it's probably a bit more expensive than your average AZ spot, but it is very nice and we do keep going back, not out of convenience but because we've had good experiences there.  That has to count for something."}
{"text":"The food was great. We must've missed the dinner rush because our food came very quickly once the waitress offered her suggestions. My wife's cocktail was great as was my Moscow Mule. The waitress had forgotten about my drink and offered to rectify it by getting me a second on the house. I told her it was an honest mistake and declined but thanked her but great customer service. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great place and it has an OTB. They are very accommodating to large groups and the food is top notch."}
{"text":"Food was good. We ordered fries and a chicken salad never received the salad. Service was borderline bad. Staff doesn't know the menu. They were having an event outside maybe they weren't prepared."}
{"text":"I used to always come here on my lunch break just for the fries. IVY FRIES ARE TO DIE FOR! I've tried a few other things like the chicken pita, Spanakopita and this hot cheese they have (sorry I can't remember the name), and it's all good! The service is good, I had a waitress last time who didn't refill our water cups and someone else had to, not usually I have a guy who I think is a manager or something, and he is always great and fast! Also, not a huge thing, but I never get charged for Tzatziki for my fries, but I did last time. I'll pay for what I eat, I was just surprised. I like the layout with the comfy seats and lots of different options whether you like booth type, lounge chairs or high tops. The outside seating is cute too!"}
{"text":"A small group of us came in for lunch.  We sat outside on the patio, which was pretty large!  Our waitress, Lauren, was awesome!  We had great conversation throughout our meal and were very well taken care if.  Great selection of drinks and the food was excellent!  So fresh tasting and cooked perfectly.  I highly recommend this place!  Can't wait to take my family here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic first visit to The Ivy. Shrimp appetizer was a great start to our evening. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great variety on the menu and the food is delicious! My favorites are the ivy fries, homemade hummus and the bruschetta! Great selection of craft beers and unique wines! The patio area is super nice and dog friendly and there is plenty of space for large parties! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food. My friend and I popped in for a late lunch and we were not disappointed. The flaming saganaki was as good as I've had in authentic greek restaurants in Chicago! The mediterranean shrimp on a creamy tomato sauce...yum. The Acai green iced tea..divine. All that's left is coming back after work for wine! Now my only question is where is the crowd of people swooning over this place?"}
{"text":"Anthony gave us great service and the cocktail menu is great! Atmosphere is relaxing and spacious- private room and outdoor seating also available."}
{"text":"It was a cool little spot with a fun patio despite being in the oh so common strip mall you find in this area. We ordered a lot of stuff tapas style and loved all the dishes especially the paella, which was surprising for the desert. The menu cocktails were a little underwhelming but the bartender made some unique creations and were quite delicious."}
{"text":"This place has great potential--nice atmosphere and setting.   I love Gyros and ours had the potential to be wonderful---generous portion of meat, yummy sauce.  Sadly, it was served lukewarm so the pita wasn't soft and the meat tepid.   The place is really dark---if you plan on reading the menu, bring a flashlight or have a flashlight app on your phone. They are very proud of their wine---the cheapest glass is 9 dollars--and there is just one $9.00 option---and all the rest are $10.00 and up.  There's a kool-aid tasting house sangria option for $5.00.  Draft beer is $5.00 per glass--there are lots of choices. I'd like to try their gyros again in the hopes that they would be served hot."}
{"text":"The bartender Megan offerd excellent Service!  She made sure I always had a drink. Recommended the Greek Quesadilla which (with a bit of siracha for heat) was amazing! I noticed the GM Chris was working very hard for the 6 hours I was there. Always making sure the guest were taken care of."}
{"text":"One of the slowest dining experiences I've ever had. Food is mediocre at best. Don't know how this place has a high rating. If you got an hour and half to kill for a below average lunch this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Ugh. unfortunately, I'm downgrading my review from the four stars I gave it the first time we went there. This time, we ordered Chilean sea bass and a paella. The sea bass was ok, the fish was flaky, however,  the orange was completely overpowering in what was supposed to be an orange cilantro glaze. The paella was awful. When they brought it out for my husband I even asked what he ordered because the pathetic mixture that was on his plate didn't even look like a paella. It was a sad, colorless, salty, tasteless version of one. Cheap calamari were predominant, and the portion was pretty small,  and it wasn't the cheapest dish on the menu.  Three service was good overall even though the waiter plopped my dirty silverware on the table after I put it on the plate after the appetizer to be taken away. He only took the plate away, and I'm a little bit of a germophobe, especially when it comes to restaurant tables. I guess i should've asked for new silverware but I didn't, the silverware was left for me to be used again lol.    Unfortunately, we probably won't be back, the atrocious paella did it for us!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Ivy twice recently and am really impressed. Both times I've sat on the patio.. the ambiance is fantastic, service is great, and prices are reasonable. I recommend this for a nice casual spot with friends!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.  This was my second time at The Ivy. My first time was over a year ago for dinner, and it was totally fine. I thought the food was okay and the drinks and ambience were super cute. As a result, I suggested it for a girls brunch.  We met up for brunch today; there were about 10 of us and other than that, the place was dead. There was just an odd, empty vibe to the place, cute decor was still there, but it looked kind of dirty/disheveled.   They were out of tons of stuff, drinks were slow to be refilled, empty plates left on the table for a long time, etc. it was just odd-- like you could see leftover Christmas paper on your way back to the bathroom, the bathrooms weren't particularly clean,  my friend got a salad without dressing and it ended up being because they were out of salad dressing, but no preemptive attempt was made to correct it before she complained. Whenever we attempted to voice a minor concern, the waiter indicated that it was all due to poor management?  Sometimes service is slow with a big group, but this went beyond that. It was very, very odd.  I want to love this place, it's cute and the food was good, but this trip left A LOT to be desired, sadly."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mediterranean food in Chandler. Service and ambiance are great. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"My experience on Monday was the first time I had been there. I met a girlfriend for lunch  who had only good things to say about it. I could see why. The ambiance is pretty cool. It's spacious and open with a lot of seating inside and out. My only complaint is that I ordered the fish tacos because the waiter recommended them but I felt they were lacking in substance. The fish was small  chopped pieces of whitefish with cilantro, onions and tomatoes. They tasted good but were not the best tacos I've had. My friend had some kind of a chicken kale salad that she absolutely loved. I'll return to try something else."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  The place was pretty empty.  Waitress was very nice and attentive.  The food was expensive and blah over all. I  had a salad with chicken and walnuts and thats pretty much all there was too it.  They needed to add a lot more veggies to make it worth the 12 they charged for it."}
{"text":"We come here often.   Food is always good.   Unfortunately,  service is not the best and food is slow to come t o the table.   This latest visit it was very noisy and it was the servers laughing historically.   Hope that doesn't happen next time."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere, and the food is on point! The only negative thing about the place is the rude bartender. I placed a takeout order and picked it up at the bar. The female bartender never smiled or said hi to me. She coldly took my money and gave me my change without even looking at me. She wasn't welcoming or pleasant. She needs to be in the back in the kitchen, so she doesn't have to help people."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the food was great! The salad was fresh and dressing was good. The fries were not at all greasy. And our pitas were filled with delicious meat. The drinks we got were very well mixed too. Nice outdoor patio with friendly service."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Food had a lot of flavor. We got the saganaki for an app and they set it on fire right at our table.   For dinner we shared the gyro pita and added the ivy fries. Dang those fries were good. Not to much lemon or garlic. The gyro was good and there is actual rotating lamb in the back. The pita was soft and the gyro had the right amount of stuff in it.   They got a little busy and the staff was hustling to make sure each tables needs were met. The food came out in a very timely manner and was really good. All in all I'd say we will come back to try more."}
{"text":"First the positives, the drinks were great, we had white sangria and the Mykonos Mule.  Both were very good and refreshing.  We also enjoyed the Ivy fries with lemon and feta, very tasty and arrived hot!! The reason for 2 stars is we ordered the flank steak and shrimp skewers dinners.  They arrived barely lukewarm and the rice with the shrimp dinner was not cooked, it was crunchy and awful.  We told the waitress and she asked the chefs what happened. No solution or offer to warm up.  Finally my sister asked to speak to the manager who was very apologetic and said if he had known he would of taken care of it.  We appreciated this and he covered our meals and gave us a gift certificate to try again.  Because of the good customer service, we will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"This place had great flavor service was decent but 2 of our dishes came out cold ....... order the saganaki it was by far the best thing we got"}
{"text":"We had the unfortunate experience of checking out The Ivy today. It's in the same Plaza as Oregano's Pizza and Nandos both of which were packed so we went to The Ivy for drinks and to share a meal. Craft beer selection was good as was service. The entree was very disappointing. We had the Chicken Pesto Pasta which was more like a pea green soup with cold Tyson chicken strips on top. Pasta was fine.  Very disappointing overall. ..server took one dollar off meal when we commented on the dish.  There are so many great options out there. ...would not come here again."}
{"text":"Its one of the best foods I have had in recent times. Loved the ambiance. The food was great especially the bruschettas and loved the hummus and pita. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other day and loved the food!  When the bill came, she said the pitas were free (I guess they do that every so often)...So, great food and great staff!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I will say that the portion size for the price is reasonable. I had to take a fair bit of my dinner home. The atmosphere is low pressure, easy to converse with your party. Music is playing, but at a level that adds ambience. Servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"First time trying this place! We ordered the Mezedes which was the dinner for four. This allowed us to try a little of everything! It was surprisingly delightful! The salad was so good and came with hummus and plenty of warm pita bread. Variety of skewers on a platter of rice including shrimp, chicken, lamb and lamb chops. All of the meats were perfectly cooked and so tender! Would definitely order the lamb chops there again. We also ordered the crab cakes which were nice and plump full of crab. Flamed cheese was good but not enough or interesting enough to order again. Great inside/ outside open patio bar. Can't wait to go back and order the paella!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Just got lunch here and my chicken skewers came out raw. The outside was seared and the insides were completely raw. They brought it out a second time and there was a hair in the side salad. Another girl in our party had a hair in her entree and there were flies in the dining room. Staff was also noticeably rude"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant IF you like to be served by a girl with a hole the size of a football in her jeans, with the personality of a rock, and if you like to be left alone without someone checking on you to see if you would like something, or just to ask how the food is.  You will also need to enjoy a $34 Sea Bass smaller than a McDonald's Fish Sandwich.  It had a little too much batter for me, but other than that, tasted well. My wife loved her Shrimp Spaghetti, hence the two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor seating and our service was good. For me, most of the food was either dry or lacked flavor. The exception was the spanakopita, which was perfection."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the food is good don't great but good, healthy options. You do have to be prepared for the worst service I've had in any restaurant EVER. We ask to be sat after waiting and get a teenager rolling her eyes. When we ask the waitress about food or wine we get everything is good and I don't drink. When we asked to sample a wine we over heard her say to another waitress can you believe these people. I asked if we can move tables to the outside bar but open a window to listen to the musician since she thinks we are being difficult. She said sorry we don't open that and not two minutes later for her \"regulars\" she sits them where we requested and opened the window. I asked to speak with a manager and said they didn't have one on duty again. It was overall a very disappointing experience will NEVER return and would not recommend if you want a positive experience.  Sincerely disappointed"}
{"text":"I tried to go here last night at 9:52pm and was told it was closed.  I had specifically checked the hours on the website(suppose to close at midnight on Friday and Saturday) before going and was very upset to find that they were not open.  They need to update their website to reflect their current schedule.  Ended up at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers instead.  Wasn't really what I was looking for but at least they were open the hours they advertise to be open."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. Excellent drinks, fresh food, local suppliers, friendly staff, and the have a kids menu!  The atmosphere is hip and elegant.  So perfect for Sunday brunch.  We will for sure be back.  Pro tip: try the Ibiza and the Ivy fries.  Anthony or server is the BEST!  He made us feel right at home and gave us great recommendations on the menu."}
{"text":"Grabbed a little late lunch on a Monday and took a chance on this place. Odd seating but eclectic. Very casual employees. The young female employee at the bar had her belly hanging out of her shirt. Young male server's jeans were sagging and he looked high. Friendly though. Food was so delicious! Ivy fries perfect and the gyro large and meaty. Expensive but giant portions so kind of worth it. We will be back but hoping the young employees dress a bit more professional for the prices"}
{"text":"From the lack of interest when we walked in the door to our impersonal waitress, our first visit to The Ivy started badly.  We ordered wine and two appetizers to start; hummus platter and calamari.  Both were pleasant enough....we should have stopped there.  When I ordered the Flank Steak I was not asked how I liked it done.  When I reminded the waitress she simply said \"Oh, it just comes one way....medium.\"  Very unusual.  It was served with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  When the plate arrived there was a large amount of bland meat, maybe 4 tiny slices of potato, and I had a difficult time finding the spinach.  It sat in a pool of extremely sweet balsamic vinegar reduction.  The vinegar competed with everything on the plate.  Yuk. One friend had lamb with pita (average at best.  He'd asked for no lettuce - it came stuffed with lettuce) and my other friend had the lamb skewer dinner.  The lamb was cooked nicely, but the potatoes were inedible.  They had been cubed and soaked in straight lemon juice and then tossed in some kind of herb sauce.....a promising combination but SO sour they could not be eaten. Like Howard, I too wanted this to be our favorite restaurant.  My friends lived in Greece for 28 years.  Since they arrived 3 years ago we have been on the hunt for good (or even decent) Greek food in a fun atmosphere.  Sadly, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Best greek food I've ever had! We got bruschetta, flaming cheese, gyro pita, and the ivy club with ivy fries. Everything tasted absolutely amazing! I will be returning! New fave spot!"}
{"text":"Super romantic and intimate. The staff is friendly, food is delicious, and the wine of the moment is tasty. Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the gyro salad.  We used to live near this place and went often.  Not sure why they can't attract a consistent crowd.  Service can be slow at times but still worth a visit as food was always good."}
{"text":"Tried this new place by accident tonight. We were very impressed. The service was excellent. We had the chicken skewer dinner and the lamb skewers dinner. Both were very good. The lamb especially was tender and cooked perfectly.  The only negative was the noise level with the bar so centralized in the room. We will definitely return for some of the tastiest Mediterranean food in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place! The food has always been good and we are regular drinkers of their white sangria :) We have been a  little bit disappointed about the ambience since they brought in the horse racing ... totally changes the vibe when that's going on. However, if that what was needed to keep this business going -- I can get behind that ... for now at least! Ivy Fries + Grilled chicken skewers + White Sangria = One great meal."}
{"text":"Anthony our server was great!! The patio was so beautiful! Really nice ambiance here. Drinks are obviously expensive but the food is good. Looking forward to trying something new next time!"}
{"text":"First time at The Ivy this evening for dinner. I had the Portobello Giro with Greek Salad. It was delicious! The ambiance was relaxing, a nice candle lit dinner with my significant other. The waitress was very attentive.  I should have tired the baklava! Next time."}
{"text":"The Ivy food and service is absolutely unbelievable. Great atmosphere, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, wonderful live entertainment, great service, delicious food. Lamb tacos were to die for.  Steak was good, the creamy sauce of Shrimp santorini was savory, Mmmm so good."}
{"text":"The food was not horrible, the sangria was really good r server was good, but the happy hour food size is a joke it's like a sample food for kids super tiny bite sizes not even worth the price even for happy hour, we asked for extra pita bread and got charged $3.00!! Seriously!! Good but I think overpriced. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  We stopped here because it was on the way to where we were going, and the menu seemed good.  The light Greek style was very flavorful and enjoyable.  Don't recommend for most middle class families.  The prices are quite expensive, and the portions in return are just ok."}
{"text":"In town on business - second attempt at going here, first time they were closed for reasons unknown... Walked in around 7:00 on a Monday night - only eleven people here: 5 were together, 4 were taking up the eight seats at the bar and didn't appear to be the type of people I'd enjoy sharing elbow space with, and the other 2 were a couple of locals who walked in just after I did and were taken care of before I was even greeted. My next best option for a seat was at the stand-up table, where the busser came out and greeted me with a menu. The bartender came by a few minutes later and got my drink order, then took my order. On recommendation from the bartender, I had the Ivy Club Sandwich which was quite good, albeit a bit sloppy. Great flavor and filling. Decent beer selection, but the trance music and 'dining hall' feel left something to be desired. Oh, and the fact that the supervisor was at the host desk was audibly enjoying watching videos on his phone and that a lady at the bar was allowed to vape, was, to say the least, off-putting,.."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a whim, our server Brandon was very prompt and helpful. We had a gyro pita and salad, portions were generous and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but really nice patio. Maybe worth a try when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"I love the Ivy! It is quite trendy and I have to say the first time in there I felt a little out of place; but was not treated that way at all.  The service there is magnificent and the food even better! I love their Gyro Pita, it's the reason I go.  The hummus is also delicious. My family has eaten the salads, chicken kabobs and lamb kabobs which were all great as well.   The wine is pricey, but the selection is all high end wines.  Same goes for the mixed drinks - pricey but SO good. Their Moscow Mule is the best I have had. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, we came because they had free brunch. You can't really complain much when you're getting something for free, right? It was super packed from all the people coming to get free stuff, but even when the rush died down, our server forgot about us multiple times. She remedied it by giving us a $1 off happy hour card, but we waited 30 minutes just to get waters. We made eye contact with out server several times, but it seemed like she was ignoring us and running around trying to serve other tables. Eventually we asked someone else if we could order. The brunch was free and not that tasty. I had cold toast, cold eggs, and over cooked bacon. And again, it's hard to complain about that because it was free, but I would probably avoid the whole free brunch angle for them because it's not good service or food.   So we went to happy hour later on, and our server was great. She recommended our drinks that were no longer on the menu and dealt with our drunken BS. The fries and bruschetta was super delicious, but the shrimp is kind of..off tasting ...? Not sure how to describe it, but it tasted not fresh.   All in all, don't go to the free brunch because the servers will ignore you and say they'll come back soon but won't. But go in for happy hour with your group."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and very friendly service, so we were really optimistic at first. Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. I enjoyed the Ivy Fries, but the lamb in the gyro I ordered was tough and gamey. The flatbread was cheap store bought and fell apart easily, and the tzatziki sauce was disappointing. The Greek salad was underwhelming. Overall, the food just wasn't quite worth the price, and I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Close to my work for a healthy lunch.  Patio is dog friendly & a great option (weather permitting).  Great beer selection, too!"}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars. Great ambiance on a Saturday evening. There was a Guitar player singer on the patio. I would go back to listen to him, he had a John Mayer thing going on that I enjoyed.   Our server, whose name I don't recall was quite pleasant. Service though was incredibly slow. So slow, we debated leaving and the restaurant was not full. We were seated immediately and there were open tables, so I don't know why timing was so off. Our appetizer came shortly before our food, sigh. We got a hummus trio - the jalapeño was very hot and had to be tempered with the Mediterranean. Other than that the flavors were good. They serve them in bowls that are not functional (picture a deep, wide ramekin) - impossible to get the hummus out of with their thick silverware. It should be served on a plate so you can easily eat it with their pita. Which, by the the way, their pita were delicious. Really. Good. Pita.  We split a grilled chicken pita and it was ok. Not terrible, not amazing.   Didn't try dessert. I think another reviewer mentioned this - it feels like some of,their menu selections are all over the map, but not in a way that breeds confidence.   We liked the live music, the interior is nice, silverware was odd, hummus had ups and downs - if I order again I'm asking them to hold their silly bowls. We want to give it another shot and try a couple more dishes before we rule it in or out."}
{"text":"Not bad but rather average. I had the lamb skewers and they were on the dry side. I enjoyed the ambiance but next time I will try something different."}
{"text":"2.5 stars because of good waiter Went with some friends and service Wyoming was poor. 15 minutes to get a drink water. Food was OK. Spanakopita was cold.   Bruschetta was very good but,we won't come back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like The Ivy. I really did. It's close to my house. It's a spot with a nice bar and great ambience, even when it was Chao. Plus, it's on my discount card.  And I love Mediterranean food. I stick to the basics, and they're hard to screw up, but The Ivy managed that feat. They blasted our entrees, overcooking the chicken and shrimp kebabs to toughness. They also left some sinew on the chewy chicken.  On the plus side, the rice was excellent and the soft, seasoned pitas were even better. The hummus was about average and the salad was decent, although the dressing was a little sweet for my taste. At least there was good live music. Otherwise, the night might have been a big fat Greek disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent!  It has all the components for a great experience. Great food, nice decor, and great service.  Virginia was attentive, had some great suggestions on food and drinks and was very friendly.  Definitely will be revisiting."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try the Ivy for Valentine's Day and had never been before. Upon arrival, the staff was friendly and accommodating.  We were sat immediately and our waitress was kind. Although the Valentine's Day menu was not explained to us thoroughly, we were excited to see what they had to offer. The deal is a 4 course meal for $50. First was the appetizer-- the shrimp eggplant was extremely cold and disappointing. Main courses were equally disappointing. Salmon was incredibly dry and steak (medium rare) was just rare and tasteless. Thank god the sides were filling. Desert was again, mediocre. I do not recommend this restaurant and am extremely disappointed in our experience."}
{"text":"Live music? Umm, I guess. But that's only if you like pretty poor covers of Clapton, Cash, and even Nirvana played very loud.   Service- Good enough  Food- $16 dollar hummus appetizer? Really? Ok but you should probably skip it.   Chicken skewers- Portion too big but it doesn't really matter because even if you hadn't eaten in a week you wouldn't finish it. Dry as the Mojave desert.   Lamb skewers- I'm sorry a sweet little lamb had to die for this. Out of about 12 or so cubes of meat only one you could actually chew. The rest were like trying to eat a leather football. I left the remnants of half chewed dead lamb chunks on my plate. Hopefully the dishwasher tells the half ass cook that sh*t is fuked up and nobody can actually eat it.   Will I return? Hell no, I'd rather drink my own pee."}
{"text":"This was our first time at The Ivy. We arrived at 545 on Saturday. Light crowd and comfortable seating on the patio. My wife had pear salad and I the pita. The bruschetta with sweet peppers was awesome. Our server was Janie and she did an outstanding job. Service timing was spot on."}
{"text":"First time here the food was incredible delectable even perfect service from Virginia, Brandon and Anthony. I had spaghetti carbonara,lamb pita and lamb skewers. I highly recommend. I would leave a pic but I already killed it ."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Service was great! Had a Blap Blap Blood Orange beer at that was fantastic! Very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good - especially their shrimp with eggplant dish.  Gyro pita was ok - gyro was a bit dry.  Happy Hour is worth it! Even the Chardonnay was decent"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch our server's name was Anthony the place looked very nice and it's in a great location, we were seated offered some water & I also ordered a beer. To begin with the beer was a bit warm.. the salmon was overcooked it was very bland. I also asked for a side of rice which  had no taste. To me it tasted like it came from a box one of those instant packages..  The food is nothing like authentic Mediterranean food over all it was overpriced service was OK... and food was maybe a 2... I probably won't be coming back again. I don't reccomend The Ivy to anyone for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Thanks Groupon For Finding This Place For Us!  We have to give a shout out to Groupon for getting us a rocking deal to make the journey over to this hidden gem of a place we would have never otherwise found on our own!   This place earned it's 5 star rating by having THE BEST BRUSCHETTA IN ARIZONA! I am not kidding either, I love food and this place did an excellent job...   Salmon Ravioli Alfredo was OUTSTANDING! This is seriously the thing to order here.   The Bruschetta as mentioned earlier is AWESOME!   It may be a bit out of the way if you don't frequent this area but it is worth the drive from Scottsdale to eat here.   The atmosphere was very inviting and cozy, the bar was clean and organized, bathrooms clean too!   We came on a slow weekday with few customers so it was nice inside.   The service was friendly but when you want to order more food and get more drinks it required waving across the room to get attention..."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch (which happened to be free) for customer appreciation day.  I ordered the chicken pita which was great.   The Ivy is a very cute place and I look forward to checking out their happy hour drinks and specials."}
{"text":"My wife and I have found a new favorite thing to do....trying new dining venues. She got to choose the place tonight.   We weren't expecting live music but was very pleased with the performance. I wish I had caught the guys name. If anyone reads this please let me know when we can see him play again. His choice of music was great. Seemed to know his nitch very well.  On to the food. For an appetizer we had the Hummus Trio. Traditional, Red Pepper & Jalapeño. I especially wanted to try the jalapeño. The flavor was subtle at first but after tasting the other two the jalapeño flavor was noticable. The texture was not quite but almost creamy. Enjoyable would order again.  Entrées, she ordered the lamb gyro with seasoned fries and I got the shrimp skewers. Unfortunately the shrimp was way over cooked. Chewy and rubbery and a disappointment. The side of mediterranean seasoned rice was more enjoyable.  I would probably not order again. Fortunately the gyro and frys were much better. The lamb was tender and flavorful I wanted more. The seasoned fries were delicious. I Would recommend.  I was excited to see baklava on the desert menu. Unfortunately that turned out to be another disappointment and probably the worst example of the dish I've had anywhere. Baklava is supposed to be flakey and sweet with walnuts or pistachios. This one used walnuts. The crust wasn't flakey it was like cardboard. It looked like Baklava, but it didn't really taste like it. I would NOT recommend it. I would hate for someone that has never had this desert before to have the one I was given. They might never try it again and miss out on a wonderful experience.  We enjoyed the atmosphere of the establishment and will most likely go back. My wife's experience was better than mine. As far the food, hopefully my next choices will be better.  P.S. Our service was good. I'm hoping after next visit I can bump the review up."}
{"text":"Average fare at above average prices, pretentious decor and service is just meh...  Cypress grill is now closed so yet another mediocre  restaurant on the corner of Dobson and Germann that can survive due to location and lack of nearby alternatives."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food was average.  The order wasn't delivered correctly so when I asked for something that should have come out with my hummus I was charged more."}
{"text":"Brandon thanks for the great bar service. Good food too. Had an enjoyable lunch. Nice environment and great staff. Very friendly and welcoming.  Can't wait to come back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"Definitely disappointing. Cool ambiance, food pretty good, but came here at about 1:15 on a Saturday and waited over an hour and 20 min for a couple of gyros. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went there for mother's day with my brood. ..6 adults and 3 children.   Although they were short staffed,  our waiter was attentive to our every need.   We all had the salads which are large servings and were great.    As appetizers,  we had the Greek fries and humus. . All was great.  Hubby and I went back two nights later and say on the patio. .. it was quiet, nice despite Germann being right on the other side of the wall.   We had the Greek shrimp and the pesto chicken.   They were okay. . Love the ambiance of this place.  Love the bar.   Love the location.   It is a our local favorite."}
{"text":"Awful, the only reason it's getting 2 stars is because it was clean.  11 of us went for lunch . Everyone who ordered a Gyro received a cold sandwich and cold fries. Sent them back and they were still cold when we got them back.  Food was not good except a salad that one of our members ordered. She said it was very tasty.  Asked the waitress for something and she snapped that she only had 2 hands. Really? They will not see any of us again."}
{"text":"We came in with a couple of friends for lunch today. Fantastic service from the moment that we walked in until we left. Brandon provided truly amazing customer service and was knowledgeable about everything on the menu. He gave us great recommendations and the food was fantastic! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Meh.  We tried it for dinner and found it really plain.  The service was slow.  Took 40 minutes for our appitizer and then the meal took another 20.  The shrimp was ok, the rice tasted of olive oil, potatoes like vinegar.  We love the look of the place and wanted to like it, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Danielle was rude and grumpy tonight. Not sure we will return because of this poor service."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service the 3 different times we came here. I think we will go somewhere else next time. Food is mediocre, prices high and the bad service. Sad, cause the restaurant is no cell and beautiful patio"}
{"text":"Awesome food and Megan is the best bartender!! Great food and impeccable service. Chris and Brandon are awesome as well. Great place to hang with friends. Awesome live music as well."}
{"text":"Me and my friend tried the Kale Salad and Shrimp Santorini. The salad is very very plain, nothing special. And the pasta was just too oily. There was about 2 Tbsp oil on the bottom of my plate after I finish my plate. I really wanted to enjoy my lunch because I was hungry, but I just couldn't..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and great staff!  Apparently some people #watchme, have a problem with leaves on trees.  Oh, well.  Can't fix stupid.  Christina is a great manager! Oh, and if you can't fit in the bathroom, maybe you should stay home."}
{"text":"If your looking for solely ambiance this place is a good place to unwind. The food is definitely mediocre. I've had way better Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Really great food! Loved our server! Super friendly, and made the experience even better. Have awesome happy hours, which are from 3pm-6pm and then from 9pm-close. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Our meal was excellent!  The butternut ravioli was my favorite!  The lamb gyro and burgers were excellent too.  Our service was really good.  The prices are very good for the amount of food we got!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful and the gyro pita is fantastic. Prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. Well worth a visit. I will be back for the portobello pita for sure."}
{"text":"Fabulous....as always!  Great staff, great food, great ambiance, great happy hour.  What more could you ask for.  The Ivy will continue to be one of our \"go to\" neighborhood spots."}
{"text":"Very poor lighting, so we elected to sit close to the entry door. Friendly staff however poor service. Food was bland and cold. Sent to 2 Gyro Pita Meals back to the kitchen. Took an excessive amount of time to get anything to eat. After spending $112 plus tip, we have no intentions of returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The kabobs are really good. The pesto sauce with the calamari was amazing. The hummus is yummy. If we were wanting to eat at the bar, I think it would have been great nights all around. But both times we were in the dining room and service was very hit and miss. At first they're super with it, and then they're forgetting things or not coming by at all. One server walked by my empty plate 5 times before my hubby finally spoke up and asked for the check. If ever I'm meeting friends for happy hour, this place will still top my list."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Was this place an unexpected little gem! I had a quick work lunch here and was so pleasantly surprised! Beautiful restaurant inside and great medditeranean food to match! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the money!  My wife loves the chicken pita and the freaking ivy fries are un-F-in believable.  They accept the passport card which is awesome because it's buy one get one.  A little pricey but hey quality always is.  The Decor is very inviting and I guess I'll say cool.  Couldn't think of a better adjective.  I highly recommend and hope they thrive and do well.  It's great to have non chains around our community."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Ivy. We sat outside on a very comfortable patio chairs. We ordered the mussels in wine sauce and the fries and fell in love with both. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. The cocktail menu looked delicious however I opted for a nice glass of wine. We liked the casual atmosphere. Unfortunately we were hoping for a more of a  Mediterranean ambiance to complement the menu as well but overall a good local restaurant."}
{"text":"Lunched with a friend on the patio. Nice location and lots of outdoor seating. Service was quick and our waitress courteous. Both friend and I had gyros, his chicken and mine regular. The Greek salad was fresh and tasty. Best part of the meal was the Ivy fries. So crispy and delicious. Don't think I can ever return though. My gyro meat was obviously straight out of the refrigerator (or freezer?) Still had a chill on it and tasteless with an unusual texture. Could only eat a couple bites and I love Greek normally. Bill was $31 for two gyros with two sodas and tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! From the food which is great to the decor it is so wonderful!I live the kale salad and their lamb is superb! Drink list is fun and original! Love it!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Ivy since they open.  It's close to our home and the food is amazing.  The Ivy fries are a must and we have never been disappointed with any recommendation the servers have made.  The reason for writing this reviews is because of the service, it has been on point every time we go. If you are in the neighborhood check it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service.  Small selection of beer but still a good choice of craft brew. The jalapeño hunmus was delicious.  I loved the whole greek theme and decor. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We went there to see a Brazilian band play and I invited several friends to come along. The music was great. The service was horrible. Long delays to get the food served, huge lines for the drinks, bartenders who had no idea what they were doing. Margarita's , Caipirinhas and Mojitos were all the same drink. Sad,"}
{"text":"First time at the ivy and I loved it!! Food is great and the ambiance is out of this world. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday.  We had a reservation and were seated right away.  Service was good.  Food was very good, we ordered three different items and everyone liked them.  We had the bruschetta as an appetizer which was very good, especially the bread, but smaller than expected.  I also had the lamb skewers and they were very good, lamb was cooked very well.   We ordered all dinner items, but there lunch menu looked very good. Food seemed a little pricey for what it was, but not terrible.  Lunch items were also priced more like I would expect .   We all liked the vibe and atmosphere, not as loud as I expected although we were gone by 8 or 8:30.  A lot of the tables are more like couch areas and might not be great for actual dining but would work well for drinks.  We were at a real table inside.  Bathrooms here are kind of weird, not really a big deal but worth mentioning.   Has a shared sink area, which is pretty common now, but the actual bathrooms are essentially closets with toilets.  Feels a bit like a port-a-potty."}
{"text":"Yet another nice night at The Ivy!! My lamb skewers with a Greek salad and garlic red potatoes were delicious. We had drinks with an order hummus and shrimp with eggplant for an appetizer."}
{"text":"Tasty Greek food at a really reasonable price. Ambiance was unique and fun. Loved that it was not part of a chain. Live music on Sunday's was unique and the patio looks great for the winter. Parking was sufficient or free valet. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"All my stars is for the ambience and starters. It's a beautiful place for a nice lunch or a dinner. So relaxing and perfect with trees around.   Food is on average side, we ordered calamari, the worst I have had. It was bland and tasteless. However the shrimp was right on specially the sauce. Hummus trio, never have complaints on that. Fish tacos was really good except for some smell. Lamb chops and grilled lamb were below average. The dessert specially the baklava was perfect.  The price is relatively on a higher side, not for a regular goer"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to try out the food for our potential rehearsal dinner- we tried a large assortment of food and I brought a large group with me with differing tastes. Everyone loved the food - there was not one item that we did not enjoy. The bruschetta and spanakopita was delicious. We really enjoyed the pear salad and the lime cilantro salad. Everyone raved about the lamb and shrimp skewers. We tried all 3 pastas- all were delicious - but the spaghetti carbonara was a hit. The wait staff was great and the restaurant was beautiful. We have decided to go through this restaurant for our rehearsal dinner. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since we love to support local businesses and was sadly disappointed.  Unfortunately after being seated they must have forgotten about us as no one came back to even take a drink order. They were too involved on their phones and talking to each other standing around doing nothing really. We got up and as we were leaving they asked why we where we were going...We said, \"to go eat\". They were very childish in response."}
{"text":"The best place to sit and wind down after a long day. They have an amazing diverse selection of all craft beer on tap and wines from all over the world! The staff is always upbeat and looks happy to work here. I always recommend this place to hang out with my friends. The GM Chris knows his stuff when it comes to wine knowledge and is super personable and makes you want to come back! Even though its a mediterranean lounge, don't let that deter you from the amazing food!! They have a wide variety that includes burgers, fish tacos, pitas, chicken skewers, etc. Overall I recommend this place to anyone who wants an amazing dining experience or if you just want to sit down and have a drink."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. EXCELLENT excellent service! We had a table of 10 for a birthday dinner and our drinks came fast, appetizers were spot on, food was phenomenal. We did sit outside and the heaters didn't really give off much heat so if you get cold easily, you might be better off inside.   I had the shrimp pasta and it was delicious. They do NOT skimp on the shrimp and it was honestly mouthwatering. Their martinis are also very good. I wish I remembered our servers name because she deserves the credit. She kept us in the know on the timing of everything and was just super easy going and friendly. Most servers get flustered or overwhelmed with a bigger table but it was like a mini party for her :) We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambience! We ventured out from Gilbert and weren't disappointed! Patio and music are cozy and relaxing. Mussles and lamb are very yummy. The service is excellent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I always love Gyro salad, my husband got wraps, very good! Lamb is really good! Servers are friendly!"}
{"text":"5 met for lunch and birthday get together.  All food was great and presentation impressive. Nice atmosphere. Waiter attentive. Will recommend."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today - brought in by a discount coupon and a desire to have a healthy meal.  We had the club sandwich and the greek salad with shrimp.  Both were very yummy and presentation was good.  Service was excellent and their patio is dog friendly.  Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"What happened? A busy Saturday night and the night crew left without cleaning Nasty bathrooms? Omg!  We've eaten here 4-5 times and were fairly impressed. Today all was gone. Lack of service, waitress brought water with our meal, she never even ask if we wanted a drink when she took order. slow, it took 30 minutes to get 2 gyros, one chicken, one gyro. Both were flavorless and lacked. French fries were the best thing on plate. Waitress never came back once to check on us, thus do we tip?  Never stepped out and even said is everything ok? Husband looked her up for our ticket. There were 3 tables with patrons in the whole house.  It must have been a rowdy Saturday, the place looked like that, staff was dragging and cook lost recipes! What happened?"}
{"text":"The Ivy is my favorite restaurant in town. The crew is great, the menu is excellent and healthy. Lots of space, sofas, etc... I had the butternut ravioli: yumi (delicious mushroom sauce and bread) !"}
{"text":"I gave it a 2 because the food was not good. And we got covered with tiny tree leaves, our food, drinks and all over us. Something i don't want on my food. 3 stars for service. The brushetta was terrible, specially the prosciutto. I could make it way better at home. My friends ordered calamari and i tried them....each have different taste. One of them have no seasonings. We told the waitress and all she said was \" they just didn't put much\" i said, they didn't put any at all. We could taste and see the difference between all the other calamaris that was ordered, it shouldn't look plainly white...anyways, not coming back. Then my waitress poured water on my sprite instead of a refill of sprite? Then i have to kept asking for refill. Well, thats what i have to say about this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went their for a much needed date night and it was wonderful! We're so happy to have such an awesome restaurant with great ambiance! I had the lamb chops and they were superb! My hubby had the Chilean Sea Bass and he loved it! Great place to take out of town guests, instead of taking them to some chain restaurant! The service was impeccable and they have live music!! Oh yeah, the appetizers were great too!!"}
{"text":"Best in south Chandler for Greek food.  Its tucked into the back of the shopping center so not many seem to know about it and it seems to always be half or less full.  Hopefully more will discover.  Service has been inconsistent at times."}
{"text":"Dish: Lamb Pita $9.95 Price and Quality: The pita had big chuck of meats and I loved it. The meat was soft. $9.95 pita is pretty reasonable. Other entrées are pretty pricy. I would like to revisit them when they have a lunch special :D   Comparison with other restaurant: Pita Jungle Vs. The Ivy I would like to go back to The Ivy. I was not happy with Pita Jungle food taste when I went in 2015 in Tempe location.   Revisit? YES"}
{"text":"Man what a cool place.  Really enjoy the casual, yet classy atmosphere and the staff, management and bartenders are so friendly and fun .  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best thing about lunch was the iced tea and the service.  Had the gyro and it was ok, meat was a bit dry and luke warm."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. Lots of writing in their options. All the Bruschetta is really good to. There's coconut cream in the salmon ravioli too! But it's quite eclectic with lots of artwork for sale. The shrimp and eggplant appetizer is very rich but also very tasty."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great! Great patio! Food, not so much. Food is so-so. Nothing to write home about. I actually don't think its worth coming back for."}
{"text":"We had a group, so tried a few of the appetizers: brushetta (manchego, prosciuttio, honey and feta, black olive, balsamic - great combinations),  hummus, shrimp & eggplant w/spicy marinara, and ivy fries. Everything but the ivy fries was delicious.  The ivy fries were interesting at first but really, they're just fries!  We then enjoyed lamb skewers, Shrimp Santorinia pasta, a gyro pita and the Chicken and Lime Cilantro salad. Again everything was delicious.  The only issue I had with this place was the flies.  The doors were open on a lovely day but there were WAY too many flies inside.  Annoying to gross."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed it for the most part.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the food prices are reasonable as well.  The pitas are good with the Ivy Club being my favorite.  It's basically a gyro and chicken sandwich with pitas as the bread.  The eggplant and shrimp app is great too. Some on here like the ivy fries but I found them very greasy.  The potatoes that came with the lamb skewers were just awful.  They were basically raw and when we told the server, he said \"some people like them like that.\"    No.  No they don't.  There are ample wine selections and a few quality beers on tap.    Live music has been going on both times I've been there which has been ok."}
{"text":"i have been there many times before and loved it, but this time we had the worst server ever!  we were sitting outside and could not see the specials board, so we asked her about it.  she said they used to have those, but she didn't know what they were.  we asked how they were prepared, and she said however you like!  we meant more descriptive, like what is in it and what comes with it,  she then said she thought that special board was for decoration.  we asked her to check,  she came back with no more information than before.  we asked her to check again and find out what is in each dish.  this time she had some answers.  servers need to know what the specials are when they come in for their shift.  I am also in the restaurant industry.  The food also did not seem to be up to par.  a little disappointed as we had out of town guests with us.  The server also dropped a knife on me when she picked up the dirty dishes.  Not as good as the previous review of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews before making reservations for Easter and was pleasantly surprised.  Food was good, pricing was reasonable, service was excellent and the decor is uplifting - bright and airy inside and great seating outside.  Will go back."}
{"text":"I met my wife for a late Sunday lunch and our experience was much different from our previous visits. Started off with a quick stop to the restroom before sitting down. The men's bathroom was filthy. The urinal and the floor looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks.  I helped myself to a table while I waited for my wife. It took 10 mins to be recognized. The 1st server introduced herself and and a 2nd server brought my tea over without the sweetener I had asked for. I asked again and waited long enough to where I had to get up and go to the bar and get it myself. It was nearing 100* outside and I was needing something cold to drink.   The waite staff just isn't trained well.   The food was what was expected but the service and cleanliness of the restaurant make me rate a 2"}
{"text":"My wife and I took our 3 and 1 year olds to the Ivey for lunch. We were craving mediteranian food but didn't want to go to an order up diner restaurant.  Atmosphere looks high end but lunch was reasonably priced and was great for our young kids. Lunch came out to around $40 and was delicions.  There was a wine tasting event in the patio.  Windows were open and we were able to hear live music from the event.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Start with Flaming Cheese Appetizer  the fries are very special. Great flavors everywhere  went with a few people so I tried lots of stuff. The  bold and fresh taste makes me want to come back and try more. Lots of screens on one half so there was plenty to catch your attention. Seating was interesting. Some couches, tables, bench and bar. We had fun"}
{"text":"Take out was really great. Mussels where my favorites but all was good :)  .  Ps, this place also has oftrack betting ."}
{"text":"We went here on our lunch break for my birthday last month. Three of my coworkers and me. It took me a while to decide if I was going to write a review or not, once the nausea and stomachache were gone I figured I should attempt to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  There were two or three other tables there, nothing crazy. We were seated, it took a while for someone to come to us so we put in our entire order at one time drinks and lunches. Servers kept walking by our table ignoring us, we finally got our drinks. I was out of water trying to get anyone's attention for a refill my attempts were unnoticed. Oh well I'll ask when the food comes. Server dropped the food and left. Never to come back. We had to go ask for our tabs. One by one since they brought one at a time. We get out food, for the price I would have expected a little more... Oh well I'll have an amazing birthday dinner so this is just lunch.  I ate half my gyro my friend ate half her shrimp appetizer. The meat in the gyro looked strange so I was a little curious, oh well I'm hungry. Went back to work with our leftovers my other friend had half hey gyro left too.  About 30-45 minutes after getting back to work here come the stomach problems felt sick... So sick. I run to the bathroom and well there goes my half of my gyro. So I go and throw away the rest of it. My friend comes up to my desk she too is having some stomach distress. I don't think this is a coincidence.  I was so excited for a Mediterranean place to open close to home and work... Also I adore the patio and ambiance. Oh well I would suggest steering clear maybe go by one of the many other options we have in the area."}
{"text":"They deserve zero stars. Seriously sat at our table for 20 minutes and no one even so much as acknowledged us. The waiter brought at least 2 rounds of drinks to the table next to us and easily stopped at all of the other tables twice and then immediately turned and walked away without even looking in our direction. We got up to leave and the hostess didn't even seem to care that we left before even getting water. We gave this place multiple chances and have been disappointed each time, but never as much as this time. We even came here for our wedding rehearsal and they majorly messed up with their servers lacking timeliness, but thought it was just he large group that caused it. Nope, that's just the staff. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the time of year to go to Ivy. The patio is amazing! The food is perfect, the owner is sincere, engaging, and brilliant. This is my go-to place for a remarkable evening or to entertain for work. The friendly atmosphere, their attention to the details, the live entertainment make it the perfect party spot. I will be entertaining again next week and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Just went to The Ivy for the first time. Great live music! Nice atmosphere and staff. Looking forward to an evening on their great patio. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We are not coming back. One server on at dinner time. What is going on? Actually there was one table still waiting on the server. So we had to get up and get someone to take our order. We were a party of 3. We ended up leaving because service took forever. Not happy at all! Very disappointed....no manager came to talk to us. Trying another Greek restaurant....if I could give it zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I highly recommend checking this place out. :) The food is reasonably priced. The place is clean and the workers are very very friendly! The ivy fries are my favorite"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. Here early enough for the happy hour and tried the Spanikoputa and the Calamari. The Spanikoputa is more delicate than the usual version and a great version. The Calamari with the marinara was excellent, tender but not greasy.  I had a surprising option, the fish tacos which were fantastic using grilled Swai and just a touch of heat. My wife had a chicken pita where the chicken was tender and moist. Glad to have found that is new place and will be back."}
{"text":"Newly opened in Chandler, new cuisine and fantastic addition. Mediterranean/Greek food, everything was fresh and felt light. Our servers were great and funny. We even met the owner, Christof (from Greece of course) which was very nice. I had the spaghetti carbonara which I haven't made since I was in Italy and it was absolutely delicious (highly recommended), yes even the pasta was not heavy and not overpriced like a lot of places ($10-12, forgot which). She had the flank steak with spinach which was tender. We dine in the outside patio with nice large shade trees which was so nice with the current weather, so better go soon before the heat comes and soak it up. Happy Hour we missed but they have $5 glass and $20 bottle of a selected red and white, all day every day so that's awesome. Definitely trying it all on the menu especially the lunch menu looks amazing, although I think I'll be getting the spaghetti carbonara a lot!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour with friends! The food is great, the drinks even better, and the live music creates a great atmosphere for a cool night in AZ. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place - great atmosphere !   Staff and service very friendly / wine list with perfect selections-  had the shrimp appetizer and lamb skewers...delicious!!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went for Happy Hour. The appetizers were 1/2 off which is a good value. The calamari was cold and rubbery. The Spanakopita was so different from the many I have had, just spinach inside no seasoning, just not my taste. We also had Greek salad with gyro meat, it was ok nothing special. Service was OK."}
{"text":"1/2 price appetizers and discounted beer/wine every day during Happy Hour.  Two nice choices are shrimp w/egg plant and mussels.  Nice sized and flavorable pitas.  Everyone was friendly and timely.  Waiting for cooler weather to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! I've had my eye on this place for awhile, incredible service from the moment we walked through the door. We decided to sit at the bar and we are so thankful we did! Brandon was our bartender and he was the best! Not only did he have a wealth of knowledge in regards to the menu but he is also incredibly personable and so easy to talk to! My husband had the lamb burger and he was so impressed, I went with the shrimp squires and I cannot believe how flavorful they were! We were so impressed I booked my upcoming birthday party here! Totally worth the drop in if you are curious!"}
{"text":"Last night 6 of us went to The Ivy as we usually do on Tuesdays. We were shocked to see the changes to the happy hour menu and the price increases. All the items normally half off were now full price and the portions appeared smaller. We won't be back. There are many more and better options than The Ivy at these prices."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time at The Ivy. I had high hopes because of all the great reviews. Unfortunately we had terrible service and bad food. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The patio here is beautiful and great for a relaxing evening catching up with friends. There are multiple tables with couches and chairs to lounge on. We shared some appetizers, sangria, and dessert.   We shared bruschetta, shrimp and eggplant, and the trio of hummus. Out of the three I loved the shrimp and eggplant the best. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, perched on top of a crispy breaded eggplant slice with a bright red tomato sauce. I also liked the bruschetta and the hummus, but there weren't enough pita triangles to go with the large amount of hummus we were served.  The sangria was a nice blend of fruity flavors and wine. We shared the lava cake and cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake was smooth, rich, and creamy. The lava cake didn't have the molten center indicative of the dish, but it did taste good nonetheless.  Service was cheerful and friendly and we were checked up on as needed.  Overall, a really nice place for a meal.  P.S. Their patio is dog friendly. :)"}
{"text":"I can see this being a nice atmosphere for drinks with friends, but I wouldn't suggest this place for dinner. My boyfriend and I went for dinner a few weeks ago - we ordered sangria (which was quite gross, it was not how sangria typically is - it tasted like a cheap red wine - did not have any fruit, no sweetness to it, and probably no brandy it's like they had no idea what sangria was), he got a pasta dish that was \"okay\", and I got the hummus trio. The only thing good about the hummus trio was the pita bread...it said it came with veggies and I expected cucumber and carrots - but it was all celery, gross. The hummus wasn't very flavorful. This place is twice the price of Pita Jungle and not even close to being as good. If you want good hummus, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout order online at 3:00 gave a pickup time of 5:30. When I got home everything was ice cold. Food quality was not worth the price. When you walk in the door its more of a bar than anything. No host to greet you so you just stand at the bar until someone bothers to look your way."}
{"text":"Our server Brandon was excited to serve us and offered us plenty of time to decide.  We had spanikopita for appetizer which I highly recommend and the main courses didn't disappoint!  Give this place a try your going to love it.  Thank you Ivy for a wonderful date night."}
{"text":"Nice place. Spacious and comfortable. We came on a Monday night with a fairly large party and took advantage of the back room they have, which was nice as it provided a semi-private space. Our waitress was fabulous and the food was generally very good. My colleagues all enjoyed their meals. I was less than impressed with the pesto penne pasta as I found it to be lacking flavor but others raved about others raved about their meals so must give them credit for that. The 10% discount with your yelp check-in doesn't hurt the rating either."}
{"text":"The Ivy used to be on my list of restaurants I liked to visit when I was back home visiting my parents.  After my last visit, I am seriously disappointed in the food and service.  Last time I went, I had the chicken pita with a Greek salad.  The components of the pita tasted fresh, but the chicken was kind of rubbery.  The dressing was decent, but nothing blew me away.   The big negative was the service was absolutely terrible.  The guy just did not seem to care, he seemed more concerned at acting cool.    I do think the atmosphere is nice, although the location is a little awkward.  There are better Mediterranean restaurants in the area, and from now on I will be visiting those instead."}
{"text":"Wine selections  vastly improved, very good pours.  Can only speak to a few dishes shrimp apps are great,  skewers, chicken, lamb and shrimp are  great.  Staff is very attentive. Owner is great really does care about the customer."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit. Was looking forward to an after work treat. We got off work at 8 and saw they were open until 10. Perfect. We arrived at 850 and was told the kitchen is closed and we already had last call for drinks.   so I guess my message to others is call ahead even if it says they are open to make sure they are open the kitchen is open and the bar is still serving."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to some great Mediterranean food. You won't find it here. They cooked the New Zealand lamb to point that it was inedible. My side came out 10 minutes after my entree. My partners crab cakes should have been called filler cakes. We did find a crab shell. Our server was abrupt and rude. Apparently she doesn't care about tips. Should have stuck with Pita Souvlaki."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party for Mom in law and had fantastic food, service and the private room was very nice. Have to say it was a fantastic evening and recommend...and seriously affordable for the food we had. Yummy"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, there was a guy playing guitar which was nice.  Food is their version of Mediterranean favorites that they state set them apart.  Mine overall was messy to eat, a club type pita concoxion with hot sauce, it was ok  but not great, edible but not memorable and wont try it again.Either you go there really liking the spin off or you dont.  Other locals seem to be there for drinking with friends. Overall good, not fantastic or outstanding but good.  This can only be based on the 2 items I tried, I may go back to try others because I may of ordered a one off dish.  Girlfriend liked her salad but also felt 3 start was the mark."}
{"text":"Bland Food - Miserable Service! I went to the Ivy at 2 PM on a Saturday. The place was empty . I ordered Mediterranean Hummus and a Greek Salad. The Hummus was very bland almost tasteless .  After 25 minutes still no Greek Salad. Impatient by now and assuming the Greek Salad would be as bland as the Hummus, I canceled the order paid up and left. Not sure why anybody would eat here but now I realize why it was empty on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the Sunday after Christmas.  very nice place, well appointed and friendly staff.  had a couple appetizers.  had the trio hummus that was a 10, fantastic. mussels were disappointing, didn't go well with the tomato base and very fishy. going back this weekend to have dinner.  dinner menu looks great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My only regret is not trying it sooner.  Our server was Anthony, and he was so helpful and attentive. He told us about all their amazing specials and events, as well great recommendations on the menu for not only dinner and happy hour but for drinks and brunch as well. The food was SO good. I got the spanikopita and chicken skewers. OMG. So good. Generous portions too. I suggest getting multiple items to sample and share.  Atmosphere is super comfortable and the entire team was friendly.  Definitely will be a regular go to now!"}
{"text":"I've grown to love Mediterranean food! Love the food here, this must be the same owners that were at Cyprus Grill which is now closed, because the food are same. My fav is the Greek salad and hubby likes the pork skewers. The calamari could use a little more flavor a little bland, but overall I love their food! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mediterranean food in AZ!  The staff is lovely, ambiance is tranquil and beautiful, and the staff is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. I got the chicken pesto pasta and it was very bland. I let my boyfriend try it and he even agreed it could have used some salt. The hummus was good and the saganaki was tasteful. My boyfriend got the gyro, but said he preferred the ones from Cyprus grill down the street. The waiter was excellent-- super nice and very attentive. The set-up of the restaurant was beautiful and had a great vibe. I'll probably go back and try something else that hopefully has a little more taste to it."}
{"text":"We were part of a large birthday group and received terrible service. There were dirty dishes stacked everywhere, our server was very inattentive. I understand they had been very busy prior to our arrival but that is no excuse for the service we received. I had to ask for our table to be cleaned because there was literally no space to set our drinks down. The wine was great = 1 star The charcuterie board was great = 1 star They have a great patio but unfortunately it's just not enough to get me back there. We left and went next door for dinner at Nando's....great service there and much busier."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for mother's day along with my siblings and dad, and right off the bat the service was terrible. I understand when a restaurant is short staffed it's harder on the servers there, but the girl with red hair was by far one of the rudest servers i've ever had the displeasure of meeting. It might be because they were slammed earlier on in the day and she was in a bad mood but while we were here, there were about 4 families, if that. My parents really like the restaurant and have been here multiple times, it was the first and last time me and my siblings will be coming here. Highly don't recommend this restaurant. My sister ordered lamb chops, and the first time it came out dripping blood, so she sent it back and the second time it was extremely pink, when she ordered it well done. No one came to refill our drinks once they brought the waters out to the table. I ordered a chicken gyro w/ no tomatoes or onions and it came with both in it. After bringing our food our server didn't come to the table whatsoever except when she came to hand us the bill. We did speak to the assistant manager and he was extremely nice about it, and the busser Jacob was also extremely kind so that did make up for some of it. Brandon is assistant manager did take the lamb chops off and comp 20% of the bill- in general he was extremely kind about the whole situation. Honestly the whole vibe was only killed because of the red haired waitress and how rude she was. Giving 2 stars because of Brandon and Jacob."}
{"text":"The Ivy was great. Really intimate atmosphere that was decorate very well. My wife and I came in around 8pm and had a very professional and attentive server.   We tried the calamari which was good, the seafood dish which is always a great choice and the pulled pork risotto cakes. The waitress was kind enough to recommend a great bottle of wine that went well with everything. Will come back again for more Mediterranean dishes!"}
{"text":"Brandon treated us really well and the food was great. Live music was also fantastic. One of our favorite local spots.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite happy hour spot!! Love the people and the vibe. We come every week, and get great service from Megan and Chris :) All the other servers are great as well!"}
{"text":"So took the drive out to Chandler  Because I had never trying restaurant The Ivy... I have to say I am extremely super impress great point little place the even had some track betting which you would even know what walking in. Manager bartender Brandon took great care of us...... Recommended the strength and eggplant appetizer and I have to tell you absolutely impressed totally  Delicious. The lamb chop skewers as a main meal...Its was very tasty as well.  OK so then order dessert because I am a big tiramisu fan let me tell you it melts in your mouth totally amazing. I do recommend the Bloomsberry Mule. I am definitely coming back and the manager even said that they have once a month a Brazilian band that brings in over 200 people so I definetly have to check that out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a fantastic wine selection.  Parking can be quite difficult on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, was a little noisy at first with people around the bar watching horse racing but quieted down after a bit.  Food was great, will return again, this time we will be able to enjoy the live music outside on the patio."}
{"text":"We came here for our holiday Christmas party and we were all very happy with our experience. Some of the food came out a little too \"saucy\", but overall we had a great time. The drinks were good, the food was great and the service was amazing. The Asst.GM was helping us and was on top of everything for the night. We had a reservation, the table was ready for us and we had beverages within five minutes or less. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time and we had no complaints. We will definitely come back for more intimate dinners here, we had a great time!! Highly recommend his place."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and decor.  The lamb skewers are delicious.  The chefs board is big enough for 4, bring your hunger. Great addition to the area. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago. Sat out on the patio and enjoyed listening to a very talented singer with an acoustic guitar. Great ambiance outside. The food was really good too. We had several appetizers, including the Saganaki (flaming cheese, which was awesome) and then shared the lamb chops. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the appetizers were all interesting and tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic patio with great atmosphere inside or out.  Good live music on the weekends.  Good food and great service from the staff."}
{"text":"Well rounded menu from people who know Mediterranean food! The flavors are out of this world and the waiters and owners are the nicest people. Great environment :)"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to some great Greek/Mediterranean food before coming to this restaurant, but I feel like I could have gotten a better meal at Pita Jungle. With this being said, the protein on my Greek pita was tough and so was the shrimp on our appetizer. I couldn't even eat my whole pita sandwich. My boyfriend said his lamb wasn't overdone, so if you enjoy that, I think that's all that was worth the price. One star for the ambiance, another for the uber nice server, and the last star is for the lamb (that I did not eat); so I feel I am being generous with my rating.   If there's one thing a restaurant ought to pride themselves in, is how well the meats are cooked and this was a sad, sad fail."}
{"text":"My husband and I just arrived in town for a family wedding and we were so impressed with the atmosphere,  food, and especially our waiter Brandon! He gave excellent recommendations and everything was awesome! We will definitely be back next time we visit!"}
{"text":"Simply the best! Great staff! Unbeatable selection of beverages, entrees and live music!   Get in the know about The Ivy"}
{"text":"Good times, acoustic music great food! Will definitely be back. Had the lamb chops and they were amazing. Wife has a Damon salad, emptied the bowl :)"}
{"text":"The Trio hummus, veggies and pita bread are very delicious , that was five stars for sure!! Great friendly service too. So it's really hard for me to review this restaurant. I have eaten at two of the best Greek restaurant ever that I've been to and they are located in California.  So when I came here to eat I was a little disappointed but I'm pretty much comparing it to Petra Greek and Luna Grill. I had the chicken skewers, Greek salad and rice. My husband had the lamb gyro with fries.(The fries are really good) So maybe if I had eaten at The Ivy before the other two places it would've probably gotten a four star. It is worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Long story short: Bad food, even worse service. Don't go here if you want legitimate Mediterranean food. Don't understand how this place has 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"The food and the ambiance is relatively pleasant, but the service is terrible and everything takes ages to arrive, including a simple glass of wine. This is our second and last time here."}
{"text":"Service was average.  Food was OK but the price of the \"Specialty\" Cocktails are absolutely insane.  The bar Tender promoted his \"Specialty Drinks\" but neglected to inform us of the outrageous over the top price per drink!  Hello we are not at Tavern On The Green in NYC, this is Chandler on Germann!"}
{"text":"On 3/21/18 I organized a wedding shower at the Ivy for colleagues of mine who are doctors who are getting married, and it was truly the best venue and best service I could have wished for. I wasn't sure about the number of guests because at the last minute some people cancelled and some more people wanted to attend, but I knew I wanted to be seated out on the patio around the fire pit and with the flexibility to add more tables and chairs as needed, and I also did not want to be penalized/lose money if less people showed up. 15 people showed up instead of 22, and truly the management at The Ivy was awesome. Just as they promised me, they catered to OUR needs and not the other way around, unlike some of the other restaurants I had tried calling first where I would have had to pay the same amount of money for the reservation no matter how many people showed up. We paid for what we ordered. The patio seating area around the fire pit was beautifully lit and organized, the photos came out great, the Mediterranean food was delicious, the service was awesome and the ambience was so relaxed yet festive. The wedding shower was a huge hit! Thank you to the management and staff at the Ivy!"}
{"text":"The best happy hour menu! We love sitting on the patio when the weather is nice and the indoor decor is lovely as well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday. I had a Pita Gyro. It was OK and the reasonably priced. Bartender was the only person in the place. Serving tables and cleaning up.  Very understaffed. He was very friendly. Dinner items on menu are very expensive. Lunch prices reasonable. Was not impressed by decor inside. Outside seemed much more comfortable with the right weather.  The variety on menu is limited."}
{"text":"Met my boyfriend for dinner on a weeknight. Our server was great and the food was delicious! Really liked the selection for happy hour munchies and the wine list was pretty decent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I got a rose from Mariah. Now I owe her a ring. The food, drinks and service were outstanding. Mariah and Anthony were completely wonderful."}
{"text":"Not good! I was looking forward to the bruschetta. I got the pear and Brie and the tomato and pesto ones. The bread was very soggy and the overall quality was not good. My husband got the burger and felt it was over cooked and dry. My son's quesadilla was enormous, much too big for a kids portion. The service was good but the food was not! Would not go back"}
{"text":"Excellent!  All around  just great.  Love the ambiance, and the cool trendy atmosphere. Service was genuinely friendly and very sincere.  Not the fake, rehearsed routine.     The food was prepared just right.  I had the Paella, and I was pleased that the Shrimp, Muscles, calamari and clams were all very tender.  No overcooled rubbery mess.  We also tried chicken and shrimp skewers and fish tacos and all were delicious. Be sure to have an Ivy Fries as a side with your entire, they are to die for..  Strongly recommend this local gem in Chandler"}
{"text":"Here now. Love the food and atmosphere.  Good drink and food selection. Price is good. Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Great ambience, friendly staff and no wait time for us(party of 2 at 7pm on a Friday evening) our server was very nice and helpful. Food was mediocre though. We got the shrimp and eggplant appetizer - a lot of the eggplants were inedible(chewy and undercooked). The dish lacked zest. We also for the chicken cilantro salad which was ok. The chicken was dry and chewy. Got the gyro pita which was quite blah. Atmosphere was nice. Great for a date night but wouldn't go for the food."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit; my husband and I enjoyed the out door setting and the live music.  Our waitress was very personable and very courteous.  We enjoyed our drinks and the food was very good.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Salmon is wonderful and the bartender is adorable!!! Beautiful atmosphere, will come back"}
{"text":"Lady/Hostess was friendly when greeted us and apologized they were short handed. Followed her to table that she had to clean before seating us using only a wet rag. Long periods of time in between checking in with us to order, to see how things were, if we needed anything etc. The food was good. Not amazing and not terrible. They definitely need more employees as it was a busy lunch day and of all days Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Brandon was a great server! It was a wonderful first experience with live music. We had a gyro and pasta and will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"We found this hidden trendy spot on Groupon. We came on a weekday. So it wasn't busy at all and it was happy hour!  We ordered the Salmon ravioli alfredo and some items off the happy hour menu. You can choose two items for $8. We decided to go with 2 orders of bruschetta, four total. The chicken quesadilla and jalepeno hummus! It was a delicious variety of food.  The salmon ravioli alfredo was my favorite. It had mushrooms, spinach and just a whole bunch of delicious flavors! We tried four different bruschettas that we were all satisfying.   The only con was that our server didn't come by for our water refill. We had to wave her down from the bar.   Besides that everything was great."}
{"text":"Great ambiance both indoors and outdoors.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Great bottle wine selection and decent by the glass.  I decided on the Flank Steak from a pretty good menu variety.  Came with a crispy fresh Greek salad.  The steak was done to my liking and the glaze was perfect!  I'm here on a Tuesday for business but think the locals need to discover The Ivy!"}
{"text":"The service has really declined. We came for happy hour before 6 but waitress did not grant happy hour special on apps, since it showed 6:18pm. Just because she rang it up after is not our problem. Then, she said \"Well, your wine came up as HH.\" Shouldn't everything be then?   Servers are all different and can see why the place is half empty for happy hour and dinner. Such a disappointment, will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's our first time here. Great food and service! Love the hummus here and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE IVY!! so good!! everyone should try it! i got the pan chicken and i recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My toddler and I just got back from having lunch at the Ivy.  While it is not a restaurant geared towards children per se, my little one and I had a great time.  She loved the Ivy fries and I enjoyed the bruschetta (just a word of warning, not your traditional bruschetta but delicious just the same).  I had the quesadilla as well and everything was yummy.  On top of that the service was fantastic.  A very nice treat for a Sunday afternoon.   At the Ivy again and it just doesn't disappoint!  Happy hour pricing and foods are outstanding.  Simply can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This place was great! First the patio is spacious with a variety of seating options. Next the cocktail options are interesting and the beer and wine selections are also decent sized. Our server Lauren was great at explaining the menu, making recommendations and checking back in on our table. She even held up a great conversation when asked about a tattoo, straight with reviews of the shop one of our party was looking at for some work.  Now the food...incredible. The portions were large - no one finished the full plate and everyone loved all that they had. I personally had the Ivy club with Ivy fries - the food tasted fresh and light - but the portion large enough that next time I will share it with a friend. The ivy fries include a lemon sauce and some cheese and I have zero idea why when they are an option that anyone would chose naked fries.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I was working on Saturday and I couldn't decide what to eat and one of the guys I work with recommended this place for lunch and said it was the same owners as Cyprus grill. I looked at the photos, the menu, and reviews and was not too confident I would like it but I decided to give it a shot. Was I glad I did; this place is good! We started with the hummus trio; Mediterranean, jalapeño, and spicy pepper are the flavors and it comes with pita bread and an assortment of veggies. I couldn't believe the portion size of each hummus flavor; it was a meal in itself. As for an entre I was having a craving for pasta but decided with the ivy club sandwich as it had both gyro and chicken. It's a sandwich that is on pita bread; comes with both meats, lettuce, and sriracha but I chose yogurt sauce instead. It's plated with a salad that was rather large. It is a ton of food, literally, and it tastes extremely good. As far as the ambiance I really dig it. Couches, bar, high tables, and normal height tables; open ceilings; large windows that let in a lot of light; a patio; and lots of monitors for sports. Good place for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  Ambiance, Friendly service and very good food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love the food at Cristos and Penelope's other restaurant \"Cyprus Grill\", so we were very excited to finally get a chance to eat there last night! We had the Shrimp and Eggplant Marinara appetizer, Lamb Skewers and Shrimp Skewers. Food was delicious and presentation nice. We were told that we could also order off of the lunch menu, which we will probably do next time. The whole place has a really nice upscale feeling and has a large patio with both tables and several nice seating areas. I hope the comment about ashtrays on the patio isn't true since smoke really ruins it for us. On the downside, they only had two servers last night, but it was late on a weeknight. I'm sure they'll get that sorted."}
{"text":"Great place for a relaxing dinner and increadable drinks! Decor is nice and comfortable and the patio is a great place to eat when the weather is nice. I have been here for brunch and dinner and both were great with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Attended a group function last night. The parking lot is packed so make sure to have ample time to look for parking of be prepared to walk a ways. The restaurant itself is very classy, dim lighting, beautiful art in the walls. Large patio area and quite spacious inside. Service was excellent. I had the leg of lamb gyro which was very good. The Greek fries were also tasty. The menu offers appetizers, modestly price gyros and salads and a menu of entrees in the upper range. It seems everyone at the table ordered something different but it all look amazing. The food did seem to lean a little more Greek but one could argue there is a Mediterranean flair In some of the other dishes. There is a happy hour I intend to try during the week. My only complaint was the extremely short \"by the glass\" wine list. There was only 4 available and not one Greek option. As a wine drink that was disappointing. All in all I highly recommend and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area for my birthday, and was looking for a nice outdoor area to celebrate with friends - enter The Ivy.   The ambiance of this place is very nice. It's pretty casual, but has some upscale aspects to it, as well. I reserved a fire pit area with couches and chairs around it for my guests.    We were consistently well taken care of and ordered everything from gyros to the paella. Everyone enjoyed their food. I highly recommend the paella; it made my day."}
{"text":"We had a lovely Sunday morning brunch today.  The food was delicious and our server and bartender were friendly and courteous.  They need to update their website to tell folks that they are open early on Sundays, as I think people are missing out.  We will be back for brunch and dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Went to The Ivy last night. Beautiful location, great ambiance! The employees are super friendly, food and drinks were delicious! I would definitely recommend this spot for a nice romantic evening or even for groups to lounge and have drinks and food. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere and amazing food!!!  The shrimp and eggplant appetizer is addicting.  There was live music on the patio that made us want to stay after we were done eating.  I usually prefer to leave a restaurant right after Im finished.  And for the bad review about the leaves dropping and the ladies with the hats---nature tends to happen when you eat outside and the hats are a fun tradition for horse racing which that night was advertised as a Kentucky Derby party."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Brandon ( the manager) love the atmosphere and staff!!! The AZ Moscow mule is s must try ."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we stopped in here the other night.  I had read about The Ivy and have been wanting to come in.  This lovely place backs up to Nandos.  I been in this plaza so many time but never saw it.  First thing is noticed was the ambiance.  It's got a casual feel with an upscale menu.  You can sit there for hours.  We were here on a Friday night and got seated right away. I love that. I've become very impatient in my old age.   The seating consists of tables and chairs, high tops, love seats, and you can basically make it whatever experience you want to get out of it.  There's a bar area that you can sit up at as well. Then they also have a huge outdoor seating area.   It's like you're going to your best friends house.  On this night they had an acoustic guitar player outside entertaining the patrons.  I loved it.  My husband and I chose to sit at a high top. The thing that struck my eye was that the chairs were not just your normal stools. They are velour covered chairs and very comfortable. The table itself was a little small for dinner plates and drinks. That was really the only down side to our evening.    We started our evening with an order of the Greek fries. So good!  These were fresh fries with a great dressing and feta cheese on top.  Portion size was great for two.    My husband has been dying for a gyros sandwich. Right away he saw that they had it on the menu. The other plus was that the gyros meat is the cone gyros and not the strips.    He also ordered a small greek salad.  Right away he said the dressing was great.  Then when he finally bit into his sandwich he was surprised again for the amount of gyros meat that was inside.  Overall his meal was a win.  Price on the gyros was $9.00.    I ordered the lamb skewers plate.  The plate came with roasted potatoes with rosemary, a small greek salad, pita, and tzaziki and two lamb skewers. Let me start with the salad. Another thumbs up. My husband was right. The potatoes were somewhat of a miss. Portion was great but unevenly cooked. I had some that were cooked properly and some that weren't cooked all the way. Then I'll leave the lamb skewers for last.  OMG!  There were two skewers with six chunks each.   These were THE BEST lamb skewers  I've eaten outside of my home ever!  The lamb melted in my mouth.  I had one or two pieces with a little too much grizzle but the others were great. Overall an over the top to die for  meal.  My plate was $18. But very worth it.    Don't pass this place up.  Next time we go we plan on sitting outside to enjoy this weather."}
{"text":"This is our first time here at the Ivy and I personally recommend this place for some really great food. I ordered the Ivy club which is Gyro meat, grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, feta cheese, and stomachs served between two pitas. It was delicious and the portion was huge. Needless to say we needed to go boxes. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Whatever questions we asked they had answers to. We sat at the bar to eat our lunch and they have the most comfortable bar stools. The interior is very cozy and inviting. they also have an outdoor patio with nice seating. They have big screen TV's for sports and also off track betting from Turf Paradise.They also have live music on Friday and Saturday nights from 7:00- 10:00. They have awesome daily specials as well. for instance on Tuesday they have big a pita get a pita free. Not to brag but I am a BOGO Queen. Thursday's special is $15 brunette board and a bottle of wine. I am definitely looking forward to my next visit here to sample some more of their menu selections."}
{"text":"The Ivy was a great place to eat, I loved their laid back vibe.  It's definitely a fun place to eat and the food was great.  Took the waitresses suggestion on the appetizer, just basic jalapeño hummus and pita, it was excellent.  I ordered the Lamb Pita and couldn't have been happier with my selection.  Probably the best Pita I've had since Israel and that's saying a lot!  If you are looking for a great place for a date night or to entertain some friends, this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciate restaurants the most when they do not rush my experience. The Ivy slowly fed me for three hours! They were not pushy or impatient and the food was delicious! I loved sitting by the fire in the sunshine reading my book and sipping my drinks while the small plates came out! Turn your back to the street and it almost feels lakeside. I also loved their 90s Rock playlist! Very easy and refreshing to listen to! The only reason they don't have 5 stars from me is because their dessert menu is bullshit. Lava cake and New York cheese cake at a Mediterranean restaurant? Those are crowd pleasers and show no substance or heritage. They do have a well priced brunch with $15 bottles of champagne and oj! I will be back but not for the dessert lol"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best atmosphere as well as best patio! They're happy hour is great half off all their appetizers which are all excellent the only thing I wish they had on there was maybe something with chicken or beef. There gyros and other sandwiches are so good the chicken sandwich is always perfectly grilled chicken. The Greek salad is so good and has a wonderful dressing with it.  Also a bonus you can bring your dog on the patio which we love and often times there is live music out there as well! The orange margarita is fantastic and they always have great wine! Love this place;)"}
{"text":"This should be a first rate place. It isn't, due to  the lack of management. Food was served family style, but without utensils. Staff were a bunch of amateurs, trying to look like they knew what they were doing. Food was delicious, and that is such a shame! Mensroom was a filthy disgrace. Made me wonder what the kitchen is like! Sure wish this place had their act together."}
{"text":"Incredible food my group of three thought everything was very tasty. The hummus appetizer plate had fresh crisp veggies to dip and amazing pitas. My lamb skewers ordered with rice was also amazing. Love the sour sauce that was on it. Also the baklava while I have had better was amazing. Would like a little less honey so it's more flaky but either way one of the better ones I have had. Service was amazing and will be returning have actually been thinking about it all day."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and was very disappointed.  The Grilled Chicken Pita was blah.  The chicken was grilled nicely and the Pita bread was good but the Tzatziki was tasteless.  I had it with the side of Greek salad which was also disappointing.  It had one so-so olive and the lettuce was torn in large pieces while the tomato-cucumber was chopped into small pieces,  but that isn't my biggest complaint,  the dressing was so sweet, I couldn't eat it.  I also ordered a glass of wine based on a recommendation by the server.  I couldn't drink it, clearly the bottled had been open way too long.  If you are going to charge $15 for a glass of wine it really should be from a bottle that has been open for more than a week.  It was gross.  I will say the server was really nice and so was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a cute place.... that knows nothing about Mediterranean food. If you order bruschetta get it extra toasted. They only lightly toast their bread and 1. No one wants a soggy soft piece of bread and 2. Bruschetta literally translates to burnt bread. Bruschetta is also Italian not Mediterranean so I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up to begin with. Very disappointed. Also a heads up if you order the bruschetta with capicola, they slice it very thick which makes it completely inedible. We also ordered the saganaki which was basically a plate of hot grease. The cheese wasn't cooked enough; would not recommend. The salmon salad was just okay. Would only go back again for drinks and maybe some fries.... aka we're never going back there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone that works here is awesome! Shout out to Chris, Brandon, Killer, Chelsi, Lauren, Anthony, and of course the owner Christos! Service, food, ambiance wonderful!"}
{"text":"In its former life, this space was a beautiful classy chic inviting restaurant and bar and even after it's reincarnation as The Ivy, it was nice, good food, nice atmosphere. We hadn't been here in awhile and were surprised when we came today to find OTB booths off to the side and gamblers drinking beer and yelling at the tvs as they lost their bets. Yeah, WILL NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been to The Ivy and I have to say, we love it. The atmosphere is great, trendy, cool vibe. The staff is beyond friendly and not pushy. The first time we came there was a dj playing great, top 40 music. The wine list is great and they've got a dozen beers on tap. The hummus is delish. I had fish tacos both times and they are outstanding. My hubs stuck with the lamb both times and really liked it. I think the prices are very reasonable and like that they have a kids menu. This is a fantastic addition to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh salads. Tasty shrimp and lamb. Chef should check that all mussels opened naturally ss unopened mussels can be bad. A little dark, but pleasant atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a girls night out. Since it was a nice weather outside, we've decided to sit in the patio area. What a beautiful place to hang out with my girls! Appetizers were great as always, drinks were awesome and our waiter was funny and amazing! We asked him to take our photos (he did a good job BTW), I found his selfie on my phone lol several times he even stopped by to check up on us...then he dance as he walked away from our table.   I'll definitely come back here again. Love the service food and the staffs.  Note to owner: thank you so very much for opening this restaurant in Chandler. It is beautiful like Scottsdale restaurants without the snobbiest"}
{"text":"We walked in around 6:30ish and no was around to greet us. When the staff came out they sat and chatted for a few minutes amongst themselves. My friend had to ask if they were going to seat us. After ordering a bottle of wine the server came back and apologized saying they were out of that specific bottle. When my friends chose another bottle they found a bottle of our original choice..awesome.  However The food was terrible. I've had better store bought hummus. The server who served us our sagnaki had a lighter malfunction. I had the chicken pita, it was bland. My friend had the gyro, that was also bland and the meat was dry. Great location and Decor but that's about all. The servers were friendly as well."}
