{"text":"I used to go eat at this place at least once a week from work. All of the sudden I noticed all the employee changed. I am assuming there is new owners. Ever since the quality of food as decreased. The honey/garlic potato I ate today were practically raw and the portion size decreased. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"Koryo is one of the fast food places in the food court in Place Montreal Trust.  It is a chain but one of the lesser known ones.    They serve Korean food.  On my most recent visit I had the Beef Udon Soup ($7.99).  It was full of green beans, broccoli, bean sprouts, udon noodles and it had a good sized serving of beef.  The beef was grilled to order.  It was well marinaded and had a lot of flavour.  Unfortunately, it wasn't that lean of a cut and it had lots of sinewy bits.  The lady at the counter gave me a sample of their garlic potatoes, which was quite delicious.  The sauce is sweet and sticky.  While I was waiting for my order, a woman came up and just ordered a plate of the garlic potatoes and the glass noodles (Jap Chae).  The lady at the counter said that that was quite common that customers just order their side dishes to eat as their main course because they are that great.  The lady at the counter was really nice and sweet.  Koryo is one of the better choices at the Place Montreal Trust food court in my opinion."}
{"text":"I can't give 4 stars cuz I'm not fan of food court places but anyways I was in a hurry doing some Christmas shopping so stopped by there for a quick bite. I ordered the Koryo Jumbo deal, that thing has everything (short ribs, beef, a chicken thigh, 4 choices of sides plus 2 scoop of rice). It was a good deal for the price, lots of food, the garlic potatoes were very nice. The glass noodles were also very good. I usually have quick bites at Torinos (whenever I eat at food court's, I go for Torinos) but I think I will switch to this place every once and then."}
{"text":"Ce fast food a tout d'un grand restaurant asiatique. La générosité qualifie ces assiettes bien exécutées, avec des assaisonnements justes et des saveurs équilibrées. La viande grillée sous tes yeux jure de tendreté. Si tu manges sur place, demande néanmoins à la faire couper car les couteaux en plastique ne feront pas l'affaire. Les accompagnements abondent: du riz nature d'office + 2 autres garnitures au choix (pommes de terre à l'ail, haricots verts, brocolis, tofu,...). Les légumes apportent du croquant et la sauce brillante rallie le tout à merveille.  L'équipe ne parle pas très bien français, mais chacun se montre aimable et prévenant.  Mon coup de coeur: le steak Koryo accompagné de riz, pommes de terre à l'ail et brocolis.  Mon astuce: Chaque jour, une promotion est proposée: 1 plat + 1 boisson fontaine au prix du plat.   Avis initialement publié dans mon blog culinaire \"Délice ou Supplice\" (lien dans ma bio)"}
