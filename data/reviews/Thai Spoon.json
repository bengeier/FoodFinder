{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Nice quiet atmosphere for lunch or dinner!  I recommend the Bangkok curry!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here tonight after purchasing a new car minutes before to celebrate. It was the best experience and the food was wonderful. Our waitress was the best out there -so kind and helpful and fast!  What a pleasant surprise to find this new favorite place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always frequent Thai Spoon after hanging in Dormont and it is delicious. The atmosphere is laid back and the restaurant itself is very quaint. The staff is friendly and very attentive and their food is delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Thai!"}
{"text":"Got a curry dish and a noodle dish here for take-out. I was super underwhelmed, especially for the price. I would gladly drive out of my way for Noodlehead and save $10+ for way better food."}
{"text":"After extensive scientific research, I declare Thai Spoon to have the best green curry in the city!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! This restaurant is owned by the same family that used to own the Thai Cuisine restaurant in Bloomfield I believe. We stopped in for lunch last Sunday, and both had the drunken noodle. One with chicken, and one with shrimp, both were very tasty, and the right spice level at an 8. We also had an order of the steamed dumplings, they paired well with their accompanying sauce. All in all, this was an excellent experience, and I am glad that there is finally a Thai restaurant nearby!"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out recently and had a great experience. We ordered the Spicy crispy noodles and the chicken pad thai. Both meals were really good w/ generous portions."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is Chicken Pad See Ew. BYOB."}
{"text":"This place is BYOB for a minimal fee, which is great! We had the pork buns, drunken noodles, and crispy duck. Everything was delicious, especially the chili paste that went with the pork buns. The service is friendly and efficient, but be mindful of the time because they start to clean up a half hour before closing. Overall, a great place for a casual date night. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Decent local Thai food. Friendly staff, decent spice level, and BYOB. No, it is not Nicky's. This place is still worth a shot though."}
{"text":"Last minute stop here on a Saturday night. Had the house noodles heat 4 . It was amazing! Melt in your mouth. Flavor and heat were spot on!  Everyone in my party had something different and we all enjoyed. 

Try the Thai iced tea, a little sweet but delish."}
{"text":"I love this place! I either get the beef drunken noodles, or the green curry. Their pork buns are also amazing. Everything that I have gotten from here is amazing. They give you plenty of food, I normally have dinner for two or three nights! Although their prices are a tad high, I think you are getting great quality and quantity of food. It's clean, the waitresses give you water and are very nice while you wait for takeout. It's hands down my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in Dormont and I'm always willing to walk to a place where the food is good, staff are friendly and prices are reasonable! Love it!"}
{"text":"Same menu as Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield. It was okay, not the best Thai food, but not the works. I ordered the spicy basil entree with chicken and when the server brought it out, no rice came with it, which is odd because the menu said that it did. So, the server forgot the rice. I did eventually get it after asking, but it was very odd considering the place wasn't  that busy. Spice level of 8, was not at all spicy. Asked for chili sauce,  but it never came."}
{"text":"Delish!!!!   Service is excellent as well as the food.   The noodle soup I could eat daily.   Small but cozy.   Byob."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place since it opened and it didn't disappoint. Good Thai food, at least in our minds, is tough to find in the South Hills area, and with this place less than a mile from our house, we were hoping it was good.

It was. The menu is large and the prices are very reasonable. We ordered Pad Thai and Red Curry Chicken. Both of which were delicious (though I wish my curry was a bit spicier). Our appetizers were the summer rolls and the peanut sauce was delicious. The inside is small, and they use a portable AC in the summer, so it can be a little noisy, but the service was great, food was fast and we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai is Nicky's and Smiling Banana Leaf....but I'm in the South Hills and sometimes I don't want to drive there for a quick dinner.  Enter Thai Spoon.  I've heard about it for quite some time but until recently haven't tried it.  Finally, I did and I'm glad.

All of the items my family chose were extremely flavorful.  

The Bangcock curry was excellent albeit a bit sweeter than other curries I've tried.  Still an excellent choice.

Also had the Pad See Ew.  I think it was on par with the other places I mentioned above which is a good sign as this is my favorite Thai Dish.  I ordered it 5, but probably should have gone with a 6 just to kick up the heat to make it perfect.

All in all, I really liked Thai Spoon and will make this my go-to Thai place, mainly out of convenience.  However, it won't make me abandon the 2 best Thai restaurants in the city all together."}
{"text":"First time trying thai food & we weren't disappointed.  3 spice chicken was delicious & a lot of food. Husband got peanut steak & he wouldn't get it again. Avocado rolls were the best!! Byob & waitress was willing to send someone to go get a bottle of wine if we didn't have one. Small, casual atmosphere - I could see it being loud if the place was packed luckily with Potomac closed it wasn't busy at all. We would recommend & will go back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Thai Spoon! I've tried Thai restaurants all over Pittsburgh and this one is definitely my favorite! Everything is always fresh, plentiful, and presented really well. The service is always very friendly and quick. Ever since they expanded, theres typically no longer a wait on the weekends which is great. They do take reservations though if you're worried. I always recommend to new friends to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Charming staff with very friendly service. The first time I went, the pad Thai was a little off. I rarely complain but the server noted I'd barely touched mine and soon the chef came out and offered to send me home with a new batch, which was unnecessary, but a great, nice touch!  We went back and I had a fish curry that was delectable. BYOB."}
{"text":"Bad. I'm sorry, but it's just bad. The prices they charge for this lackluster food and inept service are completely laughable.

It's not even that it's so inedible, it's just that there are much better places in Pittsburgh to eat Thai food and although this is the only Thai restaurant in the general Dormont area, if you're willing to be a little flexible then there is much better Asian food to be had around there. I can't really think of any good reason to come here."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not great.  I've had way better."}
{"text":"Delicious food and one of the few thai places that can make curries without the fish sauce. BYOB is great. My only complaint is they can't make meals spicy enough. No matter how \"Thai hot\" you tell them to make it, they just don't. Otherwise, this is one of the top Thai places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Check It out! New Thai place in Dormont right on Potomac. we came here for lunch and was pretty happy with all aspects of the establishment.

The place is very small, maybe 8 tables. But that is good because there was only one server but even with about half the tables full the service was very good. I had the green curry which was absolutely spectacular and would say that is on par with what a great curry should taste like.  In my opinion the consistency of the \"broth\" was perfect, with a nice creamy flavor with not too much heat as I requested a 5 on the spiciness scale of 1-10. The lady ordered the pad thai which I thought could have been a little bit better. It was sort of blah, I think it needed some lime, possibly cilantro and some chopped peanuts. The lunch pad thai also came with a side salad that will catch you off guard if your not careful. The salad doesn't look like much but it packs a ton of flavor. It was hard to determine what was in the clear white dressing that was on the salad but it was sweet and spicy which was very tasty for this dude.

The server was really friendly and took sometime to chat which I always appreciate and I hope this place is successful. Lastly the dinner menu looked way larger than the lunch menu with many typical Thai dishes. I will be certain to report my findings in the future on the dinner."}
{"text":"Love Thai Spoon!  Everything that I have gotten from there is delicious.  My favorite is the Bangkok Curry.  Takeout is always quick and always hot."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Thai food in various cities in the US and Thai Spoon is very good, fairly priced."}
{"text":"Stopped here Saturday night on our way home. I'm always wary about trying a new place because of my allergies, but the staff was friendly and knowledgeable about what I could eat and gave me several options. They were able to accommodate my restrictions with no problem or hassle. Boyfriend and I were starving so we were excited by how prompt the service was- the server was attentive and our food came out quickly. The food was very good and as boyfriend lives just down the street we'll be sure to be back."}
{"text":"A cilantro lover's paradise, my Tom Yum shrimp soup had three large shrimp with tails.  It had a nice amount of heat and lots of cilantro.  I also had the grilled chicken mango salad.  The mango was fresh and perfectly cut into matchstick slices.   The chicken was tender and flavorful.   The red onion complemented the vinegar bite of the dressing.   The delivery was within the time given, and everything was fresh and tasty.   We will be regular customers."}
{"text":"I love the location- the brick streets ! Parking might be a bit of toughie but I got some in less than 5 mins on a Sunday evening . There are a few Thai options in that area and we picked Thai spoon as it had the most number of reviews .
The Place wasn't crowded at all but definitely a lot of take out orders .
It's a typical small sized restaurant- nothing exceptional there.They have a decent menu - lots of options to choose from . 
Now the food :
There has probably never been a bigger disappointment than the Tom Yum soup served at the Thai spoon :( I've had the Tom yum in Thailand and atleast a dozen other countries and also a lot here in NJ but never have I ever gotten a hot water bowl with chilies and mushroom and chicken - no taste other than the chili water and absolutely no consistency to the broth! Please please avoid at all cost - try only if you haven't had a Tom yum before .
The drunken noodles were nicely done - they got this one right ! 
The Thai red curry chicken had way too much coconut - you could feel the coconut powder in the gravy. And a little too sweet as well 
So given that I have a lot of other well reviewed Thai restaurants to try out - will give Thai spoon a miss for some time to come ."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke . Dirt bag drug addicts that work here. They take the phone off the hook at 9 when they close at 10 so they can get out and get their fix. What a scumbag operation!!"}
{"text":"Thai Spoon is probably the best Thai restaurant in the South Hills and it was probably one of the first Thai joints to pop up in south of the city. Despite its expansion, it is still an intimate little space. I've tried a lot of items from their menu and everything has tasted great and fresh. I find that their noodle dishes are some of the best in the city, specifically their Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. Their flavors are well-balanced: not too sweet, not too salty and not too tangy. They also include a lot of veggies in their Drunken Noodles that other places might leave out. I've also tried their soups (specifically Tom Yum and Tom Kha) and although they taste good, they seem a little one-dimensional compared to other Thai restaurants I've tried. All in all, the food is tasty and it's a great place for Thai if you're in the south hills area."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much! I definitely think they're a top contender for plain-ole good Thai food in the city! 

The place is very cute inside. It is comfortable, clean, and casual-classy, but inviting. The staff is very nice and you can see their true willingness to make good product. 

We started our meal with crab rangoons, which were excellent! We then both got the pad thai and I thought it was fantastic. It wasn't smothered in sauce that drowned the wonderful vegetables and noodles, but instead coated them perfectly. 

It's a great and welcome addition to Dormont!

ps... it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Very good food, really nice server, i think his name was Derek.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is very small.  If your looking for authentic Thai food that tastes great this is the place.  Service was excellent too!!"}
{"text":"This place was decent, but maybe I've just been spoiled by Smiling Banana Leaf and Pusadee's Garden. I went for lunch while my car tires were being replaced down the street. I had the yellow curry which was good, but the potatoes in it were a little undercooked and the curry was a bit on the watery side. Good taste though and a ton of chicken, which is a huge plus in curry dishes. I would probably return if I'm in the area, but I don't see myself heading out to Dormont just to visit again."}
{"text":"I always get the green curry with chicken and the drunken noodles with chicken they're both super tasty and it's BYOB here (very minimal corkage fee).  On the spice side you can order the heat 1-10-I've gotten 3 and it had good heat for a low request - so good!  Staff is nice and they just expanded to make more seating.  You don't have to get all dressed up to go here but you can if you want :-)"}
{"text":"Much better after being open now for a couple years...more substantial flavor & portions. Both were light when they first opened. 
Nice expanded seating now which makes for a better atmosphere.
I love the lunch specials. NOTE : due to slow weekday business, they're only open for dinner & Friday / Sat / Sun. lunch, now . Big bummer. The Potomac Ave construction/renovation killed their lunch traffic."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place for lunch the other day, and it's pretty good. I had the green curry with chicken, which is my go to dish. The curry was tasty with a nice spice level and the veggies and chicken were fresh and thoughtfully prepared. There are better Thai restaurants in the Burgh, but, as this one is the closest to me, I'll be returning to try more of the menu. A welcome addition to Dormont."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place.  Living in Dormont, we are so fortunate to have a jem like this in walking distance.  I have two staple items that are my go to entrees, the green curry with chicken, and the drunken noodles.  Both of these dishes are just fantastic.  Be careful when being asked about how spicy you like your dishes.  I am a fan of spicy food, but the 4 is plenty spicy for me.

The restaurant itself is tiny, so I would suggest making a reservation.  It is also BYOB. So take along your swill.  I've seen everything from six packs of beer on a table, to the standard bottles of wine.  What is great about the BYOB here, is they charge one dollar per person as a corkage fee.  That is pretty awesome!

Service is friendly and accommodating.  As an appetizer try the spring rolls and pot stickers.  Also give the Thai iced tea a try.  Give this place a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai is my go to order and I find it's a pretty good indicator of how good the rest of the menu usually is. Sadly I don't have a new favorite Thai place near my house like I was hoping for. 

The pad Thai wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good either. Basically just noodles and chicken with a few green onions, mung beans and barely any peanuts sprinkled in. It was lacking the crunch and bright flavor contrast the vegetables provide. They could have tripled the amount of veggies/nuts and I would probably still say it needed more.  

It was hot, came out quickly and service  was friendly so I'll give them a couple stars for that but l'll probably go to other nearby Thai places before I return to this one."}
{"text":"Really good, really fresh. If you like it spicy don't be afraid to ask for \"10\" when you are asked for your spice preference from 1-10."}
{"text":"Tom Yum soup and Pad Thai. That's what I had on my first visit here. It's a small place in quaint downtown Dormont. It's only cooled by a portable air conditioner in the summer months, and it's not super-fancy inside, but the food is wonderful and the service is friendly and attentive. The Tom Yum was awesomely spiced, though a little more chicken would have been nice. Plenty of perfectly-done mushrooms, though.  The Pad Thai was full of sweet and spicy flavor. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in the city of Pittsburgh. Very friendly and accommodating staff with AMAZING food. I've tried something new every time I come for dinner but Pad See Ew is my favorite! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The most legit Thai Food in the Pittsburgh Area - this place trumps Nicky's Thai any day! 

We were looking for Thai places in Mount Lebanon while driving through, and decided to give this place a try. Best decision ever!

We ordered the Tom Yam and chicken lettuce wraps for starters. Both better than other restaurants, but don't expect Thailand standards.

For our mains, we had the Bangkok curry and the Bangkok seafood. Both were excellent! I especially liked the Bangkok seafood as the sauce had a nice egg and turmeric combination. The Bangkok curry was also really good! Meat and seafood in both were good quality.

What blew me away was the dessert! We had the sticky rice with homemade coconut ice cream and peanuts - super delicious! Beautifully presented and the coconut ice cream was very creamy, and it complimented the warm, perfectly textured sticky rice. I've been craving good Asian desserts in Pittsburgh, and I finally found a place! Will definitely be back to try others. 

Service was excellent! We were served by a young guy who was very friendly, not overwhelming at all! Ambience was simple but clean and comfortable. 

Will definitely be back for more! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Thai food I've ever had. That's it. Oh, and the people are really nice too."}
{"text":"Green curry and Pad Thai are awesome. Friendly staff. The $1 per person BYOB is definitely a great deal. Dinner for two with an appetizer was less than $40. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A nondescript store front in Dormont isn't particularly inviting but the search for more Thai restaurants continued with a trip to Thai Spoon. Inside, the restaurant doesn't provide much atmosphere but not many places can match either Nicky's location for a full Thai experience. But my tastebuds convinced me long ago that I'm not there for the atmosphere. I'm there for the spicy tastiness that is awesome Thai food! The place is small for sure but it's cozy enough that you need not worry about sitting in your neighbor's lap.

The menu is pretty extensive and even had some novel dishes I hadn't seen before. We started with some appetizers and the corn fritters were delightful. Unfortunately our other choices were greasy and not especially appealing in appearance or taste. Stick with the spring rolls. No frying involved!

The four of us shared each of our dishes so we had a chance to get a more representative sampling. My spicy calamari dish, ordered at a 9 spice level, was bland and a disappointment. The calamari was rubbery and didn't have enough other things on the plate to compensate. The lack of heat is always a bummer for me. My daughter's drunken noodles, at a 4 spice level, were far hotter than mine. While hers was ok, it wasn't great. Passable would be the most generous description I could give. One of the other dishes was a curry dish but the flavor was weak and the sauce was watery. I'm looking for more depth of flavor and with Thai spices you have the right to expect that! My wife's seafood dish was the best of the bunch and I'd order that next time. It was flavorful and I was glad she shared!

The food was inconsistent and while I wouldn't drive all the way over to the South HIlls to eat here again, if I lived close, I'd give it a few more tries. But there are far better Thai options around."}
{"text":"Pretty great Thai byob. We've had everything from the famous drunken noodles to curries, soups, appetizers, and more. Never been disappointed. They also do take out, which is perfect for a good quick meal. Not the best thai food I've ever had, but in my top ten.

Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"My husband and I dropped in for dinner tonight. We saw good reviews on Yelp and were in town, so we decided to give it a shot. 

Our service from the beginning wasn't great. They weren't that busy inside but we barely saw our server. It seemed we were constantly waiting for her to come back. 

The food itself was good. They had fried veggie dumplings on special so we tried them. They were decent, but a bit lacking in flavor. 

We both ordered the pad Thai. They ask you to choose your spicy ness on a scale of 1-10. I ordered a 7. I was disappointed that it wasn't spicy at all. The food was good - very peanuty in flavor. I just wish it was spicier and thought it should have been. 

I probably would have given it 4 stars if the service had been better. Overall a decent experience, but I felt a little bit like it left something to be desired."}
{"text":"This would be my third visit to a Thai restaurant in the past 2 months. Pusadee's Garden and Smiling Banana Leaf being the other two. I guess, I can't say I don't like thai food anymore...

This place is very small but somewhat cozy. So, if you plan on bringing a group, it's best to RSVP. Also, this place is BYOB!

We ordered the Drunken Noodle and crispy Duck with spring rolls. They were all really good. Overall a great Thai restaurant. Would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"Truthfully, I wasn't too impressed with the food but our waitress made the whole experience better. We came here on a Friday night and we were seated immediately. The place was a lot bigger than I had thought. Our waitress was super nice and friendly.

For appetizer, we ordered the summer roll with shrimp. It was okay as I'm used to the Vietnamese version which tastes a bit better and has more meat/shrimp. For my entree, I got the drunken noodles with fried tofu. It was actually pretty good! The only thing is that I asked for spice level 4 (1 to 10 scale) and it was a bit too spicy for me. The main reason that we came here for dinner was for the mango sticky rice dessert!! I was so excited for this! To my disappointment, it was not good at all. The sticky rice was hard and a bit sweet but the savory sauce on top was just not good. We did enjoy the fresh mango. I would not recommend the dessert. 

Overall, our waitress was really nice and attentive and made sure that everything was good."}
{"text":"Being the Thai obsessed individuals that we are, my husband and I decided to make a trip to Thai Spoon since we were going to be in the area last evening.  The reviews here were what made us decide to give it a try.  We did not think we would be disappointed.  Well, when compared to the Thai that I am very fond of, it was indeed disappointing. 

The spring rolls were decent, very large, but mostly lettuce (I did not mind this so much being that I love lettuce, but my husband said they did not have the hint if basil he is more so accustomed to and enjoys), and the edamame was good (the only place I have ever been to that has messed up edamame was Nakama).  My husband seemed to enjoy the crab rangoon too.  Now on to the entrees, the Chicken Pad Thai was way spicier than the level three that I had asked for... it was almost inedible for someone like me who does not love spicy.  The noodles were not your traditional Pad Thai noodles rather it seemed more so like vermicelli.  Just not good compared to what we like (Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf).  His entree was a Chicken Basil dish (although we suspect a mistake was made as it looked nothing like Chicken basil and did not taste basil-like at all (there was nothing about this that cried even a smidgen of basil).  

The service was good, BYOB is always great, and for a neighborhood that is lacking Thai options, it is a good addition.  I just think that I have just become quite picky with my Thai tastes.  

If you love Nicky's and the Banana Leaf, I think you won't love this place... but you may find something that you like so give it a shot."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for the prices. I haven't been back since they expanded and remodeled but it looks super nice!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the owners seem to try really hard to do a good job, but it appears that they have trouble employing good help. Most are inexperienced and unorganized. Dining in is a more pleasant experience but anytime I order takeout there seems to be an unorganized scramble to get things right. 

Also the kitchen staff is audibly vulgar from the waiting area. And some of the wait staff can be a little harsh. 

I want this place to do well, but they need a more professional staff to do well in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pork buns are delicious as are the curries and drunken noodles. Added bonus- it is BYOB!"}
{"text":"Thai Spoon is fantastic. My go-to order is the Pad See-ew with chicken.  While it's BYOB, the Thai iced tea can't be missed!  

It's not the largest interior, but the food is definitely the focus. The staff is always friendly, and the food comes out incredibly quick. 

I'm not the BIGGEST spice fan, but I can handle some, so I'll usually go with a 4 on their scale."}
{"text":"A lot of good choices tonight. We ordered the corn fritter appetizer. Fried just right with tons of corn kernels. The lemongrass sauce gave it a nice tangy flavor. Tom yum soup had so  many veggies there was little room for broth. I got the volcano ribs for my entree. It was billed as \"extremely spicy\". The ribs were braised and the meat practically fell off the bone. They were spicy but not overbearing. Our server told me that I was the only one who had ever finished the dish. 

The surprise of the night was Zoe who ordered curry duck. Lots of tender veggies and duck pieces in a mildly curried coconut milk sauce. Zoe described it as \"dazzling.\"  She left all of the veggies, which I promptly ate.   

Julie got her usual standby if pad Thai. A 5 spice level was to much for her. The peanut sauce was just right though, also with lots if fresh veggies. 

Thai Spoon has been consistently good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Place had a few people but not packed.  Two wait staff and a busy kitchen.  Waitress was horrible, had to repeatedly ask for our order, forgot our Thai tea and had to be reminded 4 times to bring it. She never checked on us.  Ordered summer rolls with shrimp and crab racoons. 5 minutes later she comes back and tells us there are no shrimp summer rolls, and asked if tofu was ok.  We agreed on the tofu.  5 minutes later she comes back to tell us there were no summer rolls at all and asks if we want anything else for an app and leaves.  Does not come  back for another 10 minutes, and when she did she brought our crab ragoons, which were cold. Shes doesn't ask about our 2nd app.  Then waited and waited for our food,about 40 minutes.  Waitress never checked on us or anything. Food came out and it was of mall food quality.  Waitress was short and sort of rude in the few interactions we had with her.  Like every thing was just a bit too much to ask.  We did order a sticky rice and custard for dessert.  It came out 10 minutes later.  The custard smelled and tasted like rotten eggs.  Strong sulfur smell.  Took a bite and gave up.  Always leave a tip, usually 20%+, to the wait staff as I understand that problems aren't usually their fault, and that tips are what you live off of in the restaurant biz, but I could not even force myself to tip this waitress, it was that bad.  Will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here and it was very delicious! I ordered the crispy tofu, the wonton soup and the chicken dumplings as an appetizer and it was all very delicious . For our main course I got the chicken pad Thai noodles with extra egg and it was great! Portions are large:) my boyfriend ordered the drunken ramen noodle with chicken and liked it a lot as well :) parking kinda sucks but oh well. The foods great :) we will def return"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai spot!!! I have tried the three major ones in Mt Lebanon / Dormont area and I loved this place ! The staff is extremely friendly- we ordered to-go but almost regretted not having the opportunity to be waited on after seeing the enjoyable way the staff interacted with their customers. The beef pad see ewe and shrimp pad Thai were awesome!!! They will bring on the spice if you ask.   Small, quaint little place tucked into a cobblestone street in the Dormont area... but so worth it! Give it a try. 

Also, order an appetizer of crab Rangoon! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I work near by and my coworkers and I share the same good taste in foods so we used to order from here a lot. 
I had everything in their lunch menu and everything is delicious, I can't tell you how happy it makes me that they have, not only tofu, but faux meat! We used to order a lot but one time I went to pick up our food they haven't even made it and ended up waiting so long that I was 1/2 hour late past my lunch break. 
My husband and I eat here when we're in the area and we both really like it. They ask how much heat you like (I'm a 5) and they really get it right. 
So, we may not be able to order out from here because of that one problematic instance but I will still eat here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Uh oh! I recently started a new job nearby and went here for the first time this past week. The menu seemed vaguely familiar, like I had already seen it somewhere else. Thai Cuisine! Aka my favorite Thai place in the city. I proceeded to order my staples that I get at Thai cuisine and lo and behold, it was the same! The sweet and spur chicken dish was perfect-not too sweet or sour and not a thick globby mess. Loved it! The tom Kha soup was a slight bit more sweet and rich than Thai cuisine, and a bit more than I would have preferred, which is why I take away a star from an otherwise 5 star review. but, for all intents and purposes, this restaurant is the same and thus a great liability for my lunchtime pocketbook. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"So good!   I ordered takeout, three dishes for 44 bucks, ready in 15 minutes on friday night. The green curry was excellent, birds nest and siam fried rice also very good.  Spice level 8 was perfect.  I'm no thai food expert, but this was delicious!"}
{"text":"After seeing the sign that this place would be opening soon, I was really excited to try it out.  I tried the spring rolls (that were really good) and the pad thai (also, a solid choice).  Overall, the food was decent Thai food, and a great addition to the neighborhood.

Also, the staff is so friendly.  I only ordered take out, but the guy who took care of my order was so friendly and nice.

I will definitely be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"YUM! We went here when we needed our Thai fix and were directed here as this was one of the better Thai places in Pitt. It was pretty delicious! Let me give you a tip: they are not afraid of spice. If you usually order hot and you ACTUALLY want it hot not, meh. hot but HOT then order it hot. However, if you want it less spicy I would go medium.

We split a pad see ew (sp?) because we were having a big dinner later and it was delicious! The snap peas were fresh, the noodles weren't soggy, and the beef was yum. We also got a Thai iced tea which, as always, was delicious.

Good little neighborhood Thai place!"}
{"text":"Did some takeout pad thai chicken & spring rolls. Nice portion. Great taste. Friendly staff. I asked for 8 outt 10 spicy & def coulda used a 9 or 10. Will surely order takeout again, and possibly eat in the cool little restaurant in Dormont."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about Thai food but my friend was in town and requested it.  So I did some searching and found this place.  I thought it was wonderful!  We went for lunch on a Saturday and took my 17 month old son.  They were nice, he enjoyed looking out the window to people watch, and my friend said it was excellent food and I agree!  I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Asian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. I've eaten a variety of dishes, but my absolute favorites are: Chicken Pad Thai and the Green Curry. I love getting them to go and enjoying them with my wife because there is enough for lunch the next day. I have been here several times over the past couple years and the quality has been great and the staff is always nice. I don't live in the area but I'm always happy to grab some great Thai here."}
{"text":"The food is always great! Have had the drunken noodle and pad Thai. Service is always very friendly."}
{"text":"This place...oh my. I have eaten there more than a dozen times and have never had a bad experience. The service is excellent and extremely friendly. The food is amazing and the prices are low.

A few highlights from Thai Spoon would be their pad Thai, corn fritters and spring rolls. I mostly get the spicy egg noodles with beef or the green curry. Both are amazing. What I really could spend all day talking about is the tom kha soup. I get tom kha at every thai restaurant I go to. While I have had a tasty bowl elsewhere, Thai Spoon has created a perfectly harmonious balance between the spicy chili paste and the creamy coconut milk. Anytime I am sick, Thai Spoon's tom kha is the only soup I care to have. Spice level 8? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Since we were on our way through Dormont, we figured we'd finally give Thai Spoon a chance. After all, the reviews were generally good. 

Unfortunately, our decent expectations were somewhat let down. We ordered edamame, crab rangoons, and summer rolls for appetizers. The edamame was...well...edamame. Not much to comment on there, and the crab rangoons were good. My wife and I were divided on the summer rolls, though. I felt that they had way too much lettuce, which took away from the basil flavor, and also made them huge for summer/fresh spring rolls. The wife liked them because of her love of lettuce. They also came with a peanut dipping sauce, which was good, but also seemed too heavy for the lightness of a summer roll. It was a juxtaposition that I'm not sure that I liked.

Neither of our meals really did anything for us. She ordered the chicken pad thai - spicy level 3 -  but definitely received a meal in the 5-7 range. She could barely eat it as she's not a spicy foods person, but tried to soldier through anyway. The flavors were decent, but no where near the best pad thai that we've had in Pittsburgh. The first thing i noticed was that but the noodles were undercooked, too...NOT a great first impression for a NOODLE dish.

I tried the spicy basil with chicken. I ordered a spice level of 5, but we're thinking they mixed up our two spice levels, as my meal was as mild as you could ever want. The flavors were good, but the most noticeable thing missing, aside from the lack of heat, was the lack of basil flavor that I love in Thai basil dishes. I essentially had a normal chicken vegetable stir fry that I could've made at home. Tastes were decent, but far from what we were hoping for.

The service was great, though, and I'm a sucker for little dive-y places, but I don't see myself traveling to Dormont to eat there again. If I'm in the area, sure, but it's hardly worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Very excited to have an excellent Thai place within walking distance of my house!  I've only been here once and I went with the Shrimp Pad Thai takeout.  It was very good.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly (not rubbery at all).  Excellent flavor to the dish and a perfect 7 on the spice level.  I will go here more than once a week!"}
{"text":"Have got take out from here twice now. The first time I would give it 3 stars, this time it was better.

I have gotten drunken noodles both times and it is pretty tasty. Not the best Thai in pgh I have ever had, but still good. I get spice level 4, which makes you sweat a little, but not be unbearable. The vegetable egg rolls are good, but please add vegetable dumplings! 

Food is always quick and fair in price. Portion size is large. My husband and I share one meal without having leftovers."}
{"text":"After moving from Bloomfield, and leaving behind my beloved Thai Cuisine, I finally found a place to get my fix. I went here with my bf and I have to say that it was pretty good.  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away.  It was a little hot due to lack of central air, but they had fans going, so that helped. There was only one server, but I was impressed on how he handled a busy restaurant.  My water glass was never empty.
Whenever I try a new place I always order Pad Thai....if they have a good Pad Thai, then they're worth my next visit. LOL.  It was good.  I got a level 8 spicey and enjoyed it.  My bf got a currie & brown rice which was pretty good.  We split and order of spring rolls.  The food came out quick and was timed very well after our spring rolls.

I enjoyed  Thai Spoon and I'm definitely going to hit it up again."}
{"text":"A tiny place in Dormont with big flavors.  If you're looking for affordable and tasty Thai food, stop by Thai Spoon.  Mmm tofu pad Thai... 

I was excited when I saw this restaurant open up in my neighborhood.  Now I'm sad that I'm so far away... UGH Thai Spoon why couldn't you move with me!?!  The flavor, the HEAT - yes they ask from 1-10 how hot would you like it... To which I reply 8.  

BYOB with a small corkage fee is always a plus.  I wouldn't recommend visiting with a large group, since the restaurant can't hold a lot of people.  If you're looking for a nice dinner for 2-4, this is a great stop.  

Now I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Service was very good. We had a great waitress. Food was good. Nice portion for entree but appetizers seemed a little skimpy for price. But they tasted great. We had taro spring roll and crispy corn fritters for appetizer.  Spicy crispy noodle at \" level three and Crispy chicken with orange sauce at level 9 spice. 
Sweet sticky rice with mango was delicious but for price serving was a little small for my taste. Nice ambiance. This is my first try at Thai food so have nothing to compare it to but I would go back there to eat."}
{"text":"Cozy little Thai place on Potomac in Dormont. I've had some very authentic meals here...and a few not so much (i think there was a change in the chef), but the food is always tasty. I also LOVE that they WILL deliver on the Thai hot scale - be warned!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to get Thai! The atmosphere is intimate but casual. The staff had always been friendly and I've never had a bad experience. It's not usually too busy during the week but it was when we went on a Saturday nice so a reservation could be helpful especially because it is small. This is also a great place to get takeout. There is parking in a lot behind the building. Prices are good as well and comparable to most very reasonable places I think. My husband and I can both eat including desserts for less than $50. Most entrees are under $10 but you get a lot of food. I always have leftovers. BYOB!

My favorite part about this place is the food though! I always get red curry because it's just my absolutely favorite anytime I get Thai food. I've tried the green curry which is also delicious. My preference is for extra vegetable and tofu but the shrimp is also cooked well. As far as apps go, I've had the summer rolls and fried tofu. Both good but would try other apps next time. The curry is what keeps me coming back! The spice scale is 1-10. 2 is almost no heat. 3 is where the heat starts I think. I like some spice but not unbearable spice so 3-4 is my pick. As far as desserts go, I love the sticky rice. It is different but if you've never had it, you should definitely try it. The banana spring rolls with ice cream were just okay in my opinion and I prefer the rice. 

I hope everyone loves this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Recommended to me by a friend, we tried it tonight and WOW! This place is awesome!! On the advice of our excellent waitress, I ordered the Gulf of Siam with an 8 level of heat (on a scale of 1 to 10). It was delicious!!!!! Waitress promised I'd love it or they'd make me something else and she'd eat it lol. Wasn't necessary. I loved it!!!!!! Shrimp lemongrass soup and crab Rangoon apps and wow what a meal!!"}
{"text":"This was my first real Thai food and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the steak with peanut sauce and tried my friend's drunken noodles.  The food was really great although I thought the sauce on the steak was a little thick.  Would go back if in the area again.  Prices were a little steep but overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We had the most impressive service at Thai Spoon. Friendly, efficient, and so gracious. The food was decent, and I absolutely appreciate the vegan/vegetarian alternatives. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ahh a good Thai place kinda close to our house! I love that this place is small. The service is great and the food is wonderful. What do I recommend? Drunken Noodles. I haven't had Drunken Noodles like this in SUCHA long time. We only tried two dishes but we will def try different ones each time we go. They have soy \"meat\" which is kinda cool because it's a good alternative to tofu. Same owners as Thai Cuisine - which I also approve of. We will def be back."}
{"text":"With the small selection of good Thai places in PGH, this is in the top 5 easily. Service sometimes is not top notch, but of the couple dozen times I've been there the poor server was only there once. Most of the time they are quick and serve delicious food. The curries are great, spicy steak (great for the price but it's not Morton's steak), all the noodle dishes (Pas Se Yew, drunken noodles, tasty  noodles), mixed veggies, summer rolls, tom yum soup w shrimp (get this every time), Larb salad (incredible), etc. Most of their menu is good food and definitely worth the taste.

They'll be on vacation in a couple of weeks for a month so be sure to give them a try before they go!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the Dormont/Brookline area after living in the east end of Pittsburgh for 5 years. I could live off of Thai food. Curry especially. I called an order for pick up and it was ready in 15 minutes. Their green curry was exceptional. Perfect amount of spice and they didn't skimp on vegetables or protein. In fact the portions were perfect. They offer brown rice which makes the dish. Also the summer roll with shrimp were really good. So pleased to have found my go-to Thai in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Look, I'm going to stop you right there.  I'm not going to compare this Thai restaurant with my favorite Thai place ever (doesn't hold a candle). I'm not even going to compare it to the best Thai I've found in Pittsburgh (different leagues). I'm just going to say for a convenient local place, it is good. They consistently do a nice job with all my favorites... Pad See Ew tofu, Pad Thai, cashew tofu. Great peanut sauce with their fried tofu yet their yellow curry is just OK. I enjoy there veggie spring rolls (although the dipping sauce is a bit twangy. Friendly staff and my to-go orders are always there waiting as promised.  I wish I could drive over to Nicki's every time I got a hankering for Thai but it's just not an option. This is a very fine local alternative."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at this restaurant.  The food is actually okay; I would have given 3 stars for food itself. My bad experience is because the owner of the restaurant started a conversation with my friend and I, and told my friend (who is Hispanic) that she should try whitening creams on her skin and what is wrong with her for not having used sunblock!!! I always thought my friend had beautiful skin, and I am offended by this talk.  No matter what your own ethnic background; it is never appropriate to tell someone they should change their skin color. I was especially embarrassed because I found this restaurant and suggested it...sigh..."}
{"text":"Great noodle dishes. The green curry is wonderful as well. Space is small and there isn't an area to wait for a table."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Pittsburgh, I was reminded that in general, the Thai food in the burgh is pretty freaking good!  Much better than what I've come across here in Denver.  I dined at Thai Spoon with a friend last week - it's her neighborhood Thai place.  This was Thai dinner #2 for the week - so instead of my normal curry, I opted for the drunken noodles.  I'm not lying when I say I ate EVERY LAST BITE.  They were so delicious.  Her green curry looked amazing as well.

The service was fast and friendly, and the prices were reasonable for pretty large portions.  I guess it's both a good thing and a bad thing this place isn't in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"So happy to have a Thai restaurant in the South Hills!  Since it's new, I'm hoping that things will smooth out and it will be my go-to for Thai food.  We ordered Pad Thai and Panang Curry, both with chicken and both at an 8 on the spice level.  The Pad Thai was not bad, with thin rice noodles perfectly prepared.  There could have been more chicken, but otherwise not bad.  The Panang Curry had the right coconut flavor, but it had pineapple in it, which was an unwelcome addition.  Neither dish came anywhere close to being spicy.  One was about a 2-3 and the other maybe a 5.  They were very busy on a Friday night but the guy at the register was very pleasant and seemed to be doing everything in the front of the restaurant while the other two staff just watched.  I will definitely go back and hope that they just keep improving."}
{"text":"Now, I am not an expert on Thai food at all. But, I like to support my neighborhood and wanted to try it out when I saw it was open. 

Went in and the boyfriend ordered Pah Thai and I had some Tom Kah soup. The soup had a nice flavor to it. The Pad Thai was very good. It tasted great and they gave you a portion big enough to make two meals out of. I think the pad thai with chicken ran about $11 so my boyfriend stated he could get the same amount for $5 in the Strip. But they are really trying here to make it a nice dine in restaurant. What used to be a closed down pizza shop for as long as I've lived here, now looks like a small restaurant with nice glasses and friendly servers. 

They have a takeout menu as well (they were out of copies when we went in) So I think I could make this a place to pick up something different for a change. Go out and support a new business and maybe someone with a better palate for Thai can describe if the food is really up to par."}
{"text":"The food is very good- but the prices have changed and my husband and I were kind of shocked to spend 29 dollars on two dishes (which is the only reason this place would get a 4). I had the Pad Thai with beef which was excellent and my husband had the spicy fried rice, also excellent. My husband loves spicy, and says that the \"8\" spicy level was great and definitely had a kick. I got my dish at a level \"2\" and it still had a tiny kick.. Which was good. If you're looking for good Thai, this is the spot.. Unless you don't have 30 dollars to spend on two dishes alone.. Then try somewhere else."}
{"text":"So I used to love this place for a short period of time. But honestly now it's been lacking in service (severely) and quality. I always had  no problem ordering a gluten free meal here. Suddenly everything changed. The lettuce wraps as I was told recently are always \"pre-made\" with a sauce I cannot have. I asked if they could do it without they said no and had a ridiculous explanation for why. Thing is,whether gluten free or not , why would I want chicken saturated in who the hell knows what for who the hell knows how long it's been sitting refrigerated in a bowl/container ? I was on the phone with one of the ladies that told me a whole story about how they have a different way and could not make my lettuce wraps gluten free. Which mind you.. is lettuce and chicken. Yes some of the sauces are not gluten free. But always had no problem here. They would be so nice as to mark my sauces on the side as to which I could use and could not. Now apparently has changed. And no cooperation for a gluten free lettuce wrap. Which is actually hilarious to me.  
I love this place otherwise the always occurring small inconsistencies. I paid for dumplings they gave me three. It's four that come in an order"}
{"text":"I've never had Thai food before but after reading the great reviews and being in the area I decided to try it.  I got drunken noodles with chicken and banana spring roll.  They were delicious and the ladies that greeted me where very kind.  I was there about a half hour after it opened for dinner so I was the only one there and I got it for take out but as I drove by on my way home later in the night I saw that they were busy.  I will be back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh for years. 

Great food, great service. Tay is / was amazing! Not sure if he is still there. 

It's delicious, nice portions and prepared to perfection. 

I really love this intimate, byob spot close to my house."}
{"text":"With no plans and a girlfriend recovering from surgery, I decided to treat my family to an Asian takeout banquet, so there was no better choice than to once again choose a nearby restaurant I haven't reviewed yet: Dormont's Thai Spoon.

Thai Toast, Seafood Bangkok, Drunken Noodles with shrimp, Thai Spring Rolls, and Thai Summer Rolls filled our dining room table. 

Man, do Summer Rolls perplex me, the non-Siamese. When I first get a look at them, they resemble pouches of diaphanous plastic wrap full of greens, noodles, and protein, that is until I remember that the weird, gummy membrane is supposed to be rice paper. These quasi-invisible egg rolls were acceptable, but the peanut dipping sauce certainly saved them from the gastronomic doldrums. However, I imagine that they're a mighty salutary appetizer sans the sauce. 

Another eccentric starter, one I know for sure I've never had before, came in the shape of triangles. Thai Toast is what it's called, and toast it definitely what it resembles. The \"combination of minced chicken and shrimp\" didn't really come through much, and once again, the sauce, this time a sweet one of saccharine chili, enlivened these crispy pieces of pan-fried bread just like the peanut sauce did for the rolls. 

The entree and dessert I had, both sublime, made up for the simply adequate appetizers, vaulting Thai Spoon into \"above average\" domain. 

I didn't get to try the Drunken Noodles or the Spring Rolls, but Seafood Bangkok, my main course, was such a subaquatic, Lenten smash, I didn't feel much of a need to have anything else. Shrimp, mussels (!), calamari (!!), fish, and baby scallops jumped into a scalding  slampit with bell peppers, basil, ginger, garlic, onion, carrots, celery, and egg only to be tossed around in a forcible, fairly fatty, flavescent gravy of Turmeric. Each oceanic morsel was supple and absorbed the South Asian spice to savorous effect. 

Dessert was yet another oddity in the Black Sticky Rice. Almost ominous and baleful to look at, the BSR merely came off as a benevolent hybrid of rice pudding and pumpkin pie. Being that this was a takeout dessert, it was not as ornately plated as it is for dine-in and required some assembly at home. The \"thai custard\" (the 'pumpkin-ish' component) came in globs placed in styrofoam with a milky coconut (?) sauce to be drizzled over it and the onyx rice, which was still warm and wrapped in foil. Once it was all put together, this strange dessert instantly made sense and was even assuaging in that its creaminess soothed my enflamed palate. 

So there you have it: an old, tired pizza joint whose name I couldn't remember for 10 grand has been transformed into a haven for what I feel is quality Thai...er Cuisine. Yes, that pun was semi-intentional as the folks behind Bloomfield's Thai Cuisine have courageously and successfully launched this second Thai restaurant in the unappreciated South Hills. Let's hope they become a fixture on Potomac Avenue."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!  What a nice addition..Potomac used to be lots of pizza (some not so good), a great bakery and one OK diner.  No longer, along with Sugar that is celebrating it's 1st anniversary, TSpoon is a welcome addition.  Yea!

The staff was really cordial.  Fun to talk to and able to answer our questions.  Found out that this is the same family as Thai Cuisine which will open soon in Bloomfield, under renovations.  

Nice little place with black table cloths under glass.

We shared the Salmon in Heaven and Green Curry with Shrimp.  Both were good.  The green curry was spiced just right with fresh veggies and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (nice and tender).  The Salmon in Heaven was a little better, again cooked just right.   The food was good, but maybe not quite as good as SBL or LBITS, Thai restaurants that are my favs. 

Will definitely return.  Welcome, Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've ever had and not even expensive. Unfortunately, every time I'm around they always seem to be closed, which is disappointing. 

I highly recommend trying the edamame as an appetizer. Everything tasted fresh and well prepared."}
{"text":"Quality of food slipping.... maybe just an off night for the chef.
Coconut based soup was more watery than usual, same for the green curry.
Lacked the depth of previously tasted soups and curries here."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I had the green curry w/ white rice. The rice was fresh & steamy and the curry was delish! Also tried the crab rangoons which were good. Quick an friendly service is key a well."}
{"text":"Thai Spoon, what can I say?  Definitely not as good as Nicky's in the North Side.  The crab rangoons were not good, no crab at all and a super sweet cream cheese in an over fried wrapper. 
I ordered green curry, I like a little spice, I ordered a 6, but could barely
Taste the heat.  The broth was watery and the vegetables were absent.  I did get a lot of bamboo shoots.  We also tried the pad Thai which
Was acceptable. Dinner for two including one appetizer, two entrees and water to drink was $29.00.  Interestingly they print a tip calculator on your bill!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this place for take away since it was nearby and I was pleasantly surprised. Honestly coming from my Orlando/Kissimmee, Florida vacay to Pittsburg I gave up on asian food from the east coast. The Viet and Thai restaurants we went to were either tasteless, over-salted, or more on the Asian/America fusion  type flavor(which isn't bad but just not the home cooking/heavy asian food I enjoy). We ordered the chicken pad kee mao (drunken noodle), chicken basil stir fry, and chicken tom kha soup. 

The chicken pad kee mao's flavor was on point! The noodle they used tasted freshly made which is oh so important in any asian noodle dish. It makes the dish 5x better. The veggies weren't overly cooked and still had a nice bite to them. I prefer having ground meat in my noodle stir-frys but they use sliced chicken. I was worried about the chicken being cut to thick like a lot of restaurants do but they slice the chicken real thin to where some pieces get broken up during the cooking process. Delish! I ordered level 7 spice and it tasted like nothing but the lady did give a side of dry pepper just in case. 

The chicken basil stir fry was good but could've been great. It has a good flavor foundation, what you would expect from thai chicken basil stir fry. If someone was newly introduce to Thai food and got this dish they would've loved it because it's not too much of a 'in your face' flavor. For me, I would've enjoyed a splash or two more of fish sauce and some more pepper. It would've been magical but
still a great dish though.

The chicken tom kha soup. It was cooked perfectly to what I know Thai food to taste like but I just wished there was a bit more of a sour taste. That's just preference though.

The steamed rice was cooked well. Not too hard but not overly cooked and left jelly like.


As for the service it was great in terms of going into the restaurant and ordering for to go. The lady at the register didn't have the most warming outward appearance and vibe but she was nice, did her job well and went above and beyond. She took my order, helped me in terms of spice levels at their restaurant(told me she would put pepper on the side and did it immediately before the food check even got to the back), and offered us water as we were waiting for the food and informed us that it was filtered since their has been 'led in water' breakout news. 

The food was quick to come out.. maybe 20ish minutes from placing the order. They don't use styrofoam containers instead they pack the food in nice, thick plastic containers that could be washed and used to pack lunch.

Great experience overall and would revisit to dine-in."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I have had lots of experience with Thai food and this is one of the better places I have ever had. Spicy Basil with beef or drunken noodles are my go to meals. I haven't had anything else yet, because I cant steer away from these amazing dishes. I have been there 6 times in less than 2 months. Only downside of this place is that it is overpriced, but excellent enough that I keep going back. I would like to see them reduce their prices a little."}
{"text":"I haven't found utterly phenomenal Thai food since moving to Pittsburgh.  Nicky's isn't bad...but it's way too overrated.  Plus, they use shrimp paste in all of their curries...so that's out.  

Found Thai spoon after watching a flick at the Hollywood and decided to try it out.  Good.  God. 

The service was excellent but honestly, I would take lousy service for great food any day.  

Come here.  Order everything.  The spice level was great, food was quick, but most importantly, it's god damned delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great in my opinion. I got the pad Thai. The server was very rude and kept muttering under her breath. Every time my girlfriend asked for something she got confused and either ignored her or brought something completely different. Not a good time :(. We told her I think five times we didn't want a bag and she kept insisting we needed one and threw it at my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while waiting for my car to be serviced. While not the most amazing thai food I've had, the food was quite solid, service was friendly, atmosphere was clean and nice, and they had a good number of vegetarian options, including several mock proteins. I'm glad this is an option in the neighborhood, because I wasn't terribly excited about the diner type of options for lunch."}
{"text":"Found Thai Spoon on the Vegan Pittsburgh website. On a Thursday evening it was only the two of us along with two other tables of diners for two waiters. Nothing on the menu was marked as vegan, so I asked the waiter for suggestions. He was eager to share that any item, including the curries, can be made vegan. I asked specifically if the 'vegetarian chicken' had egg in it (like many Morning Star products), which he assured me it was just a gluten mixture. No egg in the ingredients or coating. Ordered mixed veggies with the vegetarian chicken - that the waiter confirmed as the vegetarian chicken-ham, just like Thai Cuisine. When it arrived, both my friend's real chicken and my meal had peculiar thin square cracker-shaped pieces of protein. He tried it and said they were both dry and bland, not real chicken. Ate a little bit and when the waiter came back he was confused as to why I didn't want anything packed up and just asked for the check which said chicken. Asked him about it immediately and the waiter said, 'Oh! That's my bad!' Then he quickly flipped it and started, 'You should have said you were vegan. What do you want me to do? You need to specify the veggie chicken.' I reminded him of the two conversations that we had about me being vegan and ordering the mock chicken. He adjusted the bill, but the idea of a restaurant specifically advertising vegan-friendly options, giving a full plate of chicken is ridiculous. The two waiters were overwhelmed and frantic in the small, not busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh... my friends recommended this place to us, but the food really wasn't all that. I ordered the shrimp panang, and have had much better in the area. Service was decent, even though there was one waiter and 5 customers in the entire restaurant. The decor could use some improvement too."}
{"text":"Super friendly, fantastic variety, order spice  by number, 1-10.  The golden triangles are tasty deflated samosas, Tom Yum is perfect and curry dishes great with meat, tofu or mock meat (chicken or duck).  The drunken noodles were a huge hit.  Bonita was the best server we've ever had at a Thai restaurant and the BYOB makes this a great value"}
{"text":"This is great and this is horrible! This is great because the actual food is good. This is bad because it's RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM ME! What do I do?? How do I not go to get my Pad Thai fix every day?? These are the problems I deal with!!

Hard life, right? So this place is tiny, but it's very clean and service is quick and efficient. For a lunch special you receive soup or salad and 11 different lunch sized main dishes for $7-$8. I had the Tom Yum Veggie soup. I'd never had it before, but it was decent. Probably not something I'd seek out though rather than my go to Wonton or Sweet n' Sour Soup. It was spicy with a good amount of veggies mixed in. I was bummed to hear there wasn't a choice between other soups that day though. That's okay, still a deal in my book!

For the main dish I ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp. I know, same old, same old. But I like to first judge a Thai place by their Pad Thai. Seems logical enough! I really thought this was a stand up Pad Thai. Still doesn't beat Spice Island and their Tamarind sauce, but it was a good second choice. It wasn't dry with no sauce and it wasn't too saucy, just perfect. I also thought the shrimp was good. Couldn't really tell if it was frozen or fresh. But the good thing is, it didn't taste freezer burnt, like I have with other places (gross, I know!). 

The great and horrible thing... they do take out too!"}
{"text":"Thai Spoon makes some of the best addictive Thai cuisine in Pittsburgh or elsewhere, and is a Dormont gem that I will miss when we move away.  The food ordered, spring rolls and vegetable and tofu fried rice, is consistently delicious.  The mostly young front counter staff are friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I went into Thai Spoon with pretty high expectations.  I was referred here by a friend who said that the Pad Thai was pretty special.  I don't disagree with him in regards to the quality of the Pad Thai, however, there were a few things I did not enjoy.  My wife got the Pad Thai with tofu, as she is a vegetarian.  I've had much better tofu at other restaurants, and it was on the bland side.  My chicken pad Thai was very tasty, but it was a little sweeter than I expected.  We started off with fried vegetable dumplings, which were just so-so.  My biggest issue was with the service.  Our server was nowhere to be found for the majority of our meal, and there were only three tables active in the restaurant.  We also weren't acknowledged for at least 5 minutes upon being seated.  Overall, I would give this place another try, but would hope for better service next time. Pictures attached."}
{"text":"When Thai Cuisine was remodeling in the city, this opened. Wow. Way closer to my parent's house and so yummy. I am a stickler for Pad Thai. This one was pretty good. I would've liked more peanuts and there was no fresh cut limes (just juice). But the thai tea was fabulous as was the black sticky rice for desert. 

Between June 15-June 16, 2013, they're on vacation so I hope you don't try to come then."}
