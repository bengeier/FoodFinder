{"text":"Been here with different friends more than twice now and will be returning. Service is always great, Kevin is our favorite server! He's kind and attentive, but most importantly, he's able to help me decide on which dish I want to try :) 

Kimchi fried rice is a must try classic!
Spicy rice cakes with ramen and meats is a little bland but I can tell the flavors are there :) 
Spicy squid salad is delicious as well as the bulgogi rice! 

Get it all!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant  just open a few months ago so I decided to  try it out. OMG first time  trying  Korean  Food and let me just say it was sooooo gooooddd. Can't wait to go again. We tried the spicy pork hot stone, shrimp fried rice, Korean  ribs and oax tail soup everything  I must say was so delicious. It a must try for everyone"}
{"text":"I have only eaten Korean food twice and I love it. This restaurant was excellent. Kevin was our waiter and he was very attentive. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"First of All I will say the food was delicious!  I have lived in Korea for a few months and the food is authentic!  2nd What can I say about the portions?  HUGE!  The calamari was fabulous large and thick leg but not tough,  much better tasting than the little calamari rings you've had at the typical chain restaurant.  The makgeolli came in a large bottle and complimented our meal perfectly.  The seafood pancake was delicous and I enjoyed the tender galbi short ribs.  My only suggestion is that they serve the korean BBQ with the lettuce and bean paste."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch with my friends and the service is great. 

The food is very flavorful and similar to home cooking. 

The prices are cheap for the quality and keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm found this gem by mistake and it was pretty awesome. We had the mandoo, spicy pork belly, and spicy squid. Man it was soooooo good. The ban chan was ok. I didn't like the bean sprouts it smell like bleach.  The water tasted good. It seem filtered not like just from the tap. 

The only think I would like to change is have lettuce wraps and lunch deals other then the specials of the day. We tried to order but our server didn't really know what we were talking about. And he comes and tells out they are out of lettuce. ; (.   I will definitely be back to try more dishes.........."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is authentic, service is always on point, and food always tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Simply delicious !  The best korean restaurant in AZ.  Service was excellent! Price is very good for the food quality"}
{"text":"Seafood pancake, yes please. Mackerel dinner, absolutely. Salmon salad, duh. Kimchee, yummy. Lots of sake, thank you.  Tea is fresh. Nothing will disappoint you here."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  I don't normally try a restaurant when it is so new.  I'm glad I checked it out.  Went with some friends to check out the new asian Market. Saw this place and decided to try it out. The place is clean and modern.  The service was perfect.  The food was fantastic.   I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. We came here on a Saturday night with no plans in mind craving some really good Korean BBQ. I am from Orange County in California and have fallen in love with Korean BBQ. After yelping Korean food, this one seemed pretty good and relatively close to KBBQ so we gave it a go. It was delicious. 

Ordered the Bulgogi Beef BBQ and my friend ordered the flour noodles with chicken. We also order veggie fried rice and it was amazing. All of it had incredible flavors. Every bite I couldn't help but mention how great it was! The price isn't too much because you get what you pay for. There was plenty of left overs. The menu has lots of options for all kinds of taste pallets. 

We will definitely be returning and telling our friends about this place. This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Big, spacious, and very new looking. Tried the spicy chicken bulgogi, and mix soft tofu soup. Both were excellent! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch since it was close by the class I was attending. Wow what a great place. I had the lunch special beef short ribs. The flavor was just awesome and they serve it with a egg roll and a dumpling. They also serve you several side dishes that you can continue to order without an extra charge.  The kim chee was my favorite.  Service was good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Solid Korean spot.. not dark and sketchy like a couple of Korean spots we have beem to in Phoenix. Super friendly staff and good food with all the sides you would expect."}
{"text":"If you like tasteless Soft Tofu Soup, this is the place for you.
if you like Un-Authentic Korean food, this is the place for you.
If you want an easy intro into Korean food, this is the place for you.
For those that know Korean food, Love Korean food, Want korean food - THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU."}
{"text":"I can't really think of anything bad about this place. Food was good service was great ! Very attentive staff and clean and neat atmosphere . My fiancé and I shared the pork + potato hot pot which was very delicious . Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food selection, clean and modern environment, busy night so the service was just okay but overall it was good and I look forward to trying more dishes here."}
{"text":"I prefer gogi- better Korean food. Disappointed. No taste on side dishes or main dish. We didn't eat a lot just very disappointed on reviews. We will now on go to gogi instead of Korea town. No korean taste in any of dishes. The location was not helping - very run down shopping center where the most of shops are closed. I did't feel safe. Not worth going there."}
{"text":"Frankly, the food is good. But the service is unbelievable disappointed. First, they send our food  to the wrong table.after they figured out the food is delivered wrong, they sent the dish directly from that tables to ours with a huge bite marks on the fish. This is the most disgusting thing that I ever seen in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a terrific lunch at Koreatown today! The restaurant is spacious and very clean. Lots of seating. The service was excellent. Our server helped us navigate the menu and our lunch was absolutely delicious. My husband had Hot Stone beef bulgogi, I tried the spicy chicken hot stone. Wow! Excellent flavor and large portions. The array of pickles and small plates brought to our table before our meal was a special treat. We'll definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Always have a good time when I eat here.  Great food and great service.  We ordered a fish, Hot & Spicy Rice Cakes, Galbi, Spicy Pork Belly, and Seafood Pancake.  Every dish had huge portions, and we had to pack it to go since there was so much food.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I had some really good Korean food when I was visiting in California recently so I thought I'd look around and see what's available here in Mesa. Found this place , my husband I went there for early dinner.  Very nice simple clean restaurant, laminate table tops, not a  fancy place. Very clean, all the food was excellent, not as spicy as I would have thought or hoped. The waiter a young man, I think his name was Jen ,  answered any questions we might have had about the dishes, was attentive yet not intrusive.
 They have  beer and wine, the parking lot is kind of sketchy but I think that's going to change as the other stores start to fill up ,it seems that part of Mesa is finally  getting more populated again
Really delicious food definitely some place to try and go back to.
 It was definitely more expensive than my husband or I expected. 
I did tell the waiter that maybe they should get themselves on doordash or GrubHub LOL
One thing I might suggest is that they give better descriptions on the  menu of  the food for those who have little or no familiarity with Korean food."}
{"text":"Very good Bbg and my fav are the purple rice. Soups are so so , so do try as its huge portion and decently priced. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Rating it for Phoenix and not overall Korean food so it would be slightly higher. This should be $$$ as the galbi is like $25-30. In LA, you can get AYCE galbi for that price and you get japchae for free, not like $7-10 as an appetizer. Anyhoo, between the gf and I, we ended up sharing the pork belly appetizer, bulgogi, and seafood soon tofu. The pork belly was unique, the bulgogi was slightly sweeter than I liked but it was a generous portion and the seafood soon tofu was on point. Was craving for Asian food and this place hit the spot. Panchan can be better though. The Mekong Supermarket carries some that tastes better. Will go back even if it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced.  Never going back.  Our drinks, including water were given after the first dish placed at the edge of the table.  Enough said."}
{"text":"This looks like fun to try and I can hardly wait. Review to come

Great food and service we both have a hot stone bowl. The food came out got and remain hot all the way through the meal
The rice turned just slightly crispy 
What a wonder texture change and it really added to our food experience
We are going to return"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service!! Very clean restaurant. Highly recommended if you are interested in trying authentic Korean food!!"}
{"text":"They are absolutely amazing. I was disappointed by their servers once and rejected to go back for 6 months. But the reality is I can't find other place as good as they are. So I will take their attitude. However, since I come back, they're very nice. They can't regonize who complained for sure, which means they changed. I'm happy I could still have them on my favorite list because they're really really good."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean food, yummy sake, and a great bargain for the quality of the food. Friendly service and nice open layout."}
{"text":"Excellent had the bulgogi. (Marinated beef.) Loved it.  Husband had the spicy chicken and loved it. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"In a non descript strip mall on Broadway east of Dobson in Mesa. Blacked out windows. As soon as I opened the door I knew this was gonna be good. I was greeted with  a smiling face and order a hot stone Bi Bim Bop with spicy pork. Every bit of this was delicious. All fresh. Tons of sides too. Most I did eat some I didn't. Asked for a second side of kim chi and it was brought over immediately.
High marks from this Asian food snob."}
{"text":"The chicken bulgogi is awesome!!! They also give you several kimchi / pickled salad type items with it. Filling and tasty. We tried the chicken stew recently. It's a hot pot stewing over a small gas burner at your table. It's really good and the quantity is huge. I ate the leftovers for a couple days. Good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived for a late lunch on a Saturday.

My first impressions of this restaurant when we arrived were that it was spacious, clean and not too noisy. My husband and I were greeted promptly and warmly and shown to our table.

There was K-pop playing in the background, not too loud to be overbearing, but loud enough for us to enjoy and for my husband to sing along without being noticed ;)

Our waitress brought us our menus quickly, and she was very friendly and helpful. The menu had a lot of choice, and looked pretty delicious. My husband couldn't turn down the K-BBQ and ordered the barbequeue pork belly. I ordered the seafood tofu soup. I liked that I could choose the level of spice. I chose SPICY!

The waitress brought out a large number of side dishes for us. There was a lot of variety and they were very generous. They were delicious!

Our meals came out quite quickly, both with large bowls of steamed rice. My seafood tofu soup arrived bubbling hot with a fried fish on the side, which was cooked to perfection. Fried long enough to be crispy, but not to long as to make the flesh on the inside dry. My husband's barbequeue pork belly arrived on a hot plate and was sizzling hot. It smelled amazing!

I am glad I ordered spicy, since I do like a bit of heat. The silken tofu was smooth and delicate, and there was a lot of seafood in my soup. The broth was fiery red in color and it tasted divine! Well seasoned and flavorful.

There was so much food, that we could not finish, but our waitress offered us a container so we could take it home.

Service was fantastic. The staff is attentive, friendly and genuine and did not bother us too much.

I am definitely going to come back - there is so much on the menu I would like to try, and I would definitely have the seafood tofu soup again.

Highly recommend this place if you are after some authentic and delicious Korean food in a restaurant with great service."}
{"text":"Wow this is incredibly good!! In the area and luckily noticed the sign.. Wonderful surprise! Seafood Udon is so incredible.. the noodles are perfect, plenty sea food and perfect chili broth..  I can't wait to return with my family and friends. 
The service is outstanding too! We look forward to returning to K Town very soon."}
{"text":"The prices are pretty high compared to other Korean restaurants in my opinion. The sides are limitless and pretty good. I usually get the seafood noodle special, or tofu soup. Some days the food has tasted delicious with a perfect amount of spice added, while other days the food was too bland or sour. Really nice staff, but you'll need to get their attention every now and then. Would recommend giving this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"Spicy Korean Chirashi was a huge bowl of salmon,tuna, white fish and masago over salad greens and cucumbers topped with shredded seaweed. Chicken and spicy chicken bulgogi were both outstanding - chicken was tender and tasty. Spicy version brought a nice kick. Gotta try a couple of the hot stone dishes next time"}
{"text":"I love to explore different foods when I get a chance. Had dinner at this place a couple nights ago. I asked the waitress what are the popular dishes. She suggested this pork w/ veggie soup which came with Banchan (Korean side dishes) and Korean dumplings as a appetizer. So I ordered both. I actually liked the Korean dumplings, but that pork w/ veggie soup was not what I expected. The soup was bland and there was more vegetables than meat."}
{"text":"Great food. Worst service ever.

Dear Ms. Blonde lady
If wanna smoke, do it when all your customers are taken care of.
Don't talk to your friends for 5 mins when customers are waiting to be greeted."}
{"text":"Great tasting meats. Great service. And clean restaurant.  The only thing they need to improve on are their sides."}
{"text":"New crop of clean trendy Korean restaurants popping up throughout the country. Making me feel like a proud Korean American.
Like another reviewer mentioned It's hard to compete with K-Town LA but hey we\"re in Phoenix and this is the best we got :-) I got the kim chi tofu soup with the purple rice and barley tea. The soup was really tasty and you can tell the server how mild to hot (spicy) you'd like it. The banchans -side dishes were pretty standard. The kim chi was really fresh. Also the gongnamul 
was made spicy which I enjoyed.
The server was sweet and attentive. The food came out fast. 
Promising place! I would recommend."}
{"text":"Glad we headed out to Mesa to check this out - most modern, bright and open Korean restaurant we've ever been to.  The food (bulgogi and chicken bulgogi) was amazing and the portions were hearty.  Our server was incredibly friendly and replenished banchan dishes several times.  I was very impressed and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place was nice, clean and look and taste very authentic. They have wide variety of soups. I had kimchi pork belly soups it was a bomb. Next time we will try other kind of soups coz they all look delish."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice, the place is wide open and very clean looking. The food was delicious, kinda pricey but you get a lot! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Traveled South Korea for a few weeks last summer & this is VERY close to the real thing! Staff friendly, food good, kimchi ok, service great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place looks small from the outside but it is bigger in the inside! The food is very tasteful, my gf and I ordered 1 bulgolgi, pork fried rice, and chicken Katsu. The portions are enough to to feed two to three people. The only down fall is the prices. Overall you need to to at least try this out.


Reason why I put 4 stars instead of 5 I because all the tables smelt a little bit like bleach from when they wipe down the tables."}
{"text":"Food was great! Came here with a group of friends. Ordered seafood pancake, bbq short ribs, bbq pork bugolgi, seafood tofu soup, bugogi stone pot, and kimchi rice. 

Service was slow. They could improve on follow up with water and bringing the rice at the time of the entree. Parking was a breeze. We had some kirins as well. Overall, good experience.

Heads up- if you come with 6 or more, 18% grat is added."}
{"text":"Awesome find!!!  Everything was good. We ordered bulgogi, kalbi, kimchi pancake, jap chae and dumplings. There wasn't anything which we did not love."}
{"text":"We decided to venture away from Gogi to try Koreatown because we've heard mixed reviews from different friends so of course we got to judge it for ourselves. 

For some reason, the set up of the restaurant makes me feel like it's a cafeteria. I love the blown up pictures on the walls, makes me excited to know what's to come. 

Prices are typical for Korean food for dinner. 

Pros: 
+ they have purple rice 
+ spicy pork bulgogi was DELICIOUS! Spicy with a hint of sweetness. Can eat this all day. 
+ seafood soon tofu soup came out boiling --- LOVE my soups being hot and they gave a piece of fried fish on the side with the soup which I enjoyed a lot

Cons:
- kimchi fried rice was bland and there was no fried egg on top ): this makes me very sad! 
- seafood soon tofu soup was not soupy at all. Not sure why the soup was so thick but I didn't have any broth to eat with my rice ... 

Overall I would come back to try other things. My tumic did leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"Trying Korean food for the second time and found Koreatown with good reviews on Yelp.  

Ordered the Beef Bulgogi and chicken bulgogi.   Each came with a choice of white or purple rice.  The chicken dish came spicy as ordered but it had no real flavor.  The chicken needed to be marinated or seasoned properly.  It was nothing more than cooked chicken with a sauce on it.  Hubby said he would never order this again.  

The beef bulgogi  came with onions which added more flavor.  Therefore, this was a better dish.  But if you order this dish, get ready to tug on the meat since you will find a lot of grizzle.  What I didn't expect was to find that this beef dish would be sweet.  I particularly asked the waiter BEFORE I ordered that I didn't want anything that tasted sweet or that had seaweed.  I spoke to the waiter after I tasted the beef and he told me that the beef was probably marinated with sugar.  I guess I should have said, I don't want any sugar in any part of my dish including the marinade.  As you can guess, the beef dish was too sweet for me to enjoy.  
The purple rice which we chose instead of white rice tasted no differently than white rice.  Don't know if nutritionally it is different.  

We were served several sides dishes which included bean sprouts (good), cucumber slices (nothing special), kimchee (ok)  broccoli (Ok), sliced fish cakes (ok).  
The prices are high:  chicken 14.99 and beef 16.99 if you compare it to chinese fare.  
Service was fine and the place was clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight for the 2nd time and loved it! We're new to the area from out of state and have tried a few different Korean restaurants in AZ. We LOVE beef bulgogi as my husband has grown up with some Korean family friends and ate it a lot growing up and the bulgogi here is fantastic! I love the purple rice and soy bean paste that they have available with all the different sides - so delicious! We know we're in the right place when we walk in and there are a lot of Korean patrons at the restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the food came out fairly quick. The menu has a lot of options which is nice. We'll definitely be back and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. Only found it because the birthday human requested non-white rice bibimbap, difficult I know (my vegan self is only joking ). After calling around this restaurant said they could sub purple rice in their bibimbap. Not white rice and interesting, I was sold. I ended up ordering the veggie bibimbap with purple rice (because how can you not get purple rice) and an avocado sushi roll. I asked them to make the sushi with purple rice too, because why not. Everything tasted so good and they brought out a bunch of little pickled side dishes before the meal. Might have just been my imagination because the rice looked so pretty but I thought the purple rice tasted better. The veggie bibimbap was really good, they gave us a huge portion. One of my friends taught me to let the rice stick and burn a little instead of mixing it right away. You end up with crispy rice at the bottom of the pot. The sushi roll was massive. It was a lot of delicious food (recommend sharing the bibimbap) for a great price. Will be coming back here again, it's officially our AZ bibimbap spot."}
{"text":"I like Koreatown because me and friend go here a lot.  The food is good and the place is nice and clean.  This place get really busy now compare to when it was first open.  The service still stay the same, great as alway.  They are really friendly and alway come to the table one in while to check if you need anything else.  Come here if you like Korea food."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice now. I have heard mixed reviews from this place...a coworker loves it and some of my family don't like it much. I usually go to Hodori, but this place I found is a pretty good alternate. The sides are great and the jap chae is delicious. The galbi is pretty expensive at 23.99 but good. We got bulgogi today for $18.99. It was very flavorful maybe even slightly too sweet. I wish it was a bit more burnt instead of soupy but it's pretty good! Both times, the place was pretty empty when we went so there was barely any wait. The service was pretty good too. Will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"I have not had Korean food before but the food we had at Koreatown was amazing, and paired with the service, it was definitely a 5-star experience! My fiancé & I had gotten here at 7:30p on Saturday night. There was no wait time, but most of the tables around us were full. We were greeted immediately, seated, and given a chance to look over the menu. Our server came by and asked if we had ever been to Koreatown. After we let him know that we had not and that we had actually never had Korean food either, he gave us a quick run-down of the menu.

I had seen multiple photos from my Yelp friends of the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi so I ordered that and upon inquiring if it was very spicy our server suggested getting it medium-spicy, so I agreed. My fiancé got the Bulgogi Hot Stone per recommendation of our server.

The small dishes that we were given to try out while we waited were very interesting. I didn't realize all the items were served cold but they included kimchi, pickled radishes, zucchini, sprouts, fish cakes, broccoli, potatoes, and squid. I liked the kimchi, zucchini, and sprouts, the other items were also okay.

When our food was delivered to us, both of the dishes were sizzling and smelled phenomenal! The Chicken Bulgogi dish quickly became one of my favorites after only a couple of bites! The sauce had a very unique flavor and tasted great in combination with the caramelized onions and the side of rice. I think that medium spice was perfect for me just because I don't eat super spicy food, but I could myself enjoying it with the normal amount of spice as well just because the sauce seemed a bit on the sweeter side. The hot stone was different in that the rice was served on the bottom (instead of on the side) with meat, veggies, and an egg on top, but sauce on the side. Our server told my fiancé that he would recommend adding as much sauce as he wanted into the pot, mixing the contents together, and waiting just a couple of minutes so that the heat from the stone would complete cooking the egg. My fiancé really enjoyed his dish as well and commented that in this case, more sauce was better.

The portion size of the Korean BBQ was big enough for two to share, but we liked trying two dishes out and taking some leftovers home. If I had to make a recommendation, I would probably suggest getting the Korean BBQ style over the hot stone only because the stone was so hot that it kept cooking the items. The flavors were so good in both however, that it really is personal preference.

Our server, as previously mentioned, was really helpful and came by to ask if we we needed anything a couple of times. He was prompt in taking our order, bringing us the check, and so forth, as well. Definitely a 5-star place in my book, I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, definitely not the best Korean food in the area though. I like the spicy pork bulgogi but their service that day was horrendous. We asked the guy that was working if we could get some water, rice, and more side dishes...15 minutes later and still nothing. We waved at a few waitress' and the waiter and no one looked until we had to walk up to one waitress that was very accommodating. It seems like there's only one person that knows what they're doing at this restaurant in terms of customer service."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken bulgogi is awesome. The mushroom/bulgogi hot pot was okay but I would definitely stick to the specialty dishes . Coming back!"}
{"text":"Their spicy level is not at all spicy to me. Good Korean foods. Atmosphere was clean with plenty of parking. Good customer service. Although I prefer a little more kick to the spice level. But overall it was good. I like their small dish condiments. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent, huge portions, very flavorful and the wait staff was very pleasant. We left with full bellies and tons of leftovers."}
{"text":"After several visits here I can definitely say this is my go-to for Korean food! Everything I've had so far has been spot on and delicious. 

Appetizer:
Soft shell crab: serving portion was perfect $7.99

Hot stone:
Bugolgi (marinated beef) was so tasty like usual with sliced carrots, daikon (white carrot) cucumber, bean sprouts, greens, onions and rice and a fried served on top served in the hot stone bowl. A nice staple dish with all the food groups! :) 2 people can share this as well. $13.99. 

Soft Tofu Soup:
kimchee - silky soft tofu, kimch, bulgolgi swimming in the mild Red Sea while the egg cooks in the boiling bowl. Let this sit for a little until the bubble subsides. Munch on the mackerel fish while waiting. Soothing soup for he stomach assuming you choose mild. $10.99

Noodles:
Soy sauce soba noodles - cold noodle soup served in a large bowl with daikon, carrots, green onions, boiled egg, sprinkled seaweed and ice to keep the noodles cold! $10.99
Seafood Flour Noodle soup-  served with mussels, squid, shrimp, scallops, ridged carrots and zucchini and green onion  $12.99. 

Special entree:
Pork belly lettuce wraps- comes with steamed soft pork belly,  napa cabbage, slices of garlic and jalapeño, Korean spiced daikon sliced 2 ways for an added crunchiness and Korean sauce (shrimp and soy bean paste) $16.99

Korean bbq:
Bulgolgi - the popular of the bbq section is the marinated beef with sautéed sizzling onions and sprinkle sesame seeds.  Great for sharing! $16.99

Korean alcohol:
Makgeolli - milky rice wine $7.00

Service is wonderful with cheerful servers and they actually keep track of who came in first. Food is delicious and worth going back several times. Big and spacious area. Tvs are available if you're needing to watch a particular game."}
{"text":"Came here because of the many good reviews. I'm from Minnesota, and my experiences with Korean food are not great---but I know when the food is good. Here, I am not feeling it as much. 

I ordered the spicy stir fried squid and the brazen salmon---salmon came out first. It tasted okay, but can taste a lot of burnt ingredients, but it was edible. The stir fried spicy squid came out sizzling in a hot plate almost choking me with the pepper aroma. It tasted like a jar of Korean pepper paste with some sugar, that was what I tasted. It was very hard for me to finish my meal---so I guess I will never come here again (really yummy Korean food I find best in MN is Dong Yang--located inside the grocery store---fresh and very flavorful without the out of the jar taste). 

My experience inside the restaurant, I was seated immediately. I was the second table and ordered my dish before table 3 and table four, but got my food last. Not cool."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix to visit a friend and wanted to eat some authentic korean food. From my past experience, I haven't had great korean food in Arizona. But I came across this restaurant and was shocked with how great it was. Not only was the restaurant very spacious and clean, it had a good menu, nice employees, and of course tasty food. Very well made!! I would definitely recommend to others and will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Koreatown opened today and I had the pleasure of having lunch here. Had the soy sauce soba, soooo good. This restaurant is beautiful and the dish looked just as pretty too. The banchan are really good. I'll give an updated review once they're open a little longer!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place with flavorful menu. I am not sure it is authentic since I am not Korean. I wish they use more chicken breast than thigh meat."}
{"text":"Koreatown is the hottest new restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. I've eaten here twice and I find it to be top notch authentic Korean food. Kee (Ron) and Diane Hong are not new to the restaurant industry. And they keep putting up these great eateries. 

Last time we got the Bulgogi, Calamari and Seafood soup. Kee knows Bulgogi! Kee in known for his masterful interpretation of Korean Bulgogi and nailed it here. (Try the Bulgogi here) OMG!!
Tender Calamari and the Seafood soup is spot on.

Today we tried the Softshell crab (A big plus!) and the Spicy Pork Belly, served with beautiful lettuce leafs to wrap with. All the condiments are authentic and bright and flavorful.
Clearly I could go on and on!

Of course each meal starts with 8 classic Korean amuse bouche.

Wonderful food!!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Very friendly. Super busy at dinner time.  The huge hot pots are the best.  Army Hot Pot is chock full of sea creatures, veggies, chewy thick noodles and dumplings.  The broth in the Mushroom Bulgogi Hot Pot is so rich and sweet and full of umami.  Plentiful hunks of meat and mushrooms of every sort"}
{"text":"This super modern place has the best in Korean dishes from monster sized hotpots for 4 to humongous, pancakes, egg casseroles, barbecued meats, sushi, tofu pots and soups and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been to Koreatown for dinner 3 times now and each time has had great food. First off, the dining area is huge. It can easily fit larger groups. Second, I love the bonchon (small appetizers) that they offer complimentary. This also means free refills! My favorite however are the entrees. I personally love the seafood tofu soup (comes with scallops, mussel, tofu, shrimp) and would recommend that. It is about $10. I would also recommend the bbq meats, especially the pork bulgogi. It comes out spicy and is amazing. Although the normal beef bulgogi is available, it is not very memorable. 

The only reason I knocked it down a star was that the servers were not very attentive. My table's water was not refilled until the check was given. We also had to go up to the counter and ask for our own to go boxes since no one was walking around our area. However, I would still recommend Koreatown because it is one of the best Korean places around."}
{"text":"Whoa! This place rocks! Great service, great food! I had the Hot Stone Bulgogi and the Seafood Soft Tofu Soup. I'd never had the soup and was BLOWN AWAY by it. The Hot Stone was the best I've ever had. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service.  The lunch special was affordable and a great value.  Ambiance was top notch compared to other local offerings."}
{"text":"This place is great, I just left and I already can't wait to come back. The food is spot on, and the service is quick and and very nice. April was my server and did a great job, I got my food very quickly, while juggling two other tables and a 24 top! Will be coming here again for sure."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Koreatown. The restaurant was easy to find with easy access to free parking. The interior was very modern with high ceilings. I knew this place was going to be good because the menu was translated into Korean.

We went on a Tuesday evening and it was relatively busy. I went with 18 people and we were all able to sit together at our reserved time. The waitress was very attentive and speedy. She did a phenomenal job taking everyone's orders and not screwing a single one up! Props! 

Note that Korean restaurants usually bring out the appetizer with the main course, or at least this has been my previous experience with Korean restaurants. They brought out the small complimentary appetizers with the meals, including the bean sprouts, fish cakes, squid, cucumbers, fried fish, and etc. Additionally, I had ordered a seafood pancake for a large appetizer, which also came with the meals. The seafood pancake comes on a large plate, cut into 8 pieces. On the side, they have the seafood pancake \"very salty\" sauce. Some people liked the sauce, others thought the seafood pancake was better without the sauce. 

Under Korean BBQ, I had the pork bulgogi. This comes with a side of white sticky rice. It was spicier than my liking but still pretty good. Otherwise, this dish was delicious and was well presented on the sizzling plate. Pro tip #1: don't touch the metal part of the sizzling plate - it's hotttt. Pro tip #2: If you try anything bulgogi, ask for a side of lettuce. It's usually complementary. I like to wrap the pork and rice in the lettuce. 

Needless to say, I had plenty of leftovers (enough for two meals). Korean meals are generally pricey in nature and this place was no different. I would love to go back and try some of their hot stones dishes."}
{"text":"The customer service here is very good. The waiters and waitresses are all very nice!! I ordered Seafood Flour noodles and it comes with 8 Korean side dishes. All very delicious. I recommend K-town!!"}
{"text":"Korean food is something that is new on my radar and this place just happens to be right down the street from work. They were happy to help me select what to order and checked on me several times to make sure everything was fine during my visit. YES!

Inside is very clean and there are plenty of tables for those hungry appetites. The decorations are pleasant with some nice modern touchs. They even have a couple of TV's to zombie out on while you're eating your meal.

Ordered the Chicken Bulgogi and had them make it extra spicy. This was my first attempt at this type of dish and it came with a side of Purple Rice. It was very good and the portion was rather large. The sauce was a little on the sweet side. Maybe this is normal. This is a dish the you could easily share with someone special.

Went with the Hot Stone Beef Bulgogi on my next visit and fell in LOVE. It arrived at the table still cooking in a very hot bowl and the sounds and smells were most excellent. They give you some type of red sauce in plastic bottle to squeeze on the top and it really took the dish to the next level.

Their colorful menu is packed with several types of appetizers and entrees. They even serve a good selection of alcoholic beverages for those who wish to partake and get crazy. They also have many yummy non-alcoholic beverage for those who are driving or just do not wish to get sloshed.

Located in the new Asian complex on the NE corner of Broadway and Dobson. Look for me here around lunchtime right when they open. Can't wait to try out some of their Pork Belly dishes and maybe even splurge on some killer Seafood. ORDER UP!

4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"The meal starts off with little sides of vegetables, very tasty.  Had the Galbi hot pot, it was yummy.  The pot makes the rice crunchy, which is the best part.  The Galbi was very tasty and flavorful.  My husband had the bulgogi, that was very tasty too.  My son had the Army hotpot for 2.  We had never had that before.  It was spicy, just the way my son likes it."}
{"text":"Very clean, very good service, very good food. Very happy with everything including canned cokes. The soft shell crab was best I ever had. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Solid joint! Not a BBQ place, but excellent Korean food. We had the octopus salad, bulgogi stone bowl and spicy brisket soup.  The soup was a bit salty, but apart from that it was great. Banchan was plentiful and well done."}
{"text":"Thumbs down. Just wasted 25 minutes waiting for someone to come over and seat us or even acknowledge us. One couple called the takeout line to tell them their waiting area was full and even then no one came over to acknowledge any of their waiting customers for some time. We didn't expect that the service would improve so we are now on our way to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Very delicous Korean food! Reminds me of when I visited Korea. Love their little sides of KimChi as well."}
{"text":"Another one of our go to restaurants, this place has been pretty consistent with their food. We have tried many kbbq in the area and we have noticed that the quality in food goes down after awhile.  So we are hoping the same doesn't happen here. It isn't like other kbbq in the sense of they do not have any cooktops inside the tables.  Instead they do all their cooking in the kitchen.  Unfortunately if they placed this is Korea Town this would probably be a 2 maybe 3 but Arizona kbbq is hard to come by and so far this is one of the better ones so I would give it 3.5 if they had decimal ratings."}
{"text":"Great food. Don't get the crab appetizer = not worth it. Everything else pretty good."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here as he was craving Korean food. I had only ever had it once and it's been so long I didn't remember it. Anyway, Koreatown had amazing food! I let him do the ordering and I was defintely not disappointed. We had the Hot and Spicy Rice Cake and the Korean Dumpling. And iced Barley Tea to drink. Not a single complaint about any of it. Pricing for the amount of food you get is great as well. Also, the service was awesome. The waiter was great about checking up on us to make sure everything was good and we always had what we needed. I will defintely be back."}
{"text":"This place is one of the most disappointing Korean restaurants I ever been to. You can tell if the food will be good or bad based on their side dishes. Koreans love their side dishes, so when the s/d is disappointing, you can bet the food will be too. 

My fiancé ordered beef fried rice and I ordered the ox bone soup. It was disappointing. The portions were so much, they even failed to get the correct texture and the taste of the foods. Quantity wins over quality at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Two words: beef bulgogi.  Oh my gosh.  It's addicting.  We get it everytime we come to this restaurant.  The meat is so tender, and the sauce/marinade is so tasty.  We also pair it with one of the fried rice dishes, which are always great.  Service is fast and good.  Highly recommend this restaurant for great Korean food!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Korean food with nice service.  We had the Korean dumplings, spicy chicken bulgogi, and beef bulgogi hot stone and all of them were fantastic.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.  Can't wait to sample more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service.  This time we tried the pork dumpling hot pot.  The soup base was delicious.  I have never see any hot pot come with so many dumplings.  This dish is meant for a party of 2 but it could definitely feed a party of 4.  Me and boy friend like trying different dishes when we go here.  He gets purple rice and get white rice.  Definitely would recommend everyone to go and check this place out.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good authentic Korean food with slight American twist, this is the place to go~~!! Huge selections, great banchans(side dishes), great service. It's worth it to check it out."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday at 2pm. Ordered bulgogi bbq, pork fried rice, Korean dumpling soup, tempura appetizer, calamari. Everything was fresh and hot and our order was completely correct. Service was fast and the restaurant was very clean. I am not a fan of Asian food in general but my family out numbers me, this food was good and I would come back here again when the family wants Korean."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of Vietnamese and Chinese eateries in this part of Mesa but other Asian cuisines are under-represented; so it's good to know that a sizable Korean restaurant is found here as well. I was relieved to find that the service here is relatively fast, considering that a previous visit to another Korean restaurant made us almost wilt from the wait for food. I enjoyed their bubbling-hot seafood tofu soup - it was comparable to the great tofu soups I enjoyed in the Korean areas of NYC and northern NJ. The hot stone seafood dish I ordered on another visit was decent, if a bit on the bland side. Banchan or side dishes came with each meal and were flavorful and adequate. The restaurant is conveniently located at the eastern end of the commercial complex on the northeast corner of Dobson and Broadway. Though the commercial complex is huge, it is not busy so parking is never a problem. The restaurant is clean, well-lit and very spacious. That latter aspect made me wonder why, during a quiet mid-afternoon, the server had me seated next to a table where a couple faced me at an uncomfortably close distance, making us awkwardly try to avoid staring at each other in the middle of a big dining space which was nearly empty at that time. If privacy and personal space are important to you, let your server know you would like to be seated accordingly."}
{"text":"Ok. I love Korean food. Spicy and flavorful. So, I brought my whole family here and there is plenty of room. It was a billion degrees hot outside but inside super cool and comfortable. Seated right way with super friendly staff. 

We ordered a ton of food. 

Army Noodle Soup, which the menu says is good for 2 but really it's good for 4. Huge and cooked/heated on the table the way it's supposed to be. 

Pork belly bulgogi with squid was super delicious and generous portion. 

Hot stone beef bulgogi was super piping hot with an egg on top! So yum. 

Beef fried rice was huge and very yummy. Nice texture and flavor. 

The banchan are good. The kimchi is homemade on site and is very good. Not too sour but fresh tasting   

The atmosphere is nice. The place is clean. Food tastes clean and homemade. 

I did not get a chance to sample soju but I will I. The future. Good soju goes so well with Korean food 

Really the only complaint is soft drinks are not unlimited. Or are they? I was given a super ambiguous response. So I don't know. 

Now, they don't serve jjajamyeon or jampyong. But that's ok. 

It's a fairly diverse menu with some nice soups and noodle soups. 

I will be back. I like good Korean food.  

It is more expensive than cheap fast food. But it is a nice sit down and eat lots of Korean food restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my! So impressed with this restaurant. The servings and size were great. It's $17 for the bulgogi, which my bf and I shared with extra rice. Our tab was only $21. Their green tea was okay but I'm loving this place so much. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I used to always complained with that there are not enough good Korean restaurants in Phoenix. Well, this one was great! I had a Kimchi Sundubu, which was very good and tasty. We also ordered steamed egg, which was much bigger than I expected. 
Will definitely be back next time I go to Mesa."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and beautiful food! The banchan was tasty and the tofu soup as well. This place just opened today and I know I'll be coming often!"}
{"text":"Good food, great environment. Checked the place out and was thoroughly satisfied with how delicious the food is. I ordered a Spicy Pork Bibimbap. A little too much sauce but tasty. My girlfriend ordered Ox Tail Soup. Ox tail was tender and the soup hit the spot for an empty stomach. The place has a hip, Korea Town environment. Service was a little slow even being two of the few people there at the time.

Overall, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went into the restaurant doing a basic yelp search and looking at the pictures. 

Exterior: It is located in an international market area with several stores and restaurants catering to the Asian community. From the outside, the restaurant looks very dark because the windows are covered.

Interior: From the inside, the windows are covered with a film because the restaurant faces west. There is a lot of space so large groups are welcome and I saw several while I was there. Very clean from the moment I entered.

Staff: Wonderful. I had never had Korean food before and the wait staff walked my table through options and made suggestions. They also gave us warning on a dish that was cold as some guests has previously thought it would be hot (noodle dish). Such good service.

Food: I went specifically to try the hot stone soup because it was a featured dish on the Master Chef show. I had the spicy pork and it was very good. Also had the potato noodles and the Korean dumplings. I would eat all of these again. I also saw several other dishes I would try again.

The fact that native Asians ate here and the fact that I overheard a few other tables talking about when they had previously gone, I am definitely wanting to eat here again and show it to others.

Go with friends and split several dishes. Such a great experience."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Korean restaurant has just opened in Mesa. I didn't even know about this place until my friends mentioned it. I called in to check if they were open, but no one answered so I played a fortune by driving all the way from Gilbert to Tempe to check this place out.

The restaurant is located in the International Marketplace Plaza, and it may be difficult to point it out correctly if you have never been there. Once I got in, got seated briefly by staff. We were offered drinks right away even though the restaurant was kinda packed at the time.

So far, I have tried some mandatory Korean dishes like Kalbi and Bulgogi, and all I can say is they were prepared nicely. Bulgogi is very soft with full of flavors, Kalbi is a little too fat, but still eatable. You should try the purple rice that goes along with entree. Squid salad is also another must try, and the tofu soup is very delicious (lots of soft tofu and not too salty). The gal who served us was also friendly and attentive. She checks on our table every 15mins to make surr we got what we needed. I think I have found my new favorite Korean place in town."}
{"text":"I have been to KoreaTown several times when It first opened. I would have rated it 5 stars back then except for the two most recent visits. The portions were less. I ordered the rice cake dumplings a few times and could never finished it. However, now I was able to finish it! I was not starving at that time tbh. The second time I had this bone soup. I ordered the beef brisket soup and it was tiny. The soup back then was large. Still, I would visit it due to it is better than many of the Korean restaurants around town"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm Korean and my hubby is not.
Pretty sure I know authentic korean food. Saw this as a hot new restaurant on yelp and had to try it out as my first korean food experience in Arizona.
Saw a picture that a fellow yelper had posted showing they had Poke bowls as a special. Hubby loves poke bowls and not so much love for korean food.
We drove over and when we walked in, we were greeted by a smiling young server named Eric. Nice guy who sat us and even apologized that they were out of diet Pepsi and offered diet coke which was fine for hubby.
I ordered the kimchee stew with pork belly which is my all time favorite comfort food dish. Hubby found out that they didn't have poke bowls today so Eric and I convinced him that the spicy chirashi bowl would be a great substitution. 
Found out Eric was Chinese and not korean.  When my pot came out, I realized it was soon tofu soup with kimchee instead of kimchee stew. I had ordered it by the korean name and he didn't understand it. He took it back right away and apologized. A nice lady came out and also apologized for the mix up. I felt bad but I'm not a fan of tofu soup. I was apologizing for not being clearer in my ordering. Hubby's chirashi came out and it was great with flavor and lots of fish. There were 8 banchan dishes of tempura, cucumber kimchee, kimchee, salty fish, broccoli, zucchini and a couple others. Nice variety but I love when they have egg and potatoes and dark on kimchee. 
My kimchee stew came out and it was wonderful.
Huge restaurant that's very clean, has tvs and a peekaboo kitchen. Huge bar offering which Koreans love. Great menu that has a bit of everything.
Good pricing.
Kimchee stew: $9.99
Spicy chirashi: $12.99

Thanks for great customer service and good clean food.
Hoping someone ate that kimchee tofu the!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great services!! This place is amazing. To save you some time order the beef bulgogi and have some fun!!"}
{"text":"So moving from SoCal, I missed my AYCE Korean BBQ places, or even just the tofu houses that were in abundance over there, to my pleasant surprise, Koreatown just opened by the International Market by my house- and boy am I happy about it!

The food here is delicious. The hot stone pots with bulgogi, seafood ( or your choice of meat) is a safe and delicious bet for anyone. I also got the tofu soup with maximum spiciness and it was AMAZING. The flavor of the broth is on-freaking-point here. All the Korean bbq plates are great too. You'll get it on a sizzling cast iron plate whether it is galbi, bulgogi, chicken bulgogi ( they cost about $14-$20)

They also have daily specials, like cheese kimchi pancakes, or combo meat yakisoba and they are always good price ( $8.99-$15.99) and although some might say that's pricey- it's not when you consider it can often serve two and you get all the traditional Korean sides like kimchi, seaweed salad, potato salad etc). 

I also recommend that you do not pass up on the pork belly lettuce wraps. It's about $16 and is not only perfect if you are trying to keep it low-carb, but is a great filling appetizer, or meal for 2-3 people. It comes with 2 types of kimchi ( one is sweeter, and the other more of a pickled vinegary style)

Also, you can get $5 sake bombs with your choice of bomber at this place- that's a steal too! And perfect to go with your spicy tofu soup, galbi plate, or pretty much anything!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is authentic and the side dishes are legit. It is never crowded and so the place welcomes us with a comfortable atmosphere every time. 

My favorite dish is the hot stone galbi. Plenty of veggies and crispy rice make for a great meal. I also appreciate our food served in a timely manner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here because high rate for Yelp reviews, but I was disappointed. Food was not good. The noodle we oldered was so sweet. ( forgot the name) Two waiters seemed not happy to work. No smile! No Say Hi when you walked in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't get the sound of the sizzle and incredible aroma from the burning hot plate of spicy chicken bulgogi out of my mind! I'll share more on that later, but first let me share some tidbits about dining at Koreatown.

The restuarant is located in a very indistinct strip mall that has been mostly empty until recently (I saw a new pho shop and food market in the same complex). There is a private parking lot and plenty of parking, however I didn't notice bike parking near the restuarant itself.

The interior is casual and clean, with lots of photos of what the dishes look like throughout the restaurant. There was plenty of seating to accomodate a large group or smaller tables for a couple to enjoy dinner. Sound carried pretty well here and there TVs with sports on, so know that it is not a fancy establishment.

The staff was very polite and helpful. They are very proud of the food they serve and were very informative in thier description of the dishes and category of dishes. I was greated immediately upon entering and seated promptly. My waiter offered to help with suggestions and knew a lot about the dishes offered. I decided to go with the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, which was served on a platter which sizzled at my table for a bit while I was busy digging in. The chunck of chicken were small enough to easily be picked up with chop sticks yet not get dried up due to the hot plate. It was a very savory sauce that was a bit sweet and very very spicy. While the level of heat was high, the taste really stood out as the chicken was flavorful and juicy. It came with 5 small sides including a marinated eggplant side, cucumber, beansprouts with spicy condiments, kimchee and one more I cannot remember. It also came with a serving of purple rice that was sticy and flavoful. The waiter explained that it is cooked with a type of bean that gives the rice its purple color. I was glad he suggested I try it instead of plain rice. Note you are given only chop sticks here--I can eat with them so I didn't ask for a fork and I am not sure if the do or don't have forks.

I was offered additional sides and asked for some kimchee to go. They brought over a box (one order at $14.99 can easily feed 2) and I took some leftovers for my hubby to enjoy. They gave me a whole small container of the kimchee and I wasn't charged for it so I left a hefty tip. I saw the Bimbimbap and several of the soups come out and they smelled and looked GREAT. I will definitely be back and I will be sure to bring my friends with me.

A shout out to Mark R. who suggested this location. Your review was spot on!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's been great every time. It's in the new Mekong international market plaza so there's plenty of parking and easy to get to from the 101. The staff is always friendly and quick to refill the ban chan when we ask. All of the sizzling plate meats were great but my favorite thing I've gotten so far is the neck bone hot pot. Definitely my go to Korean spot now."}
{"text":"Food was great, service? Could've been improved. Came here to meet up with friends, and tasted their mackerel fish dish and Pork belly dish. Ooolala heaven in my tummy. So flavorful and hit the Jackpot. Will definitely going back but I feel like the waitress needs to going around more often to check on their customers. If you have a craving for Korean food, this one shouldn't be skip."}
{"text":"If I can give a zero star I would.....
My friend and me had dinner here and we had the worssssssttttt diarrhea ever. 

It was so bad... I'm not even exaggerating it.... 

So sad we like the food but I guess it s not worth it to have another diarrhea"}
{"text":"Out of all the Korean restaurants I've been to, Koreatown is the most cleanest, modern built, spacious restaurant I've seen and been to out of the whole valley.   

-Food-
Soon Dae Gook (blood sausage): The broth was refreshing and if you add a little extra gochujang (red chili paste), it'll taste even better. 
Galbi tang: One of my favorites. broth is good and comes in a large silver bowl. I can't even finish it.  
Boo Dae Jigae (army soup): I like spam, sausage, rice cake, with ramen noodles. It's a large size hot pot so make sure you have a party of three or more to finish the pot. 
Dae ji bulgogi (spicy pork): Really good! Must have! The meats are cut to good size portions with a slight kick to it. 
Bulgogi:  Has flavor to it, it doesn't have a dull taste to it. 
Soju: Pretty good selection. The flavor soju's are good but they have a slightly lower alcohol content. I believe it's around 13%. I'll stick to chamisul (+20%). Can't forget about Somek (soju + hite = 1 shot) 

Waitresses and Waiters are super friendly. Seahawks were playing a game on a Sunday, the waiter was able to put the game on for us. 

I will return to try their other selections of food : )"}
{"text":"We visited as family this weekend, the place was not crowded and the service was excellent! Easy to get a parking space, the place is clean, the staff very friendly, and we really enjoyed our food. Specially I did with the Salmon and the Octopus salad :) 
We will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"For someone who isn't a huge Korean food person, this place wasn't to bad. The place is located in a dead zone plaza and from the outside it looks small. But once you get inside its actually really big. I went on a Tuesday night and I was really surprised that it was busy. I saw a lot of families like eating here. I ordered the spicy pork belly and my boyfriend ordered the Korean fried chicken. For dinner time if you order off the Korean BBQ menu they give you the side dishes that come with it. The food was okay. I tried some of the chicken from my boyfriend it was not to bad either. It had like a sweet taste when you ate it. I also like have they gave you French fries. The waitress was very nice. She made she to explain what was in the food. This is place of more of a one time thing for my preference."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The place is filled with great food, an amazing atmosphere, and some of the TVs are playing K-Pop (HUGE win for me!) I ordered dumplings, spicy pork hot stone, bulgogi, and chicken fried rice. Everything was delicious! I would come here again with more friends. I had a great time."}
{"text":"Went here cause it was new, wanted to check out the new Asian market and try this place. I got jjigae which they put an egg in without me asking. At Hodori I got lip for asking for an egg in my jjigae. Overall good food but the menu is odd english or korean alphabet. I don't read korean well enough to read just the Korean but the english was odd enough that I had to ask if the soup was jjigae. Waitress also didn't ask how spicy I wanted it or what rice I wanted. I didn't notice until they brought it out. The jjigae was mild, not even close to hot. And I was really excited for purple rice and had to settle with white. But overall it was good and we'll be back, probably with uber to drink it up."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some delicious Korean food, and were on our way to Scottsdale from our starting point this evening, which was in Gilbert. 

In particular, I wanted some Korean BBQ, and I was salivating at the possibility of enjoying such a wonderful delicacy.

My sense of anticipation was delayed by the accident that occurred on the 60 just before we got to the 101 interchange. I would have to wait a little longer before I could enjoy this evening's dining experience.

Wait? Me? 

I immediately cut through the slowing traffic, and made for an exit that would take me through downtown Mesa, and allow me to take the 202 as an alternate route to our ultimate destination.

As we sat at the stoplight by Dobson and Broadway, my wife eyes this particular restaurant called Koreatown. 

What a treat! A new place to try, and I don't even have to experience the aggravation of wading through traffic. 

When we arrived and entered into this restaurant, we immediately noticed the great amount of patrons dining here. This heightened our expectation due to the fact that an establishment with this kind of draw on a weeknight can't be all that bad! 

As we perused the menu, we were presented with a plethora of delectable dishes that we wanted to try. 

Self-control definitely went out the door, and we ordered a myriad of dishes. Our reasoning being that we would have plenty of left overs. (Note: This never works, as we always have left overs, and we nearly always throw them all away!)

We definitely wanted to try their Sizzling Beef Bulgogi, Korean Dumplings, Mixed Tempura, and the Fried Rice. Along with the Banchan, this made for a copious amount of dishes to try in one sitting - especially, for just two people.

The Sizzling Beef Bulgogi's aroma, and delicate flavor was simply outstanding. The Korean Dumplings, Mixed Tempura, Fried Rice, and the Banchan made for wonderful accouterments to this splendid meal. 

If you happen to be around this area, and are in the mood for some amazing Korean cuisine, this is a great place to satisfy your wanting palate!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, the service was good too. Galbi combo w/ Nengmyun was delicious. I thin the Galbi was 5/5 and the nengmyun was 4/5, fairly basic."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but this place deserves one.  Husband and I love Korean food but we are always turned off by the bad service in other restaurants.  We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the servers were here.  One time, they made a mistake (which really could have been my fault too) but they offered us a free dessert.  You don't see this often in other asian restaurants.  Anyhow, aside from the service, the food is phenomenal.  We go here just about every other week.  They also have a lot of seating so it's great for large parties, which we have often.  They also have a lot on their menu to choose from and we haven't been disappointed with anything we tried.  My favorite plate so far is the spicy pork belly, bbq chicken, and kimchi fried rice.  This is our new favorite restaurant.  Highly recommend it to everyone.  But please don't all go at once because I don't want to have to wait in line :)"}
{"text":"The first time my spouse and I went, we ordered two dishes and it was good.  The second time we went we got two dishes and were disappointed. Jap chae had no vegetables in it and another soup dish was  not good and they ran out of purple rice.  We decided to try it again and the third time we went, we ordered the seafood tofu soup.  When the waitress arrived, she brought us a small dish of fried fish (where did that come from?) and a kiddie bowl of soup with tofu.  I looked at it and thought that's not what we ordered. She simply smiled and walked away.  For the prices we paid, the lack of information (waitress simply nodded pretending she understood when she did not), we're not going back."}
{"text":"I expect this place to be a big success. Very nice, spacious restaurant with excellent decor. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Food and presentation is top notch. Side dishes we better than I've had at other Korean restaurants and they refilled them for me graciously throughout my meal. 

It will be fun to watch this hard working group grow as word gets out about this place. 

Best wishes and good luck!"}
{"text":"The sweet pork belly was amazing! Don't be fooled by the location or outside. The inside is nice and the food is fantastic. I highly recommend it. They have big portions too. My friend and I shared a dish and had left overs."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Korean food,  but this place was pretty good.  The place had a real cool vibe with people from all ages there.   It was real lively and the portions were massive.   The food comes out hot and tasty.   I recommend this place if you want some good Korean food."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, service was really slow, it seems they might be trying to find their groove. Hopefully it gets better as the business matures. Will be back, has a great ambiance and open feel."}
{"text":"Good spot to eat out when in Chandler/Mesa. A little more mainstream than some of my other favorites but overall decent."}
{"text":"Pork bulgogi and seafood soon tofu were delicious! So glad we found this place on Yelp and decided to stop by"}
{"text":"YEAH........legit.....totally legit.
Huge place, good wait staff, loved it.
The reviews are really accurate about this place.
I had the spicy chicken boulgaki for lunch, extra spicy and it did not disappoint.
It came out sizzling on a platter with white rice. I didn't think I was going to eat it all, but I killed it!!!
My brother had the chicken fried rice, and the bowl was huge, he's easily going to get 3 meals out of it. 
Awesome place, I'll be back sooner than you think!!"}
{"text":"I generally come here because it is clean, spacious, and flavor is good. The service is hit and miss. It has gotten really lax as of lately. I think the portions are a bit bigger than some of the competitors. I like that I don't have to cook it myself. I hate those kind of korean food places."}
{"text":"By far the best tasting, cleanest and great customer service in the Phoenix area. This was my first time here. We ordered pork soup, kimchi cold noodles and spicy squid stir-fry. All of it was great! This is our new place and really does put other places to shame. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First things first- The spicy porkbelly is a MUST. I've been to Koreatown multiple times and it's been pretty consistent. I fell in love with the friend rice so i haven't deviated from it much, but I've tried other dishes from my sharing friends  They have a nice selection of Korean cuisine, the beef bulgolgi is quite flavorful. Of course, the coveted hot pot is great, I'd say a fair distribution of seafood inside so you won't feel cheated. Only negative is the service can be very iffy- non existent at times unfortunately but the food won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"It was interesting since they have multigrain rice here. Even at Hoddoki, they don't serve multigrain rice. It is really nice on how their ban chan is very flavorful. I liked the bulgogi of course! Very sweet, savory, and light. The spicy chicken though, was on fire!! Like it was so good but it was really spicy. It was bloody red(spice color not meat color) and was very flavorful. Their Army base stew was rather salty. If you don't like too much salt, ask if you can have veggies on the side to take out some salt. This place is closer to any Korean bbq restaurant I have ever been to. Compared to Chodang, Koreatown does much better and I would put Koreatown slightly higher on the ranking than Hoddoki even though Hoddoki is more korean(?) I don't know how to state this but, KOREATOWN HAS KPOP RADIO AND I HEARD MY FAVORITE KOREAN ARTISTS PLAYING. It was heaven. Hoddoki doesn't do that. The smell of an authentic Korean restaurant is very obvious. Very enjoyable for Korean bbq lovers. Sorry about my super long review :)"}
{"text":"One of the better Korean places I've been too but NOT THE BEST in comparison to California restaurants. The reason why I'm giving it five stars is because in comparison to the arizona places, it's really good. Service was great and everything was clean.
We went in looking for bibimbaps, so we got the basic meat one and the fish eggs. Although both were a little bit pricey, the taste matched the expectations that went along with the high prices. The rice was perfectly crisp with the stone bowl, something that didn't happen often at other places. 
They gave a lot of banchans for free and there was also free refills.
The place is nicely decorated and super clean as expected of newly opened place. Service was friendly. I will definitely come back to try other food"}
{"text":"This place is superb! If you're looking for good Korean food, look no further. We ordered the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi and Kimchi Stew with Pork Belly. Both were outstanding and served with complimentary rice and side dishes. Service was friendly and attentive. Bathrooms are brand new and extremely clean. Can't recommend this place enough! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went to lunch rather late. It was just before 3 pm. I was sat down by the server. I could not believe it. They were playing (C)rap in a KOREAN restaurant. I was sitting close to the speakers. I asked to be moved to the other end of the room. (C)rap and I do NOT get along at all. It then took the server a while to bring me my water. I find the prices quite high, in comparison to other Korean restaurants in the area. I ordered Pork Bulgogi. They brought me some side dishes. I have had better once, for sure. The Bulgogi was OK.. Nothing to email/text home about!! The server did not show up at my table at all, after she brought me my food. I know, that I will NOT go back to that place. There are far better restaurants in the East Valley with far better service."}
{"text":"This is my first time for dinner. Food is okay. Our waitress is not respectful at all to customers. I would never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have been going here whenever I can over the past year, I have had the most delicious food! This place is my absolute favorite!! (The photos are just some delicious things I've eaten) basically this has become the place where I get my Kimchi Stew fix! I just want to try everything!!"}
{"text":"This definitely is my favorite Korean place in the Phoenix area. They have a whole array of traditional and modern Korean food items and side dishes are more than enough to please your palate. And you get so much for how much you pay."}
{"text":"After reading reviews and looking at photos and watching videos I decided to trek all the way to Mesa to see what the big deal was. Thanks to some excellent photography from Mark R I was hooked.

I've tried a few items and I have left the building in a food coma every time. My favorites include the Jap Chae, which are glass noodles, similar to a Filipino Sotanghon noodle dish. This is an appetizer which I order to be served with the main dishes. To ME, this dish can serve as a main dish since it is so filling by itself.

Other favorites include the spicy Chicken Bulgogi. Just make sure you have a cold beverage handy because it can get fuego. This dish is served with grilled onions on a hot skillet. Another favorite is the Beef Bulgogi, which is a little sweet but not spicy. Again, this dish is served in a skillet. I've also had the pork bellies which are delicious. But I'm usually out voted because my dining companions are partial to the chicken and beef dishes.

The service is always excellent and the food arrives quickly. I was surprised to see that I was the Duke the last time I checked in. Mark R, you have some \"exsplaining\" to do as to why you're not the Duke!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant located in the AZ International Market Place Parking Lot. The interior of the restaurant is modern airy and sleek looking. My review is based on one lunch visit.

I had the Spicy Chirashi or Sushi Salad. 
The seafood and greens seemed pristine fresh and I liked the choice of purple rice. The waitress was very kind and she told me Koreans eat the salad mixing in the rice to the salad.

I tried some of the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi from my husband's plate. It came out bubbling hot on a skillet. The chicken was expertly cooked and was very tender and moist. I didn't care for the sauce because it was cloyingly sweet and not so spicy.

I feel because of the sauce on the Bulgogi I would want to give this restaurant 3.5 stars but will round it up because of Service, Atmosphere and Freshness of food.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food and service at any restaurant in the valley. Service is top notch and is very attentive to your needs providing a very caring dining experience. The food is always consistently great regardless of if we try a new dish or go back to our favorites. The place is always busy and yet the staff never lets you feel like you aren't the most important table there."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for our monthly ethnic lunch and it was really good! I got the cherashi  (sp?) Sashimi salad and couldn't even finish it! The hot pots and bulgogi looked fantastic! Large portions, a little in the pricey side. Great service."}
{"text":"Do you cringe at nature shows where you spend 25 minutes watching the travails of some baby wildebeast, who towards the end of the show, while pausing for a river drink, is suddenly ripped to pieces by a lurking crocodile?  Do you feel any better when the narrator closes the show with some pithy, wisened words about nature, the life cycle, and evolution?

Well - Koreatown is basically a baby wildebeast.  After spending time there you will become emotionally involved.  The folks that run the place are super nice.  They are doing everything right.  Good service.  Clean.  Friendly.  Good food.  But I think this place is at risk of  a cringe-worthy ending.

The problem is the location - a depressed, half-empty shopping center (very quiet anchor supermarket has huge banner across it advertising they accept food stamps/EBT).   The restaurant is adjacent to 'Superlaundry'.  So despite deserving to survive (kind of like nearby Oma's Place which closed last year) - I fear there is a giant croc in the waters.

The place is huge and surprisingly pleasant inside.  Why these folks opted for such a large space I do not understand.  You could set up a dance floor and pool tables and still have plenty of room for lots of tables.  Why rent such a large space?  And the operators keep everything immaculate - even the bathrooms are huge and super clean.

Foodwise I had a 3.5 star dish of seafood udon ($12), which contained lots of minaturized shellfish like tiny clams, scallops, mini bits of squid, small shrimps, and mussels.  My only complaint was the udon was a bit gritty - too many broken shells created during the stir frying process.  Served alongside were 5 pretty solid vegan banchan items.  

Service was attentive.  Everyone really friendly.  This is the type of place and the type of family you want to root for.  They are working really hard to please.

But I think this baby wildebeast is at risk.  A nice interior, great service, and $12 for seafood udon would  work in Scottsdale or some other wealthier locale - but being sited where it is I think the economic crocodile is looming nearby...  I can't watch."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Korean restaurant in arizona. 

The service was quick, polite and so helpful. Me and my boyfriend ordered kalbi, mixed soon tofu and bossam (pork belly lettuce wraps). The broth was beautiful and Spicey for the soon tofu, packed with so much protein. The kalbi was deliciously marinated and sizzling hot when it came out. The bossam was tender and the fresh ingredients that came along were so lovely. Also, the 8 side dishes that came first were fantastic, it was my first time seeing spicey marinated squid within the options and it was amazingg. 

By the end of it we were so delighted and full but it didn't stop just yet, the awesome waiter brought out a complimentary piece of cake, ahaha. We could not resist! This place was incredible and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com! Pretty much everything here is good, you won't be disappointed. I would recommend any of the pancakes, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with korean cuisine but I know when something is delicious. I got the chicken hot pot and it was super colorful, fresh, and a hugely satisfying portion. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food, bar none. Fresh, clean, authentic flavors. Courteous and friendly staff. Anything on the menu is a super choice. From one Korean to another, ma-shi-ta!"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and they had 2 huge parties at both ends - understandably service wasn't probably what it likely usually is. Our server was nice & very apologetic. 
The food was good, but it lacked the kick and spiciness I'm used to. 
I saw a lot of hot pots floating around, perhaps Koreatown is known for that. I ordered the Korean pancake & Bimbimbap. The pancake I'd go back for, and to try a hot pot. The sides and bimbimbap however, were a bit lackluster."}
{"text":"Great Korean food! The staff was very friendly. Kimchi and pork stir fry was delicious. Even got my picky boyfriend to like it."}
{"text":"We walked in around 530pm and the place was not busy at all. The first thing we noticed was the restaurant is big and very clean. The server came to our table with food in his mouth and he was chewing. It was strange. He got our beverage order and gave us our menus. There are a lot of choices to choose from. We decided to get the stone pots kalbi/bulgogi and the Korean BBQ platter bulgogi. The waiter came back and he started to wipe his nose repetitively, while he's sniffling, with his fingers. Gross! Then proceeded to take our food order. I really didn't want to eat anything but I was here with friends.  The Kalbi stone pot came with 3 pieces of meat, the bulgogi stone pot probably a cup of meat. The bulgogi platter could serve 2 people it had a lot of meat. Everything tasted good! Overall, the place was clean, service was fast and the food was good. The management just needs to train the server on table etiquette."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim.  We were checking out the local market and decided to give it a go.

We arrived and the room was about half full.  But they made us wait in the foyer.  Why?  There are empty tables.  At least they gave us a menu to peruse.

So they take us to a table (there are still a lot of empty tables here!), and the waiter explains the menu.  Looking for bibimbap?  It's not there under that name.  It's under \"stone bowls\".  Those dishes are brought out in very hot stone bowls, and those bowls actually finish cooking the food for you.  Stab the nearly raw egg of your bibimbap and start stirring...it finishes cooking really fast.

So my wife orders that, and I go for bulgogi.  This comes with \"side dishes\".  These are small bowls full of weird things.  Some are fine, some not so much.  But of course that's personal taste.  The broccoli was tasty.  The fish strips were kind of odd, but not bad.  I think there was eggplant, and cucumber, but I can't remember them all now.  You can have as much of the sides as you want, which is kinda nice.  Honestly, I'd rather have a soup or something similar.

My bulgogi came with purple rice.  Apparently they cook it with a variety of bean, and that turns it purple.  Don't let it bother you, it's really nice.  My wife stirred in her egg and the bibimbap came together pretty quickly for her.  We both liked our food.  Serving was big enough to take about half home.  Still a bit pricey even with the larger portions and endless sides.

Service was slow and inattentive.  They didn't seem to be slammed (empty tables!), but maybe they were short-staffed?  Dunno.  But we had to call our waiter over or he didn't visit our table.  This is really probably 3.5 stars, but with the mediocre service I can't justify rounding up to 4.  So three stars it is.  The food was pretty good.  We might come back, though I'm hearing about another place I might want to try first (Hodori - not has highly rated as this place though)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I can say the service could be better. But I love the food. The pork belly anything is good, as is the grilled squid. And all of the side dishes. 

The hot pots are labeled as \"serves 2 persons\" but it definitely feeds 4-6. The seafood one has a lot of soft shelled crab in there. But the soup is flavorful and has lots of things in there."}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona from SoCal and we're looking for some authentic Korean food. Yelp lead us to Koreatown and we're so happy it did. The restaurant is extremely clean. The staff are friendly. And the food is spot on. Delicious, fresh, hot & spicy. Can't wait to come back & bring our friends."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!  We are adventurous eaters but never had tried Korean. When we told our server we were newbies, she walked us through the menu carefully and spent time helping us navigate the options. She was awesome, and said how excited she was for us to be able to try a new cuisine. We ordered multiple items, and everything we ordered was tasty. We are excited to go back and try Hot Pot.  I also loved all of the \"sides\" that come with your meal.  Two thumbs up between awesome service and great food."}
{"text":"My wife & I came here of dinner on a Friday evening. We were greeted nicely, and was shown to our table quickly.

At first, the restaurant was somewhat empty. But shorty after we placed our order, a crowd came in and filled up all remaining tables quickly.

The Korean condiments and kimchi were fairly standard. 

The pan-seared brisket salad was somewhat a disappointment. Our expectation of \"pan-sear\" is different than what this restaurant provided. Its beef was cooked in the oven, then thinly sliced. The meat was cooked through, well done. We expected the beef to be crispy on the outside and at least pink on the inside. the sesame-ginger dressing was pretty good and the greens were very fresh though. 

The spicy chicken bulgogi was well seasoned but not spicy at all. The sauce was way too sweet for my taste. It was serve with one bowl of purple rice, which was regular rice steamed with cracked red (?) beans. I am not sure what to make of this purple rice. 

The menu of this restaurant had no Korean dessert. I was disappointed. I was looking forward to trying out Korean desserts. Instead, there was a small board at the entrance advertising \"Tres Leches\" and 2 other cheese cakes. The \"Tres Leches\" cake was good, light and lightly sweet; it would pair well with coffee.

The service staff was friendly and polite. But the service itself was confusing. Our order was taken by one person, the appetizer was brought out by another, the main dish by yet another. We didn't know who to ask for additional plates, for example. 

I am not sure this restaurant earns my recommendation, but I don't want to discourage people from trying it. I hope it will improve with time."}
{"text":"I went there today and I am not impressed... The bulgogi meat didn't have flavor, just like the seafood soup. The restaurant Gogi not far is way better."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Arizona!  No Joke!  Try it for yourself and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of yelp reviews but HAD to share my love for this place. I was craving Asian food tonight and had never tried a Korean place before so I didn't really know what to order. We decided to get the beef bulgogi, which was amazing. The chicken bulgogi was also amazing. We also got the spicy tuna salad, sort of reminds me of an ahi poki bowl. This had so much amazing fresh fish and flavor! I cannot wait to go back and try more things at this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Out of all the korean places I've tried in Arizona, this one is the best. I lived in Korea for a good year & some change and this is as close as It's get to familiar taste like how it is back in Korea."}
{"text":"Great food had the fish it was awesome look like very creative menu first time there so I'm gonna go back but I liked what I saw very courteous they take cash and cards love the service"}
{"text":"Delicious hot stone bowl / bi bam bop! Loved all their veggies, chicken is tossed in teriyaki, rice is perfect. All around loved it. Very nice inside - parking lot is deceiving."}
{"text":"Came in around lunchtime on a weekend and there was almost nobody else here. We ordered the galbi and bulgogi hot stone and the kimchi soup. Everything had great flavor and I really enjoyed the kimchi soup! Couldn't believe how empty the place was, but our waiter told us that they recently opened and didn't advertise much. I'm sure this place will be around and I'm glad because I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My hubby and some friends like to pick out there places and we found this Quaint little place! The service was great, and the food was even better!!! Talked to the waitress in the few words of Korean my hubby and I knew and she brought over a plate of spicy chicken bulgogi on the house! We will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"My group ordered the Pork Bulgolgi, Oxtail Soup, Pork Belly and Seafood Pancake. This is the second time we have been here and the food was great. 

This is the second time we have been here and we thought the food was great the first time too. It was a rainy, cool night in Mesa so we ordered hot tea, which was included with the meal. The hot Barley tea was just right because I was cold. 

The service was very fast and efficient and our side dishes were served immediately. There was kimchee, fish cake, cucumbers, sprouts, broccoli, pickled radish, potato and zucchini. 

The soup had four large pieces of oxtail in the soup. We ordered sesame oil/salt to complement the pork belly which was served with onions. The Pork Bulgogi with onions was ordered mild and was not spicy at all and had good flavor. The Seafood Pancake was light and crispy.

We had a party of four and there were leftovers. My father-in-law absolutely loved the purple rice. I believe it was a rice/bean mixture. We will always stop by Koreatown anytime we are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"A new Korean restaurant opened up and I had to come give it a try. It's located in the plaza where the new international Asian market opened. As soon as you walk i was surprised to see how spacious and open the restaurant was. I loved that the tables were not crammed right next to each other like most Korean restaurants are. I ordered the spicy pork tofu soup which was delicious & I finished the whole thing. The soup could have been spicier but i forgot to tell our waitress how spicy I wanted it; next time I'll remember to do that. ( they have 3 levels of how spicy you want the soup)
The side dishes were ok.. I've had better at other Korean restaurants. I definitely will be back to try some of their other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Lots of variety on the menu. Tasty food but very slow and somewhat painful service (had to get someone's attention several times to get our orders in, silverwares and drinks). Although our waiter, Jin was very helpful to recommend someone who eats gluten-free dish."}
{"text":"When the waiter took our order, he must've thought we were uninitiated in Korean dining.  We ordered the Korean fried chicken (which was a plate of fried wings for $18), the japchae noodles, and the bulgogi beef and mushroom hot pot (or casserole).  We ordered these dishes mostly for the kids and didn't order the more traditional and spicier Korean dishes.  The ban Chan was decent.  The fried chicken was fried well but a little bland.  The japchae was alright maybe a little overcooked and mushy.  But the bulgogi hotpot was way too sweet.  The bulgogi was a generous but thick clump of meat in the middle of the hotpot.  It tasted a lot like the Costco bulgogi (which is very sweet).  We probably should have ordered the soft tofu soup and the spicy stir fried squid if we wanted more of the spicy Korean flavors we were craving. Service was decent, the restaurant is spacious and clean, but the dishes were disappointing and pricey.  If we give this place another try, we will try the other dishes on the menu but will steer clear of the ones we ordered tonight."}

Gotta Yelp a place to some bites that's right for me
Time to keep me eating, keep me munchin with some energy

Well, I Yelp about it Yelp about it
Yelp about it, Yelp

Yelp about eating

Gotta move on

Gotta move on

A-won't you take me to Koreatown?
Won't you take me to Koreatown?
Won't you take me to Koreatown?
Won't you take me to Koreatown?


Koreatown is a spacious Korean eats hot spot that is fairly new.  The place is located in the same shopping mall as the International Market where you can find almost anything!

My first thought of Koreatown was the signage wasn't that great and plus you really couldn't see if from the street.  The place itself however is very large and can seem to seat up to 50 plus and great for large groups.  

For starters I ordered the Japchae; sweet potato starch glass noodles fried with vegetables and beef.  To my surprise this starter was quite large and can definitely be an entree if you love this dish.  Slippery noodles with a prominent sweetness to it, while the vegetables provided a hint of crunch.  Overall, my favorite bite of the night!  For my entree I went with the  Chirashi sushi bowl; pretty much sashimi cut in cubes served with a salad.  The dressing came on the side which I appreciated; it was sweet with a hint of spiciness.  

Overall, my experience was great.  Korean food is starting to pop up around the valley and they keep getting better!  Koreatown is well received in my books and definitely a spot I'll keep attending since the menu is meant for a foodie to explore! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally a great Korean BBQ restaurant right here in Mesa! I love the variety of the food here. The food tastes very good, and very big portions! I had the bulogogi beef and my husband had the spicy chicken. Had lots of flavor and it was balanced and not too overpowering when it came to the spices. They give you a bunch of different tiny dishes with things such as fish tofu and cucumbers etc. The food are served in a hot clay pot type dish. They give you a lot so one serving could possibly fill 2-3 people up! I like that the environment of the place felt very simple but relaxing. The staff are very attentive and always come by to see how you're doing. It would have been cool if it were one of those cook while you eat type BBQ places but i dont mind it much. I like the place and will definitely be coming back! Kinda pricey, but worth it to come once in a while. :)"}
{"text":"A lot to improve food wise (or at least for my taste, still prefer good ol' Hodori even if Korea Town is a lot cheaper). Good service, restaurant was clean, ambiance was comfy & casual. But the food and their banchan were just meh. My friends and I ordered Japchae, Kimchi fried rice and Stir fry Squid. I probably wouldn't try any of those again. Their Japchae was on the sweet side - a tad bit sweeter than our usual taste. Actually, everything was a tad bit sweeter. They offer domestic beers (12 oz for 4 bucks - yikes!) and some imported beers like Kirin, big ones for 6 bucks which was a standard price on korean/asian places. They offer wine and sake and soju as well. 

I love supporting local businesses. And I wish they thrive in this economy. However I do hope they offer other outstanding dishes that'll make me crave to be back for more. Maybe one day I'll try Korea Town again but different entrees this time. And so consider this a review in progress. ;)"}
{"text":"I usually go to Hodori but this place is so much better!!!   Their seafood pancake is amazing and I absolutely love their bulgogi bibimbap!! Their customer service is best out of the Korean restaurants in the east valley too!  I'll be coming here instead of Hodori and Cho dang."}
{"text":"I saw that my friend Kurdy visited here and since I was going to be in Mesa doing errands I decided to check out Koreatown for lunch.

The place is huge with all the tables really spaced out.  I was greeted immediately and seated by the window.

I saw on the board as I walked in that they had fresh lemonade and since it was 110 degrees outside I went with that.  I didn't really like the lemonade, however, as it seemed very syrupy.

For food I went with the beef bulgogi hot stone.  Before it arrived six side dishes came out and they were all good.  I liked the kimchi a lot!

The bulgogi tasted as good as it looked.  It was delicious and was certainly quite filling, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is decent for the Korean food you can get in Phoenix. Reminds me of cafeteria food like what you can get at the Korean markets back east."}
{"text":"Just finished my meal here and I am IMPRESSED. I've not been to South Korea and for a non-Korean I've had a decent amount of great Korean food in NYC's actual Koreatown. This was a great dinner at a great value and good portions. We have enough leftovers for both our lunches tomorrow! We got the hot stone bulgogi, dumplings, and pork-kimchi stir fry. The banchan was also very awesome and had distinct, refreshing flavors. 

Everything was so good that I know for next time, I can order whatever and I'll be happy and content."}
{"text":"This place is so fresh and delicious! Very clean friendly staff and great service! The lunch menu is on point! Had the sashimi bowl and it was solid! Love all the little sides they bring out too! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and my friends brought me here for dinner. The food was phenomenal.  We couldn't stop eating bc we ordered so much good stuff. 

I cannot say the same for the service. We were left begging for napkins, refills on drinks, the check.  At first they came and dropped off food that didn't belong to us. 

We were a bit confused until we called them back over to point out the mistake. It's weird bc that restaurant isn't THAT BIG. 

My friends go back often bc the food is so good... But they said the service is always bad. :/"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Every single dish I've tried is really good. I've been here twice and my family and I always want to go back. 

My favorite dish is the kimchi fried rice. Normally I am really picky about fried rice, especially with kimchi. You have to try it. The fried pork belly is also really good when dipped in the soybean paste sauce. 

Highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Both the food and service were excellent. We really enjoyed the galbi and the seafood pancake was probably one of the best ones I have ever had."}
{"text":"kimchi was really good along with the pork dumplings. My entree? I've had better bibimbop in Colorado....not a lot of flavor and the sides weren't that fresh...especially the cucumbers... Service was not good either...we showed up about 4:30 Saturday the 14, it was not busy at all, staff was standing around chatting. We were not priority!"}
{"text":"I usually only write on here to let you know if it is either really shitty or really good! Hands down this is my new favorite Korean BBQ place to eat at now. You will not be disappointed! I recommend the Gabli,spicy pork belly, and the hot plate pancake!"}
{"text":"I had the bulgogi and galbi bibimbap and it was very satisfying. The restaurant is really spacious so it's good for big group to dine in. Price was alright..same as other Korean restaurants I've been to. Service was good, too."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Korean food all around. I was pretty happy with the service too. I would recommend trying this place out"}
{"text":"Best Korean food in the east valley. And super clean. Kimchi pancake, bulgogi hot pot, kimchi tofu soup, dumplings."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy! Seafood hot pot was delicious and spicy!. . My kids had the fried rice it was pretty big portion it lacked soy sauce but was still pretty good..we will definitely be back!. Really good service too"}
{"text":"Came back to Mesa AZ for my graduation and wanted some Korean food afterwards to celebrate with family.  This place was great! The staff was friendly and the food hit the spot.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Second time in AZ and was craving some Korean food. I thought I give this place a try since it had good reviews. If you're looking to have authentic homemade tasting Korean food, give yourself a favor and go to hodori nearby. We ordered a soup and a pork dish and I was pretty disappointed with both. I also ended drinking tone of water after. This normally happens when they use msg. I'm definetly sticking to hodori for Korean when in AZ."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ is something I've wanted to try for a while now. So for Valentine's Day, I told my fiancé the only thing I wanted to do is go out to eat at this place. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. We received some of the best food and service that we have ever had! Our waiter took such good care of us. He kept our banchan and water full, answered our questions, took our cheesy Valentine's photo, and even took a celebratory shot of soju with us to help polish off our bottle before we left. So friendly! The food was insanely delicious, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! I'm hooked. We had such a great time celebrating Valentine's Day here."}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant has an extensive menu from noodles to stews to sashimi to KFC with fries (Korean Fried Chicken). We ordered naengmyun in cold broth and in spicy sauce. The flavor was excellent. The noodles were well prepared al dente with great texture.  Kalbi cut LA style with grilled onions were well seasoned and made delicious with char marks. We also had KFC in spicy sauce and garlic sauce served with pickled white radish and French fries. The raw fish salad over rice was also excellent.  I would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"Lots of seating so you'll most likely not have to wait for a table. Great place to find Bibimbap and Soondubu. The Bibimbap is delicious but the soondubu base could use a little more seasoning. It comes out looking like hot lava but it is a tasty and comforting dish. I wish my first two bowls of rice came free! 

Overall, I will return for my korean food cravings."}
{"text":"Been in AZ 5 years & finally found the best Korean restaurant in the valley!! Food & service is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"ADIOS HODORI, HELLO KOREATOWN!  This is the best Korean restaurant in metro Phoenix area for certain.  I was surprised by the variety of the menu and 8 of us ordered different menu items and they were all excellent.  I had Cod Roe Soup and Caviar Hot Stone.  Freshness of the ingredients was very evident. I have been going to Hodori for my craving for Korean food past 14 years but this is the place I will be going from now on."}
{"text":"Great time. Head on down. Whether you are adventurous or timid, you will find something you like. And you're going to love how the staff welcomes you.

I need to echo another reviewer's perfect representation of the atmosphere: \"open and clean...\"

Typically my wife leaves the more authentic Asian fare to me and my friend Brian. The other day I wheedled her into a trip to the awesome little Asia of Dobson Road and Broadway. And stepping into Koreatown I verified they had wine and then waved her in.

A friendly face greeted us at the door and showed us to a table. A Cass and a chard materialized shortly thereafter. We were on our way. We ordered the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), Spicy Pork Bulgogi hot stone pot, and some fried rice. Kimchi and 9 other pickled appetizers came. I'm a huge kimchi and bulgogi fan, been that way since I lived with a Koren family when I was in 9th and 10th grades. I was truly in heaven within 5 minutes of sitting. And then the meal came. Fantastic, all of it. Once again I lament my limited stomach capacity and my waning metabolism. Really looking forward to trying other dishes.

The wife says we're going back. The universe is loving me. Mind you, this is the same wife that makes me sleep on the couch when I eat kimchi. No gonna question or argue.

Oh happy day."}
{"text":"Koreatown was good! We ordered bulgogi, japchae, and tempura. The portions were generous and the taste was exceptional. The service could improve a little bit, but overall, I'm glad to have this Korean restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am on the hunt for the best bibimbap in the valley, which lead me to Koreatown in Mesa. It is a bright and spacious (huge!) restaurant! I started with the glass of of red wine. After asking a few questions about the pancakes, our server tried to talk me out of getting the kimchi pancake (I think just out of worry that I wouldn't like it). But it was amazing! My favorite thing I tried. We also got the galbi hot stone (short rib). I will say the portion sizes are huge and we weren't able to finish everything between two people. But the actual short rib portion was small, especially when you take out the bone. It wasn't the best bibimbap I have ever have, but it was still pretty darn good and made me immensely happy!"}
{"text":"The dumplings here were some of the worst I've ever had. The kimchee soup was good, however the pork they put in the soup was basically all fat meat. Prices were very high in comparison to other Korean restaurants in town and since the food wasn't better, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It feeds me but not delights me.  The taste needs great improvement.  The food is much sweeter than what we had in other restaurants and the soup is very very sour.  The service and the environment is good but I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Highly surprised how good this place is. Took my boyfriend and his son.  They really liked the food. Coming from someone who is Korean and from the Bay Area, was impressed how authentic the food was. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It is the best Korean rest that we have been too. Service is very good and they gave a complimentary dessert before we left . Have to go again and try the many differ items"}
{"text":"I stopped by to try out the seafood tofu soup. The soup was exactly what I expected. Servers were nice and the place was large for group dining."}
{"text":"Bimbibap bulgogi. Excellent. Soo-Jin = superb service and advice. Unique comfortable atmosphere. Many sides with main order. Soju and saki available. Best Korean around as far as I've been able to discover."}
{"text":"We took great interest in this Korean restaurant due to a long list of positive reviews on Yelp. We wanted to learn if the food would live up to its name, especially given how it had been compared to those in LA Koreatown. During our visits, the interior was spacious with a red and orange colored setting. There were several TVs available to accompany the wall-to-wall images of Korean home-style dishes. With plenty of long tables neatly arranged across the open floor, the restaurant encompassed all the appropriate characteristics for groups, families, and casual gatherings. 

The Mandu ($6.99) came with a number of dumplings served on a bed of vegetables. The appearance of the veggies was odd. The fillings were also too skimpy, and not as plump as I expected them to be. Not recommended.

The Dolsot Spicy Chicken Bibimbap ($12.99) came with a sunny side egg, spicy chicken, namul, and purple rice served in a hot stone bowl. The spicy chicken was tender and delicious, and the charred purple rice came out with a decent amount of crispiness and texture. The overall composition was then underscored by the spicy gochujang sauce with a taste of nutty sesame oil that lingered in the background. We both thought the serving size was noticeably smaller when compared to restaurants like GOGI. The wow factor also did not measure up to the one at Seongbukdong.

The Grilled Mackerel ($11.99) was nicely executed and served with purple rice. The Mackerel was buttery, flaky, and flavorful. The serving size was again smaller than other restaurants, but I did like the fact that it was less salty than the ones I had before.

I was really looking forward to the Galbi Tang ($11.99), but it turned out to be a disappointment. The bulky piece of rib was not fresh at all, and the meat only came off the bone after several struggles. Eggs and glass noodles were also added to the broth, but the profile was too peppery and desperately needed daikon to brighten the flavor. It was a fail.

I tried to order the Ddukbokki, but they were charging $28 for a dish that I can easily get elsewhere for less than $10.

The atmosphere was quiet and subdued on each of our visit. We find the service to be minimal and efficient, and our banchan were refilled upon request. The six to eight item banchan were on the saltier side, but still enjoyable as the flavors were mostly on point. My favorite was the kimchi due to the moist and spicy flavor without it being too sour. The fish cake was also addictive and deserved several refills. Overall, I didn't think this place measured up to the restaurants in Koreatown, or even GOGI in Chandler, which is not saying much given the limited options available in Arizona. I came to visit with high hopes, but I don't think I would return any time soon."}
{"text":"Ordered soft tofu soup with pork, and kalbi with cold noodle combo. Kalbi and cold noodle were ok, but the pork in the soft tofu soup smells soooo bad. The pork must be spoiled or they used bad quality of meat. We had to take out all the meat from the soup, but soup still had disgusting smelly taste. I told the waitress about that, but she said meat is fresh. 
What??? There is no way that fresh meat has that bad smell. 
           .                ??  .             ....
         ?   ?"}
{"text":"The hot stone plates were everything I could ask for. Great sized, delicious food, and good service. Several people in our group ordered them. The spicy pork was what I chose at the recommendation of our server and it was fantastic. Two others got the beef and they had good things to say as well."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the only think that wasn't good was the service. I ask for my hot green tea 3 times and finally came. 

They need to have a better service management for sure.

My seafood hot-pot was so delicious!"}
{"text":"We went to koreatown again to try Gamjatang and Galbi. We heard that their Gamjatang was good from our friends and wanted to try it out. Again, this was not the best Gamjatang that i ever had, but it was pretty good. Gamjatang was meant to be for 2 people, but it was enough to feed 3 people I think. We were satisfied with the flavor and quantity. The Galbi was good but it is hard not to be good, since it is quite easy to make. Our server was again very well trained and greeted us with the smile."}
{"text":"Went to Mekong AZ International market and decided to stop by to check it out.  It's been open for a little bit.  The place is nice sized for seating.  The waitress was very nice.  I opted to try a cold & spicy potato noodle dish and spicy chicken bulgogi.  And they even had the purple rice!!! Everything was seasoned well and tasted great.  So worth it, will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for awesome Korean bbq and flavored soju (try the grapefruit one)!! The food here is delicious, love the bibimbaps and the soups... a must visit for us at least once every month!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to find out about this place, especially since it's not too far from campus. So far, most of the food we have ordered has tasted decent. Stay away from the seafood kalgooksu though because it definitely tastes off for some reason. The reason for the docked stars is due to the service. Just like others have said in their reviews, sometimes they get orders wrong or forget dishes. While this may happen at any restaurant once in awhile, it seems to occur regularly here whether it's busy or not. But otherwise, pretty good and we'll be sure to come again."}
{"text":"Nice place. The food is fine. A little cheaper than Hodori. And they provide more small dishes. I will come back with my friends."}
{"text":"Bibimpap is good. Galbi bbq - perfect. But not a lot of variety in their banchan. Clean place. Waiter answered all our questions about their food. Will be back to try other food"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I do like this place. I ordered a hotpot with rice cake and stuffs but it was kinda dissappointed. The staff is nice, the food is good!
I will come back to try their tofu soup!"}
{"text":"I liked this place very much before. Have been here very often. Well, today when I came here for BBQ and tofu soup, the service is extremely bad. They serve us with something that people from other table already ate it. When we ask for a change, they just left without taking those food away. When we check, we have to wait for a long time to get a box. While the other Americans sit next to us immediately get their check and boxes... I can't help but wonder they don't welcome Asian people? So no tips today..."}
{"text":"Went with lots of friends so got to try things. The Korean dumplings were great, they were fried, so go in knowing that. But they were not dry and came with a dark dipping sauce that was good. The soft bean curd soup was a surprise favorite, wish we had ordered more to take home. It tastes great mixed with rice as well. My favorite of the night, besides the never ending tall bottles of Kirin, was the spicy chicken bulgogi. The portion was huge and I ate it for several lunches afterwards. Chicken was moist with onions in a thick spice pepper sauce. The beef bulgogi was a bit sweet for us. I actually took that home and made some kickass sandwiches the next day. The fish, well while edible maybe they should ask if you want it, poor little guy all uneaten and left for scrap at the end of the night. Our service was so-so, they seemed busy even though the place wasn't packed, we had to wave down servers for refills at times. But the food came on time and was hot and fresh, place was clean and very well lit. Will go again."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and I really enjoy this place. They actually have excellent service and the side dishes are really great. If they find out that you're Korean they will give you a few more more \"Korean\"side dishes as well. Definitely try out the braised  cod dish as it's our favorite now and it's absolutely delicious. Right now beers are on sale for four dollars and the server are really excellent and friendly (unusual for K restaurants, trust me)  I'm really happy that this place opened."}
{"text":"This place was decent but the chicken bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi was not all that or better than Hodori's off of Dobson Road. The fried rice was yummy and the jap chae was flavorful but took much liquid at the bottom. The seafood cake had plenty of seafood in it but the sauce on the side wasn't enough. It still tasted bland so maybe a different kind of sauce to top it off would have made all the difference. The sides were good but they didn't  get refilled until we asked for them."}
{"text":"Yay for a decent soondubu place in AZ! My family lives in the Phoenix area and I'm so glad they found this place and brought me here. Got the kimchi soondubu with purple rice (which was a good portion for a Korean restaurant!). There was a good variety of banchan and all were quite tasty. Such a satisfying meal on a chilly winter night!"}
{"text":"We ordered seafood hotpot. I am so surprised because there are lots clam, scallop, mussel more than enough for 2 people. The crab may not good to eat but make the soup so tasty. I will come back again especially winter."}
{"text":"Although I'm leaving the area very soon, this is the place I'm definitely going to have to go back to. As the food was just amazing, and I got this off the lunch menu. I can't imagine what the dinner menu would be all about.

There's something about Korean food that's very difficult to describe. It's sweet and spicy yet not overwhelming and the flavors really stay with whatever protein you were having. They use on namely cuts of beef and make them special. From, the richness of short ribs, to the flank but they're cut so strangely but it's hardly recognizable. However the beef is so tender and so sweet that it makes your dining experience all that much better. I had the Galbi, which is nothing more than grilled beef and rice however it taste so special that I could've eaten 10 bowls of the Galbi.

Service, well yes it was excellent the people there are very sweet and the restaurant is very clean. Like I said before I leave this area I'm going to have to go buy one more time and get something totally different."}
{"text":"This is my current favorite Korean restaurant. I've had the tofu soup, galbi, squid and pork belly, bibimbap hot stone, and seafood hotpot. I liked all the dishes except the hot pot. The seafood was a bit bland for me. I love their wide variety of side dishes here. I love the side fish they give when you order the seafood tofu soup. The fish cake side dish is too bland for me -it needs more sauce. The service can be a bit slow here. It took me a while to ask them for the check because My waitress wasn't in the kitchen sorting out inventory. They do not refill your water cups often enough either."}
{"text":"#HowUDoin Awesome place really enjoyed my first experience eating Korean food! The pork belly, spicy fried chicken, purple rice and Army Bowl gets the special #UncleEddieEats  Oooooooooo #ThatsDelicious for this Excellent meal. Also service was fantastic and establishment was very clean! Looking forward to our next trip as you can tell from the picture with the steam coming from our meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's in a very convenient area for people in Tempe and Mesa. The parking is very easy as well.

The restaurant is spacious with tables good for all sizes of groups. The staff has always been nice and very fast with our order.

I like how the food is delicious and you get a lot, but also not overpriced. I've had their kimchi fried rice, Bulgogi, squid, and pork and it's all been very good! 

The noise level is average. On a weekday you'll find it pretty quiet but busy on Friday and Saturday nights. I really recommend this place if you're craving Korean food in the area!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved the pics of the food on the wall. Helps to choose what you want when you are not familiar with certain dishes. Nice array of choices on the menu and the food was good."}
{"text":"This place is very difficult to review. In one hand, the food has always been a delicious. The other hand, their service sucks. My enjoyment ALWAYS wanes by the end of my meal.  
They always eager to greet the customer and collect the payment. Everything else in between is MIA. I would appreciate if they would step up their game since competition has just arrive. 
Either way....meh"}
{"text":"If you're going to splurge this is the place. The portions are huge and the dishes are delicious. Lots of seating available. I split the bbq beef with a friend and we both had left overs to take home."}
{"text":"Great food with large portions. Terribly slow wait.

The two times I've come, (first time with a group of 4 and second with just 2), we've had to wait for at least 20-30 minutes for a table. The waitresses literally run because they are so understaffed, and tables sit uncleaned for a while.

However, the service is kind, although rushed, and they surprisingly come back to fill your water. The stews are really good, and the sides are quite diverse. I really like the army stew hotpot which can feed more than 2 people. The place is quite large and spacious. They also have multiple TVs showing sports and other shows.

There don't seem to be very many Korean options in the Phoenix area, so I will definitely come back here for the food, but expect to wait and don't expect amazing service."}

This is the \"new kid on the block\" and I wanted to see if it lived up to all the hype I had heard about it. Companion and I went for lunch, as we both are very fond of Korean food. On entering, we noticed quite a few people eating their lunch there - hopefully a good sign of food to come.

We were seated quickly, and given menus. Our server explained that they had only been open for several weeks and that many of the recipes were from the owner's family. 

After ordering soft drinks, we placed an order for dac bulgagi, which is a variant on the regular bulgagi in that it is made with chicken instead of beef. While we were waiting we were brought about ten banchan or appetizers that we could either snack on then or eat with the meal. We did a bit of snacking and saved the rest for the meal.

The banchan was excellent, and particular kudos for the kimchi, which is made in house. I could have easily finished several portions of it.

In due time, the main course arrived - a large platter heaping with steaming hot dac bulgagi. I've eaten this dish in many places and this was some of the best I have had the pleasure of eating. The sauce was obviously homemade.

It was hard to finish the pile of chicken, but we made a valiant effort and in the end took a small box with us. 

The owner visited our table to check on us and to let us know that these were his family's recipes. While we did not have room to eat another bite, the flavor and quality of the food will encourage me to visit again and try some other dishes.

4 stars for good service, good food, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"When I lived in L.A. I use to eat Korean BBQ at least once a week. I have been in AZ for 12 years and have been searching for a Korean BBQ restaurant as good as the one I use to go to and I have. The food here is so good and so is the service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So good it blew us away ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND ! Wonderful Atmosphere ! Awesome Staff !"}
{"text":"It was our first time here, and Korea Town was QUIET.  It was slightly after 1 pm, and for the 45 minutes that we were there, only four tables were occupied, about 12 people, or so.  (The International Market across the parking lot within the same complex was a ghost town; We later paid it our first visit, and Mom said she would not return to shop there.)  We were promptly greeted, given menus, and served ice water.  It was very chilly indoors, and after we placed our order, I returned to the car to retrieve a couple of sweaters to help keep us warm.

Mom had soup on her mind, since a coworker raved about finding \"very good pho across the street from Koreatown,\" and eventually settled on the Seafood Hot Tofu soup. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koreatown-mesa?select=cvxFOkXGbXl7PzLhxPoc3A  While finding it very tasty, with a couple of shrimp, a raw egg, and tiny chunks of chopped up scallops, she commented that it had too much tofu in it.  If we return, she'll try a bowl from the regular soup menu.  I decided to try the bulgogi rice bowl off of the lunch menui, which was described as just bulgogi on top of rice with some spring onions. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koreatown-mesa?select=LDIhxE2I-TndVGy1IsnmAg  It arrived with a fried vegetable roll and a mini gyoza.  I gave the egg roll to Mom, since it contained carrots (she said it was OK, but she wouldn't order it again as an appetizer), while I ate the gyoza.  Its pan-fried texture had a nice crisp to it.  Wish it was a bit bigger... TWSS.

As per tradition, banchan- a set of side dishes- accompanied our order. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koreatown-mesa?select=suhFYiN6LTAQrU-ZWUETmg  These small saucers contained beansprouts (good; a little bland, could've used some spice!), cubed potatoes (passable; Mom thought it had a gelatinous texture!; I didn't like its tepid temperature, nor its texture), pickled radishes (OK, nice crunch), seaweed salad (good, not too salty), fishcake (Mom said was good), kimchi (good, could've been a little fresher), spicy cucumber (beware- I thought it was zucchini, which I'm NOT allergic to, but it turned out to be cucumber, which I AM allergic to!  Too bad, because the slices had a nice spicy kick to them...), and pickled cucumber (Mom reached out for it once and didn't go back for a second taste).

Our server Sal was friendly, and later apologetic.  After I'd finished asking about the possibility of getting egg noodles on the side (no, but flour noodles are available, and did I want them in a broth?  So I asked \"What kind of broth do you have, because I'm allergic to seafood,\" and of course, it's the only kind of broth they serve here); whether I can get the bulgogi served on the side, and not on top of the rice- \"yes,\" and it arrived served on top of the rice; and what were the veggies that made up their banchan set (\"are these zucchini?\"), he apologized for not telling us what they were.  Oh, well.  I'm still alive, albeit wearing a long-sleeved thermal while sneezing and coughing in between sentences composing this review.

We may return, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"At first we were satisfied with how nice the staff was they promptly provided a menu and we gave our to go order and the waiter read it back to us and we again verified it was correct ... 1 beef bulgogi 1 beef bim bimbop and 1 order oxtail soup...all went smooth...1 hour later and a wrong order of food later oh and an hours drive later ... We get home to Maricopa and open the bag ... 2 beef bimbops (missing the red pepper paste; which everyone knows ties it together). And no bulgogi ...what!!!!! So I call and tell the guy who answers the phone he says 'oh, sorry'.... Crickets ....okay now I'm upset so I say 'what about the refund'... He acts surprised then places me on hold and I can hear him on the phone say to; I can only assume the manager 'you know those black girls that came in earlier with the to go order....'...what!!!! (That's a bit much)...I'm African American and beautiful at that..: after much of a hold he comes back to the phone says ' we'll refund the bulgogi, I think there was a mix up between u and the waiter when u told him what you wanted.... (3x) What!!!!!! ... That guy knew exactly what I wanted I am not know to Korean food or the culture I was offended ... I have a Korean sister whom when I told this too said one word .. Star Korean word for crazy.... How dare they place their mistake in me the customer , especially when there's a receipt to back it up that it was ordered and well understood ... Beware my fellow African Americans you might get treated like a degenerate when dining here ... On another note we had to go buy our own red pepper paste another five dollars to eat the bimbops... At least the oxtail soup came fully prepared ... Thad something I guess ...Signing off the 'Food Pirate....watch for my other undercover food blogs for a food spot near you!"}
{"text":"As far as authentic Korean food goes, this is my favorite place in the Phoenix area. In my experience, many \"Korean\" restaurants Americanize their food by making it very greasy -- not Koreatown. Their food is almost as good as that of my . I had Japchae and a kimchi pancake, both were delicious. However, I am rating this 4 starts because their service could use improvement  -- for instance, check on your guests and make sure their waters are topped off every once in a while!"}
{"text":"First timer today. Banchan was basic, galbi tang was better than average. Seafood udon was no good. Love the concept and was expecting better but results equals mehhhhh. Was a mix between a broth and a bokkum. I would have liked to see it a bit drier and more bokkum style. The seafood was a good portion though. Would probably go again and try the chicken galbi... I'm thinking this will be equal or less than Hodori which I found was the most decent Korean food around town."}
{"text":"This place offers an awesome variety of foods, including a vegetarian base in the tofu soup. There is something for everyone here. Helpful staff, good banchan options, and reasonable prices! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We shared the seafood hot pot.  It was enough for 4 people.  The food and sides were good.  I only wish they had more pictures on their menu for those of us not very familiar with Korean food.  I know this place must be good since we were the only non-Asians dinning there that evening."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family and the food is so amazing. This is the best Korean restaurant in AZ AND I CAN GUARANTEE IT!! 
The owners come out to greet us and made us these beautiful food. Please give them a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Somewhat hidden in a corner of the large corner plaza anchored by the new International Market.  Easy to miss if you're not looking for it.

Restaurant itself was clean.  No hostess so we waited until the young waitress led us to one of their many tables.

2 young servers managing the front.  Somewhat open kitchen with about 4 in the back.  Our waitress was nice, friendly and rushing around trying to take care of everything.  Waiter looked like he was just there and not knowing what to do.

We ordered.  Bulgogi, spicy pork belly, pork tofu soup and the Roe Soup.  Food started arriving, slowly, One by One.

Result?  All the dishes we ordered + the banchan (side dishes) were good.

There aren't too many Korean options around here and most have enough flaws that I wouldn't go.  But that seems to be changing with the expected opening of H Mart next year.


Decor:  4 Stars (Big and clean but looks unfinished)

Food:  4 Stars by Arizona standards (About a 3 if in CA or NY)

Service:  4 Stars (friendly and hardworking but they need better organization & management)"}
{"text":"My family and I loved this place it was clean with friendly staff! Everything we ate was so delicious and enjoying! I was a superstar with my family for making this suggestion and discovery! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"WTH! Run to this place now! Ridiculously tasty and authentic! Banchan - let's be honest, a lot of times maybe 2-3 of what's laid in front of you is yummy - I'm pretty sure I got full on all the little plates because they were all loaded with flavor and fresh! No joke, this is it - we will not be driving to Korea town 6 hours away to cure our craving for phenomenal Korean!

I'm full and I've already called dibs on left overs. We have the Beef Bulgolgi and Spicy Pork Belly!! 

Customer service is a plus! The waiter saw us digging into the squid and fish cake and brought out their \"raw squid and seaweed\" we tore into that like no ones business! Ugh! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I go to a restaurant or when I go shopping someplace I'll have a tune in my head but I'll substitute my own words for the original lyrics. Blame it on my musical upbringing. Today I had Funkytown by Lipps-Inc:

Won't you take me to... Koreatown!
Won't you take me to... Koreatown
(Cue string instruments)

Anyways, Koreatown is in the newly revitalized shopping center on Broadway Rd in the AZ International Market plaza. You can't miss the giant red letters if you are driving there on Broadway. We ate here for dinner tonight. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated with a relaxing atmosphere. 

We ordered the beef bulgolgi hot stone bimbimbap and a spicy chicken bulgolgi to share. While we waited for our main entrees our server presented us with a wide selection of banchan such as fish cake, marinated cucumber, kimchi, bean sprouts, and eggplant. My favorites of all of them were the cucumber and eggplant. The kimchi tasted mild and too sweet for my tastes.

The dishes came out and looked amazing. The hot stone bimbimbap smelled heavenly and had a sizzle that was music to my ears. I found it odd that the beef was hidden in a small mound underneath the sunny side up egg. Wouldn't you want to showcase your main meat in your dish? The bowl itself was colorful with lots of vegetables and pleasing to the eye though and the bits of caramelized rice at the bottom of the bowl are always one of my favorite parts of this meal. 

The spicy chicken was coated with a red pepper sauce with onions on top and bottom of the dish. Overall, both dishes were enjoyable, but I wish the bimbimbap had more rice to go with it, and the spicy chicken's taste was a little sweeter than what I've had at other Korean restaurants. I did like how a bowl of rice was automatically included with the spicy chicken plate. At other restaurants they charge by the bowl.

Prices for some items seemed a little higher for some dishes, such as the $29.99 casseroles (Meal for 2) but since I didn't order them they might be a ton of food for your money so I can't really pass too much judgement. I was disappointed that my $1.50 soda was not a fountain drink but by the can. I'll be getting iced tea or plain water next time!

I'll come here again if I'm in the area, especially if I'm also shopping at the international market. Overall 3.5/5."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and  I just left this place after waiting 20 minutes to be served. Our waitress sat us down, however after she did not come back. She sat down two other tables by us. She picked up their orders and provided them drinks. I'm not sure why she didn't ask us for our drink orders  or why she didn't serve us. She was not rude or unkind we were just simply forgotten after seated. It was not busy at the time we arrived. I was disappointed as I was very exited to try this new place. We decided to leave and we did let her know we were not satisfied. She apologized and offered to serve us then, but at that point we no longer felt comfortable. I will say I was the only Hispanic person in the restaurant and I felt like we were not being served because of that purpose. It made feel sad that would happen as this restaurant has such wonderful reviews by diverse people. :/"}
{"text":"I arrived on a Saturday afternoon and the whole parking lot was packed. The outside looks like a shady massage parlor, but the inside is wow beautiful. The wait for me to be seated too a while even though it wasn't that busy inside (the crowded parking must have been for somewhere else.). The waitress was very nice. I ordered the spicy stir fry squid, pomegranate soju, and water. The decor and waitresses are beautiful. The soju is pretty good. I liked the metal chopsticks and the side dishes of vegetables. The squid came out steaming hot with rice. The k-pop music in the atmosphere was satisfying. The squid was good and spicy, but not too spicy. Overall it was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My sister turned me on to this place and we go at least once a week.  Havent tried everything on the menu but working our way through the menu.  Love soup and never disappointed.  Always seems busy but service has always been perfect."}
{"text":"Incredible food, immaculately clean dining area/restrooms, and great service. What more could you want?

I had the kimchi hot stone veganized (i.e. no egg). Very generous portion of rice, vegetables, kimchi, spices, and oil. It came out boiling hot! If you can wait -and I know that's asking a lot- let the rice on the bottom crisp up a little from the hot stone before you eat. Scrape up those crispy rice pieces and savor it. The dish tastes better the longer you stir as well. Good thing chopsticks make you eat slower. They also have several Korean appetizers that they bring to your table. My favorite was the pickled cucumbers. 

I only tried one other dish at the table: kimchi cold noodles (Kimchi Bibim Guksu), which was also great. 

They ever brought us complimentary tiramisu cake! I didn't try it, but those that did, loved it. 

Highly recommend this place! I want more NOW!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple weeks ago (sorry for the delay in review!). The Galbi (short rib beef marinated) was ok. I will definitely have to come to this place again and try a different item on the menu. I enjoyed that the restaurant was large, clean, and children friendly."}
{"text":"I love the service and food. Especially, Korean soups and stews are good. 

But I will never recommend to order Korean Hoedeopbap(sushi and rice w spicy sauce). The restaurant doesn't know how to prep sashimi. Fish tasted awful.

Other than that I have tried 4 dishes and all of them were pretty good."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service. Very good food. The only thing that was so-so was the chicken katsu, but my friends and family lived the kimchee pancakes. They were thicker than I'm used to but very tasty. The kalbi was great. The ban chan was okay...not bad....not great, but they gave a lot of different choices and offered to refill them as needed. My hubby and friend loved the squid ban chan. We're from Hawaii where Asian cuisine is excellent, and my mother is from Korea so I've eaten some excellent Korean food. I'd say this is the best Korean place I've found in AZ so far!"}
{"text":"This place was better than expected. Restaurant is open and spacious and clean. Prompt service in ordering food. Got the Seafood tofu soup, Pork belly kimchi stir fry and kimchi pancakes. All were amazing and flavorful. There were lots of dishes this place offers that you don't see at all of the other local Korean restaurants. Will be coming back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Korean BBQ around town and this is by far the best. The galbi is amazing!

This is my go to for Korean bbq."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!! Ok, so I ended up visiting family and happened to drop by this place because they mentioned a new Korean restaurant opening up. I was curious to see if this Korean restaurant was any better than Micky D's of Korean food called Hodori. Being THAT Korean who was raised in Ktwn, LA(Cali) on Korean food like it was the only food in existence, it's hard not to be a food snob when it comes to Korean food. Personally, I think Hodori tweaks their flavors for people with limited taste palettes. That ish is mediocre but I guess dead taste buds don't know the real deal. 

The presentation of food is what threw me off. Never have I been to a Korean restaurant that actually took their time to make it presentable until now. Definitely left without feeling disappointed. Will be coming back when I visit again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the kimchi fried rice and hotpot. Clean, open dinning room. Korean game shows, music videos or soap operas on the tv."}
{"text":"Amazing, Authentic, Awesome! (AAA rating!) We ordered a sea food hot rice stone, a bulgogi hot rice stone, and a seafood tofu hot soup. All three were so tasty and would 100% order again. Huge portions on the rice stones! Literally so full right now. Great service and atmosphere at this place. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant operates in a very competitive restaurant area of town. On arrival I was seated promptly. I looked through the menu and decided on Bimbop. My waitress assisted me with the meat selection for my meal. My meal arrived very hot in a stone bowl. There were additional side dishes served with the meal. As I ate my meal not everything in my stone bowl appealed to me so I just pushed it to the side and continued enjoying the deliciousness of the food.  This restaurant has quite a sushi menu, and many patrons were enjoying sushi as I was eating. As the name suggests Korea Town, is very much about Korean food. Their menu is a reflection of the quality food served by the chefs. I'm glad that I enjoyed this meal this evening, and I would recommend that you try it soon too."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty.  Service lacked a little but they made up for it with great food.  The portions are huge so I recommend sharing with the table.  Gives you an opportunity to try several different items and still get stuffed."}
{"text":"The worst service restaurant! I ordered by phone and came to pick up tofu soup. I stood on waiting area for more than ten minutes and no waiters asked me anything. They all saw me but they did not come. Finally one guy came and told me that they ignored me because they were busy and they did not want to seat me. The best reason I ever heard!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a good Korean food this is the place I go. There staff is super friendly and their food is \"happiness in my mouth\""}
{"text":"Great Korean food which is a rare find in this part of Arizona. We had Galbi Bibimbap and Oxtail Soup. Both were divine. Atmosphere could be improved but for good Korean food, this is the place. I only wish they had tables where you can cook korean barbecue at the table!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and was seated immediately. Large and spacious spot for a restaurant. The waiter was super friendly and gave us recommendations on our first visit! My boyfriend and I shared a $20.99 large casserole pot of pork neck kimichi soup which is a huge portion for two people; we ended up taking leftovers home. The pork pieces were huge in the soup but has huge bones too making it a bit harder to eat. The soup itself was super tasty but I personally wasn't a fan of the unique veggie they had on top of the soup that tasted very floral. We had a bunch of side dishes that were complementary. Left super full and a real bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drink! Highly recommend and reasonable prices for the portions! I got the vegetarian mushroom soup (can't remember the exact name) but all of the food was amazing and already thinking about going again!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. It was my first time trying hotpot and was amazing. It was a lot of food. Enough for about 4 people. My wife and I ate as much as we could but we still ended up taking home leftovers. And the two of can eat A LOT. I liked that it came with kimchi and white rice. If they had kimchi as part of a buffet I would come to this place a lot."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere, and portion everything was good enough. I ordered seafood jeongol, tteok bok ee, and bossam. All the foods came out quickly, and the servers were very polite and on time. I will go back to restaurant soon"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat. The place was clean and they give you alot of food. It was really good."}
{"text":"Great new place for Korean BBQ. What I first loved about this place is how BIG the place was! Definitely was packed but the spaciousness of this place made it feel like everyone can be helped and they weren't overwhelmed. 

We went with a bunch of friends so we got bulgogi, the spicy pork (teji bilgogi?), all the side dishes (banchan), and my wife got bibimbap and my other friend got some kind of friend rice cause he's white. Everything was sooo awesome! The portions they give you are BIG! Everything tastes amazing, and even the fried rice that my white friend ordered lol, sorry cause I usually don't order fried rice at any Asian place was so tasty!!!! I stand corrected. Maybe I should order fried rice more! Lol 

The service was great too!!!! The only thing about this place was that it CAN get a little more pricey than its competitors like Gogi or Cho Dang. However I feel like he quality and portion sizes of this place is worth it!!!! Don't forget to ask for he purple rice, it's way better than the normal white rice they give you! I highly recommend this place to get your Korean fix on!"}
{"text":"Ordered : Seafood stir fry udon and spicy brisket soup with vegetables. The portions are big, the sauce bases are so flavorful. The udon noodles, oh my goodness. Udon noodles are fabulous!!! ( made absolutely perfect.)
 The food and service were both a 10! We came here before and forgot to leave a review. My partner and I looked at each other in shock! We lived in SF and had amazing Korean food and haven't had anything near as good since then... until now.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to try out Korean bbq. Food is always on point. Been here a few times and planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Didn't think I would ever find a place that had better traditional Korean food then Hodori but Koreatown has totally won me over.  The place is clean, nice ambiance, and the staff is very friendly and courteous.  The food is amazing, really enjoy their purple rice and their banchan is delicious!"}
{"text":"We are from New Jersey and regularly go into NYC to Koreatown and this is a good facsimile of those restaurants.  the free appetizers were a little disappointing, no whole fish, no seaweed salad and what's with the serving of commercial dried seaweed.  the portions are huge. my appetizer came out after the main course and the sauce completely overwhelmed the soft shelled crab. service was adequate.  ambience is a bit north Korean communal workers dinning hall. however give this place a try food is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for Korean food. The food is well-done and the portions are fair. Myself and a couple of friends had similiar experiences regarding a specific area of service. It has become a pattern that our food is forgotten and we have to remind the waiter/waitress about our order. This issue would be solved simply with the waiter/waitress reading the order back to the customer but we did not see them writing down or confirming the order. The dishes came out at different times which caused an awkward eating experience where my friend just watched me eat while waiting for a dish that should've come out 30 minutes ago. This incident did not happen with one waiter but it occurred amongst multiple visits. But otherwise, great and we will be back."}
{"text":"My BF and I tried this place out after seeing my sister come here few days ago.. This restaurant is very spacious .. Overall the food was pretty good.. I ordered the kimchi stew with pork belly which was delicious and satisfied my cravings.. My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken, it wasn't bad but had better at Hodori.. We did like the variety of side dishes they offered but my boyfriend was kinda disappointed that they didn't have the potato one.."}
{"text":"YUM! If you're a Korean food fan, you'll dig this place. Really good stuff. I suggest bringing a group of friends so you can all share your orders. 

I had the grilled mackerel and it was delicious. Kimchi and pickles are awesome, but not very spicy. So if you like your kimchi spicy you might be a tad disappointed."}
{"text":"Update: the food here is really good but the service is absolutely terrible. No one is up front to greet you when you come in and you are left looking around and wondering why no one has even said hi to you. It took over 20 minutes for our order to be taken and for us to get drinks. They messed up our order and we had to cancel it because we were all done eating before the correct order even came back out. The waitress was nice, but I would rather pay higher prices for better service. The owners need to change something here."}
{"text":"This place serves the best, most authentic Korean food I've ever had. The Spicy Pork Hot Stone was my favorite and really made the restaurant memorable, but the seafood soft tofu soup and the quality of the usual small Korean sides definitely helped. This restaurant is  a hidden gem in Mesa, and although the service wasn't always the best, the food MORE than made up for it. This place is absolutely worth a try, especially for those who have never truly tried authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some Korean food!! Finally found one that is relatively similar to LA Koreantown food!! This place is fabulous!! Started with their personally made mango soju which was tasty although original with Hite probably better...also had their Makgeolli which was not the green bottle one but still good...then had their short rib soup which was fantastic!! Their galbi bibibop was amazing!! Add the sauce!! Then had the spicy tofu kimchi soup...pretty good and then their seafood pancake was crunchy and salty...very food!! Very happy with the meal!! 4 stars compared to Ktown in LA but 5 stars here!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

It's pretty rare that I leave a restaurant feeling completely \"meh\" about the food, and unfortunately, this is one of those times.

I'll start with this.  The food here is not bad at all, and we will be back to try more things here, but in comparison to Korean food everywhere else - it's just not great.

Let's start with the ban chan.  8 dishes, each average at best.  They put a little extra seasoning on the dak kwang, the kimchi is fermented a little longer than your usual place, but it's all still pretty average.

Ordered the naeng myun and kalbi combo (kal naeng), and an order of the kalbi dolsot bibimbap.

The naeng myun was alright.  Had to ask for mustard and vinegar to doctor it up a little and even after that, noting special.  The kalbi on the side was pretty thick cut, not too sweet, but there was quite a bit of fat on them.  Also average.

The dolsot bibimbap's main annoyance is that they don't cut up the kalbi - it's left in big pieces on top which looks nice, but makes it harder to eat.  It seemed like you had to add a lot more of the gochu jang sauce here than at other places.  Also, in comparison to say, Hodori, where they give you an extra side bowl of soup, no extras here.

Again, nothing here was bad.  But nothing was amazing either.  We'll be back to try the gamja tang and compare it to Gogi and try some other stuff, but for what we had, just an average Korean meal."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and loved it! Service was awesome, restaurant was super clean, and food was delicious.......this will be added to my favorite list!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, ask for the bimibop they will make it special for you!!! Huge portions too!!! The dumplings were awesome and so was the plum wine and echigo beer was delicious too!!! Ask for Daniel as your server he was awesome."}
{"text":"First of all the food here is outstanding. If this was pick-up only it would be 5 stars. Tonight we came here for dinner as we've been here before atleast a half dozen times. Every single time the same story....outstanding food but lousy service. Once you order(it takes them a long time to come to you so when they do come for your drink order also order your meals at the time) you won't see the server come back to ask how you're doing, offer refills, or just a courtesy check up. I had to ask another server for a refill and guess what.....she never returned. Finally we were done eating and sat for 15 minutes before I grabbed someone there for our check. Just know before you go here the service sucks."}
{"text":"Very happy with the service tonight. The much anticipated  Koreatown has been open for a month! How did I not know this? After visiting Sonoran lights we were in the mood for Korean Tofu Soup. To our delight Koreatown was open .

 We ordered Kimchi Pancake and two orders of Korean tofu soup I ordered Mixed. The  Seafood tofu soup had small bits of shrimp and 1 or two mussels and clams. The hubs was hoping for more seafood but the flavor was nice.  My tofu soup was \"mixed\" but had the smallest sliver of beef.
 I would suggest going for seafood because mixed is a dollar  extra. 
 
Kimchi pancake came out on a large round metal pizza size plate. The kimchi pancake was good but I would prefer crispier. The sauce we didn't care for,  was VERY salty. Actually dipping the pancake in the tofu soup tasted better. 

Our waitress tonight was really great. We didn't get her name but kudos to her cause she was carrying all the trays and checking up tables. Also , the space was very clean and spacious and their AC was blasting which is nice for AZ.  
PS. ***Koreatown is better than Hodori. Happy there is a korean restaurant with NICE korean people and food!"}
{"text":"Although there are many seats inside?no waiter comes here to serve you. We just stand 15 minutes?together with other two guests. Although food is good here?but I will not come here anymore. Just donot want to be rude and say fuck?but this is not the way restaurant serve guests."}
{"text":"Spacious, well designed restaurant! This was my first time but my brother has dined here before. Loved the little apps, especially the daikon and potatoes. The server was kind enough to give us more. We ordered the Korean dumpling hot pot, spicy pork belly and hot stone bulgogi which had rice and mixed veggies as well. All dishes were very authentic and flavorable. My brother's favorite was the pork belly and it was pretty spicy but not overwhelming or painful. They also served white rice and purple rice which has more of a brown rice texture. 

Lots of leftovers to take home for future lunches and dinners and we will try this place again. We think it'll be good fro groups!"}
{"text":"Holy moly flavorful! Probably the most flavor I e had in a meal in a very long time! Our table ordered beef bulgolgi and spicy chicken bulgolgi, jap chae noodles, and the spicy chirashi bowl. Tons of food. But delicious. The meat was tender and marinated well. The noodles were the perfect addition to it. The chirashi bowl, wow!  I was shocked at how big the bowl was and there was so much sashimi! Well worth the price. 
We tried the purple rice, it was good. Not much different
Tasting than the white rice. 
Only downside is refills were slow. I never got a refill on my water. Then the side dishes they bring out was on the bare minimum side. We had a table of three and barely had 4 bites of each side. Wish they gave us more because I enjoy eating them with my meal."}
{"text":"This place is located on the international market plaza with plenty of parking. We were craving for jap chae and bulgogi. The jap chae came out warm and the bulgogi was inside a hot stone. Both were very tasty and filling for 2 people. Will have to try the Korean BBQ next time."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after passing it every day on my way to and from work!

I went with the relatively safe and tame option of seafood tofu soup. Now, I'm not a Korean food expert, but I thought it was pretty darn good. It was plenty flavorful, and they definitely don't skimp on the seafood (yay!). I got mine at a mild because I'm a wuss, and it was a solid choice. Not too spicy but not completely spice-less. You get all the small side dishes with your meal, and they were also pretty good. Loved the yellow pickled radish and the kimchi, which was a little more \"mellow\" in taste than most kimchi I've had.

I came around 1:30, and it wasn't busy - 5 parties max. The service was fast and very friendly, and the restaurant and bathrooms were clean. They have a sign in the front for lunch rice bowls and other specials, all of which sounded delicious.

One last comment - the place is freezing! I almost ran back out to grab a sweater, but my food came out before I could. The soup warmed me up haha

All in all, I would back to try some of the other stuff. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Come on your birthday - get a $0.01 bottle of champagne. What kind of champagne? Does your liver even care at this point, slam that no-name baby down!

This place has become one of my favorites and at this point, it might top Hodori which is saying a lot. The place is bigger and cleaner than all the Korean bbqs in Arizona and everyone here speaks perfect English so that the majority of my friends aren't as intimidated when they try to decipher the menu. Before you take a seat, make sure to take a look at their specials on the menu. It's probably the one thing that differentiates them from other places since they have specials like octopus, noodles, different types of desserts, etc. The portion sizes are on par with everyone else (maybe not the galbi) but everything has always come out fast, hot and so delicious that I can't complain. Also, it's pretty much mandatory that you have alcohol with Korean bbq so if it's not your birthday, ask for the flavored soju. Our server recommended grapefruit and dear lord, that stuff goes down like Capri-Sun. It is amazing and you'll be in such a fantastic mood that you won't even realize that you've stayed past closing and now you're mildly slow and happy yet confused because the servers are now begging you to leave. Whoops. 

To be honest, all the Korean food in AZ tastes the same. They all use similar marinades and have pretty much the same menus so if someone was to recommend you a place, it would more than likely be based on service and environment so I definitely recommend this place, especially for first timers! Koreatown is daebak, at least for Arizona standards."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Incredibly spacious and clean atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food. 

Koreatown serves large portions of super flavorful Korean dishes. Each meal comes with banchan (small plates of various items like kimchis and pickled veggies) so you get a little extra bang for your buck. 

I got the veggie dolsot bibimbap in the hot stone bowl. I love how the rice continues to cook as you eat and gets delightfully crispy! Fiancé got the kimchi fried rice and couldn't stop raving. 

We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! all of the food I've tried so far has been amazing and the service is great. high quality with low prices and I can't wait to go back for more"}
{"text":"Updated review! I was nearby and I was craving Korean. I decided to give you guys a second chance. Boy I'm glad I did! I had the galbi and seafood tofu soup. Delicious! The galbi was flavorful and soft just how like my Korean BBQ. The seafood tofu soup was perfect, I ordered mild I didn't want it too spicy. It was everything I imagined how it's supposed to taste. It came with one small fried fish. Yes the fish was soft on the inside and crunchy on the out. Not too salty neither. My server gave me white rice, I told him I ordered purple. He took the white rice and said Oh you wanted purple? You got it. I'm glad we got the right servers this time.. I had 3 different servers all were very nice and checked on me. I dropped my chopstick and my lady server seen or heard and handed me a new one right away. Guys I just wished you could have done this for my birthday when I had dinner with my family here. Well tonight you guys did an awesome job. Please keep up the good work. I would love to be your regular again!"}
{"text":"FIVE stars for the food, TWO stars for the service, THREE stars for the ambiance (which I'm actually giving very little weight to in my overall rating).

The Bulgogi hot stone really was perfection... and easily two meals (even for the hungriest Mike)!

Sides included kimchee, fresh broccoli, and seaweed salad (as well as a handful of other items) and all were VERY good (which I typically cannot state for most Korean restaurants that I have been to).

My ONLY problem with Koreatown was the service (or lack thereof).  Maybe we just arrived at a time when they were understaffed... or maybe they just don't care about actually seating and serving customers... but we literally stood at the host area for ten minutes without anyone ever coming up to say hi or tell us it would be a moment or anything.  I could even overlook that if they did not have such an open floor plan where it was evident that servers and other employees in the kitchen made repeated eye contact with us, but yet still ignored us.  And another larger party walked in about five minutes after us and they were commenting on how long THEY were waiting.  We could only laugh because we had already been waiting so long.  It's really not acceptable for this to happen.  If the \"host\" was not in (or maybe was in the bathroom), then someone else (anyone else, really), just needs to come over, make us feel welcomed, and at the very least get us in the queue to be seated.  

And then after we were seated, we waiting at least another five minutes before a server came over to us.  I wanted to just order immediately at that point because we had no idea how long it would take to see our server again after that.

Our dishes came out about twelve minutes after ordered them... which is totally acceptable, but that initial wait was almost unbearable.

I am glad we waited because the food was so good... and I will probably be back because of that one reason... but this dining experience could have been SOOO much better.

***THREE STARS***"}
{"text":"My family and I went out to celebrate last night and this place came through. Service was on point, food was delicious and they made all my Korean favorites even better than I have ever had. Soon Do Bu was served boiling hot, raw egg cooking on top, and the most perfect fried fish on the side. Stir fried kimchi and pork and the galbi were so good, I can't wait to go back. Plus the soju mixes were fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is good here. Side dishes not so much. I do like the space and the restaurant feels clean. Their tofu soup is yummy :)"}
{"text":"The lunch special Spicy Pork Bulgogi was awesome!  Plenty of kimchi.  The price was great too!"}
{"text":"I've tried at least three other Korean places in the area and after going to this one, this is the only one I now go to. Their book August very good and there Japanese style tempura is really good, and theit soon is also good ( chili tofu soup)."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 4.5 stars.  I had a good experience and my food was delish.  I got the kalbi bi bim bap, and it was excellent.  My server was on his first day, admittedly, so the service was not perfect.  However he was friendly, and as helpful as he could be.  I agree with others that the food is a little better priced than Hodori.  It also appears cleaner and I prefer this restaurant.  I will definitely go back!

Update:  7/16/16
Went back and tried the kalbi and bulgolgi.  These were excellent and the service was adequate.  Server was helpful and eager to refill our side dishes.  I prefer Koreatown over other local places including Hodori."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally checked this place out after passing by it many times, and hanging out at the Aseana Market and Hodori.  This place is much more modern, and Westernized, compared to Hodori.  That is not bad, as it actually has a nice decor.  

As far as the food, my wife ordered spicy chicken hot stone pot, and I ordered seafood hot stone pot.  In perhaps a more standard Korean setting, these would be called different versions of bibimbap.  I would say once you get over the Westernized, and less traditional look, you will find the food quality and price to be pretty good.  

It is worth noting that you should take your appetite with you when you go.  The portion sizes can be a bit huge, which is why even with two $$ I still call it reasonable.  If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you will have limited choices, though perhaps there are some.  

Yes, you can get food that has a real kick as far as spiciness, but the staff will work with you.  

What was particularly good was that my wife's teenage nephew, from Vietnam, only been in the USA for less then two months, who was with us, actually was able to eat the seafood hot stone plate.  He can be particular at times as to what food he eats.  The fact that he ate it, and it was not Vietnamese style, means that it was probably pretty darn good.  He found the food to be good, and even wanted to order something to take home.  This tells you something about the food!!!  

few things worth mentioning, and some are repeated:

1) If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you will unfortunately have limited choices
2) If you are looking for traditional Korean, it is there, but the food has a bit of a modern and Westernized twist.  It is done tastefully though.  
3) The portion sizes are a bit big.  Come with an appetite
4) If you order something like the seafood hot stone plate, it will be slightly bland if you do not add the appropriate condiment sauce.  Not everything is Korean chilli hot!!!  Of course, respect the notation, when it indicates hot and spicy."}
{"text":"Food: Yum!!
Price: Worth it
Service: They're nice. 

Food: Their food taste great every time I order from there. 

Price: The price of their food is worth the amount ur getting. Just ordering one item is pretty fulfilling with the amount you get.

--Tip: Ordering three things on the menu is enough to feed two people. My friend and I normally order a tofu soup for ourselves and an appetizer or an entree most of the time and we go home stuffed!

Service: The service there are nice. They don't come by that often to check on you but they will fill ur water when they see its low. 

Overall: I really like it here. Great food, great price, will definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I'm certainly no expert on Korean food, but koreatown is on par with the best I've had. They've only been open a short time and I've already been there four times. I've tried a different meal each time and enjoyed them all (though for a somewhat uncoordinated American trying to eat oxtail with chopsticks and a spoon was a challenge). Food has tasted fresh and high quality every time and I really liked the variety of their sides too. Staff has been very friendly and done an excellent job each time as well. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I have been to Koreatown about 7 times, whether for lunch in or for take out. It has been consistantly delicious each time! I actually had never eaten in a Korean restaurant before coming here, just had my Korean aunt's cooking, but I am glad I went in the first time. I love the beef bulgogi, and we try at least one new dish every time. It has all been good!"}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars because when we walked in, 2 servers saw us but didn't say hello or wait to be seated...the owner lady saw me from the kitchen but didn't bother yo let the servers know customer is waiting at the entrance.

I said out loud...\"do I wait for someone or can I seatyself?\" One of the server responded, hold on a minute.

Food was average. There were alot of side dishes but non that was good enough to ask for more or pick at with our meal. It's a first that anywhere would put pork belly in soondae soup....that was kinda weird.
Place is very open & greatly set but definitely could use more up beat servers & customer focused."}
{"text":"Thought I give them another try since its been awhile since they opened. I was glad I did. The service was excellent.
We ordered pork bone potato stew and it was delicious. The broth had deep flavor difficult to duplicate at home. They added kimchee to the stew which I thought was interesting. However, still had to take a star away due to missing potatoes. Not sure why they were missing, but it would've made the stew so much better. Other items ordered were pork belly lettuce wrap, bulgogi and kimchee pancake. All were tasty. They made improvement on service and food since they opened. The prices are very reasonable; huge portions. Give them a try."}
{"text":"People who love fiery food have been dubbed pyro-gourmaniacs.  I guess that's me.

I'm loving the Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps here.  Give me that boiled pork belly, the salted napa cabbage, the salted shrimp paste, and the radish salad any day and I'll be a very happy girl! Wash it down with some soju and I'm ready to punch the day in the neck! I almost wish they gave out whole cloves of garlic instead of slivers but I suppose you can always ask for more. Also on the spectrum of tastiness, I forgot the exact name but it's also listed under \"Specialty Entrées\" on the menu is the something-glazed salmon. It's in a sweet and slightly spicy (more mild than anything) sauce. The salmon and accompanying daikon is cooked to perfection. I do wish the skin stayed crispy for a contrast in texture as it gets incredibly soggy while bathing in the glaze sauce but it's not bad. I recommend eating your meal with the purple rice as its better for you! The banchan served is standard as well. 

Prices are decent, portions are good, the place is spacious and clean, and service is wonderful.  I'll definitely be back again.  I want that Seafood Hot Pot!"}
{"text":"The space is open and clean. Very clean. The service was also great! Very attentive but not bothering with too many visits. 

 Now to the important part, food. We had the spicy pork belly, a chicken soup, and the soft shell crab appetizer. The pork came with all of the fun Korean side dishes! They add a lot to your meal as you eat them with your meat and rice they can subtly change the tastes and make each bite a new and refreshing adventure. They are also unlimited refills so careful not to eat so many you can't finish your meal! (Or do if you're looking for leftovers.) the chicken soup was a bit underwhelming compared to the main dish we had, but it was still good. And the soft shell crab appetizer was perfectly done and crisp.

Next time I'll have to try the hot pot!"}
{"text":"Would have been 3 stars if the service wasn't so rude. The staff didn't greet us... which okay, that's fine. But our server also looked as if he was in a bad mood, just tossed the menus on the table, and did not come by after our food arrived to refill our side dishes/water or ask us about our food.
We got the spicy pork hot pot (bibimbap) and pork tofu soup (spicy level hot). The accompanying side dishes were bland, nothing special. A small fried fish came with the tofu soup, which was nice... but not enough to make up for the bland tofu soup and the super fatty pork belly in the soup. The bibimbap was decent and vegetable variety was a plus.
We usually go to another Korean restaurant in Mesa, but decided to try Koreatown because of the good reviews. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was really impressed during my first visit here. I checked out the newly-opened AZ International Market in the same plaza and thought I'd stop by after seeing the sign. HUGE portions of meat, seafood, noodles, and side-dishes. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything is good here! Go and try it! The space is nice and clean. Friendly staff, then exterior is a mall but don't be afraid to walk in because you won't regret it:) I usually get the marinated pork!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered Koreatown, and I am very glad I did. The food is fantastic, the restaurant is very clean, and the service is friendly and helpful. After having rediscovered Korean food a few years ago, I have gone to several other Korean restaurants in the East Valley. Koreatown is better than all of them. The banchan are fresh and plentiful, and the bbq hot stone bowls are the best I have had in recent memory. The prices are competitive with other Korean restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Today is our first time at this place.  It is very spacious inside, clean, nice decor and lots of TVs.  Expediency of service  was not an issue as we arrived at 5:00pm on a Tuesday and we were the only party at the time.  We ordered Cod Roe Soup, Pork Belly Lettuce Wrap, Beef Fried Rice and Calamari.  Overall the food dishes were decent to good.  Banchan side dishes were good but too sparse.  Calamari was excellent.  Cod Roe Soup was flavorful but not spicy enough for my taste and portion is smaller to other places in town considering the cost.  Fried rice was good and beef was cooked perfectly.  Pork belly lettuce wrap was tasty and good but we ran out of lettuce before pork belly, side stuff that came with this dish also ran out before pork belly.  We specially asked for purple rice but got none, waitress either completely forgot or jus didn't hear us...it's wasn't like they were busy.  Overall, I give this place 3 1/2 stars but took away half for not getting purple rice.  I may come back at some point to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I love that we're getting so many more Korean restaurants in the valley! I came here with some friends to check them out and they're located in a pretty good spot in Mesa in a new Asian plaza. The restaurant is pretty big and spacious which was nice because I hate sitting at a restaurant where another table is so close they can pretty much be part of your party. They had a good selection of food and they give you a ton of banchan (side dishes). I got the yookgaejang which is a shredded beef, spicy soup. It was spicy and had good flavor and seasoned well. The meat was really tender and it was probably one of the best yookgaejangs I've had in the valley. My friend got this fish roe soup and that was also really good and had good flavor. All of their soups were really good and I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a Korean restaurant in Mesa."}
{"text":"I'm beyond excited about this new restaurant. It's spacious, with an open kitchen concept. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful. The food.. Oh glorious food. I ordered the pork belly and squid on hot plate. The flavor was similar to that of the Vietnamese caramelized pork belly, only richer. It's a comfort food dish for sure. Next up is the spicy chicken. The heat gets to you about 3 bites in, but it doesn't get to overwhelmingly hot. It was just the right amount of heat. Saving the best for last, I give you the caviar bowl. If you eat with your eyes, then this bowl is a crowd pleaser for sure. It's stunningly beautiful, healthy, and beyond delicious. All dishes are prepared in the kitchen, so you can just sit back and enjoy.  A great addition to the Mesa food scene. Bon appetit!!!"}
{"text":"With a name like 'Koreatown' you are sending a message that you are the creme de la creme.  It means you are the total package of Korean cuisine.  From our first experience here, I'm not quite sure if that is true.  The menu was quite extensive from my last recollection.  Not everything I've tried at other Korean joints were on here.  With that said, we opted based on our guts and feeling.

The item I personally enjoyed was their exceptionally good Beef Short Rib soup.  There were approximately 4 pieces of chunky Beef Short Ribs.  It was cooked perfectly tender.  When you can sink your teeth into the meat without fuss, you are on your way to meat heaven.  The broth had a nice balance of sweet and savory.  The glass noodles were cooked perfectly.  The pairing of the meat, the noodles and broth was in sync.  In conclusion, order this, I saved you from reading another review.

 The other important element about eating at a Korean establishment is anticipating the petri looking dishes filled with 'banchan' or side dish.  For the most part, not much to complain about.  It was satisfying to say the least.  I love eating my main dish along with these 'banchans.'  In some ways, it helps cleanse your palate while at the same time enhance the main dish.  

The interior decor is quite modern with a very spacious dining area.  Its very clean and polished.  The staff is super friendly.  They can help steer your taste buds in the right direction if necessary.  Otherwise, Have a Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I would be in huge trouble if this place was close to our home.  Instead, it's a good 30-45 minute drive and we've been there 4 times since it's opening.  The service is always amazing.  We always get the same girl...I think her name is Kim.  She's so friendly, attentive and quick.  The food is delicious!!  Our favorite is the sweet pork belly and their tofu soups.  We tried the seafood pancake with my in-laws when they visited and I was not a fan of that.  Way too much dough or something.  It was just really off.  Hubs wants to try their army soups sometime but I don't eat spicy food and he insists that it needs to be a spicy dish.  Any takers to eat that with him? :)"}
{"text":"I was very indecisive on what to order. I asked the server what was the seafood in the seafood hot stone and she tells me that it's scallops shrimp and squid. When I received the food, I notice that it was shrimp and squid. I try to look for the scallop and it was not there. I was disappointed because I ordered it because I wanted the scallops. I told the server that there were no scallops in my food and she said she will go back and check. She comes back later telling me that they do not have scallops and if I wanted more shrimp or squid. Ok... I should've been told this earlier. So I was disappointed and I was like it's fine. I go to mix up my food and I notice that the rice on the bottom is very hard. It's not like fried rice hard. It's like the rice that gets stuck on the rice scooper and you leave it on for a day. Literally that hard. At this point I am already getting real frustrated. There were no scallops and I wasn't told before I ordered it. The rice is un-eatable. The shrimp and squid is like boiled. No sauce in the dish. So I wanted to change the food. The server tells me that the hard rice is the concept of this dish... BUT WHO IN THE WORLD CAN EAT THIS TYPE OF RICE? It's harder than chips. It's like eating egg shells.... I do have the say the server is really nice and was very helpful on offering to change the dish. I ordered the tofu soup with oysters. The soup was good. It came with rice and a small fried fish. The fish was good and crispy. Their portions are big. One thing I like about this place is that their service is really good. The other food were really good as well. The seafood hot stone was just not my thing. I was not able to take a picture of my other food."}
{"text":"Yum! Not much more to say that other reviewers didn't. Service was quick server was sweet and answered questions with a smile. I had vegetable bibimap yum! There sides were pretty tasty too! I will be back"}
{"text":"Since I was doing grocery shopping nearby and most of my friends were here for lunch or dinner at least once, I figured it was time for me to give it a try. 

I was amazed of how spacious and clean the restaurant is. I even saw a waitress and cooks who look familiar to me. Apparently, the owner of this restaurant used to be a co-owner of GoGi Korean restaurant located in Chandler. Ah....my expectation is very high now. 

They offered Kim Chi in different varieties....much more choices than many other ones ive been to. For appetizer, we ordered dumplings. For entree, we got Kim Chi hot stone rice and Kaibi. Dumpling tastes similar to the one I've had during my travel in Korea. Kaibi (BBQ ribs) was delicious. The meat was tender and juicy. Portion was generous. The Kim chi hot stone isn't as tasty as I thought it would be...not sure what exactly was missing. 

Nevertheless, I will most definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"What a gem! This place was delicious. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but you walk in and it's like that scene in Wizard of Oz when everything turns to color... But add the delicious sent of bbq beef and pork in the air! We had sweet pork belly, bulgogi hot stone thingy and Korean dumplings. Of course that came with the little bowls of appetizers, which ended up being a ridiculous amount of food...that we destroyed! Our waiter was great. He was attentive and helpful since we weren't Korean food experts. We will 100% be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while and have recommended it to friends and family. The service was rough the 2nd to last time (my birthday dinner), but I let it go. I went again on Saturday morning with my sister (bringing new customers, as usual.) I ordered the spicy Korean chirashi, which I order every time. When I got it, the bowl was full of mixed greens and a couple of pieces of sashimi. I thought more must have been in there, but there was not. I asked the waitress who talked to the chef, who relayed to her that it is the same amount he always puts in. I explained how I come all the time and I'd never received the dish with less than half of the amount of sashimi. She said she couldn't do anything about it (which is not her fault!) There was an opportunity to resolve this situation and it was not. We got my sister's order to go and left. I will not be bringing my friends or family here anymore, nor recommending it to anyone. I will miss going to Koreatown."}
