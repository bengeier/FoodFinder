{"text":"Despite having large speakers, no music. This creates an eerily quiet atmosphere. The barrista, if you can call him that, gave some serious 'tude. Couches felt weird. Coffee was hot, but that's about it. Wallpaper was atrocious and dated. No splendia, sorry diabetics, bring your insulin. If you like grim on the floor, this might be the place for you. *eye roll*"}
{"text":"Very overpriced and not great food. Extremely disappointed. I'd rather walk the extra block and stand in line for Tim Hortons. I wanted to help the independent franchisee but with these prices - it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"Waren Frühstücken: Gutes Essen, niedriger Preis, grosse Teeauswahl, für uns hat alles gepaast"}
{"text":"Currently visiting Toronto and staying in the Yonge/Bloor area and looking for a good croissant place. Had a plain croissant and was pretty disappointed. Coffee was decent and there is free wifi but if you're seeking a great croissant then skip this place. I found the croissants at saint lawrence market much better particularly the ones on the main floor - future bakery?"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from The Croissant Tree, and they have great lunch/salad/panini options that are healthy, tasty and affordable. They also have free wifi that you can use without being hassled for staying too long. I really love their small selection of fresh juice as well. It is never too crowded, and has a patio on Charles Street that is well used when the weather is nice. Although it has more of a coffee-shop  vibe about it, they even serve alcohol if you are there for lunch and want a drink.  My only qualm is that they close too early or I would get their food for takeaway for dinner a lot more often!"}
{"text":"This place is great - came here on a weekend away and had a great eggs benny for under $10, including coffee!  Good other selections too (waffles, omlettes etc).  Coffee selection was perfectly adequate.  We came back a second time the next day.  This place is seriously good value and basically just what you need when you don't want to pay $30 for a crappy hotel breakfast."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant at a great location. Came here for a late lunch, though I regret not going there in the morning since they've got $1 croissants.    Seating indoors is plentiful and they also have a pretty decent sized patio which makes it great for big groups  The menu had quite an extensive selection of sandwiches. I got the grilled cheese with tomato with a side of sun-dried tomato pasta salad, for just under $8.  The sandwich: It had loads more tomato than cheese which was disappointing but overall it was a pretty decent sandwich. What was nice about it was that it was made using a panini press as opposed to being fried, which made for a much healthier grilled cheese.  The salad - Also had olives and red peppers as well as sun dried tomatoes. I would've personally preferred more sun dried tomato pieces rather than red peppers and olives, but it was still tasty.  The Croissant Tree place doesn't seem to offer freshly made non caffeinated drinks, which is a bit of a disappointment, although they do have a bar.   And wifi!  I wouldn't be opposed to eating at this place again."}
{"text":"Superb place to eat on a slow weekend morning. Excellent prices, warm environment, superb and friendly service. They even have Internet should you need it, no cost. Excellent breakfasts, quiet, centrally located , just a highly recommended restaurant to visit and often!"}
{"text":"Came here recently and ordered eggs, toast, potatoes, bacon, and tea. In all honesty the food was pretty gross and that is something I have never said about breakfast. The eggs were slimy, cooked over hard (I ordered over easy) and were a grey color on the underside. The potatoes were flavorless. The bacon, toast, and tea were fine fortunately. The space here is great for hanging out and working so I may come back for just a tea, but I certainly won't be ordering any meals here again especially since it wasn't exactly cheap."}
{"text":"Environment: This place just had a complete makeover! it's looks really nice and modern now ( with comfy sofas and couches!)   Food: Honestly, I use to think their croissants aren't so great BUT now I LUV their croissants! I think they changed their recipe or something...when I go get one in the morning, they are still hot~ fresh out of the oven & they taste sooo good. Their Breakfast menu is pretty good too...love that I can choose a variety of salads for my sides.   Price: I think their prices are pretty reasonable..the portions are pretty big.  ALSO, +1 for having Free WI-FI access so that i can use my laptop there"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast right across the street from my hotel very convenient. This place has got better over the years I've watched the Asian guy here grow into his business he's really cool guy too. Anyway they have good coffee and fresh croissants my favorite is the grilled chick en avocado sandwich on multi grain. This place would have got about a 2 a few years ago now it's a 4."}
{"text":"Compared to the vegetarian omelette I'd had in the hotel restaurant the day before, the omelette at The Croissant Tree was impossibly fluffy and full of fresh cut vegetables; the potato chunk fries were golden and delicious; and the coffee was spectacular. I think this speaks more about the horrible hotel food than what the Croissant Tree presented, which was all very nice and promptly served by friendly people. The tomatoes and peppers were large enough to dominate the omelette, but also too big to \"fit\" in the omelette, with no chance of making sense on a fork. But the taste was good, even if my ability to engineer the food was subpar. Another day I had their fruit salad and it was great."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for breakfast! +friendly staff. +delicious, and inexpensive, food. I have been here 5-10 times and everything I have tried is great + fairly wide selection of food, from breakfast to the salad bar + I like that they have a water cooler & water for everyone to take. + lots of selection at the coffee bar + very cool look to the place, with couches, etc + free wi-fi! + very nice outdoor seating area for nice summer days + consistently very good. This is a favorite breakfast spot of mine. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I will open this review with an angry glare. If you have seen that episode of How I met Your Mother where Lily has that \"You're dead to me look\", that is totally the look I'm going for. Specifically, when the bodega dude messes up her coffee.  The Croissant Tree to me is that  bodega...if the bodega was a dimly lit, dingy establishment with stale croissants and a way-overpriced breakfast.  I strolled into Croissant Tree with my beloved Yelp thermos. I love my thermos. It brings me all kinds joy and reminds me that there is a whole lot of eating and Yelping to do.  I ask Mr.Grumpy-Coffee Man if he could fill my thermos. He insisted that he charge me for a large. Dude, it's totally not a large.  After arguing for awhile, instead of easily winning a repeat customer, he made me really mad.  I left with my empty mug.  I keep telling myself I will buy a large cup of coffee and show him by attempting to pour that cup into the thermos, that the thermos is actually a medium.  You know who charges me the price for a medium coffee and gives me a discount for having a mug? Good ol' Tim Horton's, around the corner. Also there's Starbucks, around the corner. Or even Java Joe's a block away.  I shake my fist at you, Croissant Tree."}
{"text":"Awesome deli with a full breakfast menu and great salads. This was located right outside my hotel in Toronto. The prices were really reasonable for a downtown spot.  Grab a coffee and a salad, and settle in next to the windows to watch the Toronto sidewalk traffic pass by."}
{"text":"Like the previous review said, they didn't open at the hours indicated (7:35am on a Thursday).  To be honest, I don't want to give any rating without trying their food, but Yelp didn't give me that option."}
{"text":"This simple lunch cafe has a wide selection of sandwiches and salads for affordable prices, with daily lunch specials that combine a sandwich and a side of soup, salad, or fries. My grilled cheese met expectations - lots of cheese (cheddar only) and nicely grilled bread off the panini press. The soup is nothing to rave about but acceptable given their main focus appears to me sandwiches and salads. There was a wide selection of both pasta and green salad available for the day. Coffee and water were self-serve style, which sped up the ordering line. Couches, bar stools, and group tables were available."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you're in a rush and want to grab a quick bite to eat.  It's got a cafeteria style setting and the menu is fairly large.  You can grab the quick sandwiches or wraps to go, or order something to take out as well.  There is an all day breakfast menu that has various types of croissants and bagel combinations, which all taste great.  If you staying to dine in, there are plenty of seats and a nice couch area.  They also have free wifi and it's fairly quiet inside.  Similar to your typical cafe setting, this place is a great one to study or write that book you've been wanting to all these years!  Overall the food is nothing out of the ordinary, but it tastes great and is relatively inexpensive compared to other places in the area.  I'll come back for a bite whenever I'm in the area and need a breakfast kick starter."}
{"text":"Cute place to grab lunch or coffee with a friend. They don't play music too loud so it's also the best place to study or get some work done. The people in the front are super sweet and kind.   The food is okay. I got a specialty sandwich. It was pretty plain and didn't wow me. The coffee wasn't too bad either. I thought the prices were high but I assumed it was pretty normal for the area. The sandwich was about 10$, coffee about 4$.   I went in about 2 pm, and there wasn't too many people so I guess it's not usually packed. They had about 3-4 vegetarian options that I could spot."}
{"text":"This is a place with a lot of potential, that really falls short.    It's in a great location, big space...lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  They have a varied menu, lots to choose from.  BUT...  A couple times I've gotten coffee from there, it's had a lingering hazelnut or other flavored coffee taste.  Someone is obviously not washing out the carafs properly.  The croissant I got from there was tasteless (yes! at the CROISSANT tree...)  Though they have free wifi and a lot of seating, they blare unbearable music about half the time.  Really loud cheesy pop music..not exactly conducive to a relaxing afternoon studying or reading.  All and all, I'd say pass on this place.  Maybe it will improve, but for now, it's just sub-par."}
{"text":"Really great place to grab breakfast and just down the street from one of my friend's place! Every time I go over, that's where I gravitate to have breakfast. They have a wonderful selection of steeped teas and of course, their croissants are amazing. Definitely recommend if you're in the Yonge and Church intersection area, and its only a few minutes walk from Bloor-Yonge Subway station."}
{"text":"The Croissant Tree seems to be a bit hit-or-miss for me.   First, they've got a huge (almost too big) selection of food. I couldn't tell where to begin when faced with the decision of what to order.   Second, I've been here twice, and the first time the food quality was amazing and fresh. The potatoes (fries) were crispy and hot. The second time, I could tell the potatoes had been re-heated, they were lukewarm, and were almost grey in colour.   Third, the coffee selection is great! I'm not sure if it's bottomless coffee, but I was impressed with the selection.   Overall, I would say try it out and see what you think. I really enjoy the eggs benedict, croissants, and the coffee!"}
{"text":"Why come here: you work/live in this area and want \"fancy breakfasts\" for under $10.  Why you shouldn't come here: you want extremely good coffee (better options around the area).  I'm on a quest to find the best value breakfast in the Yonge/Bloor/Yorkville area.   Atmosphere: Like a high end coffee shop and has Wi-Fi and CP24.  Has a patio.  Pretty nice and seems good for meeting up with clients or friends during business hours. 4.5/5  Service: order at counter and they bring food to you. Not bad.  They should have those buzzer things like Panera.  3/5  Food: I ordered the peameal bacon eggs benedict and it came with home fries and vinegarette salad.  Eggs benedict were pretty good, peameal bacon had a decent salty taste to it.  I liked it.  Home fries tasted like they were out of a bag.  However I really liked the salad.  Ingredients were very fresh.  Coffee was average, but overall, great breakfast to start the day. They also have a good coffee selection if you're picky about coffee flavours.  So 4/5 on food.  Would I visit again? Yes, maybe once every few weeks for breakfast. I will have to try lunch from there too."}
{"text":"Great comfy food. Frequent choice for a nice hearty lunch choice. Their hot food chalkboard menu is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is only decent.. The price is nice and cheap but the food quality is what you pay for."}
{"text":"What I like the most is how spacious and quiet this place is for a workday lunch. We came here on a Thursday around 12:30pm. I think it is partly due to the fact that the restaurant is within an office looking building, and most people would not recognize it as a restaurant if they just pass by.    The smoked salmon benedict was well made with fresh ingredients. The meal came with a drink of your choice (coffee/tea/soft drink/juice)."}
{"text":"Bored of the neighbourhood lunch options, I stopped in after seeing sign outside advertising the special of the day, a pulled pork sandwich with fries for $7.95. Given my unofficial quest to eat every pulled pork sandwich in Toronto, I gave it a try. It was actually good and satisfying with a really sweet barbecue sauce surrounding the shredded pork between the panini bun. While not memorable, I was pleased for an impromptu take out sandwich.  I've been to other Croissant Tree's and was never really enthused with my experience, but this location seem especially inviting. Really open and spacious interior with tall ceilings and lots of windows. Lots of seating and what looked like a decent patio on the side as well. They even serve booze, which I didnt notice in the one down south of King St that I visited last.  My only complaint was my side dish. I ordered french fries, as they seemed like the standard compliment to my pulled pork sandwich. Unfortunately while looking good, I'm not sure if the oil they used was old or used to cook lots of different things in it, but the fries had a weird taste to them. And its funny because while I was waiting for it to be all to be prepared (I got take out), I was staring at the salad bar of crazy good looking mediterranean pasta salads, quinoa salads, caesar salads, garden salads... Everything looked better than those damn french fries so I almost knew my impulsive french fry order would haunt me.  Either way, for $9 after tax I was pleased and am going to still give the place this place 3 stars and some repeat lunch business for its other sandwich menu choices, but skipping the fries. Maybe I'll give it 4 stars when I try one of the salads."}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit and do work if you want a switch of from your local Starbucks. This place has free wireless internet, and a bunch of computers lined up against a wall. It's also huge and has high ceilings and tons of seating.   Now the food. It's a great place for a quick lunch. They make tons of made to order sandwiches (the BLT is my fav!) and they have tons of soups. By far my favourite thing to get here is their Mediterranean salad - made with pasta, peppers, tomatoes and kalamata olives and this delicious peppery mayo sauce.  All their other salads, like the tuna salad, vegetable pasta salad and Greek salad are equally as tasty and made fresh every day.    And of course, the croissants (they come in a million flavours from plain to chocolate to broccoli and cheese) are a must have.   I love this place when I need a quick bite and a quiet place to do some work - and I'm sick of ordering double soy latte moccachinos."}
{"text":"Decent menus, quick service and reasonable prices. Had the eggs bene, decent size. The salad was nothing to brag about. Overall would recommend if you're looking for a place with a low key atmosphere and decent food for a good price."}
{"text":"I miss The Croissant Tree. I used to go here for lunch regularly when I worked on Bloor Street and almost always got the same thing: the chicken avocado melt with side salad. There are lots of options for side salad, so that was where I would \"spice it up\" - maybe I was boring with the same sandwich, but I'd always try a different salad - fruit, pasta, greek, ceasar, and they are all freshly made and good. The tuna melt was pretty good too, but nothing could top the chicken avocado. When I - briefly - worked in the Eaton Centre, I visited the \"other\" Croissant Tree on Bay and they didn't have the chicken avocado melt. It's exclusive to Church Street, so when you go there, enjoy it! This place has a great outdoor patio that is never full, so definitely sit there when the weather is good. When I am next in the area, I'll probably drop in for old time's sake and to get my sandwich."}
{"text":"It's a very big coffee shop with lots of options for brunch. Portions are big and taste OK but maybe not perfect. It's good if you want to seat in a good neighborhood and have no one bother you to get out soon"}
{"text":"Very good coffee and croissants. Breakfast was good but the potatoes were quite bland. Atmosphere is very nice. There is lots of space to sit including couches."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio to sit and enjoy breakfast. The surrounding trees make this patio very nice and breezy. The fresh smoothies are delicious and their omelettes are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I worked in the same building as Croissant Tree, so during the summer I ate here  A LOT.   And...it was okay. I mean, they never switched up the menu and so it all became stale. So I should do my best to look at it objectively:  Pro - they've got wi-fi Con - they really don't like you staying if you're not eating or drinking something from there Pro- lots of tables Con - It's pretty expensive....actually really expensive for just sandwiches. Pro - their Mediterranean salad is decent. Con - the fruit salad is FULL OF MELON. Pro - It's licensed!  Con - It's licensed. Pro - (end on a high note) They have a REALLY nice patio.   That's pretty split - we'll say 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food was good when it came. Had to remind the waitress that we were still waiting. When it came out, it was cold. Others who came after us were midway through their meals. The food itself was good but would have been nice to have it warm."}
{"text":"Not bad. Decor dates from the dotcom boom days but it still looks pretty good. It's not a super busy place so you can eat in peace, although the food was middling.   Lola's Commissary is just across the street if you want fancier food and a more energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my second day in a row here. My first time here it was a good meal with certain aspects being incredibly delicious and other parts that just weren't. The eggs Benedict were perfectly poached but the English muffin underneath was soggy and didn't feel toasted (just my preference but I'm not crazy about non toasted English muffins). Today, I decided on a croissant, fresh fruit, coffee (totally basic) Croissant was a home run, the fresh fruit was good but not great. It was fresh but too ripe and not the crispness one expects. All in all, I was satisfied. I'll more than likely come back, but as jay Z says, on to the next one"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio on a sunny spring day. Their breakfast specials are great, and oh soo hearty- your choice of toady, fries and drink with your pick. They also have free wifi and comfy overstuffed couches inside."}
{"text":"Enough seats and food menu. I ordered waffle( with whipping cream, chocolate and ice cream) and coffee. It was good. I like to read a book with coffee here. Very quiet."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good eggs benny! I didn't expect much coming in, but my meal was absolutely delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked, bacon just the right amount of salty, and sides fresh. I didn't have a chance to try the croissants but I definitely will next time."}
{"text":"Probably more of a 3.5 star, but yelp doesn't allow that.  I came here three times to get coffee/breakfast during my 4 days in Toronto. We kept coming back because it was extremely close to our hotel, not expensive, relatively fast, and they had wifi (our hotel only had it in the lobby!).  We tried a variety of croissants and danishes each day, and the coffee and espresso drinks. My lattes were okay- not great, but very drinkable. The coffee was less good, and refills are not free, even if you are sitting in the restaurant. The croissants were good- a bit on the greasy side, but there were a lot of different varieties, and anything made with the amount of butter that goes into a croissant is going to be a bit greasy.  We particularly liked the bacon and cheese variety (why haven't they done this in the US?) The apple danish was also a highlight.  We didn't have enough time to order a full, hot breakfast, but everyone around us who did looked satisfied."}
{"text":"A very nice place! First of, very spacious - you can always find a seat. They have a great assortment of foods to choose from, from regular sandwiches, to croissants, and quinoa salads and all sorts of things. I really enjoy their food selection.  The coffee selection is rather limited, usually to three choices (at least the times I've been there). However, they have some interesting blends and flavours, which I have thoroughly enjoyed, so no complaints there, really.  I love studying there, since it tends to be rather quiet, but always has good seats. Love sitting on the couches next to the fake fireplace.  My only complaint is their relatively short hours...well, they are not even that short. They work until 7 (and 6 on the weekends) but they do tend to try to get people out before so they can close by that time. Nonetheless, this is one of my fave spots to do work downtown, so unless something equally diverse food-wise and spacious comes up soon, I'll be spending my moneys here! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Here is my biggest problem that I have with this place. It's name the Croissant Tree, but they don't have good croissants!  I mean, I've had worse. But I was expecting a memorable experience while eating there. But realistically it wasn't a memorable one.  I also had their grilled cheese which was greasy as hell. This was a terrible lunch and I expected more. Maybe I expected too much, but I was disappointed none the less.  I wouldn't recommend this place. but it isn't the worst place you could go to either."}
{"text":"I go here when I want a big mug of coffee and a quiet place to work. I've ordered the breakfast before and it was decent. The location is great and the patio is nice. Good for a less chaotic experience."}
{"text":"Patio is nice.  You can see potential in the place.  Lots of coffee options too.  I wasn't blown away though.  I keep meaning to go back but keep ending up at other places instead.    Looks like a good crowd on weekends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food there. Been there for breakfast and lunch several times during my Toronto trip. It was just across the street by my hotel. They had free WiFi."}
{"text":"Open rafters, free wifi, all day breakfast.....If I were a student looking for a place to hunker down to do some studying, this would be my favorite place, hands down.  Alas, those days are long gone. Now I'm skeptical about their mediocre coffee, the average eggs that I can make myself, and wifi? Nah, I gots that data plan!   I'll come here again, all points aside, mainly if I'm simply looking for a spot to grab a simple bite."}
{"text":"I went there in the morning and I like the quietness in the restaurants. I saw people reading and working there after finishing their meal. I had a croissant and it's decent. They have a big menu with lots of choices of food. The coffee was amazing, and they also offer different kinds of tea. Overall it was good experience and I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich egg and cheese on a large croissant plus fries and coffee less than $9. Epic potatoes!"}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict ever! Super friendly staff with great service and a nice patio up front."}
{"text":"I like their croissants! I don't like the sweet ones, but the one with bacon and cheese and the spinach-feta version are among my top breakfast choices. I live just 100 meters away, so I always get them fresh right out of the oven ... The coffee is bad, that's true."}
{"text":"First time staying in the area and my husband and I went there for breakfast because of the location to our hotel.  We were not disappointed!  Amazing breakfast, fantastic healthy menu options and I loved how you get a side garden salad with your eggs Benny instead of the typical fruit. Absolutely delicious and already wanting to go again"}
