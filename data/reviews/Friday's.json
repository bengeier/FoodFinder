{"text":"Restaurant (not bar) review:  POSITIVEs +free wifi (I'm struggling if this is the first pro I can think of) +they honored a coupon (second star for this really) +it was warm inside...??? (really struggling) +If you've been to a Friday's before, you (should) know what to expect with the food (usually good, but not here read below)  NEGATIVEs -Server completely inattentive at a VERY non-peak time (maybe 3 other tables used in whole restaurant) -- no drink refills even in plain sight, took 10 minutes to come back after food was delivered (to request changes to food)  -Food was ill-prepared.  Sandwich was not prepared as requested, steak was not cooked as asked, and condiments were not put on the side as requested either (the receipt shows the server had it right, but the cook maybe not?). Additionally, both of us felt sick that evening after eating there earlier, echoing what another reviewer said (Julia P).  -Food portions were lop-sided: Half of my entree was missing, when questioned about this, the response \"Are you sure?\" --- Look at the plate, it was never there and the two visible bites should help illuminate what/how much I ate (never mind the fact the \"customer is always right\" or supposed to be anyway)  -Irritable, irritated, and negative staff  The discussing tips, customers, and employee issues loud enough to be heard in the main seating areas from the back. Very unprofessional.  Overall: I can't see going there again, not for the food (bad), not for the atmosphere (negative), nor for the value. Save yourself from a bad experience and try anywhere else. The bar and its tenders might be a lot more fun, as Drew B points out, but then that was 6+ months ago, so who knows if they're still good..."}
{"text":"I went to the TGi's on the east side and it was fantastic. Even though I came out $50 less rich, I will definitely go back.  I paid for my date's dinner and he got a delicious steak & shrimp with a fully loaded potato (bacon & cheese & chives)! I ordered the jack daniel's chicken breast (2 breasts!) it was SO juicy and delicious.  I highly recommend it. The brownie dessert is to die for. Also, the french onion soup is SOOO good.  The layer of baked cheese on top is amazing. The food came out so fast, I could barely finish my soup. Go go go!"}
{"text":"I used to go here with my family, but we haven't been back since we realized how vegetarian unfriendly they are.  This is the one and only time that I've felt stigmatized for being vegetarian while in the Madison area.  Their rudeness was absolutely astounding.    After carefully studying the menu, I could not find a single item that was vegetarian.  When our waitress took our orders, I asked for some suggestions.  Her thoughtful and helpful response was \"I don't know.  Maybe you could have some peas??\" in a snotty tone of voice.  I was like \"Um.  You're kidding.  Right?\"  She wasn't.  She was so ignorant about vegetarianism that she actually had to go ask her manager what they have that is vegetarian.  I only give this review two stars because the manager's suggestion-risotto without the chicken-actually turned out to be really good.  I am not trying to sound high and mighty here, but vegetarianism is not that hard to figure out, and is something you should probably know at least a little about while working as a waitress in a progressive area.  I felt like I was made out to be a freak just for asking to order food that I can actually have.        My dad e-mailed the place to complain about how bad I felt during our dining experience and how disappointed he was in their service.  Their response? \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" with no further comments."}
{"text":"I did not like their food both times I went..I had burgers both times and they were gross and soggy. Ick. Plus, the waiter took forever to bring our food and our check. I seriously spent 2 hours eating when I could have spent half that time had I had a decent server! He constantly forgot things that we asked for too and I was left without something to drink a few times. Bad service."}
{"text":"Great staff. The Best Happy Hour in town. Friendly bartenders!"}
{"text":"Great place! Ever since they moved from West Towne Mall to Greenway, I have been very impressed. Awesome drink specials during football games and happy hours, great wings and other apps, and an awesome place to watch a game. This is my place of choice for the time being!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, spent plenty of money and always had a great relationship with the bartenders and management until they left. Then a new manager came in, she is unfriendly, doesn't speak to customers, stomps around up employees butts and not acknowledging customer like the old management did. The old management really engaged in the customers walked around the restaurant and greeted people. The last night I went we came in and she said something under her breath that was rude, however I still caught it. I ordered food to go and instead of handing it to the bartender, she slams it behind the bar instead of giving me my food. I hate the new management. Place is really going downhill."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price.  Service is terrific and always clean.  It is nice to see the Manager out in the resturant at all hours keeping things running well.  Ignore the other reviewer, Tracy from LA.  She says everything was great but only gives it three stars."}
{"text":"Bartenders are excellent. They flip bottles, perform magic tricks are attentive and make the out of town visitors feel at home. Crazy Mike is crazy and awesome. Food was good, not awesome, but good in general, and the prices are on par."}
{"text":"Between the filthy bathrooms that reek of urine, the food on the floor in the bar, the chipped and dented paint on chairs and booths, or the radically reduced menus, it is a wonder that TGI Fridays manages to stay in business.  Granted, we were there in the day, and we were sober, so we noticed when my mother put her forearm down on a chunk of food left on our table. Maybe alcohol would have eased our pain. We probably would have still noticed the flies zipping overhead, however."}
{"text":"This Fridays does have good service minus a few rotten eggs. Last time we went we ordered two entrees that consisted of Chicken Breast & Shrimp. So we order our food and drinks. The Mojito comes out about 10 minutes later. My coke came out quickly. The waitress would check up on us, if we requested anything she would acknowledge it and come back out with our stuff but stop at another table. Bring the stuff to the table then check on the other table. The manager was nice and did check up on. I wish TGI had food that wasn't so salty or sugary. The location is nice as we can walk from home. Service definitely beats the east side TGI."}
{"text":"The only thing I totally dig here is the french fried green beans, and hello--if you screw up frying something, then you REALLY have problems. So.   I got some sort of chicken salad once, and it was disgusting. The lettuce was soggy(gag) and just not good.  The last time I went, I got the cedar planked salmon, and it was decent.  An okay place to go if you have few options.  I was going to give this place one star, based on my experiences with TGI Fridays in general, but this actual location is all right...if you don't have many options."}
{"text":"I am stuck in the hotel without a rental car (ok that is my fault, but in my defense its ugly (lots of snow and black ice) out there and I don't want to have to worry about the conditions of the road).  So as I am checking in, one of the first things I asked was what places would deliver to the hotel.  My options were pizza, Chinese and Fridays.  Well, I had Chinese last night, and pizza just didn't float my boat tonight.  So I ordered the ribs (why not eat something messy when no one can see me?).  There were a lot of them and they were good.   Good service, I had told them I might be downstairs having a glass wine (which turned out to be the case).   He came over with a big smile on his face - such a friendly face a welcome change to my normal experiences."}
{"text":"Service: Excellent.  Waitress readily available. Manager checked up on us. Drinks: Good value.  Can't beat $3 margaritas and mojitos. Food: Half priced appetizers from 4-7 PM and after 9 PM. Atmosphere: Good.  Nice mix of people at the bar.  I would have given this Fridays more stars if I hadn't woken up in the middle on the night with tummy problems.  I guess the half price appetizers didn't agree with me."}
{"text":"There was large menu with many choices, but my boyfriend and I both got ribeye steaks. The flavor was really good and they were both cooked the correct way, but it seemed like the cut wasn't the best. Our waitress was really nice, but only refilled my boyfriends drink once, mine not at all. The food was pretty good though, and the brownie dessert we shared was amazing. I would go again, think the waitress was newer and don't want to let that ruin the experience."}
{"text":"This can be a great affordable family restaurant if you use the Stripes card they offer. They have a large menu and good service. They usually seat you right away."}
{"text":"It's Fridays. I'll go here if it's convenient but never by choice.  If you've never been, they have a variety of Americanized food. There are a few decent dishes like the pecan crusted chicken salad or anything with Jack Daniels glaze. As you can guess, the good dishes are either loaded with sugar or sodium and lack developed flavors.   They have some decent lunch specials starting around $7.  The service at this location is great and I go here if the group wants to for lunch. In my opinion there are just way too many other great options in Madison."}
{"text":"The host was amazing--nick I believe.  If you're going for a cheap meal and good appetizers this is the place. Their 2 for $10 or 2 for $15 (appetizer and entree) is awesome. Their drinks are really weak though!"}
{"text":"Was on business trip in wisconsin, walked over there from hotel. I was told to go to the bar. waited at the bar and wasnt even acknowledged. Mind you it was thursday @ 6pm so it wasnt that busy. After about 10-15 minutes i decided to walk out. Pretty rude and will not be going there again"}
