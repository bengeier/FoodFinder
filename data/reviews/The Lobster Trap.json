{"text":"\"Take your Groupon and shove it up your F*****g A**\" was the response I got after being hung up on, twice.

Even though I did read the so-so reviews about The Lobster Trap (Woodbridge location) online, I did decide to give it a try with a Groupon offer. Unexpectedly, I had to change my reservation and when I called the morning of (a Thursday) to re-schedule, I was told I could not without losing the value of the Groupon. I tried to reason with the woman as I was not cancelling my reservation, but re-scheduling it. I was promptly told that there was nothing else that could be done and she hung up the phone. I called back again and spoke with the same woman who was again abrupt and rude, telling me there was nothing that could be done, before hanging up on me a second time.

Not wanting to leave this on a sour note I tried one more time to call back and reason with the woman. This time a gentleman answered the phone. After telling him that I had been hung up on twice, he told me that no I had not, it was a cell phone that got disconnected... twice... hmm... really? He then gave me the introductory line of this review and hung up the phone.

Thank you Lobster Trap for ensuring I never come to your restaurant, along with anyone else I know or can reach by social media.

Groupon, I would like my money back."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we came to this place. After an hour of driving we found this place on the way and SO glad that we did. We were itching for some seafood and oysters and my my this place was exactly what our taste buds were wanting. The staff continued to check on us and make sure we were okay. Our server, Grace, was amazing- she was genuinely thoughtful. Food was a bit pricier but the food was just soooo good. So worth it. Side note- make sure to get the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have to say the best spot for lobster north of the 401.. great atmosphere awesome food and no rush environment.   Don't come here looking for fast food and in and out  experience.   Sit down relax with a bottle of wine and enjoy the lobster.   Truly worth it."}
{"text":"We went here for a friend's birthday and had an incredible experience. Service was a bit slow but it was worth the wait. We ordered the oysters for our appetizer and the seafood platter for our main. Everything was super fresh and really delicious. Our waiter was excellent and truly delivered a memorable experience including a round of shots at the end of our meal, as a thank-you for being patient. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Avenue Rd. locations numerous times over the years. It has been my favorite restaurant ever since I was introduced to it by a friend. When I found out that they had changed owners and moved to Vaughan, I thought i would give it a try since all the staff and cooks had moved to the new location.

I had an old dealfind coupon that was remaining but I was told that I could only use half of the value per visit.  The new owner would not honor my dealfind coupon as purchased. He stated that the old owner went bankrupt because of these coupons and hence he could not afford to provide the face value of the coupon in one visit.

I had also purchased 3 groupons for $40 for $80 worth of food.  The fine prints said one groupon per table. When I called, i was told that if i could arrive by 530pm that they would make an exception and seat our party of six together but that i shouldn't mention it to anyone.  Due to traffic, we arrived at 6pm to an empty restaurant and in spite that we had called to advise we were running late, the waitress advised that they could not accept the 3 groupons for our party of six.  I told her that I had spoken to the owner who had authorized it so she went to speak to him and he said no. After much discussion, I asked to speak to the owner directly. He came out and he explained that because we were 30 minutes late, we had to sit at separate tables if we wanted him to honor the groupons.  This being 2 days before my wedding day and 7 years since i had seen my parents and brother, the 6 of us had to split up into 3 tables of 2.  Meanwhile, other patrons that walked in the door in two's were seated at tables for 4 that were much more comfortable and the restaurant was still very much empty. 

At the previous locations, they had more tables and there was always a line up no matter what time you showed up. At this place, there was hardly any patrons.

The food was still good and still the same. We ordered our usual 1 and 1/4 pound lobster steamed which came with garlic bread and a side (baked potatoe, fries, rice, or salad).  The bill is usually $80 for two people if we order nothing but a lobster each.

What disappointed me was the service and the experience that I had.  The owner said he couldn't have a party of six occupy his larger tables in case they had patrons that came in groups of 4. There were a dozen tables for 4 however when i looked around they were occupied by parties of 2.  I never thought that by purchasing a groupon and going out of our way to get an earlier seating time of 6pm that the owner would be so inflexible.  My parents and brother were obviously disappointed that we could talk and catchup after all these years. 

The waitresses were very friendly and nice. The service was very good otherwise. It was just how the owner treated us that left a bad taste in our mouths.  I still have the old dealfind coupon for which i had paid $40 for.  I was also a regular customer at the old location which i frequented often without the purchase of a groupon. After being treated in such a horrible way that evening, I doubt that I will be going back there. It's too bad because the food was still the same but the restaurant is no longer the same restaurant from avenue road that I use to love."}
{"text":"Went for dinner in May 2013. The general atmosphere was confused and disorganized even but the service, overall, was excellent. Owners/managers and staff are very pleasant and clearly want to keep the customers happy. I had the seafood pasta which was good but the shells on the claws was annoying, no fun digging out claw meat from rose sauced shells. Lobster tail was good, though a bit overdone probably from getting the crust golden. Bisque was delicious, oysters superb. Not sure about wine list, wasn't offered and I didn't ask. Beer options limited to usual suspects, would love to see some local craft brews. Nice place, well decorated. I'd lose the guitar and singer though, space is too small. Overall, I think once the owners get everything down to a science it will be a success. Will give it another try for sure."}
{"text":"Surprised that there weren't a lot of people on Friday evening.  We got 1 1/4 lb lobster - half steamed, half broiled, lobster bisque, and seafood pasta.  Enjoyed the food a lot.  

The restaurant looks bigger from the outside, but it's nice inside.  Server was nice, checked on us every so often to see if we needed anything.  Didn't feel rushed or anything."}
{"text":"The seafood is great, the steak and chicken too. But it is the Lobster Trap - you really should have the seafood. The Coconut Shrimp is fantastic here, big shrimps, cooked perfectly, crispy coconut coating and a sweet tangy sause. 

The service is professional and polite, the decor is a dressed down fine dining atmosphere. So you can dress up if you want - or not. Price is reasonable, maybe $30 per person. Its a nice night out."}
{"text":"The food looks good, but it's overcooked and bland. They need a new chef with \"30 years of experience\". Terrible. Money wasted."}
{"text":"They give an unlimited amount of yummy garlic bread. I found that their seafood platter which consisted of raw oysters, lobster and mussels was not fresh at all. Their seafood pasta was tasteless, there was basically no sauce at all. The only thing I really enjoyed about this place is that their kids meal was $5 for a large plate of fish and chips. The portion was big enough for an adult and it was very tasty. I would only go back for the kids meal and garlic bread."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here just the other day.  It started off a little rocky when I had purchased a voucher online for the location in Toronto.  When I had called the number on the voucher a few weeks in advance I was told to go to the Woodbridge location.  So I did, but but when I arrived the server told me she couldn't accept the full value of it because it was for the other location.  Although it was frustrating for me coming all the way I completely understood that she was doing her job.  I left and called the number on the voucher again and the owner Valentino picked up.  He was super friendly and told me not to worry he would accept the voucher.  

I went back inside and the rest of the experience was rather wonderful!  I was brought some delicious tasting garlic bread to start.  When Valentino came in he sat down at my table to explain to me what happened with the voucher which was extremely nice of him.  He truly is a great and experienced owner who understands good public relations. When I ordered my meal I asked my server for advice on an appetizer and she suggested the Lobster Bisque which I have to say was delicious!  I ordered a broiled lobster for my meal.  I worked in a seafood restaurant during my teenage years and ate a lot of lobster.  I can honestly say this is the best one I've ever eaten.  There was a large amount of tomalley in it which I'm not such a fan of, but besides that the lobster was juicy and cooked perfectly!  Since I was going all out and treating myself the day before I was starting a diet I decided to order the chocolate cake.  It was okay.  Nothing special and a bit on the dry side, but with a squirt of caramel and chocolate sauce, and stuck in the oven for a minute to warm up and a scoop of ice cream it would have been perfect because the taste of it was good and it was huge!!   

The atmosphere itself is really nice.  It's clean and modern but also has a cozy feel.  The service was excellent. 

I'm really glad I went to this restaurant and even after the initial problem, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious lobster or seafood dinner.  And I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The best lobster in Toronto! Love all the food and the staff and service are amazing! Try the bisque!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I fully expected to be disappointed.  However, when I'm wrong I admit it.

I don't buy Groupons for restaurants anymore because it's always a bad experience.  However, when I saw the Groupon for this place my brain just focused on \"LOBSTER\" and all reason and logic went out the window and I bought it.

As per the Groupon instructions I called and tried to make a reservation.  I was speaking with a lady who was very grumpy and rude and instantly made me remember why buying restaurant Groupons is a bad idea.

Reluctantly, we had our reservation and made our way up to Vaughan from Milton.  We got there a bit before they opened but the Open sign was already lit up so we got out of the car and tried the door, it was locked.  At that exact moment an employee was getting out of his car and told us that we could wait inside at a table if we wanted.  He was friendly and polite and a stark contrast to what I had experienced when I called.

Turned out this employee was our Server and his name was Jay.  He explained the menu to us and was fast and attentive.

The other server working was also very friendly and polite.

We ordered coconut shrimp and lobster bisque to start and they were both delicious but the bisque stole the show.  I've tried a lot of lobster bisque and I am not usually impressed but this bisque is amazing!  Nice big chunks of lobster meat in it.  Great flavour.  

My wife and I each ordered broiled lobster and it was great.  It was cooked perfectly.  

My children each ordered the fish and chips and really enjoyed it as well.  I stole a few of their fries and they were delicious.  The tartar sauce is excellent as well.

I really can't say enough good things about our meal.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Only went because I had a groupon...really should have read the reviews before purchasing the groupon. Honestly I was quite disappointed with the overall experience since the food wasn't phenomenal. I ordered the 1 1/4 pound steamed lobster and my boyfriend ordered a medium rare strip sirloin. The wait for the food was longer than average (about 40 minutes), and they also forgot what I ordered around the 30 minute mark. Food was ok - lobster was kind of cold, steak was cooked right but kind of dry. When we finished up and the bill arrived, I was quite shocked. Expecting the bill to be around $83 ($40 for the lobster, $34 steak) and subtracting the $50 coupon, my bill was miscalculated and came up to $160 (not really even sure how this was possible). The server was very understanding, but they definitely need a better POS system in place, especially to ensure the orders are accurate."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy much at all but than I was the idiot who went to a lobster spot and didn't want to eat lobster 

My party enjoyed and would return and the lobster roll looked good

I would return for a lobster roll or to bring someone who wanted to try it"}
{"text":"We have been long standing and loyal customers of the lobster trap on avenue road for over 4 decades.  This new franchise / location attempts to pride it's self, on its affiliation of the original location, however they would not honour coupons that were issued to us from the avenue road location, so that we may try the new location.  So much for tradition and gratitude of long standing customers of the lobster trap name."}
{"text":"Stop in for a business lunch, great food. Really nice decor, newer that the other location on Avenue road. Love Lobster! Definitely return."}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant through a Groupon.  I ordered a 1.25 pound lobster dinner, while my girlfriend ordered the fillet mignon.  My lobster was pretty good, and was served with garlic butter, lemon and rice.  The baked potato that came with my girlfriends meal was not cooked enough, and the vegetables were not of high quality.

For the price of everything though, the food should have been of much higher quality in my opinion."}
{"text":"I had been a customer of the Lobster Trap's Avenue Road location for over 40 years and spent many a birthday dinner there with my family.  Unfortunately the service, atmosphere & food had really gone downhill recently so we had been searching for an alternative.
I was thrilled to find that the original chef (Sathiya) had moved to the  The Lobster Trap's Vaughan location so we decided to take a chance & try it.  Boy, I am glad we did!
From the moment we walked in, we were well looked after.  Our waiter (Mehmet) was extremely attentive and made sure my birthday dinner was perfect from start to finish.  
Our Dinner started with the Trap's yummy garlic bread.  Next, the Caesar salad  with homemade dressing was to-die-for.  Seriously, Sathiya  should bottle the stuff, it's that good & far better than the salads ever were at the Avenue location.  The lobster bisque was exactly as I remembered it, creamy & full of that sweet lobster meat.  For my main dish I ordered the classic live 1 1/2 lb. broiled lobster.  I was not disappointed...the lobster was cooked to PERFECTION.  If you had been a customer at the Avenue location you knew that lobster was really the only reason to dine there but my husband, who is not a lobster fan, decided to order the 10 oz. filet mignon.  Surprisingly, his steak was also perfectly cooked (medium rare) and cut like butter.  
To end off the meal & since we were there to celebrate my birthday, Mehmet surprised us with a piece of Bailey's cheesecake topped with a sparkler...or should I say fireworks.  The cake was delicious & the piece big enough for all of us to share.  What a perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Thank you Sathiya for the delicious food & Mehmet for making us feel so special.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went in with $35 for $70 worth of food with a groupon. Ordered 2 1lb lobsters - 1 broiled, 1 steamed. 2 lobster bisques added on, sides were chef salad and baked potato. Bill (post-tax and pre-tip) came to $90. Tipped $15, but I feel like I should have tipped much less, considering the poor service I received.

Arrived 7 minutes late, waitress gave away table already. Would have been fine if they called to tell us this, but nope. They just did it without any notice. This was a little frustrating, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. However, I feel that this is pretty poor business practice. If you're going to ask for my phone number, why would you not use it?

Another waitress seated us, just to kick us out as she meant to seat another couple. This is just completely disorganized, as well as a bit frustrating. However, we ended up having a 4 person table for the two of us, so it ended up alright.

Ordered one broiled, one steamed. Waitress brought 2 broiled, then realized it was for the table behind us. Once again, disorganized. 

The whole meal, the waitresses paid much more attention to the tables around us than to us. This was just the overall feeling I had at this restaurant.

When it came to paying, they just gave me the POS terminal and had me enter in all the information. This is just poor business practice, just because I could have entered in nothing at all and gone with it. If I didn't know how to operate the terminals, it would be even more annoying.

Without the Groupon? I would have been very frustrated with the dining experience. Would have been paying quite a lot on good food but terrible service."}
{"text":"I frequented the original/former location many, many times as I was growing up and as an adult. I took my boyfriend for his birthday to show him what a lobster experience is and this place was as good as ever! Maybe even better since the service was impeccable. Shout out to our server named Reza who was awesome. Don't hesitate to eat at this place because it's amazing.  

Also to all the bad reviews....y'all are whack this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Hello everyone this will be totally unbiased from a person who works VERY hard for their money.  I got a groupon and thought WOW lets have a special evening at the new Lobster Trap.  I used to love going to the one on Avenue Rd as a child with my big brother.  What a treat!...WELL, my husband and I thought lets rekindle a memory and and enjoy some lobster.  FORGET IT!....the lobster was chewy and the bill for two would have been 200! if it werent for my GROUPON for which i got 70 dollars off.  I left the waitress 20 dollars even though I really didnt think it was worth the service at all.  By the way, the waitress brought me boxes to pack up the leftovers by myself....Buy your own lobster and cook this at home.  DID i mention that the garlic rolls were SOAKED in oil..not butter...YOU will be full by the time the entree arrives because of all the OIL you ate in the rolls....GROSS...
Give you money to charity....dont get fooled by the special deal...there is no deal to be had here.....the lobster wasnt sweet at all...
My husband didnt want to start a fight so he just said thank you baby for dinner...but he really was grossed out and I could tell.  One day this WILL spring up in a fight about how much money I wasted on trash food.  HONESTLY...they took money for nothing...MONEY for NOTHING....gone are the days of yummy lobster...unless I cook it myself.
btw: lobster is 5.99 a pound at Metro!!!
good luck y'all and remember I TOLD YOU SO!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! Will never go back there and will stay with my 20 year favorite Lobster Royale. The owner-manager is a coward who knows zero about customer service. I tried to use two buytopia vouchers for my table of 4 but then was told I couldn't even though voucher clearly states that I can. I asked to speak to manager 3 times but he hid in the kitchens and sent his waitress out each time. Apparently my kids did not count as people dining in his cheap restaurant and he would not honor the vouchers. I ordered enough food for 4 people. But I left promptly after he would not talk to me and I will never go back again. Save your money for Lobster Royale and their bisque is way better too. I blame Buytopia equally for supporting this fraudulent behavior."}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood place in town. I had stream lobster, king crab legs, mussles, and Shrimps. For apperitezer I had the lobster bisque (the best I've had) and half a dozen oysters. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and provided great suggestions. Next time I go I want to try a pasta dish and I  will definitely be having the lobster bisque soup!"}
{"text":"The absolute best simply said.. try it for yourself. My wife and I have been coming here for years.. consistently amazing.  Fantastic service only out done by amazing seafood"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon, haha my fave way to start a sentence!  

Anyways the lobster was the best part of this menu.  It was amazing! We order the combination can't remember what it's called.  But everything else was ok.  The pasta was pretty good but the mussels skip it!  Trust me!"}
{"text":"This is my first post, but I feel I need to let ppl know about this.  We went because I purchased the groupon.  When we get there, we were surprise by how overprice it is.  We ordered lobster bisque, 2 order crab cakes and a halibut steak.  The bisque is okay but it's a but too much wine, I actually like it but some people might not.  The crab cake is extremely small and pricy.  The taste was a bit salty and lastly the halibut steak is too small and vege is not fresh.  I wonder never go back again."}
{"text":"This place was a real surprise! After reading some not so great reviews, I was a little anxious coming to this place. It turned out to be an enjoyable experience. 

I came here with a few friends using a groupon deal that allowed us to get $75 worth of food for less(groupon value $37). We ordered the oysters to share, lobster bisque and a 1 lb of lobster broiled that came with the option of a side, so I of course, ordered fries. 

The oysters were decent and a good enough size to share. The sauce that in came with paired nicely. The lobster bisque was amazing! I loved it. The flavours and thickness of the bisque was perfect. The lobster was also delicious, I preferred it broiled but they also had it steamed. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this dining experience and our server was very nice too! I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for some lobster."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here! Unlike the new seafood restaurants that are all about the sauce and messy eating, this is more of a sit down and stripped down meal (think of a simple steamed lobster + butter).

When we arrived for our booking at 7pm, the table was not prepared yet (we had a group of 14 and the tables that were for us still had guests eating there). Initially I was very unhappy about this, but the waitress apologized and even provided our party with two complimentary bottles of beer, and a round of shots for everyone towards the end of the meal. About 10 minutes or so later, we were seated and promptly served.

The lobster bisque was a big bowl of oh SOOO creaminess, had lots of lobster bits and lobster flavour; it was completely satisfying. I ordered a 1 lb broiled lobster -- it was delicious with the garlic butter (they add real garlic pieces into your melted butter for you!--so many yums), but I found the lobster to be a little overcooked and was tougher than I'd like. I also had a side of baked potato and they provided me with as much bacon, green onions, and sour cream as I wanted to add. 

Garlic bread was very good too, but compared to Lobster Royale (our previous go-to lobster restaurant that has unfortunately closed down now) it was not made with fresh garlic; just garlic butter spread on top.

Overall it was an enjoyable meal, service was very generous despite not having our table prepared on time. I personally prefer Lobster Royale more, but since it has closed down for a couple years now, Lobster Trap will be our new go-to lobster place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to lobster trap for 52 years. I started at the avenue road location and just celebrated my 52 year birthday at this location ! My parents brought me to the trap  when I was just a baby and fell in love with it since that time . The lobster I had on my birthday was exactly how I remembered it .. sweet, tender and delicious. Started with the garlic bread ,
Oysters lobster bisque and a 3.5 pound lobster ... excellent and has not changed... I will keep
Coming back... same table cloths menus etc ...

Actually my parents said they used to come to the lobster trap when it first opens in Scarborough ... even before the avenue road location ..."}
{"text":"Been a number of times.   Was great initially.   Then a new (supposed)  chef came in.   Decided to Lafleur buckets of hot water over the open lobster. 

Dreadful idea.   I spoke to the owner, he didn't give a darn actually... He he just justified this ridiculous practice the the I've never seen ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE. 

I haven't been in a while.   I hope they've stopped doing it!"}
{"text":"GREAT food and fantastic waiter who anticipated what we would need. We ordered quite a bit and personally when I go to a restaurant and order one soup between myself+the boyfriend ...99% of the time they give one spoon per order. He gave us two without asking and always came by to ask if we were ok and if we needed more water or sour cream etc. It was phenomenal - we left a good tip. He deserved it. Especially since he was tying everyone's bibs!! It was very cute. However, I docked one star and gave him especially a good tip because the manager was god awful. What an idiot. Forced me to show we had reservations WHEN NO ONE before or after us did. She forced me to show her our email confirmation and then continued on to make me show her the TIME of our reservation and the entire email chain. She was rude to the waiter when he told her he was setting our table already. So awful!!! Cheers to our waiter for dealing with such an awful person."}
