{"text":"This place gets 3 stars because it has been around forever.  I came for the well renowned Indonesia chicken rice and i was not disappointed.  This is the only dish we ordered (3 of them) and mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Most regulars at Restaurant Fifty Nine know this restaurant as 'Super Station'.
Most regulars here are somehow connected to one another socially. Most regulars here have never ordered anything other than number 58 off of the menu.

I have no idea where this restaurant got their inspiration for their menu. It has everything from escargots to French fries. It opens until 5am because most patrons visit during the midnight and early morning hours. I have witnessed the furniture and d√©cor go from old to rotting. The television at the counter predates to the birth of my now teenage sister. Nothing ever changes here, and that's precisely the reason why Restaurant Fifty Nine has remained open since the freaking 80's!

I don't know why they changed their name to Restaurant Fifty Nine, because number fifty eight is clearly their golden goose. The Indonesia chicken with rice or spicy rice is perhaps the most delicious dish any human being could hope for in Scarborough. The succulent pieces of pan fried brown meat complimented with two skewers of breast, with sunny-side-up egg hits the palate rich tones of I don't know what the fuck what. The recipe for this dish is impossible to decipher, and so I find myself making the drive and always ordering a double portion to make my trip worthwhile. There are other good items on the menu, but nothing comes close to 58. I always see someone I know when I visit, not something I am too thrilled about. After all, Scarborough isn't known for its sense of community.

You will get the truly authentic washroom experience here, as it smells so properly like a washroom. The pungent odour of piss smacks me in the face as I try to hold my breath and do my business. Even so, it isn't enough to deter my appetite. If I own the place, I wouldn't clean the thing either, knowing that I hold such heroin over my patrons.

I have never seen the chef's face. It has always been just one man in the back slaving away. I have tried to get a glimpse of the man so that if I were ever to see him in public, I would immediately make him an offer of he couldn't refuse in exchange for the bloody recipe. I guess somehow Jenny--the owner--knows this, and thus had never let him out of the kitchen when there are other human beings present. Jenny is a nice woman, I like her a lot. She has two daughters, just a random fact my fingers needed to type out.

Affectionately, I will always call this place Super Station. I have many great memories that I'd rather not remember from years ago eating here with my drunken after-hour friends. I recommend anyone to come here at least once and try the Indonesian Chicken with Spicy Rice, and to take a piss in their disgusting urinals."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant at around 10:30pm on a Wednesday night. It was very dark inside kind of dim-lit like a bowling alley and also smelled strongly of smoke, like someone was smoking inside. Also, the waitress was just sitting at a table and was watching the tv and didn't pay much attention to us. Not unusual for a Chinese restaurant though. Didn't have high expectations of this place from first impressions. They have a daily special that comes with soup and salad but when we tried to order it the waitress told us that there's no more soup and salad so we didn't get it since it wouldn't be worth the price. Got curry chicken rice and pan fried ho fun. Food is actually pretty good, something I didn't really expect from this place. Also, according to yelp it's open until 4am so it would be a good place to go for late night Chinese food as the price is pretty standard. Would probably come back if nothing else is open in this plaza. Didn't like the atmosphere but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place is hiding at a small corner in midland/finch plaza. It's kinda hard to find. But it's a must-try place. 

I was shocked by the bad review on YELP too. As recommendation, I ordered No.58 on the menu. I have to say ITS DAMN DELICIOUS!!!!! It combined with chicken, pork, fried egg and rice. The pork skewer is crispy outside and juicy, flavoured inside!! The chicken as well!! The egg was a perfect fried egg! It's not a well done egg like most places. And the rice underneath it's yummy as well. Tbh, I hardly eat rice but this rice I finished more than half( cuz the portion was too much I cannot finish them all). With this plate, they gonna offer you a bottle of sauce. It's one of the secret staff for this dish. You can just add sauce on your rice and meat as much as you want. Try to finish the whole bottle XD~
The most important thing, this dish is not like the normal Chinese restaurant, not so oil. It tasted delicious and healthy.

It's a pretty good experience. I would like to be there again."}
{"text":"A popular late night spot in Scarborough located the corner of Midland and Finch, this place is opened till 4am in the morning. The place is a little bit dingy and rundown but. This establishment does allow smoking inside so you will lots of smokers dining at the restaurant. A friend recommended coming here so I decided to give this place a try. Their dishes are surprisingly good for a late night meal/snack I ordered No 58 on the menu which was the Indonesia fried chicken with rice and egg is one of their most popular dishes on the menu. It doesn't come with a drink so you have to order it separately. 
I was surprised that the dish was very good. I totally was not expecting how delicious this dish was. The chicken was nicely cooked and seasoned. The fried rice had a little bit of kick in it but not too spicy.  My only critique about this place is the smell of cigarettes and smoke in the establishment but can't do much about that. Overall, not a bad place to grab a bite if you are looking for somewhere to eat late at night after clubbing or party. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Fifty Nine is a low key late night spot (open till 4AM!) located at the Finch and Midland plaza - not many people know about it I've found. They serve pretty basic food (rice, fried egg, your choice of protein), and honestly, if I was given the same ingredients I'd probably do a better job. Maybe if it was cheaper I'd visit more often. Truth be told, I'd only come here if I had the munchies and everything around me was closed."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here ever since I moved to Canada in 1997, and it still exists today despite the changing nature of the Finch-Midland plaza. You have to give credit to the fact this place is one of three (according to the owner) that's still standing since the 80s.

The 3-star rating is a combination of food and an absolutely friendly owner (note: only the owner is friendly. The other two employees - yes they only have three employees here - aren't as social and talkative). If I'm rating just the food, it'd be a 2-star. This place has absolutely zero specials or meals of any kind, and everything is a la carte. For example, a table of two with two bowls of noodles and two drinks would total around $23, as everything is counted separately. Considering the dark atmosphere of this place, one would surely go beyond this place for good food, and it shows for the fact I never see more than 3-4 tables full here.

Now, why did I say the owner makes the 2-star rating a 3-star? Aside from the owner being very talkative, he is willing to experiment with new techniques to make food, and will certainly take your advice on how to make the food better. My dad spent a good 20 minutes talking to him after our meal, and the owner actually explained the whole process of how he cooks the meals. Of course, my dad offered ways to modify some ingredients to make it tastier and/or healthier, and the owner was thankful of my dad's suggestions. Since he's willing to take advice (and let's be honest, I didn't get a stomach ache after my meal so at least it's edible), I give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went there because of appointment with my dentist. There are a lot of Chinese restaurants in that area. So I thought this little traditional HK style tea room could have some specialty to suffer such a long time.
However , I am wrong! When I have a seat, the HK owner talked me in Cantonese, when I speak Mandarin to him, he didn't change the language which made people feel impolite. I ordered a fried calamari and corn fillet rice. The calamari on unwashed lettuce is too little in amount, but the price is $5.95. The rice was very sticky like cooked a few days ago.There were only three fillets!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised at the bad reviews. You have to order item #59. A long time ago they decided to create the best item on the menu. Guess which item it was?? 59 lol. 

It's a little grimy inside and a hole in the wall but so worth it. The chef is talented and the server is a very nice lady. Must try!!"}
{"text":"- Open til late. 
- Allow smoking

Been here a couple times. One time I ordered a fish fillet on rice for a little under $10 and got 5 thin pieces of fish fillet and a full large chinese takeout box of rice."}
{"text":"I really had no expectation for this place. I just needed a quick bite so randomly stopped by. The place needs a major renovation. Very dated and mismatched furniture. But nevermind that, no big deal.
The food was fine and no big complaints. 

We ordered from the lunch menu. It came with a soup which used canned mushrooms and tasted very bland. It really didn't taste like anything except for cream.

I asked for an extra bowl and he brought it over promptly with a spoon. And the spoon was so dirty I almost hurled. I don't mean there was just leftover food on it or that it was stained, it looked like it was used as an ashtray or left in the kitchen corner untouched for months. We just kind of froze when we saw it but it somehow didn't see it and just walked away.
Needless to say, it remained untouched for the rest of the meal. 

When we finished I asked for a box to pack my leftovers to go. He proceeded to take my plate to the back and I politely asked if he could just bring out the box. He asked \"what's the difference?\" and started to walk away. I said \"I prefer to pack it myself\" and had to take the plate from his hands.
He was not happy and didn't look at us or say thank you or bye when we left.
Really not sure why he took it so personally and got so offended.

Obviously not going back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so appalling you wouldn't believe it exists, especially if you're a serial Yelper with solid expectations of restaurants. Me and some friends were looking for a midnight bite but weren't feeling for Perfect or Kenny's. We went to this restaurant on a whim despite ratings because reviews spoke of some redeeming quality about the food. The restaurant is truly 1/5 but as per what everyone else reviewed, it was so ENTERTAINING TO EAT THERE that I'd give them a 2/5:

- Felt like I was in being served dinner in someone's filthy living room. There are no smoking signs at each table yet they let people smoke inside, thus it literally reeked. Seats are ripped, walls stained, highlight was the broken fridge being used as a shelf. Chinese soap opera playing on TVs, tacky wall art of dolphins
- Paper menus were crinkly, re-used so an unknown amount of dirty hands touched them before yours - one of ours had a floor plan drawn onto the back by a past patron
- Ordered the 58 (pork kabob and chicken steak on spicy rice with Indonesian sauce). The portion was enough to feed 1 very hungry person or 2 little bit hungry people. Instead of pork kabob we were served a piece of pork chop. It was nice to come with a small sunny-side up egg. Food tasted 3/5 but it was definitely something easily whipped up at home.

The food wasn't good enough to call it a \"hidden gem\" but I would recommend this restaurant to anyone intentionally willing to lower their standards for the shock and laughs I got out of it. Won't be back but wasn't disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"It's just past 2AM and I'm laying in bed wondering where I can eat because I've got a late night craving going on...

My girlfriend suggests this place since it's down the street from her, and so we went...

I've been to this complex quite a few times when 360 Seahood used to be around, but never seemed to notice this hidden place, and I'm glad I did, because I didn't know they were open until 4AM! That's right... you late night owls who want some HK style late night food, this is THE spot. My girlfriend was actually afraid I'd complain about the quality of food and the scenery of this restaurant, but surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. (At this time of the night anyways...)

Don't expect a fancy place, it's a super casual late night spot, and it doesn't smell the best inside either, if you've been, you'll know why. But their food was really on par, and it tasted good! Their BBQ short rib with spicy fried rice actually comes with a fried egg (which isn't listed on the menu), and it comes with this soy sauce or bbq sauce that seems to be pretty addictive... I got my typical lemon iced tea, and I didn't expect much of it, but the tea base was actually strong enough, and it was a big cup too.

As you can tell, I'm content with discovering this late night spot, and I'll definitely be back. But remember to bring some cash with you, because they don't accept any other methods of payment!"}
{"text":"I do have respect for Restaurant Fifty Nine to have stayed in business for over 25 years but really it had way passed its prime and really in need of a makeover. #Totally80s Theme

Owner/Cook/Waiter is nice and friendly but the food I ordered was mostly a miss.

Pasta in Bolognese Sauce with soup and drink ($5.95) is good price. But sadly the Cream of Mushroom soup was not creamy, the HK style milk tea has no tea taste and watery. The pasta though was not not bad.

It is always a sad to see business going downhill, but most of the time things need to be done if they want to survive.

*So apparently the only thing I should be ordering according to reliable source is #58 Indonesia Chicken Rice and #58 only. I might have to go back again..."}
