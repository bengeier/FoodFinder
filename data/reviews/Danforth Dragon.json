{"text":"I can't stand by and have the dragon diss'd. The chili chicken is amazing and the chicken pakoras are out of this world. Totally unique. Don't go here expecting sweet and sour chicken balls and standard Chinese fare. Investigate the Hakka menu and don't wimp out. Nice folks too...gotta help them stay in business. I'd weep if they weren't around. Do it!"}
{"text":"Of the Chinese places in our area (that don't do dim sum) this is one of the best. Good prices, fast delivery, and a crispy ginger eggplant that's better than either of the meat offerings. There are some misses, but if you're willing to try the Hakka menu you won't be disappointed. The veggie pakoras in particular are a delight, especially when paired with the mutter paneer."}
{"text":"I ordered from Danforth Dragon on the advice of a friend. Amazing!!! We had the ginger beef, chilli chicken, shrimp pakoras and mixed veg. Everything was to die for!! Excellent value, fantastic food, fast delivery and friendly service!! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried here is delicious. Very fast and accommodating service. Many dishes come with rice included and they always give us some ice cream for free as dessert. The fish masala appetizer is great as is the crispy ginger eggplant. Reasonable prices. Kid utensils, cups, high chairs, and booster seats. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food. Greasy , stirfry, 100% asian! We go there for a lunch almost every day. Exceptional service - no complaints."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been ordering from them for a few years now. Great \"traditional\" Canadian Chinese food - with a great spin. Most items will be very familiar to anybody who enjoys Canadian Chinese, yet with a certain uniqueness that makes this place just different enough to stand out from the usual run-of-the-mill fare most places offer. It's not gourmet, nor is it meant to be. It's simply great tasting comfort food. Did I mention the HUGE portions?"}
{"text":"I love Danforth Dragon! It's the only place we order Hakka from. Order the spicy egg rolls and ginger beef, my fav."}
{"text":"I've been to the Dragon twice, and overall, it's good.  Pluses: Hakka cuisine, a blend of Chinese-Indian. The chili chicken was good, better the first time than the second time. Friendly staff, service is quick. It's right near Donlands subway, a very good thing during winter. The taste doesn't measure up to the other Hakka places I've eaten at (Federick's and Lin Garden), but it's not located in the middle of Scarborough so I can live with this.  Minuses: The cheesy decor and the tricky steps to the bathroom.   Bottom Line: It's cheap, has generous portions and is obviously a fan of alliteration!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service at affordable prices. The pakoras are to die for, the crispy ginger chicken is out of this word and the chili chicken will have you crying  with its spiciness while wondering why you just can't stop eating it - because it's so damn good! Recommended for people who likes real Chinese food and embrace Indian food's heat, you won't be disappointed.  If you like your food bland or think Chinese food is about sweet & sour chicken balls, skip it."}
{"text":"I've never been dissappointed with my meal here.  Our favourites include the Shrimp Pakoras, Chili Chicken (spicy), Ginger Beef, Sauteed Green Beans and the Manchurian Fish.  Hot, spicy and fresh.  Remember that it's Hakka food (Chinese Indian), and not your typical Chinese food.  We always order a few dishes for the variety, then take the leftovers home."}
{"text":"It was possibly one of the best guy TV nights ever: Nadal and Djokovic battling it out for the US Open tennis finals, not one but TWO Monday Night Football games, and last but not least - the Bachelor Pad season finale.  OK, so maybe the latter doesn't make most guys' lists...with so much quality TV on, one cannot possibly labour over dinner so there was no better time to call DD for some Chinese delivery.  My neighbor recommended it a few weeks prior.    The food was delivered in 30-45 minutes as promised.  No delivery charge for orders of $30 before tax.  The DD website is helpful with fairly accurate pictures.  The Good: Chicken Pakoras (anything in ball format and deep fried must be good), Crispy Ginger Chicken OK: Manchurian Fried Rice (how do they get the rice that red?) Pass: Szechuan vegetables... I normally don't order veg at Chinese restaurants but needed something to offset the other items  Here's a useful tip - Chinese takeout goes really well with sparkling wine or white wine.  The acidity makes for a good offset to the grease.  We heard the Crispy Ginger Eggplant (from the same deep fried goodness family as the Crispy Ginger Chicken) was to die for, but thought it would be too heavy to order that on top of what we had.  Look forward to trying that and other dishes.  4 dishes came to $36, with plenty of leftovers for a 2nd meal."}
{"text":"This joint is off the beaten path of the hustle and bustle of the main Danforth strip.  We walk in and were immediately greeted and seated. They have one high chair and plates/bowls and children's plastic utensils.  We proceeded to order half an order of shrimp pakoras, Manchurian fried rice and deep fried ginger chicken.  The pakora were served with a cilantro based dipping sauce. They also have an In-house hot sauce which was very good. They were piping hot and fresh. Sooooo delicious!   This was followed by the Manchurian rice which tasted just like any other fried rice. I could not taste the cilantro or hot sauce. But it was very good.  The ginger chicken was tasty and was the dry kind without too much sauce the way I like it. It was on the sweet side which is not my personal preference but the dish was good when eaten with white rice.  The price was on the higher side. Total bill came to $34 and $40 with tax and tip. Service was excellent. They kept refilling our glasses and the food came promptly. We also had lots of leftovers that we took to go.  Very good overall. Would definitely return to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Friday night in with Friend - Awesome take-out:  Pakoras (Fish) - Full 13.99 - Succulent pieces of meat mixed w/ special hakka & Indian spices & delicately deep-fried. An amazingly delicious appetizer, served w/ lemon wedges to bring out an irresistibly tangent flavor.

Manchurian Beef - 12.99 - Cooked in Manchurian sauce made of green chilli, fresh coriander, onions, ginger & lots of garlic (chicken & ribs lightly breaded)  Special Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles or Lo Mein - 12.50 - Broccoli, Chinese greens, carrot, onions, baby corn, mushroom, snow peas, shrimp, chicken & pork on thin egg noodlesBroccoli, Chinese greens, carrot, onions, baby corn, mushroom, snow peas, shrimp, chicken & pork on thin egg noodles  Manchurian Fried Rice - Veggie - 8.50 - Fried rice in Manchurian flavour made of green chilli, fresh coriander, onions, ginger & lots of garlic  Ma Po Tofu - 9.99 - Soft Bean Curd w/ some diced vegetables in chilli Soya flavour"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and good portion sizes for what you pay.  They are super fast, too.  When I put in orders to pick up, they would be ready within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I have never ate in but have done takeout several times. The service is fast and friendly. I imagine eating in would still be a pleasurable experience.  I have tried several items on the menu and it ranged from OK to delicious I want to keep ordering this! I am a meat loving eater but I actually found the vegetarian dishes in general better then the meat dishes. But overall, I enjoy the food and will keep going back and trying other dishes.  I do have some favorite dishes such as the crispy ginger eggplant which is so yum. The deep fried vegetables balls are great too. I also like their hot sauce which you can buy in a jar for home."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for us. We order from here regularly and have yet to try something we haven't liked. We usually order items marked as \"Hakka\" and haven't gone wrong. Delivery is always super fast. My only complaint would be that they aren't open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Not too familiar with Hakka to make an informed review, but thoroughly enjoyed the Crispy Ginger Eggplant and look forward to my return."}
{"text":"Want to rate it a 3 but giving it a 4 because I was in the mood for something else so don't want to take it out on them :) The food was too salty/spiced, which is what Hakka is but...everything kind of tasted like the other dish except the crispy eggplant, that was sweet. Also, getting it delivered made the fried batter soggy. Probably better to eat at the restaurant then."}
{"text":"Great Haka! I'd recommend the Chili Chicken, Haka Chowmein, and either the chicken or shrimp pakoras...  Delivery is also available."}
{"text":"How this place gets any positive reviews is beyond me.  I ordered satay, curry and kung pao.  All 3 were nearly identical - greasy sauce (which pretty much all tasted the same), vegetables and gristle.  Honestly, probably the worst food I have ever ordered (and I order a lot).  Unless you think mall food court food is haute cuisine, don't bother."}
{"text":"Good Chinese Hakka take-out.  If you are bored with Canadian Chinese food, this is a great place to branch out and add some hakka heat to the mix.  They have an extensive menu with man Canadian Chinese traditional items.  I've tried and love the chicken pakoras, Hakka fried rice, Hakka vermicelli and Hakka veggies.  It's Chinese food with an Indian flavour.  I have no idea if this is one of the best Hakka places as its my first and only so there is no frame of reference.   Delivery is fast and friendly.  For $40-$50 you get enough food to feed 4-6 people."}
{"text":"Love the jeera chicken, pakoras and egg roll are meh.  Quality is inconsistent and pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Hahaha... don't listen to all those people who aren't satisfied with the Danforth Dragon. Those are the same people who think Chinese food is chicken balls, egg rolls and fortune cookies. Hello! Those are just made-up foods.  China is a massive country with so many regional cuisines. What most people in Toronto think of when they think of Chinese food is actually Cantonese food. The more well-known, but less famous Chinese foods are probably Szechuan and Shanghai (dumplings, green onion pancakes, etc.) fare. Hakka food, on the other hand, is a different beast altogether... and at the Danforth Dragon, they don't serve pure Hakka food... but they serve Indian-influenced Hakka food.  They serve food that is popular amongst the Hakka Chinese living in India. You're not going to find Cantonese Chow Mein here, folks.  Back to the restaurant: the service is always excellent, and the food is always amazing! I usually order the dishes that are either spicy or cripsy... those are my favourite. If you aren't sure, ask for guidance and the chef/owner will be happy to oblige!"}
{"text":"This isnt a bad place to check out if you are in the danforth area and dont feel like traveling far.  It was my first Hakka experience.  I went and got crispy pan friend noodles but they wernt and crispy as I liked.  The menu wasa pretty extensive combo of Indian and Chinese food."}
{"text":"Their delivery is super fast and always fresh. The shrimp pakoras are so delicious. Their Manchurian rice is a must try as well as crispy ginger beef and honey garlic chicken. Always enjoy the food during the winter months. The best Chinese/Indian/Hakka in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I was heading over to Square Boy for a gyro but stumbled onto this Chinese Hakka restaurant on the south side of the Danforth.  Place is small, clean with friendly service. Extensive selection of Cantonese/Szechuan dishes and some Hakka scattered in the menu.  Ordered the crispy eggplant (#117A) which was crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  The gingery sweet sauce was not overly oily or saucy but could have been more Hakka spicy for me.  Very filling meal and will be back to try more of their Hakka style cuisine like the shrimp pakora but not sure about the other stuff."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant (I live a block away) and I eat there every week! The food is always great, fast to order and the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend the crispy ginger chicken!"}
{"text":"I wandered here on my visits to Danforth. There were quite a few options for inexpensive eats in this stretch but the Hakka cuisine sign pulled me here. I haven't had Hakka style Chinese in a long long time. I went through the menu and decided on the Chicken Manchurian (what is a better dish to represent the Sub Continent take on this style of food) I waited for my food and looked around the seats were all empty and the phone rang nonstop, this leads me to believe this is more of a take out/delivery place. My food was brought in quite fast and sadly it didn't arrive on the sizzling platter that is the claim to fame for this dish. Never mind I tried the food without the rice first to get an idea of what I was in for. This dish disappointed as it neither had the sweetness nor the heat that is the signature for this item (I am guessing they are skimping here on Ketchup and chilli sauce which believe it or not are the key ingredients for the sauce for this dish) This is more of a place to fill up rather than enjoy, solely based on this signature dish for this cuisine. 2 Stars.   Some interesting observation is that while there is No MSG sign on the menu they cook food without it by request!"}
{"text":"Short Review: Order the Spicy Fried Noodles, somewhat a Hakka-fusion and it was surprisingly decent, in a way that I did not have a headache after eating it. The price was average about as average as other Chinese restaurants could get.   However, I did like the mango ice-cream served when you pay the bill, it's quite a nice complimentary treat."}
{"text":"Love love love the food here! Love the shrimp pakora's.Very friendly service. Food is freshly made and  reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"The best asian Hakka restaurant I have found so far in town.   If you are into spicy dishes the Manchurian and chili chicken are spot on. I also recommend the crispy ginger beef, sauteed green beans and the Yeung chow fried rice. The chicken pakoras are also and great appetizer too.  Good portion containers too when it comes delivered. Service is pretty fast coming from the Danforth to downtown."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend for their spicy wings. We ordered those, steamed dumplings, a Cantonese type chowmein and a Manchurian fried rice. Everything was flavorful, and fresh. Will definitely order from them again, if only for those awesome spicy wings."}
{"text":"For those who don't know what Hakka cuisine is, it's basically Chinese food with an Indian twist. Apparently created by Chinese who moved to India, this style of food has become a category of its own and grown to follow people around the world, and I'm grateful!   Danforth Dragon is a really great place for Hakka. The quality is good; not the best, but pretty darn good. More importantly, it's not too oily which can often be the case with Hakka cooking. The prices are bog standard for the city but that's a good thing as it's very reasonable.  You can't go wrong with Danforth Dragon if you're a fan of either Chinese or Indian food."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and tried this place because of the good reviews. I ordered General Tao chicken on fried rice, and 3 vegetable spring rolls on the side.   The food was a regular size portion, but the price is a bit higher than I'm used to. Typically I'd pay $10-$12 for my order, but at Danforth Dragon it costed $17 (no delivery charge, I picked it up)   Overall, the service was great, the food was really hot and fresh so 5 stars is deserved!  I'll definitely be back!   The only complaint I have is about the price, but you get what you pay for I suppose."}
{"text":"I blame me for the average review.   After passing by DD countless times, usually in favourite of the deliciousness of Square Boy, my friends and I finally decided to drop in for dinner last Friday.   I'd never eaten Hakka before, but we liked the description enough to give it a whirl, ordering everything labelled Hakka from the menu. Now, this was a good idea in principle, but I think we would've been better served asking our server for some guidance.   The good: Manchurian soup. a great hot and sour soup base with chicken. The hot and sour base was less viscous than most (a good thing), but it could have used a little more heat. Overall really tasty.   The bad: Manchurian chicken. I didn't like the consistency of the sauce and the chicken really turned me off. Goopy and spongy isn't good.   The average: everything else we tried. pork spring rolls, sizzling beef and fried paneer, though the latter was a bit above average with the nice green chutney.   The service, as everyone else has mentioned, was great. Very attentive and friendly.   In the end, I'm still going to give it a chance, but this time I'll do so with the assistance of the staff and if you haven't been, I still say you should give it a chance too."}
{"text":"Flavourless food.. Fish manchurian tasteless and lacking in spice...fried rice more like pulao .. Food was cold too.. Staff are friendly though!"}
{"text":"Danforth Dragon has brought the fiery fusion of Indian-Chinese Hakka cuisine (a spicy take on traditional Chinese food that includes the flavours of coriander, chilies and curry) to diners in the Pape & Danforth area since 1999.  Complete with the kitschy decor you'd expect, the Dragon creates a serene oasis for Hakka food-seekers. I've only ever ordered take-out, but regardless of time, day or night, there are always plenty of dine-in customers.  Overall, the dishes are full of flavour, especially if you like a little spicyness with your Chinese food. Personal favorites include the chicken pakoras (succulent pieces of meat mixed with Indian spices & delicately deep-fried), crispy ginger chicken (small chicken bites lightly battered & fried, seasoned with stir-fried garlic, ginger and hot chili, if desired) and the always delicious Szechuan chow mein (thick noodles stir fried with chicken, shrimp, shredded onions, carrots, cabbage, green onion & bean sprouts).  Danforth Dragon is located at 861 Danforth Avenue (@ Danforth and Jones)."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for hakka Chinese, love the place.  Best haka in Toronto so far. Tasty dishes with the right flavors, the prices and quantity don't disappoint either. Decent ambience and sitting space although it seems to be more popular with the take out crowd. I recommend the General Tao chicken and the Spicy crispy beef. The starters are good too, we tried the chicken pakora and loved it. Overall good quality, price and quantity and lovely service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have been the the DD two times now.  Both times the service has been wonderful.  They have a delicious Pakora and a their Ginger Chicken is delightful with a carmalized-like coating.    However, if you are looking for a traditional Chinese place, this is not what you are looking for.  This food is Indian/Chinese and is very different than what you might find at a typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Danforth Dragon since I moved into the area, walked by and was like: WTF is Hakka food!!??!!  Since then I had been intrigued. Fast forward to almost 3 years later and accompanied willing participant to try it out with me (the hubs wouldn't do it...he's all \"Indian chop suey? NO!\".  So with glistening eyes full of temptation and ready to be fulfilled with deliciousness I ordered a noodle dish and my friend ordered some sort of sweet and spicy meat and we dug in.  Whon whaaaaaaa. Its Chinese food. And not even good Chinese food, just okay Chinese food.  I was expecting something a bit more spicy and Indian inspired but I kinda just got a whole lot of China town in my mouth (which on second thought could be kinda gross....hmm). Perhaps the spices were running low in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because we ordered delivery, but I was sorely disappointed! I had such high hopes since this was my first time trying Hakka food. A few people I know have raved about it and I was so excited to try it... however, pretty much everything fell flat. We ordered the Hot & Sour Soup, Crispy Ginger Eggplant, Szechuan Beef, and the Manchurian Shrimp. The food arrived in record time - under 20 minutes! That was great, however, everything was extremely bland. It was okay, but nothing was spicy or even really tasted like anything. I didn't taste any Indian influence anywhere in any of the dishes. It was Chinese food, and not-great Chinese food at that. The Manchurian Shrimp was swimming in a red sauce that should have been super flavourful but - in reality - didn't taste like much. Free ice cream for dessert was a very welcome touch though. I REALLY wanted to like this place, but I doubt we'll be ordering/eating at Danforth Dragon again."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland.  We ordered delivery and everything has no seasoning and we ordered stuff loaded with sauce and ingredients that should have taste.  Even the egg roll had a weird taste like old oil. Only thing good was the steamed rice haha.  Next day i threw all the leftovers in a frying pan and made my own stir fry which tasted way better."}
{"text":"I think the main fault with this restaurant is the size of the menu. I understand that they want to include both Indian and Chinese dishes, but aside from a few hakka dishes, it's largely a Chinese restaurant with an Indian section on this menu. Compared to Hakka Garden for example, the Hakka elements on the menu seem a lot more forced. Going back to the sheer multitude of items on the menu, I think it just makes it impossible to have everything be fresh. The wonton soup (probably a lesser ordered item) was a disaster. Bland broth and stale wontons. Even a generous serving of salt and paper couldn't hide the fact that it was nearly inedible.  Another disappointment was the vegetable stir-fry had this gelatinous, almost lumpy sauce that was kind of tasty in a weird way, but I highly doubt this was the intended execution for the dish. I wasn't impressed by the canned mushrooms it had either.  The pakoras were good (made much better with generous helpings of the chili sauce) and the butter chicken was delicious for the first few bites, but I really don't think it's necessary to deep-fry chicken when it's already in a cream-based sauce.   There are nice touches here, particularly the mango ice cream that they give after the meal, which is unnecessarily generous. It's a nice neighborhood take-out place but it's a little too inconsistent to go frequently."}
{"text":"I have only one word for their food ... \"Bland\". Everything lacked that burst of flavour one would expect from a hakka place.  The only dish that impressed was the crispy egg plant - couldn't stop eating them. Also, I had high expectations for their signature dish of shrimp pakoras but what came were flavourless shrimp that were greasy and void of any flavour (we couldn't tell that it was shrimp at all). When you screw up that badly on your signature dish it is no surprise the rest of the food is quick to follow."}
{"text":"Service was good, prices are ok. It's very worrying that the food came in 2 minutes... And whatever you do don't get the shrimp pakora. Worst butter chicken you will ever eat !!! All chicken was the same."}
{"text":"Super fast take out and delivery. The hakka noodles and crispy ginger beef are the best!"}
{"text":"Close to being the worst Chinese food ever! Crispy chicken was more like dried out and chewy. Singapore noodles were bereft of even a hint of any kind of chicken or shrimp. Some other kind of green bean invention recommended by the person answering the phone was an unwise choice. Shrimp and vegetables dish was competent but flavorless! Overall; YUCK!"}
{"text":"5 stars are for the CRISPY GINGER EGGPLANT!!  This dish is soooo good- it will change your life. Lightly breaded, fried eggplant in a sweet and spicy gingery sauce. GET IT.  I live in the neighbourhood and come here often just to get this eggplant (of course order other dishes too). Noodle dishes are solid, pakoras are SPICY, love the dragon chicken (great cumin/coriander flavour). Waitress is nice too!  Great place to order take out and bring across the street to Only Cafe"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Beer is cheap, food is mediocre. Skip it."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy ginger beef take-out for dinner.  It came with a bowl of rice.  It cost $12.99.  I was surprised by the large portion they packed for us.  I felt that it was too crispy/battered, but overall tasted alright.  I wouldn't mind trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place!  You can request no MSG - no problem.  Love the green beans, the szechuan chicken, the shrimp balls!  Yum."}
{"text":"This place makes pretty delicious food. However, I find it to be pretty expensive and I get frustrated with the way they cut corners. If I'm going to pay $17 for a take out meal, it shouldn't be lacking. I get take out here frequently and I hate how they skimp on things. In my meal last night I received no plum sauce (ordered egg rolls/spring rolls) and one packet of hot sauce for a large dish that hot sauce is essential for. There was also long black hair all over my take out container, but not on the food thankfully. There were no fortune cookies. I've ordered this exact meal before (also before they raised the price) and got all the sauces and the cookies. Just a bit frustrating..."}
{"text":"This place gives the illusion that it will be good Asian food. But that is were it ends. The food is mediocre at best verging on bad. While the restaurant is conveniently located at Jones/Danforth, I would suggest to keep walking until you hit another restaurant."}
{"text":"Not the best hakka food I've ever had. Spicy, but not necessarily as flavourful as I was hoping. Very salty.   Servers were nice. Free ice cream dessert was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place we go all the time. Prices range from 7 to 10 dollars. They have fast and friendly survice. All the orders come with free soup or an eggroll on the side. The plate you're gonna get can feed two. The portions are always huge."}
{"text":"This might not be a high class restaurant, but for cheap, tasty and greasy Chinese food I can't name a better place in the city.  The service is always great, whether it's delivery, pickup or sit-down, and I've yet to try something I don't like here.  I highly recommend the spicy Hakka Egg Rolls, crispy ginger chicken, and chicken pakoras."}
{"text":"I entered the mouth of the dragon full of anticipation but exited very disappointed. Granted I only ordered the Chilli Chicken, but that's the cornerstone of Hakka cuisine. The Chilli Chicken tasted like deep fried chicken in  tasteless brown sauce with some cut green chillies tossed in. It was pretty flavorless except for the spicy chillies. Bah humbug!  Chilli chicken should be a tad garlicky, a tad cumin-y, pepper-y, vinegar-y, onion-y and ergo easily delicious. It's very, very easy to make. Can't believe DD messed this up.   DD if you can't add 1+1, I shudder to think how you are doing multiplication and long division!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out from Danforth Dragon and we ordered:  Chilli chicken - lots of green chilies, great flavours, not too saucy and scrumptious pieces of lightly fried chicken. It's a must order, and one of the best I've had aside from Fredericks. It is spicy, but delicious.  Ginger Crispy Beef - also one of the better ones my husband and I have had. You can taste and see the ginger, perfect amount of sauce coating the fried pieces of beef. If you love crispy ginger goodness, this is your dish!  Hakka chow mein - I love the texture of the noodles, not over-cooked. The chow mein is a bit bland but it does pair well with chilli chicken and crispy ginger beef because of their spice and saltiness.   Shrimp pakoras - my least favorite due to its spongy texture and a flavour profile that I'm not a fan of. However, my husband really enjoyed them.  Overall, five stars for the lady who took my order on the phone, and pick up was friendly and pleasant. The food was amazing, and hands down one of the best chilli chicken's in town! They deserve more stars!!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Seemed more \"Chinese\" than Hakka, but damn, those chicken pakoras really hit the spot!  Cost: -$15-25 for dinner (tax and tip included)  Atmosphere/Decor: -Typical asian decor: drabby but functional.  Ordered: -We asked the owner/chef to make recommendations because it was the first time we had Hakka cuisine.  1. Chicken pakoras - The best thing recommended!  Juicy, fried chicken balls with a crunchy outside and tandoori-esque inside.  2. Fried paneer with green chutney - I generally like paneer dishes,  but this one seemed a bit stale.  3. Crispy ginger chicken - Tasted more like \"General's Tao's\" chicken and had a bit too much breading.    4. Szechuan chowmein - Labelled as a \"Hakka\" dish, but I couldn't taste the curry.  It was more like your standard Chinese noodle dish.  Service: -Owner/chef was friendly and open.  No complaints.  Conclusion: -Overall a good introduction to Hakka cuisine (especially those chicken pakoras), but now I'm really curious to try the \"better\" ones talked about in uptown."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Anthony is a very dedicated and talented chef! In this day and age, where every Hakka restaurant in Toronto is Halal, Danforth Dragon has taken a stand and doesn't do Halal, which is a breath of fresh air. The vegetarian options: home style tofu, Hakka rice, veggie pakoras are the best in town. If you are vegan, there are many, many options, you won't be disappointed!"}
