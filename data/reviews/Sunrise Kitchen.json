{"text":"Best Chinese delivery I've had since New Garden shut down. Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is by far better than all the other Chinese takeout in the area. Also they are the only ones that delivers! The general Taos  chicken here is a must order."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise!  Don't get me wrong its not gourmet but its far from blas√©. The egg rolls and crab rangoons were typical but made perfect. The generals chicken and sesame chicken was great for take out. The place was clean, the prices were fair, and the people were pleasant. We chose this place on a whim and we are very happy we did. I think we just found our new Chinese takeout location."}
{"text":"Lady was very nice charged me a extra dollar to go a little further. Got her fast and hot. Not the best but good! Super small rice container. Most places you get two pints for one price. Will go back, chicken was moist and yummy"}
{"text":"I've had Sunrise Kitchen twice now. The first time, it was 'eh' but it was cheaply priced. The second time around, my food was very greasy and the quality was poor. My delivery order was late, and incorrect. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have ordered delivery from here and the second time that they couldn't find our place. Our order came about an hour and fifteen minutes after we placed it, and when it did, the bag was soaked from our food seeping through. The food is just OK. It's not the worst I've had but certainly not anything special. If they used to serve the sauces on the side, they aren't doing that anymore, which is disappointing since the sauces are heavy and there is too much of it in the entrees."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for \"American-Chinese\" food. I had their food once and I was addicted. Not only that but it was delivered to my door which makes things so easy on you. The eggrolls are excellent, as is the shrimp eggrolls which I absolutely loved!!  I say if you haven't tried this place then you need to. If you live within their delivery area then get it delivered. I just really highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited an 1.5 hrs for food. Called restaurant and they didn't even care the delivery took so long. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The website says they deliver in a four mile radius. I live 3.3 miles from the restaurant (on the same road as the restaurant) and they told me they don't deliver to Hudson. Change your website morons. Anyone stupid enough to turn away a customer for that reason does not deserve my (or your) business."}
{"text":"Sunrise is our go-to Chinese place in Stow, and I have to admit that a large part of that is due to the fact that they deliver! Their food is fairly good for the area.. not too greasy, big selection and they're happy to alter dishes for the truly picky people (me). It's not amazing, either, but again -- for the area, I think it's the best bet. My only real qualm with them is their lack of spice. I'm not really a girl who's hugely into spice -- I like a little heat here and there -- but there is absolutely no heat in any of their dishes, as far as we've seen (and we've tried a fair variety). Even the ones marked with the chili pepper to indicate high spice content don't seem to have more than a dash of red pepper flakes on them. So that's something to keep in mind. Otherwise.. yay Sunrise. :)"}
{"text":"The best Chinese take out around.  We love the tofu vegetable.  Reasonable prices, fast delivery, good portion sizes, delish food!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. I have ordered from them since they opened. They used to offer good food at good prices. I read somewhere that new owners had taken over. The food has become absolutely terrible. Food is often undercooked. The last time I ordered Fried Rice, it was white with peas in it. I am no longer a regular customer and am not sure if I will give them one last chance. Too bad. It used to be my go to for Chinese."}
{"text":"There are is one other Chinese delivery that I know of in my area, and I prefer this one more.   I have ordered from them, both take out and delivery, several times now and have enjoyed it each time. It always is hot and fresh tasting. As far as Chinese food goes, it is pretty typical. Everything is standard and good. I also like that when you order a meal that is typically served fried with sauce (like lemon chicken or sweet and sour anything) they serve the sauce in a separate container. This allows you to drip or drech how you see fit and keeps the fried meat from becoming soggy.   Good portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!    Loved the Kung Pao chicken!  BF likes safer dishes like sweet & sour chicken and sesame chicken.    Next time, I think I will get the shrimp egg foo young or the war su gai- if they are on the menu.    Wonton is delicious- the benchmark to good Chinese!"}
{"text":"I've been forced to get takeout Chinese here ever since Pearl of Hunan closed a few years ago. I wish they would reopen again. Their food is ok, but good only if you need a Chinese fix. There are other Chinese places to go and I'm trying hard to find a take out place that has good food."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese take out food goes, Sunrise Kitchen was pretty standard.  Same food as most other places.  General Tso's chicken was tasty.  Little spicier than other places though.  Egg Rolls were large and tasty, just the way I like them.  Crab rangoons and sweet and sour were same as most other places in the area, but oh so good.  Overall as good as anywhere else in the area.  Worth a look."}
{"text":"My family and I used to love this place ! New owners have taken over and the food is awful and tasteless. We have tried three times since the new people took over and it's awful each time. Was hoping they would improve and gave them a few months but after tonight's meal it's time to look for a new Chinese place."}
{"text":"Super sweet people running the place, quick service, and really really good ma po tofu. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese in stow. Nothing really special about it, but it's typical American Chinese food. They deliver but it takes a while. The online order for delivery or pickup is very convenient and they run specials too. Quick in restaurant service. Everything comes out hot."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online and was given a time of 40-60min. I wasn't in a hurry for it to come so I was pleasantly surprised when I got a knock on my door less than 20min later!  The food itself was your typical American Chinese fare. It all arrived almost too hot to eat! I had to let the egg-drop soup cool down for a bit first but it good. The fried rice and spring rolls were good as well. They gave a ton of side sauces and a couple of fortune cookies.   Definitely the cheapest Chinese option around, well worth your money!"}
{"text":"I'm not only disappointed by the quality of the food but the service here there is little to be desired. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
