{"text":"Tried to take some out of town guests to one of Gastonia's \"better\" restaurants.  Horribly disappointed.  Food was tasteless, cold, and overpriced.  Service was some of the rudest I have ever experienced.  Not going to waste my time with details.  Just don't go here."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to enjoying Sushi with my family. We drove many miles to celebrate some good grades.   Chef was cordial but not open to creating anything new. Rolls were OK, rather small in comparison to the bars we have frequented. The sign to leave came when my daughter went to pick a piece of rice up with her chop sticks and it moved. Yes, a worm was making it's way around the plate.   To their credit the chef and management was clear bothered. They offered a modest discount and said Thank you.   Would you go back? We probably will not. I have heard and seen many good responses about Lotus and can see the attraction. I wish we still had it"}
{"text":"Great food,  Great service plus very reasonable prices to top it off. The menu has a lot of choices and caters to both vegetarians and non vegetarians. We had the sushi and were rather pleased, will come back again."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed great food from NY to Florida and From Venice to Athens from Washington DC to Seattle Washington and much in between. Lotus has provided excellent food on par with all of the above! I live a mile or so from Lotus and my bride and I have enjoyed many Sushi lunch dates (love the Heba deMango) , many dinner dates with many fabulous dishes. The BBQ pork loin, Grits and Fried green tomatoes are awesome. Butter Nut soup and Raviolis are amazing! Cedar plank salmon awesome! The beer list.....adventurous. The wine choices are fabulous and as good as your knowledge and budget. Vance and Lyndsey know their stuff. Great venue for business dinners. There is very little competition is G Town for sure and I rank Lotus up there with many venues in Clt etc. Nicks and the new Tavern 24 have good food. Service and atmosphere ok. no Sushi though. Jia decent but Sushi not as good as Lotus! Service at Lotus is great 70%, good 20% and fair 10% of the time. Anyone has a bad day sometimes. I've had cold soup occasionally and wished more Raviolis came with my order but overall I am rarely disappointed! Josh thank you for your service. Barry and Angela thank you for this establishment (and Sakura's. I miss several menu items from Fuji too btw). Keep up the good work. Press on for excellence even more. Bring back that Venisen loin chop, cranberry remulade, and garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus special soon! Later Docrock!"}
{"text":"Lately, poor service. Have to wonder if they are riding on their past good reputation and letting things slide. Hope they pick things back up."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Gastonia area IMHO.  Great sushi and original menu/dishes.  Consistently excellent food."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and the service is okay. I ordered Sushi for dinner, the California Roll and the spicy salmon tools.  They were pretty tasty. They have a wide selection of beer and wine. I also had their Mexican firing squad mixed drink being a tequila liver. It's quite tasty. The place has a unique architecture and very nice atmosphere. I ordered the chocolate Pecan pie for desert. A bit more chocolate than expected and the pecans were a bit soft. If you like sushi and looking for a spot close by you can give this place a try."}
{"text":"OMG the sushi is awesome. The rest of the food I incredible too. The flatbreads pizzas are great. Who would of thought BBQ pork over grits but Wow it's good."}
{"text":"Finally!  A cool restaurant in Gastonia!  I just stopped in tonight to sample the atmosphere and a couple of cocktails.  As luck would have it, I had the opportunity to meet the owners, and they are really nice people!  They even took the time to explain the different grades of Saki to me, and offered some samples.  My only regret is that I didn't find this place sooner!  I will be back for a full dinner soon.  It's great to see an independently owned and operated restaurant in town!  F.Y.I.  they also have a take-out menu!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, but service is slow and management is really slack. I've seen the owner's son/manager take up a seat at the bar on his laptop while the bar staff is in the weeds and we're waiting forever to get a drink. My wife and I have been going on a regular basis for years, but our last visit will likely be just that. We walked in on a Friday night, just ahead of two larger parties. We were just going to have cocktails and sushi, so I asked the hostess if there were any tables available in the bar area. She said I was welcome to look. WTF? Isn't that her job? So we walk around the corner to look and there are no seats. We walk back to the hostess and now she's busy with the other groups. We ended up walking out and going to Hickory Tavern. We asked the hostess there if there were any seats on the patio, and she said, \"wait, let me go check.\" I looked at my wife and said, that's what the hostess is supposed to do! Service was 100 times better, too. Lotus is good if you don't mind being ignored."}
{"text":"I been going here since they open up. All of time food is great. Service on other hand is hit and miss. Today was major turn down.  After eating lunch we try to order molten cake but server said kitchen is close after slow service from her."}
{"text":"Wow, truly impressed! Being from NYC, we can be quite snobby when it comes to food :) but not only was everything we ordered absolutely amazing, the service was beyond exemplary! We arrived after a 2.5 hr photo shoot with two toddlers (yeah imagine that) to celebrate my mom's bday. Once our server realized how starved the kiddos were, we had three people helping us and food out for the babies in no time. Not to mention even a basic cheese pizza was really really good, sushi out of this world!  After a few minor spills and no complaining from the staff, which I really appreciated since I was super tired myself, thank you again for my awesome mom you rock dessert! So if yoù're looking for a hidden gem in tiny Gastonia-look no more!!!"}
{"text":"I got the BBQ and my wife got the salmon!! So delicious!! Now we are just waiting on dessert. My wife is getting the Caramel Creme' Brûlée and I am getting the Chocolate Molten Cake!! We can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Came here in late August.  The beer selection is wide and they have craft as well as your usual beers they also had a large selection of wine but didnt have enough time to try those too.  Sushi was delicious and the combinations were appetizing such as tuna and mango and so on.  The entrees are also very good we had steak frites, lotus vegetarian, potstickers and a few other dishes all delicious but the ine named stood out.  the steak frites come with a very fresh and yummy salad and the steak is cooked to perfection and pre sliced for you allyou have to do is enjoy.  The potstickers were so amazing we had to order another one to satisfy our tastebuds.  They are panfried to just the right crispy texture and the chili sauce is sweet and savory to the point i was looking for bread to wipe the sauce clean so not to waste a drop.  Lotus vegetarian you don't have to be vegetarian to love it especially if you like fried green tomatoes you'll enjoy this.  I was so full I wrapped the leftovers and ate it at room temp for breakfast the next morning and it was still just as yummy and not even soggy even though it was fried.  Service is friendly and ambiance is trendy ,great for date night or dinner with coworkers or friends."}
{"text":"Given the selection of restaurants in Gastonia, this one stands out among the rest.  At first I read the tagline of \"modern American comfort food\" and imagined steak and potatoes or mac and cheese, you get the drift.  Imagine my surprise when I perused the menu and found dishes like \"shrimp 'n grits with bok choy\" next to butternut squash ravioli next to orange duck spring rolls.  A very diverse menu offering with a little American, a little Asian, and a little fusion to satisfy everyone's cravings.  I decided on a sushi dinner and enjoyed a bountiful offering of fresh fish.  The sashimi was sliced a little thick, but hey, I can't complain about getting lots of fish!  The tuna tataki was lightly seared with a peppery crust.  YUM!  There was also a large selection of beverages.  The beers were from all over the world and like the food menu, had something for everyone.  All in all, a great place for groups or indecisive people.  Great meal, great company, it was definitely a memorable meal in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Being a sushi fanatic, when a friend took me to Lotus for lunch before hiking, I had high hope.The place is well decorated. Sushi was good but it was a little high in price. May be I come back, but I'm not in rush."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant two or three times while in town on business. Very relaxing atmosphere but as other reviews point out, very dark and difficult to read the menu at times. Always received good service with a friendly smile. Excellent selection of beer and wine from the bar. The menu provides multiple options from appetizers through desserts. Always felt like I had two or three things I wanted to try each time I was there. Most recently, I tried the artichoke dip appetizer with the crabcake entrée. Very satisfying. Overall - I would return again and recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Gastonia. A little pricey but because of this we have never had to wait for a table like every other restaurant in Gastonia on the weekend.   I normally go for the sushi which is awsome have had other dishes as well, Salmon, Kobe burger. Everything was great. Service is great."}
{"text":"Talk about pleasantly surprised! My wife and I were in town for a conference and were having less and average luck the last few nights for a good restaurant with food and drink. Lotus couldn't have been a better surprise when we saw they offered sushi and had a great locals draft list! Talk about a score! We both ordered 3-4 rolls each, ordering exclusively from the sushi menu, and had a few IPAs to wash them down. Lotus was a clean, fun, decorative spot that is unassuming from the outside but packs a wonderful treat for dinner and drinks! If we ever end up in Gastonia again, we will be looking this place back up!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place is now our favorite brunch place. Lotus is relatively close to our house, yet we have felt compelled to venture to Charlotte and dine at various other sushi and brunch (among other places) places often.   I'm not sure what we were thinking. Lotus stands up to the best places we've had sushi and brunch. Their sushi is simple (as traditional sushi is supposed to be) and not 'Americanized' like the sushi you'd find at places like Cowfish. However they do have some unconventional sushi rolls I would deem 'Americanized' and do enjoy them as well. I still prefer simple.  Back to brunch...we will definitely be returning for it"}
{"text":"I have been twice since we a customer near Gastonia.  This would be a 3 in Cincinnati or a larger city, but because of the limited selection in Gastonia I give it a 4.  It's a nice place, newer, good bar, and have an outside eating area.  The food is a sort of Asian-Southern fusion.  They have an extensive sushi menu, but we did not order sushi either time we went.  We have had the following appetizers:  pot stickers - average/don't believe they are made from scratch, orange duck spring rolls - average, crab cake - good but small portion, and the butternut squash ravioli - very good!  Both entrees I have ordered were very good, and if I had to pick a favorite it would be the shrimp & grits.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, and topped with a shrimp Asian salad & citrus butter sauce.  The shrimp & grits is delicious.  The grits were creamy & loaded with cheese, and this is served with baby bok choy that I really liked."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The sushi is amazing!!!! And so is the rest of the menu. They have everything from flat bread pizza, burgers, pasta, and sushi. The drinks are a little pricey $$$ but no complaints otherwise"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly unfortunately that's the only thing positive to say. The appetizers I had were bland (egg rolls, and shrimp tacos and somewhat over priced for quality and portion size, However I heard the sushi was good maybe one day I'll try that."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's day. Had actually wanted to go to Webb custom kitchen but it was closed. This was open, yay! I'm glad it was! First off, the bread with the olive oil and touch of balsamic was delicious!! Not many restaurants give bread anymore! We tried the smoked mussels as an appetizer. OMG!!! They were some of the best mussels I've had! Had a delicious smoky flavor. It comes with toasted bread that is great to dip in the delicious gravy! Yummy! I even used the bread they brought out initially to soak up that gravy!!! I decided to try the miso soup. I was fooled because I had some delicious miso soup in DC a few weeks ago and thought it might be good. It was just so so.... That's why I took off one star.  We were not that hungry so decided to share the half chicken. They split it for us thankfully. It was really good, I love skin on chicken and this was no exception! Yummy!  I have been dreaming of those mussels since that day! I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Living near by, my family and I eat/drink at Lotus regularly.  Don't be turned off by the fact that it is located in a strip mall.  Once inside, the atmosphere is inviting.....modern, comfortable decor that doesn't try too hard, a great place for a date, drinks with friends, or dinner.    Let's start with drinks:  Lotus tends to hire very good bartenders, and I have rarely had a drink here that wasn't great.  I really enjoy the Grand Margarita, and the Tai Boxer (after dinner).  My husband enjoys their wide variety and ever-changing selection of beers. I have also had great mojitos and dirty martinis.    Food:  excellent, excellent, excellent.  Great sushi, great shrimp and grits, fabulous flatbread pizzas, best ever watermelon salad.  The menu changes seasonally, and I have never had anything that wasn't great.  Every single soup of the day I have tried has been expertly prepared and flavorful. I have tried most of the apps and enjoyed them all.  Caesar salad with anchovies is terrific as is the iceberg wedge salad.   Service:   This is my only negative point.  The service at Lotus is GREAT sometimes and below average other times.  If I didn't enjoy the place so much I would not tolerate the level of service.  The wait staff is always friendly and hard-working.  It is obvious it is an issue of understaffing by management.    All in all, Lotus is one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Happenstance brought me and my husband in on what was the beginning of our vacation but a family obligation kept us in town that night. So happy to have been in Lotus' parking lot! We had the best crab cake that I've had since being at the Gulf. Even the greens were delicious! Then we had the white Flatbread pizza and I've never liked bacon on pizza but took a chance because I wanted the ricotta and so glad I did! It was very delicious. I can't wait to go back especially after the vegetarian with bok choy and jasmine rice and the smoked pork over grits was exemplary! Too full for any dessert. So next time perhaps we'll eat dessert first and try their potstickers I've heard so much about!"}
{"text":"What a gem in Gastonia! We had the Lotus Roll with a side of bok choy and a 9 piece order of Sashimi. The sushi chef was phenomenal! The presentation was gorgeous and the food equally delicious. Highly recommend dining at Lotus...and order from the Sushi menu! Forgot to mention that their beer selection is limitless (or at least it seemed like it)."}
{"text":"Lotus is one of my favorite restaurants. Great servers, and consistently good food no mater what time of day. Try the artichoke dip, and white pizza..!"}
{"text":"Pretentious, expensive, and you WILL leave hungry. That's about all there is to say about this establishment.    The portions are small and came out cold, I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was completely... gross. The shrimp was cold and the grits were mushy. The presentation was lovely but I want my food to look AND taste good.   This place might've been redeemed had it not been for the uppity waitstaff that didn't bother to take our drink orders for 20 minutes and then never refill our glasses, not even once. They weren't even busy! It just blows my mind how you can have 5-7 waiters and waitresses standing around not even trying to get a good tip.   So anyway, pretentious, expensive and bereft of substance."}
{"text":"I ordered and picked up a couple a starters, entrees and desserts to have a romantic dinner at home with my wonderful wife and was not disappointed.  The meal was perfectly prepared and cooked.  It was also ready at the time they said it would be."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Absolutely the worse dinning experience one can have. I ask the waiter to recommend a Cabernet or  Merlot wine, he walked away and came back with a glass of red wine (?) suggestion? As I swirled the glass, my hand felt a crusty coating surrounding the glass. Held it to the light..filthy. The 34 minute wait from after consuming the appetizer, until the main meal arrived was unacceptable. No water service or check in from the waiter. No lighting in the bar dinning area except tea lights. I had to use my phone to illuminate the menu. Other guest did as well. The place was not busy, yet service was awful..  Great place to retire as it may be that long before you see either the waiter or your food. Eat elsewhere. Coal miners lamp required."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  We always choose Lotus for special occasions or a romantic dinner.  The food is amazing quality, the service is always amazing and there just isn't anywhere else like it in town.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance was excellent. This new restaurant will definitely stand the test of time if they maintain this standard of food and service."}
{"text":"I come to Gastonia area frequently for business and should've written this review long ago as its my personal favorite.  An incredibly eclectic mix of dishes well prepared with fresh ingredients. try a sushi appetizer, an edamame course, followed by shrimp with grits.  Service is friendly and attentive. Amazing martini menu. The cucumber one I am still trying to duplicate!  No competition in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"This place a little upscale  food is awesome I just wished  they did a brunch  in saturday maybe one day service on point give it a try"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times.  Would eat here more, but it is a little too pricey.  The name makes me think of a Chinese or Japanese place.  The tag line of 'modern American comfort food' is not very inviting.  The interior is classy and comfortable.  I was wearing a tshirt the first time I dined and felt out of place among men with suits and polo shirts.  Since then, I at least have a polo shirt on. Usually it is not very crowded.  Makes me wonder how they stay in business.  The food has always been very good to top notch.  I have eaten filet mignon at many restaurants and this is the best I have ever had.  Delicious and melts into your mouth. Ruth Chris and Morton's weren't even in the same league.  Salad is unique, but still very good.  Staff has at most times been attentive and usually the manager stops by to make sure everything is alright."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend.  Ordered the potstickers & duck spring rolls as appetizers.  The duck spring rolls were just okay; but the potstickers were VERY VERY good.  We will definitely order those again!  I was skeptical about ordering the shrimp n grits (which came with bok choy --- seemed an odd combination), but boy am I glad I did it!  The grits were creamy & cheesy.  The shrimp was plentiful - and very tasty.  The sauce it was cooked in (they call it a 'sesame' sauce) is what brought the 3 ingredients together - the shrimp, grits, and bok choy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this meal was.  Everything was cooked just right.  Boyfriend ordered the 'sliced' bbq pork.  This, too, was not what we expected.  We thought it was going to be - literally - sliced pork (like what we normally see in bbq places).  But it turned out to be these 2 \"pulled pork bbq cakes\".  So the pork is actually pulled pork - that they shaped into a \"cake\", and then sliced the cake into 2 pieces.  The bbq pork is very tender, very flavorful, and they give you a generous portion.  This one came with cheese grits & green beans (which were cooked southern style - like the overcooked/soft kind).  Very, very good.  We dined with friends, who apparently come here often, and they ordered sushi.  These friends are into organic & healthy eating, so if they like the sushi here, it must be very good.  The only not-so-pleasant experience was the service.  It was extremely slow that evening.  Luckily none of us were super hungry, or in a bad mood, so we didn't let the slow service ruin our dining experience.    3 stars for the service, but definitely 4 stars for the food."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I've been twice now and each time has been exceptional. The wait staff seems to truly enjoy their jobs and they show it in how they describe their own favorite dishes. We had a bottle of wine that was phenomenal and never would have tried it if our waitress hadn't recommended it.   My date wanted a ribeye, but they only had sirloin or hanger steak that night. He ordered the hanger, but the waitress came back and said they had something they were aging for next week (I can't remember what it was) that was closer to ribeye. He got that and said to make it \"medium rare to medium.\" It couldn't have been more perfect! We told the waitress we wanted to give the chef a high-five and a couple minutes later the chef came out for exactly that. It was so much fun!   You can tell the people here are truly talented and passionate about what they do. Please please support them!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The owners are wonderful people and nurture their guests.  The menu is a combination of sushi/Thai/Asian and American bistro. The bar is a great place to hang with friends and even to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"Great service and, as always, the food was delicious. New Year's Eve and the place was packed. Our server was inundated but was smart enough to ask for our help sorting things out. Certainly was not an issue. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing so many positives. All I got to say is crap will not be back. Brunch country breakfast and eggs Benedict tasteless the hash browns basically potato all under cooked and hard in the middle. Coffee was burnt and Undrinkable. I got my food before my coffee don't know how that happens. Place needs a clean sprucing up and a decent chef or cook. Avoid"}
{"text":"A group of co-workers and I visited Lotus while on business in Kings Mountain, NC. Lotus is located, seemingly, in the middle of nothing in a developing strip mall. There are 2 other hip places around (bar and grill and wine shop). We were sat quickly and our waitress was very patient with our party of mostly Spanish speakers. They have a great beer and wine selection, a menu with seafood, salad, and local meat, along with a separate sushi menu. The food was wonderful, however the soups were not great.  My miso soup was a little artificial tasting and (due to a miscommunication) my coworker sent back her chilled split pea soup. It should be noted that the owner immediately came out to check on us and ensure that the unique soup was described to my coworker as such when she ordered it. She made no fuss about the return, just wanted to make sure her staff was doing their job.  Overall, the experience was very nice and the sushi was Great! I will be back when work brings me back to the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  service and food.  the sauce is what makes the spring rolls (otherwise they are just ok), but check out the beautiful pic of the big - eye tuna.  the rice is flavored wonderfully.   for a lighter dessert,  be sure to try the green tea creme brulee."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Friendly staff and fun atmosphere. Wide selection of craft beers and good wine. Sushi is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Gastonia area. My husband and I have been going here since we were seniors in high school. The sushi is the only thing we ever get but it is amazing. All of their rolls are phenomenal. The staff is friendly and the service is fast! This place is one of the only things I miss about Gaston County."}
{"text":"I had not been in the restaurant for some time, service had deteriorated. I had lunch recently and it was excellent! The server, Joshua was outstanding - attentive, knowledgeable and seemed to be handling several tables very effectively.  The pot stickers were spot on! The flavor was perfect with a very complimentary sauce.  A lot of other items on the menu to \"retry\"."}
{"text":"I'm filing this one under one of the best meals I've ever had. I'm 30 and fat. I've had a lot of meals.  A friend and I were in town from Nashville to visit Carowinds and I basically just looked up restaurants near our hotel. This one popped up and the menu looked great. Variety, fusion, unique.  First of all, it may be in a strip mall, but the ambiance is wonderful inside. We sat down, tired from a day of driving and were promptly greeted by our waiter. I always try to eat and drink local when traveling so I asked him what local brews they had. Unfortunately, the only local brews on tap were IPAs, but they did have a Charlotte-made pale ale, Jam Session, and it was awesome.  We couldn't decide on one appetizer, so we got two. potstickers and spring rolls. They. Were. Delicious. It was the sauce that topped the potstickers that made them extremely unique. Some of the best I've had. The peanut sauce accompanying the springs rolls was perfect and had a little kick to it. Very unique.  Since we were both craving grits, we each got the BBQ pork. What a great-sized portion. It came with two slabs of BBQ pork and the sauce was sweet (our waiter even told us it'd be on the sweet end, just in case we didn't like that kind of sauce). The pork was on top of cheese grits (phenomenal), along with green beans and sided with fried green tomatoes. What an awesome, southern dish.   We loved it so much that we actually filled out the comment cards and handed them to the hostess. I'd love to go back the next time in town and try the sushi. But what a unique restaurant that we were able to enjoy Asian and southern cuisine in the same place!"}
{"text":"You would never expect a place like this to exist in Gastonia, and yet it does. (No offense Gastonia, but you're heavy on the chain restaurants!). High ceilings swallow you up into a very romantic, classy dining room. Beautifully put together menus = works of art. The drinks - an extensive drink menu that includes hand crafted cocktails (wanna try Absinthe with a flaming sugar cube?), wines and a two page beer menu (even a selection of bombers). I had an Abita Black IPA off the tap and a Hi Wire Contortionist Black IPA - great selection! My wife loved her Midori Pina Colada on the rocks. The sushi - did not try this time - but they do have a full sushi menu from basic rolls to Ngiri sushi. The food - Potstickers ($7) - good with a Thai Chili sauce. Baby Bok Choy side ($3) - simply awesome - cooked perfectly. Shrimp Carbonara (Daily Special $24) - incredible sauce but the shrimp were overcooked and a bit tough. Chilean Sea Bass (Daily Special $31) - just okay - wasn't blown away - had potatoes and jasmine rice (one too many starches and the delicacy of the jasmine was lost with the other flavors) - peppers - cherry tomatoes - orange sections - and then dressed up like a macaw with a frisee salad. A little over the top for my personal tastes. The Bass itself did not have a pleasant texture - too moist and soggy/mushy. Almost like it was partly grilled/partly poached or sous vide. The kitchen did confirm it was 100% grilled. The last ten times I've had grilled Sea Bass, it was firm moist, delicious and totally different from this.  The dessert menu looked great, but alas no room. Our server, Kari, a fellow New Yorker was a great tour guide for the evening and took really good care of us. Nicely done! Compared with the standard menu items/prices, I thought the specials were a little too pricey. An Alfredo with Shrimp is only $17 and the standard Big Eye Tuna Dish $26. Had the dishes been stellar I might not be complaining, but a Special had really better be Special indeed - or at least quote the prices when you read the specials unless you find it tacky. I don't personally mind it - it helps me make a value choice when I'm teetering on making an entree selection and I have a good idea of what market price is. I think this place is neat and has a lot of potential. I rate it 3.5 stars but will round up due to our great server. If/when I return, it will probably be for lunch and more of their beers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, EXCELLENT service, and the food was absolutely amazing. It is a bit on the pricy side, but you get what you pay for! It had a great ambiance and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"First thing you need to do when you walk in the door here is ask for Josh, trust me on this. Tell him the Stricklands sent you to him. Not many places to eat a decent meal here Gastonia but this is the exception. Wife and I usually eat here once a week. Sushi is good, the specials are usually very tasty. I haven't had a bad one yet. When they have the Chilean Sea Bass, get it. You won't be disappointed. The filet over mushroom risotto is one of my favorites. Pot stickers here are very tasty. The only negative, the bread. Good starter bread is cheap, and can sometimes make the difference between a new customer ever coming back, glad we weren't in the group. Good place to eat, bottom line."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and they always have unique beers on tap."}
{"text":"One of our go to places for a quiet couple time.  We went Sat. Night planning on sitting at the bar and having some \"us\" time.  Typically busy...but service was challenging. My husband is not a \"craft\" beer person.  Just normal would be a better description. No domestic beers? At least none listed or available at the bar. He was not happy.  Bummer for me too, because I like mixed drinks. Manhattans are my thing but the new generation Bartenders have to put a twist on everything. So I order something real basic. Tullamore Dew on the rocks with cherries.  Only Irish Whiskey is Jameson.  Sigh.  Ok..let's go with scotch.  She is new so I did tell her which was Glen Fiddich and which was Glen Livet.  I survived but I was disappointed to settle for something else...hubby was disappointed because he couldn't get a Killian's or Bud Light.  Appetizers and Desserts were fine, but was bummed because I like coming here for the atmosphere and food.  Don't know if I can talk hubby back if there's nothing for him to drink.  Either the bartender didn't know her selection or they've weeded out the normal.  Still a great place for food...just will have to drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love a place where the owner also bartends on occasion. We found this spot on TripAdvisor, and drove 2 miles off the main highway to try it out. Great food, relaxing atmosphere - well thought out. Support local business and skip the chains. Well worth the few extra dollars."}
{"text":"I will try to make this short (but sweet).  Had a business meeting/dinner scheduled (not by me) at my place of business on a Sunday evening for ten people...can I tell you how difficult it was to find ANY RESTAURANT open in Belmont or nearby Gastonia on a Sunday night, much less have it delivered??!!  My work site has no kitchen facilities, no warming oven to help facilitate the dining process...I was anticipating a cold, boring dinner from a chain restaurant, as there were few options.  But then I saw that The Lotus was open on Sunday evenings...Vance in events at The Lotus was fabulous with listening to my tale of woe, making suggestions as to the best way to work a dinner for (10) people with a lack of facilities, and went the extra mile to make suggestions for food that would work best with the situation.  And Chef Evan personally delivered our meal to us, ensuring that everything was kept warm and ready to serve upon arrival.  It was a great meal, simple but fabulous, which was exactly what the situation called for.    Thanks Vance, Chef Evan and everyone at The Lotus who contributed to making my business dinner a great success, kicking off a fabulous three-day meeting! Kat Oo."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I try to make it to this restaurant! The decor is so charming! And the drinks are delicious. They have the best side car I've ever had and I'm always disappointed when other bars can't make it as well! The turkey burger is my favorite item on the menu! Staff has always been prompt and polite. Love to visit!!"}
{"text":"Food came out cold. The chicken for the salad looked like microwaveable chicken that hadn't even been heated up. Since there was a wedding party upstairs everything ran behind for the regular customers service. They blamed the horrible service and wait on the wedding party. A business should expect and be prepared for that sort of thing. The only reason we came here was because hickory tavern was closed."}
{"text":"Up until this week, I had only eaten dinner here before, so I was very skeptical about the lunch menu. But I will be making a return visit very soon.  Even though I'm not a sushi fanatic, they do have an excellent sushi menu & it seems to be quite popular. Their lunch menu also has flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, paninis, pasta dishes, & some other assorted dishes. I had one of the flatbread pizzas, tried one of my girlfriend's pasta dishes,& they were both quite good. So count me as shocked at the goodness of their lunch menu, for which I'll definitely be returning.  As for the atmosphere, it lends itself towards the upscale almost date night scene, more inclined to dinner. It has a modern feel within the restaurant, & they do have a separate bar area with some nice nooks to sit in. The patio is also nice, but being in a shopping center really doesn't help with the views (all parking lot).   So Lotus shocked me with their lunch menu & I'll be going back soon to try out some of the other items."}
{"text":"Visited this eatery a few days ago for the first time ever.  American cuisine with your choice of Asian flair or plain old down home goodness, including a fresh sushi bar. Set in a small plaza of sorts, I wasn't expecting a whole lot in the way of ambiance, but the place had a upscale, industrial kind of decor in my opinion. You don't think it's a very big place until you look up and see another floor of seating over the sushi bar.  Our server, Caitlin, was amazing, anticipating needs, suggesting specific drinks, appetizers and entrees based on the different individuals' preferences.  The shrimp bisque was very good, with plenty of small pieces of shrimp in a delicately seasoned soup base.  Small slices of bread were served with oil and a balsamic vinegar for dipping, a take off on the herbs and olive oil you get plenty of places, but I liked it.  One of the people in our party had the special watermelon salad which had mixed greens, citrus, and feta cheese.  It was a very big salad but since she shared a taste or two, the plate was clean when it went back to the kitchen.  I had the house special sushi roll which had crab meat, avocado, cream cheese, and more wrapped in rice and a nori wrapper, then wrapped in a very thin layer of salmon and lightly fried.  It was served, of course, with the usual wasabi and soy sauce, but I could have very easily eaten it without any additional condiments and been very happy.  It was exquisite.  The special of the day was a pan seared grouper served over a bed of dressed up jasmine rice.  It looked very good and the two who ordered it were pleased with their choice.    I on the other hand was \"not at all happy with my choice\" as described above, but only because I also wanted to order the house shrimp and grits, the salmon that was at the top of the menu, and the grouper special.  That being said, the only real reason I was unhappy was because I couldn't have a little bit of everything I wanted to try, and a little bit of everything everyone else in the dining room was having.  It all looked divine.  I definitely have to go back there soon to try the salmon, or the shrimp or grits, or grouper, or.....oh, I'm afraid this place will know me by my first name very soon."}
{"text":"Cool place, that is hidden, and not well advertised, or I don't pay attention. Found it at random.  Went in close to closing time, and  sat at the sushi bar, and the older Asian man behind brought me out some cucumber thing after I expressed I worked 10 hours on my feet and I was starving. It was an explosion of so many flavors my pallet was both delighted, and confused. After witnessing this culinary delight, I told him to make whatever he wanted with some allergy guidelines. I was sooooo happy with this choice. I am mad I didn't take a picture.  It was so wonderful, and creative. I'm not even sure what was in it either. Tuna, eel, and whatever else was arranged in a beautiful, and artistic manner that danced along my taste buds.  I know how lame that sounds but  it was like that! The price was decent for what I tasted. It was also filling for sushi.   Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the pot stickers and the Lotus panini with fries. The fries were really good. I would eat those again. The other food was ok...not bad..but nothing to go gaga over.  They had good service. I will give them that."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying this has to be one of Gastonia's hidden gems. We came out for Hubs birthday and wanted to try something that we've never tried before. I was pleased to see that they had a true vegetarian/nearly vegan option on the menu and it was amazeballs!! (Yes, I just used that word, lol).  Lotus vegetarian was a mixture of tempeh wrapped w/ carrots, sweet onions, red peppers all pan crisped with the side of coconut jasmine rice, baby bok choy, sake butter sauce and a side of chili garlic dipping sauce (mouth watering now). And the interesting thing about the evening was that it was not the highlight of the restaurant. OMG the WINE and BEER list is bananas...B-A-N-A-N-A-S. The wine list is about as thick as the National Enquirer with far better content. And the beer list had Hubs impressed and he tripped out when our waiter told him the beer list changes with the seasons. What!?! Drop the mic! The prices were a little more on the $$1/2 side, so this is not an every week visit. However, we will be back maybe just to get some of those cinnamon glazed donuts that the chef comps hubs for his birthday. The glaze has a dash of whiskey and it adds another dimension to the flavor which brings out the cinnamon flavor. (Hell, anything with a dash of whisky is good). Well worth the visit! Fine dining in the Gas-House??? Yep...it's reality!!"}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the waitress was rude. We didn't complain about food and we left a great tip, but as we were leaving I overheard the waitress and another waiter talking about us. I felt like they was very unprofessional and I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Interesting place. We were in the area and this place was recommended to us. I was surprised it was in a shopping center. We came in for lunch and there was no one inside as far as customers and it looked like they were still getting ready to open.   We ended up getting seated. We didn't get greeted for a while. We waited a bit. While we were waiting, we were looking at the menu. It's a random range from sushi to sandwiches, salads, flatbreads, etc. The server finally greeted us and he seemed super frazzled. We asked him a question and he was unsure and walked off and started yelling asking the chef something. He came back and answered us. We placed our orders. A few other tables came in and it seems like every time the server had a question, he would start yelling in the dining area as he was walking in the kitchen.   I got the sushi. It was surprisingly good. It was fresh and delicious. My husband got the chicken panini and fries. Our friends got salads and sushi and also a panini. Overall, we were pretty happy with our food."}
{"text":"This is \"the place\" to try in Gastonia. I've been 5-6 times and have never been disappointed. The thing that awe great I particular is the House roll, filet, shrimp and grits, duck egg roll appetizer... I could go on but u get the point. The only downside is no kids menu so we have to save it for date night. Definitely try it esp if you have family or friends to impress from out of town."}
{"text":"Great service, nice ambiance, and the best sushi I've had in the Charlotte/ Gastonia area.  The staff is always very kind and knowledgeable.  I've never had to wait around for a table.  I really love this place!"}
{"text":"We just had lunch here today. This place is excellent. Started with the pot stickers which were delicious. I had the Lotus Panini and fries. Very good. I also ordered a Pesto Roll off the sushi menu which was amazing. Pesto is my favorite flavor to add to anything so I was going to like this either way. It was VERY good. Our waitress (sorry I don't remember her name) was awesome too.  I definitely recommend this place and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous, period.  Although we normally enjoy the dinner specials, the regular menu is a solid offering of unique fare.  If you are a beer, wine or cocktail enthusiast, you will not be disappointed.  I especially enjoy the selection of 18 craft beers on draft!  Try the Kobe burger and sauteed spinach, which is my fave!"}
