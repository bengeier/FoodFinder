{"text":"The pizza is not my favourite, but their authentic sammy's are to die for. The steak is as tender as you can get and the buns are always fresh. The pasta is great too. Staff are always so friendly, even at their busiest. Love this place !!"}
{"text":"I frequent Tony & Nick's place quite often .... they make a decent veal sandwhich.  Its not the best I've ever had, but for the price, it isn't bad.  The owners are very nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"Awesome steak sandwiches!!  Always come here for the steak on a bun with fries and gravy. The whole sandwich is completely edible, unlike some steak sandwich places. Very proper food here. They also have other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"I really only get the hot steak and chesse here  . Its good ill say that but by no means great lol. If you want a somewhat cheap sandwich made quickly then this is a good place.  As for the pizza. ..its cheap you get what you pay for...only reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 is that even when I order my sandwich hot they only put 1 maybe 2 peppers if im lucky . Long story short cheap food when you're hungry. Fyi do not order the hamburger, it's by far the worst burger ive ever ordered"}
{"text":"Great, cheap veal sandwiches. Sometimes a bit messy and covered in sauce, but really that's what you want from a veal sandwich, isn't it?"}
{"text":"This place is no California Sandwich but when I walk in for a veal sandwich that's just all of a sudden ready so quickly... A and I get home to find its barely warm...I realize this place sold me someone else's order after they failed to show up.  
I have only one thing to say to Nick and Tony: if you wanted to save $7 bucks by selling me leftover crap, think about the $hundreds you've lost in my current and future business.  I'm never coming back here to this unethical establishment."}
{"text":"Loved the panzarotti. It's bigger then the ones in Italy I used to eat but tastes exactly how I remember them.   loaded with cheese! Loved it."}
{"text":"I was in the area and felt like trying somewhere new for a veal sandwich.  I've had them from the more frequented places in the area, but a coworker suggested this place.  Anyways the place is definitely a takeout place, no seating area and a few tables inside to stand and eat.  It took about 10 minutes from the time I ordered until I got my food.  I wasn't disappointed.  For only $7.00 the sandwich was great, veal was cooked just right and the breading was perfect.  There was more than enough tomato sauce and the bread was nice and fresh.  Definitely will come again, highly recommend.  Parking might be a bit tricky depending on the time of the day."}
{"text":"Sent me the wrong order and then argued with me that I ordered wrong. Rude customer service, slow service and average pizza. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"The pizza is the best in the city. The price is unbeatable. The sandwiches are always very good. I only wish they were open a bit later."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was in highschool! Great veal sandwhich, pepperoni slices and fries! Price can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot when I worked in the area. place is dirty and the washrooms we're in shambles never ever any toilet paper so after taking a piss I would always have to rinse off my c#ck in their sink. Steak sandwich was sub par due to it being a cheap sandwich. Make sure u ask for less sauce on ur sandwich cause they like to load on the sauce and bread gets really soggy. I would never come here again cause I don't work in the area anymore"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over 6 years now.  The slices are some of the best in the city and the chicken sandwich is a meal in itself.  

They were even kind enough to let us film in there once!

{"text":"3 word summary: cheap takeout food.

Many words summary:
Stopped in a few times and have sampled a variety of their offerings. The good side is that everything is quite cheap. $5.30 + tax for sandwiches, even less for burgers, and under $3 per slice of pizza.

Nothing is bad, but nothing is great, Everything tastes a little bland. For example, the rib sandwich is those preformed pork patties with the rib shapes, much like a McRib. The barbecue sauce is good but the sandwich felt like it could still use some more ingredients. Veal sandwich was large, but really not that great. Some stringy sections of meat and the sauce was really bland. Asked for jalapenos and there was about 3-4 tiny slices mixed into the sandwich, so I ended up adding a fair amount of hot sauce and the sandwich did taste better. Steak sandwich was the best of the bunch, no real complaints there. Spaghetti and meatballs were filling and a big portion for $7.50 but also kind of basic in just being pasta, sauce, and a few meatballs, no cheese or peppers or anything. 

I'm also not sure where the harm would be in putting a couple chairs with a table or even just bar stools. Literally you order the food and wait awkwardly just standing there. And who knows what you'd do if you actually wanted to eat the food before leaving. But, this no frills takeout joint has been around for a while so I guess complacency is working just fine for them, and I'll probably still stop in for the occasional slice or sandwich when looking for some cheap eats."}
{"text":"The pizza here used to be good but then went downhill over the years although looking at past reviews it seems as if people have been enjoying it lately. I might give it a try again someday however with more pizza options in the neighbourhood now, this is very unlikely. I have only ever tried their steak sandwich and live by it as being the best Steak sandwich place in Toronto compared to San Francisco / California Sandwiches just east of this location. I always choose to not get the onions as I find that it can get messy and make the bread very soggy quickly. With that said, this sandwich is best if you plan to eat it within 10-15 minutes of getting it but even then is pushing it. The price for their sandwiches have also gone up but is still fairly cheap for a juice filling steak sandwich. 

This place has changed over the years in terms of decor adding a new mural to their walls however if you are planning of eating soon there aren't any chairs or tables aside from a really small edge by the window and a tiny standing section. 

If you're looking for a nice steak sandwich give this place a chance and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 25 years. Never disappoints and it's become a must visit whenever I'm in town. Great and consistent pizza, streak and veal sandwiches."}
{"text":"My boy and I were doing laundry nearby Tony & Nicks so we decided to grab a slice for lunch. It was huge, doughy, cheesy, greasy and delicious! The slices are generous drippy rectangular pizza loaves that taste like mom's meets America. I confess I had to dab some of the grease off, but other than that it was actually awesome.

My major complaint is that there's all this space in Tony & Nick's but no where to sit! We wish we could have sat down to enjoy our slices. I have to deduct some marks for this. 

If you're looking for a slice that tastes like homemade give Tony & Nick's a shot! We got two pepperoni slices and two cans of soda for just under $8. Not bad!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge and the portions of meat very generous. The problem of the soggy rolls has been mentioned and I found my sausage sandwich to be similar. Interestingly it did not seem to be slathered in sauce and the only thing that rescued it was the sausage itself. The Veal sandwich on the other hand had crusty rolls BUT no sauce (or a minuscule amount at best). The Veal was tough (calf died while being chased around the barnyard?) and totally lacking in flavour. Even the Parmesan was bland.
California Sandwich can rest easy."}
{"text":"Great place for veal, steak, or chicken cutlet sandwiches which are just under $7 . I find that their sandwiches are better than san francesco and california sandwiches. Their pizza are good too!
The best part of all is their prices and quick service.
Been going here for 20 years, its a family ran business. 
If you want great grub for a great price, cant get any better than this brown bag joint."}
{"text":"Been coming here 3years amazing services and great food. A great price for steak sandwich and there pizza wow!!!!!! The only thing is they won't deliver past Dufferin and St.Clair."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. 

Their Steak Sandwich with spicy peppers -- to die for!!! The sandwich bun was hot and fresh and you can tell their meat was homemade. 

The seasonings on the meat were out of this world. Love this place!! Hope to come back and try their pizza."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich in town and also the cheapest. They deliver too and quickly! Been going to this family business my whole life. It's dufferin groves precious little secret"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE! Always this cute girl working there, LOVE their veal sandwich...its not the greatest sandwich in the world, but it is definitely the best value for money"}
{"text":"I was looking for something good to eat in the area and found this place. When I entered the shop, there were two people sitting on the \"step\" near the window eating their sandwiches. Another person was reading the local newspaper eating at the standing table. The place is definitely not a dine-in place as there are no chairs or tables. As a matter of fact, the place is quite empty. However, there's a lot of floor space if you don't mind sitting on the ground. This is more of a take-out place.  

I ordered the Veal on a bun ($5.75) and it was ABSOLUTELY delicious! There were 2 large thin pieces of fried pork slathered with lots of tomato sauce. It was just what I like! 

I will definitely try the other types of sandwiches next time. The pizza menu looks promising too! For sure a recommended place for lunch :)"}
{"text":"pretty good, i've been attending here for years.

I usually get the veal sandwich, or there rather unique delicious pizza. Over all, its pretty good for its price and keep coming back. 

But, recently, I got the lasagna. And, sorry, Nick, and Tony, but it was terrible. I carried the bag home and it was leaking tomato sauce. It was almost like soup, i actually couldnt' find the lasagna, it was like a war seen from saving private ryan.  Its a real shame. Overall, great place just don't recommend the lasagna.

AND GET SOME TABLES AND CHAIRS WILL YA?"}
{"text":"I recently moved into the area and on the day we moved in I was looking for pizza delivery that was not your standard chain. After reading the review for Tony's and Nick's Place, I decided to give them a try. I called in the delivery request and was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and efficient the lady on the phone was. For our first order I got: 

1 panzerotti
1 medium pizza
2 sandwiches (one veal and one steak)
1 salad

Delivery took about an hour - too long for me, but the food was tasty, so we let the long delivery time go. Folks were specially blown away by the panzerotti and the sandwiches. The pizza was meh - nothing special, and the salad was just a plain salad. 

To-date we have ordered twice from here, and for our second order, we stuck to the panzerotti and sandwiches. I really like the veal sandwich, but it is a shame that by the time the food is delivered to you, the bread is pretty soggy and cold. Nevertheless, it's still pretty good. 

If you are dining in, keep in mind that they have no seating."}
{"text":"I work down the street, and when I have to drag my kids with me to work, they insist on a pizza from here. I have to say the make a very nice cheese pizza! Fluffy dough, good sauce, tonnes of gooey cheese. And they don't tease me when I ask for delivery, even though I am 50 paces down the street and could easily pick it up myself :)

If I am in a rush and only have $3 to my name, I grab a massive \"slice\" (pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper). I also love their steak sandwich, order it medium or spicy, the jalapeños cut the richness of the stewed onions on it. But don't try to eat it walking down the street (or wearing white) as it is amazingly messy. 

I am not as big of a fan of their chicken or veal sandwich. I confess I go to a different Italian sandwich place for that about a kilometer east."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood take-out pizza and sandwich joint near the corner of duff and dundas. Been coming here for years love the spicy steak and veal sandwiches. Full of flavour and great portions."}
{"text":"I always drop by here to have a bite of the delicious Italian sandwiches they offer. A taste of Italy in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really dig Tony & Nick's place for having Pizza that reminds me of Windsor style. A few weeks ago my girlfriend and I split a large 4 topping pizza which came to just under 20 dollars. We live around the corner so it was close for us to walk and pick up. Like I said, closest thing to Windsor style pizza except for not as much sauce/cheese and the pepperoni isn't sliced up. That's a personal preference of course. 

Just recently had the  Sweet Veal that a few friends recommended. I'm a big fan of California sandwiches and this was very close to it. I didn't get any extra's on it (Cheese or Mushroom is the only extra toppings you can get for a dollar each). Not as much sauce as California Sandwiches puts on it, but the meat is right on par for a few dollars cheaper. Will go again!"}
