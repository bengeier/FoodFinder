{"text":"This place is terrific!  Not much on decor, but the food is really good.  Tacos, burros, tostadas, and combos.  I had a pollo asado sope and 2 shrimp tacos that were tangy and delicious. Open til 9 or 10pm."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time based on a neighborhood app recommendation.  I had three of the Grande Tacos. Lengua, Cabeza and Pastor.  Delicious and the staff was very friendly. My Spanish isn't great but was able to order easily.  Great corn tortillas and took home a package of them.  Awesome experience overall!!!!"}

{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you.  I have driven by here many times and haven't stopped.  So glad i did today.  This is a diamond in the rough.  I ordered 2 carne asada reg tacos with rice and beans.  Probably the best i have ever had.  Thier guacamole and salsas are delicious. Also very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food menu...my favorites...carne de res en Chile rojo, barbacoa, birria, tacos de pollo asado, de asada o tripa!!The food they serve is real authentic Mex food, the kind only Mexican grandmas can cook!! If I could I would give them 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant! It's impressive to see the workers making the dough for the tortillas right in front of you. There are plenty of dishes to choose from. They also have Mexican sodas in the glass bottles, which is always good in my opinion. The customer service was awesome, since I wasn't really sure what to order, the cashier helped me figure out the best option to feed a family of 9. The prices are reasonable. And the offer a dinner special to feed a family of 4. However the downside is that it is very small and crowded. There aren't a lot of tables to sit and eat. I would definitely recommend ordering to go."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here, friend brought me here for breakfast and was mind blown of the great mexican food they served here! Still have a lot of plates I need to try out, but can't wait to go back."}
