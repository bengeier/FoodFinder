{"text":"Food, atmosphere and staff excellent. Huge portions at decent prices. But lights are way too bright. LED possibly? Maybe a dimmer? Its like being at planet fitness"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Italian Restaurant/pizzeria. The owners are straight from Long Island and both are seen working very hard in the restaurant every time we are there. I've had the penne a la vodka, stuffed shells, calzones, pizza, and Gorgonzola salad and all were delicious! My husband enjoys the chicken parm hero. Prices are fair, portions are large, and staff is friendly. I hope this place is around for years to come!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!! We finally have real Italian food in Huntersville/Cornelius!  The staff is great, the portions are huge,  and the food is fantastic. We have the drunken Sicilian pizza, the lasagna and salads. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am so grateful this restaurant opened.  REAL Italian food, REAL NY pizza...it's a taste of home in NC.  The owners are from Phil's Pizza on Long Island.  All their food is authentic, home made and fresh.  They even make their own salad dressings.  Portions are huge (plan for leftovers) and prices are reasonable.    Most important, the food is delicious.  Wow, just wow.  You need to try this place!  I will be returning often."}
{"text":"Fresh Salads, excellent Eggplant Parm.   Excellent Service.  This place is great!  We can't wait to try the rest of the menu!  Support your new local restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Maolo's a few times now and it hasn't disappointed.  The food is great, the portions are huge, the waitstaff is friendly and the prices are very affordable.  This is now our go to Italian restaurant for dine-in and takeout."}
{"text":"Go here for takeout every Friday. This place is amazing. I think I had the best cheese pizza I had in years. It was awesome. We also had an eggplant rollatini pizza. Food is best Italian I have found. Chicken parmesan dinner. Giant portion. I have been there every week since they opened and it just gets better  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Their Maola's Special is simply delicious and so was their eggplant Parmesan as recommended by the House."}
{"text":"Finally NY pizza! Only tried their cheese but it was incredible!! The only thing i wasn't a huge fan of is I think they use parmesean on their chese pizza instead of just motz."}
{"text":"Finally a close place with great NY style pizza.  Can't wait to go back and try their salads and entrees."}
{"text":"First visit and loved it.  The garlic bread was perfect. The bolognese is too die for.  Rich and meaty and absolutely divine.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Thought we'd give it a try again, but I had a similar problem that I had 6 mos. ago. My wife had finished eating (she got her food this time), and they asked if she wanted the rest of her food boxed, but I hadn't even received my meal yet, after an hour of waiting. The food is really good, but I'm not returning again."}
{"text":"This place is incredible and family owned! The food is real Italian cuisine in a casual atmosphere.  You absolutely can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We've been to Maola's many a times, both for take out and dining in. It's a relatively new restaurant in the area, but there really aren't that many good pizza places in the area, so we gave Maola's a shot and haven't looked back.   The wait staff is always friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Whether the food is take out or dine in, its consistently delicious. The calzones are good, the pasta is good and so are the portion sizes.   I've had the buffalo chicken pizza and I kind of made my own \"brooklyn white\" with Italian sausage, spinach, and ricotta. Both of these pizzas were delicious.   I know Maola's recently changed ownership, so hopefully the new owners can keep up the high standard of service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Never disappoints!! Dodd and service are amazing - haven't found anything on the menu I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"I love supporting small local business but I felt compelled to write a review, not based on service but more a food quality situation. Im no going to take anything away from them minus quality of food, because all the people in there worked hard, and the service is very friendly but the food could be better. My chicken parmesan was rubbery and the sauce tasted as though they mixed food lion tomato paste with water, although The bread was great,. My girlfriend had the lasagna and agreed the best part was the bread, which they give you an abundance of.... 3 stars due to family oriented and hard working, but I will make the trip to Rocky's pizza in Huntersville when my hankering for Italian arises, Usually twice a week and they never disappoint... The fact I live directly behind the restaurant and having a 15 yes old daughter who loves pizza, which we have not had btw. But I will give them another opportunity. You can't satisfy everyone but I feel there are far better options when considering Italian feastivities. \"Rocky's!\""}
{"text":"Omg, Y'all! Deliciousness in every bite! The sauces are perfection! The portions are huge. Everything is fresh! The prices are so modest for the high quality. Great place!"}
{"text":"Love the Food! If you want quality and TLC! Go there! I work at a restaurant down the road. I shouldn't tell people about them but, I do. I'm also from up North so this place is the closest to my heart because it tastes like home! REAL Itialiano. The portions are great! Oh, and cannolis and Tiramisu!! Just like home! And soo big!  Thank You,  For giving my tastebuds home cooked meals!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The meatball parmesan sandwich is the best I've tasted. The ham calzones are good and my daughter loves the chicken rolls. The owner is a great guy. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Its good, but not great....yet.  It's BRAND new, and we've had two different experiences so far. (To be expected with the newness). First time, we had 2 slices in the restaurant, and the dough/crust definitely could of been cooked longer. It was more chewy than crunchy, and didn't have that typical brown colored crust (due to undercooked). Also, it was strange they didn't have Parmesan cheese or red pepper flakes at each table.    It was still great, just needed to be baked a little longer. Also- per slice, it's only $2.50! That's a great deal!   We ordered take out yesterday (18in cheese and fries). Pizza was MUCH better this go around. Baked perfectly!  I would suggest some type of extra seasoning.  Whether it be garlic, or something.  It's missing a little \"umph\".    The fries are a total miss.  I love that they are HUGE steak fries, however with the tin they come in, by the time I got home (5 minutes away) there was so much condensation created, they were all soggy and mushy.  Gross.  That needs to change for sure.   Side notes: hope they implement a menu above the register.  It's a HUGE open empty and under utilized space. I'd assume they will, just with it being so new, might not be in the plans yet.    Also, being closed on Mondays is a huge miss. With Harris Teeter having pizza deals on Monday nights, it's an opportunity to pull from those customers with some kind of promotion. Especially with being across the street.   Also with the Disc Golf Glow League on Monday nights (at Bailey park) a lot of players get pizza after.  Another miss.    However, I'm definitely glad to have some \"NY style\" pizza down in the south, that is actually good."}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered two pizzas fries and a salad. Pizza was cooked perfect and tasted great. The fries were a bit soggy because of the packaging but still good to eat. If we ever come back to Lake Norman we'll order again."}
{"text":"Thank you for finally bringing pizza to Cornelius that tastes like home. Our family hails from Northern NJ and Long Island... And you Maolas Pizza are now our go-to."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars on first visit but made an exception this time  This is one of those cases where it's going to be interesting to see if it survives. I hope it does. Previously there was a Bellacino;s in this spot for a number of years and then a short lived stay with Village Inn Pizza.  Took forever to open but Cornelius is notorious for the number of inspections required to open a place so I could understand the delay.  Finally opened and after a couple of weeks to settle down, my wife went here for lunch one Saturday.  Several architectural and design changes from the previous restaurants have lead to a very attractive and open restaurant that is very pleasant and relaxing.  You walk and you are immediately seated. Very Comfortable Environment.  Good wait staff service.  My wife ordered the Chicken Francese  (she would have preferred veal but the don't offer veal) with a side of Linguine with Red Sauce.  I had the Lasagna.  While we were waiting, we were severed an excellent hot bread with both EVOO and  Balsamic to create out own dipping sauce.  Good Start.  Our main courses are served and they are huge.. More than a normal person could eat in a normal meal,  My wife enjoyed her Chicken and is definitely a fan.  As for myself, my Lasagna was good but oddly enough, there was so much I had it again on Monday and Tuesday.  Each day it got better as the flavors had a chance to meld.  Going to be a good addition to the Cornelius Dining Scene but a bit hard to find in the small shopping center to the right of Food Lion in downtown Cornelius"}
{"text":"Just picked up chicken and eggplant Parmesan. Stop searching for any other Italian. This is the best Italian food in the Lake Norman area. Food is unbelievable. In fact, it's so good that my fianc√© made me stop eating to write this review."}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened and I think there were some issues.  Tonight had salads, a sub and an eggplant rolatini pizza. Food was excellent.  Service was wonderful.  They have definitely improved all aspects on the service side. A great local place. Will definitely be back !  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see a few negative reviews here but I suppose even the best establishments have an off night from time to time.  From my perspective, Maola's is a hit!  I've had the pizza, the pasta and even a meatball sandwich.  All of them were delicious and fed me for at least 1 more meal at home.  We have found the wait staff to be engaging and friendly on each of our 6 visits to Maola's.    The only minor downside is the stark lighting in the dining area.  I'm not one to take notice of such things normally but for some reason this caught my attention here.  Install a dimmer switch and you are approaching perfection.  We are glad you guys are here and look forward to many more meals at Maola's."}
{"text":"Stopped in and chatted about work but got to know Louie and Dawn the owners in a short time. Long Island blood line and now locals to the area. They care about the community and their product. Everything is fresh house made, locally sourced products along with imported items. Made to order food and classically prepped. A lot of love and passion in their product so go see them and tell them I sent you."}
{"text":"One of the few places offering shrimp parmigiana in our immediate area. Caesar Salad was excellent, cold and plenty of dressing.  Bread, oil and vinegar provided was hot and tasty. Friendly, efficient service with generous potions at good prices.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Portions are large,  food was delicious.  Had a group of 9 and everyone commented how well they liked their food.  I had the chicken marsala. The chicken was hot and tender.  The sauce was so good I had to soak up every last bit with the bread served.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When your Yelp reviews are good and I walk into an empty restaurant, someone is lying! In this case the Yelp reviews were false! This place is horrendous!   Our server was a lot on the slow side and not just physically slow. The bread was cold and the butter was frozen! A clear sign of a bad restaurant. But still we decided to stay and give it a try.   She ordered spaghetti and meatballs in a garlic and oil sauce and what arrived was the most pathetic excuse for pasta I've ever seen. I will post pictures so you can see how incompetent the people cooking in this place are. Picture a soup with meatballs floating on top! It was DROWNING in oil!    My Chicken Frances was no better as they clearly use low quality frozen chicken. We ended up paying over 30$ for disgusting pasta. I would never recommend this place to anyone!   THEY'RE HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time getting a couple pies to go. The 18New York style was great, nice chewy crust with just the right ratio of chew and crunch on the edges. Plenty of fresh cheese and toppings. We also ordered a Grandma's described as a thin crust on the menu. It's actually a \"thinner sicilian style. It was good but not thin. I'll be back to try the Italian menu as I am always searching for good Italian in this area with few choices. The place was packed, the staff extremely friendly.   Second visit I dined in. Tried the chicken francese which had just the right amount of white wine to lemon ratio. Two large chicken cutlets with just the right amount breading were laid over penne pasta which the waitress asked if I wanted in red sauce or the same wine/lemon sauce. Good attention to detail as I preferred the wine sauce.   I love this place it's like mama's Italian kitchen with all the family."}
{"text":"We just visited and ordered a couple pizzas to go.  We had eggplant rolatini while we waited.  The eggplant was delicious and nice portion.  Pizzas are excellent!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"WOW.  I'm 100% italian and I have to tell you this is the real deal.  Nothing fancy but GREAT food.  Had the pasta Fagioli - huge portion and YUM!  It was kind of buttery and home-made.  Then had the linguini with meat sauce and meatballs.  Very tasty.  The meatballs were an 8 out of 10.  Again, great portions.  My wife had Chicken Francese...AMAZING.  These people know how to cook chicken...it melted in your mouth!  My friends had the pasta carbonara and LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  Had leftovers and it got better each day (had 3 meals). Service was very good and the bread/ EVOO/balsamic was fresh and delicious.  On a separate occasion,   we ordered pizza take out.  Again, I was FLOORED.  Home Made sausage, huge pieces of beautiful green pepper and nice sliced onion...so fresh and delicious....crust was VERY GOOD.  My only fear is that too many people find out about it and I wont be able to get a seat lol.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Got an alert about a new Italian restaurant and read the reviews.   Based on those I had to try it.   I was not disappointed.    Wife and I tried this on a Friday evening and we really enjoyed.   We couldn't decide on what we wanted so we tried a few dishes (pizza, eggplant rolitini with a salad.     Service was really good.   Once we were seated we were treated right away.  She provided some good recommendations and felt that she had a good understanding of what was good.   Attentive throughout the entire meal without being overbearing.    Food.  Like I said, we tried a number of things. We had the Maola's Special pizza and the eggplant rolitini.   Both were very generous portions and really good quality.  I really liked the roasted peppers on the pizza.    Really enjoyed our experience and look forward to returning.  They have so many things on the menu that I want to try.      Nice Job!!!"}
{"text":"A very nice addition to the restaurant offering in the Lake Norman area. Selection is good, portions are huge.  Having their liquor license is a plus.   Service was excellent and everyone with me had favorable things to say about the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Maola's. The only negative was, to much food for lunch, if that can be considered a negative. Service was awesome and the food was even better. Since I often eat lunch in town, I would love to see a lunch menu with daily specials. But, with that said this restaurant was very much needed and I believe will become a very popular eatery in Cornelius."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had in this area!!!  For $20 you get a huge  pizza.  So large I could only eat one slice! Seriously can feed 4-6 people easily. Staff is friendly and we can't wait to try other dishes.  We are food snobs so we do not eat out much but this place passed our test."}
{"text":"So happy to have them near me! Lovely little italian restaurant. Had garlic olive oil pasta with chicken...it was beyond delicious! Finally i could get a pasta with no cheese n tomato in it. Portion size for lunch was huge but you do need some more for next day cravings"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it fine dining, but it's very good, and there's plenty of it. The eggplant rollatini is done very well, stuffed with a nice ricotta. The speciaty pizzas are all tasty. I recommend the buffalo chicken or the vodka sauce chicken. Any of the calzones are really big and stuffed with nice mozzarella and ricotta. I asked them to add spinach to mine, and it was fantastic. Great job Maola's!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time based on fellow Yelp reviewers. We have needed a solid Italian restaurant with good value for the money like a Portofinos that I love  in Charlotte.  While It is not quite as good as Portofinos, this place is a great value for the money. I ordered eggplant rollatini and my husband got the lasagne. Both were very good tasting and good size portions. Highly recommended for a solid, good value Italian in the Lake Norman. I will be back soon to try the pizza which also looked great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found it a real pleasure going to Maola's. The food was excellent with very large portions. The servers were all very kind and professional and the service was great. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I think this place isn't for me.  There are so many great reviews, my wife included, so this must just be me.  I've been twice and, in my opinion, everything was just okay.  The facility is small and set up a little weird but I think they will eventually outgrow this place and move into a spot that will better suit how busy they are are.  The service was a little slow but this place but bumping each time that I went.  The first time I went, I ordered the Drunken Sicilian: thick crust with mozzarella, vodka sauce and basil.  In my opinion, it just wasn't very flavorful... the crust nor the sauce.  Don't get me wrong, it was a decent pizza but just wasn't for me.  The second time that I went, I got the cheese ravioli in tomato sauce.  I pretty much has the same experience.  Now... my experiences from a flavor standpoint haven't been out of the park but the service has always been okay and the place is kept up well.  AND... I have heard that their stuffed shells and their calzones are bomb though."}
{"text":"There is no pizza in the area that can even compare.   In fact, everything on their menu is a winner.   Every restaurant in this area should come here and take some notes, seriously.  There's a very simple philosophy, it's called consistency.  They've nailed that.  There's another little thing, and this ones called love.  When you put that love in your food, it shows.  And they undoubtedly have that down pat.   Let's face the facts, Cornelius and Davidson have a slew of absolutely horrible eatery's.  So if you're tired of wasting your hard earned dollar on a big fat disappointment, eat at Maola's.   Simple as that."}
{"text":"Maola's has excellent Italian! If you are looking for a sandwich, their chicken parmesan sub is awesome. It is large enough for two and love how it is toasted. Also want to give a shout out for their excellent take out service, take out is simple and always packaged well."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness Some people in our neighborhood have been posting on Facebook about this new italian/pizza place and how yummy it was... and they weren't kidding! Yes this place is veryyyy good and yes I can tell they've done this before (fellow long islander)! Tonight we ordered the grandma pie... which is second to none in the area!! We also ordered the carbonara sauce with linguine. Not only was the pasta dish enough to easily feed 4 people but the flavor is insanely good!!Move over Mama's!!  Anyway- try it out and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Two stops.   The first stop was for pizza. Good but not amazing.   Second trip was for Italian food. We waited 35 minutes for the food, but there is usually a good reason for the delay. Plus, this left more time to fill up on bread (always a plus).   My biggest disappointment, and the reason for a 4 instead of a 5, is that they wouldn't honor a request for a kid's-size Chicken Parmesan. This felt greedy.   The Chicken Parmesan was solid. The flavor didn't pop, but still better than any other in the area. Huge portion too. The Stuffed Shells were excellent, as was the salad. The Penne was good but lukewarm under hot pasta.  Overall, I recommend."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had the last 10 years living in NC. Great place to take the family and enjoy going out to eat. I can't wait to go back and get more"}
{"text":"We stopped in becasue so many have given this a great review. So glad we did. We enjoyed the meal very much. I had eggplant and spaghetti and the bread was super fresh. Not as good as Mama's in Huntersville but its close and well priced. I will be back."}
{"text":"Well we tried it and I'm not terribly impressed. Chicken parm is thin slices of chicken piled on top of each other, it is just way too much breading and way way too much cheese. The three stars are for the sauce, it has good flavor but very oily. I could barley tell I was eating chicken tho through all the breading and cheese. The lasagna as well is just a big slop of cheese. The portions are huge but I would prefer quality over quantity. The quality seems to be lacking. Not too much meat or layers in the lasagna. No garlic bread either which was disappointing. Chicken seems like it may come pre made and frozen, dry and reminds me of the texture of a chicken nugget. May try the pizza but not sure if I'll be back. I think Antico in huntersville is way better quality for around the same price."}
{"text":"Going a full-on 5 Stars after one visit for take out and doing so with zero reservations. Maola's is a dynamite addition to the LKN food scene.   What they offer is great NY style Italian with pizza and pasta taking center stage on a menu that also includes salads, hot heros, calzones/rolls and a variety of classic entrees.   I can't comment too much on the pizza since we ordered one with extra pepperoni and no sauce to accommodate a picky son but with some side marinara dumped on, it tasted great and had a good thin, chewy crust.   We tried three other dishes. Rigatoni with bolognese, spaghetti with meatballs and lasagna. Check, check and check!  Huge portions (We're now eating leftovers for lunch) for a good price and really tasty.  Re. the pasta offerings, check this out... Choose from four different types of pasta and then pick from THIRTEEN different sauces!  Word seems to be out as every table was full when I walked in around 7:00 on a Sunday. Maola's is not as delicate and refined in their offerings like a Caruso's in Mooresville but they aren't trying to be either. They are doing quality, stick to the ribs Italian and doing it very well."}
