{"text":"I'm not often impressed with fancy schmancy restaurants.  In fact the more popular and cool it is, the food leaves much to be desired.  I find in the age of \"celebrity chefs\" the focus is on style and not substance.  Susur is a celebrity chef, yes, but the man knows his food..and hire chefs who share his passion.  Madeline's does not disappoint.  At first glance, some dishes on the menu sounds simple.  Welsh rarebit you ask? Bah, open faced grilled cheese!  What you come to realize its the best open faced cheese toast you've had.  The bread is perfectly toasted - crisp on the edges yet still soft in the center.  The cheese sauce is flavorful, not overpowering and perfectly browned.    It's the attention to detail and quality ingredients that I appreciate.  It's the reason that I will go there again and again, as my budget allows.  I can go on and on.  But I won't.  I haven't eaten dinner yet and I'm hungry.  Treat yourself and check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good and service (which I am a stickler for) was outstanding. The corn was phenomenal and the main dishes which we ordered (which included the lamb chop) were awesome. Overall a very good experience and a good way to end our visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Hubby and his cousins and I stumbled upon Madeline's on a warm summer Monday night, when we discovered that our previously determined dinner spot was closed for renovations.   What an awesome turn of events...  One of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever visited.  Walking off of Kings Street and into Madeline's is the closest to stepping into a fairy tale I have ever experienced.   The decor makes me think of a whimsical and sexy place where one would run into Jessica Rabbit.  Extraordinarily talented restaurant staff who put love and creativity into every dish.  A wine list that while not overly extensive, offers something for all tastes.    The hostess, waiter etc. were the epitome of professional.  Our group  took our time, enjoyed each course, shared food and truly reveled in our accidental 5 star evening.   I will for sure make a special trip again the next time we are in Toronto and I suggest that anyone who loves creative food, incredible service and a notable atmosphere visit Madeline's.  Notable vegetarian options: spinach ricotta gnocchi garlic chips dessert, blueberry tart in a flaky pocket with homemade cream atop unfortunately, I see the other items we tried must have been seasonal as not listed online"}
{"text":"Since Susur has left us for the brighter lights of the much bigger NYC, questions abound.  Is this possibly the worst timing misstep by such a luminary? Will the newly bankrupted and modestly less well heeled New Yorker's cozy up to his sophisticated cuisine given that all of their investment funds have dried up?  In his wake, aside from the cool \"Lee\", Susur has left us with Madeline's.  Having gone under a total revamp of menu and decor, Madeline's presents itself with a darker  gothically glamourous room.  With it, comes a less complicated - more approachable menu still sprinkled with a hint of complexity for which he was famous.  Head chef Jason Carter does an admirable job of maintaining the quality of the previous restaurant.   The dishes are delivered in an informal style - more like family feast where we all get to share bits of various dishes or have to them yourself.  I liked this style of communal dining.  One of my friends was mildly disappointed with his serving of halibut but by and large we all had something different and all had good things to say about their respective dishes.  I must admit that i found my French-Chinese duck breast delicious but a tad on the salty side as my thirst afterwards attested.   I'll definitely revisit Madeline's.   Service was great, on point and friendly.  The room was devoid of the snootiness one has come to associate with this type of establishment (granted, we were a group in an otherwise pretty empty room on a Monday evening).  But none of us left unsatisfied - even those of us unaccustomed to spending money on pricier restaurants.   If you have a choice between going to one of those mega-resto chains ala Milestones or spending the same amount at a place like Madeline's - no need to think.  You will get a far superior meal here.  As the 4 **** indicates: \"Yay! I'm a fan!\""}
{"text":"One Liner: Best Pork Belly I Ever Had  Food: (scale of 0-4) 3 Ok, I guess I don't usually have pork bellies. This was one special occasion. Ok, maybe it wasn't a special occasion. I was just curious. This pork belly dish turned out to be pretty special. It was yummy. I can't begin to think how many calories were in that piece of .... fat. But that was an unique experience. If you have cholesterol and calories quota, I would highly recommend it.   Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.6  Service 0.2: This little girl recommended the pork belly. That's gotta deserve full credit.   Decor 0.2:   Speed 0.1:   Dessert 0.1: I had some black rice dessert. It was pretty good  Prices 0: It ain't cheap is all I have to say.  My score for this experience is 3.6 stars."}
{"text":"Madeline's is what Lee Restaurant could be if it wasn't so muddled in mediocrity. Chef Susur Lee creates a refined French Bistro Infusion style to Madeline's that is sure to impress your out-of-town guests.  It's a twist on traditional French faire that is really fun to experience with a party of three or more. Because there are so many interesting variations, you want to experience it with a number of epicureans at once. The portions are perfectly sized and the staff really know their stuff. The wine list is excellent, with a bin-end offered for some great deals.  Given the choice between Lee Restaurant and Madeline's, the latter shall always prevail."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good, except for a couple of dishes that seemed to lack flavor and panache like the others. Do not try the fried tomato! The decor is phenomenal and pretty over the top, but I really love it! Though it is a bit pricey for what you get, I was pretty disappointed in the service! I had to send one item back for serious lack of description on the menu: \"Chicken with garlic and a gorgonzola sauce, BONELESS.\" Perfect, so I'm excepting a piece of chicken, boneless. That's not what you get, and apparently there is a preparation that involves \"trying to remove\" the bones from the inside and serving it boneless. Well, it failed, there were bones. I just didn't get it. When sending this back, the server was incredibly argumentative! After speaking with Greg, the manager, who is not present on the floor and must called, he didn't seem interested much. In fact, while speaking with Greg, said server comes back and argues AGAIN with my partner at the table. After dessert and assuming the bill was slightly adjusted, I spoke with Greg again. He had yet again a haute and non-interested attitude, which at this point I could care less. He then attempted to tell me there was no way he could adjust the bill accordingly.  Haha, then why have a general manager? He wasn't on the floor, had to be called, and now is unable to make adjustments on the bill. I'd say, \"you're fired\" and save the big paycheck for a waitstaff that's superior to other restaurants in the area. Added note: the bartender was the best thing going for this place. He was incredibly polite and very personable."}
{"text":"I went to Madeline's with pretty high expectations and very excited to dine here on my first trip ever to Toronto.  so it was with great disappointment for me to find out later that Susur Lee was not in the kitchen anymore.  This may have explained a lot as my dining experience was far less than expected.  As we entered the restaurant I was impressed with the Byzantine decor - very funky and eclectic while being well thought out.  I loved the color changing walls and the Rooster mannequins. Although,  I am still a little perplexed by the 70's funk music that played loudly throughout the restaurant and I'm still unsure if it was a pleasing touch or an unusual annoyance so I will just mention it at that.  Our party requested a special menu so we had about 14 different dishes at our table.  While not a single dish was memorable some of my colleagues had fun with one or two components from each dish.    I started with a Hot and Sour soup which was dense, very dark and lacked dimension.  I initially thought I was sipping on gravy but a careful observation helped me to find some components of a classic hot and sour.    My next course was jerk chicken with mango sauce and scotch bonnet sauce.  The dish was unusual in that I expected some pretty big and bold flavors but there was nothing there that really delivered.  The dish was really sweet and had almost no hint of jerk seasoning.  The flavors were really not working for me up  to this point and I needed  to change my pre arranged menu as I saw this dining experience going straight off the road real fast.  when I asked the waiter if I could switch my menu because I was not happy so far he graciously obliged and explained that my food was coming from the restaurant next door.  WTF?  Yes, the restaurant next door.  I later found out that the restaurant next door is a Suser Lee concept but it was a little more casual and less expensive than Madeline's.  here is where things are really starting to sour with my party but we trudged on...  I think each one in our party began to give up as each new course arrived but I really tried to keep an open mind - after  waiting for almost 20 minutes for our next course I didn't feel good about what was yet to come.  At one point our waiter assured me that he would not forget or mix up a special request because he would be the only one taking care of our table - not a good sign. Having said that, From this point in my review I think it would be best to summarize - so for the sake of being brief here goes:  * My Scallop were very overcooked while others in my party had undercooked scallops. This odd pairing included Chorizo and what may have been some sort of pesto.  Flavors were too heavy but fortunately those heavy flavors managed to mask my overcooked bitter scallop. * Chicken dish was nice but portions were a bit big for a 7 course tasting menu - This dish alone could have been a star, unfortunately I had to get it off of someone else's plate  * gnocchi was dense and a bit heavy.  Again a large portion.  The flavors were outstanding on this dish but it was an odd combination for a gnocchi dish.  I ended up pushing my gnocchi to the side and finishing the highlight of my meal - a spinach and bean mixture with a generous smack of lemon and the most beautiful pine nuts I've ever eaten.  I think the dish had ricotta as well. * Halibut dish was uneventful and begging for seasoning.  It was nicely prepared but fell flat on uniqueness and could have easily been saved with salt * Beet salad should have been called Salad Frisee with a few beets and pile of  weird gherkin mayonnaise sauce and spicy hot pecans.  I loved the beets alone but this dish was a train wreck.   * Desserts - a pumpkin panna cotta had great flavor but it was dense with too much gelatin while another guava-pineapple panna cotta had a great intense flavor with balance and craveability.  Chocolate desserts were good but the sorbet and ice cream pile was hit and miss.  One of the sorbets was sooo tart that we  passed it around the table just so everyone could taste how unbelievably bad it was.  Overall I had a good meal with OK service but for a 100 dollars per person I expect a great meal and great service.  There are some serious technical flaws that a diner should never expect with this price tag and a chef should never experiment on his customers.   I felt that I was being experimented on.  Don't go to Madeline's expecting a 4 star experience (which I did).  It is no where near that.  since I do not know what the dining scene is in Toronto I can't compare the place to any others but I can't imagine  another place at 100 dollars per person that wouldn't be leap years ahead of this place."}
{"text":"A little bit of background: yes, this is still Susur Lee's restaurant. Although he's moved to New York to concentrate on his new restaurant Shang (http://www.yelp.com/biz/shang-new-york-2), Madeline's is still affiliated with Susur Lee (it's named after his mom!). From what I was told by our incredibly polite & knowledgeable server Scott, the restaurant rebranded/reopened about a year ago under the name Madeline's with a new menu and fresh look.  The decor used to be a stark white, but it's now dark and brooding, with lots of purples and blacks and backlit wall screens. There is heaps of velvet, too, and my plush chair was among the more comfortable seats I've sat in. It was roomy enough for two people to sit on, which was handy since we were a large group and there was a lot of mingling. The noise level in Madeline's is not unlike Sneaky Dee's (yes, strange comparison, I know) - you absolutely can't hear what the person next to you is saying. You have to strain your voice so drink some Throat Coat before your visit or you'll be hoarse by night's end.  There were fifteen of us and most people ordered the tasting menu ($60), but I didn't see much on it for my palate (I'm vegetarian) so I ordered a la carte: \"butter roasted sweet potato with maple syrup, garlic and rosemary\" ($9) and \"hand rolled spinach ricotta gnocchi with garlic, chili, basil, pine nuts, portobello mushrooms, lemon juice, aged reggiano & olive oil\" ($18). The sweet potato side was incredible and the portion was surprisingly large (enough for 2-3 people to share!). The sweet potatoes were melt-in-your-mouth velvety and perfectly seasoned.   The gnocchi was otherworldly. The flavour combination rendered me absolutely speechless. It was more than your usual \"gnocchi swimming in tomato sauce\" - it was a substantial meal with lots of garnishes and contents to it. Pine nuts! Lemon! Spinach! SO GOOD!  When the server brings out your food, they present it to you like you're some sort of tsar - they point to it and run down the endless list of ingredients and components in case you forgot what you ordered or were so in awe of the presentation that you couldn't tell what you were looking at.   The prices are absurdly out of my usual range but you know what you're getting into when you make a reservation, and I have nothing but praise for the food. Watch out for drinks because it can quickly get expensive. Make sure you ask for a drink menu so you know how much you're spending because they have wine bottles priced up to $2000 (my friend thought the YEAR was 2000, but alas, it was the price).  A few times throughout the evening we saw a familiar character, chef Susur Lee himself lurking around the dining room and inspecting people's plates, making his presence known. Scott informed us that he randomly comes back to Toronto to work at Madeline's and that people call all the time asking if tonight will be the night that he's there, but that they never know in advance. It's just random.  The only thing that disappointed me was what I will refer to as the Great Cake Debacle Of 2009. My friend baked and brought a cake for the birthday and Madeline's charged us a $5 PER PERSON plating fee. I can understand charging $20 or something for cutlery and plates, but almost everyone had ordered the tasting menu, which includes dessert anyway, which we weren't going to eat. So that would cancel out the complaint about having to sully plates and cutlery. $5 per person at 15 people is $75. A bit absurd.   Had it been my birthday I would have gone across the street to Second Cup and busted out the paper plates and plastic cutlery and jammed on the cake right then and there!"}
