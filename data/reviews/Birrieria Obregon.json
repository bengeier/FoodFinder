{"text":"Go mentally prepared that you will have to wait for a table, super crowded and busy but fast service when they bring your food. The good is worth the wait. Yummy in my tummy! The only thing I would change is from having white corn tortillas to yellow corn tortillas!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican Food...tacos are always on point. My husband always orders the seafood."}
{"text":"The only thing you need to know from a recent health inspection report:  Birrieria Obregon, Phoenix  \"Employee was observed draining cooked shrimp liquid into the floor drain, dropping some shrimp on the ground, picking up the shrimp and placing it back into the basket with other cooked shrimp.\""}
{"text":"Best goat birria I've ever tried! The shrimp cocktail is really good too, fresh seafood."}
{"text":"The Birria de res is Arizona's best. Come here for authentic Mexican food. It is clean and the staff is friendly. The new building is very nice and accommodates large parties."}
{"text":"Wow!  Seriously good Biria Soup.  It came with a good helping of tortillas.  I want to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I went to phoenix to visit friends and they highly recommended this restaurant for authentic mexican food. We went there for lunch, I took a look at what other people were eating as we were getting our table and it looked interesting. I had the fish tacos baja style and they were very good. We also had the sarandeado fish fillet and it was delicious.I also liked the cebada drink. the service was very good, staff was friendly even though they were fairly busy. too bad I was in phoenix for just a couple of days."}
{"text":"Me.gusta la comida lo malo que no hay control para sentarse y yo cometi el error de invitar a dos parejas mas y avia mesas grandes con solo dos personas y nosostros que eramos 6 no podiamos sentarnos"}
{"text":"Love it! They have a variety of food ranging from tacos and quesadillas to hamburgers and desserts. The portion of food you get is more than enough . I had the carne Asada quesadilla and that came with beans, rice , and toppings for the quesadilla. It was so good! Make sure you get there early because it gets pretty busy during rush hour."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazingly good. It is very authentic and fresh. In my opinion the place needs more space because it is always insanely packed. I've gone to the restaurant many times but have had to change my order to take out because there are no tables to sit at."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious!! The only downside is the wait... but it's definitely worth the wait. I usually have the beef Birria or their breakfast. You can't go wrong with whatever you choose on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent birria de chivo, great flavor and little fat. They've expanded to a larger and very clean space next door. Excellent, fast and friendly service, and everything is inexpensive. A very large and diverse menu, including breakfast, seafood, tortas, and desserts."}
{"text":"The food was great! The costumer service is horrible, the waitress was rude and took forever to take our order considering it was slow and an hour and a half near closing time was already putting away the table sauces which made us feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed to eat once we received our food. They forgot part of my order and I had to ask for it twice before anyone brought the rest of my food out!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for very authentic flavors when it comes to Mexican food, because, well... we could make it at home, you know? But sometimes we just want to be waited on, and not go through all the cooking, and the washing of dishes and pots. So when we have a really big craving for something Mexican, it is very specific, like Menudo, or Birria. Something that we know takes some time to cook, and we just want to have some right now! Well, this place was packed!! The rainy Saturday morning we ventured out to try it for the first time. Because all the empty spaces were taken by diners and people waiting for their turn, we had to wait like 15-20 minutes outside in our car. Which built some high expectations, we thought \"This gotta be super delicious\"! Well, once we got to be seated, we ordered our birrias, our kids had pancakes and Tacos de Birria, I know, don't even ask! Service was great! The ladies that took care of us, really took care of us! They were very friendly, and helpful. We thought the the birria was \"OK\", but not mind-blowing. We added all the \"Add-ins\" and it still tasted somewhat bland.  But it is a really good place to go eat, by all means... We just haven't found a place that we can recommend a 100%. No, not this one."}
{"text":"Thank goodness they moved next door to a larger location because the old location was tiny! This is a great place to go for traditional Mexican food. The Birria stew is delicious, you can tell it's been cooking all day. I love their tacos, burritos, tortas. Go early, it gets packed on the weekends. They also have a wide variety of Mexican sodas and drinks like horchata and jamaica. They mainly speak Spanish, but you can work through the languished barrier."}
{"text":"The food is good. Service is ok. The tacos de carne asada and the birria is a must try. Also the tortas de carne asada have a very unique taste. They are very good."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place only has 4 starts. It's a legit Mexican restaurant and you're getting some good birria. I always come here and never thought about yelping them. They are all nice people and have good food. My friend and I meet up here for breakfast at least once a week. Make sure to get the beef birria if you're too iffy about the goat one. They're both awesome! Fresh tortillas by the way!"}
{"text":"After My court, I was hungry so I looked for a Mexican restaurant near by and I found this one with a 5 star rating so I had to try it, and I wasn't expecting less, food was awsome and in a good portion."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a true authentic birria this is the place. The birria de chivo  (goat) was delicious. Made me think of our family Mexican vacations."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this location! The food is delicious, customer service is great and it's very clean. The food is warm and tastes very fresh, their lemonade is perfect. Definitely a go to when searching for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Excellent menudo, place was packed. If your looking for amazing menudo, or any authentic Mexican food this is the place to come. One great thing besides having a amazing fiancée is having one with a mother who makes some amazing Mexican food. My mother in law loves their coffee as well. Gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"Birria de chivo was delicious. I'll be going back with the family as they have huge menu"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place really, they are ALWAYS so freaking busy, but because they are so freaking good! So what I was thinking...call in the order and bring it home  They have the BEST Mexican Food.  I recommend their Cahuamanta / Birria or Cabesa.  This is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic. Had tacos de chicarron, cabeza and consome \"bichy\".. Delicious. Good customer service."}
{"text":"It's really good! The only thing is the double tortilla on my tacos. Other than that it's delicious."}
{"text":"Very good food. My wife is from Obregon so this is close to home for her. The prices are not bad and you can either sit inside or outside on a huge covered patio. One star less becase I wish they would stay open till later"}
{"text":"My favorite sunday place! The birreria is amazing. Usually I get it in Tacos. I recommend if coming getting here anytime between 8-9am it starts getting really busy after words and could possibly be a long wait. Either way, wait or no wait it's totally worth it. Its a small place inside and located in south Phoenix. Parking is a hassle but you will always find a way. Will always recommend this place if looking for good authentic mexican food"}
{"text":"My rating is based on service, the food is great. But: They don't prioritize on to-go orders, I don't think it's acceptable to wait more than 20 minutes for a food that's already made, even when they're busy, 10 minutes would be the max. Today, after those 20 minutes+, they called my name then they disappeared, no one came to the front to hand me the order, then they complained that they had called my name. They need to be more attentive, there were a few people around not doing much.   La calificación que les doy es en base al servicio, la comida es muy buena. Pero: No le dan prioridad a las órdenes para llevar, no encuentro aceptable esperar más de 20 minutos una comida que se supone ya está preparada, aún en horas pico, 10 minutos máximo. Hoy, después de 20 minutos, me llaman y desaparecen, nadie vino a cerciorarse y darme mi orden, y después se quejaron de haberme llamado. Necesitan poner más atención, había unas cuentas personas que parecían no estar haciendo mucho."}
{"text":"I hope we're talking about the same place, but I found their food truck near 17 and sat under the tents right before lunch.  Had chicharron tacos, buche tacos and cahuamanta tacos.  Still debating if buche is stomach or udder (as the server explained it).  All three were really good - the chicharron being the best as you can imagine.  And at a 1.50 each - even better."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, pretty delicious. Tacos are overpriced but well worth it. Service is great!"}
{"text":"Always super busy. The breakfast burritos are the only thing I go for. The service is blah, and it feels as though the wait staff could care less about customers. I don't go there by choice and don't recommend the place either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place while we were waiting for my car to get fixed. They had a pretty good deal going on, eggs, hash browns, toast and sausage or bacon for $2.99. The food was ok. I'm guessing I ordered outside of their specialties. Nothing to grand but I did love their pancakes."}
{"text":"Birria de chivo was good! The fish Baja tacos were on point. The service is alright. I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Best Shrimp Tacos!!! They're so Delicious always one of my favorite Spots! They're pancakes for breakfast are Delicious as well. I don't mind waiting since I know it is always well worth it. Also great Service"}
{"text":"I try to make it a habit to stop here every time I'm in Phoenix and it never disappoints. I've had the Birria, the Tacos and Menudo, quality of food with awesome taste. I will definitely be coming back every time I get a chance."}
{"text":"Greatest food!! It is the Mexican equivalent of Portillio's, amazing experience authentic really enjoyed my visit!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a red menudo, omg was it delicious!! I love their birria but i was in the mood for some menudo. And its definitely a must try! The ladies here are super friendly. It kinda sucks its always packed but hey thats how u know its a great place with good food ! The place they got now is bigger tho so i give them that for having more space. I love it."}
{"text":"Mi novia y yo encontramos un cucaracha en el jugo de naranja ya casi al terminar, fue muy desagradable y asqueroso. La señorita que nos atendio fue muy amable y se disculpo pero aun asi nos sentimos asqueados el saber que tomamos algo con una cucaracha adentro.  Espero y puedan solucionar el problema y aumenten su limpieza en este lugar. Gracias."}
{"text":"I got a xarne asada burrito to go the place was loud which isnt super abnormal but i hate that aside from the child making piercing noises with his toy whistle the tv i was sat next to is blaring so that im yelling while i sit at my table. The food... was one of my top least favorite food experiences had i known what it contained id have skipped it. So the meat,  super chewy and fatty and not actually flavorful but juicy. The burrito came with what seemed like salvadoran curtido (cabbage soaked in vinegar) which by the time i got home made my burrito sopping wet and disgusting along with the fatty chewy meat. So i ate the teeny tiny portion of rice and beans and picked off what i could. Overall.. Would never return"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic!!! I love this place!! Great customer service too! Good prices to go with all that great hospice."}
{"text":"I called in to place an order for pick up. I got the order of birria de res, which comes with cilantro, onion, lime and cabbage garnishes and plenty of tortillas. I live just about a mile away, and in the 4 minutes it took me to get there my order was ready. I saw that you could order a side of cheese so I asked for some to go as well. My total came out to $9.99, and left my girlfriend and I completely satisfied. Plenty of food for such a low price, we had enough for 3 full tacos each. Angelica, the cashier was very nice and quick. Highly recommend for delicious birria, its amazing!"}
{"text":"Love it here.. The birria de chivo is on point! Also the tacos are great too!!! They are big enough to make two tacos. Plus I love that they have bichis so when u want to order other items besides birria you can still have a little \"taste\" of birria"}
{"text":"The birria is very yummy ! The tacos okay but it is a birria place so that is the thing to order! The service was average. Hate to say it but the waitresses are kind of bitchy, not all but most. The more gracias I give the less they care. But I don't care bring me the birria and I'll ignore ."}
