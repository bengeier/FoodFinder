{"text":"The shisha are very good. One of the better shisha lounges in Toronto. 

I was out with a couple of friends and we were looking for a place to hang out. As we were walking down Dundas from eaton centre, we saw layalina shisha lounge. The front windows were open and it looked lively. So we thought why not. 

The customer service is very good, although the music is a bit loud at times. My friend tried the cordon bleu, it was alright for a shisha lounge. I'd recommend it for others to try. The front windows being open makes the air ventilate around which helps it not smell. I'll be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Relaxing environment
Bright reds
It's a Shisha Bar. What else can I say but enjoy hanging out with your friends."}
{"text":"Staff were too busy socializing w one another, took almost 30 minutes to receive my hooka which wasn't the greatest. Also, the music sucked! They would never let a whole song play, just kept switching songs constantly. How am I suppose to vibe to that? Overall, for someone coming from out of town, I didn't enjoy the experience here. Try another hooka lounge."}
{"text":"Nice hookah spot. Love the ambiance and the Turkish tea was great. Staff is very accommodating. Tables are a little uneven. The hookah was average, the Layalina mix with mint had good taste but didn't hit as strong as I would've liked. I'd come back tho! Great place to come with a friend or a group!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 we went there on a Saturday night. Got a table rather quickly which turned out to be the only good part of the experience. 

The waitress was exceptionally rude and curt. She behaved like she hardly had time for us and rushed us to make our decision. There is absolutely NO food available. In fact, 80% of the items on the menu are apparently not available. 

They force you to buy one shisha per 2 people. While that is fine, they insist that they take only cash and also force you to buy things to bring the bill to a certain amount which turned out to be more than $60!!

The shisha itself, was poorly made and the flavour started burning in 10 minutes. Not one person came to check on us and ask how we were doing. We tried several times to flag someone down and no one came. The teas and smoothies that we got were as POOR as they come. 

I have NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED with a restaurant in my experience."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Hookah took way too long to come out. I think they forgot about us. Hookah wasn't even started for us as a curtesy. DJ was wack as hell, played each song for like 45 seconds before switching to the next song, couldn't even get a flow going. We dipped out early and gave our hookah to someone else."}
{"text":"They keeping moving you around from your spot there have been multiple occasions they've done this. They only take cash."}
{"text":"I like to try hookah spots in different cities. This one popped up on yelp so we decided to give it a try. Not a bad place at all. 

The atmosphere was inviting and fun. The music is going and people are having a good time. A great and diverse group.

The hookah was alright- definitely not my fave. We got the Layalina (house mix) with mint. Just know, you have to do your own coals and get it started. A little different from what I'm used to back home.

We ordered the mint tea and it was delicious! We didn't order food but they do offer it and it looked good.

Prices aren't bad either. The staff is so nice but a little slow. When you're done, you checkout at the front."}
{"text":"Being a serious shisha lover, I would say this spot has better shisha than most spots downtown. However don't expect good customer service and make sure you ask for coconut coal instead of magic coal! 

This shisha cafe also serves tobacco shisha instead of the usual herbal shisha which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Decent shisha, especially for light up coals. Good atmosphere and strong Turkish coffee.
Would come again"}
