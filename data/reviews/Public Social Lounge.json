{"text":"Vodka. 

This place has a vodka menu beyond compare. Our eyes bulged when we were presented with the list of this delicious spirit. 

I started slowly with a double-shot of root beer and vanilla, topped with tonic ... and then moved on to the chocolate. (360 double-pressed is the best if you can find it here).

The drinks bookended veggie spring rolls (not too greasy) and a steak sandwich, done to medium-rare perfection. The presentation of the food - a heaping scoop of mashed potatoes adorned with a sprig or rosemary and seasonal vegetables - made me smile.

We went on the night of a hockey game, though, so it was filled with noisy douchebags moaning loudly whenever a player missed the net by five feet.

The pub also has a club-ish area attached where they have retro 90s night on Thursdays. Wait ... the 90s are retro now? That must be why I thought the hockey fans were noisy douchebags. F*ck, I'm old.

I would like to sample some other fare off the menu at Public Social House. This place has come a long way since it was a Beckham's location.

Both menus."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of their food.  The philly cheese steak sandwich was too salty for my taste and ironically, their wings were really bland."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about the drink selection at Public a friend and I hit it up to watch a playoffs game.

We sat at the bar and ordered some appies which were quite decent. The calamari was nice and the Asian BBQ poutine (think sweet & sour) was something I'd order every time I'd go in.

Ordering drinks proved more challenging.

While they were out of some of their more rare beer selections (understandable) the bartender felt the need to disagree with us on our beer selections. We just kept politely insisting and she brought them.

Then, when we tried to order some double espresso vodka off their impressive vodka list this happened:

\"Oh, you don't want that vodka!\"

\"We don't?!\"

\"No. It tastes too much like coffee\".

Why else would we order double espresso vodka?

She then recommended  some other vodka that tastes like cotton candy. No thanks.

Finally, we were able to get the vodka of our choice, and we enjoyed it.

There's nothing wrong with staff giving your their informed opinions on what they have in stock, if well trained I trust them.

However, my palette differs significantly than that of a 21-year old female bartender and I wouldn't be caught dead drinking cotton candy vodka.

Best case scenario: pour me a sample of the vodka, if I hate it, I'll change the order.

Anyways, it was a disappointing introduction to a place in my neighbourhood. I believe I'll sit at a table next visit."}
