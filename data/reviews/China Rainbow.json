{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food you will ever eat. Then, you'll get to taste it again as it comes back up. I had the worst bout with food poisoning of my entire life after eating here. Perhaps it was just their almond chicken, but I won't be going back to eat any of their other dishes ever again. I warn everyone I can about this place when it comes up in conversation. If you want good Chinese, drive a little bit further southwest to Big Heng on 75th and Peoria. Far superior food for less money, and you won't throw it up."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, I love it! The people that work there are very friendly, the place is clean and the food is amazing! I use to get the orange Chicken a lot but now it's all about the Bok Choy with black bean sauce! Veggie Fried Rice & Shrimp with Lobster sauce are also bomb! Try it out for yourself and you'll be the judge."}
{"text":"Ordered the house chow mien for take-out tonight and it didn't have any flavor. Thank goodness for the single packet of soy.... This being said, all ingredients were obviously fresh.  The portion size, lack of eating utensil or flavor, single soy and fortune cookie made this not so great of a value for 10 bucks.  I'll go down the street to my old standby Wing Hing next time."}
{"text":"I moved here in 1999. Tried a few places but China Rainbow has my wife and I as well as the kids coming back time after time.  The orange beef is great and the kids love the orange chicken.  I'm a sweet and sour guy which I order almost every time. We eat here at least 4 times a month since 99. LOVE IT....."}
{"text":"This was our second time having china rainbow, and I can officially say that I am a fan. I decided we would try this place because it has two unusual proteins for a valley menu, Lamb and Duck. I'm used to these at nicer resturants back east but not out here. My wife had the Yuling Chicken the first time we went and I can say it was great. A full chicken breast fried in batter and perfect with the delicious yuling sauce and I had hunan lamb good and spicy...super spicy and tasty. I didn't care for the water chestnuts in the wonton soup otherwise it was good.   Tonight we got takeout and I took the plunge and got the yuling duck and the wife got orange chicken. The menu \"highly recommends\" the orange chicken and for good reason, It was really good. I would order it for myself everytime we go but I'm gonna try something new next time. I got the fried wonton appetizer which was a waste of money even if it was just $3 it was just fried wonton wrappers with no filling I was expecting actual soup fried wontons or for them to be stuffed with something. Still a great place with really good and very reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 12 years now and have always been given great service and good food from day 1.   Tucked away in a little strip mall this spot has been the only consistent establishment through the turnstile of businesses that have come and gone. Being said it serves up consistent good meals and solid with the customer service. For example I popped in tonight with a 2 meal take out and they threw in a large egg drop soup on the house.   Orange beef is good as well as the vegetable egg foo yung. Nice reliable place and same owners since I've started going here."}
{"text":"I love this place! Delicious Chinese food with a few hard-to-find items. I personally love the deep-fried tofu with orange sauce! It's amazing! I'm vegan and they always accommodate me, and that is very important to me. I love that it's always clean and they also serve beer. During lunch it's very affordable with big portions. I've been coming here with my family for over 10 years. It's the best Chinese restaurant in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Surprisingly inexpensive great place for lunch huge portions great tasting food. Authentic Chinese food well-made very hot in temperature nothing cold the supposed to be hot. Nice people usually not crowded so nice place for conversation."}
{"text":"The orange chicken was very good.  I had the fried rice too and I wasn't disappointed.  I placed the order for pick up and it was ready when I got there."}
{"text":"Food came out at different times. Food was okay nothing outstanding. Would i go again? Probably not I have had better china food nearby this place thats cheaper and the customer service is way better."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times already. The beef lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and rice is good. I would give it 5 stars but I really like pot stickers and theirs are not so great. I ate one and threw away the rest. Their crab puffs are alright, very cute but taste wise is okay.  I will continue to go here because the ladies up front are very nice and it's fast."}
{"text":"If you're new to the area or visiting, and looking for an amazing Chinese restaurant look no more! There is nothing bad on this menu, they are all so friendly and it is very clean. We have been coming here for 12 years and I haven't been disappointed yet! Try the orange chicken, egg foo young or the lo mein! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for 3 yrs and never thought to try it. Well I did tonight and will definitely be coming back. All the food tasted fresh and absolutely great. I am so shocked this place doesn't get more business. Awesome, awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome Egg Foo Young! We have been searching for a while for a good Chinese delivery restaurant. We have tried them all in this area and none compare to China Rainbow. The service is fast, professional and courteous. We love the young lady that takes your order for Call in delivery. The food we have ordered has been delicious and consistent and they have always gotten our order correct. :)   Matt.   Glendale, AZ"}
{"text":"Yuck....need I say more? Why yes I do. I love crab puffs and theirs are sweet!The filling tasted like vanilla icing rather than cream cheese.   Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention the entree's. Hmmmm..nope I don't have the words. Just don't go."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday around 2pm. We ordered the Seafood Platter and Scallops with Garlic Sauce. Order was taken promptly. Food came out hot, but was brought out at different times. We noticed this was the case with another table as well. Vegetables were fresh and crisp. Sauces were flavorful. Liked the spicey red pepper sauce that was on the table. The scallops were a bit rubbery and tasteless. Definitely wouldn't order the scallops again.   Overall, food was okay. Nothing exceptional. Service was good. I would go back if in the neighborhood, but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and always thoroughly enjoy the food.  It's always high quality.  We especially love there lunch specials."}
{"text":"I'm still looking for that great Chinese place on the West side, that delivers. Am I dreaming the impossible dream? Apparently so.  In the meantime, I have China Rainbow. It is in my neighborhood. It is decent. I've never had anything that was outright bad, just unremarkable. They do not deliver.   I appreciate that their veggies are not overcooked. The quality of chicken that they use could be improved somewhat. I think they use thighs.  I also always need to spice up my food a little bit. Sambal Olek is my friend. The noodles, however,  are really, really tasty -- though, a touch oily. They have that slightly chewy texture I adore.  Is it my ideal Chinese restaurant? No. Will it suffice? Certainly.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that their crispy duck is rather good!"}
{"text":"Please read the whole review to know just how awful this place is. I went to China Rainbow to try the place with a coupon from the Entertainment Book. The food was horrible! I had Kung Pau chicken and my girlfriend had Sweet and Sour shrimp. Neither of us could take more than a few bites. I knew I would not go back but I did not complain...not until they refused their coupon. I was told we ordered food that was excluded from the coupon. Nowhere did it say anything about exclusion.  Not the coupon, not a sign in the restaurant, not on the menu. Stay away!  Oh...and the fried rice was white rice mixed with soy sauce!  No...I am not kidding or exaggerating!"}
{"text":"1)  Oil tasted old. 2)  Bug in sweet and sour sauce"}
{"text":"Great food for the price.  This restaurant has been up and running since at least 2003 to my knowledge and the food has not changed.  Great for take out which is most of their business so don't be fooled by the empty dining room.  Will also deliver if you call and request it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time the low main was really good I ordered with shrimp and spicy really good really hot  But the rice and soup seemed not as hot and might have been reheated from the day befor might have been because I came right when they opened but that's no excuse everything should always be fresh I think I would come back for dinner not lunch"}
{"text":"I like this place, friendly staff, quick service and decent food.  They have a nice selection of options.  I really like their egg drop soup.  My favorite is the orange chicken.    They have combo options for lunch and dinner.   I just order an entree and side of soup and take half home.  Combos are great value with a lot of food.   Give it a try.   I have been 3 times in two months.   Only once was it loud and it was one woman, not sure if her 3 dinner guests got a word in.  LOL"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for at least 8 years now. It's actually my mother and father's to-go spot for Chinese food. They love it here!That being said, if you prefer a small intimate restaurant with not many people there this is your place. I've has lots of Chinese food in my lifetime but I can honestly say the small \"home like\"  environment is what I prefer but others might consider it a \"hope in the wall\" restaurant. Tip: sometimes the hole in the wall spot are the best!! The locations works perfect for us because it's in a plaza and there is a big lots a few stores down. We like to have dinner then walk over to big lots for a little shopping. Anything you order is great. My favorite has to be the shrimp and vegetables in the brown sauce comes in a combination plate with fried rice, crab puff, fried wing, egg roll, and my absolute fav egg drop soup. I've had their soft noddles, orange chicken, and a few other dishes and all have great sauces and great flavor! And all in reasonable prices!! Above all this, gotta say their customer service is beyond awesome! Waitress knows us, she knows what we like, and never fails to make us feel welcomed every single time! It's defiantly a gotta try! ;)"}
{"text":"Cheap chinese food that is relatively tasty. I believe their menu claims to be the \"most authentic mandarin, hunan, and schezwan in town\" but seeing that I am from none of those backgrounds, I can't really tell if that's true. The food didn't give me a stomach ache so to me that is good enough for 3 stars, though it's a bit salty.  The food is ridiculously cheap, with lunch plates running for only $5 (including entree, soup, egg roll, fried rice, fried chicken and a crab puff). The other combos are only about $7. We all had different plates since some people didn't want to do it family style and make use of our lazy susan! Everyone seemed pretty satisfied and my friend who had the house special duck really enjoyed his meal. I liked my combo of shrimp and vegetables. They didn't skimp on the shrimp   Too bad there were only 2 other customers aside from our group of 7. I think they should get more business.   Oh, and they give free steamed rice and tea with your meals. I like asian places that don't charge for tea. That would be like charging for water."}
{"text":"The worse I called up to order Chinese food from this place I ordered from them on a Friday night on January 12th 2018 and my order was a $38 order I called the next day on Saturday to order and I know the rules and regulation that it's a minimum of $20 for delivery I ordered what I wanted to order and my total came out to $19.97 the girl said I got to order more things to make it to $20 to make the delivery happen so I added on some crab Puffs to my order and that made it to $24 then the lady told me it's going to be $2.80 for the delivery on top of it after when I put my order in I told the lady first of all I was at $19.97 you couldn't add the tax to that and it would have been $20 and then you could come and deliver it she said no we have to get the $20 in before the taxes are added into the price . So then I said well I'm at $19.97 how about that $2.80 for the delivery charge your charge me doesn't it added up to $20 and she laughed at me it seemed like the price keep going up and up and up for every little thing that is bullshit!!"}
{"text":"All four of us did not like the food. We are from the East Coast so we expected it to be different, but it wasn't even tasty. Very nice and friendly, but service was weird, bringing one dish at a time. They brought my Egg Foo Young, and then got a plate for me to eat off, and then I had to ask if I get rice, she said yes, its coming.  Did this for each one of us, one at time.  Also only ONE bowl of rice for the whole table. NO crisp noodles and sweet dipping sauce while we waited for our orders, every Chinese Restaurant I have ever gone to gives you the crispy noodles and sauce refills if you want them. Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"It's nice that they serve alcohol here but the food seems really bland. I had the fried rice and orange chicken and really was not impressed. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the most and I mean most horrible Chinese food I have ever tried in my life. It was $50 for our dinner, orange chicken, spicy honey chicken, teriyaki chicken, won tons, crab puffs. Honestly I read the reviews and almost all reviews were pretty damn solid, there were only 2 that were red flags, wholly cow let me tell you the 2 bad reviews were spot on!  I literally took one bite of each of the entrees and spit in the garbage, even the wontons were bad, crab puffs are always good right? No they were horrible here! It wasn't cream cheese it had to have been like the stuff that comes in the little packets that you squeeze on toaster strudels.....   The only edible item was the white rice, the entire family was in agreement and we tossed our $50 in the garbage."}
{"text":"Quick tasty and deliverable . For a local restaurant it's pretty good. The prices are right in the tasty duck is quite good."}
{"text":"I have been getting food here for almost 10 years now. They've got great food, service is always super fast, and the prices are great. Great destination if you're looking for a quick bite to eat during your lunch break.   Check out the garlic chicken; it's worth it."}
{"text":"Was not thrilled with the food... It was very bland. I ordered chew-mien which came noodle-less!  They were full of onions and celery. The noodles came dry on the side... Weird! I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food! Ordered through Eat24 app. This was our first time here and we liked it. No issues, will come back"}
{"text":"This neighborhood chinese restaurant is awesome and has been around for years! Great food for the affordable prices. We usually get it to go and they are always quick and the food taste fresh. Bonus points for them thinking about customers who order take out and make it easy for you to take home by packaging it in a box. Orange chicken is definitely our favorite!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I've found in the Phoenix area I must admit! Good food overall and relaxing atmosphere. Decent spot for family night or date night."}
{"text":"The first time I had china rainbow I was 10 I think and I live in the east valley (currently Maricopa) I still drive all the way out here for orange chicken and low mein. I love them I'm 21 and still have not found a place as good, the owner knows me by name and is always friendly as can be. If you haven't gone there try it you will love it as for the food poisoning review who hasn't gotten it once in there life things happen I've eaten at china rainbow 100 plus times in 11 years and I've never been sick. If you don't know what to get order orange chicken you will be back!"}
{"text":"New owners. Back to being good. Alcohol is back, portions are now GINORMOUS during lunch special. Arrive hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! The lunch combos are spectacular and worth the 5 to $6 you pay for them. I I had the Mongolian beef last week and I had to return twice that week to have it a second time it was so good. Each combo comes with hot tea and water, but they also serve Pepsi products including Dr Pepper"}
{"text":"This place has continued to go down-hill. I am sad to say, because I know it is a family ran business. I write this review in hopes that they will wake up and do it like they used to do!! Many years ago I used to actually like this place!! Last time my hubby and I were there, there was a terrible odor. We wanted to walk out but felt stuck since we were immediately greeted.   Clean up the place and cook like you used to cook!! You know how to do it right! Step it back up in order to keep your business alive!!!"}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone. I order orange tofu with rice. Over my break, I went to pick up my food. The restaurant had a really strange ordor and it was a bit messy.  When I went back to work, I ate the rice first. After I finished my rice, I opened the box of orange tofu. The tofu looked like melted marshmallows. I took a bite of the tofu and it tasted like candle wax. It was extremely disgusting! I went back to the restaurant and I let the employee know that there was something wrong with the tofu. She told me that I did not know what I was talking about, she was very hesitant on giving me my money back. She was clearly upset, she was slamming stuff and raising her voice at me. After, five minutes she gave me my money back in a very aggressive manner! I was very polite, I said thank you and sorry for the inconvenience; she completely ignored me and turned her back.  update: I got food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the late 1990s, and never once did I have bad food.  Their lunch prices can't be beat, and their food is just great.  The service is always attentive and the place is clean.  Very nice people, too,"}
{"text":"I ordered take out and the Moo Shu Pork would have been good if it weren't for the wrappers, which were store bought tortillas.  That short cut ruins the dish.  On my previous visit here they served it with traditional Moo Shu Pancakes, not store bought tortillas.  I won't be back."}
