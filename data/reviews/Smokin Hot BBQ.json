{"text":"These guys are amazing! We catered our son's engagement party last saturday and the food was beyond amazing! Charles was great to work with, very professional, and set everything up without a hitch. We had around 70 people and they all raved about the food. The brisket and the mac and cheese were the favorites but the green chili sauce was the first to go! Highly recommend their sauces.  I would definitely use them again."}
{"text":"My son and I had the pleasure of some amazing pork and brisket sliders. It was all awesome and I would strongly encourage anyone to try it out."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from the pulled pork. Had explosive diarrhea for days, and poltergeist like vomiting. As much as I love pulled pork I'm not a fan of capping my pants. I should have listened to the warning signs. The truck reeked of communism."}
{"text":"Charles and his team are very nice, and their BBQ isn't bad either - but their sauces were over the top delicious! We had them come out to our office and two of our job sites for employee appreciation/4th of July BBQ's. They served the food to every one to help with portion control and they were very professional and pleasant."}
{"text":"Delicious. Couldn't ask for a better bbq. A must try if you see them anywhere. The food is delicious and the customer service is impeccable. You won't be sorry after tasting their BBQ. I can't say more about the taste of their food!!"}
{"text":"We ate today at the Street Eats Food Truck Festival at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick. My wife and I tried several of the $2.00 samples but when we ate a pulled pork sample with coleslaw at Smokin' Hot BBQ we hit the jackpot. Wonderful food and wonderful people. The meat was incredible and the coleslaw with pineapple and jalape√±o was incredible. Loved it."}
{"text":"Smokin' Hot BBQ is FABULOUS!  All 40 of the guests raved about the food!

We had a Halloween theme/corporate event at a residence.  Charles was very professional, on time/early, with a very smooth set up. Everything was executed perfectly (and I'm somewhat of a stickler for details!).  That's a real compliment to Charles.

Now, let's talk about the FOOD! Dinner was served, and the food was flavorful, mouth watering, absolutely wonderful!  We all enjoyed the DELICIOUS Beef Brisket, Chicken & Pork Sliders, Jalapeno & Pineapple Coleslaw etc.

THANK YOU CHARLES for the SMOKIN' HOT BBQ!"}
{"text":"I had catering by Smokin Hot BBQ for my husband's 50th bday party. Charles and company showed up on time. They are professional and organized. We had the Brisket and Chicken breast along with Mac & cheese and potato salad. Everything was delicious, but the brisket was the BEST!!!! The sauces too die for, I loved the spicy!! I will definitely use them again. They were the hit of the party."}
{"text":"Smokin' Hot BBQ came out to MASTER Electronics and it was very good!

Charles is very professional and makes the BBQ experience a lot of fun. I got the rib tips and the 5-cheese Macn'cheese and it was pretty delicious! 

I recommend business to definitely book Smokin' Hot BBQ for office lunches, events and more!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I love BBQ and this food truck did it right!

I initially was going to get a pulled pork and brisket slider however my coworker said they preferred the chicken over the brisket. I ended up doing one pulled pork and one chicken with a side of the Mac and cheese. 

The meat was top quality. Very tender and juicy. Nothing was dry. I used the spicy, honey bourbon, and original bbq sauces. They were all very good and flavorful. 

The Mac and cheese was great!  Noodles were soft and the cheese was awesome. I need this recipe!

Definitely a spot to stop by if they're near you."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's delish sadly I know longer work at my old company where they use to come all the time! Food is great customer service is great. The Mac and cheese is soo good. It sells out fast."}
{"text":"Smoking Hot BBQ came to our work for our monthly food truck event. The staff was super friendly and the food was incredible! 

I got the 2 shredded pork sliders with side of mac and cheese. The pork was juicy and had a ton of flavor. I used their original BBQ sauce that was super tasty. The mac and cheese was super good as well. It was a meal I didn't want to end. 

Looking forward to eating here again in the future! Thanks (:"}
{"text":"This was the local food truck that made a stop in front of my workplace, at first I was undecided with BBQ or the other food truck. What broke the tie was just the fact the smell spewing from the food truck of BBQ was irresistible! I like the selection of the pulled pork, chicken and beef brisket options. I had two of the mini sliders with chicken and beef, combined with mac n cheese."}
{"text":"This company is nothing but a joke. They were booked for a unity rally today and walked out on their commitment because they didn't like our \"politics\"  We were honoring veterans law enforcement and military fallen heroes and trying to improve unity in our country and they just walked out on the event. Nobody should trust these clowns."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite BBQ. So glad they are finally selling their sauces as well. Picked up one of each flavor last week and made some shredded BBQ chicken with the Honey Bourbon and it was SOOO good.

Can't wait to try out the spicy next :)"}
{"text":"I just had the rib tips and mac 'n cheese from this business at a food truck event at my job. Excellent ribs and above average mac 'n cheese. Looking forward to seeing their truck at another event!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite BBQ place to date. I looooove this truck and look forward to it every time it visits my job. The pulled chicken sandwiches are heaven, I just wish the servings were bigger! They also have amazing sauces, definitely a must have. There is always a line when I come here and I will happily wait in it to get in on some of the action every time!"}
{"text":"Always a nice place to eat after service on Sundays! Love the choices of meats and sides...my personal faves are the brisket, mac&cheese, cheesy potatoes and turkey. They also have China Mist iced tea which is a bonus. Sevice is simple - you slide your tray, cafeteria style and order what you'd like as you move down the counter. I actually like the simple cobbler too. Solid bbq food and nice atmosphere."}
