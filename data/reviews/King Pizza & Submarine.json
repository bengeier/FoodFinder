{"text":"It is under new ownership now and doesnt taste as good as it used to. And it is too expensive and too much on the menu."}
{"text":"Just sharing our experience at Georgetown Oldest Pizza joint!

Placed order at 7:50pm on a Friday night for a 35-40 min delivery for 7.2 kms away. GREAT!
Called at 8:40 making sure the delivery went out.
25 mins later..........
 Pizza arrived at 9:05 pm.

Delivery driver had an attitude problem. But maybe he was having a bad day. 

Pizza was cold
Wings were cold


Called once again, only to get excuses. These guys have every excuse under the sun!

The thing is instead of coming to a resolution and apologizing they just offered up excuses. Now I get to write out this experience and share it with wary buyers.

In my family's  opnion we are sorry to say but King Pizza should loose the title for being Georgetown oldest pizza joint."}
{"text":"King Pizza used to be the best pizza in town, there wasn't even a close 2nd.  After several new owners, the quality is gone, high prices remain.

Pizza was under cooked, lacking in toppings.  Wings are good because they are deep fried and fresh, unusual for a pizza place.  

Sorry, another great local spot is gone."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Wings were good. Burger is horrible, I couldn't even eat it. And the nachos were not good at all. I ordered delivery and they were inedible"}
{"text":"Best panzarotti in town. They're huge. Great service. Fast delivery. Love the party platter they offer. Great quick option to feed a group."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and great food! Can't go wrong with this choice. Ordered a pepperoni hot peppers and pineapple panzerotti, it was good. Burgers where good also. Thanks for all the hospitality, staff really took care of us, brought a extra set of knives and forks for is even though we didn't ask but needed them, extremely attentive. Will come back 100%"}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to try too many things on their menu but I'm for sure not a fan of their pizzas. Their poutine is ok but the gravy has big lumps in it which kinda grosses me out. My boyfriend has had a few things off their menu and said it tasted like the oil in the deep fryer hadn't been changed in a while. I hate writing bad reviews cause maybe it was an off day which is why I will give it one more try. If anyone has suggestions on what I should try please let me know!"}
