{"text":"I've come to this location via drive thru a few times. Tonight I got home and I didn't receive my fries. I got my side of cheese sauce for my fries :(. Sucks. Not worth to call or go back but still really irritating because it was payed for."}
{"text":"Of my entire life. i have never been to a fast food restaurant that sold out of soda."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is located at Bayview and Major Mac at the North East corner - in that plaza. You might be wondering if this used to be a Burger King... yes, it did and someone burned it down, now it's a Wendy's.  This Wendy's has a bunch of parking and from the outside, it looks very new, sleek and up with the times. Going in, it's very clean - staff seem pretty happy here (do they have cameras and microphones on them?! LOL kidding) and I generally go for a baconator combo. I love the baconator, it is DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  Peak times are around noon (obviously) but it's busier than normal because there's a high school RIGHT beside the plaza, so if you want to beat the rush, you might want to go a little earlier!  All in all, it's great for fast food and while it's a little pricier than McDonald's or Burger King, Wendy's quality for the price is worth it.  3.5/5!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, finally, the sun is shining and it's 19C outside! It must be time for a Frosty!  I wish this place was closer to home. It's bigger and nicer looking than the one near my home and the service is better! That's my big beef with the Pickering location!  I've always found Wendy's to be fairly consistent with their food but service sets them apart. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Brand new location with lots of space. Many power outlets with USB plugs, and the wifi is a decent speed.  The food is the usual Wendy's fare, with burgers and salads being the main attraction. Service was fast, the staff was friendly, and the place is spotlessly clean.  Downrated again because wifi is blocked during lunch again."}
{"text":"Food tasted like Wendy's but everytime i've ordered something through the drivethru, someone who works there will forget something. So my advice is to just double check your order is there, as you should anyways with any other restaurant due to human error. It happens."}
