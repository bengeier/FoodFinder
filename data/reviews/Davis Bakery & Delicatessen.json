{"text":"Awesome breakfast. Quick service. Never crowded. Nice people. Love their baked goods."}
{"text":"I LOVE this bakery.  I used to work on Chagrin blvd over 20 years ago and used to stop by several times a week. So when we came back home for a visit, Davis was our first stop.  We ordered a couple different things to go and all were beyond fantastic.  I LOVE the way they wrap the box up with string!!!  Just like they did years ago :).  I placed an order to go Russian Tea Biscuits and chocolate coconut bars (both to die for)!!!!  They were so great. They asked me if I would like it packed for travel and they did an excellent job!  My bakery is safe at home with me in Atlanta now.  It was worth the plane ticket to go just go back to Davis Bakery LOL!!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh. The coconut bars are the best in the city. Rye bread is second to none not mention the chocolate chip cookies. There is nothing not to like"}
{"text":"Davis Bakery has the best Jewish rye bread.  We drive from the Akron /Canton area whenever we need rye bread."}
{"text":"Rude...Rude....Rude! On a Saturday night my friends and I decided to stop in Davis's Bakery & Delicatessen in Woodmere for a yummy after dinner dessert treat. After gathering a handful of sweet goodies my girlfriend stood at the deli counter and inquired about the price per pound for their smoked honey ham. A white-haired gentleman behind the counter grumbled the price at her and when she said \"Yes, I'll take a pound of that\" he barked \"I'm not waiting on you.\" And proceeded to turn around and go about his business. My friend chose not to make a big deal out of it and  went to go check out at the bakery with her sweets. She did however mention to the cashier what had been said at the deli counter.  The cashier responded with  \"Well you have to imagine how some of our customers talk to us so you don't need to take it personally.\" My girlfriend said \"Well that doesnt make it right.\" The cashier then turned away from her and began checking out the next person in line. Needless to say we left. Rudest customer service any of us have ever experienced .....Won't be going back EVER!"}
{"text":"Great deli/bakery.  Delicious lox and shmear. The bagels are eggy and fluffy, but still pretty good.  The real standout is the bakery. Fantastic pastries! My mother is a fan of their cookies, but I prefer the bear claws and Russian tea biscuits (a must).  You will not be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I love Davis Bakery.  Their breads elevate any sandwich they offer. The boyz behind the deli counter are all great and know their deli.  On one side, you can order a great deli sandwich from the boyz... Turn 180 degrees and you will be staring at a very impressive assortment of baked goods.  I am keen on their knishes because they are on the healthy side (for knishes) and if you want a matzo ball soup that tastes like mom used to make, you have found it.  Some of my other addictions include their seafood salad, egg salad, challas and last but not least; their roast beef sandwich with chopped liver, tomato and munster cheese on fresh rye bread. Keep thinking that's gross... I don't care / your loss."}
{"text":"Davis bakery is one of my favorite places to get a sandwich, cookie, local soda, kosher bakery, and more! I've been going there for a long time as I was born and raised in Cleveland, and Davis never fails to entice me! They just added a new dining room, which has made it a bit more crowded, but for a good reason. Their cakes and cookies are to DIE for, they just have this kind of aftertaste, almost like almonds, that sticks with all their baked goods. Delicious! They have a wide array of bread, meats, sandwich fixings, soups, traditional Jewish baked goods, and more. I buy their matzo ball mix for Hanukkah, and it always comes out great! I remember my grandpa would always bring my family coconut bars from Davis, and they are some of the best I've ever had. To the people saying that they come in from other states to get them: you've got the right idea! Everything there is absolutely delicious and I love the vintage feel."}
{"text":"$9.00 is the standard price for a standard, and I mean standard, deli sandwich.  It looks like they bake a few things in-house like loaves of bread.  The place felt dirty to me and I felt sick after eating my sandwich so I won't go back."}
{"text":"The world's best brownies are right here in the bakery case. With or without nuts, you'll need coffee(or a glass of icy cold milk), and you're all set. Great bread, nice bakery selection."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try out someplace new but ended up not getting anything. They had a variety of items just not what we were looking for and the few things we asked about the young man had a hard time telling us what they were.... so we decided to try again another day maybe. I will say they had a large selection of deli items and such as well but it just was not what we were looking for on this particular trip."}
{"text":"Best cake I've had in my life. They did my wedding cake. The design was not 100% right color wise but we were more about flavor than designs. If you want good design but most expensive go to White flower cake shop. The food is good here too."}
{"text":"When I'm up here, I always have the Ruben! Fantastic staff, smells fantastic from the fresh baked goods and a reasonable price. I would recommend this as a stop anytime you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This deli hasn't changed much over the years - a good thing!! The chocolate muffins are to-die-for, but they usually run out every morning by 9am. Their Rye bread is some of the best I've ever had, and they are known for the \"coconut cake\" (basically the size of a brownie, comes in chocolate as well). I've heard of people flying in from L.A. for the coconut cake - it's a Cleveland original. The kichel is delicious. i would HIGHLY recommend their corned beef - it's excellent!!! This is not a Kosher deli, but their potato salad, cole slaw, and their other deli meats are all fantastic. Service can be slow at times because there is usually only 1 person behind the deli counter, and 1 person behind the bread/bakery counter. I promise, this one is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped in around 2:00pm for a hot pastrami sandwich. In the past, they have been delicious, warm, juicy and generous as you would expect from a deli. The sandwich was about one inch thick at it thickest in the center. You know how they usually mound it up... When the elderly gent was making it, he grabbed a bagged portion and microwaved it. (The microwaving made the meat dried out around the edges.) I asked him about it, as I saw they were slicing the corned beef on the slicer and you could see the steam coming off the slicer...I was informed that was the way they always do their pastrami. I had been in six months earlier and had a much nicer sandwich that was moist, generous and delicious. I had taken it to my car to eat and was so disappointed. The bread seemed old, and I had paid for swiss cheese which he neglected to put on the sandwich. I took the sandwich with one bite missing and asked about the size and the cheese. The man who made it said \"5 ounces!\", he had a young man put the cheese on it and handed it back to me. If your interested in paying $9.00 for a junior pastrami with nuked meat this is your place. Pastries are delicious, but I'll go to Slyman's down the road for my sandwich."}
{"text":"Having grown up on Davis' baked goods and deli from the time Eastgate opened in the mid-1950s, it was difficult to watch the chain of many bakeries downsize constantly over many years.  But the remaining factory and store, and the one store remaining in a shopping center--in Woodmere across from Eaton, haven't missed a beat.  Davis has the best rye bread--ever.  And the best coconut bars.  And the best rolls--both Kaiser and egg.  And my personal favorite--bagel chips--can't be duplicated.  And the Deli--excellent corned beef, turkey off the bone, and potato salad.  I love stopping by for a sandwich to go--made expertly by the deli counter people.  The only downside has always been the same--the women behind the bakery counters and at the registers are frequently down-right nasty!  So--what else could I ask for?  Do you want to become a hero to your out of town friends and relatives who used to live in Cleveland?  Go to this website:   https://davisbakery.net/shop/ or call 216-464-5599 to place an order to be delivered to almost anywhere.  My friends and relatives ALWAYS remember this gift from \"home\" from Davis Bakery!  PS:  Just remembered that they have the BEST Russian Tea Biscuits."}
{"text":"Davis Bakery has always been a favorite of mine for lunch. They are located in a convenient location right off I271 in Woodmere across from Eaton Collection.  Deli personnel along with their products are on par or above many other competitors in the area. The bakery products are very good to excellent, but the personnel not so much. My go to sandwich is The Tribe; a corned beef, pastrami with Swiss, coleslaw, and thousand island on panini pressed rye bread. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Three words: Russian Tea Biscuits. The best cookie/pastry anywhere. BTW: everything else is great too!"}
{"text":"I have been patronizing Davis Bakery for decades - ever since my mother used to bring us up to when you were next door to Irving's.  Although my experience with ordering the deli meats was quite pleasant, the bakery side was not.  The staff (young girls) is not properly trained.  Even though I repeated my order twice, the young lady tried stuffing the incorrect product into the bag.  When I told her I'd rather have something else, she complied. . . only to stuff more of what I did not order into a bag,then argue with me that I did.  Please train your staff on your product, as well as to listen to the customer and their needs.  As it were, I purchased what I needed at Corky and Lenny's; I knew I needed to go there for my belly lox (which you don't carry), so I ordered my bagels from them."}
{"text":"OMG, I LOVE IT HERE! I've been coming to Davis Bakery since before I could walk, and although this isn't the old Cedar Rd. location, it's still pretty darn awesome.   I feel like a cartoon bear who's smelling honey whenever I pass this place; the delicious scent of bakery goodness lifts you off your feet and drags you in the door by your nostrils. The corned beef sandwich is a 3.5/5, it tends to be a bit dry, but the pastries are 5 stars all the way. The service is always friendly and eager to help, and come Passover, you won't find better mandle bread in all of ohio. Yum."}
{"text":"We received a tray of cookies as a gift at our office. There are 12 of us and we usually end up throwing away gifts of sweets because we are not big sweet eaters. I am embarrassed to say we ate the entire large tray of cookies from Davis Bakery in 1 day. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I went to a small gingerbread event at Davis's Bakery and was impressed with the attentiveness and approachability of the staff. You could tell they loved what they do for a living and that they wanted to share their experiences with everyone who entered. Even though seating is very limited inside, spaces cleared up quickly and we were able to sit down in no time."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly because my regular bakery was closed for the holiday and I was blown away! Great treats, awesome service, and good prices! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place brings back really fond memories of my childhood.  Lots of cakes, cookies and tons of deli stuff.  Hot breakfast sandwiches all day.  Deli sandwiches made to order.  And those big kosher dill pickles swimming in the deli case.... Ahhhh"}
{"text":"I honestly can't remember when I've been to a more friendly place. I got the sandwich if the day (hot pastrami) and while I was waiting, I checked out some of the pastries without any intent on purchasing. The friendly woman behind the counter explained what some of them were and handed a few over for me to try. Wow!  I'd never had a Russian tea biscuit and I'm now forever a fan. The coconut bar was also amazing. THEN...I got the sandwich. Another big wow!  Very reasonably priced especially compared to the other restaurants in this upscale area. I will certainly return when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this bakery! I see a few people writing that it's \"dirty\" first of all, it isn't dirty. It's old. Get your facts straight.   I ordered a few things for breakfast to take home. Some danish and snuggles. They were delicious! The coffee was mediocre, but they aren't known for their coffee AND we still drank it.   As for the store itself. It's old amd has a certain charm to it. In my opinion, it's perfect. You can most definitely see the years of wear and tear on it. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"We came in to Davis Bakery while on a vacation trip to Ohio.  While on our trip we stopped by about 3 times.  Everything here is good.  The sandwiches are large and tasty.  Their bakery items are very good.  Especially the cookies.  This is like going to an old fashioned bakery.  From the pictures on the walls, it looks like this place has lots of history.  Next time we are in Ohio, we will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"We recently had a huge delivery sent to us for a family member in recovery. To my knowledge, the sender paid a hefty delivery fee. We expected the delivery \"after lunch\" -- and it didn't arrive until almost 6:30 pm. This might not sound like a huge deal, but when you're relying on a delivery during a time of need, it makes a big difference for the food to come when they say it's coming.  Overall, the food that was delivered to us was delicious. Fantastic cold cuts that are gourmet-quality, memorable pastries, excellent bread and delicious soup help Davis Bakery live up to its name. The roast beef and corned beef were lean, tender, and made wonderful sandwiches. It's hard to fight the quality of food here, just be wary of the delivery service if you need it time-sensitive. Otherwise, go for the delivery if you can spare the time or the people you're sending to won't care when it arrives."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I had the Reuben sandwich and I have to tell you for $9.50 you get a lot of food. The Reuben was stuffed with corned beef and sauerkraut which really gave my tastebuds a treat, I also ordered a side of potato salad and that had a lot of flavor. Overall I think Davis is a great place for a meal and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I can't show enough love for this place!! First thing you need to know: never miss an opportunity to get one of their coconut bars. They are amazing. The russian tea biscuits are fabulous as well. We got a tray of coconut bars from here for my wedding, and they were probably gone in ten minutes! They also have great bread, and the meat trays are definitely a go-to for all your party/bereavement needs!"}
{"text":"Hot pastrami was delicious!!!!! Awesome deli and bakery!!!! The baked goods were soooooo good and addicting!!!! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"The rugelach and Russian tea cakes are delicious.  The coconut yellow cake too.  Can't wait to try the new dine-in.  Davis used to have more locations throughout the region.  I admire their ability to adapt their business with the changing demographics of the region.  Wishing them much success and a long future."}
{"text":"Wow, the people who work the bakery counter range from unfriendly to downright rude! I stopped in to grab a pastry and while I was looking over their options one of the ladies abruptly asked if I wanted something. When I said yes, but I was checking out the options she rolled her eyes and walked away. Another woman ended up helping me and was marginally more personable, the woman at the register was mutely indifferent. The apricot tea biscuit is not great. The deli counter looked interesting, I might consider coming back to try a sandwich, but I'm at a loss to understand why a small neighborhood place would have such terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Friendly service on a Sat am, but pastries were a little underwhelming, as was the meaty breakfast sandwich. Might go back to try out the deli, but will look for another bakery."}
{"text":"A really good old fashion deli with a kicks butt bakery. Fresh Rye bread for your conred beef. yeah they are starting to weight the portions now which is a bad thing but STILL its good food at reasonable pricing. I go once or twice a week for a sandwich and a pastry. You should too."}
{"text":"Wow. Foodie heaven. Bakery case full of things with special names and explanations. Do a 180 and then face the authentic deli offerings. The dining area has a Sweet 62 gourmet soda fountain with real cane sugar; I had the vanilla cream. Tons of classic and signature bakery and deli items. You will not be disappointed here. Playing 80s rock'n'roll is a bonus. Amazing flavors here since 1939!"}
{"text":"Great deli counter and everything is very fresh. Not the same as it was 15-25 years ago, but still great!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. Honestly I've never had a bad one. Best part, you get a cookie surprise with each one.  Old school place with butcher making your sammy. Bakery yummy as well. One if the few places that makes bread my German born mom likes.  Can be tight if you go at busy time... And few chairs to sit and eat...but a nice place to pick up a bite on the way home."}
{"text":"Coconut key lime bar is SOOOO good!  Was looking for a low sodium sandwich and they bake their own turkey off the bone, which we tried and was very good.  Corned beef, although not low in sodium, but, when in Rome... Very tender, great homemade rye, just like I remembered it."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I've never set foot in Davis Bakery. I've never tried anything that didn't come off a deli tray.  But let me tell you that what I have tasted from Davis is amazing. Quality meats, cheeses and breads. The best potato salad I have ever had. And those pickles??!!! You can tell they're homemade and if you like a more cucumber-y (that's totally a word. Right?) pickle, you have to check it out.  We order from them for work events and they are always easy to deal with, reasonably priced and very accommodating. I live on the west side but have considered picking up for personal events too. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for dessert!  Stopped in hoping to find some good dessert and Davis Bakery didn't disappoint.  We got a small black forest cake and a couple other things to share.   We will be back to try more- there was so much that looked good!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while traveling on 271. Fantastic spot. Sandwich on fresh rye bread--amazing! The baked goods were really nice too. Worth the drive away from the highway, it's not too far and so awesome for lunch. There are about 8 chairs if you want to eat there."}
