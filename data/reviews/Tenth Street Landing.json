{"text":"Had a pizza which tasted ok, I've had better and worse  ... Lifted up the slices and a oil slick was on the bottom of the plate. Wife was grossed out. Ordered fish and chips and asked not to over cook the fish, it came out dark brown and stiff as a board. Reordered and was still over done, tasteless and salty. Onion flower was ok other than salty too.  Left unsatisfied and service was ok."}
{"text":"The sign says Gastro Pub. If that make you think that they serve cutting edge food or even food that you might tell a friend about...  This isn't that place.   I love the location so please avoid it long enough that somebody with a decent beer menu moves in. Unless expensive Coors Light is your thing that is.  0.5/5"}
{"text":"Love it there! Sooooo friendly & staff is amazing :) love Christian the bartender ! & all the girls r sweethearts :) thanks for the awesomeness!!!  salt & pepper wings are really good & specials r well priced"}
{"text":"FATS is gone and now replaced with Tenth Street Landing. There have been a few upgrades but the layout is still similar. There's still a few booths with their own TVs and some VLTs.   I had a build your own burger which was good and the better half had a stir fry which was ok.   We'll have to come back on a Monday for the 25% off pizza night to see if they're still as good as before.   I don't remember FATS having non bulk brand beer on tap but now they have Guiness and Kronenbourg Blanc if you're like me and can't stand Molsens/Labatts/Coors."}
{"text":"Sorry but it is NOT a gastropub.  The servers are darling and it is a fun night out in the hood, but if you have standards and tastebuds this is not your calling."}
{"text":"I used to come here since it was Fats and Fats was new. I marvelled at Fats' decline. It was like the owners were on a mission to destroy the place: first, lets get rid of the variety in beer, as well as lose everything interesting. Second, let's destroy the menu. Out with the good, in with what's bland if not gross. Third, no pretty waitresss allowed here anymore. Those who were left must have been ordered to be rude.   Well, this was supposed to be a review of the new place, not the old.  Is it owned and run by a different group? You wouldnt know it. Decor is slightly improved. Wait staff at least weren't overtly rude. Props there, I suppose. Ive been here twice in a week, and both days, my food was bland and flavourless.   I wont be back to Fat's Landing again, thanks."}
{"text":"The location is excellent and the atmosphere is casual. It seems like it would be a good place to watch a sports game (though the sound isn't on -- there's always music playing). The service has been very slow every time I have been here -- and not more than half the tables have been seated. It sometimes feels like the servers are purposely neglecting tables. The thing that keeps me coming back is the daily specials -- half off pizzas on Sunday, taco special on Fridays, etc. I wish the menu descriptions were more detailed. For example, if I'd known there would be sour cream on the grilled fish tacos, I would have asked for that to be left off. Some of these shortcomings would be easy enough to remedy, so I hope there is improvement in the future. I'd probably come here pretty often since it's near where I live."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to for the best pizza in the city. Sadly, it seems they've recently changed their dough (and the crust was the best part), leaving it almost, well, a wee bit gross. I hate to say it, since it's only a block away, but I'll be looking for a new regular pizza place from now on.   So sad. It's like getting dumped, only in this case you lose weight instead of gain it because there isn't any great pizza."}
