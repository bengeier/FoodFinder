{"text":"Despite what people say about the interior and the crazy seatings. I love that you have the little walls around you so you dont feel like people are watching you goofing around with your sushi and your chopsticks lol. The sushi were good! One of the few sushi that I have enjoyed in mississauga. The price isn't bad either! The service is okay. They don't bother you that much so nothing to really complain about. Also, the selection is crazy. Just be careful and don't order too much.. the list will overwhelm you lol. Recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited around 3:30pm and was charged for dinner ayce price. Good service and variety of items, however wasn't impressed by the Rolls quality... All rolls looked as if they were made in a hurry by a sloppy cook. Sashimi was good and fresh. Good service. Overall nice place, but average Sushi quality.  p.s. it's still better than UMI sushi which used to be in this spot before.."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a late meeting.  Decided to stop here for diner after.  What a waste of time.  My first and last time to this place.   The service was ok, Fast and polite.  The food I have other issues with.  The salmon sushi did not taste fresh.  The mini sushi pizza I had to send back as it was not edible.  The miso soup tasted like boiled water with soy sauce.  Not worth the money for dinner.  I should have gone next door for some pho.  Would have coast me half as much and would have tasted better."}
{"text":"Come here all the time. The best one to try is the Volcano Roll... Mmmm it is to die for. It's not the best one I have ever been to, but I can say its top 3 in Sauga. Service is excellent, servers are always smiling and happy to answer any questions you may have. If they can improve their drink selection I would rate it 5 star.   After only a year in business, hats off to Saki Sushi!"}
{"text":"I really liked how this restaurant is set up. All the booths are really nice. The servers also seem really nice even though not all of them know a lot about different sushi pieces off hand.  The sushi (negiri) it self was really good. I really liked the salmon and red snapper sushi. Their seaweed salad is also good. I really liked their spicy crab rolls. The Toronto roll was also really good for those who don't mind warm rolls.  The lunch price was 14.99 from what I remember and that is pretty good for an AYCE which serves quality food.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone I know."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Hands down one of my top 5 sushi bars. Not close to me (1hour away) but great enough to have a reason to visit Mississauga. Took a date here once and we had an amazing relaxed experience. Nice bonding place since we shared all the food. I can't wait for my next visit.   Every dish was delicious in its own way. From a the simple samoki sushi to a well know dragon roll.   The food all stands out and I couldn't get enough. I almost cried when I had to leave. Only sad part was that after I tried something I had no idea what it was called to order it again. And I couldn't ask since we ate it all.   Thanks for reading, it's Gabry?"}
{"text":"Good service. Great shrimp tempura, real crispy.  Always pay cash to save 10%.  I always do take out, but the restaurant is always clean and the workers are welcoming.  Red Tuna sashimi is my go to.  Good quality at a fair price.  Open 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Saki Sushi used to be one of my favourite spots for AYCE Sushi. They recently changed to Ã  la carte, which I assumed would be still as great as it was before. First it took them a while to take our order, and there was only 1-2 other tables in the restaurant. We ended up waiting 30 min for our sushi to arrive. I had to ask why it was taking it so long, and they bought just the one plate my partner ordered. I thought my order was on it's way, and waited another 10 min and had to ask for it, and only then it arrived. Our server then proceeds to tell us they are so busy with take-out...I was not impressed. I am guessing since the sushi was sitting out for so long, it was extremely dry for some reason, and the rice was very sticky - which did not make the sushi enjoyable or easy to eat. I let them know, but did not have the patience to wait another 30 min for something else.   I truly enjoyed this places before, since it wasn't just the service which was poor (a whole new set of servers than before), but the food too, I do not think I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Upon asking owner why we had to wait over 20 minutes for our food and over 10 minutes for something as simple as a drink, we were told he was very busy. We didn't give him any trouble after that but when it was time to pay the bill, I suggested he hired more employees because he faces a large amount of customers on evenings. With this suggestion he openly laughed in our faces and said 'I'm good as long as I made money off you'. Truly a joke and I would not recommend anyone giving this guy any business. Take it to any other sushi restaurant in mississauga- they are all no doubt better. It was my fault for choosing somewhere closest to home."}
{"text":"Great service but the food is not that impressive. The Beijing roll was interesting , I have seen this in other interpretations. Banana is used as one if the ingredients. Portions are very small. The gello at the end was good but boring. I would have added a few strawberries to make it more interesting vs the bland box gello I can make at home. Staff is great but there is room for improvement. I would also suggest to use fresher fish."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh and didn't taste like seawater. I went there twice and the sushi was average (I've had much better since I stopped going there). The main problem is that the staff are super rude and service is horrible. As in, roll your eyes when they take your order, ignore you when you try to make eye contact and walk away when you are calling to them. Heard them arguing with a couple when they said their order was wrong, I know the guests were right b.c our order was wrong too, likely they mixed us up."}
{"text":"I didn't go in with any expectations and this place managed to fall below that level. I don't write negative reviews very often, but I just had to write one after my experience there tonight.  Staff: No one there to greet you or keep track of waiting customers. There is no place to wait and you stand there watching people eat. It's truly uncomfortable for everyone. Staff really didn't make eye contact at all. After waiting 15 minutes I noticed there were a couple of spots they could seat us, so I had to go up to the payment desk to ask to be seated. Once seated they did take our order pretty quickly but got it wrong.  Food: We ordered the Maki rolls (specifically Makinomo (?) - crispy version. I wish I had realized what it was before ordering. It was easily the worst sushi I've ever had. They basically combined the dry breadcrumbs used for tempura and put it into the roll. We couldn't even finish half of the order. We also had the basic sushi combo. The rolls were small, the fish was thinly sliced and definitely not fresh. I imagine that's the quality of sushi you get with AYCE.  Overall: Definitely won't be going back because the food was just so bad. The one redeeming quality is the food was cheap. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a one of my favourite places to eat, but after today I must say I am completely disappointed with the service. First, the waitresses kept handing us the wrong food. Honestly this wasn't a big deal for me because I'd waitressed before and I understand that sometimes it may be hard to remember which tables ordered this particular food. But the person I had the problem with the most was this oriental man, possibly the owner who was extremely rude and uncourteous. For one thing, when the waitress brought over our food we weren't sure what it was and so we asked the man. He goes and brings our order sheet back and says we ordered this. Okay yes thank you for telling us we ordered it, we wanted to know what it was because it was different from what we usually order. Second, while we were on our third round, this time getting desserts, this man bluntly asked if this is our last round. What I don't understand is why he kept coming to us. There were plenty of people he could annoy and we were doing nothing but trying to enjoy each others companies and eat our food. From my previous experiences, my friends and I would have 5 orders before leaving. So this was quite frustrating. Afterwards, he just puts our bill on the table, without asking if we're ready for our bill. He didn't even make it separate. Then, he comes over with my friends change and tells us all the tips go to the waitresses. So I don't know what he was implying...we refused to pay tips because in all fairness did they really even deserve any of our money? We barely had enough food and they kept missing some of our orders. Trust me saki sushi, you lost at least 20 people and  probably more because I will tell my friends and associates not to go to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Today is my son's 7th birthday and he loves sushi. So I took him to Saki Sushi in Mississauga. They advertise on their website www.sakisushi.ca that the birthday boy will be free with a minimum of 5 people. 5 of us went (3 adults 2 kids) and they said they no longer honour the birthday special. They ALSO do not honour their 3 other specials posted on their website. I told them that's false advertising and asked the manager to call the owner. Upon return, her proposed resolution is for me to pay the full price for my 4 year-old and then the birthday boy will be free!!?!?!? I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau already. To all those in Mississauga who wants sushi, PLEASE LET YOUR OTHER FRIENDS KNOW ABOUT THIS. If you also feel like having a conflict with anyone, I ask that you also go to their website and ask them for their Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday special. Needless to say, I will never return to Saki Sushi for ruining my son's birthday atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could rate this zero stars I would! Just got back from having AYCE dinner here and my experience was terrible. First, service was extremely and painfully slow. When looking around the restaurant, you could tell that no one dining there was pleased. Lots of people looking around..waiting for food...empty glasses, empty plates on the tables etc. It was BAD. Second, in addition to the slow service every single time we filled out a form to order anything, they would forget items completely. We tried to order sweet and sour chicken 3 times and it never came even after we asked about it. We gave up and finally asked for the bill..and it came to us 15 mins later. For a weekend dinner of $25.00 this place needs to get its shit together. The waitresses all looked lost and frantic and the kitchen seemed to be paying more attention to the take out customers than the customers who were dining. Do yourself a favour and skip this place because the food quality was nothing special either."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the new restaurant and its management. Quality sushi here folks and for a great price. Such an upgrade from UMI Sushi.   Best Sushi in the Square One / Mavis Area.  Thanks guys! see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the all you can eat deal. After a pleasant greeting, and once the order was in, the attitude changed to making us feel unwelcome and rushed. They frequently forgot things or brought them out without accompanying sides, like an order of chicken teriyaki and the rice order was forgotten and came 15 minutes later. By then, the chicken was cold. Vegetarian roll had chunks of shrimp and black, rotten avocado. Salmon was OK, about as good as grocery store selection."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else. Ive been here a few times. The food is fine. Prices are fine. But the owner and all of the servers really need a lesson in customer service. From the minute you walk in to the minute you leave, the servers are slow, they intrude by taking and replacing menus from your table to give to other tables mid-meal, reaching over and across the table without a word or acknowledgement to you or others at the table. I've waited an entire meal for my tea and water. The owner is just as bad ... just rude and dismissive."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on Bernie C's review.... for a new AYCE sushi joint, I was not disappointed by the quality of the restaurant.   Food: - Salmon sashimi was fresh and not too thinly sliced. Order up! - Regular rolls (ie. spicy salmon, dragon rolls)... the rolls were quite thick and heavy on the rice...PASS. Order specialty rolls instead! - Didn't get to try a lot of specialty rolls as the regular ones filled me up... I would definitely recommend Volcano Roll though! Very cheesy with salmon/crab meat and cream cheese deep fried in spicy mayo.... YUMMY! - Fried pork cutlet soba noodles (which were ramen and not really 'soba')... pretty good and not a huge portion either! - Menu quite extensive; dessert menu for example had sesame and red bean ice cream which a lot of other places don't have... deep fried banana and mousse cake slices were also bonuses!  Service: - There's a bell you could ring so that you don't have to constantly flag down the waiter... yay!  Price: - Adults are $13.99 lunch, $21.99 dinner + $1.00 Fri/Weekends/Holidays.... this seems to be pretty reasonable to go when you're super hungry on a non-holiday - I docked 1 star because I went on Christmas day and they charged dinner price for lunch ON TOP of the $1 holiday premium... (didn't expect them to charge dinner for lunch though). Even with 15% discount with cash, it was pretty expensive for lunch.  Consensus: Decent new AYCE in town to go when it's not a holiday or weekend... may be back to try again with a bigger party. Next time I might try the spicy salmon hand rolls that everyone else is raving about..."}
{"text":"-This place is in a great area (near Square One).  -One of the things that stands out for me here is the private cubicles/booths.  -The service was really fast and great. (No iPad ordering system but I don't mind traditional paper) -The rolls were a good size and had a lot of selection. We tried the pink lady roll and it was great because of the smoked salmon on top.  -The cooked dishes are actually surprisingly good. Most sushi restaurants have terrible cooked/wok dishes but here they were all great. The chicken wings were amazing!   All in all it was a great experience and was affordable. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Worst service ever (except Barry who really helped us). The restaurant closes at 10:30pm. We arrived at 9:50 and were left waiting at the door so that they could find out if the kitchen would be able to make us food. Barry was able to talk the kitchen and get us to order our food.   We were rushed beyond belief to order our food. I wanted to switch the sushi out of my bento box and the manager huffed and puffed in my face because he didn't want to switch anything. He ran back to the kitchen to find out if the kitchen could do it. He ran back to me and said there are no exceptions and he didn't care what kind of allergies I have. Unacceptable.   I was yelled at and two minutes after we ordered he ran back to our table with our bills ordering us to pay immediately. Been sitting here for 10 minutes and have not been offered a drink. Barry went to get us water and got yelled at in the back of the kitchen and we could all hear. That is also unacceptable.  Now for the icing on top of the cake. Let's remember that the restaurant's last call for food is 10pm and that the restaurant CLOSES AT 10:30. We received our food at 10:10.. Wrapped in take-out boxes. We were planning on enjoying our meal and sitting to eat. We were then asked to leave because the manager would be upset if we stayed.   This is the worst customer service I have ever ever ever experienced in my life. I never knew that something like this could ever happen to be honest with you. At the end of the night (at 10:30), we ended up taking our take-out bento boxes to a park and eating them on the bench in the park at 10:30 at night. Food was okay. I've had better but the whole time while eating I was thinking about the terrible service I received. I am extremely upset and have never left a restaurant feeling this way in my life.   If it isn't obvious, I would NEVER return or suggest that anyone ever spend a dime in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Damn good price, I even have a discount VIP card. Private booths are great, though not the best sushi. I did burn my mouth on a ball item that I didn't know was burning hot on the inside, still upset and I may have cried a bit."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. But the service is the absolute worst. For the service alone I would give them 1 star. The food always takes very long to come at least 45 minutes for each order and its a buffet; pretty ridiculous. Then when the food actually comes out they never get the order right, half of the stuff you ask for doesn't even come up and when you ask them where it is, they ask you to write it down again. The wait staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. They have a bad attitude and they never want to check anything for you. I actually liked the food here but I don't think I could come after the experience and this happens almost every time. I would recommend other sushi buffets who actually have good service and nice wait staff, these people are a joke they have no idea what customer service means. They will lose customers for that."}
{"text":"Food is passable for AYCE standards, selection is good, but sometimes they forget orders so you might have to ask again (we've had to ask like 5 times for one particular dish). The freshness of the fish is not very consistent; sometimes one type of fish is really good, another day it's not fresh, etc. They've served us rancid fish before."}
{"text":"Slow service. Had to ask 5 times for my bill to come. Half decent food. Server tries to correct me on an order my table did not order, and gave an attitude while doing so. I don't know how this place is still up and running but it's an overall bad experience and I would not even recommend it to my enemies"}
{"text":"Saki sushi is good value for your money.  Some AYCE places has too much rice with their sushi but saki sushi has a good balance.  Leave some room for desert!"}
{"text":"Went for an AYCE lunch on a weekday.  Restaurant is clean and tidy, only gripe is that there is a bunch of idiots who decided to write on the wood inside the booths which makes the place seem trashy when it really isn't.  The food was fresh, and the service was fast and polite.  This was the most polite staff I've experienced at an AYCE sushi place.    The tempura was perfect - had a variety of shrimp and veggies.  The rice in the sushi had a nice balance with good seasoning.  The fish was fresh and tasty -you could even see them filleting fresh fish when we paid our bill.  The rolls themselves were delicious - especially their special rolls that we picked.  Be careful with the Volcano Roll however, that thing is gigantic, but tasty (that's what she said..)  Overall a great experience and I will return.  Their take-out prices are among the cheapest I've seen so I'm sure I will try that as well eventually."}
{"text":"All in all very good sushi. The speciality rolls were good sizes.   My boyfriend and I went for AYCE dinner, which was fairly reasonable in pricing. Tip: Definitely hit up an ATM before, so you can get 15% off for using cash.  My only minor complaint is that the rolls weren't exactly rolled that tightly, causing a lot of broken rolls along the way.   Service - Quick and friendly. Environment - Clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Pho Mii 99 had a line up so we decided to try sushi for a change.  Fresh sashimi, tasty rolls, quick service.\"  Pink lady roll was good, as was the volcano roll.  Sushi pizza was ok although they were skimpy on the salmon and the rice cake was too thick.   They also have a nice assortment of dessert cakes other than the standard ice creams and deep fried banana."}
{"text":"I arrived at 21:20 for a late dinner (over an hour before closing) and my favourite rolls were never served in the end \"because the fryer is turned off.\" Extremely disappointed with the poor customer service, and the fact I was told this 35 minutes before the restaurant closes when the rolls were ordered upon arrival!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure why I've been reading about bad service..? I came here with my boyfriend and the food came so quick, and service was available immediately. The food is quite good aswell, we had no complaints. Price is fair. I would come again."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to eat deteriorated into a mere shadow of its former glory. I am sitting in the restaurant trying to not bawl my eyes out about paying. Beyond disappointed with food, service, and price; waste of time, calories, and money (tri factor x2). So unimpressed to the point where the whole meal, the only thing that was deemed somewhat satisfying was the siu mai. The sushi was terrible even by AYCE standards. Sashimi was luke warm and mushy. The dumpling was cold at first, and after asking for it to be heated up, it ended up disintegrating in the plate. The fried food was either stale and/or turning sour. Seaweed salad was fishy in smell and had a strange after taste. There were a plethora of issues that were long too list. Overall, I don't think I want to come back. On a lighter not they have a large dessert selection (update...most of said selection were unavailable...) and free bday dinner for 1 person in a group of 5, paid in cash. (Safe to say, hopefully this place will be a distant memory). Dear gawd...worst night ever, car broke down right outside too. Terrible night turned worse..."}
{"text":"This place got me to love katsudon, I previously didn't have it before. I'm not a sushi person so I wasn't sure what to order, but the katsudon tastes great!  Service was good too, 4 stars. The gyoza (although very tasty) was pretty sharp, it cut my sister... Be careful!!"}
{"text":"I finally came in for a 2nd visit a year and a half later and finally had their AYCE menu.      First thing I noticed: the smell...very fishy. I stayed despite that.    What I liked about this place:  #The SPIDER ROLLS! These were fantastic.  They were nice, crispy and used soft shell crab.  A lot of AYCE places, whether in the west end or east end, are either out of Spider rolls, or they are just crispy tempura rolls.   #Chicken wings - these were fried very well.  #Crispy rolls, and spicy salmon were also very good. #it's cheap.  For $13.88 on weekdays and $14.88 on weekends, it is one of the cheaper sushi buffets.  #good selection of desserts  What I didn't like: -no unagi during lunch :-( -the fish wasn't super fresh.  You can easily tell because the salmon sushi wasn't super pink.   -The servers seem to have very little understanding of English, though it wasn't too much of a barrier.  What was weird: -Arctic roll:  This weird concoction had spicy salmon, crab, avocado, eel sauce with tempura crisp wrapped in rice paper.  I'm still not sure if I liked this or hated it.  It was ummm..different.     Verdict:  Will re-visit since it's very good value and it's less than 2 km from where I live.  Better than Kanda, which is also less than 2 km from where I live."}
{"text":"I have tried their fish filled sushi a while ago but don't remember the service or food.  On Saturday i went in as a vegetarian and it was a better experience. Apparently they use to do ayce or only during certain hours. I'm happy with ala carte! Especially since their prices are amazing.  Had the veggie bento box:  Soup/Salad Veggie tempura/fried tofu/avocado roll/spring rolls/rice and teriyaki veggies = $12.99  Lots of food and most of it was delicious! The teriyaki veggies was the worst part... just cabbage and it was over cooked and salty... a little bit of other veggies would have helped a lot. It was basically what they served under the salmon teriyaki my friend got to soak up all the oil.  Service was okay, floor was mopped before closing time so it was super slippery leaving with no caution signs til the exit.  I would go back for some cheap rolls."}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times and the food was great but the service was okay, but after today I Dont want to go back, I've noticed many times they don't give you your full order (hoping you forget you ordered it) more than half our order was missing! And the service was incredibly terrible the would come to our table without letting us place another order and after twenty min of waiting they took our second order and half of that was missing! We ended up just asking for the bill and leaving extremely upset. That was my last time"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning on sat from the red dragon roll. Please someone send a health and safety inspector to this place :("}
{"text":"Shit service. Shit attention to detail.  I had to walk out, but paid my dues ... It was a simple lunch and not even crowded.  These guys will not be here in one year unless they replace their staff."}
{"text":"This was the worst Japanese experience in years.  The enoki beef rolls were made from very tough old beef, that was stringy and very hard to eat. The flavour was also bland. Even being sliced very thin, it was almost impossible to chew.  The salmon teriyaki came with two pieces. The first was in, but bland and hardly any teriyaki flavour/sauce. The second piece was that fishy quality of old or freezer burned salmon. Inedible.  The rainbow roll had a softish salmon that just barely ok, flavourless unagi, but the butter fish was off. Like rotten; sour, mealy, bad fishy, really rotten off. I almost threw up, and had to spit it out.  A third person got chicken teriyaki, and proclaimed it to be ok.  After the rotten fish, we finally complained.  They claimed the salmon was fresh and just pan fried. Refused to accept it was old. My wife has salmon teriyaki around once a month, and I cook it in other ways once or twice a month, so knows her fish. They also claimed that I may not be familiar with butter fish. I have butter fish at New Generation and Japango often.  They did not offer to comp anything on the bill and defended the obviously rotten food.  There were only  2 other tables eating while we were there and it should have been a clue. We chose this place based on yelp reviews, and proximity to the Living Arts Centre. Yelpers you really let us down, or you are used to a very inferior level of Japanese food."}
{"text":"Family dinner and the place have improved and new design and excellent service and great food and you need to try the soups it's great and they do take-out and it's 10% off :) . It's a great place for group party and kids so I high recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since I figured sushi is a pretty safe bet and consistent enough in taste. I ordered a bento box but it was not very flavourful. The beef was good but very oily which is why it was probably good.   To be honest, I will go to Fortinos or Superstore next time and get their ready made sushi since it is actually better than what I had here."}
{"text":"Saki sushi are one of the many sushi restaurants in Mississauga. One separates them from the rest? Well the cubicles that you are seated on, are beaten up by previous customers and vandalize most likely by students who has no sense of respect. It's not very eye pleasing and also looks disgusting and old.  Service was good thou. Polite, fast enough and no mistakes on orders. What more can you ask for? Possibly, better food? The sushi was not fresh but it wasn't bad either. But considering there are so many competition, they don't separate themselves with quality that's for sure. I don't remember one order that I said i have to go back for. Even the presentation was not pleasing. Remember this restaurant owners, food taste better when they look good.  Price are the same all around 15 for lunch and 23 for dinner. So can't comment on that. But if you are looking for a good sushi place to impress a date, skip this one. Will I go back? Maybe next year when i make my rounds of sushi restaurants again. They shall have another chance."}
{"text":"EDIT: This place no longer does AYCE sushi, and the waitresses are more surly than they were when I came here last. Also, the prices are borderline-ridiculous, go elsewhere if you want sushi.  I'd visited this place frequently up until a couple of years ago, and like previous reviewers have said, this place has changed a lot. I dined here on New Year's Eve, and I kind of regret not going somewhere else. There's no cash discount, and the AYCE food isn't as great as one would hope-- compared to Heart Sushi or Sushi 168, it's not great, but this place is a dollar or two cheaper. The best thing on the menu is their inari, and I think it's the only thing I'd come back for. The food isn't *bad,* it's just that there are better places to get AYCE.  Also, the owner is quite rude. The waitresses make an effort now, and they do genuinely treat guests politely, but the owner rushes you and basically throws your bill on the table when you're done. I thought it was absolutely obnoxious that he did that-- the only table he was nice to was a table of young women, and it seemed like he was flirting with them. I also noticed that on the bill, it said that our server was the manager when that wasn't the case. I have a feeling that tips aren't going where they're supposed to but I can't be sure obviously.  So yeah, the sushi isn't the worst but it's not the best, the owner isn't great, but I'd go back for the inari because they're the only restaurant I've been to in the GTA that makes them without using orange blossom water or something else to flavour the tofu."}
{"text":"i went for sushi today. everything was delicious. i guess the right sushi chef is really important.  Sashimi was fresh and taste great. i always order salmon and butter fish( some call white tuna).   roll are properly form, right amount of rice and content. basically all the rolls are good. i don't really like cream cheese inside the roll. so i will stay away from the rolls have cream cheese. my favorite roll is spicy dragon and snow dragon, yummy! ( but i wish for the spicy rolls, they can go easy on the spicy mayo, too much would kill the taste.   as for sushi, i love their spicy salmon and spicy tuna, it actually have chunks of fish in it , not just mushy,chop up fish. the texture was so much nicer.  highly recommend!  teriyaki  egg plane is a must try, really good. their cooked food is really good. i love the BBQ eel fried rice, i would go to this place for this dish alone. perfect seasoned,  a little bit sweet, soft rice and flavorful BBQ eel. hmm...must order. food i love it. service is ok , but today kinda slow, we had to  remind them of our orders, but waitress are friendly. i am not  picky about service as long as they are not rude i am ok.   the 2 positive experience i had were both on Tuesday, the negative one  was on Wednesday, i am assuming different chefs , i think i will only go on Tuesday.  if you like all you can eat sushi, definitely try out this one!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately upon entering and it was not too busy for a Saturday evening. The server gave our table one menu to look at when we had a party of three which was odd. The washrooms were clean although they did not seem to be serviced frequently as there were no toiletries in the stalls. Food was okay - I have had better AYCE sushi at other locations. Some of the sushi was made sloppy and fell apart before even lifting it. The spring rolls were oozing oil so I definitely would not recommend those. But the overall reason I have rated this place one star is because the service is horrible!! They are rude and give off too much negative energy to be working in a customer service role. I would not recommend this place even though their AYCE sushi is at a lower price point in comparison to other locations in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Good price and good food. Not the best ayce sushi but the service is quick, price is right, and food is still above par.  They have this deep fried sushi and it's amazing. I like the little booths they have. Keeps it cozy."}
{"text":"My friend and I used to go to Umi Sushi constantly before they closed, went under new management, and became Saki Sushi. A couple of things:  1. Service at both Umi and now Saki is consistent. They are FAST. I've eaten at many sushi places and find that the service is usually very quick, which is amazing because no one wants to wait forever for their food.   2. Shortly before Umi closed, the quality of their sushi began to change for the worse, making my friend and I hesitant to try the newly opened Saki Sushi. However, we took a look at their website and decided to give it a chance.   This brings us to the present.   WOW! No word of a lie when I say their food is AMAZING! The fish is FRESH; seaweed crispy, seaweed salad cool and delicious, and their salmon pieces are to die for! Whether it's sashimi or the spicy salmon/crisp rolls, their salmon was unbelievable. Every time I've had the spicy salmon elsewhere, it's just never been right, and the pieces were usually too small. Here, however, they were gratuitous, large, and epically flavourful.   The lunch and dinner menu is AYCE, and we went for lunch. Their price is a reasonable $13 or so plus tax, and you get 10% off if you pay cash.   If you were debating on whether or not to go, don't deny yourself the opportunity! You'll love it."}
{"text":"A great spot for all you can eat sushi. This being said, there are better sushi joints, but this one has to be one of the best in the all you can eat sushi category. This place has great service and a great menu with many options to please any sushi lover. If your in the area and have sushi fever, choose this joint and you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"I have also been going to Saki since before it was Saki. UMI really did go down the drain. Saki is better, also the employees are much nicer and they speak English. The rolls are tasty, they don't have a lot of choice besides sushi. But i like this place a lot and there fried rice is good too."}
{"text":"I worked there before. In the back kitchen, The Korean boss always put back used Wasabi to new customers dishes. Their environment is terrible. I won't go this place for a meal. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"when umi packed up and left I was so effin happy cause I've been living in the hood for so many years...their rude service and sub-par fish was prob one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. I guess they finally realized they shouldn't be in the resto biz. anyway I thought Id give this new place a shot cause you know new beginnings are always good thing. when we first walked in the waitress greeted us with a friendly welcome. BAM!!!  wow this place is already 10 times better than umi ever was and I haven't even sat down yet. anyway, The fish was pretty good here. they have a big selection of rolls. pretty much every major city in north America. you got the boston roll, phily roll, etc etc. I thought it was bit pricy for a new AYCE joint. for two, our bill came to around $55.i really don't think they should charge for tea but whatever... its nice to see more AYCE sushi popping up in Mississauga. good luck to the new owners of Saki. keep up the good service. it goes a long way,"}
{"text":"Had sushi with a friend here for dinner on Saturday evening. We chose this place out of close proximity. We arrived and asked for a hut (they have booths that resemble little huts and have more privacy). The waitress tells me they have no more huts available, as I stare at two empty ones - umm, ok. They seat us at a table which is all sticky. We tell them and she moves us to the next table - just as sticky as the last one. At this point I give up and lose my appetite a bit.   You order off a paper checklist which the waitress takes. They brought food and after waiting for awhile we had to flag down one of the waitresses to get soya sauce. We ordered a bunch of things off the menu, a few of the items never made it to our table.  They have a doorbell in every booth that you can press whenever you need something - we definitely made use of it as the service at this place was terrible! Our waitress had the worst look of misery on her face and no customer service skills whatsoever. She looked like she was in sheer agony any time we needed something or asked a question.   Be aware - the bill came and they added a $2 charge per person for \"holiday/weekend\". I was extremely hesitant on leaving any tip at this point, but gave in nonetheless.  The only reason this place is getting a 2-star instead of a 1-star is because the food overall was okay, mediocre sushi. Everything else was terrible! I would not recommend this spot."}
{"text":"It has been 3 years since I last went here, so what's changed? Well, there's no cash discount any more it seems. Aside from that, I've noticed some of the food is hit and miss. Maybe I just didn't order the misses before.  Hits:  Anything with spicy salmon in it, especially the spicy salmon sushi. Yum. Chicken wings Seaweed salad Avocado salad Beijing Roll - It's got banana in it! It works somehow Sashimi - decently fresh   Misses:  Tempura - they use really nasty watered down tempura sauce Red dragon roll - I wonder what knife they used to cut that extremely thin sliver of salmon they placed on top of the roll Saki shrimp - by far the worst order of the night. None of the batter actually had any shrimp in it that we could see. Not only that, but one portion actually has a good number of this shrimpless batter. Enoki mushroom beef roll roll - Usually this dish is good, but not at this place Edamame - It was mostly good but some of them had unusual black spots on them. Still cautiously waiting for the stomach ache. Squid ball - 99% batter, 1% squid. Like takoyaki without the condiments on top.  Overall, the food is just okay, but that's expected considering it's cheaper than other AYCE spots in the city. The service is pretty quick and I didn't really find them to be rude despite what a lot of comments here are saying. They're not friendly, sure, but rude is a strong word."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted horrible. We ordered from the non ayce menu hoping the rolls would taste better, what a joke. The waitress was rude and never apologized when one of our order never came. We will never come back here again. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I'm giving Saki Sushi a 3.5/5.  I'm assuming Saki Sushi just opened recently because if you pay by cash you'll get 15% off your bill. Weekend prices are at a reasonable price of $14.88..and $1 less on weekdays. Sashimi and drinks aren't included in the cost though.  There weren't many customers during lunch time so our orders came out pretty quickly. Everything tasted great minus the green salad (which was soaked in dressing), coconut mousse, and the lychee jello. The rolls are a good size, not too big and not too small. However, some of the rolls kept falling apart.  Each table and booth has a bell that you can press so that the waiter/waitress can come to you right away. Our bell was dirty so we used the pencil to press it.  Overall, it's a good AYCE sushi restaurant at a decent price on a weekend."}
{"text":"Seeing that Yelp gives 4 stars for this AYCE sushi place, I thought we'd give it a try! Thanks Yelp for taking me here!  My boyfriend (a Mississauga citizen) has been to this exact location before, many many times. It just wasn't Saki Sushi then. But not much changed except for the wall color, the name of this restaurant... and also the price -but the decor and furniture is exactly the same!   It's $21.88 for dinner ($13.88 for lunch). On Fridays, weekends, and holidays, it's just +$1. Which is great right? Typically it'd be around $25.  So we were here on a Friday evening 7pm, the place was NOT packed (phew!). For some reason they wouldn't let people sit in the booths. I was watching the waitress explain to a nice couple for a good 5 minutes about it, but in the end they let the couple sit in the booth anyway. ????  There is a button you can press, it will ring (loudly! LOL) and display your table number in the back. I swear we were the only table doing this that evening.....  GREAT SUSHI! You know what was the most interesting? SEAWEED SUSHI. Are you serious!? Seaweed sushi and seaweed handroll. This isn't new or anything.... but I usually don't see this on the menu. Anyways we loved it!  They have some interesting rolls here (under Saki Special Rolls), but I didn't like any of them... they taste exactly what the ingredients say -they don't even go well together. I must mention this one though: - Volcano Roll (4pc) cream cheese, salmon, white tuna, wrapped seaweed deep fried with house special sauce (DO NOT order this for TWO people, CREAM CHEESE + SALMON!? Extremely filling!)  The spider roll was really good!  Sashimi was fresh, sushi was pretty good. The udon soup was nice, but aside from that, it was pretty lame... a BUNCH of onions and carrots and other veggies, that's too much random stuff for udon!!  I would give it 4 stars. We ate a lot here! And we just kept ordering.. and we kept ordering because the SERVICE was terrible!!!   Firstly, they got my order wrong from the PAPER order. We thought, ah well they make mistakes. Later we wanted to add a small order so instead of wasting the paper, we waved the waitress down to tell her. The wrong dish comes. We asked for a replacement...  Then later, we ordered more on paper (I thought alright, you shouldn't get this wrong since this is written. How about I circle all my orders too so you don't miss them like our previous ones?). They got it wrong again! So we sent another paper order... it's all you can eat, right? WRONG AGAIN!!  And then she said, \"Oh did you mean THIS? It's right here, and it's not this one.\" Yes and that's what I wrote!!  Honestly, I am very forgiving but I mostly didn't like that the waitresses were ignoring us as well. The place wasn't even busy, they were just walking fast and ignoring my waving arm. SLOW DOWN! I have a feeling they didn't like me putting so many orders (it's their fault for getting it wrong!) One of them stayed in the back to chat with the sushi chefs most of the time.  3 stars. There you go.   I agree with Kimberly N. that the seaweed salad was soaked in dressing."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family on Sunday. We went with their AYCE menu. Definitely worth it.   It looked like we were the first to arrive so lucky us. Our server was very friendly and when the food came, she introduced every plate which was a great touch especially if you didn't know what your order looked like. Only issue we had was that there was a small piece of plastic in the Avocado Salad my mom ordered. She quickly made it known to our server and our server immediately said sorry and offered a replacement. Everything else we ordered was great. We got everything we ordered. I especially loved their Spider Roll.  We did not meet the owner whom alot of these current reviews complain about (Thank God)  I did however see that our server was training a new server which was great to see because I overheard our server tell the new one to always be friendly and courteous to guests.  I don't know if these guys read the reviews here or not but they do look like they are trying to better themselves. (I can't speak for the owner since we did not see him)  So it's a solid 4 stars for the service and food. Minor hiccup involving the Avocado Salad aside, you can't fault anyone to puts an effort in trying to better themselves."}
