{"text":"great sushi place here in Georgetown. like previous poster, it is a hit or miss on the service and quality but in most cases for me its been great.  dinner menu has more options. service on the ball pretty quick.  friday and saturday nights you may have some trouble parking, no spaces.  spider roll is a must! takes a bit longer to make but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Decent food but a lot is very greasy.  Service is hit or miss tonight it seemed like the wait staff was at a funeral.  It seemed a lot better when it first opened but has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the sushi.  Friendly staff bumps this rating up to two stars. The sushi is a bit sweet and is over 'sauced'.  I lived on the west coast for some time so I was exposed to really good and fresh sushi.  Really good sushi is a combination of fresh ingredients that are layered together creating amazing flavours.  Sushi at Kyoto is a combination of ingredients that are over sauced and sweet."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with HORRIBLE service! The waitresses wouldn't come by the table and the food was incredibly slow to come out of the kitchen, and it wasn't a 'packed house'!!  Will not return!"}
{"text":"Service is good. They are very quiet and not overly helpful in explaining the menu (this is likely a language barrier) but they are polite, efficient, and it's rare that ordered items are missing. If they do miss one just let them know and they bring it quickly.  Food is not great but definitely good.   Sushi has been consistently good.  Sashimi is hit or miss depending on who the sashimi chef is that day. Some days the sashimi is sliced very well and other days it is sloppy and cut incorrectly.   Fried food are done well and not greasy.  Dipping sauce options are limited. Teriyaki steak and salmon are excellent.  Stir fry and noodle options are ok but the flavours are very repetitive in many of the dishes.   Menu is fairly extensive and there is choice for everyone.   Prices are fair and the atmosphere is quaint and clean."}
{"text":"I have tried sushi in literally every corner of the GTA and I can confidently say that this is the best sushi place of the all.  There's lots of options. The sushi is very fresh  The service is fast The place is nice and clean  5 stars"}
{"text":"When I moved to Georgetown I was fully aware that I wouldn't be entering an epicure's paradise. But I've actually been pleasantly surprised by some of the restaurants here. Unfortunately, Kyoto Sushi isn't one of them.  The food left a lot to be desired. The sashimi was alright, not mind blowing but certainly not bad. The maki are way too big to eat, and if you take a bite to try to break it in two, it falls apart. The appetizers were also decent, but anything that was fried had the aftertaste of old oil.  What did surprise me was the service. I'm used to being forgotten about, not getting my orders, and having to re-order or just deal with it. Not the case here. They're old school and don't use those stupid iPad apps that crash all the time and it shows. Staff are nice and pleasant. Perhaps the craziest thing is that pop costs $1. In an age of four dollar sodas, that's refreshing.  So to summarize: nice decor, friendly staff, good service, but they can't overcome the lack of quality and care in the food preparation. Perhaps it's gone down a bit since some of the really enthusiastic reviews were posted here.  If you're looking for sushi in Georgetown, try Yo Yo on the east end. It's not all you can eat, but the portions are more than adequate and the difference in quality is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food- many options to choose from between sushi and other cooked/fried foods.   The menu unfortunately doesn't give a description of what some of the rolls entail (such as the hockey roll or snow roll).   The tempura is kind of gross, oil tastes old and its tasteless over cooked, but that's the only thing I've tried and didn't enjoy here.   Great if you're a vegetarian or vegan as they have close to 7 veggie maki options alone!   The service is quiet and comes and goes when needed; sometimes drink refills take time but they get there.   Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Staff are soulless. Not polite. Instead of Kyotos go to Yoyo's for a much more authentic experience and better quality sushi."}
{"text":"Visited sat for lunch. Not bad. Some servers seem miserable but some others are friendly.  The place always seems busy. Not bad for the price weekend lunch 15.99.  We have eaten here before and seen yo like it."}
{"text":"Was at Kyoto on Labour Day and was very disappointed. We sat by the entrance for over 10 minutes without any acknowledgement whatsoever. Then another  couple entered the restaurant  and they were seated first. I believe the restaurant is under new ownership and service is not priority. Add to that the price just increased.  I have been  a weekly patron at this restaurant for over 3 years ... and sadly today will be my last."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and compared to other AYCE this place is by far the best one I have been to. The service is fine and the food is actually fairly good again compared to many other AYCE places. They are the only place that serves squid tentacles my absolute favourite. The price point is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is not good... The sushi options are mediocre at best. The salmon tastes old,  the surf claim and snapper feels as if they have been frozen and thawed. Their spicy tuna and salmon were very disappointing,  they just mix the fish with fried batter and some spicy sauce making it taste really greasy.  The kitchen food is also very greasy.  It is difficult to speak to some of the staff since not many speak English very well."}
{"text":"It is tough for me to rate Kyoto Sushi, because I only know the standard of Japanese AYCE in Toronto and Markham/RH; I have no knowledge to judge the relative quality of Kyoto when compared to other AYCEs in Georgetown.  Having said that, if you reside in or near Georgetown, please rest assured that Kyoto stakes up against its Toronto rivalries nicely.    Selection: For sushi, sashimi and maki, average, as in not less than, when compared against Toronto's AYCEs.  For cooked items, the selection is quite a bit fewer than Toronto's AYCEs.  Quality: Sashimi and maki are very fresh and well made (especially the sashimi).  Sushi is a thin slice of fish over a big lump of rice.  It fares lower than good AYCEs in Toronto, but it fares average against the average AYCEs in Toronto.  For the few cooked items we ordered, their quality was on par with Toronto's AYCEs.  Services: It was very good: Polite servers.  Quick food delivery.  No missed orders.  Frequent water and tea refills.  Prompt removal of empty plates.  This level of services will be ranked very good in any AYCE in Toronto.  Decoration:  Contemporary, spacious and clean.  The standard is at par with most Toronto AYCEs.  Kyoto Sushi is a solid AYCE on my book, even if it were located in Toronto.  3 stars for food and venue; 3.5 stars for overall as the services is excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's small, not overcrowded on weekdays, it's fresh, and the price is right. The menu options allows those who are new to the world of sushi, to choose cooked items. The staff is ok, not too friendly, but they do their job. I go here for the food, not the staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food, however the service is terrible. They don't speak fluent English and are very rude."}
