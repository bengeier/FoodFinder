{"text":"Shop N Go is like the heart of neighborhood. Go in any morning and it will be filled with neighbors chatting over coffee and breakfast before heading off to the grind. Tuesday's in the summer they do a great burger special for under $4 that includes fries and a drink. Cheaper than a fast food joint and the food is fresh. Friday's they have jumbo fish sandwiches, hands down one of the best in the area. They offer both frozen and fresh fries which is great because I hate frozen fries. The menu rotates a bit from week to week so for someone like me that stops in regularly, it really prevents monotony.

Love the staff, the girls are all great to me, and the owners seems like good people. 

Not a fan of the gyro or crab cake but I grew up north of Baltimore working in Greek restaurants so my standards may be too high. I like most of the rest of the menu. It's not high end at all, but it's good and comforting and served to you warmly by polite staff. They make pretty damn good pepperoni and breakfast rolls, give one a try.

Additionally, they carry a lot of household and dollar store items for convenience, as well as an old school bulletin board where you can find all sorts local services and events."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20 years. The deli meats are always fresh and delicious. I love the bread they use for the sandwiches. Not to mention they always have great little snacks, cookies, donuts and pastries for only a few bucks that go great with your morning coffee."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Surprisingly good made to order hot foods and sandwiches along with a good deli and random groceries.  Feels more like places used to when I was growing up."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this place. I don't care what time of day, or what day it is it's amazing. First when you walk in it doesn't matter who is working you get treated like family. This in and of itself is a huge selling point for me. I don't go anywhere near often enough for them to know or even remember me. Yet, every time we walk in it's always the same. Second their food is out of this world good! Tonight I got the pot roast dinner special. It had a ton of meat, and I got to pick between the mashed potatoes and homemade french fries. They gave me a nice taste of summer during this colder weather. They taste just like the Potato Patch fries at Kennywood! I ate until full and still have enough for dinner tomorrow. All this was $9. My dinner partner had the warm corned beef sandwich. The bread was a nice big piece, and the amount of meat on it was unbelievable! He also said it was awesome and he really enjoyed it. Let me again just touch back on the service. The workers are always great, and tonight was no exception. Except the woman who waited on us tonight was even nicer and we had a great conversation while waiting for the food.  They have booths to eat in or you and get it to go, and the prices are great! I know we paid for all our food, but it was so cheap I felt like we were given one for free. Everything you are doing is exactly right, please don't change it! You have a loyal customer for as long as you remain serving food. Thanks again for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Dia-mond-in-the- ROUGH!  Me being the the first review is still blowing my mind.  

This place is a convenience store/deli/restaurant in one.  The people and vibe of the workers and customers make it feel like a truck stop, and in some ways along this busy road, that's what it serves as.  They have lots to offer but why you come here is for food, daily home made home cooked style, meals.

Of anything I could recommend to you, it would be The Potato Salad.  I've bought tubs of this for parties and every time people ask where I bought it, even people who don't usually eat that.  It's the only place you're going to eat this because it's their recipe again, made daily.  Now, I know you're not gonna go out of your way for potato salad so luckily for you, they got hoagies, crab cakes, bacon wrapped deep fried hot dogs, fresh made subs, killer cheeseburgers and breakfast made fresh any time of the day.

This place also harbors a car wash next to it, both manual you do it car washes with vacuums and the lazy persons drive through kind.  So I suggest taking a ride here on a nice day, clean out your car and grab lunch.

{"text":"A great place to eat!! Homemade stuff from scratch. The employees are just a delight!! They make you feel like your part of a \"family\". The food is always good. We've never been disappointed with anything we've ordered and they are fast. I highly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"You would never guess it, but this place has the best food. I've never had anything bad here. My favorites are the ham BBQ, the ham cheese (those two I won't get anywhere else), and the chicken patty. Service is always really nice, to go or if you're gonna dine in. They also have a dollar store section that has a bunch of random stuff for cheap, that you never know you needed! When I am in the mood, I'll go here like 3-4 times in a week"}
{"text":"Great service and very kind people. I have never had anything bad to eat there and eat approximately 2 times a week throughout the summer"}
{"text":"While most of their food is good, and the fried bologna sub and the meatloaf subs are excellent, what I am reviewing is the food I had yesterday.

their special was pulled pork, roasted potatoes, green beans and a roll.  I got the food to go, as I work nearby.

#1 on the bad list, they forgot the roll.  Luckily, I had a couple of buns at work.  upon opening the container, the potatoes were greasy looking, a weird shade of brown, and the top layer of potatoes were very rubbery, what was underneath was not much better.  Greasy witha  strange taste.  The green beans were horrendous, soggy, slimey, mushy, one bite was all I could stand.

on to the pulled pork.  Was given a very measly little portion.  It was bland and stringy. 

All in all, I WILL NOT order this if they ever have it again.  this is not the first time the beans have been horrible, it is almost every time they have them.

I will, in the future, stick to the known good, and not venture into the realm of the unknown, special-wise.

they have had significant personnel turnover in recent months, and it shows, slow service, food quality has slipped."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in West Mifflin hands down. Great prices and great food (except the tuna salad) ... Daily specials are always good and a nice place to sit down and eat."}
