{"text":"This has the feel of a diner and it's exceptionally huge. There was an issue w my order and they handled it perfectly. We're visiting from Denver and we will go back to Perks for breakfast."}
{"text":"french toast was good and the scramble was good but overall it was good but nothing to tweet about, wait staff was friendly but get here early it gets packed"}
{"text":"Super friendly owners, fast service and delicious food.  Try the Chicken on the Coup!"}
{"text":"I have traveled all over the US with my service dog by my side and never have I ever been so offended.  The manager was just downright rude to me and I had no choice but to leave.  I would never go back or give them any support and neither should anyone reading this."}
{"text":"My hubby LOVES this place!  We just moved into the area and were looking for a close breakfast place.  The food it good (not 100% to my liking but that's just my taste buds).  The staff is very friendly and they have a few tables outside for when the weather is nice.  Inside is a large, high-ceiling one-room restaurant.  It's clean and consistent.  Again, don't let my taste buds defer you from trying this place out."}
{"text":"The owners, food and service are always fabulous!  Very reasonable prices. Great ingredients. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service is very friendly.  A bit tucked away in a strip mall,  but well worth seeking it out."}
{"text":"It seems to me that that people rating this place have never been to a hole in the wall beakfast joint! There is SO much hype behind this place that, for me(&probably the food network), it was a disappointment.  NOTHING about the taste of their food stood out to me. Their pricing is outrageous! $4.79 for 2 pieces of sourdough toast?! I have been to a handful of breakfast establishments with better seating, more room, less wait times, better customer service, as good of tasting food and much better pricing.   I still have a headache trying to figure out the hype behind this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is great and the place is inviting!"}
{"text":"Second Triple D spot on this trip and the second breakfast at Perk. Had an awesome Sonoma omelet both days and my wife had the waffles which were just as good. Fast friendly service and very reasonable prices, next trip out we will be back to Perk."}
{"text":"Great fast service here! My coworker and I stopped in here for our lunch hour and were happily surprised to be seated immediately. We explained to our server Barry that we had limited time and had to get back to work, put in our order, and before we could get to deep in conversation, our food had already arrived. Barry was friendly and was even great about getting us our check right away so that we could get back to work on time.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I found this place to be pretty meh.  Food: I ordered badly and that shouldn't reflect on the restaurant. (I ordered french toast with brie and I dislike brie) But I had everyone else at the table try my dish, and all agreed that the brie in the toast was a cold lump, unsweetened, and just generally bad. Everything else was pretty good. Breakfast enchiladas were excellent.  Atmosphere: Like a more expensive Einstein's or Panera. Very busy, not great service.   Overall, not a bad place, but there are better places for breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and i are always searching for great breakfast spots. These guys have the best pancakes in town, light and fluffy. Can't help but rave about their rosemary potatoes and their very tasty cilantro jalepeno sauce.My husband , the egg lover , has raved everytime he has ordered   something different on their menu.Especially like that their food is made with natural ingredients.  Service is very attentive"}
{"text":"Saw this place DDD and happened to be in the area so gave it a try and man was it Really, Really Good! I had the Wine Country French Toast and the Chicken on the Coupe and what awesome flavor's! Definitely homemade and not from a can. Highly recommended people to check it out. I will for eat here again there so much more I want to try. Also the wait staff was superbly friendly."}
{"text":"Long overdue writing a review of my favorite local breakfast place!  Ingredients are fresh and menu is pretty diverse.  Big fan of the Lozoya sandwich for lunch and the Carmelized banana pancakes for breakfast!    Good to see them getting recognition from Phoenix Mag and the Food Network"}
{"text":"Really good food and the service is great. I normally have the breakfast enchiladas which is my favorite dish here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the past, just went with my family for the first time.   Was told after I received my order and had asked for something else \"that I had ordered that\". Waiter walks away. Charged for it and nothing was address.   Such an embarrassing situation I will never be going back."}
{"text":"You know, we have supported this place from day one.  We have gone there when NO ONE went there.  We actually didn't think it would stay open, so we kept going hoping it would make it.  Well, we actually went there this past weekend after having very mediocre service and food for the past couple of visits.  It was packed and the place appeared still be doing great.  When our food came it was good but our 8 year old dropped his toast.  We asked if he could get another piece and the waiter said \"sure\".  Well, when the owner saw this she refused.  She wouldn't even allow the waiter to get him a single piece of bread without paying for a full order or toast.  The waiter was even stunned she was so rude about it.  ???  Are you kidding me?  When my wife asked her why she couldn't just let the waiter get a single piece of toast, she just blew off my wife.  We just spent $60 for breakfast and she couldn't get our kid a single piece of bread without paying for a full order.    I think the egos of these owners are getting out of control. We have 2 other friends who have had similar experiences with different issues.  Too bad that success has driven such arrogance.  We won't be back...ever."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place last spring when we were in Arizona for business and boy are we glad we did!  The interior is adorable and very diner-esque.  The french toast is divine. Scrambled eggs with brie and spinach sounds gross but tastes great.  I can't remember now what else we had but it was one of our more memorable breakfast meals in that week."}
{"text":"We had the waffles, and they were delicious with the caramel banana topping! We also had the potato pancakes, and they were decent. I wish they were a little more crispy.  Our waitress split the bill before we even had to ask, which was nice. But she never asked if we wanted to order anything more. We were a bit hungry and were thinking of ordering more.  They need more vegetarian lunch options.  All in all, it was pretty good. We might return if we are in the mood for brunch with friends."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and as usual searching for a new place for breakfast.  I get to the area often and always looking for something different.  I pulled up about 11 AM to this place at the end of a strip center. They weren't very busy, only a few tables. Upon arrival I was promptly greeted and shown to a table. It basically looked like a diner on one side but they had a bar on the other.  Why they have a bar when they are closed after 3 PM is beyond me.  I had their version of Huevos Rancheros.  A little different as they served me a quesadilla made with a corn tortilla and it was stuffed with chorizo, black beans, and cheddar cheese.  The eggs were placed on top and then smothered with what was described as jalapeño salsa. It was served with a hefty portion of Rosemary potatoes. Service was great but they weren't busy either.  Food appeared freshly made and served as ordered. I was graciously thanked on my way out.  I've had better, but everything was solid. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and it was great   1. Big plates of food  2. Fair prices  3. Good service   We had breakfast and got seated quickly, food was good for the price. It was a nice for a breakfast spot and the Mediterranean omelet was ok. Pancakes were tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go if you really want a tasty,healthy and affordable breakfast...their fresh ingredients are the best...the CILANTRO JALAPENO SAUCE is the BOMB...this is PERKFect place...."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get breakfast (and they have good lunch items!). Very simple menu with delicious items! My family and I go here at least once a week. The owners always great us with a smile and a handshake. The workers are friendly and service is always excellent. Definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Small wait time on a Saturday morning but worth the wait, nice atmosphere and friendly service. Would certainly go there again when in the area good portions a little on the high price side."}
{"text":"We have been coming on and off for the last few years. You are greeted promptly and the wait time for a table depending upon the day of the week varies but usually no longer than 10-15 minutes on a busy day.   Food quality and taste is consistent. If you like brie and wine, the one item on the menu to try is the \"wine country french toast\". Of course, many of the items on the menu are worth trying as well. Oh, yeah, good size crispy bacon too for all you bacon lovers out there.   The staff are courteous and you never really have to ask for refills or chase someone. It's like they are reading your mind.  So if you are looking for something out of the ordinary than your typical burger and breakfast joint, you may be pleasantly surprised after your visit.   Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Always fresh and great food with tremendous service. Everyone makes you feel like you are a valued customer. I try to make this my breakfast spot a couple times per month. The only thing that prevents this place from getting 5 stars is that they dont take American Express. Come on! In Scottsdale, AZ? You don't take the world's most prestigious card?"}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times for breakfast and am never disappointed by the food! The breakfast potatoes are cooked perfectly and the omelets are full of flavor! Will definitely continue to go."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding! Saw this on the diners drive ins show so of course I had to try it.  We had the pumpkin walnut pancakes, the red wine French toast and the western omelet.  All of it was delicious! I especially loved the pancakes.  The service was awesome the owner came out and chatted with us and was so friendly.  Our server as well was very knowledgable and gave great service.  It's definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Great food.  All three of us enjoyed our meals.  Wasn't healthy but was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, mostly because it is not crowded and noisy like the other breakfast places. Today, I am sure will be my last.  The food is fine..nothing special but the service was very lacking.  To begin with it is your basic breakfast/lunch menu but the prices are quite a bit high for what is given.  When our bill came I was outraged to see upcharges on almost everything.  I guess you eat exactly what states on the menu because to add or remove anything plus any condiments are extra.  We were charged quite a bit more without being informed that there would be extra fees for any of it.  When I inquired with the manager, she began to argue with me that the computer does not have a button for removing cheese from an omelette, etc.  Therefore, that is where the extra charges came from and it is not policy to have the waitress inform the customer of the fees. Well, lucky for me there are plenty of places in the valley that serve breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning and sat at the bar counter to watch football on the one TV there. My Bloody Mary was good but not overly impressive. The outlaw scramble was delicious, and I really like the jalapeño cilantro salsa topping. Service was good, and the atmosphere was nice and calm. I'll be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"My first time here was okay. Waited an hour for my food because they had a glitch in their computer system. It was unfortunate because I had to sit there watching everyone that came in after me eat their meals. I ordered the corn beef hash it was good but way too many potatoes! 3/4 of my plate was all potatoes.. I call that potato overload!!"}
{"text":"Staying over the The Westin Villas and looking for a non-hotel place for breakfast.  My fellow yelpers never let me down!  Perk was about a 2 minute drive (really, we should have walked), located in a strip mall.  It's a little place, but we were seated right away.  There appeared to be lots of locals milling about.  Ordered the banana, caramel walnut pancakes, and the hubby ordered the same by in the waffle.  Felt almost guilty as it was like eating dessert for breakfast.  Totally hit the spot!  I rarely give a 5 star review but consider this one a 4 1/2.  Would return again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Busy but didn't take long for table. Excellent corn beef hash!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for Father's Day breakfast only to find the prices jacked up 20% and a limited menu.  Needless to say we walked out. We are locals and don't appreciate being taken advantage of. #greed"}
{"text":"Great addition to area - which is missing good breakfast options. The brie, turkey, fig, egg combination was yummy and the Pete's steak sandwich was definately worth a return trip..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Saturday morning.   It took our server 30 minutes to acknowledge us.  It continued to go downhill. My husband ordered a tortilla and they brought him white toast.  I ordered rye toast and was brought wheat.  We ordered a pumpkin pancake on the side and brought a regular one.  We finished our meal and about 10 minutes later the pumpkin pancake appeared.  The rest of the food we ordered was good, but how do you mess up eggs and bacon? No apology, nothing was said!  Finally, our bill came and we were overcharged for the pancake.  The service was terrible!!"}
{"text":"Waiters are very personable and take the time to make sure all your needs are meet. By the time you are ready to leave, they charmed their way to a 20% tip. Food is pricey considering the quantity but you pay for the service and a well thought out, simple menu."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite breakfast stop for the wifey and I for sometime now. Quality and consistency are the two words that come to mind when describing The Perk.  You really can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu...pancakes are fantastic, omeletes are outstanding, breakfast potatoes, their toast, organic coffee, etc...all several notices above typical breakfast fare.  Service has always been solid as well. You can tell the owners take a lot of pride in what they do by their attention to detail - can't recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this gem of a breakfast spot.  l had the Fancy Pants scramble with spinach, onion, garlic, turkey, brie, and fig compote and it was decadently delicious. My daughter had the breakfast burrito and the menu allows you to pick what you want inside which is great for youngsters. Other daughter had silver dollar pancakes and rediscovered her love of bacon at the same time. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  This place actually serves a big omelet.  Why is it so hard to find a big omelet??  These places that specialize in breakfast, and give you a tiny, flat, skimpy omelet??  Why??  Anyways, I digress...  The eggs are perfectly cooked... and generous, very good rosemary potatoes, and great coffee.  Excellent, excellent service!  Fair prices.  Very clean!!  A gem for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I ate at Perk this morning with my Husband and my Father.  Safe to say we each gave our breakfasts a 5 star rating. Service is always awesome when I go, as it is always nice to see the same smiling faces every time I go in. I had the special of the day which happened to be the bacon breakfast tacos that are not on the menu. My only suggestion is to put that on the every day menu."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday at 8:00 and was seated quickly. My husband and I ordered the chicken in a coup. It is sage dressing with pepper sausage gravy with eggs on top. It was okay not spectacular for the price. Coffee was good."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this breakfast joint since they first opened because it is right in our neighborhood. It has been nice watching their success as they have expanded their location to add more seating areas, a community table, and bar (yes, that means they serve alcohol and their drink menu is very fun!). Obviously business is good.    I only have breakfast when I come here (even if it is 12 noon) and my weakness are their pancakes. I'm not even a big pancake eater but these are the best!!! Will usually order them with the egg and bacon combo.  Their bacon is nice and thick and they give you real maple syrup for your pancakes. Love their Mediterranean omelette too. Quality of food is good and my kids love it as well.  My son likes the Chicken on the Coupe (as featured on DDD) and my daughter is a fan of their Dollar Pancakes off the Kids Menu and their Breakfast Burrito.  As with all newer breakfast places these days it seems kind of pricey. Place gets busy on the weekends and the waiting area could be better (majority of waiting area is outside).  Overall we keep coming back.  We like supporting businesses in our community and I need my pancake fix."}
{"text":"Decent prices.  $21 for 2 huge sandwiches.  felt like boa constrictors as we left.  Reuben sandwich was good on terrific rye.  Fries excellent!  Mucho smoocho ( yep, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese & special sauce --- it's that kind of place) good, but over-the-moon great.  No wait on a Friday afternoon.  Clearly a family operation -- grandma, teenagers & all.  Nice  change from endless chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"No vegetarian friendly options...not even fresh avocado. Good rosemary potatoes though!"}
{"text":"We have been here 2 times, as we just found it a few weeks ago!  Excellent pancakes and I tried the corned beef hash today, and it was incredible.  It was perfectly cooked and had fresh rosemary as a nice top garnish and Swiss cheese.  Impeccable wait staff, clean and a nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  My son and I during his Spring Break out for a mom/son date thought we would try Perk.  We had a 10 minute wait just to be seated outside right at the door.  We waiting for 10 minutes and were never acknowledged...I finally flagged another waiter to help.  No one wanted to claim our table.  So we finally got drinks and ordered...well 40 minutes later we finally got our food.  It wasn't that great.  When you have to beg for service it's not a good choice. Otherwise...the sign should say self serve.  As another Yelper stated...the wait staff was clueless of what they were doing.  Too bad since we are new to the neighborhood...this could have been one our regular places...not now.  :("}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!! Great service and AMAZING breakfast."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this restaurant has such a high rating. We have gone 3 times with high hopes since the reviews are so great but each time we have left disappointed.  Today, we received burnt, cold food with sub-par service. The manager who is great by the way, said he would take 50% off after seeing the burnt food. After waiting a very long time for the check, only one meal was taken off (not 50%) which made us even more dissatisfied. We won't be giving it another try."}
{"text":"We love having brunch at Perk Eatery! The food is always tasty and the service is incredible. I don't think I ever had an empty glass :) Even on the weekends, the staff seats you quickly and brings the fresh food out warm. We'll keep going here again and again!"}
{"text":"Finally able to visit Perk Eatery after reading about their potato pancakes in a Phoenix magazine review. First off let me say the restaurant is a charming throwback to an old fashioned diner. The service was excellent. We were immediately greeted, shown a table by a window, and approached by a server who was very friendly and efficient. We went specifically to have breakfast and I ordered the potato pancakes with applesauce. My friend ordered an omelet with toast and coffee. Food arrived in a timely manner and looked great. I was disappointed in the pancakes which really had some potential, but they turned out to be  very limp and greasy, quite a difference from what was described in the magazine, which said they were crispy. The toast was burned, pretty badly. I'm not sure why a cook would serve that to a customer. We just didn't eat it. The coffee was really watery as well. I see other reviews here that are very positive. Perhaps it was an off day but I have had much better food at other breakfast chains so we probably won't return."}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast enchiladas, took forever to get our meal. When it finally arrived it was barley warm, the tortillas were hard on the outside, the pork on the inside barley visible, ordered eggs over easy one was over easy the other was broken and overdone. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. PRCEY FOR TWO ENCHILADAS."}
{"text":"I came into Perk Eatery one promising Monday morning with my 17 cats and my large tan prosthetic leg. I am instafamous. Keep that in mind. So, as I hopped into a Perk Eatery, I expected the aroma of fresh ground coffee and pinto bean French toast with freshly curded Brie cheese with a dash of cayenne pepper. Instead, I was greeted by the aroma of freshly sprayed homosapian urine and a man with an axe. The man was covered with even more homosapian feces. As I hopped in I asked the Armenian waiter if he could bring in my 17 cats. He replied \"not on my watch, now get in the fryer!\". I was furious. Someone asked for a ham omelet which is why he put me, a poor instafamous woman with only a mere prosthetic leg, into the French toast fryer. He told me he was going to chop off my last leg in order to make a ham omelet for the special costumer. I was going to be a completely legless woman all for an egg dish. He started by slowly chopping my leg off with a spork (a spoon shaped eating utensil with spines at the top.) As I watched my leg being incapacitated, I began to bawl. My cats came to the rescue, but it was too late. Overall, my experience was absolutely incredible and delicious even though I didn't eat one bit. I would recommend Perk for an authentic American breakfast for simple living folks.   Peace and blessings, Lucy"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in north Scottsdale! Staff is very friendly and the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"The food here was just OK. I had an egg scramble with egg whites. Good but nothing that stood out. The flavor of the rosemary potatoes were good but they definitely could have cooked longer. My husband got the Carmel banana French toast. Would've been really good if the toast wasn't so dry. Maybe we came on an off day. I'll defiantly try it again."}
{"text":"We LOVE perk!!!! During our stay at the Westin, Daniel at the nearby Tommy Bahamas Restaurant recommended Perk, we managed to get there every morning of our stay and wish it wasnt so far from home.  Food sooooooo good and service even better!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Everything is freshly made. Green jalapeno salsa is not so spicy but oh so tasty. Veggie omelette was so delicious as were the carmelized banana waffles. Only half mile from Westin Villas"}
{"text":"Great, great local business. I eat here at least twice per month for breakfast. Went today for lunch for the first time. Arrived at noon. Placed was packed, which I was happy to see. I assume most people were still diving into breakfast/brunch fare.  Opted for lunch type food. Ordered the Mucho Smoocho. Very good roast turkey sandwich on grilled rye bread.  I will be back tomorrow for breakfast. Love the pancakes and the staff. Owners are amazing."}
{"text":"Good service. Food came out quickly. Average food taste. Nice atmosphere. Doesn't take American Express?!!"}
{"text":"My co-worker Tom suggested this today for lunch, I had the breakfast burrito, Not bad. The tables and chairs and atmosphere say \"self serve\" until the waiter comes up and fools ya."}
{"text":"Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place.  Went on Fri 5/24/13  to find out that their contract expired on 5/20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon.  Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices.  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich!!  Yikes.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have eaten here for both breakfast and lunch and both equally great...have turned many friends on to the Perks breakfasts..and they also love it. Your staff is the best and the owners always come around and asked how your meal was...quality food served with great portions...and just delicious! Keep up the good work...your food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I went here for my first time today. We were greeted at the door and seated quickly. Then offered drinks and a chance to look at the menu. I noticed many intriguing dishes. I settled for something I thought was safe , The MAMBO , an omelet with sausage , Swiss cheese , mushroom and onion , to which I added red peppers. The omelet was outstanding and so were the skin-on rosemary potatoes. They have this \"secret sauce\" with cucumbers that goes perfectly with the potatoes!   I was very impressed with the wait staff. Also impressed that three people working said , \"have a good day!\" on our exit. I would highly recommend this place!! After reading the five last three star or under ratings on \"YELP\" I would say these people are the type to complain all the time about everything and IGNORE their reviews. I would bet cash to anyone I know that their experience would be as good as mine was!!  I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food - especially the tuna melt. Friendly staff. Has a walk bar area to eat at and order a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Fantastic menu around holidays. All year menu is good as well but I look forward to see what they come up with Mother's Day Father's Day Easter etc. 4 out of 5 because I hate that I have to wait in the heat once it warms up. And there is always a wait to get in so it is inevitable."}
{"text":"I had gone to The Perk about once a month for the last year or so.  I will not ever go back.  We were waiting for a table for about 1/2 hour so I went next store to get my 2 year old a bagel to hold him over.  They said our table was ready and told me that my 2 year old had to finish his bagel and could not bring it in there.  I thought that is rude and obnoxious of the owner and it was not like she was not getting our business the 3 adults that were with me.  I understand an adult but for a child of that age.  NEVER AGAIN.  There are plenty of good restaurants in the North Scottsdale area the only reason I went here was because it was walking distance from our house. I will walk a little further now to be treated how a customer should be treated."}
{"text":"Wine Country French Toast is the best french toast I have had my entire life. I love that they put brie cheese instead of the sweet cream cheese filling that lost stuffed french toast has. Thick and fluffy, and just dreamy. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We've started coming to this place every weekend. With high quality organic ingredients and low prices, you can't beat it. Their food network specials are not the best items on the menu. Anything with their cilantro jalapeño sauce is incredible (and I don't like cilantro!), my wife says the oatmeal is the best she's tasted and their coffee is organic and really good. Do yourself a favor and support Carmen and Pauline and this awesome little place they have!"}
{"text":"I get to Phoenix two or three times a year for family visits and when I am in town this is my \"go to\" place for consistent, quality food at an affordable price. Breakfast is great- I am a particular fan of the huge omelettes and the potatoes. There are also plenty of delicious lunch items to choose from too. Place is at the end of a Safeway shopping center strip that also contains an Einstein Bagels and a Starbucks but Perk is the clear choice if you can get a table. It does get busy at the typical times, but there is outdoor overflow seating and the wait (if there is one) is never too long. Place is clean and the staff could not be any nicer- from the owner to the busboy they all seem genuinely pleased to have you in their restaurant. Give it a try- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My husband raved about this place after he had lunch there one day.  He couldn't stop talking about \"The Lozoya\" sandwich he had.  He loved the cilantro jalapeno sauce that came with the sandwich (which is shocking since he hates cilantro).  So, when we had a free Sunday morning, we went there for a late breakfast, lunch together.  The atmosphere is clean and nice.  It was a bit empty but I think they are still pretty new in town.  I had a Belgium waffle with caramelized bananas (yummy) and a side of corned beef hash (good but the corned beef was just cut whereas I prefer shredded corned beef in my hash).  The meal was good and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perk was delicious! I was initially worried about the wait, but it only took 10 min to get us seated! All the waitresses seemed very efficient and were able to provide great service in a timely manner. We heard about this place from the DDD food network show (since we're from out of town) and thought we would give it a try.   We ordered the breakfast enchiladas, chicken on the coup, and wine country French toast. Each of the dishes were wonderful and my family had a hard time deciding which dish they liked the best.   I definitely recommend it! The food is pretty heavy, but we knew that going in and our stomachs were prepared."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service! Definitely one of my favorite neighborhood spots. Everything we've had there has been good."}
{"text":"Love the Perk! We always eat here when I'm Scottsdale. Great Food at very reasonable prices. The Country Hash is outstanding."}
{"text":"Poor service (despite arriving at a slow time) , prices are super inflated. $16 for the perk scramble (!!). Vegetables not well cooked or seasoned, red peppers didn't taste \"fire roasted\", and really, no cheese?  Will not be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to Perk for a few years and absolutly love it!  Love the food, love the atmosphere and service is always fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin pecan pancakes were terrific!  Came with eggs and bacon. Excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"It has been 2 years since our last visit. The food was good but the portion size has decreased significantly. The new prices are ridiculous !. We paid $8.59 for a side order of 2 pancakes. 3 ounces of maple syrup cost $2.49. Overall we paid $41.69 for breakfast for 2 without tip included. This place is not worth their prices! We will not return."}
{"text":"Really good people here! The food is also very good. Try the huevos rancheros for breakfast and the chipotle chicken sandwich at lunchtime. Good coffee and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  Had the chicken on the coop, potato leek pancakes and huevos rancheros.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place, we go for our monthly girls brunch almost every month ! wish they took amex but other than that the service and management is excellient ! mmm I think I may stop by today :)"}
{"text":"Great place, and exceptional food. Our waitress was caring, quick and courteous. Food was out within 10mins, very nice for our little kids. They can definitely benefit from a nicer hostess, who doesn't tell people to close the outer door, or maybe kindly asks!"}
{"text":"I was staying at Kierland Villas with my sisters for the weekend and checked Yelp to find a good breakfast place near the hotel and we found Perk. Lucky us. It was really terrific. The best part was the service, just nice, helpful and really attentive.   The food was good, I had a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and bacon on whole wheat. Delish. I ordered a fruit plate on the side to counter balance the fat. It was great fruit, blueberries, strawberries and melons. My sisters had omelets, waffles and eggs everyone was happy. I ordered the special coffee and it was very good.   Atmosphere was nice, your basic strip mall neighborhood restaurant. If I find myself up in North Scotts I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this food!!!   I've gotten about all of their sandwiches ! They are all yummy!!! The French fries are perfectly cooked !   All the staff is very sweet & they are always there! They take care of me well & since they do I go there often!!!  The Perk has The BEST waffles I have Ever had!!!  I wish they were open at night , too! ;-)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food,  wonderful friendly service.  Just a great family owned eatery."}
{"text":"Say this on DDD on food network. Happened to be in AZ for work and came here for breakfast with the co workers. Tried both the enchiladas and the chicken in a coup. Freakin amazing. The chile on top of the enchilada was great. I really like that they pan fry the stuffing to give it an extra crisp for the coup dish. Our server was very attentive and gave us a great overview of their menu."}
{"text":"Their breakfast was great! I got the Baja omelette and was a bit hesitant to have chicken in my omelette, but it was really good! We ended up buying the jalapeño sauce too, which was seems to be good on just about everything! We would definitely come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. In the last 2 days we've eaten both breakfast and lunch there. For breakfast, we had pancakes with caramelized bananas and the special breakfast burrito. Both were fantastically prepared and delicious. The service was super friendly and everybody was treated like old friends. The owner came out to greet us and have some conversation. I guess if you don't like this behavior, then you would be happier at Einstein's, where they serve the world's worst bagel.  For lunch, we had the Lozaya, a sandwich with wonderfully seasoned grilled pork, caramelized onions and sweet red peppers. Fantastic! We also had the Perky Turkey salad, everything fresh, well assembled and very delicious.  We would go back to this place at any opportunity."}
{"text":"RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED!!! Rude owners!!!  This morning my family of four had breakfast and with two kids my husband and I it was $53 without tip!!!!  we had a discrepancy and spoke with Pauline who is one of the owners and she refused to make any accommodations or any attempts to rectify the situation. Apparently you can't order pancakes as a side or as a substitute you just get charged for two separate breakfasts. Will NOT GO BACK!!! Pauline & Carmen should rethink their policies, ......customers are the ONLY reason you exist and you treat customers (and employees) like DIRT!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. We had ricotta french toast and a Florentine Benedict. I didn't read the menu closely and when I had to send the Benedict back because it had ham (my fault, ) the owner, Carmen, could not have been nicer about making me another, and he added mushrooms too. Also, very clean."}
{"text":"This part of Scottsdale has needed a good breakfast place forever. I mean, how many times can you go to Chompies?! Thought we'd try it out after it's appearance on DDD. Was really looking forward to enjoying the breakfast enchiladas, but was extremely disappointed.  The only flavor on the plate was the sauce. I tried different ingredients without the sauce, and got nothing. The plate was also really plain looking and you'd think there would be a garnish or something. Parsley, kale, potatoes? I don't  judge a dish by its garnish, but when the flavor isn't there, then everything is fair game in my book. My daughter had an omelette with ham, cheese and peppers which was also bland. Hey guys in the kitchen! Flavortown did a show here, how about some flavor!!! The only thing saving this review was the service and our waitress was great, never needed anything and she was very attentive. Having the bar probably also helps draw in the day drinkers. I'll give it another shot when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"An excellent choice for breakfast in the Valley. We stopped in for breakfast on Father's Day. We opted to share the Chicken in the Coop and Breakfast Enchiladas. Both of savory options topped with eggs. Really like both of them. They are very large portions and very well prepared.  N*Joy...."}
{"text":"I'm sad that it has taken me so long to find this gem.  The menu has everything from mouth watering Breakfast Burritos with chorizo sauce to your traditional favorites like belgian waffles with berries on them.  Feel like a morning pick me up?  Titos Bloody Mary's to the rescue.  But what really makes this place stand out is their excellent service.  We had several visits from our waiter and our coffee was always topped off.  If you live near here be sure to stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I saw this had good reviews on Yelp and even though it's near ten miles away from moon valley we thought we'd give it a try.   This restaurant is located in a storefront in the far southeast corner of a shopping center. Best access is through the side entrance at 66th Street just south of Greenway. Parking was plentiful.  This isn't a large place, might seat 100 or so in one bright, naturally lit room. It also has a low counter with round stools for 6-8. It was full when my girlfriend and I went at about 9:30 AM this past Sunday morning, though we only waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  There's no space designated inside to wait and there's only a few chairs outside to perk oneself until personally summoned by the hostess. I noticed there weren't any misters or shade to be had in the general vicinity so I would imagine an outside wait in the summer would be brutal.  I really didn't find any menu combinations that I instantly fell in love with; I wanted a pancakes, eggs, potatoes and bread combination but I had to order a pancake on the side and settled for an english muffin when I really wanted something more substantial like a bagel. Einsteins bagels is two doors down, you'd think they'd take advantage of the convenience and incorporate bagels into their offerings. I had a small orange juice, it certainly tasted like fresh squeezed and was good but they charge like there's gold dust sprinkled in it.  My girlfriend ordered the sausage/mushroom/onion omelet- while she said she liked it, she would have been happier minus the sausage as it was a ground type as opposed to sliced and was ambiguously flavored (not spicy, not sweet).  She enjoyed the coffee but the wheat toast came incorporated with what looked to me like a combination of seeds and nuts. She didn't bother eating it and thought that information is pertinent to many diners and should be listed on the menu or acknowledged by the wait staff when offering bread selections. She did enjoy the coffee.  The service was standard and the price was a bit more than we like to spend on a simple breakfast; $22 and change including tax, $28 out the door including tip. While there are a number of rave reviews on here about the rosemary potatoes, while we found them just fine we thought they were a bit over-rated and over- powered (taste-wise) the other food on the plate. Maybe best suited for lunch or dinner.  Given the multitude of options, we both agreed we wouldn't be making a return trip even if in the area."}
{"text":"Restaurants need character. They need charm. They need to create an atmosphere. Perk Eatery satisfies all of these for me, without question. And the food? Just right.  I work near Perk, and I've always wanted to stop by and give it a try. Word of mouth made me hesitant, not because of negative remarks, but because everyone I spoke to gushed over the place. I'm normally let down when the bar is set so high.  I strolled in and I was greeted instantly. After being presented with my seating choices, I opted for the breakfast bar. This is when the character kicked in.  If you've been to Perk, you've definitely seen Carmen, zipping around the dining room in his floppy cliché of a chef's hat, running food, filling coffee cups, taking orders, and expediting at the kitchen window. He's a whirlwind of work ethic, moving with a whimsical sense of urgency. Always in a hurry, but never too busy to do as he did when I sat down: deliver incredibly attentive service.  In between calling out \"all days\" to the cooks and pouring my coffee, he suggested I try the special. The fellow perched on the stool next to me concurred, as he had ordered the same. I mulled over the menu for a bit and glanced up when I noticed the aroma of green chilies. Carmen was delivering the special to my neighbor, the green chili pork omelet. Sold.  The chow at Perk isn't so good because of a lengthy and expensive ingredient list, or because of cutting edge culinary technique. Its just good. Its honest, clean, masterfully seasoned comfort food. My omelet was no exception. It was just an omelet, unassuming in nature, but it was perfectly cooked, and blanketed in melt-in-your-mouth green chili pork. Not too spicy, but HUGE on flavor. I used every last bit of my toast and potatoes to clean my plate, and then I wished I had ordered two.   As I was enjoying my breakfast, my coffee cup never ran empty. I watched as orders came and went. I soaked in the ambiance that Perk creates. In the simplest of terms, its controlled chaos. Extremely friendly, controlled, chaos.   Its like the Cheers of breakfast.   Before I had finished, Carmen took the time to introduce himself, and learned my name as well. I haven't been back in yet, but I'd put my money on guessing he remembers it. I learned later that he owns the joint, which makes the experience even more memorable for me.   To see a proprietor work that hard to deliver satisfaction to his guests is inspiring, and it has definitely encouraged me to rave about his spot to anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"This place is very impressive. The food is all made in house and made with natural ingredients. You can really taste the difference! And the service was great too!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here and I go to this shopping plaza probably 2 or 3 times a week. I think its because its tucked in the far southeast corner so its pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it.  What can I say? I'm SO happy to have a new breakfast place that is cheap with good portions and menu choices. I ordered the veggie omelet which was good, oozing with cheese but I would have reviewed it as excellent if it had more veggies. Their rosemary potatoes might be almost as good as mine!  My daughter ordered the Berry French Toast and this could honestly be a dish to split between two people. It was made with good bread (crucial in my book) may have even been brioche and they sure didn't skimp on the berries!  The prices are very good too so if you need to feed a family on a budget this is a good place. Service was a bit slow but they were packed which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month.  Great food and always consistant.  Love the Outlaw Scramble.  Giant portions and excellent service.    Lunch is good too, but I prefer their breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food, great service!  I had the pulled pork and eggs with rosemary potatoes.  Nice atmosphere as well.  Large menu, lots of choices."}
{"text":"1st time here..  layback,relaxful place ,I had the cowboy(steak &eggs) the steak was delicious!!!! moist, tender,!!! the eggs were kind of dry,and cold. potatoes were ok.. nothing special., but the star of the show was there basic pancakes!!! wife gave me that look!! damn!!! coffee was like everywhere else.. service was good   prices start around $14 p.p"}
{"text":"Really good place for breakfast. Excellent service and the food is delicious. The breakfast burrito was awesome."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place... and I'm not a breakfast person so that's say'n a lot! All of the staff are friendly and the place is clean! Amazing food too!!"}
{"text":"Found this place when I googled top breakfast in Phoenix.  The food was great I loved the outlaw scramble.  I recommend it to any one that is hungry.  You can tell by the taste of the food they take a lot of pride in the product."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here! Chose the Breafast Enchiladas which are two flour tortillas filled with pork, black beans and cheese! The were delicious. The service was good"}
{"text":"Went to Perk for my birthday breakfast . This was only my second time here and it still hasn't disappointed us. Friendly staff and amazing food! Everyone in our party always orders something new and everything has been delicious! Why don't I come here more often??!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service. Can't say enough good things about our experience there this morning. There were 6 of us and we each got something different. I tasted everyone's and nothing was short of amazingly delicious. I feel like we found a gem in the desert."}
{"text":"Perk Eatery definitely has its perks. It's convenient and easy to spot, large enough so that a wait on a Sunday morning isn't bad at all and has outdoor tables for enjoying a leisurely Sunday brunch day. Plus, they had some pumpkin pancakes that I demolished in 5 seconds. Good food, good portion sizes, good service. The staff here is very friendly! All in all this place made for a pleasant Sunday brunch day experience."}
{"text":"The food and location are pretty good, and on my one visit here, I was scoping out this place as a potential meeting venue for a large weekly breakfast  group.  However, their front door sign informed me that they do not respect or understand the rights and safety of their law abiding customers.  Therefore, I will not return or recommend until and unless the sign is removed."}
{"text":"So sad. Been here half a dozen times for breakfast.  It's so good usually.  Came in for lunch. My server basically rushed me then ignored me other then to place down a bill. The younger guy that delivered my food was more pleasant.  Lunch was soggy n greasy. Fries were cold. I'll stick to breakfast were I haven't seen this server either!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Perk but it will not be my last. I was here for the May edition of the famous Breakfast Club put on my Monica O. It was really good. I had the famous Breakfast Enchiladas. There is a reason they are famous. Just the right amount of spice. Spice for breakfast sure will wake you up. The pork with the chipotle ricotta and the beans with the eggs on top just all worked together so perfectly. Then topped with the New Mexico red chili sauce that added that spice that brought it all together. Then there was the corned beef hash that I spilt with fellow breakfaster Scott W. I almost didn't want to share. That was amazing too. The corned beef with the country style potatos and the rosemary to set it all off. I couldn't stop eating it. It was hard to pick which I liked more the enchiladas or the hash but the enchiladas won in the end. Not that I will ever turn down the hash again. I will be back to try more wonderfulness off of their menu. I really want to see how their pancakes are. If you can't do good pancakes what kind of breakfast place are you. I'm sure they will be just as fantastic as everything else."}
{"text":"This is a great new neighborhood place and worth visiting.  All fresh ingredients, not pre-cooked.  All the servers are friendly and knowledgeable about the the menu - ask them why each item was named the way it was.  It may be empty at times, but then come at 10am on a Sunday!    Our only complaint is that the menu is set, we couldn't get a make your own omelet.... which is really a bummer at a breakfast spot.  Hopefully they'll change that.  We have eaten here twice for breakfast and once for lunch and looking forward to going back soon.  Finally, it's not a cheap place, but not overpriced either.  Reasonable value for what you're getting, and that's fair."}
{"text":"Every bite lives up to the hype! We saw this place on Guy Fieri's D, D and D and came shortly after I flew into Phoenix. The service was wonderful: warm, friendly, and patient, even though we arrived 15 minutes before closing. They didn't rush us, explained the menu, and served us delicious food. We ordered the breakfast enchiladas (with house made Mexican red chili sauce), chicken of the coup, pancakes and huevos rancheros. Every single plate was finished clean. Then Carmen the owner came out, greeted us as friends though we were first-timers, and made us feel the hospitality of this great find of a restaurant. A must!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! First time here on Saturday for breakfast. Was told there was a 5-10 minute wait but ended up being about 2 minutes. Our server Aldonna was fabulous. She gave us great suggestions that we appreciate. I had the corned beef hash that was fresh and had great flavor. My husband had the Chicken on the Coup. I had a taste and it was a home run! My hubby felt the same and it was devoured. The food came our quickly and was hot. The only complaint I did have was not being offered a refill on the coffee but overall it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We have been on a brunch kick lately and tried to visit a local restaurant but they had too long of a wait. After searching on Yelp, we discovered Perk nearby with no wait at all. After a short drive, we remarked that it looked like a bunch of old people inside. As we were walking up to the door, we said, \"if we don't like it, we never have to come back.\"  We arrived inside and noticed a diversity of ages. We were seated immediately and began looking over the menu. They have a bar which I think used to be a kids play area. The menu is expansive and we discovered that it had also been on the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show on the Food Network.  I ordered the French Toast Combo (two slices of french toast, two eggs, and bacon) along with a café mocha. Spouse ordered an omlet with rosemary potatoes and toast and coffee. Our coffees came out first and then a while later, the food. The portion size again was great, enough for two meals. I accidently spilled the syrup all over the plate, and I don't like my eggs in syrup so they brought me a smaller plate to which I could transfer the eggs.  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. The rosemary potatoes were quite tasty. We were pleasantly surprised that this was a great brunch place and we will return if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Really great local breakfast spot. The signature enchiladas are delicious. They make fantastic bloody Mary's and I haven't tried anything on the menu that I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Yum Yum in my Tum\". everything is made from scratch !!! This place puts a tweak on all of their items . I had the best caramelized banana waffle , if you are allergic to nuts tell them to make yours without the walnuts. So,my AZ peeps ,wake up and go for the drive ... it won't disappoint! As always when you go let me know and enjoy"}
{"text":"Found this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  A little pricey, but the burrito was good and my husband's Huevos Rancheros was wonderful.  The rosemary potatoes my daughter had were also really good! Worth stopping.."}
{"text":"Ridiculous that in 2017 they do not serve any gluten free items. This is including ones that should be such as breakfast meats, eggs and potatoes. We sat down and then left because of this. Will not be returning either."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm not cool enough to have liked this place before it was on TV. Yes, I watch diners and dives even though Guy Feiri is a giant tool. Don't judge me, they go to some good places.   Place was large,  open and clean and service was prompt and friendly.   I had the chicken on the coup and it was a great take on comfort food. This is stuffing covered in gravy, it is neither light or healthy,  but it is delicious.   Wife had breakfast enchiladas and the flavor of the pork was really good. The Chipotle ricotta was a unique twist to them as well."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. The guys in my office swore by it and they were so right! I love finding gems like this that are not big chain restaurants. Delicious original recipes, always fresh and they are so nice! Everything is good, you cannot make a bad choice!:)"}
{"text":"Perk was recommended by a friend who is local to the area. My boyfriend and I were visiting from NYC and determined to eat local.Being foodies we were so excited to hear that Guy from The Food Network ate here. I had the enchiladas.....delicious! My boyfriend had the pancakes.....these had to be the BEST pancakes we have ever had. Light, fluffy and melts in your mouth. Great service and friendly locals."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot in Arizona in my opinion!! The owner Carmine is a great guy and the food is outstanding. Very crowded on the weekend but well worth the wait, especially since they expanded and added a bar, pretty good bloody mary's as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and coffee at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Had breakfast on Saturday....homemade hash and eggs!  The coffee was great and the staff was prompt and friendly!    I recommend this place for a good meal!!!"}
{"text":"This morning, I had the Irishman Omelet with house made corned beef, swiss, and mushrooms, and it profoundly impacted my overall quality of life. I am now prepared to enter 2014 with poise, confidence, and several extra pounds that were TOTALLY worth it."}
{"text":"They don't take AMEX and their food is really bland.  Guy Fieri is full of crap. Last time I get burned on a Food Network referral."}
{"text":"The staff if friendly, the service is quick, the coffee is tasty, and the food is ah-maz-ing. I drool just thinking about Perk Eatery, especially the Chicken on the Coup...and the Wine Country French Toast...and the breakfast burrito. Just go.  Yes, you most likely will have to wait a bit for a table but it is so worth it. They recently expanded into the space next door which is great but I think they still need to be bigger!"}
{"text":"Wine Country French Toast & Chicken on the Coop"}
{"text":"Perk Eatery is one of the best breakfast places in the Scottsdale area.  It's family owned, and serves good quality food. It's not a chain, but instead your typical midwestern breakfast diner with warm folks and good food.  Good job!"}
{"text":"This place is everything you would want in a tex-mex, southwestern style breakfast.  We went here starving and ready to get our coffee/Mimosa fix taken care of.  We were seated right away on a Saturday morning around 10:30 or so.  It's nice and bright and the place is just buzzing with all things breakfast.  They even have a full bar that's set up really cute.  I ordered the Perk Scramble...Holy hell...It was everything I loved.  Lots of eggs scrambled with roasted red peppers, bacon and onions.  The red peppers were so flavorful and the bacon added the perfect amount of savory and saltiness.  Coffee was on point and they keep your cup filled.  Will definitely be back Perk! :)"}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant because we saw it on Guy Fieri's show. We were very surprised and disappointed that he endorsed this place. The wait time was minimal, but the service took FOOOOOREVEEEER! The food was bland and cold. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was fast and friendly.  Perhaps I'm a tough reviewer and there's really nothing wrong here but Perk just didn't feel like some of the other five-star breakfast places.  If you want good, fast, friendly, Perk works."}
{"text":"Best pancake in the city. Hands down.  I'm going to eat there right now. I'm on my way. They need new breakfast potatoes hashbrowns anything is better than what they serve with their omelet but it is a good spot overall"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy, what a fun time I had in Scottsdale and how exciting is it to open up my yelp app to figure out where to go for breakfast.  I came across a few places and this place really stood out by the sheer number of reviews and also this godly Corned Beef Hash dish that I knew instantly, \"I must have this, now!\"  The four of us showed up and were seated quickly.  Our lovely waitress, who must have been from the South originally, couldn't have been friendlier and made us feel instantly welcome.  We ordered the necessities, coffee and fresh orange juice.  Next we gave her our order of the corned beef hash, a couple orders of breakfast enchiladas, and some biscuits and eggs.  We planned on sharing everything.  Any meal, with my fellow familial diners, is never uneventful and naturally, someone knocked over a glass of orange juice sending us panicking for the hills as this delicious nectar was everywhere, literally everywhere.  The waitress and some other staff quickly came over and cleaned it up and even gave this fellow mistaken-prone diner, a new glass.  This little gesture meant so much in my book and I really appreciated the fact that they replaced something that wasn't their fault.  So the food comes and it is everything I was expecting.  The breakfast enchiladas were delicious, maybe needed a little something I can't quite put my finger on but it was, without a doubt, very delicious.  The star of the meal and probably the restaurant was the Corned Beef Country Style Hash.  It was SO AMAZING.  I wanted more and thinking about it now, waiting for my coffee in the coffee press, and staring at plain yogurt on my desk makes me want that meal now more than ever.  With roasted potatoes, huge chunks of corned beef, and then just the right amount of rosemary, this was one of my favorite breakfast dishes, other than eggs benedict.  I absolutely recommend locals and out of towner's alike to visit this place if you haven't already and take advantage of the great service and delicious breakfast food.  I hope I get the chance to visit again!  Take care & savor it up!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to the Perk.  This place has been on the bookmarks for years.  Located on the SE corner of 64 St and Greenway Parkway in the Safeway strip mall.  The inside is small and basic.  A bar area, a few chairs for waiting, and the dining room area.  I ordered the corned beef hash special.  Good portion decent food.  Lots of corned beef, some potatoes, side of eggs, and toast.  The corned beef had a good flavor and was generously added.    I tried my sons waffle and it was decent.  It was on the limp side but had a good flavor.  I prefer my waffles to be crisp on the edges and fluffy in the middle.  This one was neither.  The service was good.  The hostess was friendly and waiter was prompt.  The price for the food was a little high for the quality.  I would have expected some better toast, better waffles, and maybe a side of homemade jam.  While it was good I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back or highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a spot we saw featured on Triple D that always seemed to have quite a crowd waiting. With family visiting we had a large party that ordered an assortment of items. Most were completely forgettable though my Chicken on the Coup was a pleasant and unique dish.   Perhaps I should came in with overly inflated expectations due to the television feature and the price, but I was completely let down. There are a number of breakfast restaurants in the area that stick in my mind. Perk sadly is not one of them"}
{"text":"Simply put, this place rocks. The only way it could get better would be for them to open a location in downtown Phoenix.  Amazing food, perfect service, and a great value make this place a home run. I've only been here two times, but was already made to feel like a regular, which is awesome. Perk has great ambiance, is very clean- and the service is wonderful.  In addition to great dine-in food, they have take-out which is fast and accurate.   Keep up the great work Perk, I look forward to many more tasty breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Good Food...I came specifically since I saw them listed as a top Breakfast place in the North Valley by New Times and I love finding the best breakfast spots myself...can't give 5 stars since they don't take AMEX, huge frustration for a customer to be told how they have to pay...plus AMEX is a major employer in the area...shouldn't alienate a  great set of customers that help fill your seats...add AMEX and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the breakfast enchiladas. SO GOOD! Service is good too, but watch out for the dairy based drinks. They can be iffy. Still a great place though."}
{"text":"Finally made it in to Perk Eatery today.   I LOVED it. It has a very nice decor. The restaurant is spotless, the way I like it.....Nice and CLEAN. (The restroom was very clean also.)   We ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the Fancy Pants Scramble. Both dishes were incredibly tasty.   The Cilantro jalapeno sauce on the Huevos Rancheros was delicious. I would order this again in a heartbeat.   The Fancy Pants Scramble was to die for. The Fig Compote in this dish really made it unique. What an amazing combination of flavors.   I am thankful I saw the TV segment about this place on Fox 10 morning show recently, otherwise I might not have known this fabulous restaurant existed.  I will be back many more times.   Perk Eatery puts The Good Egg and Mimi's Cafe to shame. Absolutely no comparison.  You will not be disappointed in this wonderful Eatery."}
{"text":"For the past 2 years now 8 of us dine around the Valley and have formed a critique team. We are in search for the best breakfast location in our area. We have tried over 30-40 locations and have a certain criteria we grade on. In no particular order we grade on service, taste of food, ambiance of decor, attentiveness of staff if an issue arises, overall experience and so on. We have experienced from 1-4 stars until now. Perk gets a 5 star rating from all of us!! Shout out to Giavonni at Perk as he was the best server ever and dealt with our every need fast and with a smile. Long story short.... EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT!!  Go to Perk if you want the best. Thanks for a top notch breakfast experience PERK."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot. Veggie Omelet with egg whites was good. When we arrived we had to wait 10 minutes while the hostess ran around doing things and there were open tables for four abundant. Otherwise, delicious food and friendly service. We will be back."}
{"text":"I yelped a place for breakfast, and chose Perk because of the decent prices (not too high) and the location, plus Guy Fieri's picture probably influenced me, to be honest. He doesn't choose lousy spots! We had friendly service on what appeared to be a slow Tuesday morning. Just like we like! We could've sat outside, which would have been pleasant, but the 5-year-old chose inside. No problems. I was happy to be eating out in a quiet place. It's also nice when you see locals enjoying themselves. It wasn't trendy and hip and loud.  My food was average. I had oatmeal. You can't mess that up! My daughter had 3 chocolate chip silver dollar pancakes with watermelon - a nice touch we can't get in PA this time of year! And my husband had a breakfast burrito. It was big and full and fantastic, according to him.   There's not much more to say. I was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Portions were more than ample, service was attentive.  You could tell the place draws it's regulars, but it's a good option for visitors as well.  I had an egg sandwich on ciabatta bread, and my partner had pancakes.  We were both pleased."}
{"text":"Wow!  How did so many people rate this a 4 or 5?   We went there this morning for breakfast for our first time, and I might add....our only time.  For starters, even the coffee is not quality coffee.  Then we went on to the menu and we ordered eggs.  They must make a batch of scrambled eggs and spoon them on the plate when an order comes in.  Mine were dry, over cooked and maybe just plain sitting under a heat lamp.  My husband ordered eggs with cheese.  The first time they were cold and the sheet of cheese was hardly melted!  Service was good, but there was nothing on this menu to get us back.  We are fairly discerning consumers, and I don't know why people would go back if they messed up on the basics!"}
{"text":"Ok, so we have lived close by and never knew this gem was here until the Diners show.   Wanted to go, but never made it.  I read the yelp reviews this morning and one reviewer said \" Stop reading and go!\"   So, we did just that and we were so happy we did! I was worried it would be too busy just before 10 am on a Sunday, but other reviews said they didn't have long waits.  Exactly true! We were told 5 minutes and that is exactly how long we waited.  The staff is super friendly and professional.  The food is to die for! French toast so light it is heavenly! Pancakes golden and delicious. The huevos rancheros is AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!   So worth it! Stop reading and go!  Super happy to have this gem in our hood! We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast. You'd think if you make as many eggs you'd know how to do them right.  Better eggs at the hotel egg station."}
{"text":"Ok this place is HIGHLY OVER RATED! I really would pass. The food was mediocre are best, slightly cold when served. Asking for refills on coffee or ice tea was like waiting for Congressional Approval...   The menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors.   Unfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.  There are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier."}
{"text":"Good food.good service. Terrible coffee. Always come back, but each time the coffee is so weak!"}
{"text":"We love going to this place! Never have a bad meal. Busy on weekends but worth wait. Staff is friendly and food comes quickly.  My favs are the pumpkin pancakes and Mediterranean omelet. Kid friendly too.  Beats any of the other breakfast places around here!"}
{"text":"I cannot give enough stars!! Food is perfection and staff is polite, welcoming and entertaining! If you don't check this place out, you're missing a good time and great food!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food with some unique flavors and new twists on old favorites. Not your typical diner/breakfast joint."}
{"text":"It is a good breakfast place it became famous after drives dives and diners.they have pretty good service however my first dish came out called they take it back and it came out a lot better. That was the Sonora kitchen scrambled."}
{"text":"Just found this place, what a find! Service was great and the food was even better! The rosemary potatoes are the best I've ever eaten!! Also a plus, this place is kept impeccable, very clean! Believe the hype!!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy little place in a strip that you would not notice unless someone told you to meet them there.  I am lucky as I happen to live around the corner.  Great service and food.  The chef or cook or manager is very attentive.    I guess I am not sure as he has the chef's hat on and also comes around to make sure everyone enjoys their food. And the rest of the staff is very nice.  The rosemary potatoes are nice change to basic hashbrowns (of which I am always a fan).  Oh and you can get lattes and caps, as well as, regular coffee and tea.  I recommned it.  And during the week there is never a wait."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, strip mall diner vibe to it.   Really good.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Excellent local business. Very fresh, very creative, very flavorful and mostly locally-sourced (if I am not mistaken) dishes. And the difference in taste is palpable. A robust menu. Excellent service and ambiance. My go-to dish, the greek salad, is amazing. And other items are excellent as well. This is a very feel-good type place. My only qualm is the 3 pm closing time, because I would almost certainly frequent this restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Phoenix.  Every January when I come to Phoenix this is a must stop eatery for me. Portions are generous, the staff is amazing, and the food is out of this world! I'd recommend coming during the week because the weekends are packed."}
{"text":"Not to impressed with service at the bar for single women.  Servers more interestes in talking amongst themsleves.  For claiming they have midwest roots, they sure have a stuck up  attitude."}
{"text":"We have been interested in this place since it was on tv awhile back but it was always busy with a long wait.  We had breakfast and were mostly happy with our choice. I suppose it will always be busy on Sunday morning and it was hectic.  It was also efficiently run.    The noise level was sometimes a challenge and food trays can block the aisles.  We had great service. Our waitress refilled water often. When my wife asked for more butter, it appeared instantly.  I had a Perk-Fect Bloody Mary and it was good.  My wife had the pumpkin pancake combo and was pleased.  I had the cheesy hash, toast, potatoes and egg menu item. It was very rich but I got through it. I prefer potatoes in a hash dish to be bite sized. These were on the upper end for that.  My food came luke warm and I prefer my toast hot and the eggs and potatoes hot.  I ate quickly. I suppose my plate was put aside waiting for pancakes."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for breakfast in Scottsdale, perk eatery is legit. Big portions, delicious, healthy. I ordered an omelette which hit the spot! Reminds me of Matt's big breakfast downtown. Very low key, authentic. Perk has a mom n pop feel to it. Easily a top 5 breakfast restaurant in valley. I will be coming back for more soon!"}
{"text":"After all the hoopla and all the recommendations finally decided to give this place a shot. I'm with my best friend and my 3 year old son.  We walk in and get seated right away. place looks really nice and plenty of people vouch for it. We sat down and not a single word has been said by our server. we start looking at the menu and talking it over with my friend and son. A family sits next to us and still waiting for a 4th person. the server walks up to them and gives them the run down walks to get them coffee and waters. walks back and helps the 4th person get into their seat. he explains the menu and says he will be back shortly. He walks to the other table on our other side, helps them and asks of they need anything else. We are ready to order and he keeps walking and helping everyone else around us. The man next to us leans over and says \" want me to order for you guys? i can clearly see whats going on\" I say no thank you. I wait another 10 minutes and still nothing. my son is asking for pancakes and juice. The man and family next to us receives their meals and are looking at us ashamed considering they arrived around 10 minutes after us and to this point the server has yet to say 1 single word to us. I finally have had enough and wave down the \"server\" he shockingly walks over and i ask for the manager he doesn't say a word and walks away. Him and another man walk towards me the \"server\" sarcastically says \"did i forget to serve you\" i told the manager the story and that i was leaving. he said \"OK have a nice day\"  everyone looked as us as we got up put our coats on and heard my son saying he wanted pancakes. As a purple heart recipient from the war in Iraq this is not what i think about when i think of America. I don't think i have ever felt this from a business. the embarrassment and walking away like we did something wrong by walking out. No single apology or NOTHING. So i cant recommend a business in which didn't even serve us a glass of water. I can assure that neither I or anyone I know will ever attend this establishment after this incident. NO APOLOGY WAS EVER RECEIVED."}
{"text":"This place is packed!!! And wow does this look tasty! Omg delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here this morning had the French toast with caramel banana topping. So so yummy . Mambo omelet very average. Potatoes over cooked, very dark and greasy. Staff were extremely friendly"}
{"text":"We are never coming back here again. We came as a big group of 20 and the owner and waiter Sue will not do split check. They were rude and practically said no to almost every request we made. Then if we order for our kids, they would bring the food to us and we had to deliver it to our kids, which was just across us. The waiter Sue has so much attitude and was rude and even stomped the cups and plates as she put it down. She never smiled and was hardly there to ask if we need anything else.  The food wasn't that good too. The potato with corned beef was awful.  So sad that ever since they got bigger they became a snub and forgot about good customer service. They even said that the area they placed us in had a minimum of $500...that's total BS.  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast enchiladas were amazing! No pic to share because I ate it all too quickly ;-) Also had the huevos rancheros which was equally delicious, wish we could eat this every day. Great coffee and great service, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled on this place while doing some early morning errands and we were both pleasantly surprised. It's nice, clean, well lighted and locally owned, which is a big plus for us considering the amount of chains in my area.   We ordered french toast and their Pumpkin pancake special. They both were really great, to the point of being stuffed -  we skipped lunch altogether.   She ordered a cappuccino, which she wasn't too thrilled with, and that was the only knock. My standard cup o' coffee was just fine.  The service was attentive and all of the staff was incredibly friendly.   We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Close your eyes -- imagine the local diner of your dreams... Open you eyes -- you have arrived at Perk!  Amazing food (it is super consistent, never a bad meal here) with customer service that is always on point.    The pancakes and omelettes are tops!"}
{"text":"So very good!  Pancakes, chorizo breakfast burrito w homemade jalapeño cilantro salsa, everything is terrific.  My kids love it too.  Wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for my birthday breakfast. We were welcomed warmly and seated promptly. Our server was friendly and on top of his game. Prompt but not in a rush.  We find many restaurants too noisy but Perk wasn't bad at all. We were at a table by the window and it got a little warm. I moved to the other side of the table and we were comfortable. There's a small patio but it overlooks the parking lot so that wouldn't be my first choice.  The food -- oh my! I had the French toast with Caramelized bananas and a side of sausage links. THe food was delicious, hot, generous portions. Hubby had the steak and scrambled eggs with toast, and rosemary potatoes. He said the filet was perfectly tender and cooked just right. It was a huge plate of food but he ate all of it. Now, we had some of the more expensive items on the menu and our bill came to $36. This is not a cheap breakfast but we would definitely come back.  They are also open for lunch and I think well give it a try. The burger with Brie sounds so good!"}
{"text":"What a cute find!  I love a place where breakfast items are served in the afternoon. Attentive and friendly service with great food.  I noticed they also serve organic coffee, which actually isn't that easy to find."}
{"text":"It would be better if the server listens to the customer's order, submit the order, and when the order comes out, CHECK the order against what is actually on the plate. I ordered pancakes, with eggs over medium and bacon. What came out was pancakes, scrambled eggs, and a sausage. I pointed out that, there are 2 mistakes on the plate. However, I will keep the egg, but do not wish to keep or eat the sausage. In fairness, the server did apologise, and said he'll bring out the bacon. The bacon did not arrive until I almost finished the pancakes and the eggs. The server brought the bacon on a small plate, told me to slide the bacon off of his plate on to mine. Then, the server asked me to put the sausage that was on my plate on to his plate.  First. Apology does not unring the bell! Second. I hope the sausage was not recycled and got on to someone else's plate  Finally, I am certain the smug server expected his gratuity none-the-less. The management should train the servers more effectively."}
{"text":"Oh Breakfast Club, my favorite social group, just what would we do without you? I for one would probably eat a lot less breakfast, and I wouldn't have such awesome people to hang with, that's for sure.  The long trek ensued from my humble abode in Cenpho, Monica, I hope you know I don't travel this far for just anyone. Finally landing on the huevos rancheros, my taste buds were excited to dig in. The cilantro jalepeno sauce was delicious with a good mixture of spice and flavor, it was tasty.  With a decent sized group of 12 or so, the staff were able to accommodate us without many hiccups at all. We all chatted, got to know each other more, hung out, and had a great time. Be sure to try this place out soon!  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a co-worker after trying to find someplace new.  It's a nice little breakfast & lunch diner.  Food and service was good and the prices are very affordable. Our waiter was very on top of our drinks when they would get low and checked in just the right amount of times.  Good find in a large shopping center :)"}
{"text":"We were surprised to find this breakfast spot mostly vacant at 7:30 AM on a Friday morning. I had the corned beef hash with Swiss cheese on top and fried potatoes. Pretty good, but I thought it was on the greasy side. My wife had an omelette with two eggs and she thought it was decent. Overall, we weren't completely swept off our feet, but it was a-ok."}
{"text":"Not enough money in the universe for me and my friends to go to Perks again. Rude manager. The word I would like to use to describe her I can not print. Our waitress was great but that manager is one angry human being. Spoils the visit. Food OK nothing to write  home about. Little season in dressing. Corn beef not great.I will stick to Mimi's or Chompies."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out this Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives spot with some girlfriends today for lunch and it did not disappoint!  The service was so friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere was casual and nice and the food was great.  I enjoyed the chicken gyro and loved every bite of it.  Definitely worth a stop for a quick breakfast or lunch while in the Kierland area."}
{"text":"Sampled the classic pancakes, Western omelet, and Gordo omelet. All good. The Gordo is definitely tastier than the Western. The Omelets are traditionally served with rosemary potatoes and toast.  Nothing outrageously good but if you need a place with great service and accessible, give this place a try. The price is on the high end for breakfast. The servers are more than attentive. Had 5 different people ask how we were doing on top of the typical rounds by our server. This place gets packed on the weekends. Less than 1/2 a mile from the Westin Hotel. Giving this place a 3, again its good but nothing stands out and the price point could be better."}
{"text":"Well, thank goodness for another fabulous recommendation on Triple D. We were tempted to try both the Chicken Coop and Breakfast Enchiladas for breakfast but opted to actually SHARE the Breakfast Enchiladas. We arrived before 9am and there was a small wait. Very friendly staff. Owner kept coming out and visiting guests and helping staff. The enchiladas were plenty to share actually and very filling. We will be back to try the Coop. Who doesn't love stuffing for breakfast."}
{"text":"If your looking for your normal breakfast don't come here if your looking for modern breakfast with a twist then you might like it here. I just wasnt a fan of rosemary potatoes in the morning or slow roasted pork with eggs."}
{"text":"I used to love Perk but this morning it was not good.  The service was terrible and my husband and I both complained that the rosemary potatoes were very under cooked and tasted like they were made yesterday. The waiter did nothing and said nothing.  No apology, no offer of something else. We let the owner know, assuming other people would not be able to eat them either.   He said they were using different potatoes.  That's it.  Between the service and changes in food quality, we won't be back. No one seems to care any more."}
{"text":"Amazing food with really good service. You must try the potato pancakes and corn beef hash, truly house specialties. My kids loved the French toast and The Cowboy medallions were amazing. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"When I entered Perk,I expected the smell of fresh perked coffee wafting thru the door. No aroma . I anticipated a deep rich scent of freshly brewed coffee as the waiter approached our table with two cups. No aroma.  Average  coffee served not with fresh cream in a pitcher but with a dish of aseptic half and half already on the table. This  is Perk.!   My waffle was warm and soggy not even as good as the free make it yourself I recently had at a chain hotel.  And the  side of berries for $1.50 included exactly 12 blueberries and some  flavorless sliced strawberries. My companion's side order of a biscuit $1.50,  to accompany his egg special , came naked on a plate . No butter, no honey, again aseptic packets of jelly were on the table, so I offered to share some of the butter that was with my waffle.  With so many breakfast places in Scottsdale, Perk , you need to Perk up!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Nice portions. Featured on the FOOD NETWORK! I work just a few doors down at Studio North Yoga & Dance and it's always a treat to stop by the Perk for a bite to eat. Reuben sandwich was delish! Also had pancakes there too. Just a great neighborhood joint that you have to try at least once, or twice or make it a habit like me and go there all the time!!!"}
{"text":"Even though Perk has been in Scottsdale since 2010 this was the first time I went there and am so glad I did! Had the BEST Huevos Rancheros in Arizona!! Can't wait to come back for breakfast and lunch and try other items on the menu. I've been craving a great Huevos and the last great one I had was when I was New Mexico!!"}
{"text":"I love this place my favorite thing to eat is the chicken on the coup it's so amazing! I get it with scrambled eggs. My fiancé got the outlaw scramble with potatoes it was so delicious ! You must try this place"}
{"text":"Awesome find, one of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale/Phoenix ( thanks from my friend Tim)Corned beef hash, Huevos Rancheros was off the hook .. Even  the owner was out working tables and greeting customers - love to see that old school service. Food was exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Food is not good, im entirely unimpressed with this place! I ordered all of my food dairy free, asked for my toast to be dry ( unbuttered) I explained that I cannot have dairy and yet my food still contained dairy and my toast came buttered. I've eaten here a few times and something has been wrong every single time."}
{"text":"Friend said he seen Guy from the food network do a show here, so we decided to come and check it out. Got here at 6:30am on the dot and ordered the Enchiladas,  the plate was very good and had good taste to it.   Was expecting a bit more but wasnt bad."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my visit to Perk. Recently, one of my co-workers came in to work raving about the breakfast he had at Perk, insisting I try them out as well. Well I figure, who am I turn down such an endorsement? I couldn't be happier that I listened to him.  First off, the atmosphere. This felt to me just like sitting around at a table at home with the family for a good old home cooked breakfast. The staff were all extremely friendly and good humored. All the patrons were relaxed and smiling. Everything was just right.  Then we get the food... not only did it come out very quickly, but wow was it great. I actually had a lot of trouble deciding from the menu, everything looked so good. So I decided to go with a special the waitress mentioned which wasn't on the menu; biscuits and gravy. Simply put: wow. I may have had better gravy before, but I honestly can't remember when. I was in love from the first bite. The portion was absolutely perfect as well. I finished up my breakfast and was quite full, without being too stuffed.  Needless to say I will be returning here. This has become my new breakfast joint in the area. Even for lunch. Because breakfast food is great any time of the day."}
{"text":"Could be a 4, the waffle was a little hard, my son enjoyed the French toast thought his scramble was missing flavor. My wife had the Gordo which could've had more flavor. She also had the pancake which I would give it a thumbs up. I had the boarder patrol omelet which I thought was good. The wait staff is friendly and the place was very clean. And the food was extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after looking up dinner drive in and dives...this place lives up to its hype. Must order items...cheese corn on the coop...lemon ricotta French toast and the potato pancakes. All were heavenly and devoured quickly. Will make this our go to breakfast spot when visiting AZ"}
{"text":"We love Perk! After two days of eating overpriced, tasteless breakfasts at our hotel, we decided to find something more satisfying. We hit the trifecta with this place...clean, great food, and awesome service. Ana, our server, is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and thinks of everything you may need before you realize you need it. The salsas and sauces are homemade and delicious. They have all of the basics for the non-adventurous, i.e., eggs, bacon, pancakes, omelets, etc. and they also have wonderful and unique combinations, such as the special I ate yesterday, which included tender, slow-cooked pork, ricotta and black beans, served enchilada style in flour tortillas with a homemade red sauce and two over-easy eggs on top...delicious!! Today I was in the mood for steak and eggs and for $14 I enjoyed a perfectly-cooked FILLET with 3 eggs and tasty (not frozen) breakfast potatoes with a side of homemade salsa that Ana brought with my meal, because of how much I enjoyed it the day before. It's those small touches that makes a great place even better and more memorable. The owner even checked in on us to make sure that we enjoyed our meal and to thank us for coming. We ate there twice and were treated like regulars, saying our goodbyes to everyone, like old friends, on our way out! Definitely bookmarking this one for future visits to the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"As someone who is a confirmed corned beef hash lover I was really looking forward to coming here.   It may not be the best hash I have had but it is in the top three. It also came recommended from a Yelp friend.    My wife went with the Wine Country French Toast which she loved. It has Brie cheese sandwiched between two large slices of French Toast topped with roasted grapes and a Rosemary wine syrup.    Needless to say I went with the Corned Beef Country Style Hash.  Our server explained how it is prepared every morning and made to order.  It was accompanied by two sunny side up eggs and two thick slices of whole wheat toast.   Apparently within the last couple of years business has grown exponentially as they have expanded to the space next door and have added a bar. I would have loved to try the Bloody Mary but was driving.  Maybe next time I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"Serving bottled water over tap-water-ice is usually a sign of bad things to come.   Like 99% of all other restaurants in the valley,  everything served here is provided from a limited handful of suppliers, in bulk, canned, powdered, or frozen.  This is a desert after all so for the price, you better impress me.   Perk Eatery?  Not so much.  The \"beef\" on the corn-beef hash distinctly looked like the pastrami sandwich meat I had served to me on the mediocre Reuben on another visit and the potatoes in the hash appeared to be exactly as those on the plates of my guests who had \"hash browns\".  How novel.  I sent mine back.  My youngest guest seemed to enjoy his pancakes. Kind of hard to mess up pancakes.  My other guest ordered an omelet and asked for the onions and peppers to be served on the side.   After some animated facial hesitation, the waiter announced that he would only do this for her \"this one time\".  Oh sir,  if you only knew how accurate your statement actually was."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place. Cuisine rather than merely sandwiches. I enjoyed the \"For Pete's Sake\"--steak sandwich grilled to medium-rare perfection. Hubby loved \"The Bahama Mama\"--grilled chicken stuffed in a moist pita, topped with a slightly tangy sauce that cut the sweetness of pineapple chunks. Potatoes that popped with the comforting hint of rosemary. The place was packed and although lunchtime, most were having breakfast. Although the location décor is a bit lacking (fluorescent lighting) the wait staff is first-rate and the owner himself inquired about our meal. We will now be found at PERK regularly."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I always check the restaurants ratings before I go in and try out their food, specially a for brunch since theirs only a few places I know, but this one by far it was the worst place Ive ever been to. I had the Bahamas Mama sandwich and the chicken was under cooked or something because I end up in the ER for food poisoning."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, locally owned!!"}
{"text":"We've been want to go for breakfast for some time.  Sat outside with my wife and chihuahua at this dog friendly restaurant.   Staff brought a dog bowl with water.   Service was very friendly and timely.   I had the Baja omelet with egg white - yummy.  Wife enjoyed the Perk Scramble.  Very pleasant experience.  We may become regulars : )"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local breakfast places. Small, but wonderful food and service. My favorite breakfast item is Chicken On The Coop. It's like Thanksgiving and breakfast all in one dish, delicious! We live right across from this restaurant and go there once in a while, but the servers always remember us and make us feel very welcome! Its a must try with delicious original menu items. A Scottsdale hidden gem."}
{"text":"If we lived here, we would eat here every day! The Bahama Mama and Jamaican Chicken Sandwich are both fantastic! Great food, great drinks, great service!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here regularly over the past year.  The chicken on the coupe is nothing short of amazing.  The gravy is supreme and the crispy stuffing is da bomb.  Service is sometimes spotty and for a local joint, I expected grapefruit juice to be fresh."}
{"text":"Joined my fellow Yelpers for a little breakfast at Perk. I must confess, Its been a while since my last visit, due to the distance between where my life takes place and this little ditty. Of course there's a good size wait to enjoy this eatery but not if your a true Yelper, bahahaha. It also helps to show up a couple minutes late. The place has expanded. Joke on the wall says the pushed out the kids play zone to make way for a bar. I didn't find myself being entertained in this neck of the woods so I can't rate it but by the looks of the patrons I'd say they were definitely enjoying themselves. I must say the food hasn't changed! I order the Gus food channel recommendation-banana carmel walnut  pancake contraption. Not sure if I added or left out a couple ingredients there but you should know it was delish! Just so you understand how big of a deal this is, I eat breakfast all times of the day. Most importantly, nothing is more important than having some kind of egg concoction with lots of delicious meat(S) in it and perhaps a bed of crispy hash browns to create a heartiness, but these pancakes are sooooo good that I bypassed my SOP - standard operating procedure. When your in the neighborhood, this is one great place to catch a bite to eat.   My recommendation--- The banana pancakes. The other stuff on the menu is good too, but your not reading my review for good, your here for the Grrrrrrrrr-eat!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese with ham I've had in years. Service was amazing. I've heard that the breakfast is great, so I am going to try that since it was also suggested that the wait, unlike at every other place in town on the weekend, isn't painful."}
{"text":"They have amazing breakfast potatoes! Love their sausage as well. My little sister got their breakfast enchiladas and loved them! I enjoy their hot chocolate! My older sister got their caramelized banana nut waffles and said they were to die for! I'd love to try their lunch someday!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here! The service is always prompt. Always clean. The portions are humongous and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Good service, my coffee was bottomless! Try their French toast yumm!"}
{"text":"this little place redeemed food in scottsdale for me. excellent, friendly staff - fresh, delicious food. we will certainly visit the perk when we return to arizona."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out today, and it was pretty good. The customer service was friendly and the place was pretty well laid out.  I ordered the breakfast enchiladas and my wife got the biscuits and gravy.  The enchiladas were pretty good, though they were made with \"chunked\" pork and  I think I would have prefered shredded. The red sauce was spicy as advertised. My wife said her gravy and biscuits were good, but the gravy was not the best. They have a nice assortment of coffees and teas to choose from as well.   Our waiter was really friendly. He made sure my tea was full at all times. We also did not have to wait for the check or to be able to pay, which is always a plus.  All in all its a place I would definitely visit again, and I would recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast spot for some very tasty food.  The potatoes are awesome with rosemary seasoning and the bacon is thick and crispy.  I'm a fan and would go back again."}
{"text":"Cool little brunch place hidden deep in a strip mall. Have come by a few times during the brunch rush and have been too hungry to wait. Finally went by a little bit later last weekend and was treated a tasty meal.  I had the Lozoya sandwich which is pork with sautéed onions, red peppers and jalapeños. The pork was tender and juicy. Overall the sandwich was salty, savory, and just what I needed for my slight hangover. Came with fries that were pretty standard.  Service was good, the place was busy. I wish they were open later into the afternoon or for dinner.  I do look forward to going back to try more options and maybe find that 5th star."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot. All local and organic food. Service was friendly, atmosphere was a little lacking. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience here today.  Omelet that we ordered was incorrect, ingredients were not according to the menu, when we asked, we were told it was correct.  The potatoes that we got on the side were still partially refrigerated/frozen, not a good experience."}
{"text":"Clean, nice staff, good food.  I almost stopped at Denny's for convenience instead of driving the twenty minutes to the Perk...I was killing time between appointments, so what the Hell eh?    Glad I did when I got here I realized this was a Guy Fieri triple D place, I think. And I think I had what he had, the breakfast enchiladas, it was very good.  Although I know Guy hates eggs this dish had the two eggs on top and it was fantastic.  Just the right amount of spicy for most.  I like it a little hotter but it worked for sure.  Gonna go with four stars,but could easily be five...."}
{"text":"Such a nice place to grab breakfast or lunch. Our waitress reminded me of my grandmother, so warm and welcoming.  The place is very lit up, lots of windows.  The food was great! I had the breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon.  Although simple, it was delicious! Bacon is perfect, English muffin was soft, I will go back!"}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast! Love the huevos rancheros there and the staff. It is one of the best in town! They also make amazing lattes at Perk;)"}
{"text":"Headed here over the weekend and there was a bit of a wait to get seated - 10 minutes, so not bad despite the number of people standing outside. Server came over pretty quickly, but seemed rushed and wasn't overly attentive after ordering, but it was slammed, so not a really big deal.  I had the potato pancakes and she had the corned beef hash.  The potato pancakes had an odd flavor that we couldn't place.  There were orange pieces in it that we dwindled down to either cheese or sweet potato (most likely the latter of the two).  The corned beef hash was good, but not the best we've had in the area.    We would probably go again, but considering that we are still new to the area and there are so many places to try, it may be awhile before we head back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast spot on Scottsdale. Everything is amazing and everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, good portions & friendly service!  Had omelette for breakfast & would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Late Sunday morning, my husband I were looking for a tasty breakfast spot to dine.   Myself, being the ever-adventurous one, wanted to discover a new place to dine.  Perk Eatery (6501 E. Greenway Parkway #159, Scottsdale, AZ  85254) is the wonderful discovery I did indeed find on this Sunday.  A spacious atmosphere, bright, clean and friendly is what welcomes you the minute one enters Perk Eatery.  We were immediately seated, even with the restaurant noticeably full.  At still 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning, Perk was still \"hopping\" and every server and the owner himself, Carmen Martinez, was busy moving along dishes from the kitchen.    Their menu boasts a wide array of breakfast and lunch delicacies.  Their meals are made fresh and from local organic products.  One can choose from a variety of egg dishes, pancakes or French toast, or if lunch is on your mind go for one of their burgers or sandwich specialties.  Their combination dish of eggs, choice of meat (bacon or sausage link) and French toast is a must to try for any customer.   Their eggs are cooked to your liking and the sausage link is thick and juicy to the taste.  What is most amazing about this particular meal was their French toast.  Their French toast was soft, buttery, and grilled with the egg mixture just perfect.  Once coated with their syrup it made for a delicious combination in my mouth.  What a delight to have found Perk Eatery, tucked away in this strip mall right off Greenway Road (Safeway Plaza).   I can hardly wait to try their lunch next time!   A hidden gem, it truly is, be sure to find your own favorites at Perk Eatery today."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place would highly recommend ,flavorful meals my favorite dishes chicken on the coop,breakfast enchilada and now most recently the blueberry pancakes,oh don't forget to order the rosemary potatoes or corn beef hash .Can't wait till next visit"}
{"text":"Caught it on a good morning.  The place was humming and, unlike other reviewers, our service was spot on.  I appreciated some of their innovative takes on the standard breakfast menu, specifically the breakfast enchiladas."}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes, eggs and service. A bit picky about  upcharges.  Strong rec for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place never fails me. The secret is in their sauces amd doing a wonderful job of braising their meats."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this was the worst breakfast I have ever, ever had. Scrambled eggs had a pink hue and no flavor.  My daughters bacon was burnt. We ordered a waffle and it was soft and squishy, and ill formed. Never have I ordered a waffle that was not hot, crisp, and golden brown.  This one completely missed the mark. Not edible."}
{"text":"How in the world are they rated so well. They get one star for good service but then again we were the only ones in the restaurant so I don't even know if that's A good judgment. Portion sizes were tiny.  really no sides to the main dish you had to order everything else on top of it it. Our meal was far more expensive than it should've been compared to everything else in the area. We eat out to breakfast often & i'm pretty sure we paid more $$ for half of the food elsewhere. We tried it twice and will never go back."}
{"text":"After getting my car fixed this random Tuesday around lunchtime I was prompted to stop to pick up some lunch on my way into work.  This was at the end of a Safeway shopping center and looked a lot more healthy than Blimpie and Humble Pie.  I decided to give it a shot.  After looking at the prices I was a bit concerned, but then the nice man at the booth in the front of the place told me the special I was intrigued.  Gyro with vegetable soup.  Sounded delicious.  The gyro is flavorful and even when I asked them for a side of tatziki sauce they told me that I wouldn't need it.  They were right.  The gyro was delightful, fresh and exactly what I was wanting.  The vegetable soup was hearty and even their chai tea latte was amazing.  I was a bit bummed that they had no soy or almond milk, but that was only worth 1 star on my review.  Other than that this place is a must try.  If I lived nearby I would stop in regularly for breakfast.  Cute little place!"}
{"text":"Excellence.  I just discovered this little eatery  near our house. I'm blown away by the breakfast here! It's also been on diners, drive ins and dives.  Definitely order the corned beef hash. It's fantastic ! There's a counter if you come solo and don't want to wait for a table too!"}
{"text":"It's like a traditional breakfast place, typical style menu...but a step up. Rosemary breakfast potatoes- with fresh cut Rosemary.  I got a Mediterranean omelet with spinach, mushroom, onion, feta, and a tzatziki sauce on top. It was so delicious, very healthy, very fresh. Service was good. It was busy, but no sacrifice in quality or a long wait. Prices were average. No complaints, look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"The breakfast choices were interesting, a nice change from the standard ingredients and presentations.  I also liked the coffee drink selections, they have much more than just plain coffee.  Overall I found the quality to be very good, though the price is a little high for breakfast.  I do not eat in Scottsdale very often, but this was a good breakfast choice."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fair prices, only knock is they don't take Amex."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast here because we were nearby. Fast service. Reasonable option for low carb/keto. I had 2 eggs over medium and a side of bacon, plus decaf (which going forward I will call my no fuss keto friendly breakfast). I think my order came up to about $10 something before tax and tip. Hubby had a chorizo omelette, 'border' something I think it is called.  Our server Aldonna was prompt and friendly.  We would probably be regulars if the location was convenient, but it not close enough for us."}
{"text":"Good food. My girlfriend loves the breakfast enchiladas. Service is always good and the Rosemary potatoes rock. It is a favorite Diner, Drive-in, and Dives. Check it out...  #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Charged $1.00 for 2 small sides of very watered down ranch dressing we wanted for our fries. (No heads up on the xtra charge).  Breakfast sandwich was on burnt toast with a teeny piece of ham. = $5.99 Reuben was dry = $9.99 Daughter liked the Bahama mama sandwich. =$8.99 Server had zero personality.   My money will not be wasted here again."}
{"text":"Great eatery we happened upon while visiting a friend! Hostess had a sense of humor, joking with us while seating us and waitress gave a great recommendation of the potato pancakes (so yummy, highly recommend them!) Also had the \"wine country French toast\", which was a delightful twist on the traditional French toast. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Quality ingredients and good service. The Irishman is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food a bit pricey!  As with many DDD establishments its hard to not let your imagination get ahead of reality.  Food was good, service was GREAT...the wine/brie stuffed french toast sounded better on tv then in person.  Will come back although its painful putting up with Scottsdale Yoga Yenta's and there are way too many here.  Give Perk a try....super great owners!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this after reading the great reviews!  The kids and hubby loved their items.  Popular spot!  We went for late breakfast/early lunch before hitting a spring training baseball game during spring break.  I'm sure we will go back next year."}
{"text":"I tried out Perk solely based on Yelp reviews.  Overall, it did not disappoint: they give a 5-star greeting and service is solid, the facility is very clean, and the food is pretty good.    We got the 2-egg, rosemary potatoes, and toast for $4.99 and a Mediterranean omelet for $7.99 (?).  The omelet was pretty tasty!  They also claim to use local and organic ingredients!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Surprisingly spacious with a full bar and awesome breakfast cocktails. Food came out fast and was great. The rosemary potatoes are very tasty!  Definitely a place I will frequent."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelpers. Really enjoyed my meal at Perk Eatery and will return. There was really fast and friendly service, a menu that is a nice mix of classic diner fare and modern flavor combos, and you can taste the freshness in their ingredients. As mentioned in many reviews, the rosemary breakfast potatoes with the onions on top were outstanding. I was there at 1:30 pm on a Sunday and was seated right away, as the place was not very busy. When I tucked in to my food, I thought there should be a line out the door for these spuds. Would have been 5 stars but the music was just too loud for digestion, although it was a nice mix of classic rock. LOL."}
{"text":"Yet another great location for breakfast in the Valley. We decided to give this place a try because there had been so many great reviews about it. I had the Baja Omelet with no bacon.....rosemary potatoes......and multigrain wheat toast. Everything was absolutely delicious. I tried my wife's pancakes and they are the 2nd best pancakes I have ever had.....so all the reviews about the pancakes are dead on they are awesome. We will definitely be back because the service.....food.....and location are perfect. Now be advised they have a lot of organic products here.....homemade items.....and only raw sugar, splenda, and sweet and low for your coffee. That's right no white sugar which was a first for me.....LOL!!!!!! Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pumpkin pecan pancakes on the planet! They are supposed to be a daily special, but they're so popular that they've kinda become a permanent daily special. No complaints about that! Try 'em. Your tummy will thank you! One minor gripe is that the combo ( pancakes served with two eggs and choice of meat) is kinda pricy at $14. I had it today with a cup of coffee and my bill was $18.01. Not exactly a cheap breakfast for one.  The other breakfast dish that I love is The Cowboy, which are filet medallions, served with 3 eggs and toast. Steak and eggs for breakfast is one of my favorite things, and Perk Eatery does them perfectly!  At $16, they are a better value than the pumpkin pancake combo, but those pancakes...ahhhh."}
{"text":"First time here and never coming back.    With a 4 star rating and 300 reviews,  Surely the decision to come here and eat brunch was a no-brainer or so I thought.  When your server asks you if you want fruit fries or toast and you pick fruit, naturally you would expect a small cup of fresh mixed seasonal fruit.  This was NOT the case.   They gave each of us 2 small triangular paper thin pieces of watermelon that was no bigger than your index finger.  REALLY!!!  The western omelette as you can see from the picture came out extremely sandpaper dry and tough as if the Cook forgot about it or pressed it down with a spatula until all the moisture seeped out of it and left it petrified.  The Mucho Smoocho looked and tasted like it was thrown together and saturated in this horrible imitation French dressing  that tastes more like re-purposed leftover oil than anything else.  The turkey wedges (and not turkey slices) that were in the sandwich were overcooked and dry and hard as jerky.  In my opinion and from what I could see feel and taste, the cook seem to go through the motions he did not care about the food or presentation as you cannot taste of love or passion and anything.  I honestly would've been better off going to Denny's and saving some money and a stomachache."}
{"text":"Busy place but no wonder. I had the Cowboy Breakfast - 3 eggs and 2 medallions of steak that could have passed for filet mignon. I chose the fruit instead of the potatoes - trying to stay paleo don't you know - and it all was delicious.   Get your coffee fix taken care of before going there or you'll be very disappointed. It looks like coffee, but neither smells like coffee or tastes like coffee.  Oh, and if you don't mind an occasional butt in your face from an overly plump waitress serving the next table, this place is for you.  All in all, great food and great (unintended) entertainment."}
{"text":"Delicious Huevos Rancheros!  My fiancee and I decided to try this place out yesterday and ended up going back today.  Laid back vibe, great staff, and a dog friendly patio.  Definitely check this breakfast joint out!"}
{"text":"Was excited to come here after hearing about it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives, and now I have been here twice. The food is excellent and the service is fast. I ordered the Mediterranean Omelet both times and it is very good! I especially love the cucumber dill sauce on top.   The Wine Country French Toast is something I have put on my list of foods I have got to try, looks so unique!"}
{"text":"THE most amazing pancakes everrrrr! Also the border patrol omelet and everything else I've eaten is SO good! Great food!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Workers do not like to give u creamer for your coffee which comes unlimited in any other diners or restaurants you go to."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary is sooooo freaking good. I would recommend this place highly for a good brunch."}
{"text":"A great little neighborhood gem, went for breakfast Sunday morning, service was excellent, food was fresh & made to order - I almost hate for word to get out, since great breakfast spots = lines out the door in this town - but not only is this spot worth the yelp, I'd even wait in line (if I had to)."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale in vacation and wanted to eat breakfast here.  I had the special scramble of the day with chorizo, eggs, cheese and potatoes.  It was fabulous.  Chorizo had great flavor.  My wife had the breakfast sandwich with chorizo sausage and it was outstanding.  One of the best places to eat breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, no waiting. Waiter was Bob and he was so attentive it was great.  I ordered an omelet with bacon, cheese and mushrooms, potatoes and rye toast.  Everything was delicious, hot and so big I took lunch to work."}
{"text":"Perk is snuggled into a corner of a relatively quiet strip mall. The place has an excellent neighborhood feel. The staff is friendly and the food is great! The omelettes are \"egg\"cellent (see what I did there?) and the coffee is top notch. I often stop in there for a cup of joe.   While there are so many wonderful creations on the menu, I do really enjoy their chorizo. I often just add that to whatever I am eating. With so many different favorites, I am afraid to leave one out, but I do enjoy the breakfast burrito (with chorizo), the Border Patrol, Gordo and Baja Omelettes and the breakfast enchiladas. The iced tea is also good. As a diner, I appreciate the level of detail that they have put into making their decisions on quality.   Also, there is a bar with many unique and creative morning cocktail choices including a flight of champagne, the tasty Peachy Keen, the wonderful Little Miss Sunshine and my favorite, the Bloody \"Perk\"fect. A spicy Bloody Mary made with Sriracha infused vodka. It is mostly a neighborhood crowd with plenty of visitors from the neighboring resort properties, but with all of the breakfast joint options available these days, Perk has definitely become a go-to breakfast spot for me."}
{"text":"Place was good, there bloody mary was a 5 star. They have awesome service and pricing is fair. I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: buzzing, busy and talkative place, not for someone who wants a peaceful breakfast/brunch  Food choices: excellent, replete with steak, eggs, potatoes, French toast, omelets, sandwiches, soups, will not disappoint   Portion size: large, good to fill you up, you will walk out of there not feeling like you got jipped  Service: friendly, too friendly, they sometimes will join in on your conversations.  I got the cowboy dish, hearty, delicious, medium steak that gave it a good dark pink in the middle, excellent eggs just the style I want.  Suggestion: five people should not be seated in a four people table, it's just kinda uncomfortable for the fifth person.  Suggest changing some of the arrangements and make it more ergonomic for the customers.  I will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"I am a Perk fan! I have eaten here at least once a week for the past two months and have not been dissapointed.   For Breakfast you can't go wrong with with pancakes, simply amazing. My fiance loved the Fancy Pants Scramble. For those that love Brie Cheese, this one is for you.  For lunch, the best item is the grass fed beef burger with sweet potato fries. Great tasting burger and the fries are just awesome. I love the fact that they support local farmers and order grass fed beef. That is hard to find in this town, but I would gladly support any business that goes the extra mile for better ingredients. Add the always great service and this local joint a winner. If they started serving dinner, I would probably never leave."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars...it's hard to mess up breakfast food- eggs, potato's, plain pancakes and toast. They didn't fail here, but not a lot of creativity to their dishes.   Ambience: 4stars...I like the lounge area where you can wait to be seated and they have a full bar. However, overall it reminds me of a diner.   Customer Service: 1  I hate writing reviews that complain of service, however when it's bad, it needs to be heard. After we received our food, I realized it was misordered. I had a dietary restriction, and asked for my meal to be remade. The waitress said I would have to buy another dish, as it was my fault that I didn't order it right the first time. We asked for her to ask the manager, and the manager didn't even have the audacity to come and talk to us. She just said no. Wow. After our bill was paid (they never even gave us a to go box for the food that I couldn't eat but still had to pay for btw) we asked to talk to the manager who actually raised her voice and argued with us.   It's interesting to see which restaurants stay around, especially with such poor customer service.  If you do eat here, I hope you have a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"After hearing that the owners of Perk Eatery were from Michigan, I think I got my hopes up that they'd be able to make fluffy omelettes like I get back home... unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  However, I did enjoy my meal at this little locally owned restaurant.    I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).  The atmosphere was nothing special but we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  My friend had an omelette and I had a Greek Salad.  The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).  The food was good; not mindblowing, but decent.  I like the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients.  One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).  Would I return? Sure.   Am I rushing back? No, but I don't want to deter you from checking it out.  And please let me know if you are more \"perked up\" after dining at Perk than I am!"}
{"text":"Always have some good breakfast. The crowd is usually pretty big so plan to wait a little bit especially on the weekend. Just wish their coffee was as good as the meal."}
{"text":"Pleasant find, good options and on the Tripple D circuit.  We were looking for a relatively quick spot on mother's day so I scoured the attached.  Noticed good variety that would satisfy the divergent interests of my family.    My son got the enchiladas as I suspected and they were super tasty with an enchilada sauce that had a molè flare and good spice.  He was impressed even though he prefers chicken to pork.  2 enchiladas is a belly full.  Lemon curd french toast for my daughter.  She went as far as she could with them and as with the enchiladas I did my fatherly duty and tried to help them out.  I'm not a big fan of french toast or lemony food but this was really really outstanding!  My meal was their spin on  biscuits n gravy.  Very food gravy with good flavor.  It was tasty and again impossible to get close to completion.    Finally my wife had the Fancy eggs and  I didn't taste but looked great and she enjoyed as much as she could be comfy with to maintain her girlish figure... I lies.  I tasted the brie on sourdough toast with fig compote... You had me with brie."}
{"text":"We tried Perk Eatery this weekend and were very disappointed.  I was with 2 others who were also very new to AZ, so we picked the restaurant based solely on online reviews.  I was nervous upon arrived based on the 'grand opening' sign out front.  I'm not sure when Perk Eatery opened, but new places always seem to be hit or miss.  Let me say that our server was awesome.  He was very friendly and very quick.  No complaints there.  However, the food was OK at best and for 8.99 + drink a person my expectations were a bit higher.  I got the biscuits & gravy that was on special.  They were fine (I've had much better), but I did NOT enjoy the rosemary potatoes.  The rosemary was overpowering and the potatoes were mushy, not crispy.  My boyfriend got some sort of omelet and our friend had the pancakes.  None of us were thrilled... Save your money or go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago for a Smunch get together.  We had a group of about 10 spread across two tables.  This was sort of a basic breakfast/lunch place but a bit on the larger side and with lots of diners it had a good feel to it.  Service was great and they did not bat an eyelash at the few special requests made.  My first menu choice was eliminated because they did not have gravy that morning so I went with the potato pancakes.  Not impressed, they were very sweet owing to the onions chosen and were thin and burnt a bit around the edges.  The side of corned beef hash however was excellent, shaved corned beef mixed with their rosemary potatoes.  Being a half hour drive in the wrong direction I wouldn't go back on my own but I would certainly recommend it for a meeting place with somebody in the area."}
{"text":"Perk Eatery was the place picked for May's Breakfast Club UYE, and I for one was pretty excited for this! I adore Perk Eatery, haven't found a dish I didn't like. The food is great  We were a group of 14 and service was good, everyone was taken care of and coffee cups were kept filled.  Since finding this place back in Dec I have become a very big fan, and since my 1st visit they have expanded the place and took over the shop next door, and have a bar inside too, loving the new look Perk!  This time around I went with the corned beef country style hash,  its rosemary potatoes, nice thick slices of corn beef topped with melted swiss cheese and served with 2 eggs, I had scrambled and also had English muffin (you can get any kind of toast you want, but I love me some English muffins) . Other than the Breakfast Enchiladas, the corned beef hash is a favorite dish of mine! It's just sooo dang good. I love the thick slices of corned beef and country styled potatoes omg YES! I don't think I can ever have corned beef hash any other way. I've been ruined haha.   If you haven't tried the corned beef hash, you should but also everything else is delsih too! I crave the corn beef hash and the breakfast enchiladas, oh and that cilantro jalapeno sauce is amazing too, oh yes I know I will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is my new favorite breakfast spot! The staff is SO friendly, and their menu has the right balance of unique choices along with the classics. They make everything from scratch and try to use organic ingredients whenever they can. My fave breakfast dishes are the brie-fig-spinach omelet or their southwestern omelet with chorizo and jalapeno cream sauce. Average entree price is $10.  I wish I could eat there every weekend!"}
{"text":"I went a few sundays ago to grab some quick breakfast before work. I was really in the mood for a good omelet and coffee. The actual restaurant was exactly what i expected, not a cheap roadside dump but a busy sunday morning diner with some classic breakfast food. I ordered the omelet and it was an extremely generous portion. The food wasn't outstanding but wasnt bad either, really just your basic breakfast food. The service was alright, very nice but it seemed like they were very busy and not overall attentive. In the end, i wouldnt say i loved Perk, i may go back some day but I cant say i will hurry back"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood breakfast place.  Chicken on the Coup - is amazing.  Love the stuffing and gravy - and then mix in the eggs - fantastic."}
{"text":"Well, Yelp was right! This place rocks. Had a simple default omelet-bacon and cheddar. Cooked to perfection, just like you do it at home. Great ingredients are evident everywhere, even to the turbanado on the table. Rosemary red potatoes garnished with sautéed onions and a sprig of rosemary. Whole grain wheat toast , excellent. Carmen is the owner and Gina is the delightful young lady who can use your generosity!"}
{"text":"One of 4 Diner, Drives and Dives I visited this long weekend while taking in some Spring Training baseball. Service was great! Our waitress was busy, but she made us feel welcome. The food was extremely good. I recommend the Breakfast Enchiladas or the Chicken On The Coop. Great Place to meet friends for breakfast or lunch. I highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I have to say I was very impressed by this place. It is Located off the main road and I only found it because it is close to the hotel where we are staying.  Our party had the cornedbeef hash, breakfast enchiladas, sonoran kitchen sink scramble and oatmeal. We also took advantage of the bloody mary and a delicious peach cocktail. We found the enchiladas were especially good--and that is saying something coming from our party who take our mexican fare very seriously. :)  Everything was tasty, the place is very clean and organized and the staff was friendly. As former breakfast restaurant owners (all 4 of us) we give four thumbs up to this place and will gladly return."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Staff very friendly and accommodating. The chef is a super nice guy.   The food was top notch. The brandy creme sauce they use for hollandaise is outstanding.  My Irishman omelette with house made corned beef was so delicious. The pumpkin spice pancakes were incredible, great fall pancake!  Definitely recommend you come and try the food here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh. Upbeat. Staff friendly and efficient.  Food was delicious.  We had flapjacks and French Toast.   Everything on the menu is great portion and great prices. It is my new favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for the Thanksgiving Holiday and wanted an easy breakfast away from our hotel.  Perk Eatery definitely fit the bill.  Perk is a pleasant cafe serving up good breakfast and really good coffee as friendly as can be.  You'll find old standards on the menu along with some more unique options.  A lot of the menu has a southwestern bend to it.    My wife ordered a breakfast burrito that she was enamored with.  I had a Sonoran-inspired scrambled egg offering that suffered from excess moisture from the salsa, but was quite appealing.  Our son enjoyed his pancakes and toast.  I would recommend Perk to anybody.  Especially those that may have small children.  It's located in a strip mall as are most things in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast if your up North. We live in Chandler so unless we're staying at the JW Marriott we probably won't frequent this place too often. If you're lucky enough to live within 20 minutes of them you should stop reading this and just go!   Went on a Sunday morning around 9:30am. The place was full, but only a 5 minute wait. The staff was super friendly and the food comes out lightning fast. Nelli was our server and she was Perfection in Motion. Very attentive, great suggestions and kept our coffees and waters topped off during our stay.   I had the banana walnut pancakes and the wife had corned beef hash. My pancakes were just right. Warm Carmel sauce with nuts and fresh sliced bananas and for 2.00 more you can add meat and eggs. The corned beef hash was also good, but not over the top like the hot cakes.   Guy from Triple D has endorsed this place and I see why. Although I'm not a super star like him, I put my full seal of approval on this spot."}
{"text":"We LOVED our breakfast at Perk Eatery! We were seated right away on a Friday morning and our server wasn't bad, but didn't offer any recommendations. Hubby ordered an iced vanilla latte and the outlaw scramble with rosemary potatoes and I ordered the wine country French toast.   Portions were generous, but prices a little on the above average side for breakfast. It was definitely worth it though because everything was delicious from the latte down to the toast! I tried some of the outlaw scramble and potatoes and it was delicious! There wasn't that much of a spicy kick to it which I appreciated and the potatoes were crunchy and tasty. The highlight though were the Wine Country French Toast and I definitely recommend it when you visit especially if you love Brie cheese. I think it was one of the BEST French Toast I've ever had!!!   If you're in the area, you should stop by! Bill was a little over $38 excluding tip."}
{"text":"We've been going to Perk since it opened and the food is GREAT, breakfast and lunch so complaints, however yesterday we went for lunch, ordered the amazing patty melt and two cokes. Sticker shock when the bill arrived and we saw that they charge $3.29 for ONE coke? Seriously? out of a fountain? Yes you get free re-frills but how much can you drink in one seating? Be aware The four stars are for the food which is always great."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is efficient and friendly. Menu is a bit limited compared to other breakfast places, but what they do serve is delicious."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised with Perk.  It didn't take us too long to get seated on a Saturday morning, probably about 10 mins. Because we had a group of 5 which required a larger set up.   I ordered the Gordo omelet which was packed full of deliciousness. I opted for the side of fruit which was a few thin slices of watermelon and disappointed me a bit.   The rest of my table was pleased with their selections which consisted of pumpkin pancakes  (yum!), biscuits and gravy, and corned beef hash (more hash than corned beef).  Everything looked great and the portions were quite large.    I'd say it was a little overpriced for breakfast but overall it was a decent place.  The atmosphere was open, clean and bright.    I might return here if invited but have a few breakfast places I prefer more."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been amazing. There is a waitress there named Debbie & just the sweetest lady ever."}
{"text":"My recent breakfast at Perk was OK.  The food was good, but the lackluster service will make me think twice about coming back.  My mom and I both enjoyed our breakfast burritos (mine with bacon and hers with ham).  They were smaller than I anticipated, but tasted good, especially when topped with the side of cilantro jalapeno sauce.  However, our waitress was pretty brusque - no interaction at all after taking our orders.  It would have been nice if she could have managed to come by to check on us, refill our water/my mom's coffee or even make eye contact at all.  The restaurant was NOT busy - less than half of the tables were occupied.    I had to ask the hostess for both a water refill and our bill.  When our waitress finally showed up with the check, she slapped it on the table without even breaking her stride, all while looking out the window.  Hello!?  No 'thank you', or 'have a nice day'.  Eh...  I can make my own breakfast burrito, thanks."}
{"text":"This place is ALRIGHT, especially considering there are many better options nearby. I was told about this restaurant by a friend and had some high expectations on arrival. My pancakes were still uncooked on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The food was just mediocre. I could imagine it would be better if it was cooked properly, but it wasn't. Everything was pricey for the quality of the food as well. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! I really wanted a veggie hash (which wasn't on the menu) & our waitress Amanda was very accommodating! The solution was the order the breakfast veggie burrito, without the tortilla or eggs. It was amazing & the cilantro jalapeño sauce is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Perk Eatery is a cute place for brunch and lunch with a wide selection of menu items from egg dishes to sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the first time. We enjoy trying many different breakfast places around the city. Although the food was good, it took about 40 minutes to get our food. The prices were high, 33.00 for two people. Higher than any similar breakfast place we've been to. I had perk scramble, other order was 2 eggs w 2 small pancakes and one mocha.. At the end of the meal I went to the manager and expressed the length of time it took to get our breakfast even though the person next to us took half the time. She apologized but didn't offer any kind of compensation so that maybe we would want to try coming back. She blamed it on this small griddle and not having time to get the pancakes out because a lot of people were ordering pancakes. Maybe it's time to go get an electric frying pan or two."}
{"text":"Specials (pumpkin pancakes today) are great!  Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was excellent and the green iced tea was out of this world. The head chef even came out to see how everything was. Veggie omelet was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"best pancakes I've ever had. If this is your first time going there, and you like pancakes, I urge you to give them a try. It's a small place and there's often a wait to get in, but if you have the patience, it's worth the wait!  If you get the breakfast potatoes, ask for them well done. They normally come out without all the crunchy bits, which is my favorite part! LOL  My only criticism is that the place is too small, and the waits can be lengthy. But the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have not been disappointed.   I had the breakfast burrito supreme this morning and the pork was tender and flavorful.   A lot of food for nine bucks."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant every chance I get when I'm in the area! I love the atmosphere here and the staff here are awesome! If I can't make it there; then I have DoorDash deliver it to me because that is   how good there food is! I love there omelettes and The Perky turkey salad! Yum!"}
{"text":"Best food in Scottsdale with excellent consistency. I am a regular that comes every week and have yet to be disappointed"}
{"text":"One of the better breakfasts I've had in a while.  Went to Perk with some friends on a Sunday morning. We arrived around 9AM so I was not surprised that there was a wait. I don't mind waiting for a good breakfast but what I do mind is when they tell you it's going to be 10 minutes and it's really like 30. Always overestimate your wait times, people!  Anyway, onto the food. I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with slow roasted pork. It also included their rosemary potatoes and toast. OMG the pork was delicious!! It was nice and juicy and very flavorful. It came with a sauce but it was good just by itself. I wouldn't have really thought of this type of meat for breakfast but with the eggs and potatoes it was the perfect combination. The potatoes were really good too. I like my potatoes a little more \"done\" so I thought they were great although I could see how someone could consider them overcooked.  The portions were quite large and I thought the prices were fair. For five of us the bill came to around $60 and that included tip. Not bad in my opinion.  It was a little loud for conversation but to be expected at a diner on Sunday morning.   It would be great if they opened a location on the south end of town, hint hint!!"}
{"text":"If I  could give this place 10 stars, I would! Debbie, our server, was amazing! She is so classy & sweet. She just has a kind face. She gave us good recommendations & they were welcomed & appreciated.  Oh, and the food was fantastic! I had the mamba & it was delicious.  The sausage was peppery. You know how brunch isn't good reheated, well, this is...yummy! Good food, great service, and friendly faces."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Phoenix area. I normally get the Irishman omelette, it is an omelette packed with corned beef. It comes with potatoes and a side of toast. The service is always fast and the food generally congress pretty quick. It is almost always packed on the weekends but if you're solo out with your significant other, ask to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"We went there with a very large group. Usually that causes problems because we all want separate checks.  The waitress was great and handled all of it on her own. The food came out fast and was very good. One person had requested no cheese on her sandwich. There was cheese.  It was taken back and fixed very quickly. The owner himself brought it over and apologized for the mix-ups. Very good service and good food."}
{"text":"We have breakfast at Perk Eatery every time we come to Scottsdale. Service is wonderful. We got right in, but have noticed a wait most mornings.  Lots of homemade goodies. The omelettes were delicious and they keep your coffee cup filled."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint with amazing Scrambles, Omelets, Wine Country French Toast and Egg White options...  Very chill place with great service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Awesome local treasure. Food is basic but with unique twists. Always right on the mark. Very friendly staff. Cute little place come early cause it gets busy. Try the Napa salad and the Miss Jules sandwich the pinot noir onions are too die for."}
{"text":"They had a kale salad that was way to good to be a kale salad. I added chicken which was surprisingly moist and tender even though I got it to-go. Price for everything was reasonable for the amount and quality of food I received. That spikey bleach blonde haired dude from the Food Network had just done a spot there a couple days before I was there."}
{"text":"Breakfast was incredible! The waitress was nice and attentive. The crowd was very mixed. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We live near the Perk and finally decided to go there for lunch.  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwitch, which the server told me was fabulous.  It came with one small slice of cheese that was barely melted and looked like and tasted like it was from a  package of Kraft American slices. Most of the sandwitch was bread as the cheese didn't cover the slice of bread.  You can get better French fries at McDonalds.  Overall it was overpriced and certainly wasn't worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Guy Fieri had it wrong on this one. I got a Denver omelette and the eggs were rubbery and the veggies weren't sautéed. It also made my stomach upset for the rest of the day. Expensive as well due to the \"As seen on TV\" effect. It's really too bad, Id rather support Perk because it's a local business but you're honestly better off going to a U.S. Egg."}
{"text":"Sat at the counter and the manager was yelling at the help for most of our visit. For me this spoiled the experience The food was good, but I won't be going back as I like at little serentity with my food"}
{"text":"Had their chicken on the coop specialty. Really great. Who doesnt love sausage sage stuffing and gravy. Then add a couple of nice eggs and it is a great meal.  They added a bar recently it actually has a nice drink selection. I had a perky melons drink. It was sweet and a little sour and it was absolutely refreshing!! Great food grear drinks."}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork dish. Forget what it was called exactly. It didn't blow me away.  I really wish i had some of the dishes that my family had,. I probably would have given 4 stars if i did. But cause my dish just wasn't that great, we stay at 3 stars.  Would i be back? yes of course.  The place was good, service was fast, it was clean. Only thing to ask for was a better dish for me"}
{"text":"First time visitor and glad that I got to eat here. Not sure if this place is a chain, but feels like a cute local place.  Didn't realize Perk was on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Got the Cowboy scramble and it was super flavorful!  Didn't have to wait for a table which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about this place and put it on my list of breakfast places to try. Unfortunately, it isn't my new favorite breakfast spot but it is still pretty good. The location is kind of wonky and (for me) a little confusing. I almost drove past it, if my husband hadn't pointed it out. There was plenty of parking but a little bit of a wait for a table. Once we were seating, our waiter came over to take drink orders. I ordered a vanilla latte and water.  For breakfast, I ordered the caramelized banana nut French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. The French toast was good. I liked the caramelized bananas and I would definitely recommend them. Without them, the French toast was pretty average. My husband ordered an egg dish. I can't quite recall if it was a scramble or what exactly.    The atmosphere had a Cheers vibe - everyone but us felt like a regular. Our waiter chatted with almost everyone, asking about their kids, vacations, etc. This didn't impact service, as our food was quick to arrive and dirty dishes were quick to be cleaned up.   Overall, the food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The service was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Yum.  Just got back from Perk Eatery. I wanted to try it since it was new and got some pretty good reviews.  Nice, bright, clean atmosphere. Great service! Very nice and attentive.   My husband and stepson both had the Irishman omelet. They love corned beef and were delighted there was an omelet filled with it.   I had the Mediterranean omelet. So good! Tomatoes, feta, spinach, garlic and a mouthwatering dill sauce on top of it.   The rosemary potatoes that came with omelets were very tasty. Tastes fresh, not frozen. And the rosemary wasn't too overwhelming like they are in other breakfast places. (ahem- Matt's Big Breakfast)   One of our toast options was a daily special, vanilla biscuits. They were sooo good.   Portions were large, so my stepson didn't finish his plate, but my husband happily finished it for him. And I had the rest of his biscuit. :)  Slightly more expensive than the Good Egg, but 10x better in quality. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade.   Now if only they had mimosas and bloody marys..."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. ROBERT was one of the best waiters we've ever had! He knew the menu like the back of his hand and has a great sense of humor while helping us make our selections. The food was delicious, I highly recommend the blueberry pancakes and definitely an Arnold palmer"}
{"text":"Sometimes breakfast is just breakfast and then there is breakfast at a place with good food and great service and it just gets you ready to have a great day.  The staff was especially wonderful and treated our son like a rock star.   Everyone was part of the clean plate club and we'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation with my family on a Saturday morning and it was packed, we had to wait about 1/2 hour.  I ordered the wine country French toast, it has cheese on it which is different.  It was ok, it had some good flavors but I probably wouldn't order it again and I love french toast.  When we got seated it stunk really bad because of the rag they use over and over to wipe the tables with, would help to wash the rag once in awhile. even saw her cleaning the table next to use. wiping the table down and even the ketchup and salt with all the same dirty towel."}
{"text":"I got the fancy scramble with turkey and Brie, it was decent. Rosemary potatoes were good. But bf got the chicken on the coup which is the dish you should come here for. The chicken on the coup has sage stuffing, chicken, two eggs, and country gravy. I mean, come on.   The wine country french toast looked amazing, I'm getting that next time. Wine-flavored french toast with grapes and Brie? Brilliant. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Some great coffee shop/dinner food here. Really unique dishes. Owner is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I went to Perk Eatery today with a group from Meetup.  The atmosphere was good.  The service was excellent.  Our server, Debbie, was on top of everything.  We had 10 people in our group and Debbie was attentive and got everything right.  I had the potato pancakes since I have not had them in years and wanted to see if they could compare with my Moms'.  No, they didn't but then my Mom was a wonderful cook.  They were a bit greasy and there was too much of an onion taste.  Oh well.  Also while the service was great they are a little pricey.  I will probably try them again."}
{"text":"This was on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I had the pork burrito that Guy had. I was so disappointed.  The temperature of it was slightly warm at best.  It was suppose to be somewhat spicy but was very bland. It may have been better if I was able to bring it home and reheat it but I was traveling and could not do that.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"This place is just flat, frickin' outstanding! We hauled ass from LA to Scottsdale with the sole purpose of eating at Perk Eatery and we made it with about 30 minutes to spare.   I have to say, I haven't had breakfast fare at 2:30 in the afternoon but I was perfectly content with it today!  I had a waffle and an omelette. Waffle (with homemade maple syrup) was slap your momma good. The omelette was excellent also. My wife and daughter loved their food as well.  Atmosphere was a little spartan and I think we were the only ones in there but it was okay.  Our server was very nice and took good care of us!  Smiley face and a star!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pancakes I have ever had.  My wife and I have eaten breakfast here 3 times this week.  Awesome coffee,  great service."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast before a really long day of off roading because a friend said they have good serving sizes and awesome food. We were not disappointed. I can't remember the name of what I got because it's been a while, but they were pancakes or waffles with bananas and caramelized pecans. It was absolutely wonderful.  Customer service was A+; our waiter was super nice and everyone had smiles on their faces!"}
{"text":"When it comes to service at Perk Eatery, there's just one word: fast. It's like the scene in the movie \"Defending Your Life\" (I think may be the only person that remembers that early '90s comedy) when Albert Brooks orders his breakfast and the cook has it ready in an instant. The food was at our table only a few minutes after we ordered it.  The food is good, perfectly portioned, most of the menu is well priced, but it's not particularly memorable. It serves its purpose. I was filled up and ready for my day. There are a few unique looking items on the menu including Breakfast Enchiladas, Chicken on the Coup, and Wine Country French Toast. Each sounds pretty interesting, but I don't live in a world where I want to shell out $15 for breakfast unless coffee and juice are included on the bill.  One other thing that confuses me; Perk doesn't take the AmEx card that my Dad wanted to pay with. I get that it's a small local business. But if the owner is able to afford a pretty good space in a shopping center in the Kierland area, then I would think they'd be able to afford the fee of whatever card that the clientele of the area wants to use."}
{"text":"Just another safe breakfast joint. The corn beef hash wasn't the good kind from the can. And potato pancakes were good but not worth the $7."}
{"text":"A phenominal establishment with great staff and amazing eats..  We went here for a breakfast while traveling and were pleased to find an amazing menu and very welcoming environment!!  It's a gem with a fun staff.."}
{"text":"perk is great!  the food is really good and comes out fast.  the staff is the friendliest around.  there is an einstein bagel's a few doors down - why go there? honestly - i wish more people in the community supported locally owned places like this instead of chains. the money stays right here in the community instead of being shipped out of state - and god knows this state needs jobs and money!    i'd highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pumpkin pancakes EVER!  We got lucky to visit during pumpkin pancake season. We went back several times on our visit to Scottsdale.   Sadly, the pumpkin pancakes are not available on the weekends.  Plan your visit accordingly!  Staff was friendly and the place was super busy.  Looks like they are planning to expand which is clearly a necessity!!!"}
{"text":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS. We split a breakfast and glad we did.  Portions were huge. Service was fast and as polite as it gets.  Felt like we were dining in my moms house. We will make this place our regular Sunday go to place."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time based on DDD recommendation.  We had the Western Omelette, Red Wine French Toast and Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes.  The Western Omelette was very good.  The Red Wine French Toast was stuffed with Brie cheese and covered with wine-soaked cherries - it was just the right amount of sweetness with a unique taste - outstanding.  And the Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes were fluffy and light.  They tasted more like pumpkin cake, and were truly the best pancakes we have ever eaten.  The owner stopped by the table to make sure everything was perfect, and our waitress was helpful with the menu and provided great service.  5 stars, and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"5/10/12  Finally made my first visit today.  Funny- I told the greeter that I'd been waiting to try Perk for years, yet I added the bookmark just last year.  May 8, 2011, to be exact.  Anyhoo, the restaurant looked better than a roadstop diner- a lot better.  After reading a few reviews, I was expecting worse.  There were actually some nice pieces of wall art.  Overall, I liked the energy inside, even though there were only two or three other diners present at the time.    Since I'd already checked out the menu online, I had two choices in mind to try (French toast or pancakes), which would depend on what the daily/weekly special was, and what the \"nut\" was in their caramelized banana nut topping for the pancakes, French toast, and waffles.  Since the special \"for a few days\" was Pumpkin pecan pancakes and pecans were the only nuts on hand, and I've a pecan allergy, I was reduced down to the fresh berries topping, and so I ordered the French toast combo, with soft-scrambled eggs, spicy chorizo ($7.99 menu price) and a cappuccino ($2.99).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw?select=U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ#U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ  Was excited to try another organic eatery since there are only a few in town, but I'm a bit disappointed on this first visit to Perk Eatery.  The eggs were fine, and the spicy chorizo complemented them well.  (The salt in the chorizo created a nice balance with the unseasoned eggs!)  The French toast had a nice crisp to them and were not at all greasy, but I guess I was just expecting more.  It didn't have enough custard for me, and I suppose I'm used to a little bit more decadence... mascarpone cream, caramel, creme fraiche, or just plain butter, even.  At least the pancake syrup was 100% maple.  (Can't recall if it's organic, though.)  The eggs served here are local Hickman Farms cage-free, so that's a plus.  Would love to see this updated to organic in the future.  The cappuccino was made with organic Passport coffee, and it was good, but I'm not used to seeing such a stark white froth, and so thick!  No matter- I got over it  quickly.  :)  Restaurant and women's restroom were clean and organized.  Service was friendly, and I liked the frequency in which Daniel and other employees (owner/managers?) came by to check up on things.  I thought it cool that someone (he struck me as a manager, or co-manager) handed me another napkin just a couple of seconds after maple syrup dripped from my plate onto the napkin on my lap.  Good eye!  While the French toast was, to me, underwhelming, it hasn't stopped me from following Perk Eatery on Twitter to try the Lemon-ricotta pancakes when they're on special.  Note to Perk: Please update your breakfast menus to reflect the price change of the French toast combo.  A $2 upcharge for a one-person ticket is no big deal, especially if everything on the menu is organic, but I don't know if I'd be as nonchalant about it if I brought in a larger party and the ticket reflected a higher discrepancy..."}
{"text":"The Border Patrol Omelet was really good. They have a variety of Mimosas and you can create your own Mimosa Flight. Full bar and breakfast /lunch place."}
{"text":"New place - \" Perked \" up my day!    Service- walking into an empty place is never fun, but my server\"Hillary\" walked right up and told me all about the place and, although not hungry made me feel like trying it out and having a bite. She was extreamly helpful and nice. an absolute delight!  The Looks- It was slightly hard what to think , it was very nice and clean, which is so very important, although I got a cool hipster vibe  then a everyday local diner vibe. I wasnt sure how to take it. But It was sill welcoming.  Grub a dub- The menu was very nice with lots of options to choose from , the standard stuff. All the breakfast and lunch basics and a few extras. No complaints!:) My food was fast, hot and super great! I am looking forward to having a second helping soon.   Break it down Jess- Over all it being a new place still has some kinks to work out. But as far as good food and good service I highly recommend it!! I was happy to find it there really is nothing like it in the area so its a good find.They do cage free eggs and local bought items. Also organic food. (mostly) . I hope to pull up a chair next to you soon.  * I filled out a comment card and received an email regarding everything I had mentioned rather quickly. I think this shows the dedication to making every guest welcome and not only does this show in the service but in the food as well. I hope its here to stay."}
{"text":"Love the Mediterranean omelette at Perk. I usually get the skillet potatoes on the side and some wheat bread and leave feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Perk overshoots right past Perkiness and straight into impertinence...  So I hate to be the bearer of bad news when all the other reviews for this place are good, but honestly I had such an attrocious time that I have to balance the scales here a bit.  Perk is right down the street from me and has been open about 8 months. We finally tried it this morning. I am going to have a hard time being convinced to go back.  We started with high hopes that immediately got dashed at the door. Although the restaurant was about one third empty the hostess had a bit of hesitancy seating us and then put us at the one table directly in the traffic route to the bathroom. I asked to be seated citing the traffic and again she seemed hesitant as to where to put us (any of the other 10 or so empty tables would have been just fine) before seating us near the front door.  The waitress came promptly enough for our drink order. J. asked for water to start and I requested coffee.  She came back a few minutes later with 2 waters and no coffee, dropped them off very fast and took off, I assumed to grab the missing coffee...and then the wait began. I started on the water and was a little surprised that it had the distinctive Phoenix tap taste to it. After several minutes of watching the other diners get their coffee refilled J. finally and politely asked if his wife could get the coffee she ordered. The waitress responded with a very tart and sharp \"sure\" and the coffee I ordered upon walking in was served with our meal.  So, at this point I bet you are wondering about the meal...it's pretty hard to screw up bacon and eggs so that is what I usually order my first visit to a breakfast place (and I just plain like bacon and eggs). The plate arrived looking good with half the plate loaded with their signature rosemary potatoes and an english muffin. I opened my english muffin to find it warm but untoasted (yech) and sent it back...again, no apology or sympathy from the waitress, just that same smart \"sure\". As I was waiting I started on the potatoes to find that the rosemary was non existent and to be honest, at 9:30 in the morning tasted to me like they were cooked much earlier and kept warm. My english muffin at this point came back toasted so that I could enjoy that.  At no point did the waitress come back to offer to refill my coffee. Now I don't know about you, but I have certain expectations when I'm spending 10 bucks on breakfast. They're simple but consistent. Bring my coffee promptly. When a mistake is made, acknowledge it and make it right and especially if multiple mistakes, apologize. And, when all of that is not accomplished, don't try to upsell by offering a pancake for dessert.  This is truly a bummer because it is the closest real breakfast joint to my house and I was really wanting someone great to come in and earn my business....goodbye bycycling to Sunday morning goodness, I'll just continue to get in the car and drive farther for my Weekend morning fare."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents for breakfast, had never been here before. I had eggs and corn beef hash, the corned beef is actual corned beef which I was really a surprised was very good but my potatoes were still hard that I didn't eat them, my eggs were a little runny when I asked for over medium slightly undercooked. The service was good, this is one of my parents favorite spots. Myself I wouldn't drive out here for it but it wasn't bad but wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Had a great Greek salad with feta cheese here this week! Nice fresh food,  friendly service, great breakfast through lunch meighborhood eatery! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"*Food arrived freezing *Almost 30 minutes for a seat *Flies everywhere *Service was uncaring and slow. For example took us about 30 minutes to get our check *Food was pretty much Dennys with lower quality and a higher priced. First time is my last time"}
{"text":"Moved to a new neighborhood = hunt for a new breakfast spot! Thank god it didn't take long and we found this place on our first try! I had one of the breakfast burritos, girlfriend had a scramble and my roommate at the breakfast enchiladas. There was not a bite left on any of our plates - all phenomenal! We had picked it up to go so we could go watch football on our couch but it looks like they had a nice set up inside"}
{"text":"Good food nice atmosphere. Service could be a tad better/quicker. Other than that I enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Found this place on \"around me\" and we fell in love with it! The food was fantastic and our waiter, Willie, was awesome. I'm going back again on Sunday! Fresh, organic foods, and the flavors are incredible. I had the Baja omelet which consisted of grilled chicken, bacon, onions, and chili's. So good! And the homemade salsa was out of the world!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the joyful service from Debbie-what a delight! Enjoyed the Perk Scrambler and it filled me up...eggs scrambled with bacon, onion, mushrooms, roasted red peppers; comes with rosemary potoroos and chose an English Muffin. All good things from this delicious eatery!"}
{"text":"I would not go out of my way to eat here.  it was just okay...it wasn't great just okay...The veggie omelet was just okay nothing to write home about.  The pancakes are over priced for the ones you receive.  I expected them to be a bit bigger but they were much smaller than the plate and nothing great..average food for expensive prices...nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I have eaten here 4 times in 3 days, and each meal was better than the last. Cage free eggs, all natural meats, and everything made to order.  My first visit was a birthday breakfast surprise from my husband. It was late morning on a weekday, not crowded, excellent service, and the food was great. Coffee was great too, even the decaf, which to me is a sign of a place that pays attention to detail. He had the Fancy Pants Scramble and I ordered french toast with caramel-banana-pecan topping. We chatted with the owner/chef, nice guy and very committed to great customer service and quality food.  We decided to go back the next day (Saturday) to try the pumpkin pancakes, the weekend special. These were, hands down, the BEST pancakes I have ever had. Moist but not doughy, nice egg-iness, a little pecan crunch, perfectly sweet, and plenty on the plate. For a slightly healthier meal to balance it out we got egg whites and an English muffin. Fresh, hot and served just the way I asked for it.  Same day my family, visiting from out of town and hungry for lunch, requested a place that served all-natural meats. Perk Eatery, here we come! Lunch was even better than breakfast! They roast their own turkey and corned beef. The corned beef was perfectly salty and very lean without being dried out. We had corned beef ruebens, turkey ruebens, sweet potato fries, salad with goat cheese and pinot noir onions....and pumpkin pancakes for dessert. (Did I mention it was my birthday?)  Before they left for the airport the next day they begged us to go back for breakfast. Pumpkin pancakes for the table, corned beef hash with rosemary potatoes/swiss cheese/eggs, huevos rancheros, Mediterranean omelet, just a sampling of what we had. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  My only regret is not having tried this place earlier. Don't let the reasonable prices and casual decor mislead you - this is a true gem!"}
{"text":"This was our second time there - I really liked it and my husband didn't - he suspected that the menu had been changed with a decrease in choices.    Regardless, the first time there - I had the tuna fish - very good.  This most recent time - the Pete Steak sandwich - very good and a bit messy.  Service is very good and we had the same server both times - who highly recommends their pancakes - hmmm......  'FYI - if you order the lemonade - there are no free refills.  Give it a try - I would go back - without my husband though."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant because it was on a tv show and the food looked amazing. I went for breakfast and ordered the Sonoran Kitchen Sink scrabble. It was so damn good. It had3 eggs with slow roasted pork, sautéed onions, jalapeños, potatoes topped with cilantro jalapeño sauce and black beans. All the flavors that came from just one bite kept me going for more because how delicious this dish was. I'll be back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast when we stay at the Westin Kierland across the street. Open at 6:30 am! Full espresso bar choices. 3 egg omelettes w lots of savory specials (wine country French toast stuffed w Brie and topped w roasted grapes and wine rosemary syrup!) Had a very affordable $5 b-fast burrito that came w a delicious cilantro salsa (funny orangish color, but don't let that turn you off!). Food came out fast and hot. Service nice. Easy to bring our toddler. Very busy by 9am on wkday."}
{"text":"This place has literally been my favorite breakfast spot for years. Even before Guy went there ... so yah years. And it has yet to disappoint. I have tried quite a few things on the menu and everything is always great but my absolute favorite meal is the Corned Beef Hash. It's just really yummy and the corned beef isn't from a can so that's what's up!!  I also always HAVE to get a chocolate chip pancake. Like have to. It's one of those \"so good makes you want to slap yo mama\" type good. It has just the right fluff and chocolate chips. Just make sure to get you a pancake and you can thank me later :-)  It's a husband and wife that own the restaurant and supporting local is where it's at. They are awesome and even remember my name every time I go in. The servers are just as great and always take care of us!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately. Must've came at the end of the rush because the place began to thin out. Good thing we're late risers on weekends!  I can't remember what we ordered - both omelets and potatoes - but they were both really good and fulfilling. I didn't know Triple D was here, but they definitely flaunt it in the restaurant.  They forgot to bring out my girlfriend's toast, but the waiter was really nice and helpful. We were in and out pretty fast, had lots of stuff planned for the rest of the day, so we didn't bother asking or complaining about the toast at the time.  I'm not a fan of the open/cafeteria style seating, which is why it's 4-stars instead of 5. I have ADD and OCD, and I'm a former Marine, so I don't do well in open social settings. I like to spend time with my girlfriend, but I was like a dog in a squirrel forest. Too close to other people for my comfort.   However, with that said, I am a rare breed of animal and none of this bothered my better half. We both loved the food and I'll just remember to take my chill pill before we go here again, because yes, we will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I lived in Phoenix for three years and this is the best breakfast I've had hands down.  Owner always says hello and he is down to earth.  Great service every time I've been there.  Pancakes are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Perk serves up the best burger in this part of town - nice and greasy, substantial size and full of flavor.  I am in love with the pumpkin pecan pancakes I had last time - pancake batter with some pumpkin and chopped pecans mixed in.  Served up with butter and REAL MAPLE SYRUP.    They have always done a great job getting people sat as quickly as possible, when there is a wait.  Super organized and you can sit in the bar while you wait.  But the wait wasn't very long at all.  Service is very friendly and helpful about navigating the menu and your preferences/dislikes.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Watch out this place will nickel & dime you. Thought we would give this place a second shot and we totally regretted it. My son ordered the ham & cheese roll up and he asked if he could have turkey instead. They said yes for a $1 extra! Seriously.  Best marketing is word of mouth...remember that."}
{"text":"Amazing service ! The best Belgian waffles! The fancy pants scramble was delicious and also chicken on the coup! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this little place! I think I enjoy its friendly staff the most!   The food is good, limited on the non pork options, but I think I am in the minority of people who don't care for pork.   I was very pleased with the corned beef hash!. It is very hard to find homemade corned beef hash so I was delighted when I got my plate and could easily tell it wasn't from a can and tasted good.   The cappuccinos are good, most of the time, but I think some of the staff isn't sure how to use the machine.   Overall, it's a nice breakfast place."}
{"text":"We have now been to Perk three times in the last three weeks.  We eat breakfast/brunch out every day and happy to have found this restaurant.  The waite staff is great...the menu is wonderful....and the food is terrific.  Very innovative creations.  My only negative is, that I feel badly for people who come in by themself and the hostess says \"ONLY ONE\"!  It really sounds awful and not very tactful. Otherwise, a fan."}
{"text":"A little more pricey than some other breakfat joints but the big portions and waitstaff make up for that.  Everyone has a smile and very attentive.  Nice, bright and upbeat inside (despite being in a strip mall)  I agree with other reviews that the rosemary potatoes are awesome.  One word of advice save the speciality coffee drinks for starbucks and just order the old fashion kind (you know the one that comes from a pot)."}
{"text":"We had the Outlaw Scramble and the Lemon Curd French Toast.  Both were delicious if we are ever back in the area we will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Friendly staff, great service, clean and very inexpensive! We spent a week in Arizona (Scottsdale, Sedona and the Grand Canyon and  basically every morning that we were in Scottsdale we went here.   Our first day (and again on our third visit) I had the Wine Country French Toast ($11.99) that was featured on DDD. This dish was so incredible and what a deal...a huge portion of French toast stuffed with French Brie topped with roasted red grapes and red wine rosemary (trust me the flavours work!) syrup. The ingredients alone enticed me. If you look up the recipe on the food network, it uses a whole cup of Pinot noir! Needless to say, I had to come back and have it again when we got back from Sedona. My husband had the pork sandwich (8.99) with a side of delicious watermelon which he thoroughly enjoyed and ordered it again on our third trip back.  On the 2nd visit I had the chicken on the coup which is crispy sausage and sage stuffing topped with peppery sausage gravy and 2 eggs which I got over medium and they were cooked to perfection. I love my egg yolks runny but the whites cooked and these were perfect.  The gravy was a little peppery but not overly so. A delicious dish but had to go back to the French toast on the third visit. Our waitress was amazing...on our third visit we left a 20 tip on a 20 dollar bill. Everyone there is just so nice. I even saw the owner push the wheelchair of one of the customers to his car ( he was an older gentleman).   Amazing. I wish we had such a place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very very good food and service was excellent . Very clean . We got our food in less that 15 minutes , I'm coming back here for sure . walking distance from the hotel .."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for breakfast or brunch! They seat you quickly even though there is always a crowd. Outdoor and indoor seating. Great bloody's too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really have to try this place again. It's suppose to be really good and it was even on diners, drive ins, and dives.  I got the Chicken in the coupe, no chicken in this... ?? It was pretty tastey at the beginning but toward the end it just got very heavy.  I will have to come back and try the breakfast."}
{"text":"I don't have any pictures because I was mesmorized by my perfect plate of breakfast. Two sunny side up eggs with rye toast, sausage, and rosemary seasoned potatoes. Our waitress was sweet and efficient, our drinks were dropped in a timely fashion, and I just love a busy and bright atmosphere for sunday morning brunch! If you're not in the mood for eggs they also have great looking sandwiches, burgers, salads, and soup! There is a full service bar and the food came out in perfect timing! I'm so happy we found this cute and delicious ma and pop restaurant. My husband and I will be back for we have dubbed this place our new breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood place for breakfast. We walked in and was greeted right away. The service was friendly, welcoming and had a few people asking about our meal. We order and then boom, the food was at our table. Very quick.  I ordered the Irish omelet and it comes with rosemary potatoes and your choice of toast. Thought the omelet was fluffy and pretty good. I thought the amount of food was very reasonable. Not too much and not too little. My wife had the scramble eggs and fruit and just gobbled it up. I had sour dough toast and my wife had white toast. I thought the food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"THE BEST WAFFLE EVER. Honestly no other waffle compares, I'm literally still dreaming of the waffle.   SO light and airy. The fruit were extremely fresh and they didn't skimp out on the amount of fruit, love that! I can't wait to go back here! Don't miss out."}
{"text":"My favorite place!  The last time my husband and I were in Scottsdale we ate there 5 out of 6 days for breakfast and one day lunch.  We had something different every day and we were not disappointed - my favorite was the pancakes - yum!!    We always have the best service and the staff remember us when we come back in the area.  We love that, feels like home and I drink my morning tea a certain way and one waiter always remembers even if its months between visits.  I can not recommend Perk enough, food is wonderful and service is great!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My vacation girl and I had a car rental for two days, and went here for breakfast, based on my fellow Yelpers reviews.  We enjoyed our breakfast so much that we returned the next morning.  Delicious omelettes; I had the \"Border Patrol\" the first morning, and the \"Sonoma\" the next day (yes, that's enough eggs for a while!).  My favorite part was the rosemary potatoes that accompany the eggs...yummy!  Nice staff, good chow; if we lived in the area, this would be our go-to breakfast place."}
{"text":"4.5 stars if it was a choice! Food is delicious, service is friendly and courteous!  Only complaint is can hardly get the raw sugar out of the glass dispenser - sugar crystals are too big for the opening! Please do something about it :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast/lunch joint.  My son loved his enormous pancakes.  I loved the sausage that came with it.  My MIL really enjoyed the stuffing/gravy/sausage concoction.  I admit that I was jealous of her order.  I had the corned beef hash, which was ok.  Too much potato, not enough savory corned beef.  Great space and solid service."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale from out of state and looked for a place for breakfast near our condo. Lived up to it's reviews. Great food, fast service, good prices. Loved their chorizo omelette and rosemary potatoes were fantastic. Not too much rosemary and just the right amount of garlic."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal!  I had the classic French toast combo with berries and it might have been the best French toast I have ever eaten.  The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Love this little place bar on one side great patio and the dining area. Like meeting my girlfriend's there for our happy hour breakfast"}
{"text":"Saw this eatery on the Guy Fieri show . Was not disappointed at all ! Really quick service ( was right before lunch , breakfast was still being served ).  Chicken on the coup was incredible , couldn't stop eating it ! The pepper gravy was so savory , stuffing underneath was incredible !  Topped with over medium eggs , yummy"}
{"text":"They have expanded and the food was not as good as the first time that we went.  They might have been having an off day...  Worth one more try.  If the food is the same we will cross it off our list."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended. Food was very good as was the service. Had the eggs with Brie and fig jam which was very good. My boys enjoyed the chocolate chip pancakes. Casual and comfortable. Right across from Westin. Prices slightly on high side but still a good value."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is delicious - I orderd the Bahama Mama (marinated chicken with grilled pineapples and other good stuff). The chicken was moist and very flavorful. It was oozing with some special sauce that was Mmm Mmm Mmm. I didn't try the other items, but the people I was with ordered the potato pancakes, cameralized bananas (waffles and french toast) and a burger, and those items all looked delicious, too. They also raved about how tasty everything was.   The place was clean and the staff was friendly. :) I'd definitely make a 40 min drive just to eat here again. I want to try their breakfast foods!"}
{"text":"Met my sister there for late breakfast, last weekend, and I ordered an omelet, Mediterranean - very delish, along with potatoes on the side.  My sister ordered a veggie omelet, also very good.  (I forget what her side dish was..)  Service is very good, and friendly wait-staff.  Maybe a little too friendly?  Our waiter touched my sister (shoulder, back..) a bit too much for our liking.  Maybe he is a *touchy-feely* type of guy, but it was a bit overdone.  Will I be back?  Most definitely - a good value for the money..."}
{"text":"Great, quick takeout service for good breakfast burritos on a Saturday morning. The order is accurate. The food is quick. The service professional. Giving them 4 stars simply because we've never dined in and can't form a complete picture."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since they opened. Today I tried the pancakes for the first time.  I am ruined forever, no pancakes will ever live up to these. These were the greatest pancakes I've ever eaten.  I'm actively fighting off my wife from eating my pancakes"}
{"text":"We got there around 10:30 a.m. and the place was packed! I guess that's what happens when you get featured on The Food Network. We had to wait around 5 minutes (more or less) to get a seat. They had free wifi so it's aaaaall good. ;)  My husband ordered the french toast and coffee: Verdict: It's GOOD. The touch of cinnamon makes it sooo delicious. The coffee's average (he's a bit of a coffee nerd :p).  I got The Outlaw Scramble with ranch potatoes, toast, and homemade lemonade because it rhymes. Verdict: It has bacon, ham, sausage, and cheese topped with jalapeno sauce, so what's not to love?  The serving was too big for me so I shared it with my beloved other half who is more than willing to help me out - as always. He particularly liked the sausage bits.  I asked the friendly waiter why they call it \"Perk\" eatery and said it has something to do with the word \"percolate\". Too bad, I was hoping we share the same nickname.  Overall, we love this place! It's a good breakfast spot and we'll come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Breakfast places aren't abundant in 85254 land and this place is a welcome choice. Friendly staff and the chef even made rounds with the customers! The menu has the regular along with savory unusual. If you tired of McBreakfast and don't want rooty tooty then Perk is your place."}
{"text":"While staying  @ the Westin down the street and if you're looking for a yummy place for brunch or lunch this place is a total must eat at. We were there during the week so not much of a wait. Menu has many different choices or selections to choose from"}
{"text":"Really nice place to stop and get a meal. You can tell the staff really cares about customers and want you to have a nice experience.  I've had meals here before especially lunch and have loved everything. They cook the meat nice and you can tell that the kitchen is clean and sanitary. Alleluia."}
{"text":"This is a locally owned breakfast spot run by people that obviously care. I tried the country-style corned beef hash, and I'm excited to go back and sample more of their unique dishes. I with they would dim the lighting a little."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the Fam bc of the good reviews and the fact it was featured on triple D on food network.  I got the porky pig sandwich, wife got the perk scramble and the kids got the 3 pancake plate.  My sandwich was pretty good, had pulled pork and chorizo with a flavorful chipotle sauce.  There was pork and chorizo in each bite, good proportions.  The Rosemary potatoes were good too but couldn't finish them bc the sandwich was so filling.  The kids enjoyed their pancakes/eggs/bacon, pretty standard.  The weakest dish honestly was the perk scramble.  The eggs were runny and just overall lacking in flavor.  The big knock for us was the price for each dish, each dish should have been like 3-5 dollars cheaper! The place was too over priced for the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Perk used to be our favorite Breakfast spot, but I feel the Dives/Diners spot went to their heads a bit.   The Owner/Mgr. has become rude and forgot who her early customers were. Food is still good, but now feel rushed the minute we sit down and the place has lost its personality.  Perk has now become our last choice for a morning out."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast menu, good and satisfying food. But the best part is the warm service; the make you feel special! The place is nice, clean and open."}
{"text":"First impression:  A gentleman and his wife were walking up and struggling with her pushing him in a wheel chair and the gentleman at the front rushed out and took over pushing him, getting them immediately to a table on a patio.   The staff is incredibly attentive and polite. The food was very good and reasonably priced for large portions. Breakfast tacos get an A.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We went here today for the first time...We live a minute away, so we were excited to have finally went.  We also wanted this experience to be amazing... We arrived at 1:15pm on a Monday.  Lunch crowd was gone. We both liked the atmosphere, and the menu...Very excited to see some unique items on the menu.   A lady that walked in at the same time as we did, and sat right next to us, ordered and had her meal, before we were even asked for our order...Didn't care for that. When server finally came to take our order about 15 minutes in..it was clear that he did not want to be there or serve us, or both. We ordered the Turkey Ruben, I asked the young man serving us what the secret sauce on the menu was..he said just regular Ruben sauce and they serve it upon request.  I told him, that I'd like to try it. My boyfriend and I were sharing the meal and we told the server that.  We also ordered the greek salad. When the meal arrived, it was the sandwich on one plate, and the salad came out a bit later in one bowl.  He did ask if we needed anything else and we asked for two plates.  He asked if we wanted large or very small plates...smh He brought the plates and left.  The greek salad looked great...I mixed it all together and cut up the beets...Took a couple bites of the salad and realized that there was no dressing on it.  I tried getting the servers attention to no avail.. Back to the sandwich...Great Rye bread they use...really out of this world good.  There were two very thick slices of turkey on the bread, about a tablespoon of sauerkraut, maybe less.  The Ruben sauce was on the side and it was pretty decent. (not typical ruben sauce btw)  Finally got servers attention when we were done with sandwich (kinda wanted to have the salad WITH our sandwich)  I asked him for some dressing, he brought a cup of it..No apology for forgetting it, that was nice...I put it on the salad, took a few bites (was kind of over it )  It was ok...but we had to leave so we took the salad with us...It won't get eaten as we had dinner plans out...I hate wasting food, and throwing away money.  Btw,  Our waters were never refilled until he brought our bill when we were done.  Not a GREAT experience, however, having said that, we WANT the experience to be great, so we will give it one more try, as the food was decent..Service was not."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in N Scottsdale. It was featured on Triple D and I highly recommend any of the entrees that were featured on the show. I also like the \"chicken of the coup\" which consists of biscuits, gravy and eggs in a bowl. You also have to try their salsa! I have to buy a new bottle of it to take home every time we go for breakfast. Only side note- it's a little pricey for breakfast  ($10 - $15 per entree). Still worth the trip! ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Clean, classy atmosphere. A little slow service but very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place. Open for breakfast and lunch... close at 2pm. Lots of Organic meals. Steak and eggs is best I've had ( 3 petite filets) cooked to perfection.Burgers are amazing.Very friendly and attentive.Now have a bar as well."}
{"text":"Ate here 3 days in a row because the food is so good! One of several DDD places that I've eaten and this one doesn't disappoint like so many others have.  Had the Mucho Smoocho, For Petes Steak, and The Gyro. All are highly recommended and none of those were the featured DDD items. Others in our party had those items and they were excellent!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places in all of Scottsdale and Phoenix.  The food is fresh, potions are large, and a lot of variety on the menu.   The servers are awesome and attentive.  My favorites are the Diners Drivein and Duve specials! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. The service was very good. We sat outside, and the patio is right on the parking lot; not all that pleasant. We will definitely return for breakfast; excellent sounding menu. All in all a good place for breakfast or informal lunch."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this gem of a restaurant several times and I am so pleased that it is less than a mile from my house. The last time I ate there it was truly the best. I tried the Mediterranean omelet and it was so good I know I'll order it again and again. Service has always been top notch too!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go to for breakfast. It is very close to our house. We normally eat at the bar since it is usually busy and the bar moves quick. The food selection is good. I wish they had more gluten free items, but overall the food is delicious. Strongly recommend this place for breakfast. The team is always nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after driving by and deciding to give the place a shot. It's on the end of a strip mall but the actual space inside is pretty cute. There's a bar area to the right and the rest has that diner feel.   Everyone who served us was really friendly and attentive. We were greeted and seated promptly, and someone checked in on us regularly throughout the meal. Waters were filled and we were asked if we needed a box: they were on top of it and seemed to really enjoy working there.   The menu has a page for breakfast and lunch, and you can imagine what items would appear on a classic diner menu. I went with the tuna melt and my girlfriend went with the burger. We both got fries as a side, and didn't have to wait long to receive our food.   It was good but nothing super special. I would probably go with breakfast if I ever came back, I think that side of the menu had some good variety. Definitely did the job of filling us up though and the prices were reasonable. If you are in the mood for a diner style meal this place will absolutely deliver."}
{"text":"Really top notch service and hospitality. The steak medallions were good. A bit more garlicky then I needed but nonetheless quite tasty. The restaurant feels very clean as were the restrooms. Totally Professional about customizing orders in any way. All fresh, all made to your order, all good!"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about Perk, I finally made it today. The place was packed yet  the wait was minimal. The waitress came promptly to our table to get our drink order...  People came in after us and were served before us...even though we had already ordered and their order was more complex than ours. Didn't like that...made me feel awkward.  The waitress kept referring to us as \"you guys\"...that really irritated me and got old really fast after she said it five times. I was in the company of a classy 77 year old lady friend and I dot feel it is appropriate to be addressed as such in a restaurant setting...a little too casual and tacky in my taste...  I had the breakfast sandwich and my friend had a pancake and both were very tasty.  While the food was good, I am dinging two stars for service for the items stated above. Call me harsh, I disagree as I do not judge a book by its cover but more by reading the whole experience...so I would say that maybe Perk is a little overrated. They are successful and good for them!...but I would not go out of my way to have breakfast there again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service!  One of my favorite breakfast spots in the whole valley.  Get the french toast!"}
{"text":"I must admit I don't quite get Perk. I've eaten here several, actually many, times. I started as a curious DDD watcher, sharing the obligatory Wine Country French Toast. Pretty good. The favorite of our group on that first visit, however, was the rosemary breakfast potato. I was mystified, however, as to why DDD was drawn to this Scottsdale locale. Perhaps the crew wanted to stay at the Westin resort across the street.   I've returned over time with several different diners in tow, sampling pancakes... The potatoes were never again quite as good as I remembered, varying quite a bit visit to visit. Other items seemed Denny's-like. Never felt a welcoming vibe. I've lived in the Scottsdale/PV area for many years, so I'm used to \"Snotsdale\" attitude common in the area. Maybe they're just catering to DDD tourists. Hard to say.  On this day I dropped in by myself. Wanted to try their Belgian waffle, an item I'd never tried at Perk. Wanted a cup of coffee. Was seated and then waited. And waited. No coffee. No water. No welcome. That's the review I've been procrastinating about, I thought. I've been here often and still do not feel particularly welcome. At prime time. The hierarchy was all there. Not busy. I finally got up and left. No one said anything to me. Hmm. I drove down Greenway to the very non-Snotsdale Country Boys at 32nd Street. Only my second time there. They recognized me from a prior conversation, one unlike any I've ever had at Perk. They poured me coffee before I had time to open the menu. What a contrast. The 40th Street Café is another Greenway Road breakfast spot I'd recommend ahead of Perk.   Perk's food is at times interesting, perhaps more interesting than the other restaurants mentioned above, but the restaurant is missing the warmth and consistency you hope for in a neighborhood breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because of the reviews and also because they were on DDD and I gotta say I wasn't impressed. I started with a Bloody Mary which was pretty good. For my main meal I ordered the pancakes with eggs and sausage (and another Bloody Mary:) and to start off with I opted for an order of the biscuits and gravy - they should call it biscuit and gravy because we only got 1 biscuit.   Upon starting my third Bloody Mary I received my main meal and I could already tell the pancakes weren't gonna be amazing (you gotta know that I'm a pancake connoisseur, so I have high, but fair standards) and I was unfortunately correct. The pancakes were on the drier side and not fluffy at all. The sausage (which was highly recommended) had an odd taste and I did not enjoy it; the eggs were probably the best part, but you really can't screw that up.   On a lighter note, my wife enjoyed the breakfast enchiladas! They were so big you could split them with a second person.   All in all I wasn't a fan. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Tried this with my husband after church one Sunday. He had a burger and enjoyed it. I had a yogurt/fruit plate. I was disappointed.  It had a small cup of yogurt in the middle and a few blueberries, strawberries, cantelope around it. For $9. Not a deal. The next time I had the BLT and fries- they did them the way I like them- scorched hollow tubes- tortured- I want to hear them screaming from the kitchen. And they were. ;-)"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating anything from Perk and I was definitely impressed. Got a carry out breakfast order: scrambled eggs with potatoes and a order of pancakes. The food was shared so I can actually talk about both. The eggs are fresh and fluffy, the potatoes were well season and a generous portion. As for the pancakes... Delicious! I will definitely be going back to check out more items. The thing that made me like this place was now friendly and welcoming everyone was. In the short time I was in there getting the order, I was greeted by probably 80% of the staff. Made me feel very welcome and even more likely to return."}
{"text":"Was happy to discover this great spot. The owners and staff are welcoming and give Perk a 'glad you're here' vibe. I have eaten there more than a dozen times (including take-out) and have taken friends and family. Not one complaint.  Thanks Perk."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a new place to eat, decided to try something out.  Between the 2 of us that ordered, I got the bahama mama and the lady got the sonoma omelet.    I stole some of her potatoes and they were awesome. Both items had swiss cheese and they definitely know what they are doing with it. Everything else just seemed like it was missing something.  Left my cup dry of water but that is generally because I drink way more than people expect.  I'd say try it out but, it has a good atmosphere, I just have other preferences for breakfast/sandwich type food."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place since it appeared in guys dinners and dives... food is excellent, huevos rancheros and the French toast are a must try"}
{"text":"I would really give Perk a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I used to rave about this place right when they first opened but my recent visit with my dad was only sub-par. The staff is friendly and accommodating. However, we were sat down first and then a couple arrived and was seated next to us about 5-10 minutes later and their order was taken before ours and they received their food way ahead of us too. That's just me being a little picky but I was very hungry and both of us were ready to order asap.   I ordered the Bahama Mama sandwich which is a unique dish on their menu as you can't find it anywhere else. It's very yummy, I love the combo of the pineapple and special cucumber sauce. My dad ordered to eggs any style with bacon and potatoes.   I just remember the food being much more appealing back when it first opened. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was still good and the fries were very yummy but I wasn't totally WOW-ed.   I'm still going to head back on occasion when I'm in the area looking for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wow, cage free eggs? This could be pretty good right?   WRONG!   Do you have any idea how hard it is to cook eggs that are THIS BAD? Perk in Scottsdale makes it simple. First they take old eggs that were fried up yesterday and reheat them in the microwave, then, sparingly dump a few old and gross vegetable pieces inside and slather the eggs in dirty grease. Make sure to leave out any salt or spices and flavor to ensure a disgusting experience.   disgusting, greasy, flavorless, microwaved. I'm almost positive my health has been temporarily compromised by a simple omelette. I would be very embarrassed if this was my restaurant. Very, very sad, and I am entirely disgusted.   Next, these geniuses serve up a side of rosemary potatoes. This is hilarious... Large sprigs of greasy rosemary flopped on top of a pile of black potatoes. Its very clear that the owner of this restaurant just does not give a s*it.   Dear Gordon Ramsey, I have a new challenge for you. Perk Scottsdale. a disgusting mess and waste of $9 for an omelette.  Seriously. How do you f*ck up an omelette!? A Blind monkey could cook a better omelette while doing cartwheels on a space ship. Also, their plastic fork cut me. Everything just seems to be the poorest quality possible. I seriously couldn't make this stuff up.  If you're old and gross and don't care because you've completely let yourself go, this place is perfect for you, they care just as little as you do about how their food looks and tastes.  DISGUSTING! BEWARE!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Very good food and service. Very fast! We tried the chicken on the coup, potato pancakes, Belgium waffle, fries and omlete with rosemary potatoes. Everything was amazing but I'm definitely getting the chicken on the coup again!"}
{"text":"I eat here  once every week or two. Service can be spotty but all you need to do is speak up!  My omelette of choice is the Mediterranean with egg whites. The cucumber dill sauce on top is lick your plate worthy. My husband loves the mambo omelette or the burrito supreme with red sauce (the green sauce is great too).  Peak eating hours expect a wait. Owners always speak to me about my meal. Love supporting small business! Give it a try."}
{"text":"A nice breakfast option we traveled too. The place was busy, but we waited 10 quick minutes. The menu is large with some grest egg entrees, and whimsical words in the descriptions. We enjoyed huevos rancheros, the gordo omelet, and loved the biscuits & gravy. Our server Nick was super friendly and always on point with coffee refills. Overall a nice breakfast eatery and would recommend to all."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch with my mom. This place is very close to her house and she, my brother, niece, and nephew frequent Perk for breakfast. So when we went in, someone (I think the owner?) greeted us and was wearing like a checkered hat and just seemed like a generally nice guy. We were seated in the small, but comfortable dining room. I ended up ordering the napa valley salad to split with my mom and a cup of chicken noodle soup and she got eggs and potatoes. The kitchen actually split the salad into two bowls, which was a really nice touch! The salad was Ah Maze Ing! Soooo good. It has a really creamy feta, wine soaked onions, walnuts, and apples on top of spinach with a creamy balsamic dressing. I could have licked the bowl, this salad was so good. The soup was also tasty, but nothing super special. My mom's rosemary potatoes were really good, with enough seasoning to give them a tasty flavor and her eggs were cooked perfectly. I will definitely come back here again and try one of their wonderful sounding breakfast items (yesterday they had pumpkin pancakes....yum! but in the name of being 'healthy' I skipped them yesterday, and instead ate a bunch of feta cheese (ha!)....*sigh). So go here! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After reading the other yelp reviews, looking at pictures, and seeing that this place was featured on DDD, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, my experience did not come close to meeting those expectations.  To start, the tables were placed too close to each other, so we were uncomfortably close to other patrons. Second, the prices were over inflated. (Maybe they are capitalizing on DDD?) Lastly, once you do order the overpriced food it is VERY underwhelming in terms of taste, presentation, and most of all portion sizes. The picture of my girlfriend's breakfast sandwich says it all.  In conclusion, I don't recommend going to Perk Eatery. Prices are high, food is average, portions are small."}
{"text":"saw it on Triple D and since my husband works a couple of miles a way-we tried it.  what we had was good and the people were nice.  maybe we ordered the wrong items that would make it fit the 5 star category?  I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in to Perk Eatery on a Tuesday morning shortly before 8. About ¼ of the tables were filled. I was by myself. Seated and told that my waiter would be right with me. Look through the menu. Then I look around and there's lot's of Guy Fieri stuff there. They must have been on the DDD show. Ok, so now I've been there probably 7-8 minutes. Guy comes and cleans up the table next to me. I say \"Good Morning.\" He says \"Good Morning.\" Then he leaves. There appears to be some debate going on amongst the staff about who does what. Strange. I just want someone to bring me some coffee. So I wait and I wait and I wait. At 8:15 a group of 3 is seated adjacent to me and someone brings them coffee and takes their order. Seriously, even if you thought(mistakenly) that I was waiting for someone don't you think I might want something to drink. So I left without any fanfare. I was hungry but they won't get my business. Ever."}
{"text":"While I saw the Perk Eatery was showcased on Diners, Dives, and Drives Ins and since I was in AZ, I had to come check this place out.  First of all it is a cozy casual mom and pop restaurant and you will certainly find the owners working all aspects of the place.   The place has many small tables around the room, an outdoor seating area as well, and even a bar location. They basically have a good selection of beer, wine, and champagne. We went on a Saturday morning about 10:30 and it was not really busy for us.   I saw on the show an item called Wine Country French Toast and certainly had to have it. Let's just say it looked and tasted just as the TV show displaced (okay, you cant taste on TV, but you get the point)  They serve these Oregano potatoes and those are certainly a Must! A classic thing about this place is that serve only Breakfast and Lunch all day.  Also ordered the mimosa flutes which a basically pick 5 different flavors, they were great.  If I lived in the city, I would certainly be frequenting this place at least once a month and will definitely be back next time I visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype. Once again Guy Fieri has misled me. The wait was long on a Saturday AM, the food was average, and the Bloody Mary (although tasty) was overpriced. One visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great - I've had the breakfast burrito a few times and the corn beef hash last time. Large portions leaving you more than satisfied afterwards.  Service and atmosphere are so-so. Don't expect anything more than a casual breakfast with big portions of good, wholesome food."}
{"text":"It was OK... BUT...  they don't take American Express.  I realize this might sound picky... but it seemed strange that a restaurant (in a high tourist area) doesn't take AMEX - especially in this day and age.    Ok - moving on from that disappointment - the food was great.  I had a sandwich and my friend had a salad.  Both were very good and we thought nice value for the prices.  We also had GREAT coffee.  Beautifully prepared cap & latte.  The service was super friendly and accommodating.  The owner came over and chatted with us and was a really nice lady.   I love to support a local spot near my house and the food was great.  I would have given it 5 stars if they took AMEX...  I wouldn't take a crowd or have a business meeting there since I can't use my preferred credit card.  But I would go back for a quick bite with someone."}
{"text":"I try to eat here every time in town..... Had some great corned beef hash and poached eggs. As always, the food was great and the service was very good."}
{"text":"I came here once on a weekday on accident lol. I had a doctors appt a few feet away & was a lil hungover (tmi?) So I made my way over, thinking this was actually another food spot but realized too late. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and sat down right away. The service was good & my food was delicioso. It was a wonderful mistake, and the pricing was very reasonable. It's my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"The Brie turkey spinach fig compote omelet was a nice change of pace. Cool spot. Good, varied menu."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend in Scottsdale and he offered to take me out for breakfast. I'm always down for that so off we go. We were seated right away. I got the french toast with bacon, coffee and fresh squeezed OJ.   I was impressed by some of the small things. Real maple syrup for example and really good coffee. The bacon was thick cut and cooked just right. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Not too noisy with just the right amount of low key conversation.   In short, it was terrific. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"First time. Simple ham steak and eggs, over medium w/cottage cheese, wheat toast. Everything perfectly prepared; served hot...coffee superb! Pepe! Great service!"}
{"text":"We were delight to see chorizo on the menu.  They had a varied menu with many breakfast options.  My daughter's had the run for the border platter and really enjoyed it.  I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo as did my son.  Everything came out quickly and the staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"One of my wifes and my favorite breakfast joints.  You have to try the cilantro jalapeno sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Extremely homey. Guy fireri approved. This place should have all the stars."}
{"text":"While staying at the Westin, we decided to have breakfast here since it was close.  The wait for our party of 5 was about 20 minutes.  When it was our turn, the hostess called our name and so we followed her into the restaurant (we had been waiting outside)...we stood at the front area while she told us to wait just a moment as they were getting our table ready.  As we stood there for a couple of minutes, another hostess came up and pretty much scolded us telling us that we needed to wait outside instead of blocking the register area while our table was getting cleared.  That was rude.   I ordered the fancy scramble which wasn't all that fancy.  They were scrambled eggs with a slice of brie and a dollop of fig splatted on top.  I could've done that myself at home.  My BIL ordered the huevos rancheros which he stated was pretty good.  The kids had the silver dollar pancakes which they devoured.  Unfortunately I can't remember what my hubs and SIL ordered - which means it must not have been that memorable.    Our server was pretty good though and she was attentive.  Coffee and waters were refilled promptly.  I probably would not come here again unless majority ruled."}
{"text":"Perk Eatery lives up the reviews and the hype.  We drove from downtown Scottsdale  passing many great places to give this a try and was well worth it. The building is nothing to rave about, its in a strip mall and is very diner, but that is part of the charm. Great diner food with a southwest twist. Not too heavy but still plenty of bite. The DDD Guy Fiery memorabilia is fun to see."}
{"text":"Not quite as delic as Guy made it out to be but the food really is very good !!! The palo sandwich was awesome !! ... The outlaw scramble didn't live up to expectations ... Too much cheap cheese with no taste!!  Service was very average ..... It was ok but slow and just not very friendly !!   Reason i give it only 2 stars is that they don't take amex!!! I mean come on guys ;) its 2015 !!! Its a restaurant and not a cheap one for that !!! Surely u can find a way to compensate for the extra 1% it costs to use amex over visa !!!  When i see a restaurant being cheap like that out front i get scared about what corners they cut in the back !!!    Not coming back sorry"}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations 1st time coming here, was not wowed by any one thing. The Steak and Eggs with Rosemary Potatoes were good. One of the better Breakfast Steaks that I have had, expected a flat dry slab of meat but had 3 thick small pieces that were very juicy and flavorful.   Was on the list of places to try and when I heard DDD had filmed there for a future show it pushed us to go.  A few of the breakfast places in San Diego have placed high standards for us which none of the AZ breakfast restaurants have been able to match.  Service was okay, was seated by an open door which felt tike a wind tunnel."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here for 2 years and always get an amazing welcome from Pauline the owner and the amazing waitress Amanda. Food is awesome, love the service and ambiance. Totally recommend."}
