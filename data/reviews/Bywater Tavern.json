{"text":"Tonight my husband surprised me with a special night out and Bywater was the place he chose.  We started with appetizers of oysters on the half shell that were out of this world and boudin balls which were delectable.  We partnered the appetisers with hurricanes which were quite refreshing. The night was completed with shrimp po'boys my husband lived in New Orleans so he was looking forward to the familiar tastes and the chef didn't disappoint! We will definitely be going back and I highly recommend Bywater for all those looking for the taste of New Orleans."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is a hidden gem for sure.  The food is top notch and the most authentic Cajun cooking that I've had outside of the New Orleans area.  Everything is made in house and from scratch, so you have great fresh ingredients paired with the knowledge and know how to bring them together to represent NOLA here in the CLE.  The drinks are on point as well, the hurricanes are fantastic.    With that being said, a tavern is nothing without atmosphere.  This was my first time here, and the bartenders, owner, hell...even the customers that were there made it a completely inviting place.  The lighting, the decor, and the live music, which is every Saturday by the way!!!  Last but not least.  This is a great place to go for a nice little date night, cozy, not overly loud, perfect for conversations and a just all around good time."}
{"text":"Bartender was great. Until he told us they aren't serving food. At all. Except for Tuesday's, when one of the bartenders makes fajitas and brings them from home. Ordered a sazerac, and was like drinking straight bourbon. I wish the website or the yelp said that the kitchen was closed instead of saying it's going to have a new menu with daily specials after 12/14/17. Seems like a chef wanted to win some awards and then skip town."}
