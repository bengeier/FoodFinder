{"text":"You know those times when you visit a cafe or store and leave with the desire to tell everyone you meet how wonderful it is? That's how I feel about this place.

They have a great warm inviting atmosphere, and it's a cozy (i.e., kind of a small space). While there is room for about three people to sit in the window area, prepare to either stand and eat, or take a box home (or eat there, AND take a box of treats home like I did...)

The people working there are friendly and helpful, and when I walked in, all wide-eyed and overwhelmed with options, they gave me a run down of what they had and offered some recommendations. Bunner's was just all around fantastic from the start. And then... I ate one of the \"gypsy\" cookies, and I was completely sold. Oats, melty chocolate chips, dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie. I want to go back, right now, and get another one.

I should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross, and I have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease. So what I'm saying when I say this place is good, is that it's not just gluten-free good. It's actually good.

When I went in today there were cupcakes (three different kinds: vanilla, chocolate and red velvet), DONUTS, amazingly yummy cookies (gypsy cookie), freshly baked loaves of bread (which I'm kicking myself for not trying), muffins, and cookie sandwiches!

What I'm going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan (and/or gluten free) treats. While they have decent enough coffee (and Silk Soy creamer is available), I sure wouldn't mind having one of their cookies or muffins with a nice soy latte. (Of course... Crema Coffee is just across the street...)"}
{"text":"I am new to the vegan life style so you may not want to take my comments to heart!
 
Customer service was awesome!

I was very excited to try this place as I had tried other vegan bakeries but heard amazing things about this place! 

It is a very cute shop.

I had the super sonic cookie, which I found dry and kind of stale. It seems like it may have been a day old.

I had a butter tart, it was good, not amazing but good.

I also got the mac and cheese. I hate to say this but I could not even finish it. 

I am very open to trying this place again. Or any vegan bakery at that, but I do have to say that this particular time I did enjoy my treats over all."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious.  It IS pricier, but, worth it for ethically sourced and all vegan ingredients, IMO.   Also, they are a small, local operation and I like supporting that.   Anyway, if it was cheaper i'd probably be at least 50 lbs heavier, so it works out kind of nice."}
{"text":"I'm not even GF or vegan and I love this place, I gift friends cupcakes and they can't tell the difference. The cupcakes are moist and delicious! The cookie sandwiches are pretty sweet but are my guilty favourites alongside their cinnamon buns. I like to microwave the cinnamon buns for 10 seconds for a warm melty texture, but it's definitely soft and moist without heating up."}
{"text":"If you like this place, the only possible explanation is that you have never bothered to bake vegan treats yourself. This place makes it look hard.

Some of the sweets are tasty -- the ginger cookie, the butter tart, the creamie, and the brownie are all pretty good. Worth the money? Maybe, if you've grown weary of simply flushing cash down the toilet.

The savoury foods are all terrible. No matter how much I want to enjoy their pizza pocket, it will never come close to being edible. Do your wallet and your stomach a favour, and buy your vegan desserts at The Sweet Potato."}
{"text":"The cinnamon bun was hands down, the best gluten free cinnamon bun (and maybe concoction) that I have ever tasted... and this comes from someone who is an avid GF baker and has traveled to New York and London to seek out GF/vegan bakeries. It was instantly clear that these were made using yeast (opposed to the quick bread variations I've tried elsewhere) - and boy was I impressed. Despite being full, I managed to eat it all because who knows the next time I will be in Toronto. And I of course went on Amazon to pre-order the cook book so I can wow and dazzle my GF friends back at home. 

A must try treat!"}
{"text":"Thankfully I don't live close to Bunner's, I would probably go there and stuff my face with delicious brownies every day, no wonder that place is always busy. Let's just hope they're not expanding to the East side.."}
{"text":"This place is mind blowingly delicious. I've been here a few times and have tried a relatively decent selection of their items so I finally felt like I could give an accurate review. Firstly, everyone I've encountered that works at both this location and the Kensington location have been nothing short of lovely, so the staff gets a solid A+. 

As for the baked goods themselves. The cookies are so heavenly. I've tried the chocolate chunk, supersonic and the ginger molasses. All of them run about ~$2.50 a cookie but are so worth it. Flavours are spot on, texture is perfect and they are surprisingly filling. The cupcakes are also delicious. But their cakes... Let me tell you. I was lucky enough to get a cookies & cream cake for my birthday and holy crap it was so impressive. It seems a bit pricey at roughly $45 a cake but it is HUGE. It fed 3 people for 3 days and they were massive, nearly unfinishable, slices. The cake was chocolatey, the icing was rich and creamy, and the presentation itself was beautiful. Even my non vegan, carnivorous parents were impressed. 

So moral of the story is this place is a wonderful vegan candy land and I could eat one of everything on the menu. Please never stop doing you, Bunners."}
{"text":"On the expensive side for sure, but what gluten free food isn't? The cinnamon buns are SO GOOD. Always get the big ones, cos the small ones will keep you wanting more. The pumpkin scones, the coffee cakes, and chubby bunny cookies are so friggin good, Jesus. Everything is actually pretty amazing... Except I don't find their cupcakes super stellar. Those are the only things that I don't find particularly special. Their heart jam filled pop-tart pastries are soooooooooo yummy but they're also $5 a pop :( A  friendly, great bakery with a variety of awesome pastries. Give me the money and I would totally move to Canada. JUST for Bunner's."}
{"text":"The chocolate cupcake was awful tasted salty and bitter. My boyfriend also agreed that it tasted salty and with every bite it seemed like the flavours got worse. All and all was not impressed, Kelly's Bake Shoppe in Burlington is way better and the shop is also more aesthetically pleasing"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Get your buns over to BUNNERS!  G-free goodies that lasts for DAYS!!

I sampled a number of different baked good here, and took it along for a roadtrip back to DC and give it the real g-free test ... would these goodies taste good one, two, three days later??  Or like most g-free baked goods, would they get tough and cardboard-like?

I tried the donut and creme cookie sandwich on the spot ... and they were delicious, moist and sweet, without the guilt of refined sugar!  I stocked up on cookies, muffins and cupcakes for the next few days.  The different muffins were moist and delicious, and were even better when I warmed them up for breakfast and enjoyed them with tea.  The red velvet cupcake, which I ate 3 days after purchase, was still moist and very tasty.

My FAVE: the supersonic gypsy cookie! They have so many things going on including a nice hit of chocolate chip that is an awesome surprise.  They did not lose shape, moisture or flavour and were just as good as on day 1!

What makes Bunners stand out is that the offerings are more than just the cupcakes (which other g-free bakeries in the city offer, and is one of the easier g-free things to bake on your own or find)... Bunners offers a full range of other goodies and treats that are DY-NO-MITE, and that's why you'll come back here time and time again.

I am giving it a 4-star just because it's new and I'd love to wait and see how this bakery grows and develops ... things like a bit more seating, more offerings (coffee or tea to accompany your treats) but otherwise, I am a definite fan and the range of baked g-free, vegan goods are the best I've tried in the city.  Bunners is well on its' way to becoming the go-to vegan, g-free institution in TO!"}
{"text":"The best gluten free/vegan desserts in the City! I even have my non gluten free friends addicted to it!"}
{"text":"I went here in search for a gluten-free cupcake for a surprise for my friend's birthday. I was curious how they tasted so I bought one for myself. I tried the French Toast Cupcake and it was delightful. I'm not a fan of cupcakes and had quite a bit of gluten-free homemade cakes but Bunner's made me not miss any gluten products. 

They were a hit when I gave one to my friend. She said they were amazing. It's too bad the location is in the Junction since I hardly ever go there.  But if I'm desperate enough to venture west I will go to Bunner's for a treat and try the other goodies they have.

I had to restrain myself from buying brownies, cinnamon bun and donuts while I was there since I blew my budget for getting a six cupcakes.

The cupcakes were $3.50 each which I find a little pricey but that's what you get from a vegan friendly and gluten-free. It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"A quaint, quirky vegan find in the west end part of Toronto. Their deserts are to die for, but the entrees/food are a hit or miss, depending on the type of palette you like. The portobello burger was tasty! Would recommend, but only for the treats!"}
{"text":"I am neither vegan nor do I need a gluten-free diet.  I first stumbled on this place looking for a treat for my vegan, gluten allergic nephew.  What a dream!!  Everything I have tried is delicious (gypsy cookie, red velvet cupcake).

I definitely intend on grabbing treats sans nephew.  Who knew vegan dessert could be so good!"}
{"text":"Lots of good options for vegan baked goods. Have ordered 2 cakes and each time they have been squashed in the small boxes that bunners uses. Would be a 5 if I could take my cake home without having half the icing on the box."}
{"text":"AMAZING, DELICIOUS, FRIENDLY! I went there for the first time this past weekend and was SO impressed! We ended up getting lemon blueberry cornmeal muffins, creamies (\"cream\" between 2 soft and chewy chocolate cookies), a cinnamon bun and a pizza pocket. Everything was absolutely fantastic, and the woman who was working was both helpful and friendly. I ate a muffin 2 days later, and it was just as delicous as those on the first day. The cinammon bun was definitely our favorite. The majority of the time I believe I can make baked goods just as good or better than most that I have tried. This is not true of Bunners. Their goods are exceptional! I can't believe it's all vegan AND gluten free! Amazing. I am so glad I went there and can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was expecting to enjoy their baked goods even though I'm not vegan.  I might have been able to get over the rubbery texture of the cinnamon bun I purchased, but it was also stale.  I visited in the late afternoon, which I guess could explain the staleness. The service was indifferent, and the price was too high for a stale bun.  If you plan to visit, go early in the day, and maybe only go if you are vegan. I've had better gluten free treats elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is good although haven't been in a while. I think I've overdosed on their overly dense, full of agave tasting cupcakes. Sticking with Almond Butterfly these days to feed my cupcake crave. Nice vibes and amazing cupcakes."}
{"text":"Bunner's is, unfortunately, absolutely meh. It's not *bad*. Nothing I've tried at Bunner's has been terrible. But given the huge, positive buzz I'd been hearing, I've been left very disappointed. I don't think I'll be going back.

The donut was plain and boring. The savoury pocket was fine, but the pastry was far below what I would expect from a full-time bakery. (It was oily and sloppy.) I've also tried a cupcake and a butter tart, and neither earned much of a response. (Honestly, I barely remember what they taste like. But I recall being unimpressed.)

The lack of tables (and so the lack of a dine-in option) is a drag, but not the main problem. 

One bright spot: the parfait was yummy and satisfying, and well-priced. But I'm not going to head back to Bunner's just for the parfait, which could be easily and cheaply made at home.

As a vegan, I'm really happy that Bunner's is committed to not using animal products. So I don't want to be too much of a downer. But there are better vegan options in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent!
Just looking in the window at the goodies and they waved us in.
Friendly staff, excellent service and awesome peach pies!
Definitely the place to go for nut free baked goods."}
{"text":"So lately I've been attempting to be a tourist in my own city, which has mostly meant trying out lotsa new restaurants and cafes - most of which have had a healthier tilt. Now, while stuffing yourself with baked goods on a regular basis probably isn't the best idea, the idea of a vegan and gluten free bakery featuring donuts, fantastic looking cupcakes, pizza pockets, etc. definitely piqued my interest. I'd been reading reviews, looking at food photos, and hearing about this place from my friends for a bit so I decided I had to stop in as soon as possible.

As soon as I parked my bike outside, the scent of cinnamon wafted over to me and I *knew* what I had to get. Walked in, and immediately noticed the bakery is kind of a tiny place, but then my glance was immediately drawn to the wonderful looking food sitting in the display cases right in front of me. Because of this, I decided to splurge a bit and tried a few of their tasty offerings:

Pizza pocket - flaky, gooey, tomatoey, cheesy (well daiya-y, really), saucy, and full of veggies. Was gone before I knew it.

Supersonic gypsy cookie - most likely the healthiest thing I picked up, and it definitely had a wholesome vibe. Chock full of cranberries, dark chocolate, and seeds.

Cinnamon bun - one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. Ever. Moist, dense, decadent, cinnamony, sweet, creamy, perfect in every way. I was swimming in it - drowning even - and all of a sudden I had eaten the entire thing. Next time I go in, I'm going to thank them for birthing such a beautiful thing.

After eating aaaall of that, I somehow did not feel icky at all - I actually felt pretty darn energized. I figure that's how you can tell if a place uses super healthy, quality ingredients.

Best thing to do - pick up your treats and saunter over to Crema for some tasty coffee and sunny patio time. Nothing like the feeling of stuffing yourself with tasty food and sitting out in the warm sun on a beautiful Sunday."}
{"text":"I have gone to Bunners twice, and I have tried the Cinnamon Buns, Chocolate chip Cookie, French Toast cupcake, Brownie and Butter Tart. 

The cinnamon buns had a wonderful texture, and overall it was more than tolerable. I had trouble eating it all, and left about half, and shared it with my friend. It's extremely filling and decadent, you can probably share one between 2 people.

 The Butter tart was alright, it was a little runny, which didn't bother me that much, but others may find it annoying. The tarts also had raisins in it, I personally am not a fan of raisins, so this was not the best dessert for me, but it's very realistic to real butter, and kind of amazing how it's vegan.

 The French toast cupcake was my personal favorite, they kind of went overboard with the frosting, they could have used less, but it was delicious. I ate half, and saved the rest for the next day, and it was still nice and fluffy, (I kept it in the fridge). If you like cinnamon, and very sweet things, you should try this cupcake!

The chocolate chip cookie was unfortunately not life changing. I was very hungry when I had it, and it was soft, and moist, which is a big bonus in my opinion. Some people prefer crunchy cookies, if you like them crunchy, you would hate this cookie. You could taste the sugar, and it was not very well made, in that way. If you don't mind crunching on sugar, then I suppose it would be good for you, but I didn't think it was well combined into the dough. 

The Brownie didn't appeal to me either, it had a strange after taste, maybe it was just me, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. 

As far as the place itself goes, the staff are normally very friendly and welcoming. And the building is quaint and inviting. It definitely has some renovation and work to do, it looks a bit rough, and doesn't have tables and chairs to sit at, which is a bother, but otherwise the café itself is pretty ok. I am going back to try the Soft Serve vegan ice cream!"}
{"text":"My sister & I just devoured...and i mean DEVOURED!! a red velvet cupcake with what we think was cream cheese but it's dairy free.  One of the best places to buy gluten-free/dairy free baked goods in the GTA.  

I wished I lived closer so I could go there every morning and buy a cookie, cupcake, coffee, whatever.  The staff are super sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. The first two I wasn't lucky enough to get there when there were cinnamon buns left.

I ended up getting chocolate chip cookies the first time which were very good and a butter tart the second. The butter tart is amazing. I don't know how they make it taste that good without butter but it tastes just like the real thing. 

The third time I left early enough to get a cinnamon bun. It was well worth getting there early. It's better than Cinnabon and it doesn't give the same gross feeling after eating it. I think it might be the perfect cinnamon bun."}
{"text":"I LOVE BUNNER'S. The cinnamon buns and butter tarts are phenomenal. Everything I've tasted here is delicious. I love the staff and the owner's. Bunner's rules. End of story."}
{"text":"Tried some of their stuff at VegFest really enjoyed it. Then I went into the shop a little while later and the selection was super low and I was less thrilled with the food. 

Having said that, definitely want to give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Upon learning that I am gluten free, many many people have squealed \"ohmigod have you been to Bunner's?!\" So I had pretty high expectations when I visited. Perhaps that's why, although I liked Bunner's, I wasn't blown away by it. 

I had two yummy cupcakes (one of the famous red velvets and a vanilla) and both were tasty.  I also tried one of the supersonic gypsy cookies  (hearty and delicious). But I do a lot of pretty excellent gluten free baking at home, so I already know that gluten free baked goods can be delicious and moist and all sorts of other things. Perhaps that's why my socks weren't knocked off at Bunner's.

I wanted to buy a loaf of bread but they hadn't finished baking it yet, which seemed a bit peculiar, since I was there an hour after opening on a Monday morning. But whatever. 

If I ever find myself in the area again I will make a point of stopping in, and encourage all y'all who are skeptical about gf food to make the trip. It's good stuff."}
{"text":"Baked goods and pastries are fun to eat. My \"cinnamon bun\" from Bunner's wasn't. It's probably the missing gluten. It was like trying to pass off tofu as prime rib. I wanted to throw it out, but then thought of all the poor, starved looking bearded hipsters. 

But hey. If you like Bunner's, by all means. Keep eating there. This is just my opinion. Eat wherever the f**k you wanna eat."}
{"text":"Bunners is proof that vegan and gluten-free food isn't inherently subpar. I am neither vegan nor gluten-free, and I can't remember the last time I had such rich, filling dessert; I actually had to stop eating the double chocolate creamie about halfway through because it was so rich, and that NEVER happens. Bunners also sells non-dessert goods such as bread, curry patties, and pizza (not all on the same day, though). Definitely on the pricey side ($4.25/creamie, $3.25/cupcake), but totally worth it for such quality product.

Be aware that the chocolate items sells quickly; the first time I stopped by, at around 3:30 on a Thursday, they were sold out of most of their desserts. When I returned the next day at noon there was a much better selection. Crema has also started carrying some products, and I think Littlefish might as well. Great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I shopped there when going to a vegan friend's place and wanted to take something along.
My friend really liked it and it was tasty for non vegan/gluten free food, so the review and 3 stars."}
{"text":"Everyone has really covered most of what I'd like to say about Bunner's, but in a nutshell, it's fantastic! Gluten-free vegan goodies that are so good that everyone loves them, even if they aren't eating gluten-free or vegan! I've become addicted to the Supersonic Gypsies, but also love the creamies, the curry pockets and the cupcakes. 

However, I do have one specific item I'd like to mention: the bread. I've been diagnosed as sensitive to gluten for almost two years now, and have tried a lot of different gluten-free breads. Essentially, if a grocery or health food store stocks a particular brand and it is gluten-free and vegan, I've tried it. I've also tried my hand at perfecting my own bread recipe, and have tried a few different commercially prepared mixes available as well.

Bunner's bread? Beats all of them, hands down. It's not crumbly, it's not too dense, it's not heavily metallic or bean-y tasting, it holds up very well when toasted or used in a sandwich... basically, it's the perfect gluten-free, vegan bread. If you haven't tried their bread, head over and pick up a loaf!"}
{"text":"everything is amazing!  it's all delicious, but the prices are a little crazy.  i got a box of 6 doughnuts and two creamies and it was about $30!!! But they were tasty and it feels good to know I am eating baking with wholesome ingredients :) I wish they had a seating area!"}
{"text":"It's got all you need as V/GF.  Macaroons, pastries, bread, donuts are all amazing - the only challenge is making sure you get there early enough to buy them out.  

They take orders for cakes (good selection) quickly and affordably.  It's Babycakes T.O.

Cornbread and cinnamon buns please!"}
{"text":"My most favourite thing about this place is the customer service. Such a cute little spot, filled with the happiest people. I love it.
My second favourite thing is the crazy good cinnamon buns. They are the best I have ever had.
Vegan AND gluten free baking is incredibly difficult to get this tasty. I've tried baking like this myself and have never met success. 
Last Summer I did have one batch of cupcakes that were super dense, and difficult to eat, but I've been in quite a few times since and have never again had this problem.
I seriously want Bunner's to open a spot closer to downtown. The Junction is a bit of a pain to get to for me."}
{"text":"The date squares are very good.  The supersonic cookie is excellent and not in their cookbook (FYI - in case you wanted to replicate it).  I and others I know can't eat their cinnamon buns without it becoming a colon cleanse - what the heck do they put in there?  I find their cupcakes and other cookies dry and heavy.  I always considered vegan gf treats to be rich and moist - like at Hibbiscus in Kensington or the Junction Farmer's Market has a few Bakers who produce vegan gf treats.  But they have some yummy options."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Bunner's bakeshop! Everything is delicious and definitely worth the price. 
Everything is a must try for sure. 
The girls who work there are also super friendly. 
Highly recommend this gluten free vegan bakery!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Lame hours for a bakery though... Open at noon on a Sunday? C'mon you're a bakery your foods are most popular before noon on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Visited this wonderful, clean bakery on two occasions: the first was a sweets haul and the second a savoury one, with the former being a more positive experience. That is, the date squares and butter tarts, albeit overly sugary, were tasty products; however, having recently tried one of their savoury chicken pockets, I was very disappointed. At a ridiculous price point of $5, my mouth was left with lots of sodium, barely any meat, doughy pastry saturated in oil, and tummy still hungry. Take my advice and avoid their savoury pockets!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning line out the door with four employees and the newest one on cash and serving.  The other employees milling about and prepping food and signs instead of serving.  Twenty minute wait to get my order in - Not cool.  Scones are delicious while the famous cinnamon buns are just so-so.  Employees need to take some initiative and serve customers when there is a line."}
{"text":"You guys need to stop baking such delicious goodies because I can not control myself when I get in here! Most likely the best gluten and dairy free cakes and cookies. The Cinabun is a must try for anyone that goes in here. Love this place! The staff is very friendly and it feels so honey in here. Keep up the great work! Vegan and gluten free"}
{"text":"Not bad.  I don't have a lot of experience with Gluten free goods yet.  I would say this place is good but I wasn't wowed.  Definitely recommended if you are in the area but not worth a far trip.  I found the cupcakes to be a bit dry and the icing way too sweet.  Cookies are very sweet also.  This is a takeout only place."}
{"text":"I'm new to the gluten free world. Do we get a name? There are vegans...vegetarians.. what are we? glutenfreeans?

Sure, it's expensive. But their bread is so far the best gluten free bread that I've tasted. At $7, it's not something that I get every week.  And I would much rather spend a couple of extra bucks then get tasteless, processed grocery store bread. 

The cinnamon buns are huge, and filling. I usually carve them off into 4 separate pieces because they are very dense. Their patties are a welcome treat if I'm hungry for more than sweets. 

(Turns out I am always hungry for more than sweets. I have yet to visit them without getting bread, a patty AND sweets...)

No place to sit down, so we have scarfed them down sitting on a bench on the street, and in the car. 

I will probably visit them less now that I've started trying out gluten free baking. But this will be the first place I go to though if I'm lazy, or if I need to bring gluten free sweets to a party!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively every bit as good as the best non-vegan, gluten-filled bakeries I've ever been to.

Everything is delicious, but the red velvet cupcakes are what send me over the moon.  

I'm glad I don't live closer to the Junction because those cupcakes would turn me into a manatee in no time."}
{"text":"When bunners first opened I was unimpressed, but returned this month after reading about the gluten free cinnamon buns. The buns are very sweet, but I really like that. They are not cheap, but so worth it for the decadent treat they are. I am yet to bring myself to retry the double chocolate cupcake that left me so disappointed years ago, but their buns have got me singing their praises."}
{"text":"I got a \"cinnamon bun\" there. I don't know if it's the lack of gluten and butter, but the consistency was all wrong - dense and heavy, like pound cake, but not as tasty. I could barely finish it. Kind of discouraged me from going back."}
{"text":"Got to try a chocolate chip cookie and red velvet cupcake.  I'm amazed at how good the texture of their goods are as gluten-free products tend to be either extremely hard/heavy or have the consistency of sawdust.  But the cookie and cupcake that I tried were amongst the best I've ever had (so moist and tasty).  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other goodies."}
{"text":"These are the best professional gluten free tasty treats i've had outside of Babycakes NYC/LA. Bunners are pretty new in Toronto, and i've only popped in a couple of times, but they have certainly made an impression.

Bunners primarily cater to the sweet tooth crowd - cupcakes, cookies, muffins, cakes and the like. They're all a nice consistency, good flavour and not sickly sweet. I love their cinnamon donuts so, so much. Also on offer are an assortment of breads - I tried the cinnamon raisin loaf, which surprised me with how moist and bready it was. Perfect to snack on or toast up, definitely.

A recent addition are the savoury pastries - i'm sad on one visit to have missed the pizza pocket, but got to try a delicious curried chickpea one which didn't disappoint - flavourful filling and delicate flaky pastry. Plus the lovely lady behind the counter heated it up for me so I could enjoy a warm snack right away! Brilliant. 

Prices are fairly reasonable considering the product & the level of production (it's a small store, after all) - a savoury pastry, cupcake & donut came to roughly $10 including tax. Depending on what day & time you go, you may miss out on something you're looking forward to, so keep an eye on their Facebook/Twitter to see what's on offer for the day, or even give them a call to make sure.

Bunners are starting to reach out a bit (taking some of their goods to Te Aro and hopefully looking at other places), which is a great thing because it's not often I can make it to the Junction. However, even the distance I have to go and the lack of seating (a couple of cushions on a window seat) can't even make me knock off a star. Bravo Bunners!"}
{"text":"You can't tell their baked good are vegan and gluten free! 

As someone who isn't either of these things I feel like that is perhaps the highest compliment that can be paid. Substituting ingredients in cooking (especially baking!) without compromising taste and texture is seemingly impossible. But the folks at Bunner's pull it off. 

The only downside is the cost, it ain't cheap to eat vegan. But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This vegan and gluten free bakery is better than the conventional bakery's - hands down. I love the variety of items to chose from and the friendly staff! 

I love the morning glory muffins! Best morning glory muffins I have ever had! Pair this with a coffee, what a treat!"}
{"text":"I have to say Bunner's deserves 5 Stars. I have both a gluten and dairy intolerance and was pleasantly surprised that I could eat everything they sold.

I tried each of the macaroons and have to say the vanilla toasted coconut macaroon was the best one. 

I also absolutely loved their double chocolate brownie. They sell a large brownie and a bite size one, which is the same size as the macaroons. 

The macaroons with coconut look more delicious but I have to advise you to purchase the moist vanilla macaroon and the double chocolate brownie.

I will definitely make my way back to Kensington for more delicious gluten/dairy free desserts. 

It is so hard to find gluten/dairy free treats in the city and Bunner's definitely nailed it. :)"}
{"text":"I know I'm probably just going to echo the rest of these five star reviews, but Bunner's deserves it.  It's like your partner saying they already told you they loved you yesterday.  There's no such thing as too much love.

I'm not vegan, but I have vegan friends (ha...ha?) so the fact that they are vegan is an added bonus for those difficult \"where can we ALL eat\" conversations.  I was thrilled to hear that Bunner's opened, but even more thrilled when shortly after I moved to the Junction.  I can walk there!  Dreamy.  

That said, it's still worth the trip.

The bread is soft.  Excellent for sandwiches when you get it right from the oven, warm and in a paper bag.  Sigh.

And it's not just for desserts..they often have pizza pockets or some kind of savoury pocket that is great for a quick healthy bite.

My sweet staple seems to be the cinnamon buns...they are not the gooey messes I used to enjoy (for the first half hour) from Cinnabon, but they stand up pretty great. 

I'm really excited to try the \"Fauxstess\" cupcakes.  Pure nostalgia.

There is something pretty emotional about walking in, smelling the deliciousness, and knowing that I can choose anything on the menu.  If you are gluten free, you know what I'm talking about.  I almost got a little teary the first time.

The great thing is, you can bring your wheat-eating friends and they won't feel like they are making any kind of sacrifice.  This stuff is delicious.  And the staff has always been mellow, happy and kind.

This is a walk in, buy what's fresh, eat it somewhere else kind of place.  No seating, and when they run out for the day that's it.  Though sometimes they have \"day olds\" for a discounted price, which might be helpful as it is not cheap to make such heavenly things.  The cinnamon bun after tax is $5.09.

GREAT IDEA: Did you know you can get gift cards there?  Me neither, until someone gave me one for $25 bucks.  That was an awesome gift!  I stretched it out and enjoyed walking in and getting a free treat many times.  If you know someone who might like that, keep it in mind."}
{"text":"We had a custard cheesecake brought in for a team member's birthday - OMG it was soooo good! Not only was it gluten free but it was Keto, tasted too good to be true."}
{"text":"The goodies that I picked up here were really good... and not just for gluten-free and vegan baked goods.  Bunner's has figured out the chemistry for gluten-free, vegan baking.

I live close by and stopped by just after 1 pm on a Saturday to check out what they had available.  There were sugar cookies, coconut macaroons, cinnamon & sugar dusted donuts and cream-filled chocolate chip cookie sandwiches on the counter.  The sparsely filled display case held a few varieties of cupcakes and a small heart-shaped chocolate cake.  There was a lot of extra room in their display case and I imagine that one would have to stop by sooner for a better selection.

I chose to share a cookie sandwich, a chocolate cupcake, a donut and a macaroon with my husband.  Each of them tasted great.  The macaroon was sweet and flavourful, drizzled with some chocolate.  The donut was moist and not too sweet.  The cupcake was rich and chocolaty and the chocolate-covered strawberry that topped it was an added bonus to the icing.  Overall, the cookie sandwich was good, but we found both the cookie and the cream filling a little too rich and sugary.

I thought that the items were a bit pricey (although I do understand that this is the norm for gluten-free & vegan ingredients) and they could have had a better selection for the time of day that I went in on Saturday.  The shop itself is small and pretty basic.  There is a bit of space at the front, but I likely wouldn't stay there and eat the treats I've just purchased.

I will definitely come back to this bakery and recommend that anyone with a sweet tooth try it out, not just those with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I have had a selection of vegan desserts before and majority of the time, they're overly sweet, the cupcake/cookie isn't doughy (maybe that was the intention) and therefore not my cup of tea. I got the red velvet cupcake here for $5.10 (they sell day old cupcakes for $3.00) and it was delicious. Not too sweet and the cupcake tasted delicious. They are also gluten free so I am not sure which flour they use but that flour works great. The cupcake and the icing complimented each other very well.

Note: Their ice cream machine broke."}
{"text":"I visited Bunner's Bake Shop recently and absolutely fell in love with the bakery. Not only were the baked goodies made by hand, and with love in the shop itself, all of the baking is 100% vegan and gluten free. It's hard to believe that something so delicious could be so healthy as well : ) Love the decor of the bakery, as well as they owners....you can't find a more inspiring, creative or down to earth couple. 

If you live in Toronto, or are passing through....definitely make sure to visit Bunner's, who knew decadent baking could be so healthy!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review: 

I was given a few treats from here by someone, so I can't review cost or service. They got me a couple of cupcakes and a butter tart. I didn't realize this bakery was not only gluten-free (which I am) but also vegan (which I'm not), so at first I was weirded out by the texture of some of the items. Because there is no dairy they substitute with other ingredients, which unfortunately are things I'm allergic to. The cupcakes gave me serious digestive issues, but the butter tart was my heaven. No allergic reaction and it was DE-LICIOUS. It was a bit greasy though, but considering I hadn't eaten a butter tart in years, I wasn't going to be picky. 

Overall if you have additional allergies or aren't willing to give up dairy in your baked goods, this may not be the place for you. If you are vegan and gluten-free then this is right up your alley. 

TL;DR not great if you have other allergies in addition to being gluten-free"}
{"text":"Awesome baking! Im not vegan or vegetarian and dont have allergies, I buy stuff from Bunners becuase its very good quality and well made. Better than any conventional bakery out there.

Love the seet potato, chocolate chip muffins. My wife loves the red velvet cupcakes.

A friendly and nice place that may not have the most extensive selection, however what they do have is always very good."}
{"text":"I am not a big gluten free person but this gluten free bakery is worth the visit.

If I had to choose the best cinnamon bun in the city I would stick with Cinnabun, that said for gluten free, Bunner's cinnamon bun is impressive. 

The raspberry crumble is not too shabby either."}
{"text":"I feel like I may have fallen in love...it is a bad kind of love, the kind of love that my personal trainer and nutritionist will hate me for.

Having been meaning to make the journey to Bunners (a 50 min TTC journey) for quite some time, I decided Thanksgiving would be the most ideal time. i had reordered the gluten free pumpkin pie and stuffing. 

I am not vegan but am gluten free, my plan was to not linger for too long in this shop as I knew it would be disastrous...and that it was. 

My personal favourites a re the strawberry cupcake and the cinnamon bun. The bun is perfection; gooey, sticky, sweet...who knew gluten free buns could actually taste better that their gluten laden sisters! 

For anyone reading this who is gluten free and has experienced the 'joy' of sampling many gluten free breads to find them to be much of the same and generally disgusting...look no further friend.  Bunner's Gluten free, vegan bread is out of this world. I will most certainly become a frequent visitor.

Staff are friendly, shop is clean and busy!"}
{"text":"I love this place!
I meant to take a picture of the red velvet cupcake, but it didnt make it! It tasted so chocolaty and yummy. Additionally it didn't give me a sugar rush like a lot of 'normal' sweet do! 

So majority of reviews I see that are less than 4 stars are from ppl who maybe arent gluten free or maybe are vegan... *shrug*. HOWEVER I am both some days and a gem like this is hard to find!

Not sure what the schedule is for the coconut carrot cake or the vegan pizza puff, but I am sleeping outside waiting for them!

Bless yous. Please give me all your recipes (scratch that - im too lazy to make them myself!) ...Please move next door to me!

Sincerely, Serious obsessed fan!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but I just cannot afford it. 

Their gluten free breads are the best I've ever had. It's fluffy, and tastes better than regular breads. But it will also cost you $7 a loaf! 

Pastries, they have cookies, brownie, tarts and cinnimon rolls (all vegan and gluten free). The Cinnimon roll is excellent. Also $5, but large enough to last you a few days. I made the mistake of eating it all myself. Yum. 

I also bought cupcakes here. I think some were better than others. Around Christmas time, I bought the Lemon Gingerbread, which was topped with a lemony frosting. It was really moist, and flavourful, but not overpowering that my friend who hates lemon stuff really liked it. But then we also got the chocolate cupcakes, which really had no chocolate taste, and was dry and little bland. Each was large size and about $3 each. 

There is something about Gluten Free baking that gives the cake a more density without being heavy. It depends on the type of flour they use, and they told me that they experiment with different recipes."}
{"text":"Yayyyy gluten-free and vegan! So much fun! 
I have had a GF/V cinnamon bun (good), a GF/V morning glory muffin (good), and vegan (but not GF) cupcakes (also good, but maybe a little too sweet), and (clearly) loved them all! I can't wait to try more of their things like pies and brownies and cookies!!! 
See ya soon Bunner's!"}
{"text":"As an East-ender, I made a special trip to Bunner's around Easter time.  Having recently been instructed to avoid gluten and dairy, I was left searching for a snack that I could eat without worry.  After a couple recommendations, this seemed like the place to be.

Once I got there, I decided to try a cupcake before I made any major purchases.  The woman ahead of me bought he last lemon cupcake (so sad), so I was left with the choice of chocolate, red velvet, or vanilla.  I chose vanilla.

The icing is heavenly.  How they make an incredibly edible dairy-free icing is beyond me.  It was worth the trip for the icing alone, and I could have eaten an entire tub of it.  I wish I could say the same about the rest of the cupcake.

I guess I'm reluctant to really hunker down and enjoy gluten-free treats.  I can't help but compare them to the soft, moist, gluten-laden treats of my past.  The cupcake was incredibly dense, an unfortunate side-effect of gluten-free flours, and made my stomach feel heavy.  To me, it felt like eating a muffin smothered in awesome icing.  It just didn't have the right about of sweetness to fill the cupcake-shaped hole in my heart.  I think in the future I would skip the regular-sized cupcake and go for the little cupcakes.  Less cake, more icing.

Since it was Easter time, I also tried the vegan creme eggs, which were out of this world.  I don't know how they did it, but they made me enjoy something made with dark chocolate.  Good on you, Bunners.

I want to rave about this place and scream praises from the rooftops, because I really appreciate a bakery that strives to meet really specific dietary requirements, but after hearing so many recommendations and going in with certain expectations, I was left slightly underwhelmed.

I'd stop in again, but only if I was already in the area."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am not vegan nor am I gluten intolerant. I don't generally buy vegan/gluten free baked goods, so I guess it's possible that Bunner's might be better than other vegan/gluten free baked goods. 

I only went once and I won't be back, because I didn't enjoy my purchases at all. And that is saying a lot coming from me, because I am a fiend for baked goods. I kept hearing about this amazing cinnamon bun that is supposed to be superior even despite the restricted ingredients. Personally, I thought it was terrible. It cost nearly $5 and I actually threw it in the trash. It was solid as a brick, and the cinnamon sugar glaze was somehow more slimy than sticky. The icing had a weird texture and an oily taste. There was nothing redeeming about it. I also had a raspberry crumble square that was oddly salty and had a disappointing texture that crumbled and didn't hold together.

I keep hearing how amazing Bunner's is and how it's winning the hearts of everyone even if you aren't vegan or gluten intolerant. Sadly, that wasn't my experience. 

I realize it's great that places like this exist for people who are strict vegans or who suffer from celiac disease. But after this experience, I sure do appreciate gluten and the contributions of our cow and chicken friends."}
{"text":"i went to this place with my mom ( who is gluten free and dairy free) today for the first time and thought to my self... wow its really small..

other than that no complaints..

i got a vanilla cupcake and it was definitely worth the 3 something it cost. its not like a typical cupcake where its moist and fluffy. its more dense like a muffin. but i find it works with the not-overly sweet icing.

would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I passed Michelle G's review on to a friend, who, like me, can't eat gluten. Then to my surprise she brought Bunners cupcakes into the office for my birthday today. These just might be the very best cupcakes I've ever had. Everyone in the office adored them and I called them right away to order some for my birthday brunch tomorrow.

The best thing about the cupcakes it that you would never guess they were anything but the best dairy/gluten/refined-sugar laden treats.It's really quite remarkable. I see on their website that they also do custom mini-cupcakes and cakes. Definitely worth the trek to the junction if you're not from that neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I managed to miss the gluten free, vegan, dairy free,  flavour free description when I searched for nearby bakeries. 

Obviously everything tasted like sand ( I got a buttertart and apple cupcake) 

Why did the frosting have to taste like sand? There's no animal in frosting, there's no wheat in frosting, so why did it have to be tampered with?  It's like someone created the frosting and said, naw naw b needs more sand.

Everything is very pricey because it's vegan or special or made without delicious ingredients...this solidifies why I couldn't become a vegan. Not when it comes to dessert. BUN THAT. 
3 stars"}
{"text":"I went to Bunner's Bake Shop because like a zombie sustained by butter tarts, BlogTO told me it had one of the best tarts in town*. Well actually, I was in the area incidentally, so why not? I knew nothing else about this Junction bakery--I love going to places serendipitously blind. 

Upon arrival, besides the cute cartoony storefront, I learned that Bunner's (a name that kind of reminds me of a Pokémon--the cartoony front doesn't help) does only gluten-free AND vegan-friendly goodies. It is so far the only bakery in Toronto that does both AND only both.

Wait a minute, does that mean I'm about to eat what amounts to BUTTERLESS butter tarts?! How does that work out?

Not so bad actually. It has the visual texture of a high quality bakery butter tart, and taste a tad better than the best supermarket tarts, without being overly sweet. The filling is a bit runny, which I don't like. And it has raisins, which I don't mind but others will. A decent good pass, as in, \"I can't believe it's not butter.\"

And I stared at their cupcakes and other treats, wondering what on earth gluten-free vegan cupcakes are like. Really, Steve?

The cupcakes ($3-4 for fresh ones; $2.5 for day-olds) leaves something more to be desired of a cupcake. Beer and bacon is an interesting flavour for a place like this; it is heavy on simulated bacon flavours, and topped with what I like to call \"mystery meat\" (simulated bacon bits made of coconut). Interesting. The cake base held together well with some damp softness. But what peeved me was how oily the cupcakes were. 

You can definitely though taste the passion of this business. Watching the bakers at work behind the counter of this tiny shop (forget about eating in; this is all takeout), they are filling a market void in the city, where those glad a bakery like Bunner's exist can finally have their cake and eat it too. I am not a vegan nor buy into the gluten-free diet thing, so the \"OMG! Vegan! Gluten-free!\" craze doesn't faze me, but for the most part for me food is food. I do know people suffering from celiac disease though, and they could care less about the consequences the moment a cupcake of any origin is shown in their face. Probably because they never heard of Bunner's. What would they think if they did? And while I don't profess to be an expert on gluten-free food either (hell, I know nothing), I have been warned that gluten-free (and to mix that with veganism?!) grub tend to taste bland. Bunner's not completely tasteless, thank goodness, but they certainly are not perfect either (as I wipe way all this oil coming off from the cupcakes).

Maybe if I'm around next time I will be sure to try other goodies they are raved by many to excel at. Like their cinnamon buns--also declared one of the best by BlogTO**.

{TTC: the 30 or 40 bus to Dundas/Quebec will get you here. You're very welcome.}

{"text":"I look forward to the day when Ashley Wittig and Kevin McAllister, Bunner's owners, open a location in Vancouver. 

I look forward to the days when I can get to Toronto to stock up on Supersonic Gypsy cookies and those amazing Chocolate Chip Creamies. Bunners is my go to for yummy treats and I'm not even a vegan! 

Yummers!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm grateful that a place like this exists for people like me, with dietary restrictions. While it is a bit expensive (I spent about $10 on two items), I understand the reason for the cost and I appreciate that a place like this exists for people who eat vegan gluten-free. 

I tried the cinnamon bun and the red velvet cupcake. I got the cinammon bun in the evening, which is not the right time to get it apparently, as it was dry. They are baked fresh every morning, so if you try it, try it then. The red velvet cupcake, however, was amazing and I would definitely get it again. I wolfed it down as I hadn't eaten any baked goods since I decided to eat gluten free. It was like heaven.

Thanks to Bunners for keeping those of us with dietary restrictions in mind :)

UPDATE: Their muffins are amazing!! A++"}
{"text":"1- Strawberry cream cheese cinnamon cake. Cream cheese strawberry frosting was ok but nothing that would make me come back.The actual cinnamon bun/cake tasted like it was under bakes and heavy. 

2- chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting. So greasy !!! My lips felt like a just applied a fresh coat of the MAC Lip Glass Gloss. The frosting tastes stale like \"fridge taste\". I just paid 8.48 for crap and the \"packaging\" it's like they don't care. 


If u want to really enjoy amazing strawberry soft cream  top vanilla cupcake that will blow ur mind and taste better than any non vegan cupcake out there.... If u want to show off or convert a non vegan take them to the Danish Vegan Bakery. Everything from the packaging to the cute shop, to the welcoming attentive vibe to their prices, flavours And freshness. Go to the Vegan Danish Bakery.Their products will have u like this emoji ="}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up a selection of gluten-free treats for girls night.... The place is cute and the service was great! I grabbed a couple of whoppie pies, a couple of cupcakes, and a couple of cookies. Everything was ok tasting, but I just didn't think any of it was very good. My friends (including the gluten free girl) also thought things were ok, but a little \"off\" tasting. Cupcakes had an odd salty flavour to them? Whoopie pies were a little dry and tough. Overall, not bad, but definitely not all that great. But hey, if it works for the gluten intolerant, alright! :)"}
{"text":"I believe in the concept of Bunners, and although I'm not vegan or live a gluten free lifestyle, I still appreciate innovative and healthy food. I REALLY want to like this place- it is cute and the staff are friendly and it adds to the overall \"charm\" of The Junction but- the two things I've had just have not delivered. The Red Velvet was dense and lacked richness- (it tasted  \"soya-ish\")  to me, and the cinnamon bun was pretty dry and dense  also :(    Maybe third time's a charm?"}
{"text":"There are a couple of items that are quite tasty (the double chocolate muffins and vegan ice cream) but the majority of the baked goods are meh and it's SO expensive. I am a veg so I'm used to veg bakeries hiking up the prices... But come on!  PLUS they don't open until 10 AM!  What bakery doesn't open until 10?!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bunners on a regular basis for the last 2 years, I have food allergies so finding them was great, they make great products. But the reason I'm giving them 1 star is because their customer service sucks. 

Right now they are really popular with the hipster douche bag crowd and so I'm sure they are making a lot of money because of it. But when you ignore your regular customers your business won't last for ever. It has happen to me on several occasions where I've gone into the bakery waiting to be served and someone walks in after me and gets served right away. I know they take orders in advance and people come in to pick those up, I understand that. But someone walks in and you are standing less than three feet from the cashier and she totally ignores you and takes the next persons order, just pisses me off and it takes everything I have to hold my anger back and walk out. Other times I have gone in and they are busy, they have one person working cash and people waiting to order and they have staff in the back chatting it up or looking at their cell phones texting ignoring the fact that the person up front needs help.

Bunners your not the only game in town, I will never spend my money there ever again."}
{"text":"Great treats!
My strawberry cupcake was delicious but my cinnamon buns were a bit dry and stale. This is my fault for buying them fifteen minutes before the store closed. Gypsy cookies were yummy! Great service and I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good bakery! I had the brownie bite and it was so cute. It was rich, chewy and chocolaty. I also tasted the Supersonic cookie which had dried cranberries, seeds, and dark chocolate. It was a little crunchy, a little chewy, semi-sweet and really delicious. It was a pretty unique cookie, you could almost eat it as a granola bar rather than a dessert.

Unique place, I would come back!"}
{"text":"I tried their red velvet cupcake. The cake was moist with a clean chocolate flavor that wasn't too bitter. The frosting was sweet but in a way that complimented the richness of the cake. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan. I have friends who are and I dine out with them. 

I heard about this place so finally got around trying it. The only thing i would return would be for the muffins. Not a fan of their cinnamon buns nor cupcakes. 

I've had Babycakes in Nyc for years now i guess. Rather save my calories for my trip out there. I've had the occasional vegan cupcakes in the city too. 

I'm happy you have a good local following, just not for me. 

If i come by with friends another time, i'll still grab a muffin and try their savory goods!"}
{"text":"*Updated Review*

I'm gluten intolerant and picked up a few things for me and my sister on a Sunday morning strolls. Owners don't seem in much of a good mood but that's ok. 

The cupcakes are dense, taste full of sugar, the icing piled high a top excited me but was the worst part, and tasted full of sugar. They were actually one of the worst cupcakes I've had. Couldn't eat a full one. I tried their stuff multiple times now even the cinnamon buns, but it's all too sugary! Also, expensive and I end up throwing it out. People I got to try it didn't like it. It was very filling so it might make the $4 or so each worth it. My sugar CRAZED little sister even says it tastes too sugary and immediately throws part of it out, when usually you can't pry desserts from her hands.

If you're vegan, you might need GF + Vegan combo. But if you're just GF getting a single treat for yourself might be convenient, but honestly grocery store grade is just as good as this place. When I want custom baked GF goods I go to another bakery."}
{"text":"I visited this place once to try the famous cinnamon buns. The buns did not disappoint but the cashier who was working this Sunday did not appear overly enthusiastic. As good as the treats are the absence of friendly service will likely make me consider other gluten free bakeries closer to home."}
{"text":"I used to live 10 min walk from Bunners and would often walk-by on my way to the park or while grocery shopping.  Bunners is Vegan and Gluten Free, I often bake at home and I'm not gluten-sensitive so I didn't really have a reason to shop there until someone suggested I try their bread.  I bought the three seed bread and it was very tasty but very expensive, even for GF, vegan bread.  I tried a red velvet cupcake, it was very good but afterwards I felt like I ate a bucket-full of sugar :)
I still think this is a great business and serves a specific need, try it at least once! 
If you're ever in Kensington in the Summer, go to the Bunners location there for the best vegan soft serve ever :)"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! I'm not sure what sort of bewitchery they placed on these baked goods, but I'm definitely not going to complain about it.

When I first learned of this place my first thought was \"Muffins. Need. Muffins.\" So I stopped in and to my chagrin, they were out of muffins. Such a set back could ruin ones day, but as luck would have it, I was introduced to the wonderful Supersonic Gypsy. This delicious little guy not only satisfied my Muffin craving, but was reasonably priced as well. I was hooked.

Before leaving for my next trip to Bunner's the only thought in my head was \"Supersonic Gypsy. Need. Supersonic Gypsy.\" (I'm aware that my thoughts aren't that complicated). And guess what they were out of? Supersonic Gypsy's... of course. There's no coming back from this, this is the worst day of my life, or at least I thought, until.... the Pizza Pocket! Tasty pizza deliciousness with my favourite, Daiya cheese.

Third times a charm, right? So for my third visit I'm sure you can imagine what I was thinking, \"Pizza Pocket. Need. Pizza Pocket\". Obviously, sold out. I'm a simple man, with simple needs, and all I wanted was some more Pizza Pockets dammit! Wait, what's all this about a Breakfast Pocket now? Scrambled tofu in warm flaky goodness, and also with Daiya? Oh, I can't stay mad at you Bunner's. 

In the words of my good friend Mick Jagger, \"You can't always get want you want, but sometimes, you get what you need.\" That's how I feel about Bunner's. Each visit is a new adventure, and in all seriousness, this place is great, the food is terrific, and everyone that works there is super nice. Still no muffins, but that just means I'll have to go back again I guess."}
{"text":"This vegan bakery has provided me with all the dairy and egg free treats I've come to need over the past couple of years.  Their treats are just as delicious as any place that uses eggs and milk - so why not go in and try it for yourself?

Their cupcakes are a tasty treat.  Their cinnamon bun is delightful.  Just don't expect that vegan means healthy.  These treats are chocked full of all the tasty calories you've come to expect and desire!"}
{"text":"Their cinnamon buns are huge and best shared - impressive for gluten-free, I could hardly taste the difference. It was a bit heavy, though, and I wish I got a cookie instead. I'm not gluten-free, and I don't see why this is a must go place for non gluten-free people, you could probably find better quality and less heavy baked goods somewhere else. The store was extremely humid inside, I don't know how the staff handles being in there all day."}
{"text":"This place has no seating inside, so keep that in mind if you want to devour your stash on the spot. I tried the lemon cupcake and cinnamon bun and I think the cinnamon bun was a clear winner. I didn't feel sick afterwards, which is often the case when I OD on sweets. I think the quality of the ingredients might have something to do with that.

The texture of both was slightly more dense than gluten-containing baked goods, but  I know from experience how hard it is to achieve that light cupcake texture without gluten-containing flour. Still very good!"}
{"text":"I've tried stuff from Bunner's a couple different times, and I always like it well enough, but it wasn't great. Honestly, compared to other vegan bake shop's in Toronto, I feel like it isn't at the same level. It is cool that it is entirely gluten free. I'll probably go again when I'm in the neighbourhood, but it's not my favourite."}
{"text":"If you're vegan or have gluten issues this is  the best place in the city to get baked goods.

If you're not vegan or have no problems handling gluten so what? This is STILL one of the best places in the city to get baked goods."}
{"text":"This location was a little but closer to home and in a less busy area, and it's amazing that the treats tasted just as good as the other location. It is always great to see consistency. 

Bunners is quite pricey but worth the drive and the money. The brownies rich and moist with just the right amount of chocolate lyrics goodness. The butter tart still quite amazing. I would definitely recommend bunners because I can't get enough!:) please open up a location in every city of the GTA:)"}
{"text":"I can't give a totally accurate review because I haven't visited bunners - but my friend who lives in the junction brought me several items to try. Keep that in mind while reading please :) 

So my friend picked me up a loaf of bread, a chocolate cupcake and a cookie sandwich. 
The bread was great! Super tasty and I really enjoyed eating it. Downside? After a few days it got REALLY hard and so about half went in the trash. Next time I'd freeze it sliced up (which I do believe they suggest)

The chocolate cupcake was meh. The icing was great but the cake itself was dry and crumbly. Made a huge mess trying to eat that thing! 

The cookie sandwich was two chocolate chip cookies with a cream filling in between. The cookies were pretty good - nice flavor to them, but the cream was dry and tasted kind of funky. 

So a few things to note - these items were all gluten free and vegan. I can make really great gluten free baked goods that are soft and not crumbly but once you take away the eggs and dairy it probably gets a lot more complicated. Despite not really enjoying the bulk of what I tried, that wouldn't actually deter me from trying more (or going to the actual location). They have a huge amount of choices (though from what I understand, what they have varies on a daily basis) and I think they've probably got some real gems in there."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for the first time today.
I got a gypsy cookie, which is so my kind of cookie, it was delicious.
We also picked up a couple of Creamies. All I can say is ....damn! So good. I have a sweet tooth and I could not eat a whole one. Which is good cause now I have a few bites for late.
I had a sample of some raison type bread and it was nice too.
Can't wait to go back and try other items.
Congrats to the owners."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bunner's! 

I have a wonderful friend who is vegan. She knows that I have a fondness for bakeries and cinnamon buns. She suggested this place. I was not disappointed. 

I hauled a bunch of different cupcakes and cinnamon buns during my first visit. Everything tasted so fresh, moist, and flavourful. Nothing is overly sweet, which is perfect. 

The next time I had something from Bunner's was at Vegetarian Fest. Again, the cupcakes were consistent and yummy. 

Finally, I went there before Christmas. The eggnog and vanilla cupcakes are insanely delicious! I also had the veggie pot pie that looks like a Jamaican patty, except that it is filled with vegetable goodness and is flaky. 

I love everything in this bakery. We need one in Markham, but I am happy to make the trip to the Junction for my baked good fix."}
{"text":"Their cinnamon bun was out-of-this-world!!!!!

They are pretty dense, but man oh man soooooo filling and scrumptious. I love coming down to Kensington market and being able to pop in and grab a treat. 

Hands Down a MUST GO! You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm an \"East side\" girl and admittedly am lazy as eff when it comes to trekking anywhere west of Dufferin, so I'm lucky to have generous foodie friends  who always make a point to bring me goodies all the way from out west at Bunner's.   

I've only tried a couple of Bunner's items but have to say for
 gluten free/vegan baked goods it's pretty damn good!  I wasn't too keen on the Gypsy cookie, but truthfully I am never a fan of oats/seeds/dry fruit in cookies as it screams glorified granola bar to me, and besides I like a little more debauchery when it comes to cookies (Hellooo Girl Guides Mint Chocolate!)  

What I did really enjoy however is the Red Velvet cupcakes and the Cinnamon buns. I can clearly state that Cinnabon is Satan anthropomorphized in the form of an unassumingly \"innocent\" cinnamon bun. One bite and you are subject to an assault of gushing grease and glucose that is likely to rocket your glycemic index right outta the stratosphere.  Upon eating the Bunner's cinnamon roll by comparison, I discover it is delightfully crumbly in texture and holds no punches in the cinnamon flavour department, with just the right amount of sweet that left me more sated than sickly.  The red velvet cupcake was a bit dry and lacking in chocolatey flavour but had a nice nutty, almost sesame like aroma and plenty of that delectable dairy free icing!

I have to agree with Erin B's review that having done some of my own Vegan/gluten free baking at home I can play around with more flavours and textures. Being the slacker baker I am I will gladly indulge in Bunner's healthy baked goods any day!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a quiet Saturday afternoon and grabbed 2 cupcakes to try - red velvet and vanilla strawberry.  Cupcakes were priced fairly expensive (around $7.00 for 2).  They were okay - a little dry and dense.

We are not vegan or allergic to gluten so our options for desserts are greater and we would probably not come back.  But this is a good choice for those that are vegan."}
{"text":"A heat wave was hitting Toronto when we were visiting in July.  Bunner's was sort of on our way to the Science Center, so we decided to pick up some dessert.  There is no seating available in the store, which was okay by me, as there was no air conditioning in the store.  We tried the red velvet, strawberry cream (summer special, I think), and chocolate.  Those were the best cupcakes I have ever had!  The cake itself was very moist.  I'm usually not a fan of a lot of frosting, so I removed about 50% of it, and the rest went very well with the cake.  

It's a good thing I don't live in Toronto.  I'd be eating cupcakes every day and getting super fat!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite vegan dessert place in Toronto. I have come here for all my sweets cravings as well as my past 3 birthdays for treats. I absolutely love their red velvet cupcakes while my boyfriend really enjoys their berry crumble bars. 

As many reviewers have mentioned, just because their treats are gluten-free and vegan, does not mean that they are healthy. They are definitely more on the sweet side and should probably not be consumed very often, as they are very sugary. Usually one visit to Bunner's satisfies my sugar craving for the next few months!"}
{"text":"YUM! Congratulations to Bunner's- this place is just amazing. Cute bakery with passionate and enthusiastic bakers. 

So far, I've tried butter tart, supersonic cookie, and coconut macaroon. All of these have completely blown me away! Being somewhat of a baker, I understand how substitutions for non-vegan ingredients and flour can be difficult to get perfectly, but Bunner's has mastered this new art. 

Will be stopping here at least once a week to try absolutely EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Had some cupcakes from here and they were overly sweet. The other bread products are not bad but the sweets have far too much sugar.  Even my kids would not finish the cupcakes. 

I also find the staff rather rude. I asked about the ingredients and all they would tell me is that they were vegan and didn't want to give away their secret recipe. One would think they of all people would be a little more sensitive to food sensitivities."}
{"text":"Wonderful little bakery in Toronto! 

100% vegan. 

Had an amazing cinnamon roll and creamie (two cookies with cream in the middle)

The prices were very reasonable and parking is not bad if you go around the corner."}
{"text":"Their bread is amazing.  The texture & taste is divine.  I admire the fact that Bunner's is vegan as well!  Part of me wants to know their secrets but the other part is just content to munch away on their delicious goodies.  It isn't so friendly for a small budget but if you have specialty needs for your nutrition - it is totally worth it for the occasional treat."}
{"text":"I live in mid town but make the hike to Bunner's regularly because it's by far the best gluten free/vegan bakery in town! I have never been disappointed by their service or baked goods. 

I recommend them to everyone I meet. Even my non vegan/gf friends enjoy their goods and go back on a regular basis. 

They also have amazing pizza/curry pockets which are a good option for a quick lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"A Vegan, Gluten-free bakery that has everything you could ever dream of. While on a walk through The Junction we discovered this little gem. Tucked into a little shop with a window that looks out onto the street the place is tiny and narrow but filled with yummy goodness. Of course, had to try the butter tarts (haven't had one for over 10 years) and they were thick, gooey and delicious. Just wish we had one closer to home. Yum!"}
{"text":"The only memory I had of vegan baked goods, was a chocolate cake I got for a work birthday one year, that was really mushy, and probably weighed about 20 lbs, and every bite I took there was a different flavour (one minute maple syrup, another coconut, another one banana....)  It was disconcerting, and a lot of it was wasted because everyone else was similarly grossed out!    

Now, enter Bunner's.  HOLY SCHNAUZERS, THAT BROWNIE?!?!?!?!  These baked goods are deceptively delicious, and I still can't believe that they are vegan and gluten free.  

Prices tend to be slightly steep here but well worth it!  And - one more thing is that delivery times tend to be inconvenient and if you want something it is safest to pre-order."}
{"text":"I must have had the same cashier as Lauren had when I went in today.  Unfortunately today was not the only day that I have experienced impatient and impolite staff at Bunners and so it must have been the same cashier the time before that too.  It's a shame because they do make wonderful vegan and gluten free items that everyone enjoys.  We shop here for school group purposes, for my office and for home.  I know how much effort they put into running this business and as a business woman myself I know how hard it is to run a business.  But like Lauren said you feel like a chump when the cashier is not friendly and you pay a good price for the products and support the store.  It could be because they are busy with phone orders and special orders that it's harder to help the person who comes in off the street or it could just be their culture.  In any event don't let it stop you from shopping there."}
{"text":"I did the same thing, I googled gluten free bread and found Bunner's.  
I've driven by countless times and finally ordered 2 loafs of bread, 3 muffins, 3 cookies & 3 stacked cookies for a trip I'm taking.
The service was great and they even delivered to me last minute.
The bread is YUM! and the cookies are soft.  
I'm impressed.   I had a sandwich & didn't have to toast!!! So good."}
{"text":"The most delicious bakery!! You will be shocked that it's gluten free and/or vegan. I wish my hometown had a bakery as amazing as this place!!!"}
