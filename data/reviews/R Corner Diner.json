{"text":"Came for the Thursday steak special ($10.99+ beverage purchase for the deal). Meal was substantial - steak with a greek or ceasar salad and fries. Opted for the greek salad, which was refreshing with a generous amount of dressing. Instead of fries, asked for mashed potatoes and the server obliged. The mash potatoes were a bit on the dry side, not as creamy as I would have liked. I ordered a medium cooked steak but it was served well done. Ended up eating it with steak sauce since I didn't want to send it back nor waste it. The cut of meat was okay given the price. Definitely a value play if you're looking for a homestyle cooked meal. Quaint restaurant with enough seating although it does get busy.  Prompt server given the steady traffic in the restaurant. Have tried a couple of other meal options such as the souvlaki in the past and found it better than the steak. Will likely come again to try the other specials. Might have been an off night."}
{"text":"Standard run of the mill diner serving up standard cheap breakfast. Ordered the 3 eggs with bacon, home fries and toast. Eggs were small, but good.  Poked perfectly. Home fries were likely McCain taters, which is a shame, seeing how easy home fires are to make. 
Toast was standard Wonderbread slices. No artisan bread here. 
Bacon can be made to order which was nice. 

Service was great and the place was packed. 

The place was packed at 10am on a Sunday. Mostly seniors enjoying breakfast. Would come again if I happen to be in the area again. 

$7.99 +$2 for unlimited coffee."}
{"text":"2 star for the server. .5 for the food - value and taste. Found out about this place through the entertainment book. Veal was too dry and pasta was drenched in oil. Portion sizes were tiny for the price and no garlic bread or salad served with the pasta as is usually customary at any other place you'd order a main pasta dish at. 
Had my feathers ruffled at the fact that they didn't honour deets on the coupon - said nothing about mandatory dine-in or that two beverages HAD to be purchased for the coupon to be valid. I wasn't in the mood to argue about it so obliged but when businesses don't honour their own marketing to check out the place, doesn't leave a good impression. 

Located on a side street in an auto/industrial area in a corner of a plaza, might be my reasoning in determining the desperate need for business by cutting corners and overcharging. We were the only people in there for lunch, business apparently slow."}
