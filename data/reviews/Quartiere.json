{"text":"Meh... Disappointed had high hopes. Service was friendly but very slow. The food was OK at best. Very pricey for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on a Thursday night. This place has a great atmosphere and the staff are extremely friendly. They have a nice small front yard with trees and plants that are perfect for small group to hang out. The restaurant is very clean and cute. As for the food, I had seafood linguine and caprese  as appetizer. They don't use excessive amount of heavy tasting sauce on their pasta like a lot of other Italian restaurant, and I absolutely love that. It feels more authentic and you can actually taste the fresh ingredient rather than a mouth full of sauce. The bread was the best I've ever had in any other Italian restaurants in the valley. Overall is a great dinning experience and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First the times we came here, the food was fresh and the pasta did taste homemade. I thought the refreshed look of the restaurant was nice. Came back for a third time the other night and ugh, not good. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo ($14.99) like the previous two times, and this time it tasted like Prego and boxed spaghetti.   My husband ordered the short rib plate for $17.99. It was dry and tasted like pot roast, the carrots were still raw. They've also added some paintings, one looks like it has arteries and veins, tasty looking while you're eating... Also, not sure why they gave it a name that is near impossible to pronounce. Two stars for the bread and service. Highly disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for a drink and take-out. Horrific all the way around. Luke warm draft beer....check Frozen Calamari w/ mostly breading...check To go portion of Chicken Alfredo could fit easily into a red solo cup..check. Chicken in the dish wasn't cooked all way through, so that went to my dogs. The old Riazzi's may have resembled a funeral parlor from the 1970's; but that place had character, something this new sterile/homogenized place has nothing of whatsoever. No TV w/ sports on anymore, but they are sporting a creepy painting of some woman behind the beer taps staring out over the restaurant. This place will be gone soon and good riddance."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews for the soft opening which is kind of unfair for a new place working out all the kinks. I came here for dinner and had a great time. The servers, Morgan and Brianna, were wonderful and attentive, and offered some great recommendations. I really liked the gorgonzola vinaigrette dressing, and the chicken Parmesan sandwich was delicious. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We checked in on a Friday evening and were really happy with our experience. Judging by the early reviews, they definitely corrected whatever growing pains they had when they first opened.  Sam, our server was friendly and attentive to our table. We loved the complementary bread they served after we were seated. Warm, soft, yummy. Part of me wants to go back just for that bread, is that bad?   For drinks I ordered their Arthur Ave. it was great, a little strong, just the way I like it. I had 2, my buddy had 3, we had a DD, so don't judge ha ha.  For the main course I ordered their Short Ribs over polenta and heirloom carrots. This was sooo good! Tender, flavorful, and just enough to leave me wanting more. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst service I've seen in years. I brought my wife here for a Valentine's Day dinner (our first time at this restaurant) and boy was that a bad idea. Our waitress was incredibly bad. We asked some basic questions about the menu items and she was dumbfounded... then disappeared into the back of the restaurant to \"go find out.\" Meanwhile, we had no bread, no drinks, no salt or pepper shakers, nor did anyone light the candle on our table (unlike all the other nearby tables that had lit candles).   After being seated for over 20 minutes, we were finally asked if we'd like to order drinks. We do and she disappears again, coming back some 10 minutes later (with NO drinks) and asks us if we're ready to order food or not. I ask her \"... and where are the drinks we ordered?\" She then looks sheepish and disappears again.   Some other server offered us garlic bread in the meantime (we were just about starving at this point) and we devoured it immediately. Then when our server comes back (with drinks this time... finally), we order our food and also ask to have one more garlic bread and to please bring salt and pepper shakers to our table, and to light our candle. She lights the candle and disappears again.   Fast forward to almost an hour at the table... no additional garlic breads, no salt or pepper shakers, no drink refills, nothing.... we're getting super unhappy at this point. We even asked another server passing by to please help us, and we were finally able to get another garlic bread, but nothing else. Two different people had said \"let me get you the shakers\" and NEVER delivered. Ughh.  Finally, some time later, we get our food... eggplant parmesan and salad, margarita pizza and meatballs. The salad and meatballs were good... but that eggplant parmesan and margarita pizza were not good at all.. it was incredibly disappointing. The eggplant parmesan had a weird bitter taste, and the pizza was undercooked and chewy, with no real flavor. Just bleh!   We could not be more disappointed with this place. Ruined V-Day dinner for us. Shame."}
{"text":"It looks great inside, the service was great and the food was delicious. The bread was nice and warm and just doughy enough- I probably could have been content just filling up on those. However I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. The chicken mixed with ham, marscapone and tomatoes was a really good flavor combo. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We took our daughter here for her birthday and it was a great experience. The Arthur Ave. cocktail is a great variation on the typical manhattan. The short rib ravioli with Parmesan cream sauce was to die for! Ambience was really nice. They took a lot of care in making sure the lighting is perfect and the decor was tasteful and current. If I lived in this neighborhood, I would make it my weekly place :-)"}
{"text":"New restaurant with a very inexperienced staff and bad food. Our waitress, when asked for a recommendation on the food, made sure to state she was vegan, and therefore did not know if the fish or chicken dishes were any good. Failed to even ask for a beverage order, I had to sneak that one in with my food order. A friend ordered the pizza, and barely ate half of the personal-size because of the bad taste. I ordered the chicken diavola, I guess vegans don't believe in salt either. The most bland, awful dish I've ever had in a restaurant. Another friend ordered the fish in a bag. He said the fish was decent, but would have preferred to eat the bag itself over the other ingredients inside it."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday around 6pm. The server was nice enough but obviously new to working in restaurants...I get it..we're all new at some point. He walked up after a few minutes and asked \"are you ready to order?\" No...let's get a bev order in and a second to look at menu. We ordered a couple of beers and an ice tea that came out half full in a plastic 7UP cup with no ice. Ok...I'll let that go..I'm being petty.  Ordered a caesar salad which was a house salad with a side of caesar dressing. Seafood Linguini was served with spaghetti noodles.  Shrimp Scampi was precooked contessa shrimp on spaghetti noodles (menu said bed of linguini) no scampi here. No pasta spoons. No salt pepper or grated cheese. I was ready to go.  The patio could be something nice but the guests are greeted by a big dirty fountain that hasn't been maintained.  I was hoping for a fun new place with basic Italian dishes but Quartiere really missed the mark. These are pretty big mistakes.... Italian 101. Hopefully the recipes/service standards are rethought and they can turn this new restaurant around."}
{"text":"I had been to both Spoke and Boulder, so I have a reasonable expectation about the food. Unfortunately, our food was disappointing. We ordered antipasto and bruschetta. The antipasto was like random sausages and cheeses put together, with a few slices of apples, some grapes that already started to rot, and Costco olives, on a bottom slice of a thick-crust baguette. My husband is Italian and usually can tell which region the sausages are from, but he couldn't. The rinds of prosciutto were not removed as should be before being sliced and served. Cheese and sausage pairing was missing from our plate. I couldn't taste whatever on my bruschettas. Too much jam and mascarpone but not enough everything else. Cherry bits sprinkled on the toast covered by thick mascarpone were almost non-existent. Tomato jam tasted like any sugary jam. I could see the basil (about one-half leave on two slices) but couldn't taste it. The vibes were good. It was welcoming and clean. Not sure about the choice of wall arts but I could ignore that. I really want Quartiere to succeed but wonder if it is possible. Maybe start with a few things they can do very well and expand slowly from there?"}
{"text":"In for dinner Friday evening.  Great food, great service.  Perfect local Italian spot!"}
{"text":"Good local restaurant. Really nice food, especially the beef tenderloin, bolognese pasta, lemon sorbet, and cannoli. Good atmosphere and nicely priced wines. Friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"Nice decorations and very comfy for a family dinner or a date night. Good food and good service, a little slow but still good.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Being in the Tempe neighborhood, I was excited to try a new Italian joint that used to be Riazzis. I wish I could give this place a higher review but I was unimpressed for several reasons.  The Pros:  - The drinks were fantastic! They did a pretty good job of making some fun and tasty cocktails. - Our waitress was also the barista and she was extremely friendly and accommodating. - Tons of free ample parking - The new makeover is simple but has brighten up the place quite a bit  The Cons: - The food was not very good.  We ordered the Borrata, Creamy Tomato Basil Soup, Short Rib Raviolo and the Carbonara. For my soup, I had an upcharge of a dollar for what I thought would be creamy soup but in fact tasted and looked like a pile of Marinara sauce with some Basil adorned on top, no idea where the word \"creamy\" came from. The Borrata is Mozzarella covered in Risotto that is breaded and fried. The pieces of bread that came with it were okay but the ball of Mozzarella didn't have much taste when combined with the Risotto. Plus there were cold pockets in the Mozzarella which was strange when half of it was Warm. I finally took my park of the Borrata and combined it with my Marinara soup to make it better and warmer. Our meals came out and I was in shock at the Carbonara. I lived in Europe for a few months so I have had a few good Carbonara in my day. It was not creamy in the least bit and was an eggy oily mess. I took one bite and was grossed out. The short rib ravioli was better but the combination was just strange. It didn't blend well and the meat quality was on the cheaper side. - The price/value. I don't mind spending more money for better value but being upcharged for soup that was marinara was silly and for 15 dollars I received 4 raviolis for my short rib. If it was better quality, I would not have minded the price - It was extremely quiet and empty. I'm sure people are still trying this new place but it was uncomfortably quiet, so much I heard another waitress complaining about her low tip from another table. Most of the staff hung around in the lounge so you could hear everything they were saying since we were the only ones in there  All in all, I hope this restaurant makes a few changes because we love the location and you can tell they have put a lot of time and money to renovate."}
{"text":"I'm always excited when I see fresh pasta on the menu but unfortunately the food was really disappointing across the board.  We started with the antipasto board and you could tell that the prosciutto had been open for awhile.  We also didn't care for the roasted grapes but this was a preference thing.  For mains we had the short rib ravioli (filling was dry) and the chicken and pesto (chicken was overdone, the pasta didn't really come out with any sauce and was thus really dull).  As these were both of their fresh pastas we really expected more.  All of the beer seems to be cans which wasn't clear on the menu.  The highlight were the people we interacted with.  The hostess was kind and our server (Chloe) was very attentive, hence the two stars."}
{"text":"The pizza at Quartiere is *incredible*! The texture of the crust is the perfect balance of chewy and toasty. We had an order of meatballs for an appetizer, and they were wonderful too. They were flavorful, but not overly seasoned.... which is rare to find. Can't wait to go back to try another pizza!"}
{"text":"Five-stars all the way! I enjoyed an amazing lunch: zucchini sticks, Caesar salad, and mozzarella pizza. All delicious!! I'm looking forward to coming back and trying additional dishes. The restaurant is beautiful and has a great dining space. Thank you Quartiere for excellent service and delicious food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time here was a pleasant and enjoyable one. I came here w my boyfriend and his family for his birthday dinner due to his friend's recommendation. We were not disappointed. They set a wooden platter of hot crusty bread from the oven. I assumed that was the free appetizer/house bread. We all enjoyed it, my boyfriend especially. The antipasto platter, which at first I was not feeling too keen on, but was what my bf's dad picked, was scrumptious. The presentation was unique as well. It was a brown paper bag, and inside it was wrapped a slice of crusty bread, with slices of cheese and various meats, olives, pepperoncinis, diced roasted red peppers and roasted grapes (cold). I'd never tried grapes cooked in that way before but I thought it was yummy. Everyone echoed my thoughts as we tucked in hungrily. The salads came next. My bf's mom had the house salad which she said she didn't really enjoy. The rest of us had Caesar salad: the veggies were crunchy and delicious with the dressing, with parmesan flakes and croutons. We also had the option of cracked black pepper on top, which we all opted for. My bf's sister had the minestrone soup which was decent enough. For the main dishes, we ordered chicken alfredo pasta, bolognese pasta and seafood linguine w mussels and clams. The bolognese was yummy and full of meaty flavor. I could tell all the pasta was handmade with love. The chicken alfredo was good too. However my dish, which was the seafood linguine, lacked sauce and flavor. It was kinda dry as well. I was quite disappointed with it honestly, and resolved not to order it again. For dessert, everyone had coffee and cannoli. We all loved the cannoli (I myself found it a tad too sweet; nonetheless, still one of the best I'd ever tried) and the dessert was a hit. All-in-all, we had a good night here. Our server, Brie, was a very sweet girl with such a sweet voice and was helpful and attentive. I can't wait to come back on a date w my boo and try all the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place for lunch today. They have both a lunch menu and their full menu available. Our server was fantastic. Helped us to make an informed decision in which entrees we'd like the best. They have a great selection of beer and wine too. I have the piccata and my business partner had the manicotti. Both were excellent. Great portions without being to big. I would strongly recommend this place to any Italian food lover."}
{"text":"If you want Italian food - don't come here!   Cold and impersonal - no TV in the bar which would match the cold concrete floor! What is the matter with this place?!!!!   If you want to stay in business you need to listen to your feedback!"}
{"text":"Tried not to be negatively biased because I loved Riazzi's so much. I really wanted to like this place. However, the beer is barely cold, the portions are small, and the food quality seems slightly below Olive Garden, yet the prices are higher than Riazzi's were. I'm baffled trying to figure out how they expect to stay in business. If you're going to do Italian food, than do it! The whole experience seemed very half assed and over-priced. Not bad. But not good."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a soft opening for what we thought was brunch at 10am this morning but was lunch. We had espresso and decided on a light appetizer before moving onto another dog friendly brunch patio.  The space looks clean and is a definite change from the local mainstay Riazzi's it replaced. The patio is lovely with mature trees and a little oasis on Mill Ave.   They are planning on more brunch options rolling out and we are definitely looking forward to see what this place becomes! The owners of Boulders on Broadway salvaged the restaurant space and managed to keep some staff and some of the regular patrons are keeping this place local!  Solid beginning, the bread was amazing, the mozzarella appetizer was really surprising since it had a ton of grain we weren't expecting so maybe the description needs to include that!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute and modern! I was I could give it 3.5 stars! If you're looking for authentic Italian cuisine, this isn't the place. However, the food is still very good! The staff, bartenders, chef, and even the other diners were incredibly nice and welcoming! It's definitely a nice little date night place! I would go back if I'm looking for something cute and fun!"}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner twice and had a great experience both times.  I didn't go to its former establishment, Riazzi's because I was put off by the eye sore patio. It looked unkempt from the outside which made me believe the inside wasn't much better.  I'm happy to report it's been cleaned up and looks inviting now that it's Quartiere; check out my patio pics.  The warm and welcoming feel of the patio with large family style tables carried right on through to the inside.  The restaurant area is spacious making it the perfect place to gather for family & friends dinners.  The bar is on the other side and offers a different dinning experience that's ideal for smaller parties or any singletons who don't mind dinning alone.  The restaurant has a clean and minimalistic decor with little details here and there that add life, like the awesome mural behind the bar and funny sign next to the men's room.  Ok that's just the vibe of the place, now the food.  I've had the seafood linguini and the selection of seafood was fresh and not over cooked which tends to happen with at least one of the shellfish on seafood plates. The pasta is made in house and it was absolutely delicious, I could eat it alone.  The other item I've tried is the short rib ravioli which is a family favorite!  Again, the pasta is on point and then you bite into these savory pockets of meat topped with a creamy sauce, yum!  The table bread and butter is reason alone to come here.    I saw a couple of reviews complaining about the service and my experiences have been A+.  Very friendly owners, I love that they are always present and greeting tables which shows how much they care.  I can't image any customer bringing a complaint to their attention that they didn't try to rectify immediately.  I wish I lived in the area because I crave this place on the regular.  Drop what you're doing and go there, you won't be sorry.  PS they carry that Chianti that comes in a basket. I dunno what it's called but it's the first table wine my folks let me have and I still love the stuff!"}
{"text":"Really good food and  great service ,the bread is amazing . Bar area is very artistic and welcoming. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came to Q for dinner last night and left happy. Service was friendly, attentive and timely. We had the Chianti for wine but we also sampled the two wines on draft that were surprisingly good and easy drinkers. The white was not too sweet and the red wasn't too fruity.   As others have stated, the garlic bread is really good; hot, ooey and gooey. The salads are pretty standard but the lemon vinaigrette had great flavor. My husband and I loved our meals. I had the pulled pork ravioli and was in heaven! Maybe get extra bread to sop up the extra sauce!"}
{"text":"This was our first meal at this restaurant but it won't be our last. The garlic bread is so good you can't stop at one loaf. I had the Chicken Alfredo and my husband had the meatball sub. We were both very happy with the quality of the food. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy and it is not overly loud so you can still have conversation with dinner   We use to go an Italian restaurant called Marcellos but they closed. We are happy we found Quartiere because it is our new favorite Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The wine on draft is surprisingly really good as is the twisty bread they bring you. We started with the mussels appetizer and OH WOW was it amazing! The portion was huge and flavor amazing. They steam them in a bag with bread on the bottom that soaks up all the wonderful garlic and juices. We'll come back just for that! I also had the bolognese which was right on the money. My friends had the chicken parmesan which was another whopping portion and looked delicious and the ravioli. And My cousin raved about the short rib entree. We will definitely be back and recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to giving this new place a try after Riazzi's closed their doors. I have to give this new place a solid 3. Looking at the menu,  there were many classic items and prices were to be expected,  $13+ for entrees. I noticed that they offer RC products for soda which was an Instant bummer.  At least,  they have Dr. Pepper. The bread was pretty good,  kind of like a sweet doughy pretzel taste. I ordered chicken parm, and have to admit i was disappointed. Although the meal was delivered hot, the flavor was just not there and was very bland,  and the pasta was overcooked. My fiancee ordered spaghetti and meatballs,  he also said it needed seasoning and just kind of bland to taste. Unfortunately, the server never came back to check on us other then to drop off our check. I can't say this place was good enough to make me want to give them another try."}
{"text":"The beef tenderloin was incredible and the service was great. I will be back! We had a large group and everyone loved their meal."}
{"text":"Delicious! The bread is fresh baked and comes out still warm. The short rib ravioli was our favorite dish. The sauce is thick and creamy and the meat is moist. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken carbonera - yuuuuuuuuum! Lemon vinaigrette dressing on the salad was light and zesty. Great customer service! They've done a phenomenal job renovating the place. Light fixtures and bar area were my favorite details."}
{"text":"I sure didn't experience all the hate people are posting.  I ordered lunch to go for my office.  I called it in and was told it would be about 25 minutes for 5 dishes.  More than a reasonable amount of time.  When I arrived I was greeted by a happy hostess and sent to the bar for pickup.  The order was ready for us upon arrival.  When we got back to the office there were no errors and the food was still warm.  We all got something a little different and were all pleasantly surprised about the thought and quality that went into their food.  It was definitely made with love!  I got the chicken parmesan pasta with a fresh bright marinera sauce.  The pasta was lovely.  Others ordered the chicken sandwich, chicken alfredo, chicken and pesto, and spaghetti with meatballs.  No complaints here!  The serving sizes were more than generous and each item came with a salad.  The salads were very fresh with no wilted greens at all!  We also received their house braided bread which was awesome!   Riazzi's was tired and run down.  I cannot imagine what the carpet looked like when they pulled it out of this place.  Quartiere has a bright and cheery feel.  I encourage everyone who has posted bad comments to give it another try.  Put your nostalgia aside and go with an open mind."}
{"text":"The best thing about my take out was the bread. I was really hoping for a great place, close to home. So disappointed I ordered the short rib ravioli...and what a waste of $16 that was! The pasta was so gross and overworked it was tough to eat and ended up throwing it away! And the filling inside? That was the most bland short rib ever. Sad...hopefully they can pull together and turn the place around."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and will not return. The customer service was outstanding (reason for the two star rating); however the food left a lot to be desired. Their shrimp scampi was gross...not seasoned, just noodles on lemon juice, topped by asparagus, garlic, tomato and frozen shrimp. Their soup tasted like canned soup. My husband's dish tasted like a frozen meal that was microwaved. Not a place that I could recommend. My husband had the eggplant parmesan and was equally displeased."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so bad because it's walking distance from my house and this area desperately needs and deserves an adult restaurant. I was hoping for an experience like Cibo in DT Phx but this wasn't that. My first clue was the cocktail. I took a chance and went with the bartender's recommendation. Big mistake. It tasted like something I would have concocted when I was 13. I went out to the patio and poured it out so I wouldn't hurt the bartender's feelings. The food was not much better. Nothing tasted homemade. The service was spotty. It was pricey especially considering we barely touched our food. Please please please get better we really want and need  a great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Good solid Italian food. Probably the best authentic Italian food in Tempe! Awesome, all the way around and Italian beer on tap! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a shame that I'm writing this low of a review for a place that was put on the \"Hot and New\" list. Considering it was new, I'm wondering if the chef was still very new at his new job. I had such high hopes for this place with the decor outside and inside, and it didn't help that their bread was really the only thing that was great. I ordered the chicken Alfredo, that needed to be confirmed a few times. My girlfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. After a reasonable amount of time, our scatterbrained server sat a steaming plate of disappointment in front of us. On my plate, I was surprised to see no chicken in a pool of fluid they mentioned was \"Alfredo\", and my girlfriend had balls of what could have been my dogs wet food in what almost looked like better than canned marinara. I tried to explain to our server our disappointment and it probably could have been in Chinese considering she couldn't comprehend anything I was saying. The final blow was that we paid $33 for the worst food in Arizona. Take my advice and don't come to this true rotting hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing loved the Grilled brussels sprouts and the anti-pasta board was amazing Owen don't forget about the bread they serve you before the dinner yummy"}
{"text":"I want to start off that the girl helping me was super sweet and helpful.   I got to go, just the spaghetti dish. I know they are new, so I completely understand the menu changing often. She placed the order as a kids spaghetti because she didn't realize there was an actual entree. This was because she thought I was ordering the one with meatballs, without meatballs. I understand that she was trying to save my a few bucks with the cheaper one, but I had to ask for some more of the pasta. The portion was maybe 5 bites, disappointing.   The spaghetti was undercooked and the pasta sauce definitely tasted jarred, which is a super big turnoff for an Italian restaurant. (Honestly, the main reason for the 2 stars) I might try this place again, as I understand opening a restaurant has a lot of kinks and things to constantly change. We will see next time. But I will say I do sincerely appreciate the girl helping me as she was patient and understanding. I hope to have her as my server if I come back!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for so long for a place like this in Tempe. Awesome atmosphere...great outdoor patio ...incredible cocktails, not to mention the twisty bread thing that you get as soon as you sit down! That is just straight heaven!! Brussel sprouts are so tasty and the staff are attentive and great! Bravo for a new gem in our neck of the woods"}
{"text":"Time of Visit: Dinner (near 7PM)   Wait Time: 40+ min (although we had a \"reservation\")  Food: The food was somehow undercooked and overcooked all around. I ordered the beef tenderloin and it was sitting in a bath of what looked like dirty sink water (the sauce should have been reduced more to achieve the desired taste and aesthetic). The vegetables on my dish were all undercooked and my tenderloin was overcooked (almost dry).   Environment: The atmosphere they were trying to achieve did not come across at all. When we attended, the walls, booths, and lighting all seemed unfinished. The booth we were sat in was too small and was under an incredibly bright cafeteria-like ceiling light. Near our booth was a hole in the wall that clearly should have been filled with a light. The walls near our booth looked like they were covered in a greasy residue that had not been cleaned.   Price: The bread was absolutely delicious, but we were charged an extra $2 for another piece. Given the food was mediocre at best, the decently high price point is not worth returning."}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday Brunch and I got the Italian eggs!! They were delicious and the presentation was beautiful! We also split the monkey bread and it was warm, gooey and just the right amount of sweetness! The atmosphere is open and warm and the little courtyard is so quaint!   Our waitress was awesome and so attentive and we got $5 off coupons for it being our first time there as well as a punch card for buy 5 lunches get one free!    I will definitely be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Beautiful remodel, wonderful atmosphere.  Very reasonably priced.  They just opened, so complaints about food or service are a little harsh in other reviews.  Our experiences so far have been very good, leaving very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Took my family last Friday to the former Riazzis now known as Quartiere.  I'd been anxious to try the new restaurant especially since I know a few people involved in it's renovation.  We were greeted by a hostess that seemed almost bothered by having to seat us and came across as somewhat coarse.  Once seated, it was around 10 minutes before the servers coordinated and finally assigned someone to our table.  I realize that since this is a new restaurant and maybe some of the staff are still finding their footing but making a customer wait so long before being acknowledged is almost a crime against humanity!  Once our server arrived, she took our drink order which consisted of a beer, glass of chardonnay and 2 ice teas for our kids.  We were brought out a small loaf of under baked bread which we ate anyway and ordered the fried zucchini which came with a small side of marinara which did not last very long.  Both were flavorful however.  My son and I shared the Calabrese pizza ($16 for ~12\" pie) which almost had too many kalamata olives on it which made for a very salty pizza.  Wife had the seafood linguini pasta ($16)  which came with a few clams and a small portion of linguini. She said she preferred the linguini with clam sauce at the old Nellos in Tempe which is now closed.  My other son ordered the kids anti pasta plate which he liked.  The shift manager, Ted did stop by to chat putting a friendly personality on our experience.  All in all they are trying to make this a place many of the former Riazzi patrons could come back to and find a bit of Riazzis nostalgia while introducing new clientele to a new ambiance and menu. I think they have a ways to go and with a final bill of almost $81 (including a $10 tip) for a family of 4 with 2 small kids, it's not for the budget minded."}
{"text":"This was the old Riazzis on Mill Avenue and I must say, I miss it so much.  New ownership has taken over this restaurant and totally remodeled it and the old school Italian restaurant feel is gone.  Stepping into Riazzis was like stepping back in time and it just felt right.  They should have never remodeled it.  It just doesn't have the same feel.  As far as the food goes, it's good, but not great.  My wife's short rib raviolis were way under cooked and pretty tough.  Riazzis had a home made ravioli that was the best I've ever tasted and I wish so much this company had kept that recipe.  The bolognese was tasty, but the amount of sauce you get is pretty small.   It's mostly bare spiral pasta.   The fresh bread they brought out was amazing so thumbs up on that.  The service is quite slow compared to the quick and friendly service Riazzis had.  Overall, it's not horrible, but it certainly will never replace Riazzis in my heart.   I'm sad to see that family get out of the business."}
{"text":"Came to this new place cause it is near our home and we used to stop in to Riazzi's on occasion because their food was truly Italian and we figured this new place would follow their lead. Well,  WRONG! Nothing we ordered, from the way over cooked Pasta,  to the obviously frozen Chicken and Eggplant was any good. In fact, it was down right bad. The sauce, which is the Backbone of any Italian restaurant, tasted like it came from a jar, or maybe their supplier. Also, the Beer was not nearly cold enough. Really disappointed, we would have liked a good local Italian place near us.  Not this one."}
{"text":"My first experience since the establishment changed ownership, this is from a couple of months ago. I have not been back. I wish I could say the food was incredible and I do hope that the kitchen continues to improve because there is great potential!  It wasn't a completely horrible time! The renovated ambiance is simple yet inviting. The space is much more open and cheery. My server was friendly and helpful. The table bread is fantastic (pics attached) and is clearly made in house. I ordered the mussels and pesto chicken and decided to add a salad for $1. I found it odd that plastic ramekins were used for the salad dressing, definitely not eco-friendly and gives the impression of being too cheap. The mussels were okay, nothing out of this world but decent. They seemed over cooked or previously frozen (or both), however, the sauce was tasty and the pesto calabrese bread that came with it was awesome, especially soaked in the broth. I DO have to mention the presentation of the mussels was a a charming idea but a little bit sloppy. A waxy paper folded into a boat shape and held together with clothespins.  I had to take GREAT care because any slight movement had the tasty juice flowing out. I held it together for the most part ;)   The pesto dish was underwhelming, had no flavor, was over salted, and the chicken was dry. I pushed it to the side and waited for the server to come back around. I had a book and was enjoying a cup of coffee, so waiting wasn't a big deal. She came around eventually, asked if I needed a box, aaaaand I did something I NEVER do, I sent my food back. She offered to speak to the chef and took the dish to the kitchen. A few minutes go by...the chef comes out himself to ask me what was wrong. ... It was hard for me to even say I didn't like the dish so having to speak to the person in charge of the food was incredibly overwhelming for me!! He was polite enough but the whole interaction felt too confrontational for my liking and a little bit pushy. I honestly didn't even want it remade, but I felt like I had to. He personally made the second pesto dish. It DID improve, but only slightly. I ended up packing it to go and not eating it later. :/ the manager put a small discount on my bill, which was pleasant. I left feeling underwhelmed.   Hate to be a broken record, but I miss Riazzi's!!! So close I could walk to authentic Italian cuisine. I'll give it a few more months before I check out Quartiere again. Fingers crossed! The neighborhood is rooting for you!"}
{"text":"First stop at the new place. They own a few restaurants so this isn't their first rodeo. Our waitress Chloe was great, as was Ted, the manager who stopped by. Simple menu, with about a dozen options in each category. Salad was fresh, dressing tasty. Bread served with meal was freshly baked, tasty. More bread available at $2 a serving. I had Chicken Diavlo and my friend had the Spaghetti and meatballs. Sauce was a bit heavy, amount and taste of chicken was good. Portion medium to small. I wouldn't order it again, but that's just me. Finished off with some lemon sorbet (very tasty), and my friend had a cannoli, which he enjoyed.   Glad they gutted the East coast feel from the early 70's, and really brighten up the place inside and out. Expanded patio will be popular. I'm looking forward to trying other items. They do have a happy hour with discounts on drinks, not the food."}
{"text":"Happy I finally stopped by to try this! It's a great location with plenty of parking.  Overall - nice modern interior that still feels homey, menu fits the name at they are going for 'Italian food for the people'. There's nothing pretentious about this place and the food fits the environment - modern while being homey. I could see this being a great place to host an event or even a wedding reception.  Server was great, dishes where timed appropriately, portions were good and not overwhelming. Everything we tried (table bread, burrata, cesar salad, manicotti, bolognese and tiramisu to-go) is worth ordering again, although I think I will try a few of the other dishes I had my eye on next visit ;) Only constructive criticism was that it took a while to be seated. Although there was sign saying wait to be seated, there was no one to be found to seat us for close to 4 minutes. Could be that we were there around 5 so it was super early for dinner, but worth mentioning that I am glad we waited!"}
{"text":"We truly had high hopes for this start-up from the people who bring us Boulders on Broadway and Spokes on Southern. The entry way and outdoor patio is lovely - very sparkly and intimate. Interior of the restaurant is a bit plain, though the wood walls are a nice touch. We were seated promptly with a reservation and our waiter, Alfredo, took our order pretty quick-like, and the owner came around for a visit. I do love that in a new place. Cocktails - on the mark, so fabulous. Really well done! First course - the bread plate was warm'ish and the braid is very decorative. But, the bread tasted like something between a pretzel and what I might pick up in the frozen section at the grocery store. It could be better - olive oil? Parmesan? Salads all around and completely lackluster. A few pieces of lettuce, a smattering of shredded carrot, two slices of cucumber and two cherry tomatoes. Boring. Boring. Boring. Lemon vinaigrette was average at best. For the mains - very small portions on the pasta. If you're a big eater, you will be disappointed. The pasta was cooked nicely, the bolognese was spicy, and the piccata was a very small piece of so-so chicken. Fish in a bag was nicely turned out, but the potatoes and asparagus below were mushy. Way Way Way too much pepper on the fish. I would try this place again... maybe... they may need a little time to up their game. I'll go three stars for the fish, the bread, the service, and the cocktails. Everything else needs some work."}
{"text":"Yummy! The food was very good and the service was excellent.  Very happy we found this hidden gem in Tempe.  Traditional Italian in a very cool setting."}
