{"text":"Typically the server here is a whore that will be overly friendly and flirt with your husband while your trying to eat. Then see your husband at veganfest, like my husband gus. And flirt with him and hit on him in front of you. GUS isnt interested in you, more than that we both think it's disgusting that you conduct yourself in this manner with married men. Get some self respect. And no we will not be returning or buying anything more from foug's kitchen, sorry doug, hire a waitress with class."}
{"text":"A great spot to get brunch/lunch if you're around Glencairn station. There are a few classics on the menu that don't change, like the Egg McNish, but often there's a decent amount of variety. Gone are the days when you could walk in and just take a seat - highly suggest making reservations if you're going during the weekend; a weekday visit doesn't really require reservations."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. I had the burger of the day with a Caesar salad and both were so flavorful and filling. My sister ordered tostadas and said the same thing. Who would think healthiest food could taste that good?! The price you pay for it is absolutely justified. The staff is friendly and helpful. Would give 5 stars if the decor was more sophisticated."}
{"text":"The best in vegan cooking.  Not a vegan but loved it.  Wonderful good cooked to perfection with enough flavour for foodies out there. Tried the fig pancake special.  Amazing brunah options."}
{"text":"We've been here at least a dozen times so I've tried almost everything on the menu (which changes often). The food is incredible! I should point out that I'm not vegetarian and that makes me appreciate this place even more because I know how hard it is to make vegetarian meals flavorful. You'll soon forget you're eating vegetarian and enjoy the rich, balanced flavor creations that will blow your mind. If you are vegetarian than missing this place is a crime because I don't think anyone can do vegan gourmet as well as Doug. If you're not, give this place a try to experience what's  possible without meat/dairy. My favorites are the French toast and tempeh \"bacon\" and vegan lasagna."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! The very best burger known in our solar system!!! This is a place to know!!!  Great service at the front of the house. Thank you and I'll be back every time I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"Choose here after Lauren Toyota mentioned Doug's cashew cream cheese on her vlog. I came here for my birthday and enjoyed the scramble platter,it was very filling but I wasn't a fan of the tempeh bacon (to smokey sweet like a teriyaki flavor). I would come here again,very kid friendly. The reason for the low score is the restaurant size and location. There needs to be more restaurants like this in reachable areas,this is the time for change...people are ready!"}
{"text":"Although Doug McNishs's Public Kitchen is in an out-of-the-way location, it is well worth the trek here for a memorable vegan treat. We came for brunch - between the four of us, we had two Reubens, a Vegan Benedict, and the Coconut-Crusted French Toast. Everyone in our party loved the food. Excellent flavours, good portions sizes, high-quality ingredients, and filling without being over-the-top. Probably the best Benedict I've had; the vegan yolk is actually \"oozy\" (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in Toronto, as good as NYC! SO GOOD! Been for pop up dinners, brunch, and am a regular at Brickworks and I love it all. Definitely not many seats so reservations at the kitchen are a must. Also love the chef's dedication to ingredients. He's always available to answer questions on recipes and sourcing. With all of the trendy plant based places in TO using GMO tofu, conventional canola, and god knows what else, I'm glad there is someone trying to make a difference!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fantastic, healthy, great tasting food you found it.  Currently the restaurant has smoothies, juices and one sit down entree a day.  However, there are lots of salads and take home entrees in the cooler that you can choose from.  The day I went, the lunch entree  of the day was an out of this world tostada.  It was very filling and refreshing at the same tim.  Layered with lettuce, guac, cashew sour cream and tomatoes and much more.  Living in NYC I have had tons of raw/live cuisine and this was one of the best.  In addition to the tostada I also got the peanut butter fudge and chia dip.  Both are great items.  This is a great place to stock up on healthy quick meals if you are a busy individual.  It is my understanding that Duug is also working on a new menu that will be out in the next week or so.  Can't wait to be back in Toronto to try it.  In the meantime, run don't walk to Doug's Public Kitchen for some yummy food."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautifully crafted with just the right balance between components. In particular, the candied orange rind on the french toast was fantastic. Portions were good. Wonderful chef. Would love to see a downtown location."}
{"text":"A party of 4 of us visited Public Kitchen on April 5th. 

We had a delightful meal where we purposely did our best to try a range of dishes from the menu among the 4 of us. The scrambles and club sandwich were awesome.
Very tasty, and very satisfying. The tortilla wraps were tasty and each plate felt well balanced with a variety of ingredients. 

The savory popcorn appetizer offered free when we arrived was nice to nibble on as we considered our meal options.

No question this is one of the best vegan options in the GTA!
It is truly an artisan food experience.. 

Also a key part of our experience, the service was very friendly and upbeat. 
It was a wonderful atmosphere on an unseasonably cold April day. We lingered over the end of our meal in conversation - and there was never any push to clear our bill despite it being quite busy.

My only wish is that they were closer to our home in the east end. 
No matter, it will be well worth the rip in the future!

The VegHeads team."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot my wife suggested we try. While it was hard to distinguish on the street, once we found it, and the free parking lot behind it, it is an amazing brunch spot.  Food came out quickly, I'm a big vegetarian, and as far as vegan spots go this place surpassed my expectations. Definitely pricey, but I don't mind paying for quality"}
{"text":"Certainly the best Veggie-Burger in Toronto, as well as the top vegan weekend brunch. Outstanding vegan mac & cheese, as well as a host of other take-out options. Prepare to be amazed..."}
{"text":"Both the brunch and dinner offerings are excellent. Doug and a uniquely brilliant way of adding creative flavour and technique to his thoughtfully crafted dishes. From \"eggs\" Benedict to Tempeh burgers...not to mention the friendly staff...can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"An excellent establishment! The food and staff are impeccable. I had the triple decker sandwich, and at times forgot that I wasn't eating a traditional, bacon filled BLT. Each bite was as flavourful as the one that proceeded it. You can tell the cooks put their hearts into each dish. Their coffee was great as well! I'll definitely be returning soon to try new dishes!"}
{"text":"Even though I'm writing against the current here, I didn't love the vegan brunch here as much as others.

I had the eggs benedict which is made of english muffin, tofu, tomato and an \"egg\". I would say the predominant taste is sour, which is fair - the egg is made of yeast, but I would prefer my food to be either savoury or sweet rather than sour. The quality of the food is great and the server was nice. 

My friend had their apple pancakes which were okay but a bit burnt. Maybe we just went on an off day and should've ordered something else or maybe we're just not vegan loving food eaters but I would say to seek brunch elsewhere if you are looking for a more indulgent brunch option. 

I did like that they had some take out and take home options like prepared foods and srirachas."}
{"text":"We tried a number of dishes at dinner service and while we enjoyed everything we ate, the king oyster mushroom \"scallops\",  the mushroom \"calamari\", the \"sushi\" roll and the mixed dessert platter were standouts! The runny \"egg\" was a lot of fun! Very realistic in texture and appearance. 

If you want dishes that will excite and satisfy your palate, then try the dishes that I've recommended when you go to Public Kitchen."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday and had wonderful time the food was delicious and service was great. I can't wait to go there again. Tostada was delicious"}
{"text":"Great choice for Sunday brunch. For vegans and meaties alike. Flavours were nice, portion sizes large. Very friendly service. Loved the tempeh bacon, friend had the platter which was huge. Will return for sure. Liked the pre-made take home options, bought quite a few. My only disappointment was the dirty downstairs area and washroom."}
{"text":"Doug is a master raw vegan chef serving up an array of scrumptious organic food.

I'm a particular fan of the Scramble tofu offered at his ever popular Sunday brunch. Comes with mashed sweet potato and gluten free toast. Savoury and filling. The price is fair because everything is organic and even if you're eating something sweet like the raw crepes, you're eating all whole food ingredients. What does that mean? Every ingredient is a fruit, vegetable or spice.

In addition to the lunch/dinner and brunch menu, Doug has a great take away fridge showcasing a delicious selection of raw treats, hearty soups and salads, his insanely delicious mac n \"cheese\", lasagna and more. 
So my only advice is, if you plan to dine in, bring extra money for the extra goodies to go."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I'm a huge carnivore and I think I could eat here 8 days a week, no exaggeration."}
{"text":"I've not visited the restaurant yet, but I had the pleasure of having Doug's take home Mac and Cheese, and as an omni, I was frankly prepared to moderate my expectations when evaluating the dish, but it was staggeringly good, and I can honestly say one of the very best Mac and Cheese dishes I've ever had in my life, vegan or otherwise. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Hanging out with a vegan friend, but you're not vegan? This is the place to go. They have a wide assortment of dishes that taste delicious for the omnivores out there like myself.

We came here based on reviews, and we're glad we did. It's in a quite unusual spot. On Sunday, around brunch time, it felt like we were the only people in the area. Most of the other stores were closed. They have a small parking lot at the back. The restaurant itself is quite small, and they didn't take reservations. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table of two. 

When we were seated, they brought over some water with charcoal in it (interesting...). They also had some specials that day, including tacos! Yes, tacos! That's obviously what I ordered. When it came out of the kitchen, it looked and smelled delicious. Even though I was starving, I couldn't even finish two tacos, there were so delicious and filling. We ended up taking the leftovers to-go. They also had other food items, like pastas and salads that you could take out. 

Service is great. Popcorn appetizers were DELICIOUS. How can it tastes so buttery but without the butter?! Mmmm."}
{"text":"I was there on the coldest day in February but it was worth braving the outdoors.  The food is imaginative and delicious.  the atmosphere is very white and bright surroundings.  It looked like they use card tables.  But it's all about the food which was superlative.  I can't wait to come into town again for another meal."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this was in my neighbourhood but what a pleasant surprise!!! I ordered the Reuben to go and was overjoyed with its taste and texture.  I've never had a 'real' Reuben since I've been a vegetarian for almost 40 years so I can't compare.  What I can say though, it's that it was delicious!!  The bread was tasty and perfectly toasted.  The sauerkraut was neither vinegary nor creamy.  This sandwich was pure perfection!  You have earned my respect and a regular customer.  Thank you for being genuine."}
{"text":"Such a great brunch. A little on the fancier side of vegan fare, but in a very relaxed unpretentious atmosphere. Win! The menu ranges from light breakfast fare to a serious brunch with items like pancaked, tofu scramble, and even a vegan breakfast sandwich with a faux egg (runny yellow yolk and everything!). The popcorn as a complementary ap is brilliant, too. Take me back!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for brunch in the last month. We were able to squeak in without a reservation on a Saturday, but I made sure we had a reservation the second time because this place is very busy!

The Good:

- Wide selection of 100% vegan food. There's something for everyone, and they do an excellent job creating classic dishes with a vegan twist. They create their own \"eggs\" and \"bacon\", which both taste quite good. There might be some who don't realize it's a vegan restaurant, because they really do a great job.

- The blueberry pancakes and the coconut french toast are divine. The pancakes were on special, but they really should be a regular on the menu. The other food I've had (avocado toast with \"egg\", and huevos rancheros) was OK, but I wasn't blown away. 

- The goji berry latte and their regular house coffee are both lovely. 

- Service is efficient and friendly

- Cozy and bright restaurant, free parking out back.

The Bad:

- Eh, it's pricey... 

- Some of the dishes are really good and some are just OK (see my comment above)

Bottom Line: Whether you're vegan, eating clean, or someone who eats everything, come here for brunch. We spoke to the chef on our first visit, and told him we enjoyed everything and weren't even vegan. His response was something along the lines of, we're just trying to make good food. Get a sweet dish but don't expect too much from the savoury dishes (unless you follow one of the other posters' advice and get something that rocks)."}
{"text":"What a delicious brunch spot! On a quick Yelp search, I came up with Public Kitchen. An out of the way vegan eatery just west of Allen Rd. with an incredible selection of gluten-free and vegan options.

I went for the scramble platter and a black coffee. Scrambled tofu with caramelized onions, mushrooms and peppers, home fries, sautéed greens, tempeh bacon and black bean sweet potato chili and GF toast with miso butter on the side. Just incredible: fresh, healthy and plated with care. Their fair-trade coffee was good too. Prices accurately reflect the quality of food.

If you have time, check out their small cooler in the rear of the dining area. It's filled with house-made soups, salads, sauces and various energy bites you can purchase to go. They even make their own kombucha!

Comfortable atmosphere with friendly down-to-earth service and some of the best vegan food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Delicious, vegan, big breakfast.

First off this place is pretty busy so call first to reserve seats. Plenty of breakfast options and weekly specials. I ordered the Benedict. So delicious. Hollandaise is creamy. Egg yolk is legit and approved by meat eaters. Friendly service. Complimentary charcoal water and popcorn. Free parking at the back.

Overall this is the best vegan place for breakfast I have ever tried. Shout out to Doug Mcnish for great vegan food."}
{"text":"Well, I like this place, but there could be some improvements as well.  

Let's start off what I liked:
1. Totally vegan! What???
2. Nice brunch selection and even \"eggs\" benedict.  
3. Free vegan popcorn (i.e. without the butter) and it tasted awesome.  
4. There's a charcoal filter in the water so it cleanses while you drink
5. Service is fast and friendly.
6. I liked the Hollandaise sauce, the yolk and the bun as well on the \"eggs\" benedict. 
7. Clean
8. Oh and their vegan Sricha sauce! So friggin good.

What needs improvement:
1.  The tofu (which I assume is supposed to be the meat) was a bit lacking in creativity IMO.  It was just a big block of tofu stuffed in there.  While it definitely created the illusion of eggs, it felt a bit awkward. 

Yeah that's the only thing I didn't like.  

Verdict: It's a great brunch place for vegan and non-vegans alike, but slightly pricier than average. I'd be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So delicious and filling! Make sure you come here hungry! Considering the big portions, the price is great. Really satisfied with the food. Doug himself comes out from the kitchen and checks up on his customers :) nice touch! Would recommend to all vegan AND non vegans to try it out! Make sure to call for reservations on their busy Sunday brunch :)"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the place to find the best vegan and gluten-free food in the city. Doug is the nicest man and will tell you everything about anything and then ring you the most tasty meal. The veggie burger is the best. Actually though. I doubt I will ever find a juicer or more satisfying veggie burger ever. The tostada has every flavour you would ever want in a meal. It's honestly perfection. I could it it every single day. The tofu scramble burrito is so tasty and made me totally reevaluate tofu scramble.
All the to-go foods are equally as awesome. The sweet potato and cauliflower was so good I even liked it cold! And the desserts will bring a single tear to a vegan/gluten-free eye, the peanut butter fudge really did bring a tear to my eye the first time. Not even kidding."}
{"text":"Forget everything you ever thought of with regards to vegan or vegetarian food. Most people when confronted with the prospect of eating in a vegetarian restaurant, immediately think bland tastes and chalky textures.

Upon entering this very unprepossessing establishment, you are immediately struck by the friendliness if the wait staff. They are not only informed about the menu but also have a pretty good knowledge of the composition of the various plates.

Ne prepared for a full sensory experience when eating here. By this, I mean the food is delight to all your five senses. Sight, smell, taste, feel and hearing are all involved in this. From the crunch of the popcorn to the texture of the famous \"neg\" which looks like an egg but is not. The ingredients in all the dishes we sampled were not only organic, but fresh and artisanal. 

I ordered the Pressed Reuben which was an incredible combination of housemade cured shaved seitan corned beef piled high with sauerkraut, topped with russian dressing, melted cashew cheese on thick-cut sourdough olive bread from humblebread, griddled until golden and crisp, choice of house salad or herbed home fries - OUTSTANDING. Bonnie had this incredible Burrito with a chunky guacamole and pico di gallo. Our friends both had the Vegan Benedict which was made with choice of gluten-free or sprouted grain english muffin,
crisp cornmeal and fennel crusted tomato, herbed white wine and garlic spinach, seared smoky sprouted tofu, runny soft poached vegan egg yolk, hollandaise sauce. Our \"app\" was the loaded skins and the coffee was also a delight.

Whatever your thoughts are about this style of cuisine, rethink them after you come here. The plating is worthy of some of the best \"haute cuisine\" I have experienced around the world. Your senses will thank you."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I want to tell people how good this place is because then it will get crazy busy and I'll never get a table!!! Chefs specials are so amazing!! I had the veggie burger and fries,--I was super hungry and this did the trick. Also a big one for me no stomach ache!!! Yeah good food!!"}
{"text":"Who'd knew there is a place like this in this part of the city? Who'd knew a place like this in this part of town would be busy enough that scoring a reservation is a must?

A humble vegan restaurant where water is provided with charcoal so it cleans as you drink (I sound like a tagline for a gasoline chain there lol), as well as free popcorn to keep waiting mouths busy... well, who'd knew they care so much about you feeling good and clean?

I had a brunch meal that consisted of the brunch club sandwich ($17), and also shashuka, an off-the-menu special of the day. The latter was banging tomatoes delicious, and I'm still baffled at how anyone can create a mock vegan-suitable egg with a runny yolk. The sandwich meal was decent, with tofu for eggs and tempeh 'bacon' being the protein substitutes. You have a choice of salad or home fries, the latter making for an overall very filling meal.

There's certainly attention to detail and colours with the dishes, but more so the attention to the vegan, fair trade, organic food philosophy Doug McNish and co. stands for. It's pricey for that matter, but I'm sure you will leave feeling full and good, regardless of whether or not you are a vegan or buy into the clean eating diet or whatever.

The Public Kitchen is the only vegan restaurant for miles, by the looks of it, based on my looking around Yelp for somewhere to eat near that big-fancy-mall-on-a-subway-line (no, not Lawrence Square, which is right up the road). Heck, it's one of a few dining options in the immediate neighbourhood. But they do also sell ready made meals, condiments and such if that's all you need.

{TTC: a short walk around the corner from Glencairn station. Also some parking in the back of the plaza.}"}
{"text":"We stopped at this restaurant while heading to the airport because of the gluten free options. We had the brunch menu and when we tried to order the taco salad the server talked us out of it because it might hurt our stomachs (why is it on the menu then??) maybe it's only for people who can handle raw food? We ordered the potatoes and the banana French toast. The French toast was dry and almost difficult to eat. The potatoes were pretty standard and not worth $8. Overall I found the menu limited and the dishes we were allowed to order were not tasty."}
{"text":"Simply put: you have to try gourmet Vegan to believe it.  I have had the burger on three or four occasions and I am always left marveling at how good it is.  

The PadThai made with zucchini noodles is outstanding- capturing the texture and aroma of 
Thai cuisine perfectly.  Yesterday my wife had the burrito made with tempeh and it was awesome.

They have an expression at Doug's: Good food isn't cheap and cheap food isn't good.  This place can be pricey,  be warned.  But it is outstanding.  Doug is passionate about fair trade and ethical food production, and his store has his cookbooks and accreditations from various fair trade standard commissions.

The quirks- this place isn't open for dinner.  Likely due to cooking classes and other commitments that chef has in the evenings.  So plan ahead and drop by during the day and take out from their prepared food fridge or enjoy a vegan burger in the restaurant.

There is nothing else worth going to in this tiny Marlee and Glencairn neighbourhood- so put aside your Vegan apprehensions and prepare to be impressed."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some vegan food. The place is nice and food is good. However the food is chief food so a bit overpriced for the quantity you get around 20 per person. Also the food suppose to be super healthy of glutin free and other supposedly good stuff which I donot care much about. If you care about those stuff the food is worth it other wise you will find it pricy. Also the place only open weekend at specific timming which is annoying that you can go anytime. Also you can come by week days to grab some pre made food which is also pricy. 

Over all I like the place food is good. However it is a place you visit once a while as it is more pricy and have unique food. Definitely try the vegan eggs when you come."}
{"text":"100% vegan, 1/2 raw and 1/2 cooked.

This place is almost 5 stars, and would be if they were more popular.  It appears Torontonians (Torontonites??) do not yet have enough interest in raw food to support a full-time kitchen.  Currently, they only have a couple items available made-to-order and a couple dozen others available in a display case to-go.  The limited selection of freshly prepared dishes cost them a star.

I tried the made-to-order raw dish (enchiladas I think).  I was impressed enough to pick up one of Doug's raw \"cookbooks\".

I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"On Saturday me and 8 of my friends enjoyed a wonderful brunch here. Everything from the reservation process to paying for our bill went smoothly. I was very impressed with the quality of the food and how much it tasted/resembled the \"original\". It is a bit pricey but like I said, quality food. I got the eggs Benny with a side of tempeh bacon and it was amazing. Next time I think I'll try the breakfast Poutine and the goji latte. Both looked divine. A must go for every vegan looking for something you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Really exceptional vegan, gluten free, healthy, clean food. I love their takeout. Doug seems to be a caring chef who is dedicated to the health of his customers - at a very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Had a birthday brunch here with around 13 friends. The food was great, I had the vegan benedict. All my non-vegan friends enjoyed their meals too. Staff was very nice and the restaurant was very clean. I would go back for sure! 

Popcorn with that nut butter is amazing!"}
{"text":"A tiny spot off Marlee with great staff and a nice buzzing atmosphere. You can sit down to be served a great meal or you can take ready made meals to go. The chef is very personable and asks customers how they liked their meal. 

I had the special which was Mac N Cheese, salad,.and a side of Tempeh Bacon. I loved every bit of the dish, especially the Mac N Cheese which was so creamy."}
{"text":"As I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm not a vegan or a member of the GF movement - but i'm very open-minded to the veg dining experience. I'd heard alot of great things about Doug McNish's innovative recipes and I've enjoyed his cookbook 'Eat Raw Eat Well' so I was excited to join a friend for brunch at the Public Kitchen.


DECOR/AMBIENCE: Simple, bright, and cozy. White walls with posters and articles of Doug's accomplishments, and a wall of shelves lined with his cookbooks, snacks, single ingredients, etc. It was lively and busy when we arrived at 10:30am on a Sunday. I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations on a weekend.


SERVICE: 10/10. His staff are friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. Our waitress was able to rattle off every single ingredient of every dish, describe the cooking processes he'd use, and make recommendations. You can tell his staff are committed to the lifestyle and believe in what they're serving.


FOOD: A true artisan dining experience. Dishes are inventive and hearty enough for a rabid carnivore.
1) Popcorn: Savoury popcorn is served instead of a bread basket.
2) Coffee: Served with coconut sugar (which i'd never tried before, but liked) and almond milk
3) Cinnamon Toast Crunch Smoothie: WOW. Just, wow. Tastes exactly like it sounds, and I'm thrilled that it's in the cookbook I own because this is getting replicated for sure.
4) Negg McNish: A poached \"egg\" served on a sprouted grain english muffin with cashew cheddar cheese, creamy mayo, and ketchup. This is the closest alternative to an egg that I have ever tried, complete with that ooey-gooey runny goodness when cut open. Served with a generous lightly-dressed side salad and a hashbrown patty that was seasoned nicely.
5) Tostadas: A platter of cashew sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, lettuce, and sunflower seed 'refried beans'. The tostadas are a curiously fantastic corn and carrot concoction that is dehydrated until crisp. We loaded them with the fixings and cleared the plate clean.
6) Crepes: Raw apple banana crepes loaded with berries, coconut cream, walnut date crumble, and a cacao fondue. I wasn't crazy about the texture of the crepes and found the flavours a little underwhelming, but my friend really liked it and found it refreshing. 
7) Sundae: Vanilla ice cream with cacao fondue and strawberries. I completely forgot that this was a dairy-free creation. Firm, sweet, and a hint of the underlying coconut base - it was sinfully delicious.


PRICE: Smoothies are $9-12, dishes are $10-17. Considering the quality of the ingredients (all organic too) and the creativity of the dishes, I believe these prices are more or less justified (though smoothie prices seemed a bit steep). Overall, nothing to keep me from coming back again! 


OVERALL: Cozy setting, lively ambience, and delicious dishes. I'd highly recommend Doug's Public Kitchen to anyone vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous. I can't wait to return and continue eating my way through the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan restaurants in the city. Food was excellent, fresh and with a lot of flavour.   
Will definitely be coming back. 

Like the cool water filter. 
The organic hot sauces. 
Portions are huge. 
Staff are super friendly.

Chef McNish does a great job in delivering fresh ideas and meals. 

A famous burger is a must with great sides including sweet potato fries and much more. 

Had the Mexican flair with the burritos and salad. 

There is a fridge of ready made meals which allow you to come and grab what you want to go. 

I'm already on my second visit and I'm looking for more. 

My next round will be to try some of the cooking classes he offers in the fall. 
Sounds like fun."}
{"text":"They have eggs bennies with a popable yolk! Though the best thing I've had so far were their baked potatoes"}
{"text":"Came here for the weekend brunch with three vegans. Wow, the cheesy omelette just blew me away! I wish I knew how to make something just as savoury, delicious and healthy! It came with roasted sweet potatoes and corn, a salad, tempeh 'bacon' and fresh fruit.

Fairly limited seating, so make sure you've got a reservation before you show up on Saturday or Sunday.

The 'coureur de bois' tea, which included juniper, was also quite lovely.

Noise level is a bit much though. The metal chairs and tables don't help.

PARKING: There is a lot in the back, as well as a lot in the strip mall across the street."}
{"text":"First time here as I've heard and read  nothing but good things from friends and reviews. As a vegetarian, I was looking forward to a fulfilling meal and ordered the Goji Berry Latte and Scrambled Tofu: 
 
Likes: 
You get a good amount of food 
Cashew butter was tasty 
Complimentary popcorn 
Outstanding customer service! 

Dislikes: 
Tempeh Bacon tasted like the inside of a butcher shop (that raw meat smell) 
Scrambled tofu was overly seasoned with spices that resembled Indian flavours. Not my thing unless I'm having in the mood for it. Goji Berry Latte was overpowered with cinnamon."}
{"text":"never expected vegan people can enjoy brunch! My non vegan friend already loved it and she's going to ask more ppl to try it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not vegan but I enjoy having different meals and supporting my friends. i have tried many vegan restaurants most just veggies thrown in a salad or on bread nothing to creative that i thought \"wow\" . 
As my vegan friends were dying to have brunch at this place, my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised how nice this meal was. Doug himself was there helping the kitchen and coming out to help the servers as well, he is such a humble passionate man! Hes not to good to to anything, he literally was doing everything right down to cleaning the plates off the tables! 
i give the man 5 starts just for being him, but he is also such a talented chef! 
FOOD:
I had the \"eggs Benedict\", this man made an egg and a yoke out of tofu and black salt (from what i gathered from the conversion) and mineral water. The \"egg\" on top tasted exactly like a real egg. Givin it's a spin on the real thing and can never be an actual egg this was pretty damn close to a real egg. HOW DOES HE DO IT! Its an experience all vegans and non vegans have to try for sure!
My girlfriend had the \"Triple decker brunch burger\"  and it was delicious to say the least every ingredient was fresh and made with care. The \"bacon\" type pieces tasted like Turkey bacon. You can just tell the detail in everything you eat, its not just good food thrown together on a plate. 

Super happy with this brunch place defiantly will go back and try his other restaurant mythology."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on a Saturday with some friends at around 2:00. It wasn't very busy but the food took a long time to come and when it did it was cold. I had the eggs benedict which filled me up because it was a decent portion size but the dish lacked flavour. My friend said her French toast was cold and dry but she liked the yogurt drizzle. 
It was a subpar meal that I paid too much for. I'd recommend going to Fresh for brunch instead."}
{"text":"Amazing food. First time tasting vegan food and was astonished at the flavours. Would recommend this small little eatery to anyone vegan or not!"}
{"text":"We went here last weeks and were disappointed.  I had the quinoa and black bean chilli with   cream and my friend the 'roast beef seitan' sandwich.  Mine was okay but lacking salt and could have done with some oil.  The cashew cream drizzle was so little as to be completely ineffective.  Definitely a 4/10.  Taste-wise nothing to rave about.  My friend's sandwich tasted like turkey stuffing according to him.  My meal was $21.21 and his $22.xx.  Ihave no problem paying for good food and I was okay to pay for mine but I thought my friend's sandwich was completely exorbitant.  We went there based on the reviews.  They were out of the mac and cheese that everyone raves about.  I used to be vegan for six years and cooked far better and tastier food than this without using soy or seitan or any faux products.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"i haven't been to the actual Public Kitchen yet. But i specifically went to Evergreen Brickworks in order to try Doug's food. The mac n cheese with cesar salad was the best new thing i have tried in years that was gluten free/vegan. Even some gluten free/vegan dishes at other places make me feel ill. I think that my body is now reacting to soy. :-( BUT Doug's food was so amazing and the items i choose were perfect/not heavy with soy. I need to get into the brick and mortar location to try more dishes and definitely check out the ready made/take home items. The mac/cheese with side cesar was not only delicous but also affordable. Staff was patient and kind about questions about items/ingredients while i decided what to order. i wish i could afford to eat there every day. I have been eyeing his 3 cookbooks but have doubts about my own ability/patience. The restrictions/reactions/health problems i've been experiencing around food has been seriously challenging. But Doug and his team really deliver great food, with great service and affordable! Awesome combination."}
{"text":"I love love love Doug McNish and it's so amazing to have a totally vegan place in the neighbourhood that also can make (almost) everything gluten free (celiac safe!)!

Food is so creative and I'm always blown away by his vegan 'eggs ' - truly amazing! To be honest, I'm not a fan of the vegan egg or benedict as it's a bit sour for my taste (my bf loves it tho) but in all fairness I barely liked eggs before going vegan.

But this has never been a problem as there are so many other delicious choices on the menu and I've never been disappointed! The vibe of this place is great and the complimentary popcorn is my favourite thing ever. Plus the staff are all so down to earth and friendly. It's a great place to hang on the weekend and always a good crowd. 

We always leave with a take-out box of his vegan mac and cheese (which is the BEST vegan mac you will ever have) and a bunch of other goodies since we can never choose just one. 

If you're vegan you must give Doug McNish a try. And if you are not vegan you also must give is a try so you can see how amazing vegan food can be and how satisfying a meat-less meal can be :)"}

{"text":"Based solely on the one cashew cheesecake I bought. 
Thought this was a restaurant restaurant - good thing were in the area and didnt drive all this way to find out they only serve brunch on the weekends. Throughout the week food is prepackaged and can be bought as a take home or eaten in the seating area. 
I bought the lemon cheesecake and the gf vegan mac and cheese. 
I have not had the mac and cheese yet.

Amazing cheesecake! smooth texture, creamy tasting, bursting with lemon (if you like lemon like I do you will love this). Yet not heavy and it tasted refreshing. 
I'd get this even if I didnt have intolerances to dairy and eggs and gluten. 
And the best part of it is that you dont have that heavy feeling in your tummy after. 
I will update my review after the mac and cheese and when I go again for brunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! Definitely will be coming backThe friendliest servers too!!"}
{"text":"Just visited for veggilisious..  I got the cinnomon toast smoothie, breakfast scramble, and a borsht soup to take home. My friend got the tropic thunder smoothie, the pumpkin waffle, and chili to take home. It was $25 for a main, smoothie, and take home litre soup.

The scramble comes with tempeh, tofu and vegetables, home fries, chili, toast and a spread for the toast.  The scramble  and vegetables were perfectly seasoned, the tempeh tasted maple smoked. I loved the home fries. They weren't hard like you get in some places but soft and seasoned. Good to eat with the tofu. The portion was massive and I ate it all!!!  I'm not a vegan by any stretch but would go back and get this. 
My friend loved her waffle. It was gluten free and dairy free. And despite that she said she would have licked the plate

Can't say enough how wonderful this was.  Its in the middle of nowhere but will for sure be back"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here because the food is delicious and nutritious until I realized the employees are all rude and unwelcoming. The prices increase drastically one day which is fine as I understand prices increase regularly but two employees told me there was no increase. I'm a customer and I know how much I pay for my meals. Not only that - the portion sizes started decreasing drastically too. Go if you are okay with good food but with rude customer service. I don't know if the trade off is worth it."}
