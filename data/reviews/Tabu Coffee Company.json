{"text":"I stopped in to grab a coffee and snack and WOW - the cinnamon almond latte was amazing!  The pumpkin and candy corn cookie was a perfect complement.  I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The coffee was great (I had a double cappuccino with whole milk), the staff was really friendly, but the absolutely best part was the homemade chocolate chip cookies. For $1 each they are a steal, and you should definitely stop by if you're in Cleveland and in the mood for coffee and cookies."}
{"text":"Fantastic non-chain coffee company in the Gateway District right in downtown Cleveland! I stopped here for a decaf soy latte while back in Cleveland for the holiday season. Excellent coffee and customer service. The owner is friendly - great conversation - and an easy place to stop for a coffee on the way to work or an appointment in downtown. Can't wait to try one of the pastries - fresh baked in-house daily."}
{"text":"I just had a peanut butter mocha latte made with actual, honest to goodness peanut butter. I'm not sure what else I need to say... Delicious.   Barista/owner is very friendly and chatty. Didn't mind that although I like coffee, I don't know what exactly I like and I ask a ton of questions. She definitely has the proper personality to run a coffee shop. Very friendly and genuine.   The shop is small, attached to Porcellis. There are a couple of tables. The bakery case made me want to say screw healthy eating. You can just tell by looking that all the deliciousness in that case is homemade. Maybe I will try some in the spring when my new years resolutions have been destroyed."}
{"text":"Little coffee shop where the good coffee sells itself. Espresso was excellent. Great find. So glad I skipped the Starbucks. Simple decor, but if you are more interested in the quality of the coffee, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great coffee, cute little shop. So good to support a mom and pop... A real PERSON! And did I mention the coffee?!?  Yelp map was off by a couple doors, but I found it easily enough.  Had to poke my head in the back to let Leah know I was there - she was baking more of their tasties. Totally, totally worth the effort."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Cleveland, hands down. I make it a point to stop in every time I find myself nearby (which is pretty frequent). Leah is fantastic, her staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, engaging, and welcoming. If you don't know much about coffee, they'll help you figure it out. Their bakery case has several tasty items and they also have smoothies.   It's attached to Porcelli's, and recently upgraded the old booth to a comfortable table - a major improvement.   Do yourself a favor and stop in here instead of Starbucks next time. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Continuing on in my search for downtown's neatest coffee shop, today I visited Tabu. This shop is located on Superior and E 6th St across from the 5/3 Bank Building. Guy's Pizza is immediately on the corner - this is 4th from the corner. The shop shares a door/entry space with Porcelli's Bistro.   I was the only customer and was helped right away by a really friendly and talkative barista. She talked to me the entire time she made my drink and recognized me as not a regular customer which was impressive!   I got a flavored latte special (Salted Carmel). It was advertised as a Salted Carmel Mocha, but the barista offered it to me without chocolate if I preferred and I accepted. She then offered me a choice of milks. After she started making my drink I saw on the sign behind the counter both soy and almond were also advertised; but she didn't offer me those so maybe they were out?   They take credit card via Square. On the emailed receipt I received it said on that bottom that after 10 purchases you get $3.50 off your next purchase! That's a great deal and basically a free drink. That's a better rewards programme than Starbucks! My medium latte was $4.00. The shop also had some cookies and muffins on the counter.   While the shop itself is nothing fancy, and also probably not the best spot for working (there were only 3 tables / 7 seats), the latte was good and most certainly comparable to Starbucks. Coffee shop noise is also probably dependent upon how busy Porcelli's Bistro is."}
{"text":"Had a really fresh espresso from Tabu one afternoon after lunch @ Porcelli's Which is attached to Tabu. Stopped in today for an americano and was pleasantly surprised that Tabu was open and did not have to wait for my beverage. Great service, close to our location and great hours. Definitely recommend."}
