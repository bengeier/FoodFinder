{"text":"Food was not as good as expected, service was about what you expect at at an old time diner! Not a good meal. Kitchen staff should wear a hair net to cover all those dreadlocks!!!! This was our third and worst visit in a week! Kept expecting things to get better! Their \"c\" team works on Mondays I guess!"}
{"text":"I had the mahi mahi with ratatouille and my boyfriend had steak, calamari, and potatoes. We both thought it was delicious!! The service was also great!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed & Overpriced !! - Stopped for Sunday Brunch - sat on the patio, server advised the specials including a Sriracha Bloody Mary - $2.00 more than the regular $4.00 bloody mary so I figure it's got to be something awesome otherwise why would they charge extra $2.00.  She brings, water, bread, & cup of potato soup & finally bloody Mary's which were green (not red as you would expect) but green.  I'm questioning this & was told that it was made of jalapeno's blended with some spices (it tasted more like a green gazpacho) no kick whatsoever and not a hint of Sriracha in site - it was a really horrible Bloody Mary - I didn't even drink half.  The potato soup was okay but rather bland.  Mexican omelet was meh and the potatoes (hash browns) were bad - chunky potatoes with huge chunks of green pepper & onion, cooked to death.  Topping it off was the poor, slow service.  Never asked if we wanted refills on water  and when she finally dropped the check I looked and we were charged $8.00 each for the previously stated $6.00 special bloody marys .  She did not come out to get the payment so I finally took the check inside beause I think she must be terribly busy to not come and check on us.  There was 1 other table inside, 3 or 4 outside with at least 3 servers.  I really can find no excuse for this terrible service or overpriced food/drinks.  I'd much rather go to Wine Shop or Just Fresh - won't be back to RiverBleu."}
{"text":"Best experience I've had in a while! Food was amazing!  There is some real talent in the kitchen. I had the maple leaf duck breast and it was just wonderful."}
{"text":"Second visit and happy this time, too. Last time had the catfish & this time the mahi. I would get both again. Hubby has gotten filet both times & this time also got a delicious lobster tail. Both times the waitstaff has been very attentive and informative."}
{"text":"Used a groupon, probably the first mistake since the server assumed a \"you don't really matter to me\" attitude as soon as we sat and I told him we had a groupon. (Disclaimer - we are a middle aged couple who have traveled all over the world and who enjoy decent dining). We live in this area and often visit Rivergate shopping center (we've been here over 15 years and remember this area as a farm with a 2 lane road running south). 

The reason for the 2 rating is the food is a 4. Filet Mignon and truffled Macarroni and cheese were great. However, the service was at best a 0.5. The waiter, though there were only 5 other tables eating in the whole place and there were at least 3 waiters, was deplorable (sorry for that word, haven't moved beyond the election). After sitting for 30 minutes with the beginning drink and nothing else, my wife wondered aloud if bread was served. So, I volunteered to go to the mens room and check the other few tables. They all had bread. When I got back, still no bread but the food was served. When the waiter finally reappeared, I asked for bread and he said \"oh, you wont bread?\" Then we proceeded to get no drink refills until I finally had to flag him down for the bill. 

I would not recommend, there are much better places in Charlotte for the price."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Had the crab cakes, they were the best crab cakes I have had in the Charlotte area!  For my main entree, had the scallops with risotto -wonderful. Service was great! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great dining  experience,  from the wait staff to the presentation  and attention  to detail.  Accommodated my husband's  gluten free requirements  and nailed the calamari.  Agree that it is the best in the Lake Wiley area!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week on the 2nd day they were open and then again for lunch a few weeks later.  Both times the food was very good, although there were a few kinks they need to work out with some of the menu items.  I think it definitely has potential, but they will need to work hard to justify the prices which are on the higher side for the area."}
{"text":"We ate there last night around 5:45 so before the rush. Staff were polite but not very professional; didn't know the food items on the menu, had not tasted many of the entrée's & was pretty obvious she was new to food service. Appetizers were good but very small. Entrée's were tasty but small & overpriced. The \"grilled\" shrimp were boiled & the scallops were about the size of a quarter. When we commented that the shrimp were not grilled, our server agreed, said she would check the menu--and she did! But no manager came by, no chef, no nothing! She just agreed that the \"shrimp should have had those little lines on them.\""}
{"text":"Went here last night, atmosphere and service were great but the food just lacked the quality to justify the price. Fried calamari was soggy and bread was stale and crumbly. They added peas to both dishes (sea scallops and chicken carbonara), despite not being listed in the menus description. Chicken was very good and scallops were good too. Was charged $9 for adding grilled jumbo shrimp to my entree, what I received was 4 small shrimp that didn't seem grilled. 

Overall food was good but certainly lacked the polish and quality that you'd expect at their prices. I would rate 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just had dinner at this location and I have to say that the customer service was AWFUL. We asked to be seated outside as its a beautiful night and we watched 3 waitressed walk right past us - no greeting - nothing until I got up went back inside and asked if we needed to be seated inside to get the appropriate service. We finally had a lovely person named Brittany - who has the be the one that cares there - take over our table as the nonchalant waitress who did have our table never came to apologize for not making it to us. Brittany tried her best. At one point I asked to speak to the manager - who came over - I explained the issue, be proceeded to stare at me and ask me if there was \"anything else I needed\". Needless to say - we paid the check - left Brittany a stack of cash as a tip for trying and I will ensure my company recruits her to get her out of a place that CLEARLY has no concept of service. I WOULD NOT SPEND A DIME HERE EVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Friendly and courteous staff. Food overpriced and not appetizing or appealing. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Seriously unimpressed. Very slow service, mediocre food, wait staff doesn't listen to the order. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived at 1:30pm, and we should have taken that as a sign. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on Valentine's Day without an reservation, which probably wasn't the best idea. Nonetheless, the atmosphere was Great we ended up at the bar which was full service. Food was very good and with exceptional service from the bar. The only negative was the host that kept telling us that all the tables are reserved and its Valentine's Day! Yes we knew that! He would had us walk out of my husband had not mentioned the bar area. 
Overall, we will try it again with a reservation!"}
{"text":"While sitting at the bar enjoying my dinner two servers were complaining about the bartenders being slow, yet they wouldn't run their own drinks for their tables. When the manager was standing behind the other side of the wall yelling at the bartenders in front of customers saying he could find two more to replace them. I shouldn't have to sit here and listen to the manager degrade the bartenders when no one will help them with things they need. I don't appreciate listening to such rude comments while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. The staff are so young and know nothing about the restaurant or menu. The food is way over priced and never comes out fully cooked. Stay away from this place. It's horrible!"}
{"text":"Unless you have 4 hours to eat, don't go.  Then they offered some little desert for all the time wasted.  And they charged me.  It was a good attempt, but really not worth the 100$ for an iffy dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Server argued with us regarding our order. Food was not prepared or presented in a good manner. Manager was apathetic."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and wasn't so please. They really need to adjust their price and retrain their staff.  Almost $3 for soft drinks? We had to sent back all our filet mignon. We order medium and it over done to the max. Second time, it was rare. Won't be going back. I don't see this restaurant lasting long"}
{"text":"First time eating at Riverbleu and it was excellent. I ordered a filet which wasn't on the lunch menu but they were more than happy to cook one anyway.  The steak was cooked just right and the mashed potatoes and vegetables were delicious.  I didn't catch our waiter's name but he was very personable and laid back.

Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Don't sleep on this place folks..this place has one of the best happy hours ever! Half off apps until 6:30! and they are all great! On Tuesdays the have half off bottles or glasses of wine (don't recall) but I had two glasses and my bill was a wopping $8 
bucks. On Thursday's they have half off martini's and the bartender knows how to make a drink! You will not be disappointed. Great service and supper friendly staff! Check it out if you are in the Steel Creek area. Nothing else compares."}
{"text":"How can I even begin to explain the amazing texture and flavor of the mushroom risotto that accompanied the pan seared barramundi WITH SKIN ON! Yes, for those of you that love an adventurous meal and a fantastic flavor please try this dish! How the combination of the fish and risotto blended was perfect. The risotto was like non other I have had, and I make a mean mushroom risotto. The sauce may initially seem to be very buttery and overpowering, but I would be excited to know if you can pick out the several flavors they have Infused and incorporated into it. Awesome!! The crunchiness with the smooth delicious fish, covered in a buttery velvet sauce topped with asparagus, adding the crunchy flavor of the skin and mental/flavor overload of amazingness. When I saw the fish served skin side up on top of the risotto I lit up like a kid getting a red rider BB gun...WOW! Presentation is nice and the flavor blows my mind! Enjoy with a good beer such as The Unknown over the edge :)

The service here is also very friendly and great! I always appreciate a great feel to the environment. Thank you for a great experience and I look forward to returning to try the elusive fish and chips...

Thank you Caitlin for the awesome service and thank you Travis for an amazing dish!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice server and nice atmosphere, but the Restrooms were really dirty.  Crab cake Benedict was very good.  Nice brunch menu.  Spicy chicken soup was also good and make sure to ask for the bread before hand....it was very tasty with oil dip."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time (or money) on this place. It's understaffed (a fact the servers will gladly share when you're greeted) which leads to long waits for everything and the food is overpriced for the mediocre product that is served. Examples included overcooked lobster tails (a $31 mistake to order) and a burger ordered medium-rare which was cooked- not surprisingly- medium-well. Noticeably absent was any managerial presence- which was somewhat surprising as the restaurant was only about one-third full and should have enabled an opportunity for a manager to stop by and learn what customers were thinking. Perhaps there wasn't a manager around during those ninety minutes we suffered through our meal."}
{"text":"The food was good service was great.   Drinks were horrible.  I ordered 2 specialty drinks at $10 each.  I should have quit at the first but I tried a different drink thinking it would be good.  Possibly the first was a fluke.   It was just as horrible.    Bartenders need to be trained.  Especially when I am paying $10 per drink."}
{"text":"Service was terrible....seemed like it was everyone's first night. Steaks were extremely over cooked, portion sizes are tiny, especially for the price. Paid over $100 for a mediocre meal at best. Needless to say, we won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Just had their sunday brunch....excellent, smoked salmon, cheese, omelets, shrimp, and much more.The service was great, finally a good place to eat breakfast on this side of town, ranks up there with wadhorn"}
{"text":"We ate at Riverbleu for the first time last week. The menu is mostly seafood. I had the Chicken Carbonara and my company had the swordfish special.  The quality and flavor was fair. I felt the menu is overpriced for the food selection, taste, location, etc."}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced. You cant charge that amount of money with average food and below average service. Crab dip was too salty. BBQ pork was tough and sauce was bland. Mahi was really good. Waitress was extremely shy, they definitely need to train their staff better."}
{"text":"Overpriced and undergood, but at least you'll have plenty of time to chat while you wait. It didn't seem like much of a crowd tonight, but maybe I'm wrong. The guy that appeared to be acting like a manager stopped by the other tables to explain, but not ours, so I can't say. My ten minute steak took a little over half an hour, which is understandable, since it was overdone. The mashed potatoes were missing something; namely cream or butter, or something to help it less resemble a diced baked potato. 

I didn't try my wife's burger, but she only made it through about half of it, so it didn't seem worth the effort. 

The drinks were good"}
{"text":"I had a birthday meal here and was well impressed. The mussels in white wine sauce were good and the filet was a nice main. The wait staff was excellent. This is an excellent addition to the steele Creek area and absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've eaten in the Lake Wylie area.  So glad I no longer have to drag myself up to Charlotte for a really good meal, and that we have a place to bring guests for fine dining close to home.  I will definitely be back.  

Pros:
Deeee-licious food!
Nice, relaxing atmosphere.
Very friendly and attentive staff.
Food was served quickly (too quickly!)
Nothing over-seasoned or too salty
Tasty martini
Generous portions

Cons:
Food was served much too quickly--no time to linger.
Prices were maybe a little too high for this area, but it is definitely worth it.
Bread was rather crumbly--didn't survive dredging in the tasty olive oil.

Hubs and I decided to give this place a go last Sunday evening. We hadn't been out to dinner in a long time, and we really needed \"Us Time.\" There were only about 4 other patrons--guess it was a slow night.  We were greeted warmly and promptly seated in a booth.  Our server quickly welcomed us and took our drink order, which arrived almost immediately (yay!).

I ordered the Parisian Martini which was quite perfect actually--A generous serving, not a syrupy sweet girly martini, very generous with the vodka, and icy cold. Let's just say I ordered two that evening.  Martinis are $10--a little pricey.  Then again, like I said, it was a generous serving and probably one of the best martinis I've had in a long time.

No sooner did I have my first martini in hand than the appetizers were delivered.  The Fried Oysters Rockefeller ($11) did not disappoint.  Six plump, juicy, and cooked-just-right oysters; served over a bed of warm spinach with tomato and onion confit and a little dab of garlic aioli on top--very tasty.  The large cup of She-Crab Soup ($11) was rather disappointing, unfortunately. More the consistency of a dip rather than a soup or even a bisque, we were tempted to just dip our bread in it instead of using spoons.  It was mildly flavorful with extra-large chunks of crab, which is a must, of course.  They just need to back off on whatever they're using to thicken it up.  Also, there was no evidence of sherry, which should be drizzled table-side, ideally.  Yes, I am a snob.

Meanwhile, a warm, cake-like bread, cut into large squares, was served along with a seasoned olive oil for dipping.  The bread and oil dip were yummy, but the bread was too crumbly to survive being dredged in olive oil.  I would have preferred a yeasty bread that held up better to a good sopping.

Maybe only 5 minutes after we finished the apps, dinner was served.  I really could have used a little break to let the filling appetizers settle a bit and to savor the martini.  But, well, onward and upward, I say!

I can't remember the name of what hubby ordered, but it was a trio of a petite filet mignon, grilled shrimp, and a crab cake, served over mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked exactly as requested and the shrimp served lightly seasoned and tender.  The crab cake was quite the let-down--way too much filler and not much crab at all.  To me, a good crab cake is barely held together.  I really hope they improve this, as crab cake is one of my all-time favorite indulgences.

I was really looking forward to my Seared Diver Sea Scallops ($27) with corn, leek, and shrimp risotto and a champagne mustard vinaigrette.  Big, fat scallops, taken off the heat at just the right time.  Creamy risotto with sweet, tender corn.  I wanted to lick my plate clean, but I resisted.

At this point, we were completely stuffed.  But we were so pleased with what we'd had so far, we just had to see what they had for dessert.  My hubby is inherently sweet, so he's not much of a dessert person (altogether now:  awwwww!), but he ordered his favorite anyway:  creme brulee.  Although the menu said it was a white chocolate creme brulee, we both agreed we couldn't detect the chocolate--that it tasted like a simple creme brulee.  Then again, white chocolate has a rather mild flavor.  Regardless, it was scrumptious (and large enough for sharing).  Hubby's only complaint was that the caramelized top was a little too thick--I'd have to agree.  I went all in:  Chocolate torte.  O.  M.  G.  I'd been craving chocolate cake for the better part of a week, and this beat that craving into submission.  The scoop of icy, delicately-coffee-flavored ice cream was a perfect sidekick.

I hope to God this restaurant makes it.  I had all but given up on the Lake Wylie/Steele Creek restaurant scene until our meal at River Bleu the other night.  Yes, there are other decent dining options nearby, but none that take it up to this level.  I can't wait to go back and to bring my friends.  :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our visit to this restaurant. Our burger was extremely salty and well done when ordered medium. Service was not good. Manager wasn't sent over to hear the complaints. Not the best first impression for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Yuck!  $200 and that is the nicest way I can describe the steak.  It steak was tender but they were very poor cuts.  They looked like they belonged on a cheap steak sandwich.  I went with my wife and kids and we had 4 steaks and all were very unevenly cooked and completely raw in some spots.  When we showed the waiter, his response was that we could take it with us and the dog would love it.  He wasn't being rude.  He was actually serious.  There was no offer to put it back on the grill or let us select something else.  It was going to be a good night for the dog...  We were so shocked that we just looked at each other, speechless.  The waiter was nice but seemed very nervous and lacked the finesse that you might expect at a \"nice\" restaurant.  I wish I had a better experience but this was so bad that there is no way I would ever try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Undercooked steaks with surf and turf. No excuse for Undercooked steaks in such a rated place. All kids working there and horrible management. Just all around bad meal and bad experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great burgers!!! Farm fresh beef and crispy bacon. Children's chicken tenders were good too."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant during Charlotte's restaurant week. We made reservations for 7pm, and even though it was a Friday night, they weren't necessary. We were greeted and seated in under ten minuets. 

Our waitress was very kind and carful not to make us feel rushed. I had the appetizer dish with the Brussel Sprouts, bleu cheese, and kale. **There are nuts in this dish** Due to dietary restrictions I got mine without the nuts and bacon. It was a really good dish. The way the Brussel sprouts are cooked in such a way that  even someone who doesn't like them, like my husband, would enjoy them (he did). 
For my main entree, I had the blackened salmon with potatoes and creamed spinach. This was probably some of the best blackened salmon I have had in a while. I was a little disappointed in the desserts. I tried both the creme brûlée and the berry sorbet. I wasn't impressed. Over all very nice restaurant with very good food."}
{"text":"Beautifully apportioned interior was just a delightful setting for a delicious meal on a quiet night. The oysters rockafeller were nuanced and executed wonderfully.  The duck flew in after that and it was quacking awesome, very well paired with a corn cranberry creation giving some sweet with the savory sort of thingy that always makes me think \"smack your momma good\".  I finished with the bread pudding and coffee whereupon I died. 
I dont remember her name but we were extremely well taking care of. She did everything i asked and didnt over talk or over serve. Great experience. Thanks RB I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back. Overpriced and not worth it. could have went to Sullivan's for same price or less and had better food.

also had an allergic reaction to a sauce in the tuna and they didn't even attempt to comp anything so we will not be going back and I WILL NOT recommend this establishment to anybody.

Bubba"}
{"text":"Our 2nd time here - disappointed again.  She-crab soup without much crab & very bland, lemon wine sauce without lemon or wine, and portion sizes small.  The waitress went back to the kitchen & tasted the lemon wine sauce, confirming that it was totally void of flavor, but apparently the kitchen didn't feel they needed to address it for us.  Our first experience was similar, but we gave them a second chance.  There won't be a third."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting in the restaurant because I couldn't wait until later to write a review. My service was absolutely horrible. While my food was great and seasoned, it was cold. When I attempted to let the manager know, he was extremely rude. He came to the table and says \"What's up?\" takes the food and brings back hot food later. No apology, no introduction, nothing. Food is great, service is the WORST I've encountered in a very long time."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent! I had the Bleu cheese topped sirloin with Yukon mashed potatoes and a house salad. My husband had the filet and a caesar salad. Steaks were cooked perfectly! Service was on the ball... We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to opening night last night on a whim.  We waited 40 minutes for any food to come out at all, including bread.  Going with the menu for restaurant week I had the shrimp appetizer, cheese ravioli, and creme brulee. My husband had the Caesar salad, filet mignon, and key lime pie.  The shrimp appetizer was delicious but the Caesar salad was not the best I've tried.  My cheese ravioli was great as was the filet.  The potatoes with the filet tasted like boxed potatoes to me.  Dessert was just okay. Nothing special.  The ambiance was nice and it wasn't very crowded.  I gave 3 stars because I would go back but I am not in a hurry to.  The food was good just not to the point of being a favorite. Side note: we took our 6 yr old twins and they had cheeseburger and pasta with marinara.  They ate the food and said it was good.  No crayons,stickers, or anything for kids so bring your own entertainment."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on Valentine's Day at noon. It was pretty empty at that time. But strangely the coffee served was lukewarm. Carla our waitress can only give us half filled coffee. Had to make more. I wasn't sure if this is her 1st time. She seem like she have quite find her flow yet. It took a minute. 
I ordered the steak and sunny side up! It was really good. Came with an order of fruit and potatoes which was a really nice touch. They also included a muffin which was very sweet. I didn't care for it! 
My son ordered hot chocolate. He didn't like it. Just tastes like hot milk.. He also ordered the waffle with bacon. He ate it but didn't finish. Overall he didn't complain like he did with the \"hot milk\" so I'm taking this as a thumbs up! 

Overall it was a good experience. I wouldn't mind going back for dinner to check out their menu some more!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! We went during restaurant week and it was only their second day open. We we're impressed! The manager said the food needed some work so we be back to see improvements in a few weeks. We had the following seared tuna, shrimp appetizer with great broth and crab soup that was a little thick but great flavor. Entrees were the scallops with risotto, filet with mashed potatoes and goat cheese crusted chicken which all were delicious. Desert was white chocolate creme brûlée ... Yummy and sorbet which was very refreshing. The key lime pie was ok. They do all deserts in house which is refreshing for this restaurant. Excited for this new restaurant in the Steelecreek area!"}
{"text":"To start the wait staff were attentive and seated us quickly....it was a Monday however. The food was great and throughout the meal our waiter and the staff remained attentive to our needs. The ambience was great. I would dine here again. I'll have to come back a few times to give it 5 stars just to see if this remains consistent."}
{"text":"Bartender staff okay, manager over bearing and in the way! Food mediocre at best. Steak and Lobster, steak cooked perfect MR, lobster overcooked and dry, potatoes and asparagus cold as a refrigerator. Trio, ordered MR came cold rare, crab cake was crap, potatoes and veggie cold. In bathroom one of the cooks was in there, proper procedures  should be was hands twice washed, not! Love the ambiance , will go back for half price wine and go across the parking lot to eat at other much better venues. Owners need to take a cold hard look!"}
{"text":"Called ahead to ensure gluten free options would be available. Talked W/ G.M.(Bost) & assured us they could accommodate us. arrived early & were seated immediately. Waiter appeared nervous, & anxious. As, we awaited our friends to join us we studied the menu, wine list looked affordable. After our friends arrived & drinks were ordered we noticed a lot of employees running around (staff seemed un-familiar with the menu). One of their signature drinks did not have all ingredients available to make properly. Ordered an appetizer (brie) which, was delicious. Ordered a pear & bleu cheese salad which, was ample but, seemed to be missing the balsamic but, not the oil. 2 (fried) seafood platters were satisfying. 1 Ravioli  Meal ordered (small portion but, good).1 Filet Mignon also ordered as a gluten-free option w/ herb mushroom potatoes but. arrived w/ fries. Plus,an additional side (Roasted Brussel Sprouts & Beets). Sent back & manager arrived quickly w/ corrected order in hand. Brussel Sprouts Side had the flavor of gas (grill).Had to ask for water refills. Bread never made it to our table! Overall, satisfied but, they definitely have some kinks to work out. Plan to return !"}
{"text":"We had a not so good experience with a waitress at The Wine Shop in Rivergate and left our table before ordering and decided to try out the new River Bleu. We were pleasantly greeted and sat outside. Our waitress was INSTANTLY amazing and was giving our 4 yr old a high five and even got her a bandaid for her boo boo for her scraped knee she got before we went there. Anyways, Amy restored our faith in customer service and how you should be treated at a restaurant. Amy went above and beyond. We will definitely be back and we'll definitely be sitting in her section. 

Also, the food was AMAZING!

Great service, great food! That's all we ask for!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good place that verges on greatness. They have an interesting menu with some nice ingredient selections. Drinks are creative and good except. Bad side, they routinely cool things medium rare when you say medium. Be insistent and send it back if it doesn't come out right."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this new place on my end of town. They took over the old City Tavern spot in Rivergate and same owner as Bernardin's uptown. The food is good and I would go back for that. Filet was cooked as ordered and was very flavorful. The place is very loud---others have commented on this so hopefully they will do something about it."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time & it will be my last.  The cook was having a bD day.  I ordered the crab dip and it was dry,  full of Pablo and NO CRABMEAT.  We both ordered steak & shrimp.  Chef left off my shrimp,  no sauce that came with it.  My sister steak was burnt, the vegetables were salty and we sent it back.  The manager only came to bring her another steak that was still OVERCOOKED. The manager never apologize or took off for the lunch. He didn't even talk with us about the constant incident.  Unfortunately, customer service is not priority at this restaurant.  The excuse form the waitress, \" the cook didn't come in & our truck came in therefore, the sou chef trying to cook and unload the truck.\" This is NOT THE CUSTOMER ISSUES & how poor the food & customer service speaks greatly about this establishment.  I hate my 1st experience was none other than a disaster and poor.  I expected more from Management,  but again this speaks alot about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great! I had a couple of issues but the GM handled it wonderfully and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wrote most of this in my checkin but very nice place great food choices mushroom soup was great, steak and scallops were very flavorful. The place looks clean tidy and a casual dinning vibe. Nice to have somewhere other than a sports bar close to home"}
{"text":"Great lunch at this place. We have been a few times.  Great burgers and brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at the new Riverblu today with 6 of my friends.  When we arrived at 12:30, were seated at a large oval table, directly under a speaker.  The music was very loud.  We asked for it to be turned down, but it was not.  

The waiter, very young and seemingly inexperienced, stood at the end of the table to take our orders, and we could not hear what he was saying.  If this is being billed as a fine restaurant, shouldn't he have walked to each person individually to take their order?  

The food arrived after quite a long wait.  Was beginning to think they had to send out for it.  When it did finally arrive, mine was little more than room temperature.  I asked for well done fries, and they were beautifully done, just not hot. My club sandwich (grilled chicken and bacon) was lukewarm also. The food tasted good, but hard to enjoy when not hot..

The atmosphere is casual, I understand that, but while we were eating, the manager walked by and yelled (How's everything \"girls\")!   Somebody needs to teach him to use \"ladies\", especially to a group of over 70 year old women.

It also took forever to get our check and pay our tabs.  Almost 2 hours to eat sandwiches and fries.

The slowness of service, the treatment of patrons, the incredibly loud music and the cold food ensures I will never return."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Duck with coconut jasmine rice, and vegetables. It was so good. I'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great... Nice low lightings. The food though... Not of fine quality. I had the seared scallops. It was over cooked and the ends were burnt. You will not see the burnt ends on the photo because they were turned over to the bottom of the plate. What you will see is the small sizes. For the price they charged, I was expecting fuller and bigger sizes. These looked like they were cut in half. They were salty and tasted like they were seared on butter that was burnt... Like they melted the butter on too hot a pan and then they tossed the scallops in. 
The staff seemed confused and we're constantly bringing wrong orders to other patrons' the table. It's like they had rearranged the restaurant and didn't know where the food was supposed to go.
I ate something bad... I was not feeling well when I got home. I went home and threw up!
The she crab soup could of had more crab in it. The surf and turf... Steak was average. And for a \"steak and fish\" restaurant, there were only two steaks on the menu. A fillet and a flat iron. Need more selection on the red meats. Will not go back..."}
{"text":"We had a significant wait. After being seated it took over an hour and half for our entrees. Food was ok until my husband bit into a bug.  That really ruined it for us and they offered us a gift card which my husband declined;however their cucumber coolers were delicious!"}
{"text":"Our story.........We were pleasantly greeted and promptly seated by a polite hostess. Our server Kyle introduced himself in a friendly professional manner. He balanced getting us a delicious family style app of calamari and tuna with drinks and frankly we were out of sync yet he gracefully managed to orchestrate the experience. We were impressed by his professionalism and this lasted throughout the evening. The timing and flow of courses excellent. Entrees were enjoyed by all. My steak temp was excellent, plate presentation excellent, portion size excellent. Sous Chef Nick made a brief appearance that was quite nice, professional and friendly. We told the staff it was a birthday celebration and with perfect timing a sampler dessert plate for our party of five arrived. Our party all enjoyed the food and drinks. 
Our evening is now a terrific memory of a nicely appointed room, excellent service and delicious food shared with great family."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for Charlotte Restaurant Week and had a reservation for 6 people. At the last minute we had an additional person join and the staff was very accommodating and got us a new table right away. Really appreciated that! I had the crab dip and Caesar for starters. The dip was AMAZING!! My friend from Maryland (a crab snob lol) loved it as well. Salad was good, it's just a Caesar lol...I did have to pay extra to add anchovies to mine but only 50 cents. For my entree I had the surf and turf...it was good. I loved the potatoes and the shrimp! The steak was good but not the best I've ever had. And for dessert I had the cinnamon bun bread pudding....WOOOOWWW! It was amazing! Just the perfect blend of cinnamon, sugar, bread and ice cream ever. Overall, really enjoyed this place, the food, the service, everything....would definitely go back on a regular evening."}
{"text":"Nice place but the food and pricing needs help! $6.00 for 2 iced teas??? $9.00 Reuben with hardly any meat. She crab soup was bland at best. The salad with rare tuna was flavorless. The calamari was good. We were over charged on our bill. $20.00 for a house salad with maybe 3 to 4 oz of tuna........ Really? Sorry folks but our lunch was not worth $50.00. #anotheronebitesthedust!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  I've had a bit of everything and everything is fantastic.  Their Sriracha Burger is to die for and their Fried Brussels and Kale Salad made me question the meaning of life.  Freaking amazing food.  

Now their bar is also a huge find if you love local craft beer. They have a smidgen of everything. They also have $3.50 pints and Half Price Appetizers on Wednesdays.  Great deal.  And by the way the Kale Salad of the gods I mentioned above is considered an appetizer.

Now, outside of the great food and beer it should be noted that their daily prices aren't for the faint at heart.  I love to eat out, but this joint is just a bit more pricey than I can justify for a casual meal ... except on Wednesday's!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner.  My husband got duck and I had the steak.  The food was okay.  Definitely overpriced. We weren't really impressed and definitely expected more for the price."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Thursday with 8 people from work. Overall the place has a nice ambiance and we waited at the bar for the whole party to get there and the bartender was really cool.

I ordered the ribeye medium- rare with spinach and was very happy with it. The steak was cooked perfectly with a nice char and plenty of fat to mix up the bites. There was a surprisingly large amount of spinach which was a nice since I find a lot of times I could use a bit more vegetable. Most people at the table got a steak and everyone enjoyed their meal so overall I can't knock this place."}
{"text":"We definitely liked this place,  service was great and pretty fast.  The food was very tasty and the portions in our opinion were perfect.   You did not leave over stuffed.   I had the River Bleu triplet, everything was cooked to our liking.   We thought pretty good for the prices.   We were finished as the girl started playing her live music but it seemed like a fun pkace to sit and have a drink as well, they also have outdoor seating.   If in the Steele Creek area and looking for a nice place to take a date or friend I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I recently purchased a groupon for River Bleu and the experience was amazing! The salmon and the shrimp & grits were delicious. Our waitress, Kayla, was very friendly and knowledgeable. We enjoyed every minute with her. Also, the bottomless mimosas were a bonus. I will definitely drive 30 minutes again to eat here! My only suggestion is to extend the hours."}
{"text":"The stir fry was delicious! The waitress, Kayla was beautiful, knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and very cordial.  Our overall experience was FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Lol! This place is straight TRASH. I ordered the Salmon burger and the burger had NO SALMON! Haha like whaaaaaat brah? I don't even leave reviews but had to let everyone know to stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Thursdays are $5 martinis, how could you go wrong with a seasonally inspired martini?! Well, I'll save you some time and just tell you... you can't. We sat at the bar and enjoyed some apps. The bartender was AWESOME. She was so friendly and was happy to share her local IPA knowledge with us. Don't miss the oysters Rockefeller, they were amazing. 
I've been promised bottomless mimosas at brunch, so you know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I are always looking for \"The one\" in the restaurant world, well this isn't it.  Prices are Waaayyyyy to high for what you get. Service was absolutely ridiculous. You never, ever, take a plate away when someone is about to take a bite from it, (appetizer). My tea sat empty so long that ice melted and I drank that. No, I'm not asking for a refill, at the prices they're trying to get I feel they should be paying attention to things like that. You know how many times I've asked for more drink at DelFriscos? Never. There were four of us. Tried the calamari, tough and chewy, seasoned well though. Tried the Brie, this was actually very good Brie but they need to learn how to plate it better. The side items that came with it were in containers that were useless. Entree was scallops with risotto. Those of you who've made it this far in my review already know that \"good\" risotto is not easy business and unless someone back there knows how to do it, they just shouldn't. They did and shouldn't have. Wife had the ravioli, it was decent. I can't remember what our friends had but one said theirs was good other said it just \"ok\". I always give a new place a second chance but they'd better step it up or they'll end up like Hoffa. 
Note: I give honest opinions on what was experienced by myself and company and I always tip, even with service like this. I love writing glowing reviews because to me, great food is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"We had the cinnamon french toast and the Bleu breakfast. While components were good, the fresh fruit was not ripe, our forks would not even puncture any of the pieces. The bacon on the Bleu breakfast never did show up and we couldn't ask the server as the service left little to be desired. Our meal was placed in front of us, the server quickly left without asking if we needed anything else. She continued to pass the table, not acknowledging ours (I noticed she did this with her other tables as well). Our drinks ran dry and we had to ask the hostess for jelly, which she informed us they didn't have any but they could provide fresh strawberries (see previous comment about the fruit not being ripe). Our server overheard her and corrected her stating they have strawberry jelly. 

Overall, decent food and very unattentive service... that's reason enough for us to not return."}
{"text":"This was great choice! If you Ike seafood this is one of the better options in the Charlotte area in terms of price and service! I ordered the twin lobster tails, with ceased salad and mac n cheese, and added the crab cake. The lobster was sweet and cooked just right which quite a few restaurants just can't get right and by itself would have earned them a five. The mac n cheese was good, as well as the crab cake, but they were average bringing g it to a four star rating, but definitely worth a try! Hope to experience the same when I go back for the lobster again!"}
{"text":"Portions are small, prices are high. Food was bad, some of it reminded me of frozen food. Service was so painfully slow!

Blackberry Collins: decent drink, a bit heavy on the lime juice, but probably the best thing about my meal.

She-crab soup: weirdly thick, tasted like cream of seafood condensed soup.

Spinach salad with chicken: chicken was cooked perfectly, but unseasoned. The whole dish needed salt. Almost no bacon & very few tomato pieces. Spinach was very wilted. Pears were definitely out of a can. Small portion, but I couldn't finish it because it tasted so bad. I left very hungry.

Guinness: bottled beer, completely flat

Riverblue trio: steak was small but nicely cooked. Asparagus was steamed & unseasoned. The 3 shrimp were delicious. The crab cake was tiny & coated in a fish-stick type breading. Tasted like it was previously frozen."}
{"text":"Disappointing and disorganized establishment. Ate dinner here tonight with family (6 total). Ordered the crab dip appetizer, which was a small portion, and it was mostly cream cheese and diced onions swimming in a ton of butter and oil. It was gross. We were seated shortly before 6pm and the restaurant was not busy at all, and our food arrived ONE HOUR after we placed the order. Two people in our party ordered the Gyro Burger. As the food was delivered to the table, we were told by server: \"I was just informed by the kitchen that they are out of tzatski sauce\", the key ingredient that makes this a \"gyro burger\". I'm not sure why the chef 1) didn't inform anyone of this beforehand- especially the waitstaff, or 2) didn't run over to Publix for ingredients for this sauce.. which are yogurt, dill, and cucumber (which we know they had, it was on the salads). Either way, no manager or chef came to the table to explain this, just made the poor server explain this and offer no discount or consolation. And at that point, the food was at the table, and no one wanted to risk waiting another hour, so it was peacefully eaten. One person in our party ordered the ribeye, which was decent, but cooked well-done rather than medium-rare. The mac and cheese was fine, yet not even a large enough portion to fill half of the bowl. One person ordered the entree caesar salad with chicken (+$6 extra I believe) and no joke, the amount of flavorless chicken on top of that salad was equivalent to a McDonalds chicken nugget. Again, we were all so hungry at this point that we ate the food in front of us and got out of there. Tonight was a comedy of errors and it appears the place is poorly managed. I wanted to badly to have a great experience and I don't believe we will be able to return."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for a romantic dinner and we were amazed at how good the food was.  Amy our server was kind and courteous and treated us very well.  The food tastes very fresh and the prices are reasonable.  This is downtown dining without the downtown hassle.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for our 10 yr anniversary and had a great experience. Our server Tabitha went above and beyond to make it special. We had calamari and she crab soup to start with and the duck for the entree. Everything was delicious! Then for dessert they gave us complimentary dessert of our choice and two complimentary glasses of champagne."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets mediocre reviews but our recent visit was fantastic. The service and food was top notch. We had the sweet shrimp crostini to start that were delicious but could have been a bit larger to share. I enjoyed the Grilled Sriracha Mahi Mahi which was phenomenal! My husband loved the Short Ribs and also the spinach bacon  salad. Another family member had the house salad with crab cakes which were perfect! They had glasses of wine for 1/2 off and the desserts were just right too. We really enjoyed ourselves and will be going back to visit!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our move to the Steele Creek area and unfortunately left underwhelmed with the experience. It wasn't that it was a terrible experience but for the upscale dining atmosphere and price it completely missed the mark. 

We were promptly seated when we arrived for an 8:00pm Saturday dinner in a half full restaurant. We ordered a bottle of Cotes-du-Rhone and the waitress returned with Malbac, which we didn't initially notice because she was unable to get the bottle open and had to have another waitress help. The wine was fine and cheaper than what we originally ordered so ultimately no harm no foul.

We started with the mussels which weren't exceptional.. I ordered the surf and turf for my dinner and the boyfriend ordered the scallops. For the record the boyfriend very much enjoyed his scallops.
 
My experience was a little more lackluster. The waitress never refilled the wine and the water only once during the meal (yes, I know I drink a lot of water). My steak was cooked medium rare when I ordered it medium but it was very well seasoned. The lobster was delicious. The whipped potatoes came out salty, cold and with whole chunks of potato in them. The asparagus was properly cooked with a yummy sauce poured over them.

The same man owns both River Bleu and Bernadin's at Ratcliff in Uptown which is a shame because for about the same price we could have gone to Bernadin's where we have never had a disappointing experience. The atmosphere and meals lacked the polish you would expect from the price and online description of the restaurant. Since we will be close by after the move we will probably try them again, but not for a while."}
{"text":"Not too good. It looks like a fine dining restaurant but it is not. My wife and I went for lunch and it was ok. We should have known better when we seen an $11 Kobe beef burger on the menu. I had the Asian pork bbq tacos which was ok, and my wife had the crab cakes which were small and tasted like they were out of a package. The fries were not that good either. We will not be going back. Staff was nice."}
{"text":"This is one of those cases that I empathize with other yelpers that I cannot give 3 1/2 stars. Three seems a little chintzy for my experience, but it doesn't deserve four either. Went here for lunch today, it is new, open two weeks to the day.

Started with the crab dip. My first and continuing reaction was that it was very salty. Comes with a decent sized loaf of grilled pre-sliced bread. Our bread was a bit burned on each end, so our server brought us a new loaf without us asking. I would say too much filler in the dip, but at least the crab seemed fresh. But God almighty people, lay off the darned salt already!!

I had the shrimp curry as my entree. This is an Indian style curry. Certainly not the best curry I have had, but it was very decent. Served with jasmine rice. Good amount of shrimp in it that were tasty and cooked to perfection. 

Lunch mate had the sriracha mahi tacos. He is an extremely picky eater and never eats anything green. Ever. So he asked for \"no salad stuff\" (slaw) and I suggested he also have the tomato/onion relish put on the side because he always skips onions on whatever he orders. There was a third item on the tacos that again the server showed proactive insight and put that on the side too. His complaint was the avocado slices on each taco were sparse. The amount of fish on each taco (2 of em) looked adequate but not like, \"wow awesome value.\"

The service was excellent from our server, April. That warrants a solid one star right there. The food however was again just \"decent\" save the big miss with the over salted crab dip, which is why the stars just can't quite get to four count."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I was genuinely underwhelmed. We went on a Friday night and was able to get right in (that was a red flag right off the bat). The server was very nice, but completely unversed on the menu. She had to go to the restaurant a couple of times to ask questions that, in our opinion, really should have been easy for her to answer. 

The ambiance was meant to be upscale and modern, but it was just average and dark....and  mean dark in the literal sense. The restaurant was so dark that we had to use the flashlights on our phones to read the menu! The food was a bit pricey and was really just \"ok\". Not really good and not really bad, just \"ok\". 

It's a shame that we didn't love this place. It's in a good location and the menu has promise, but it totally missed the mark for us. With all of the restaurant choices in the area, there is no need for a return visit."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Good food, albeit overpriced, and terrible restaurant management.  This is a consistent theme throughout the reviews I've read. 
This was our third trip to Riverbleu.  We have enjoyed all our meals there.  The food is typically very good.  Tonight was just weird.  We ordered drinks (Wine and Tea) and appetizers.  The appetizers were delicious.  My wife ordered a second glass of wine that she saw sitting on the bar for 10+ minutes while our waiter walked back and forth by our table.  No biggie - he forgot and when I mentioned it to him he scurried it right over.
I ordered shrimp and grits (great!) and she ordered the special, described to us as sea bass, with such and such sides.  When the food was delivered the fish looked like no sea bass that either of us had ever seen or had.  We both tasted it and the fish was good - but it was not sea bass.  We asked the waiter about it, showed him a picture of what sea bass looks like and he said \"let me get my manager\".  
This is where it gets weird.  A young, red headed bearded man cam up to our table, stopped, looked at us and the food, and turned around and left.  My wife says, was that him?  I dunno.  He came back shortly after and said, \"you don't like the fish?\"  My wife said, I like it fine but it's not sea bass.  He said, Oh it's Australian sea bass not Chilean sea bass (both look the same and not like what was on her plate).  My wife was saying something else about the fish and mid sentence he turned and walked away - never to return.  He did stand across the restaurant and watched us until we left.  Just weird and he certainly didn't care if he had satisfied his customers.  Too bad cause the food here is good - including the mystery fish my wife had for dinner.  For a $100 dinner for two you'd hope that the Manager, Bost Roberts, would know how to treat customers better than we were treated tonight."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time. I was excited to try it. We had the baked brie for an app. I found the portion to be small and the items it was served with a little strange. But it was average. Not bad but I've had much better. I ordered the scallops and risotto. As soon as it was placed in front of me I had a few thoughts...small portion for $27, scallops appeared to be undercooked and there appeared to be grease pooling around the risotto. I had a bite of risotto it was undercooked and bland. I ate half a scallop with the same result. I don't review places often and even if I try a place that is so so I always give them another chance. I would call my food inedible and will never go back. Very disappointed. Upon arriving home I was very ill and sick to my stomach. Never again."}
{"text":"Service was very good, the steak was cooked to perfection. Mixed Drinks a bit weak. But overall it was a great experience. Prices I  thought we're reasonable for the quality of food. I'd recommend this restaurant to all my friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a DELICIOUS place! What a nice place for a birthday dinner for my mom (and stepdad & I)! And Thursday's are $5 Martini night too! 

We all shared a Hot Crab Dip with French baguette slices that was delicious and so plentiful with Crab.
- I got Sesame Encrusted Ahi Tuna with coconut rice, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, & carrots. I also had a salad with poached apples, walnuts, bleu cheese crumbles, with red wine vinaigrette. I couldn't recommended this place more!
- Mom got Srirachi Mahi Mahi with ratatouille & grit cakes. She also had a house salad and She Crab Soup. 
-Dad got the \"trio\" which was flat iron steak, crab cake, & shrimp served with mashed potatoes & asparagus. He also also had a house salad.

Big thanks to our servers Brittany & Ana who were incredible, Matthew who made some delicious martinis, & Austin another server who was wonderful and took birthday pics for us! Also, Nick the Sous Chef was incredibly nice and Allison the manager was wonderful. Such a great place - definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast experience at River Bleu Restaurant.  Their Sunday Brunch was Excellent! Pretty much everything you could want for breakfast. Omelets made to order, Belgian Waffels, Smoked Salmon,Country Hash Browns, Fresh Fruit, French Toast. It was all good. I held a small brunch gathering at River Bleu in February and everyone enjoyed the food,service and company. We ll defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"A member of my party didn't like their meal. I wasn't happy with how management handled the situation. Allowed a reorder but charged for both meals."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went on Friday night for our first visit to Riverbleu and we fell in love with it. We started with the buffalo smoked wings for an appetizer and they were some of the best wings we've ever had. We both had a drink (a manhattan for me, strawberry lemonade for her) and those were great as well. For entrees she got the riverbleu trio and I got the goat cheese crusted chicken. Perfection! Matched with a glass of wine, the entrees were amazing. Our server, Brittany, was a great, friendly and attentive server. The next time we go back we'll be asking for her! The ambiance, atmosphere, everything was great. Highly recommend Riverbleu!"}
{"text":"We went yesterday evening and tried the restaurant week menu. Dinner was fantastic and our server was very attentive. The scallops were delicious and the tuna appetizer was great. Also- the white chocolate creme brûlée is amazing! Definitely worth trying!!!"}
{"text":"Matt is awesome!! He's personable and very knowledgeable about the menu-- Matt promptly greeted & seated (smiles) -- I'd recommend eating here for the patio experience along with awesome service & a very seafood geared menu!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. We were greeted as soon as we stepped foot inside. Opted to sit outside. I ordered the basil pesto chicken sandwich. It was good but needed more flavor. I had the sautéed veggies. They were good but entirely too salty. Could not finish them. Priced okay."}
{"text":"I'll drive closer to uptown for a good dinner experience rather than go to this place again. Just terribly disappointed. The GM is in serious need of management training. When the staff claims that \"he's in a bad mood\" and cannot address a guest need, that's a red flag for sure. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"3 adults for lunch. Only one other table in restaurant being served, yet food took quite awhile. 

Meal one - salmon patty was cold, but had good taste, came with under-fried okra (did not bother to even send back.) We did mention it to server. He could barely speak English. He said okay and walked off. 

Meal two - blt was supposed to have no tomato per instructions. It came with tomato and very soggy, fatty bacon  (sent back it was so bad, ordered a Reuben - pretty good, but came when others were done eating)

Meal three - quiche of the day was over cooked (did not bother to send back, just ate middle and ate fruit and salad.)

Manager never came over or anything. When we received our bill there was a 15% discount taken off. ($6.00)

Btw, This is the new restaurant where City Tavern was located previously in Steele Creek. The menu was decent. Nice inside. I hope since they are new that they will improve greatly!"}
{"text":"Here with my wife for a late lunch / early dinner during Restaurant Week. I had booked on OpenTable even though it was still early, so we had no trouble getting a comfortable table without a wait.

I had the seared ahi tuna to start and it was great. A good portion, well presented. Mrs. chose the she crab soup. Very rich with a lot of sherry in there and a strong crab taste despite not having a lot of crab meat chunks, it was thoroughly enjoyed.

Main course, I chose the scallops in a mushroom risotto. Amazing. The scallops were grilled perfectly and tasted excellent. The risotto was the perfect al dente and had a full, rich flavor. Amazing.

Mrs. had the surf and turf. The shrimp were great and the potatoes were great, but the asparagus was overdone and the steak, while cooked to the requested medium rare, was just not that great a cut. It was difficult to cut, likely due to a large tendon through it. Flavor was there, but the texture was off.

Desserts were amazing. White chocolate creme brulee and a cinnamon bun bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. Delish.

Thank you, restaurant week. I likely wouldn't have come here otherwise, but we'll absolutely be back! It's great to have a higher end restaurant in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"Good lunch portions surf and turf cooked perfectly Lamberger more than enough to eat good price. Dinner menu and drinks reasonable. Dinner menu much better than lunch."}
{"text":"I had the grilled salmon with veggies and it was great. Good service and very nice place with outside eating space and upper level deck."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Excellent, fine dining choices. I am giving 4 stars to the food,  chef and atmosphere of the restaurant. We have only been there twice, since moving to this area. However, each time we have gone to dinner the wait staff has been off.  When we pay that price for a delicious dinner, then we expect a nicer level of service and certain etiquette service for fine dining to be followed.  We hope they find more well experienced staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! Daughter and myself were having Girl's Night. The basil lime gimlets were the bomb and my Mahi Mahi was perfection. They had live music and daughter knew him so they sang together!    But the food, go for the food!"}
{"text":"My daughter and myself had gone for lunch on a groupon deal. The food was decent but nothing out of the world. We did try the soul rolls as an appetizer and they were great and flavorful. I had lunch portion flat iron steak with veggies and mashed potatoes. My daughter's kids meal did not come with a drink like most places and paid 4.00 extra for her drink. Our waitress was very nice and pleasant, however with only 2 other tables of people in the restaurant on a Sunday, service was slow. We received the appetizer after our entree and had already started eating. I stopped  another waiter to ask to send my waitress for  a condiment and was going to cancel the appetizer order since it had not arrived. The waitress returned with the appetizer and stated they would be free since it took so long. Once the bill came, she stated that she had to add the appetizer back on the bill since we had to spend $30. This wasn't a big deal since the meal was inexpensive with groupon, however I not quite sure I would return on an average day because of the slow service and average food."}
