{"text":"Silver Inn Restaurant seemed very promising due to it's history and following on Urbanspoon, however I was disappointed after eating here. It was much too Westernized for my taste. There was a fork next to the chopsticks which is fine but... well, you know (I heard forks clinking at the tables around us).  It was all Westernized Chinese food. We ordered the following items:  - Hot & Sour Soup - Salt & Pepper Squid - Ginger Beef - Bean Curd w/ Chinese Mushrooms & Vegetables - White Rice  The Hot & Sour Soup and the Bean Curd dish were the best out of the five items we ordered. The Salt & Pepper Squid and Ginger Beef were nothing special (they were as we expected them to be). The rice was like Uncle Ben's brand rice and quite dry (difficult to eat with chopsticks).  For an authentic \"Peking food\" experience, I'm not confident that I would recommend this place. Ginger Beef restaurant (now moved or gone) in Sunridge Mall did better."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, favorite Chinese place in the city. Must try the sweet and sour pork and beef and broccoli.  My GF and I don't feel the weekend is complete without it. :)"}
{"text":"I happened to be in calgary. I was looking for food that represents the city. It is relatively a young city with a diverse culture. One thing I came across was ginger beef. Calgary was the spring board and kwon and the silver inn is the center of all. So how could I pass up the opportunity to sink my teeth into their food? I started with a hot sour soup with extra green onions and hot oil. It was not epic but not bad either. It is a decent hot and sour soup with no regrets. Now the ginger beef, is it all that it is cracked up to beef. Will it be another heavy sweet sauced dish?? Well drum roll......it is delicious dish. Yes fried so caloric indeed. But hey put those calorie counters away and dig into these crunchy bits of heaven. Why live for tomorrow while all these wonders passes you by. The sauce is tangy mixed with some heat. You will find yourself mixing the meat in the sauce to soak up as much goodness as possible. I hope this helps and I hope you try it. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Heaven. Glutenfree goodness. We devoured the salt & pepper seafood, the Szechuan shredded beef is just perfect - we almost ordered another so we would have extras to bring home!   Crisp, crunchy with just the perfect amount of spice.   Every dish I've ordered here has been a hit with family and guests.   Sizzling rice is one of my favourite dishes and it's not commonly available.  It's almost an extra saucy crispy rice dish bordering on soup. I crave that dish.   If you have extras, definitely take them home - they reheat beautifully.   It's a pilgrimage every visit to Calgary we detour to get our fill.  Looking forward to my next visit...soon."}
{"text":"Calgary is known for their ginger beef and I definitely was not disappointed . It was crisp and the inside was still tender. We had crab and corn soup . And even though they used imitation crab the flavour was still really good. We also ordered the shrimp fried rice. In Vancouver when we order this it usually isn't doused in soy sauce but I didn't mind it. It went well with the ginger beef. We also ordered deep fried chicken wings which my son polished . My only remark is that in Vancouver we are spoiled with excellent Chinese food for great value. This place was a little on the expensive side. Also, the interior was a little old and ghetto looking. For four dishes it was $65 . Considering the place did look ghetto I was surprised with the price point but maybe that's just the going rate in Calgary. I don't normally judge a book by its cover so it still gets 4 stars. The service wasn't super friendly . Just typical Chinese restaurant service with grumpy looking waitresses but they were efficient. Would I come back? Sure. Just a heads up, if ur looking for crispy noodle chow mein, they don't serve it here."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Asian food restaurant I have been to. The ginger beef is amazing (apparently they invented it). All the food was awesome and very fresh.   The prices were very reasonable and portions large.   It's kind of a mom and pop place but the service is great."}
{"text":"When I was little, I was convinced that certain items were staples of authentic Chinese cuisine. These things are pretty obviously westernized to my adult mind, but how was I to know that ginger beef wasn't available to the rest of the world at large? It was only during an extended stay in Europe that I discovered that Ginger Beef is not only a Canadian invention, it was first made right here at the Silver Inn in the 70s. I still think it is a tragedy that you can't get it around the world.   I love the Ginger Beef here - sweet, crispy and pungent with garlic. It does not taste like candy which some variations do, and has a slight salty bent. As the first to make it, they definitely have the edge.   The other food is also delicious, but my mind can't be swayed off that delicious Ginger Beef.  The Silver Inn is located on Centre Street in the north end of Calgary, and is not very close to any other restaurants. It is inexpensive and delicious, and the entrance is decorated with adorable childrens' pictures. A visit here always feels a little bit like a visit to family. Considering their very established nature, that is not entirely untrue!"}
{"text":"Eating here felt like I would be cheating on a girlfriend. I have a heavy allegiance to northwest Calgary's Peking Garden - it's been the only Chinese food place I'd dare to eat at for well over 10 years now. If ever there was a monogamous relationship with a restaurant, PG and I were in it.   But, my roommate's mom was having her birthday here and because I bring a special kind of pizazz to every party I'm invited to (read: Invite me to your parties, I'm super rad), I was brought along for the ride. I wore baggy clothes and considered a wig, lest anyone from Peking Garden should happen to be walking by when I entered. In the end, I opted out on the wig. I'd make a terrible woman.  We ordered Ginger beef, lemon chicken, salt and pepper squid/scallops/shrimp/seafood, sweet and sour pork, a noodle dish and the sizzling rice. We probably got a few more things, but those are the only ones I can recall as I allowed the party hosts to order up the food while trying desperately to avoid calling up Peking Garden and confess everything. The guilt was tangible.  The Silver Inn is pretty big, decor is pretty simple and prices are pretty affordable. Unlike other reviewers, I have no clue what \"Authentic\" Peking food even is, so I'm fine to shuck up to some westernized Asian food and down it like there's an oncoming famine. No complaints on authenticity here, all it needs to be is edible.  How did it stack up?  As much as I hate to admit it, this place DOES have the better Ginger Beef. It's sweet, saucy, powerful and crispy. Every bite of that adulterous dish made me feel alive in ways I hadn't felt in a long time. It was magic, discovery... it was so wrong that it was right. I was left licking the sauce of my own infidelities from my fingertips, simultaneously emboldened and ashamed. Whether they invented it or not, it's really good.  The salt and pepper squid was also delicious; a good portion and not too salty. It wrapped me in its warm, tentacle embrace, and for a few moments I thought to myself, \"Peking Who?\"  That said, the sizzling rice was a bit underwhelming. I'm used to bountiful portions, lots of toppings and a sauce that you would crawl over glass to lick out of a bowl. The noodle dish we had was big and delicious (but nothing special) and the lemon chicken was a plus as well - perfectly deep fried and soft in the center where it counts.   Fortune cookies were also delivered, I think mine had something to do with smiling in the face of opportunity or something.  At the end of the day, I won't be leaving the ol' PG too soon. Everything there is a home run. I'll stay as true as I can, but I hope you won't fault me for ordering a discretely delivered plate or two of Ginger Beef from the Silver Inn."}
{"text":"Claims to be authentic \"Peking\" food.  If you're into westernized chinese food then this place might be appealing to you but if you're looking for authentic Beijing cuisine then this isn't the place.  There's pretty much nothing on the menu that you'd find in a Beijing restaurant besides Peking duck.  We tried the ginger beef because this place was supposedly the creator of the dish (40 years ago).  It was was hard to find the meat under all the bread.  We got some white rice and it was cooked horribly and completely dried out.  The food was no better than mall Chinese food.  There were only two of us so we skipped on the duck but out of the dishes we did try nothing really impressed us."}
{"text":"Good dumplings. Good mushoo. Good black bean mixed vegetables. Good Shanghai Noodles with beef. Good palace chicken. Decent salt n pepper squid good bar b q pork fried rice. Great ginger beef. Fantastic candy apples/pineapples. Overall: good-great North American Chinese food. Classic ginger beef; not too saucy, tender beef and crunchy batter."}
