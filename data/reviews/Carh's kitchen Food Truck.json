{"text":"Had the Gyro Greek chicken wrap and the beef empanadas. Both were very fresh and the tzatziki sauce on the wrap was spot on. The sauce with the empanadas really added to their taste as well. Had to wait a bit for the food,  but it was worth it. Ocotillo Chandler Friday food truck get together was relaxing to go to. Hope Carh's Kitchen continues to be at this event."}
{"text":"O my goodness Carh Kitchen is da best. All the food that is made from them has alot of loving in them. If you are in the area when they are at an event this is a must. Spend some time and have a bite to eat they are affordable. Dave Sr is the Chef and the lady with him is Pat. This is a family business. So I hope to see everyone there. Mahalo"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food Truck! We host Carh's Kitchen along with live music at The Windmill Winery for our Food Truck Thursdays and I must say they are easy going and always such a pleasure to work with. Our customers always rave about the quality of the food. Everything is fresh and prepared the day of and it certainly shows. I personally love the cubano and never pack a lunch when I know they are coming!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this food truck earlier this evening. Hands down, the best food I've ever gotten from a truck and much better than food you usually get at sit down restaurants. The Colombian empanadas were spectacular! Wonderful flavors, fresh, and not greasy at all. If Carh's kitchen is at the same location next Friday, I'll be there. I'm so impressed!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!! I had a Cubano sandwich, Greek fries and Tzatziki at Carh's Food Truck at the Chandler Art Walk held at Tech Shop last night.  Wow! The food was amazing. I have travelled the world and this food is at the top of my list.  I will definitely follow Carh's Food Truck location."}
{"text":"When you see that purple food truck, stop and grab some awesome gyros. They call it the Queens gyro. The price is reasonable compared to other food trucks and definitely worth the cost. Made with fresh ingredients and an explosive taste, I would definitely recommend them! With Dave manning the cooking and his wife Pat taking orders, they are friendly and they do make you feel at home, even standing on the sidewalk waiting for food."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Truck came to office in N Scottsdale.  Had Queens Gyro.  Great flavor and just the right size for a filling lunch along with side of greek fries.  Most of the menu looked good, was hard to decide.  Quick turnaround and reasonable prices.  Friendly owner operator as well. Will definitely hit this truck again if around."}
{"text":"Carh's Kitchen Food Truck came to my office complex last week and I was stoked to try it. It DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I got the chicken gyro and honestly...it was the best chicken gyro I have ever had. TheTzatziki sauce had great flavor, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the pita bread was soft and delicious. Their fries were even good which I have found is very hard to accomplish with the food trucks that come here. I highly record this truck if you are ever by it and I HOPE they come back to Scottsdale Airpark in the near future!"}
{"text":"Very good food, service was orderly and courteous. More food trucks should be like this!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fingers... my expectations were not high to begin with because I don't think of chicken fingers as being a gourmet meal. The breading was okay,but the spices made it feel like an attempted chicken parm, which was weird. They served it with some kind of creamy dipping sauce, which I avoided because I dislike ranch and anything remotely like it. I opted for ketchup instead. But the chicken itself was rubbery and stale tasting - like it had freezer burn and was taken from the freezer to the fryer without defrosting it first. I thought I'd be safe ordering the one thing that is impossible to do badly, but I chose poorly. The fries were mediocre at best; soggy and plain. Not even the ketchup could save them. If I try them again, it will not be for either of those items. But at least the people were friendly and nice to talk to."}
{"text":"We were EXTREMELY impressed with Carh's Food Truck.  We do an end of the month lunch for our employees so we decided to switch it up in October and get a food truck.  Every employee had something wonderful to say - the food was amazing and the service was just as great. They are super enthusiastic about their food and they should be - it was unique and tasty!  We will definitely be inviting them again.  

I ordered the chicken gyro and fries...everything was made right at that time so it is fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Caught up with the Cahrs food truck at the Saturday open air market. The pork empanadas were good, outsides crispy not greasy. But the most amazing was the side relish/salsa of tomatoes and green onion. Compliments the pork perfectly!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Such a great cubano sandwich!! they fed our entire office!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service always hard to find but received this today. Fresh food! french fries and burger were great. Also huge servings!"}
{"text":"A few different food trucks visit my work on a weekly basis currently. I looked up Carh's Kitchen on Yelp and decided to give them a try. I have a confession. This was the first time I have ever ordered from a food truck (I live under a rock). The woman who greeted me was very friendly and helpful. I had a lot of questions like always and she did not mind spending the time to assist me. I ordered two Brooklyn Burgers and two orders of fries for a co-worker and I. I paid with my debit card and the wait for fresh food was about five minutes.

The burger was decently sized and cooked just how I enjoy. I shared half of my meal with another co-worker and she said the burger and fries were very good as well. I really enjoyed the fries too. They seem to have care about the quality of food they deliver to their customers and I highly appreciate that.

Overall, a tasty meal, friendly prompt service, and fresh ingredients. I have no complaints and I do intend to order lunch from them more often."}
{"text":"Great home style Colombian cooking...even weirder try the Brooklyn Burger...seriously to die for! Tried this food truck for the first time in Downtown Gilbert's Food Truck Friday's and have been hooked since. Don't be shy and give them a try, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both were excellent. 

Chili cheese fries - amazing. Fresh cut fries (there should not be any other kind. EVER), flavorful chili, real cheese and fresh jalape√±os. Spicy and satisfying. 

Beef empanadas - I loved these. The outside was cooked just right and the filling was tasty and moist. Not greasy at all. It came with pico that seemed like it was made fresh today, and it was also very good with great flavor. 

One of my favorite food trucks for sure."}
