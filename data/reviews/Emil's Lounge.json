{"text":"This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (\"Norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  

The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  

The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.

Overall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.

Also, the food is really good. :)"}
{"text":"The fish sandwich is great. I know the cook personally and he is a good cook. I have not had the pleasure of dining in the restaurant but, look forward to doing so in the near future."}
{"text":"My mother and I each had the Delmonico style steak with shrimp and my wife ordered the fish. We all had the battered french fries. All of the food was delicious and the service was great. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"We heard about this place on Andrew Zimmer Delicious Destinations on TV. The place was nice and very clean.they greet you as you walk in. Patrons who had been there before were boasting about the great food. We sat at the bar , and there is also a family dining area.A fellow next to me loves the  Reuben and said it's huge! That the lobster is as good as up in Maine where he has worked and the steaks are juicy and tender. We were there for the fish and knowing the orders were big I ordered a junior size. My hub ordered regular size ,well it was huge, 3 lge planks about a lb of fish. It was very good. I introduced myself to the owner she has taken over since her dad passed away. She said it's a neighborhood place where everyone knows each other and safe area. It's a family place. no late hangers at the bar because she closes very early. But now during lent people come for the fish so she stays open late, like 8 or 9pm.Great fish We will go back."}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays."}
{"text":"Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback
ack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty."}
{"text":"Emil's is a great place to eat! The prices are VERY reasonable, the portions are HUGE and everything I have ever ordered has been tasty and well prepared. The people who work there are so friendly, as are the customers who eat there. Ample free parking makes it easy to go there. I didn't worry about the area- the police station is right across the street. Don't leave the Burgh without having (1) their fish sandwich, and (2) their Reuben. You will be glad you ate there!"}
{"text":"Has the best fish sandwich and shrimp alfredo! The fish was perfectly breaded and fried, topped with homemade tartar sauce on an oversized delicious bun. I have been searching for the elusive perfect alfredo sauce and finally found it. Omg, I'm not exaggerating! Creamy rich goodness delighted my finally satiated taste buds. Add precisely cooked fettuccine and shrimp and you have a winner! This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"All previous reviews are correct! We went to Emil's for my sons 18th Birthday lunch. My son is a Rueben connoisseur of sorts. He's tried Ruebens in many cities around the country including NYC. He agreed... excellent! We tried all the favorites. Stuffed cabbage- delicious! Fish sandwich- yummy and gigantic. Delicious, enormous cheeseburger and both the fries and onion rings were great too. As for the staff, our waitress went above and beyond. She was very friendly and even though we were there on Saturday, she managed to rustle up some halushka for me... it's a Friday only dish. We came from out of town and I was REALLY looking forward to having one of my childhood favorites. I really appreciated the extra effort and it was yummy. We all left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"I remember the old man 20 years ago eating a giant size hamburger used asked me questions I miss those days food there is spectacular the fish is to die at four if you never been there just put it on your schedule of your things to do and I promise you you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My Previous visit to Emil's was good.  Tonight's was disastrous.   Arrived before 5 but waited for others   Only two tables in main room occupied.    We ordered at 5:15 and other tables started to fill up.  Their orders were placed after ours.   One by one they were getting their food.  5:50 we ask about our food, with the reply Baked takes 20-25 minutes longer.   This was 40 minutes after our placed order.   We never were informed about extra time needed.   The bartender tried with her heart to make it better.   More food orders kept coming out to All the tables around us much to her surprise!!    Finally at 6:10 our food arrived.  The bartender advised us more than once the Owner was on her way to see us.   I only ate 1/2 my meal being so upset.   We received our check with just 2 maybe 3 beers being comped!!   We left to our event and my daughter said the Owner came out but not to our table.   Not even an apology from the Owner and our bill was $66 plus tip without the beer.   Our waitress was not attentive.  Our family night out was a bust!    My thanks to the bartender (shorter black hair) your kindness was appreciated."}
{"text":"good people. good food. it's the essence of pittsburgh in one of it's many borough(s). what more can you ask for? go steelers!"}
{"text":"Emil's was featured on 25 things I love about Pittsburgh last year and have been meaning to come through and check it out. One year later I finally made it and boy was I glad!!

The surrounding area is a little sketch... but once you arrive at Emil's all your worries melt away. My husband and I were greeted with a friendly hello and welcoming service. The owner is so friendly and down to earth and so are the other staff.  It felt like we were visiting friends.

Anyway, the food. OMG the food is pure comfort!! I had the fried fish sandwich. It was seriously 1 pound! Perfectly fried and nestled in a warm soft flaky bun, actually, it's more like half a loaf of bread. The burgers are juicy and scrumptous. Soup of the day was cream of mushroom soup. Have you ever had homemade c.o.m.s.? I am not talking about the gelatinous stuff out of the can! Ya'll this soup was the bomb diggity! I've also had their wedding soup and it was super delicious!! The featured beer on tap was pumpkin beer. (I don't think it was a feature, or at least it wasn't presented that way. But for me it was their featured beer) It honestly tasted like Thanksgiving in a cup, it was great! Oh and I really like the root beer on tap too. Lastly, they have different specials throughout the week.

I can't wait to come back. Next I want to try the Ruben sammies! For me, I believe Emil's Lounge is as close to southern comfort food (if not better) I can get here in Pittsburgh. I absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911."}
{"text":"Old school.....traditional \"mom 'n pop\" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it."}
{"text":"This place was very good. I found out about Emil's when watching a show called \"25 Things I Love About Pittsburgh\" on WQED hosted by Rick Seback. This place ain't a luxurious restaurant...it's a beer & a shot bar / lounge. But the people are friendly & the food is good. I had the fish sandwich which was great. It ain't in a great part of town, Rankin, but I've been in worse places!! Try this place."}
{"text":"My mom and I could have shared a Reuben sandwich. It was huge. It was delicious and affordable but its certainly a two part meal or perfect to share. The bar could use updated but its not in disrepair just a bit old school. The restaurant is close to the Rankin Police so they frequently come through. Parking is plentiful and seating is too. They have a full service bar so you can have a drink with lunch or dinner. They close at 7 so ordering take out is probably in my near future. The staff is friendly and made us feel welcomed. I have to force myself to try other menu items because that sandwich was a winner for me."}
{"text":"Chicken Romano (yes, again - it's that good). My husband had the Shrimp stuffed with crab - wow! Love, love! Thanks KK, great suggestions!"}
{"text":"Love my hometown favorites. Cannot beat their fish sandwiches (although I do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced bread...stop that). Always will support Emil's
Other favorites include Reuben, Hawkins Avenue sandwich, Chrissy Club."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!"}
{"text":"safe being it's across from the police station. Clean bathrooms! Great fish sandwich; but AWESOME Reuben! No way you can find better."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. The restaurant we wanted to try in the area doesn't open for lunch and I found Emil's on Yelp. The portion sizes were huge, the prices were good, and the service was wonderful. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy 
Is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I'm in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the trip"}
{"text":"Great food  & service every visit. They do so many things right there especially taking care of the customers.  I have always received a hello, a follow up on my food, a thank you and then a good bye.  Some many restaurants get away from these simple steps of service. I'm glad Emil's has not."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh and it's not even debatable. I had the pleasure of speaking with Emil's grandson who is a bright and industrious young man. I hope this place stays open forever."}
{"text":"Long story short...chicken parm Thursday, fish on Fridays. Chrissy club any other day. Huge grilled chicken or steak salads. And a burger you can eat for lunch and save half for dinner. Great comfort food on the menu as well. 

I come here during my lunch break and need a nap when I get back to work cause the portions are so big. Very hospitable staff and relaxing atmosphere. You should see this place during lent. Line is out the door. 

If you live in West Mifflin, Duquesne, Whitaker, Munhall, Homestead and haven't eaten here you're missing out. Rankin, Braddock, Swissvale you already know."}
{"text":"Best Reuben sandwich ever!!!!!  I've tried many times to find something comparable but nothing comes close. Great food and friendly atmosphere. Definitely a favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years - they even catered my wedding.  But it wasn't until today that I tried the cabbage rolls.  Saw them featured on the Food Channel (or it could've been the Travel Channel) and they showed how they made the rolls.  It was cool that I knew the person they interviewed - Tara.  Anyway, I ordered them today and they lived up to the hype.  They were great!!!  My husband's fish sandwich was great too - enormous and delicious every time."}
{"text":"I wouldnt say the best fish sandwich ive ever had...definitely a huge portion but rather bland and nothing special. Very nice people and good service but i would largely disagree with most of the reviews here. Atmosphere was quite drab, classic western pa corner bar but no windows, poorly lit, and overall fairly dismal.... Clientele seemed to be on deaths door, missing limbs and morbidly obese. Fries were frozen and under cooked. Meatballs were dry and bland as well. I had high hopes but left feeling disappointed, defeated, bloated and like i had swallowed the entire rustbelt in one bite..."}
{"text":"We finally got here on the third try. 

Everything we heard about the fish was true, fantastic and thick with perfect batter. 

Fries, onion rings and cole slaw are the perfect companions and the bun is soft and fresh.

The catfish is very good also very good, give the cajun a try."}
{"text":"Another divey place we have been going to for years. My dad's favorite, as he knows the original owners. Certain items on the menu are named after the kids. Huge portions, might have a bit of a wait some nights. Huge burgers, fish sandwiches, salads. Decent service."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time but my first review. It never disappoints! Always home cooking, old school like grandma's house. Don't expect ambiance, but if you're hungry and want nice wait staff, (usually family) squeaky clean, great value and generous portions-way more than I can ever finish, Emil's is your place.

Tonight I had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that was sooooo good! Very obviously home made. I had a side of onion rings that were perfectly cooked, which doesn't sound fancy, but I still couldn't finish. My husband had the chicken parm. Thursday is Italian night. It came with a huge salad, very fresh, an entire loaf of Italian bread, and a generous portion of nicely crisped and tender chicken breasts. Added to that, a side helping of ziti. My husband enjoyed it very much, the chicken was perfectly cooked. I'm a sauce snob, Italian, allergic to with an aversion to green peppers. To me, there was just a hint of green pepper in the sauce so I probably would avoid anything with red sauce at Emil's but that's just my quirk. I've had the stuffed cabbages there, the fried fish, Ruebens, burgers - all wonderful! Emil was and his family is of Serbian decent. Food is love. We love Emils!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite neighborhood bar restaurant; it's my favorite restaurant period, and the perfect example of comfort food. Situated in Rankin beside the police station, don't be put off by the outside appearance. The inside is smallish but comfortable and the rest rooms are clean. A review of the fish sandwich brought me in the first time. It's as good as Nieds on Butler St. but 30-40% larger, crisp outer crust and flaky inside. Be careful during Lent, there can be lines. My other go to meals include the Chicken Parm (Thurs. only), Chopped Sirloin Steak, Stuffed Cabbage, Rueben Sandwich, and the burgers; all are tops. I haven't tried the other sandwiches but they sure look great. The soups stand out as well. Portions can be on the large side and for me meals are priced on the low end.

The staff is very friendly and efficient; Tara usually is my server, and with Krissy, the second generation owner, they make the whole experience even better."}
{"text":"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."}
{"text":"From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Stuffed Cabbage w/ lots of subtly flavored meat & a large side of homemade mashed potatoes, so satisfyingly good!  5 stars! If I could eat it once a week, I would be happy. We should have ordered some to take home. If it was closer to CMU, the students would be there everyday for the stuffed cabbage. 

Waitstaff: 5 stars- super warm & friendly, real family and neighborhood feel.

Italian food is only on Thursdays! 
Meatball hoagie: 2 big meatballs, in big hoagie bread, good sauce, only $5.99! Same for the Sausage Hoagie. 

Fish Sandwich- super big & crispy. The table next to us had the Reuben sandwich on big slices of rye bread. Only the cup of soup was tiny, maybe it was included, not sure? 

We visited bc we saw this place on Andrew Zimmern's travel channel show. It's a little out of the way, but we used google maps. Can of Soda was only $1.00. The bathrooms are sparkling new. 

The interior & exterior of the restaurant doesn't reflect the good experience we had (normally I wouldn't go in, but hubby is adventurous & loves to support local businesses). We went after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to have amazing food and my experience with the catering has been good but the last 2 times I've ate there I've been extremely disappointed. Last time I got the steak which was flavorless and extremely tough. The prices are high as well. I would not go back here."}
{"text":"Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh."}
