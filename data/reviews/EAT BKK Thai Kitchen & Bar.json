Beef Salad does not really look like a salad. Perhaps  it's the cultural difference, it looks like stir fried beef with some coriander to me and yet it's a bit spicy. A bit more mint will be great.

Baby Octopus is crispy and it tastes especially good with their sauce.

Green Curry tastes sooooo delicious with the white rice. The green curry is creamy and spicy with slightly sweet. I love this dish so much.

Soft Shell Crab with Thai fried rice. Soft shell crabs are deep fried but it tastes a bit tasteless to me. I would prefer to eat with the sweet and sour sauce. 

Islamic Noodle is tasty with the sauce. The sauce taste sweet and added flavour to the noodle. There's beef in the noodle as well. This dish is filling.

Fried Chicken with Rice Noodle. The rice noodle is extremely spicy. It really wakes me up.

This is a good and exciting adventure!!!"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.0/5.0

Was excited to hear that one of my favourite Thai spots have opened up a second location at Yonge and Steeles which is a bit more convenient for me.

We ordered a few items and unfortunately it was not as good as the original location. 

Deep Fried Baby Octopus (3.0/5.0) $8.45 - Nothing too special about this dish. Would have liked the Tom Yum flavour to come out more and perhaps fried at a bit higher heat. Although it was intended to be a fried dish, it was a bit oilier than expected.


Pad Kee Mao (2.5/5.0) $14.45 - My usual go to item at the original location but this was the worst dish out of the three that we ordered. Noodles were substantially over cooked and the chicken could have been a bit more tender. 

Garlic and Black Pepper Soft Shell Crab w/ Rice (3.5/5.0) $20.95 - There were about 3 crabs included which is a good amount that matches up with the pricing. This is the dish to try if you are not big on spice as this is more of a savoury dish with a slight sweetness. Would have liked the crab to be less saucy as it lost some of its crispiness. 

Service was very nice and they took my feedback about the noodles with appreciation. Hoping they will improve their food overtime."}
{"text":"Visited their new location near Yonge and Steeles on a weekday night and it is quite spacious with plenty of seating. 

Very nice d√©cor inside with a colourful graffiti wall on one side and a grey container warehouse style wall on the other side. There is also plenty of parking across the street by Centerpoint Mall.

They have a few dishes that are made for sharing between 2-3 people such as the Chicken Pad Thai and Mixed Seafood Bucket. The food came in a decent portion size and was quite flavourful.

Overall it is a nice place to catch up with friends while trying authentic Thai food uptown."}
{"text":"This location has a more cool vibe with lights more dimmed and hits playing. 

Parking at the mall right across. Don't need to j walk, just cross at the light! 

To start off, this is by the same owners over at Finch, with the same chefs too! The menu is a bit different!!! Do keep in mind that they still have a bit to figure out, as it is a different kitchen. 

Fried Morning Glory: portion was smaller than the other location but still tasted as good as the first time!

Fried Taro and Tofu: tasted as it should - nothing too special though

Krungthep Fried Chicken (4pcs): tasted like reg fried chicken! nothing too special either - we got four pieces, three big and one skinny drumstick.

Kaproa Crispy Pork: Very authentic, exactly like Thailand's street food. The crispy pork should not be compared with BBQ Pork, however it is worth a try as it is very different. The skin is very crispy, while the fat is very chewy. Red peppers were spicy!

Tom Yum Hot Pot: Very salty and creamy. We had to ask for hot water to be added. We let them know, so they should be fixing the ingredient potions. Lots of seafood in the mix: mussels, cuttlefish, shrimp! The noodles were like the Mama instant noodles. 

Thai Ice Tea: still a hit! 

I think we're going to go back to the Finch location before the food gets fully figured out at this location!"}
{"text":"We visited this place today around 13:10, 11 May 2018  and it was empty.  I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken and my husband ordered the Green Curry Chicken.  Both included Hot and Sour Soup and 2 Spring Rolls each.   The soup was delicious and both the chicken dishes were plentiful and tasty.  These were part of the lunch special for $10.99 each so it is a bit pricey.   While we were there, a few others came in but they all had ordered take out while one patron did sit down for a meal.  The lady that served us was very pleasant and cheerful."}
{"text":"came here for a birthday celebration.

Beef Salad
It looks like pan fried beef that orientals usually cook to eat with rice. It will be better to have more mint and greens. I could hardly picture this is a salad at all.

Baby Octopus 
They are crispy and taste good with the sauce.

Green Curry with Chicken 
Spicy and yet creamy and delicious. There are lots of chicken in the curry. This dish also comes with a plate of white rice.

Islamic Noodle
I thought this dish will be spicy because of the red colour. 
It actually tastes sweet. There are beef with the noodle as well. Very filling.

Crab Fried Rice
Soft shell crabs are nice deep fried but it seems a bit tasteless to me. There is Thai fried rice underneath the soft shell crab. 

Pad Thai Chicken 
Fried chicken taste good and crispy but the rice noodle is extremely spicy. It comes in a large platter with fried and shrimp chips on the side.

It is such an amazing experience."}
{"text":"So much space here!!
No wait time either but I'm sure that will change when word gets out that this location is now open!
And as always great tasting food!!!
Yes!!!
Started with Fritto Misto and Morning Glory Fried.These appetizers were very tasty!
New pad thai \"Share\" is easily enough food for 3 hungry people!!!
The decor is amazing with vintage posters located near the bar \"storefront\" gives you a glimpse of bkk and a graffiti mural along the length of the restaurant wall brightens up a semi industrial feel (under the bridge with corrugated tin and exposed I-beams)
A great look a great location and of course GREAT FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing A+ love the Atmosphere very hippie! Thai ice tea was very delicious and spring rolls were crispy and yummy. For food we ordered chicken pad Thai and pad kee mew , the pad kee mew was really spicy I had to mix it with pad Thai to balance it, pad Thai was good but not the best! Overall I loved eating here everyone's so nice and food comes out fast and looks really cool"}
{"text":"This is a new Thai place that seemed just to have opened up recently near Yonge and Steeles. I parked inside Centrepoint Mall and walked across (convenient enough that the place is pretty much right at the traffic light so you don't have to walk too far).

Starter: 

Chicken Chips:
Went really well with beer, actually! I know this is fatty but it's great if you have people to share this with.

Khao Soi Poutine:
This is the same as the Sheppard branch so I'm not going to go into detail for this one. Pretty much Poutine with Khao Soi stuffs (pickled onions, yellow curry, etc).

Seafood Salad:
Man, this one is a homer! I love seafood and this certainly does not disappoint! Such a dish that you always have if you go to Thailand. Trust me, try this one.

Main:

My friend ordered Pad Thai with chicken while I ordered Chicken Seed since I did not see this dish at the Sheppard location. It's very interesting! It reminds me of the dish that I liked when I was in Thailand. I haven't seen anything like this one until I got to this location.

Alcohol:
I ordered a Singha beer (seems to be the only beer they have right now, but they assured me that they are sorting out the beer problem) and my friend ordered A Coco Mango. I tried a sip and it's pretty interesting. A little sweet and sour that's just right. Very nice indeed.

Bottomline:
Very cool place to come and chill. Very nice decor - graffiti is really great and, if you don't like too much colour then you can also sit on the other side (zinc roof). I think it would be even better if you come with a few friends as they have some dishes for sharing as well. Great place if you like meat. Many many options!

Tl;dr - try it first. The decor alone is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good food and nice enviroment!

Lots of of parking around the residential area plus after your meal - Centerpoint Mall is just across the street to check out! 

The layout of the restaurant is nice and comfortable - especially seated right next to the open patio - best of both worlds - indoor ambiance and just close enough to outdoor patio :) 

We started the meal with Fritto Misto ($8.45) which features lightly fried baby octopus with Tom Yum marinated fried veggies. The flavour was aromatic and delicious. Crispy and good amount of seasoning. The fried veggies underneath the baby octopus had a slight tart and citrus flavour.

The Chicken Zeed ($12.95) was definitely a kicker. It was super bold and took the taste buds by surprise. It was super spicy for me - be careful and come prepared with a full cup of nice cold water.

The Kaprao Kai Dow Chicken ($13.95) had ground chicken, green and red chilies (including the seeds), fried egg and green beans. Recommend this dish - the seasoning, sauce, the spiciness from the chili on the rice was so good. The egg yolk helped calm down the spiciness lingering on the tongue. The basil and green beans gave it a freshness on otherwise rich and meaty pieces of chicken. There was ALOT of green and red chilies, all slice and mixed into the rice - even after requesting the dish to be mild. The heat was still packed in the dish but, more like a pleasant and welcoming sizzle.

Thai Iced Tea ($4.25) - AMAZING! Creamy, rich, perfectly sweetened - makes for a wonderful refreshing beverage.

First experience dining here - dealing with a 20 people table - I felt they were friendly, responsive and came by our table frequently enough to check on us or at least they were close enough to request for their attention easily."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Best Thai food in Toronto! The panang curry is a must! I love the art on the wall it just adds to the vibe and the taste!"}
{"text":"I won a $50 gift card to the newest Eat BKK location by Yonge and Steeles. I decided to take a friend with me so we could have a feast. Honestly, $50 covers A LOT of food. If I knew how much food we would have ended up with, I would have 100% invited another friend or two. (Funny enough, my cousin won a $50 gift card as well and I went with her for lunch with two other co-workers; it fed the four of us perfectly). The new restaurant is very spacious and was made to accommodate fans of the original location at Yonge and Sheppard (which is a lot smaller). 

I thought the Khao Soi Poutine was unique, with a lot of meat thrown on top of fries. It was a fun appetizer that was great for at least three people since the beef was filling. The Pad Kaprao Crispy Pork I ordered was not the greatest, only because the rice was a bit cold and not as soft. My friend said he quite liked their Pad Thai Chicken. We both ordered Thai Iced Tea and I decided to get the rum-spiked version called the TTT (Tipsy Thai Tea). It was still similar to the original Thai Iced Tea minus the rum. Great if you are a fan of boozy fun drinks, otherwise the regular Thai Iced Tea is just as good. Honestly the amount of food we got was way too much for two people. Eat BKK is super affordable and you can get so much for so many people at little cost. 

You should come here for lunch if you are in the area. For only $10.95, you get a substantial plate of food along with spring rolls and soup (this is the same for the Yonge and Sheppard location). It makes for a super hearty lunch and you get the most bang for your buck! 

I definitely recommend checking out Eat BKK. I was told that both restaurants have slightly different menus. A couple of items at the Yonge and Sheppard location are not on the Yonge and Steeles menu, and vice versa."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in Toronto. It's run by Thai people and the food is amazing here. They have two locations on Yonge and I've been to both - their menus are slightly different but they have the standard dishes there.

We ordered the Thai Milk Tea, Chicken Pas Thai, Crispy Pork Rice and Papaya salad. Their dishes are quite spicy but to me it was perfect - especially the papaya salad. Their pad Thai is hands down my favourite and you MUST get their Thai milk tea!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I love the location and set up of the second location of EAT BKK. 

So much more spacious and the decor just wicked compares to their first location.

We shared my favourite Morning Glory Salad which is as good as I remembered and probably the best item I had for my visit.

Lunch Special Fried Chicken was just a sad piece of processed chicken patty which I would avoid.

Will I be back? Maybe to try out one of those shareable family style options which is new on their menu."}
