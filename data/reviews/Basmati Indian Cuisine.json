{"text":"When I think of subpar service and waiting in line for a table for absolutely no reason, I think Basmati. It's rarely crowded and yet, you end up waiting for a table EVERY time. The staff means no harm - they are have a sweet disposition - just more on the easy going side and have no ability to move quickly.    The complaint is the temperature of the food. Nothing I have ever ordered has been sizzling. Perhaps because the food waits on the kitchen counter before it is picked up and delivered to the table. The food itself is just OK... nothing has a distinctive aroma.  I say, go for the buffet on Thursdays or Sundays. Buffets are exactly that subpar to average quality food at an inexpensive price.   Tip! Check in the back of the Yellow Book for a 50% off your entree coupon when you purchase one entree at full price."}
{"text":"Most dishes are Indian, but they serve food I would categorize as middle eastern as well - hummus and others.  I enjoy a good biryani, and they've got it here.  Several dishes are vegetarian, but meat dishes are prevalent.  The saffron rice is sooo good.  The food is all pretty good, so the buffet might be the best way to go.  The service is decent but sometimes pretty slow."}
{"text":"It is an actual restaurant so it's more comfortable to have a large group of people.. but the food is blegh.. and the service is even worse.  You may be waiting for a while to get a table because they are just kind of slow.  The waiters are SOOOO pushy.  It's probably because they don't get enough service and so they always are suggesting you to order more food or drinks.  The food is never very hot and it's kind of pricey in my opinion.  They also don't make their own sauces.. which is kind of dissapointing since I am sure they have the time to do so.  Oh.. and they don't serve South Indian food which is completely delicious and highly recommended to do if you ever get a chance.  I do give it 2 stars instead of 1 because their buffet is decent.  It's only two nights per week.. but it's enough to fill you up for a reasonable meal."}
{"text":"I'm not the hugest fan of Indian food but if I had to eat it this is where I would go. They also have a few other dishes besides Indian which is nice. The food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic!  A lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd."}
