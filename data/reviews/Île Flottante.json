{"text":"I love this place a lot. It had high end food but the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. Service is always excellent. The dishes are unique and always styled to perfection. Delicious food. Perfect portions. Great timing between each course. I am never disappointed any time I go here. My favourite restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"This could be one of the best meals of my life!  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The ambience was phenomenal.  They had old de la soul, tribe called quest and jazz playing.  The herbs were taken straight from the pots under a light on the bar.  They drinks were creative.  Now the food-ridiculous!!!  So good!  No need to say more.  One seating a night so no rush.  Great night!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with my favorite girl, aka (my sugar momma of love) and all i got to say is bravo guys very well done.  Now lets see, where to start? Our appetizers where exquisite. I got the octopus and squid appetizer and it was mouth watering. And my honey bunny got the duck ravioli which was probably the most delicious duck ravioli we have ever experienced in our lives!!! The main course was a special surprise.  I got a duck that was presented to moi (pardon my french) that came in a bowl with rice a fried egg and vegetables. The duck meat was cooked to perfecting coming off the bone and then chowing down with chopsticks (extremely fun). My woman got the eggplant ravioli stuffed with risotto, and yes i did say eggplant ravioli!! (First time for us) Thanks for the delightful dinner that really made our trip a special one! Peace n love yo! Over and out..."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous place.  Quaint little bistro with a highly innovative chef and wonderful service.  From the amuse bouche all the way through dessert every dish was beautifully prepared, innovative and delicious.   This place is a gem and a wonderful discovery for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  By far one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Speechless! This is a must try if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is VERY special. Small but intimate, effortless cool invested in the decor (ape skull x-rays hung on lightboxes on the walls, brick, industrial lampshades), and absolutely sublime food.   To understood how good it is, they once opened for breakfast a few years ago and served astounding dishes, like eggs in sunflower oil/milk and curry cakes, and the place was MOBBED by patrons. The owner/chef couldn't handle the load so he went back to lunch/dinner only.  I would say this place probably rotates in the top three French restos in the entire city."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing ambience. The menu offered three/five/seven courses, with vegetarian options available. We've opted for the three course option, and all of them also include an amuse bouche to start. The menus change seasonally, and this time, we were served a beef carpaccio eith french mascarpone, on top of beets with candied yam. The texture and flavor of the dish was all layered perfectly. Next, we had the duck ravioli with foie gras sauce and pesto basil.  Again, perfectly done.  The sauce was very flavorful but not too overwhelming, and the pesto basil added the surprising touch that made the dish extraordinary. For the main course, we had the grilled duck breast with hoisin sauce with sesame seeds and grilled vegetables. The duck was beautifully cooked, and the sauce complemented the dish perfectly. The vegetables tasted excellent eith a smoky taste. Lastly, we had the pineapple three way for dessert. It was a jelly on top, popsicle and chocolate ganache on top of a pineapple slice in the middlr, and a compressed pineapple sauce at the bottom. We liked the popsicle as it tasted very refreshing. Service was excellent as the servers explained each dish as they were served. Water filled frequently, and servers were very attentive.  Overall, we would definitely come again when we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"A tiny, personal gem; while the decor is quirky, the cooking sparkles. Some bistro faves you 'd know (bavette), but some surprises like their fabulous house-made lobster sausage. A small but well-chosen and priced wine list. Expert service. The pace is slower because they assume you want to dine, not re-fuel. In response to the person who posted \"his\" star rating system: I *have* brought professional chefs here, and they loved it. \"Cooking from the heart, and a generous one at that\", said one. So I am giving it 5 stars. Only caution is: no air conditioning in summer."}
{"text":"Small and cozy, I loved everything we had here. We had the pork belly & duck ravioli w/foie gras sauce.   Everything was well-cooked and then we had a great panna cotta to end the night."}
{"text":"Very original and delicious food. The service was exceptional. Its a very small place and the waitress had time to answer all our questions and make excellent recommendations. I think next time it would be cool to sit at the bar to see how they prepare the food. If you're a foodie, I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very refined dishes made of thousands of flavors decorated artistically with the best ingredients and taste blended in such a different presentation that makes you wonder how could such a small restaurant delivers such a great art !! A must try for a different experience and different taste , bravo for the chef and the caring staff !"}
{"text":"This is a teeny tiny restaurant, situated right next to the Soupe Soup on St. Viateur.  It is charming and cozy, with somewhat bizarre artwork (x-rays of monkeys?).    The menu is simple French fare -- two different types of steak, lobster sausage and duck risotto, and of course, fois gras and ris de veau.  It has an open kitchen, and dessert and wine options listed on the blackboards.  I saw one vegetarian option listed.  Definitely not a place for large groups -- when we went, it was mostly couples eating there.  The service was excellent, and the food was cooked perfectly.  I had the bavette, which was very tasty, and had a bit of my husbands filet, which had hazelnuts on top -- which I didn't love, but the meat was cooked well.  Dessert was fondant au chocolat and ile flotant, both done very well.  We started with some amazing baguette from 3M bakery on Mont-Royal -- our server highly recommended visiting there for their pasteries as well, so we will.  It was about $50/person (with tax+tip) for our meal.  I love this place for an intimate french dinner in our neighborhood, it was worth the money!"}
{"text":"An outstanding exquisite dinning experience. We took the pescatarian menu and it was a 5 course divine diner. Highly recommended and excellent value for money"}
{"text":"Christine and I had one of our best meals ever at Les Deux Singes de Montarvie on Weds. night, our final night in Montreal.  Our table had my name on it, indicating the care that each set of diners receives from an outstanding service staff.  The food, from amuse-bouche to dessert, was excellent -- artfully prepared, creative, beautiful to look at, and, of course, delicious.  I would have liked a bigger piece of sea bass, my main course in the Pescetarian tasting menu, but otherwise the portions were good and I left feeling very content.  Christine had the vegetarian tasting menu, which was outstanding as well.  We didn't opt for the reasonably priced wine flight ($30), but would definitely try it next time.  The wine by the glass selection is small but also reasonably priced and offers a good range of rouge and blanc.  Loved the background music and the whole vibe of the place, which is intimate but never crowded or loud.  It is the type of restaurant you feel good about choosing after scouring all the reviews and one you want to visit again as soon as possible (and once they change the tasting menu, about every 3-4 weeks). Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's been a while, so I forget the specifics, except that I know that I left feeling like I had to go back again. Given the number of good restaurants in Montreal that I have yet to try, going to the same place twice has high opportunity costs, but I think it will be worth it with this place. Food was unique and delicious. Ambiance was good. Maybe I'm a little too swooned by the fact that it's on St. Viateur (a street that I love)? But I swear, that's part of the whole experience.  They change their menu every 3 weeks, so there's lots to try! Looking forward to going back this summer (probably need to make a reservation now to do that - they book up real fast and far in advance!!)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service were excellent. The food was good with some great parts. They have only two menus, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with no choices to make... it's one of the two. I didn't like one of the items, so they subbed for the vegetarian offering.   The question in the end... would I go back? I'm not sure. Without being able to see the menu on the day before I reserve ahead of time is problematic. Nothing seemed special enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped into the restaurant - an unassuming storefront - we felt a sense of warmth and welcome. This persisted throughout the meal, a delightful and satisfying tasting menu dining experience. The amuse-bouche was wonderful, the salad full of wonderful surprises - each lettuce pocket with a different delectable delight - and both the regular and vegetarian choices superb. All courses were subtly multi-flavored, and passed through the palate smoothly and pleasurably. Overall beyond superb - we can't wait to go back to Montreal to repeat this wonderful experience, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Simply the best. Great service, great food and cocktails. Flavorful but doesn't make you feel greasy or too salty. Everything is well balanced and refreshing!! Coming back in a week! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I never been to les 2 singes and now I regret it ! L'île flottante is an awesome experience. We had the 5 courses meal with wine pairing and wow ! The pairing were spot on ! The food was awesome by itself but with the wine, it was just something else ! Never had something like this before. I am picky about certain ingredients that won't even look (raw fish or meat, goat cheese) I had both in my plate and I just loved it ! It proves that when you are talented, you can convince anyone. The 3 courses dinner would have been enough. It was a major food coma after but totally worth it !"}
{"text":"OK this is a work of art restaurant and it is officially my favourite one this year :) We got the five course tasting menu and each dish was a wow.    First of all the presentation is amazing and each dish is gorgeous.   They cook with flowers so it adds both to appearance and taste.   The flavours come together to form a sort of poem in food... I can't praise this place enough if you could give them more than five stars I would. The service was impeccable-  we have special food requirements and they were able to accommodate us while changing the dishes creatively so they still tasted amazing.   Furthermore the wine recommended to us by the sommelier was just perfect.   All in all this is a gem of a restaurant and by the way the price for such a treasure is beyond reasonable."}
{"text":"Really? You all think it is that good?   An amazing local french bistro is very high on my list of \"wants\" for Mile End and I was excited to try this place.    The staff was indeed excellent, but I wouldn't exactly describe the cuisine as \"innovative\" or, for that matter, \"delicious.\" Everything we ate was oil/butter-laden (literally congealing on my plate), over-salted, and rather uninspired. The decor is dark (think steampunk meets 12 Monkeys) and self-conscious.   Maybe I was there on an off night, but I'm reluctant to drop that much money again to find out. If I do, however, I'll reconfirm...  Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great restaurants to choose from, why risk it? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible. 5 Star: I'm comfortable taking chefs here."}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed in this restaurant, especially after all the good reviews. Is it possible that the kitchen is just a little too creative? The service was very good, but we were a little put off by our (male) server's open toed shoes and open shirt. The swordfish was a little over salted and the pasta was just okay. Atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Great place! The ambiance is wonderful, really cozy and casual yet careful to the details. Service is excellent and the food, although the menu is very short, is very very good! For me the highlight of the evening was without a doubt the îles flottantes we had for dessert. oh my god! I'll be dreaming about it for a long time!"}
{"text":"Des oeuvres d'art dans l'assiette. Chaque composition est méticuleusement pensée et les mets sont aussi bons que beaux. Des menus a 3,5 ou 7 plats. Chaque plat est pas très gros mais au final même avec un menu 3 plats nous avions bien mangé. Beaucoup d'options végétariennes, des fleurs ou des herbes en deco. Des mets de saison. Des couleurs et des textures variées dans chaque assiette. Plutôt un lieu entre adultes, moins recommandé pour un souper en famille."}
{"text":"Incredibly creative food with no pretentiousness whatsoever.  If you are seeking creative approachable cuisine with flavors and combinations that \"pop\" this is a must try.  A tasting menu was a new experience for us, and I was a bit wary of going here and trying \"tweezer food\" as I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of dress, and general \"stuffiness\".  The atmosphere could not have been more welcoming and casual without losing its higher end feeling.   I was also worried about not knowing what I was eating - would I even like it or know what it was.  Again my perception could not have been more incorrect!   They do like to keep their dishes a surprise and will tell you what a couple of them are beforehand so I will leave it to the rest of the yelpers to describe the dishes.  I was so impressed with the way they \"reimagined\" certain dishes, and I also loved the focus on vegetables !  I understand the menu changes every couple of months also so I will definitely make another stop here the next time I am in Montreal and would recommend it highly.  For our dessert they put some candles on to celebrate our anniversary- love restaurants that pay attention to the notes in the reservation also!    We did the five course menu and it was plenty- we felt satisfied on leaving and not overly full.  It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"What could I say?! This place is perfect, I just came back from gastronomic heaven like San Sebastián, have always a lot of comments about food everywhere I travel (and I travel a lot), but deux singes does not need one, they passionate about their work, it's all what counts! I love this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Good but expectedly expensive French 'nouvelle' cuisine. Service is a bit slow. Place is a bit cramped. But the open kitchen runs the show, and everything I tasted there was very, very good. With less audacity than Le Cinquième Pêché, though."}
{"text":"Here's the TL;DR  Great food  Excellent atmosphere  Fantastic service   The small dining room is nicely decorated. Although there is not much space it does not feel crammed. The food is world class. Every course was unique, well-balanced, and nuanced. The open kitchen is clean, and quietly efficient. The waitstaff met our every need and provided us with friendly, informative descriptions of each course. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is interested in having a world class meal."}
{"text":"FOODIES ONLY!!! Per Trip Advisor, #1 resto in Montreal. Our food experience was totally on par. Decor was not 5 star, but who cares! The dishes were very artfully done and tasted equally delicious. The bison tartare was so good. Duck Ravioli were worth the raves and try. Next time I will try the pork belly and duck leg. There was nothing I wouldn't try/eat at this place. Service was also so good and friendly too!"}
{"text":"It is true, this place deserves more than 5 stars.  It's wonderful in every sense: small, very relaxed, very friendly yet very professional.  They serve local organic ingredients.  But the food is nothing like you can imagine.  The incredible talent and passion of the chef is evident in every dish.  You will be blown away by the food and it's very reasonably priced, too.  Everybody who works there feels like a part of the family.  I wish them all kinds of luck, they are amazing, very creative, wonderful people.  I will be going there next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best dining experience in Montreal and in general. I am so happy we got lucky and got a table just walking in on our very last night in this city.   The food was perfect. The service, magnificent. The drinks, excellent. Everything about this place was just absolutely perfect. Shawn was our server for the evening and his hospitality was superb. If we lived in Montreal we'd definitely be back.   Thank you for such an amazing last night in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by a local - it definitely meets my Yelp quality scale.    Small place - you can see the kitchen and everything that is going on.    Service  is friendly, helpful and attentive.    The menu is small, but probably something for everyone.  There were a few specials I was tempted on, but I decided to go with scallop ceviche as a starter and then the pork tenderloin as a main course.  Both dishes has exquisite presentation and a wonderful combination of flavors on the plate.  Other diners with me had the endive salad with goat cheese, which was so pretty it could have been a food magazine cover.  The wine list is small and listed on a chalk-board mounted near the ceiling, but will do and the prices are reasonable for what is offered.  Dessert was excellent - berries with creme and creme brulle.  Overall I would come back, if not just for the meal, but also to hit up the bagel place next door.   They were SO good the next day - I see why people rave about them...    I couldn't find it when driving by twice - where is the sign?"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 5 people for dinner on December 30th, and while it may have been a quiet night due to the holidays, this was absolutely one of my favorite food experiences.   We had incredible service from our very knowledgeable waiter (Pascal?). When one of our guests asked to substitute a side, he graciously asked that she try it first as it was meant to go with the dish, and if she did not like it, he would bring her something else. A very diplomatic approach to a common situation (and she loved it).   We lingered for 3.5 hours, and never felt rushed. Our waiter was also kind enough to split our check up without us even asking (even dividing a shared appetizer and a couple of bottles of wine among all of us). That would NEVER happen in NYC. I was truly impressed.   Amazing service, cozy yet refined ambiance, and delicious, straightforward food.   I will definitely go back next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Highly overrated & overpriced. Did not enjoy anything about this place. Sorry I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Absolutely a phenomenal contemporary French cuisine restaurant right in the heart of Mile End! I went here with a friend and had some truly outstanding cuisine. Highlights (current) are the watermelon soup, the veal tartare, and the Arctic char dish.  Fantastic service, flavorful and inventive French cuisine, and a great wine selection. Really can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Went here with very high expectations. Didn't come out amazed.  We were two people and had the 3 course menu with an extra 5$ to try  the scallops dish.   The amuses bouche was a carrot cake. Good taste and the crème fraîche was good but this was more of a sweet dish and would have preferred something salty to begin with.   The king oyster mushroom was my favourite dish. So tasty but not enough!!  The scallop dish was ok. Nothing special. And I am a huge scallop lover  The duck was very good. The figs made the dish special but again portions were too small.   The desert was an almond cake with ice cream and meringue. Nice but nothing to write home about.   All in all I was happy with the visit  but the portions were too small for the price. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated chefs in Montreal, still in his 20's and talented beyond his years. Chef Sean's new menu is executed perfectly with peak seasonal ingredients. Service is always consistent and even flowing with the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wow!  That's the word I would use to describe my foodie experience at this wonderful resto located on st-viateur.  This resto definately deserves 5 stars. All of the dishes I tried were beautifully plated and the combination of different ingredients created wonderful flavors that would please any palate. It is definately worth trying out. The resto itself is small and perfect for a date night,  special occasions or friends get together. The service was super friendly which created a warm cozy environment . The chef is a true artist and does an excellent job at taking simple ingredients such as broccoli to create wonderful mouth-watering dishes! Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"A true gem restaurant. The interior, ambience, food, drinks, and service are spectacular.  Really great menu with some original choices.  The bean soup is a nice hearty start. If you like duck, make sure to order it. Truly a special place for a dinner for two, but they were very accommodating when I asked for a table for 10.  Lastly I love the fact that you can see the pros working in the kitchen."}
{"text":"A tremendous place.  My wife and I went to Les Deux Singes de Montarvie last Saturday for dinner. We were not disappointed. When we arrived, we found our name on a small chalkboard sitting on what was our table. The decor is eclectic--very, very eclectic--but somehow works well. The restaurant has the feel of a small, quirky neighborhood restaurant, even though the food it serves is anything but ordinary neighborhood fare.  To start, I ordered a cocktail. I forget exactly what it was called, but it had whiskey (I think), Amaretto, and kumquats. It was fantastic. My wife went straight for the wine, ordering (for both of us) a bottle of rather excellent trebbiano. A note about Les Deux Singes' wine list: It is small, but it appears to be very well curated. Additionally, and especially for those of us who have grown accustomed to New York wine prices, the bottle prices are eminently reasonable.  Back to the food. There are only two menu options: nonvegetarian (regular?), and vegetarian. I chose the former, whilst my wife chose the latter. For the amuse bouche, we were brought a fried(?) zucchini blossom stuffed with eggplant and mozzarella. It was fantastic. (It was also substantially larger than any amuse bouche I've had before.  Rather than go through each individual menu choice we had, suffice it to say that everything was marvelous. Additionally, service was fantastic.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Voici un petit resto qui gagnerait à être connu. Ils font de la cuisine française traditionnelle et fine. La décoration est très originale, avec une cuisine ouverte. Et ils proposent des vins. D'ailleurs ils proposent même plus que ça : la dernière fois mon conjoint et moi hésitions sur le vin à prendre, du coup ils nous ont en fait goûter deux pour nous aider à choisir! Ils offrent aussi des tapas en entrée ce qui est toujours très agréable je trouve. (Oui, j'ai bien utilisé le mot offrir, comme dans offrir gratuitement...) Et sinon, je vous recommande sans hésiter leur foie gras, leur carré d'agneau et surtout, surtout leur île flottante qui est une vraie tuerie! Côté prix, je dirai correct vu la qualité des plats et du service : compter environ 60$ pour une entrée, un plat et un dessert."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant we have been to in Montreal and we've been going yearly for F1 for geesh I think 17 years.  I found this place on Yelp (thank you Yelpers!!!) and we were so impressed with it.  From the quaint setup and seating (old garage?), fantastic staff/owners, fresh greens/herbs grown at the bar, lighting, and then the food....oh my... amazing.  I will add some pics but they don't do the tasting justice :)  The chef sent over a sampler of something he did with eggplant.  It looked like a scallop and had a consistency that was very similar.  My husband is not fond of eggplant at all but he loved this treat.  I am not a big eater in one sitting so the server offered up two appetizers as an alternative and it was an excellent option.  I had the Veal Tartar and Braised Pork Belly Carpaccio and both were incredible.  My husband had for a starter the Nicoise Salad and his main was the Pork Cheek Ravioli; both again so great. Oh yes and their drinks are great and creative. I recommend their slant on a Caesar.   This restaurant has great owners that really care about their customers, they think outside the box but not crazy outside, and it is definitely a place we will be coming back to.  Treat yourself, look these folks up; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"An excellent meal.  Almost best I've had this year.  The attention to detail that goes into each plate is amazing.  Top marks on presentation.  Top marks on building layers of flavor."}
{"text":"They just opened friday the 27th of October, the place expanded having acquired the lease to the neighboring space. It's quaint and calm. You neither feel stuffed nor do you feel too exposed, the seating arrangement is spacious and even when full the restaurant doesn't feel busy.   I opted for the 5 course set menu (you had the choice of 3 for 45$, 5 for 68$ and 7 for 85$).   The meals were a combination of fresh market ingredients of whatever is in season.   There was a dish of duck ravioli, braised pork, spigarello, mushrooms and a delicious squash seaweed.   I have attached some pictures of the new restaurant and menu. (Which, according to the server will change every 6-9 weeks or so)  I highly recommend you try it.   Ps. Try the warsaw cocktail it's strong and surprisingly good (12$)"}
{"text":"Ten Stars. Deux Singes in Montreal is one of the best restaurants ever. It is a world class restaurant with outstanding cuisine. The quality of the food and level of service is fantastic. There is a reason that (sometimes) there is a month wait for a table reservation. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"We eat at many places that feel like restaurants - as one would expect.  Occasionally, we come across a restaurant where they cook for you and serve you like you are in somebody's home.  I've felt this way in smaller restaurants in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, but rarely in North America where great food typically comes from professional restauranteurs or restaurant groups.  At Les Deux Singes de Montarvie, the owner works the floor taking hours and checking on any requirements that a guest may have.  She also makes the cocktails.  The staff is pleasant and the setting is intimate.  The food was truly excellent as was the presentation, but the desert was the best I've had in my entire life.  I'm not usually a big desert guy, so this is strong statement of support."}
{"text":"Wonderful service & amazing food. What else could you ask for? It lives up to the hype.... The food was beyond amazing and our waiter was the ultimate professional! It is a very small place so I would suggest reservations. The menu is provided in both French & English and our waiter was bilingual. The menu is very limited with just four choices for appetizers and four choices for entrees but we knew that before we reserved. I would suggest checking out their menu online to ensure everyone in your party can find something they like. This was easily one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in."}
{"text":"Excellent everything! Service was fantastic and the food was creative and delicious! Great evening out!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and a great meal.  The website didn't do much to explain the place so had to base our decision on yelp reviews and they worked yet again.  You have 3 set menus to choose from and each one is 4-5 courses.  Ample food and the dishes were all very well done and interesting.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such a high rating on other sites. We went there because Tripadvisor users rated it as the No. 1 restaurant in Montreal. We were quite shocked when we were presented with the food especially when how all the users rated its outstanding presentation. The presentation was very old school and not that great at all to be honest. It was more like a mess with some dressings dripped on the side.   And the taste is very very average at best from the appetizers to the main courses. Any popular Montreal restaurant would beat it for taste for sure. The service is super slow too. Don't go there if you are hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Just sensational! Cozy place in Mile End Montreal that has everything going for it. Great ambiance, amazing dishes and excellent service. Every dish we consumed was superior. The two appetizers which were the baked endive salad and the duck risotto were beyond orgasmic. The mains, a curried red snapper and the emu special were great and the chocolate fondont dessert was wonderful as well. We eat out at home in NYC all the time and this might have been the best meal that I've eaten in years.I wish they would serve this stuff in Brooklyn. Did I mention that the duck risotto was stratospheric?"}
{"text":"I think it was rated number 2 restaurant in Montreal on tripadvisor. We actually went to the number one place (europea) and this place was 100 times better! Getting reservations for a Saturday night was pretty difficult, so we ended up having dinner at 9pm.  The restaurant is small in a cozy not cramped kind of way and all the servers were super sweet. They have an open kitchen concept, so you can watch the chefs do their thing. I asked our server why the place is called \"two monkeys of Montarvie?\" I could totally be butchering this story, but he told me that the original owners were doing some kind of  motorcycle race in a village and got lost. Ever since then they were referred to as the two monkeys. The staff thought that maybe the village they got lost in was Montarvie, but apparently such a village does not seem to exist. I was in a semi delirious state when he was telling me this.. this could all be made up?  The bread they brought out was warm and very fragrant. I think they sprinkled some cinnamon on it. It came with delicious whipped butter.  Since I was still full, I decided to order the duck ravioli in entree (appetizer) size (4pcs)  and try to leave room for dessert. BIG MISTAKE! The raviolis were very, very thin but chewy and OH SO DELICIOUS. I can honestly say it was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. WAHHHH.. I was soooooo very sad that I didn't just order the main portion. I'm crying inside right now =*(  My fiance ordered the \"boar belly, braised with beer and soy, accompanied by a parsnip and cauliflower puree, and roasted almonds.\" This was also very delicious but not as delicious as my precious ravioli.   As much as I wanted to try their desserts, we were both incredibly full and super tired. How much I'd pay.. to have that ravioli again.."}
{"text":"My recent visit to this small restaurant in Mile  End had me quickly convinced why it's been ranked as the top restaurant in Montreal!   The upscale bistro is small (although they will be expanding next door soon) with an open kitchen in the back where you can see the micro greens and edible flowers on display used in the plate presentation. The space is quaint with a romantic feel thanks to the low lighting, dark tables and pretty wall art.   This restaurant serves a refined tasting menu of eclectic dishes that are as beautifully presented as they are flavourful; the layering of fresh ingredients and textures was incredible to say the least! The menu changes seasonally and so I am already looking forward to my next visit to see what surprises the young but ultra talented chef has in store. There is no a la carte option, only three menus to choose from: regular, pescatarian and vegetarian ranging from 65$ to 55$, respectively; a steal considering you get 4 courses plus an amuse-bouche of that caliber. The wine pairing was perfection at an affordable 30$. We had the regular menu which included scallops, red cabbage purée, lardon, cauliflower mousse; quinoa with nuts and citrus salad; the amuse-bouche of broccoli mousse, sesame ash and charred broccoli and shishito peppers, verde and caviar; the cassoulet main; and a dessert of lemon coconut churros.   As if that was not enough, the incredibly generous and attentive staff made for a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"If you decide to go here, I'd recommend going the last night of your trip; this restaurant seta the bar for Montreal eateries and that is saying a lot.  I had braised wild boar belly and it was cooked perfectly. Their attention to the presentation was impeccable as I watched the manager meticulously placing garnishes. The wait staff was polite and friendly and attended to the six of us with genuine warmth. They have a good wine list; we had a Chablis that was excellent (which seems to be a rarity in restaurants any more). I will return to Montreal just to eat here."}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant (only 8-10 tables) has excellent food & service.  We chose this restaurant based upon reviews from the internet, and I think it lived up to the hype.  We visited Montreal for 4 days, and this was our favorite dining experience there.  We had the chicken heart pate as an appetizer. braised pork belly, & duck ravioli.  All were excellent.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant which manages to stand out even in Montreal, a city filled with amazing restaurants.  This is a small (24 seat?) restaurant, with challenging reservations on most nights. However, the food, service, and experience are totally worth it.  My dinner companion and I split two tasting menus (the meat menu and fish menu), with wine flights, cocktails, and tip, for about CAD 130 each.  Each dish was interesting (although with a focus on quality of ingredients and preparation, not \"weirdness\"), and good wine accompaniments.  Probably the best was the lamb dish, although really everything was good.  Unlike a lot of tasting menus, each dish was pretty substantial, with more than enough to share a few bites.  I'll definitely go back when I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"First off, this place deserves more than five stars. True that Montreal is full of good eaters but this place is totally worth the 10 min uber ride from downtown Montreal. Two sets of menu one is vegetarian $50 and the other one is regular $65. Every single dish and every little details about anything this cozy little place has to offer is absolutely fascinating. Creativity, nutrition, organic ingredient and taste, everything is five star! Price? It's a steal ! I'd pay $150CAD for this meal for one person alone !! If I come back again I'd totally head here again !!service was very attentive, friendly and accommodating at all time. You will love when you arrive u see your name on the table already !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it is easily in my top 3 restaurant list in Montreal.  Their duck ravioli with fois gras cream is scrumptious. I still think about it sometimes and get random cravings for it. Usually I'm the kind of the person that can't stop talking during a meal but this was one of the few times where I was too concentrated on how good the food was to say a word.   I had the fish of the day as my entrée, I savored every bite and enjoyed the explosion of flavors in my mouth.   I also liked the fact that they gave us little appetizers in between courses, it was a very nice touch.   I wasn't wowed by the desert which was a panna cotta but that was probably because I was too full from the rest of the meal. I heard their ile flottante was amazing, I can't wait to go back and try it out.   If you haven't been yet, don't walk, run!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 arrived at 6pm , just as the restaurant was opening, on a Thursday evening. Service was prompt. We could choose between 3, 5 or 7 course meal, but there was not an option for an a la cart menu.  All 6 of us tried the 5 course meal. Food was pretty good. The veal was tender and juicy but the sauce was disappointing. The duck ravioli could have been perfect except it was too salty. Vegetarian dishes, surprisingly, stole the show - Dessert dish, mushroom dish, and beet dish were absolutely wonderful. 4/5 stars. Next time I would opt for 3 course meal and stick with vegetarian options.  Atmosphere: casual and unpretentious. Dark modern feel.  Overall, good."}
{"text":"I liked my visit at this restaurant. Friendly staff, good flavors, elevated menu. But honestly, I didn't LOVE it. It was good, but not to remember as other restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a cozy little restaurant!   I walked on St -Viateur so many times and never noticed the restaurant until my friend proposed to go there for dinner.  Yelp reviews are great and it is definitely accurate. We went for the tasting menu for $60 each ~ you can also choose a vegetarian  version.  We took both and shared.   Let me tell you that the planting is beautiful and the taste of each dish is simply delicious!  The portions are not big but at the end of the meal I didn't feel hungry anymore...it was just right!   The restaurant is not big but you don't feel crowded at all. ..it is quite cozy and intimate. If you are looking for a romantic restaurant and amazing food, well this is the place! I also love how they write the name of the person who reserved the table on a big piece of rock and place it on the table :)  The name of the restaurant is not mentioned outside so make sure to look for the address."}
{"text":"Rustic dishes, deconstructed but hearty. Minimalistic but friendly atmosphere that successfully pulls off some uncommon stylistic choices."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood gem! Casual yet comfortable and intimate ambiance. Short menu but packed with flavour.  Adequate wine list with many wine by the glass. Amuse bouche, complimentary from the kitchen that changes frequently. What's not to like about this place?   My only critique would be that the menu is short ... Almost too short, only 4 options for both starters and entrees. This is fine if you are only two ppl, but as soon as you are a group and want to try different things, the choices are quite limited and you all end up ordering the same thing. Maybe increase the choices by 50%?"}
{"text":"This cute little restaurant is simply incredible.  The food is delicious. We had the duck ravioli with foie gras and scallops ceviche with kiwi as an appetizer. Needless to say the foie gras mousse is so good that we wiped the dish with the warm bread that was brought to our table at the beginning of the dinner.   Main course consisted of the famous braised pork belly and catch of the day. Don't miss the pork belly dish, it has an amazing combination of ingredients. The catch of the day was grouper served with tiny baby potatoes and bacon, bacon baby, a fish dish with bacon can't go wrong and this one was outstanding!  For dessert I had the caramelized endive with goat cheese and citrus, which for my surprise is listed as an appetizer in the online menu. Appetizer or dessert the endive was great. The other choice was the chocolate mousse with cherries, my favourite!   The cocktails in this resto are made with love, spicy caesar with a white pickle and old fashioned with amaretto were certainly perfect choices to kick off the dinner. The small list of wines is carefully selected, it is rare to find sauvignon blanc with so much character as the one we chose to go along  with our food.   Last but not least the service is great. As the pause between the different courses was a little bit long the sweet staff brought us single dumpling as amuse-bouche to consume while waiting.   I'm coming back for more and next time I'll be sitting at the bar to observe how this magic food is prepared!"}
{"text":"What a culinary experience I had dining here. It's like eating a master piece, a perfect balance of beauty and substance!  This is why I love Montréal, great food and services and value for the quality of food.  The drinks they serve are very well balance as well, not drown out by the alcohol or syrup.  The appetizers were so cheerful and bright, it simply reminded me of happy summer time.  Each of our main courses we ordered were all great on its own. I will let the pictures speak for themselves.  It such a nice little place. Too bad it can't take a party bigger than 6, else I would bring the entire party to savor the experience!  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Saturday evening dinner.Great restaurant in a remote neighborhood but close enough.Charming staff.Only seats about 25 people.Hipster ambiance.Tapas style fixed menu.We shared the standard and the vegetarian meals.Both were notable.Waitress was most charming and pleasant.Will revisit next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fantastic cuisine and service. We had an incredible experience. The food was interesting, innovative, and the flavors were well balanced. Our waitress was lovely and gave us great suggestions for bars nearby. The chefs are very humble and friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Possibly the best French restaurant I've ever been to, even after considering the mediocre ambience and setting. The food is perfect. The flavors compliment each other so well. The tasting menu was a great choice although I initially gave it little hope. I thought it was just another fancy resto that used eloquent descriptions for a so so product but I was wrong. I truly enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Not sure what the naysayers are looking for in terms of food but in my opinion, this place has incredible food.   We dined there on a Friday night (immediately upon arriving in Montreal and checking in) and we had an excellent experience.  Service- 5/5: Our server was polite, funny, knowledgeable and very accommodating. She was not obtrusive but checked in enough to make else feel like we weren't forgotten. She even called us a cab!  Space/Decor- 4/5: The place is definitely intimate. Which, coming from NYC, means it's small. However, you don't feel crowded and the patrons are able to have quiet conversations. The actual decor is on the rustic side.  FOOD!!- 6/5: It was delicious. My dining companion was served a tuna carpaccio amuse bouche and, after discovering I was a vegetarian, she brought me a sambuca jello shot served in a frosted glass with a rim of pink peppercorns. Appetizer for him was a soup so good that he was still talking about it the next day. For me it was a salad of seasonal veggies which doesn't sound exciting but actually was. He had boar belly that made him want to lick the plate. I had a risotto that I couldn't do justice because I was too full. Presentation was nice, food tasty and portion sizes weren't grossly huge but more than enough to satiate."}
{"text":"The food and service were phenomenal at this restaurant. I knocked off a star because I am a dessert fanatic and was disappointed with the dessert served that day. Otherwise the courses were wonderful and as a vegetarian I greatly appreciate their vegetarian menu. I don't appreciate beets and stay far away from it but the amuse-bouche was solely made from beets and I loved it! Great restaurant and glad we got reservations!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant Les Deux Singe de Montarvie with a different name and a different decor. No more pictures of monkeys on the walls lol. The owner, chef and staff are all the same.   The first time I went to Les Deux Singes was a few years ago and it blew my mind. The second time I went I was less impressed because the menu was Asian fusion and I didn't like that. Nonetheless I was excited to come back and try this restaurant under a different name. It definitely lived up if not surpassed my expectations!  I got the Warsaw cocktail which was so good! It contained vodka, calvados, apple juice, rosemary syrup, lemon juice and bitters. I was worried that the rosemary taste would overpower everything else but it wasn't the case. It was strong but also a bit sweet but not too sweet. It was perfect.   Basically there's no food menu and you have to choose either the three, five or seven course tasting menu. We chose three because choosing the five course meant getting two extra veggie courses which did not appeal to me whatsoever. Plus $45 for a three course meal is a steal! It's like going to a fancy resto during mtl a table!   Before the first course we got an amuse bouche. Basically it was a slice of beet (aka beet carpaccio)  with marscapone on top and caramelized hazelnuts. It was so delicious! I only eat beets because it's healthy but if beets were always cooked this way I probably would eat a whole lot more of it!! Plus I love when I get extra stuff besides what is written on the menu.    Next came the duck ravioli with foie gras sauce and a mushroom tapenade. I think there might have been some spinach in there as well. This was my favorite dish of the night. The pasta was so fresh and the sauce was so rich.   My boyfriend's favorite was the next course which  was the veal with blue cheese on top and grilled veggies. The veal was actually pretty thick and it melted in your mouth. I personally love blue cheese but for those of you who don't, don't worry it doesn't have a very strong blue cheese taste. The veal was amazing! The grilled veggies however did nothing for me.   Lastly my boyfriend ordered the île flottante dessert which was $8 extra. It was like a fancy banana split but the bananas were sliced up and they were at the bottom of the plate with ice cream, pomegranate and a caramel coulis on top. This was definitely the better of the two desserts. I had the dessert that came with tasting menu. It was a slice of pineapple with pineapple sorbet and dark chocolate ganache. It was very pretty to look at. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. It was a bit too much pineapple overload for me. Considering everything before it was outstanding I expected the same from my dessert even though I'm not really a dessert person to begin with.    That being said I would definitely come back. It's such a cute little restaurant and the food is delicious and pretty affordable! The menu changes every 2-3 months. Go if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"Very fine 5 course dinner! Our primary server, Alex, was great, with good knowledge and insights into the foods and wine.  We enjoyed the 5-course meal and left absolutely nothing on any plate.  Perfect wine pairing.  Nicely attentive service by all. I like that! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought Notkins would be the best meal I had in Montreal, but now I think this place tops Notkins!  Got the: a.  smoked mussels amuse bouche - really good texture b.  pork belly - exquisite! I think this is a must-order c.  duck ravioli - good but personally I didn't think it was exceptional. The skin of the ravioli could be thinner"}
{"text":"I cannot ask for a better place to eat in Montréal. The atmosphere is almost as funky as the restaurant's name. An X-ray observation lamp with two monkey heads and what appears to be an X-ray film of a hip can be spotted on the wall of this hipster garage restaurant. Very nice touch indeed.   We started off with cocktails. I had the amaretto kumquat old fashioned which was amazing! Different from the traditional but worth breaking the rules to explore something more refreshing. Also to mention that our server was very helpful and understanding throughout our entire stay.   Every dish was presented like a gem and tasted like heaven. Each element on the plate went so well with each other. If every restaurant offered food as good as Les Deux Singes de Montarvie, the world would be in a better place  If someone asked me where they should go eat in Montréal - Les Deux Singes de Montarvie would be my answer."}
{"text":"The food and service here are close to perfect (if not perfect). We did the $65 pp non-vegetarian tasting menu (which changes on a regular basis), and enjoyed every course, from the broccoli/shisito/fennel/black caviar based entree, to the beautifully delicate quinoa/citrus medley, the deconstructed \"cassoulet\", and the lemon/coconut meringue and churro dessert. The atmosphere is cozy, intimate and unpretentious. Great value for this price point, and a wonderful date night option."}
{"text":"Ok, here we go.   I hate pricey restaurants. I think they're pompous and pretentious, rarely living up to the hype.   Les Deux Singes does not fit that bill. This restaurant blew both myself, a prior restaurant manager, and my girlfriend, one of the best chefs I have ever met, far out of the water.  We came in with no expectations, and were pleasantly surprised immediately upon walking in. The atmosphere is intimate, nuanced, and polite; the polar freakin' opposite of La Queue de Cheval (in my opinion, one of the worst restaurants in Montreal). After being directed to our table, with my name chalked in on a plaque, we sat and met our waiter. He had on a pretty sweet pair of glasses and a comforting disposition; extremely unobtrusive and respectful. We already knew what we wanted - the tasting menu - and ordered while discussing wine pairings with the waiter.   Instead of upselling the crap out of us, he suggested his favorite - the second least expensive wine on the menu - and described it in excellent detail. The wine came out, matched up beautifully to the description (something that, in my opinion, is very rare), and set a precedent for the meal to follow.   The food started coming out from the quiet, aromatic, and wonderfully choreographed open-air kitchen that was literally 10 feet away. Writing a review for this place is tough, as it is exceedingly difficult to accurately describe this food. It is mind-blowing. Both my girlfriend and I are gardeners, and the produce that they brought to the table bumped our standard of what \"fresh\" meant. The techniques were absolutely inspiring (broccoli foam?!). The plates were remarkably balanced. The flavors popped, but didn't compete with one another. The best part? These two seemingly-insatiable patrons were full when we left (score!).   I don't know if it was the wine, the non-confrontational environment, watching the co-owners hustle alongside their staff, or the absolute shock I was feeling from the food, but I walked out of there in a trance. Our meal, after tip and with a bottle of wine, came in around $200 and we felt it was worth every. single. penny.   If you want the best dining experience in Montreal, go to Les Deux Singes. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"This will be a very short review because I don't know what to say that hasn't been said over and over. You don't come here to eat a meal, you come here for a true experience of the senses. What the chefs can achieve with the use of fresh herbs is truly spectacular."}
{"text":"This is such a great find. With only seating for about 25, is has that quaint European bistro feeling that could transport you just about anywhere. Food was delicious and spot on, cooked to perfection. A creative mix of flavors and colors and a presentation that would make any chef proud. I loved the open kitchen and especially the small chalk tablets placed on each table with the name of our reservation. Portion size was generous and well worth the extra $$."}
{"text":"We've been feasting with family and friends for an entire week and Les Deux Singes de Montarvie really stood out. It was probably the best meal we've had in a very long time. I love the fact that we were greeted with a special sign with our names on our tables. The attention to detail at this restaurant is exceptional. Each plate is presented as a piece of art and the edible flower petals and sprouts add a lovely touch. I would highly recommend this place for a special date or a celebration with family. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I'll explain why this is the best restaurant i have ever been .!!! Its been said we eat with our eyes first.... there is no better place as this one on that regard .!! Their dishes are beautiful presented ... as if every dish is a piece of art ... the meticulous work Chef Sean Murray puts into it is outstanding!!. The flavour every dish has ...is not just pretty ... flavours are there too.!! The friendly service .. the whole team at DS is very attentive and friendly.!! What you get for what you paid ... on all the restaurants i have done so far DS is the best Value vs quality 65$ is a bargain ..!!  And add 30$ for a wine pairing ..!!!  The menu they offer is worth way more than the 65$ they ask for .!! The restaurant it self ... is beautiful very intimate with an open kitchen ( they will be closing the kitchen with glass soon .. so the chef can have kore privacy ) the lamps are made by a local artist ..wooden chairs wooden tables ... and every table has a granite brick with the name of the person who placed the reservation ( very original touch ). They change their menu every 6 to 7 weeks .... to make you ( like me ) go back and try every single menu.!!! For all those reasons and more .... this place deserves nothing less than 5"}
{"text":"Literally one of THE best meals my husband and I have ever had! A bit pricy but surprisingly decent portions for the prix-fix menu. Every dish was very unique and hand-crafted to perfection -- we could attest to this especially since we were sitting at the bar and watching the chefs work their magic, making sure each plate was impeccable. Most notable were the tender, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly over a mushroom risotto sauce, and the stuffed quail. The quail sauce had the perfect balance between sweet and savory. Overall the ambiance was also top notch. Not overly formal/snobby but classy at the same time. Very relaxing, and we felt the pace was perfect for a relaxing date night. There was absolutely no sense of feeling rushed. Although not the cheapest place ($60 per person for the prix-fix menu which included 4 dishes + dessert, leaving us perfectly satiated) but we definitely plan to return during our next trip back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this restaurant - small, intimate, quiet setting with an extremely friendly staff. They greeted us and treated us as if we were regulars.   The 4 course tasting menu was more than filling enough and we felt each dish provided a different flavor and was delicious in its own right. While we left full (with a take home box), we made a point to remember this place for our next visit and recommend it to friends and family. The cocktails were also very delicious. While a bit pricier, it is a great value and you get both high quality and quantity for your money."}
