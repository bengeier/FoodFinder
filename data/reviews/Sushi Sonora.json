{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. Its overpriced, dry and does no justice to prove just how good sushi can be. To make matters worse I found a eyelash in the roll that I ordered. Definitely never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Tried the sonora roll, it was the bomb!! :-),carne asada, avocado, cream cheese, rice, deep fried!!"}
{"text":"Tienen pobre servicio. Tambien es casi impossible a ke contesten el telefono.. Como kieren aser negecio si ni pueden aser algo tan fazil, asta parese k me andavan ignorando por k llamaba y no contestaban, sigiia llamando y luego estava ocupada.. 

Despues de comer - llame para k me agregen 2 platos a mi orden, les dije k keria dos platos extras en total 3 y me dijieron \"ok ya esta listo\" como es k estava listo si apenas los acavaba de ordenar? Cuando llege a la casa me di cuenta k los extra dos k compre no eran iguales, y para cabarla estaban frios... Para mi k me dieron dos platos k algien no recogio.. Super mal experencia hoy."}
{"text":"It's nice to have this option in the neighborhood I just wish there were more options on the menu, nut I do realize I'm not in a Japanese sushi restaurant so it is just different for me.
I love the Kono Hand Roll and there are. Few deep fried rolls l have tried that were good too. I love that you get three different sauces when you order sushi. One ponzu, one teriyaki type sauce, and a spicy mayo sauce.
The flan is to die for btw."}
{"text":"Hace algunos días fui con mis hijos a este lugar en cuanto entre el mesero nos miro muy mal, junte algunas mesas para sentarnos todos, y ya estando sentados el mesero se me acerca y de una manera muy prepotente y enojado me dice que por favor no dejara que mis hijos anduvieran corriendo y gritando que porque los demás clientes se molestaban, y en ese momento no había más que una persona comiendo, cuando mis hijos en ningún momento se habían levantado, en vez de acercarse saludar y preguntar que queríamos de comer, lo que pasa que esta persona se molestó porque usamos casi todas las mesas Y si llegaban más clientes no iba poder acomodarlos, y obviamente no iba tener propinas, ese fue todo su problema, se me hace una falta de respeto muy grande hacia mí y a mis hijos, a esta persona le hace falta mucha educación y el lugar este, entrenar gente que sepa tratar a los clientes..
Así que por favor atención.. si tienen hijos nunca los lleven a este lugar porque los van hacer sentir como cucarachas,  existe un tipo de racismo hacia los pequeños...
Jamás en la vida me vuelvo a parar en este lugar..espero y ustedes lean y tomen en cuenta de lo que les estoy platicando!
Espero el dueño de este lugar tome cartas en el asunto, y contrate gente con educación y experiencia!!
Gracias!!"}
{"text":"I am Extremely surprised to see only 3 star reviews and under, my husband and i have been coming to Sushi Sonora for 2 years now and let me tell you that we love this place. I am such a frequent costumer that the cooks already know me and if there's anything that's important about a restaurant is that its CLEAN, and this establishment is clean. You can see how the cooks prepare the food (which in my opinion is important) The \"manager\" here is REALLY professional and iv never seen a customer treated with disrespect. I know the sushi are $10 and over but honestly you get a meals worth. If you get a Cielo Mar y Tierra you get 12 sushi slices the crab mix and carrots, chipotle and some sort of black sauce and a jalapeno for $11 and its delicious! The cooks here are very fast but take out can be a bit of a bummer since the waitresses here are the only down fall. In all honesty iv had them forget my order twice  and i had to remind them, i did not make a big deal about it because i understand its not easy to keep track of everything when you have people waiting on you left and right. Regardless i LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Wow hot spicy  mix of asian and Mexican had the sushichiles and kona hand roll both excellent  Don't be timid this is really good stuff"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, The Sushi are crazy!! you get 12 sushi slices the crab mix and carrots, chipotle and some sort of black sauce and a jalapeno for $11 and its delicious! The place is very clean.  I've been coming here for 3 years and absolutely love the Sonoran Sushi Rolls."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to try this out, but my other half insisted on it. He ordered a fried sushi with chicken, steak and shrimp in it and I had the teriyaki chicken dish. Mine was really tasty, but a little on the sweet side.

The restaurant itself was nice. A little hole in the wall Hispanic place. They had the hobbit movie playing on the television, so that was fun to watch while we ate. We were greeted in Spanish when we walked in, but since I don't speak it, the waitress was happy to speak English for us.

All in all, great little find. Next time I'll be a bit more adventurous and try some Mexican sushi."}
{"text":"Great variety of sushi at reasonable price. 
Love the dipping sauces and fast service 
Check it out !!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, reasonable prices. This is going to be my regular place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yes I'm Hispanic, greeted in Spanish and I replied in English, was treated rude from then on. I ordered and asked if he can make it spicy, he said it's a little spicy already. I asked well can you add spice. He said not really....lol seriously. You cant add a jalapeño? Some sriracha? Besides the crab mixture was not flavorful. Guy was rude, greeter (cashier) was not inviting. I recommend Senor Sushi if you want a culture mix with good food and kind service."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable. Obviously not a traditional sushi restaurant, more relax environment. Received our food quick, food was ok huge rolls. Ordered the Sonora roll, ceviche roll and Vegas roll. A lot rolls have the cream cheese deep fried style. Had a large family come in after us (20 guest) and we were kinda forgotten about. Was checked on after our food arrived and eventually had to ask for our check. Used the restroom and still didn't receive our check. 
The food is Mexican sushi fusion, tried it and not a huge fan."}
{"text":"My sister and I needed a carb loaded yet crunchy induced binge to recover from our hike at Papago park. Anyway, it was empty when we arrived but as the evening progressed, our plates arrived (Shrimp Tempura roll, The Extreme Roll) so did the people. At this point the party was popping and so was the party we were having in our mouths. Each piece of individual roll was like making out with Jesus and Fergie; the crust was flaky but not oily, and the rice was hydrated enough -not too watery, not too dry, so it maintained its shape. The shrimp was fresh and tasty, as was the side of crab and shredded carrot. Yeah. Comes with that. All in all, definitely a great place to come to for cheat day for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and I love how they are open a little later. Ordered the Japanese wings and Ceviche roll. Wings were amazing... hot as hell and lots of flavor. The sushi was ok. They use cheap seaweed and you can taste the difference. I would have liked to see more variety on the menu. I think with a little more quality ingredients they could kill it."}
{"text":"The bad reviews are odd, I've been coming here for 3 years and absolutely love the sonoran roll. Sometimes the waitress doesn't speak great English but food is very good."}
{"text":"Ok not too much fun of mexican suhi. Love the Japanese sushi period..... dont like the fried sushi prices are way to expensive and not even good food. I won't be back because too expensive, no happy hour and don't like fried sushi sorry not a good place for me to eat"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love it here! It's so different and delicious. The server was so nice and was helpful when we picked our sushi rolls. I would recomend this place to anyone looking for a food adventure!"}
{"text":"Great food & prices! Excellent service Will be our go to spot, when heading to or from airport. 
Owners should consider bottling their dipping sauces for purchase."}
{"text":"3/5 Stars Overall

I was very excited to try this place, as it combines my two favorite foods - sushi and Mexican food. We ordered a total of 5 rolls. Our top choices are the Cielo, Mar y Tierra roll (chicken, steak, shrimp, avocado, cream cheese) & Ceviche roll (shrimp, cucumber, avocado). The ceviche was very smooth and the hot sauce gave it a great spicy kick! The cielo, mar y Tierra was fried just right and a great combo of ingredients. The other two rolls were ordered were baked in tin foil (new concept for me!), Potan's Roll (crab mix, salmon, shrimp, cream cheese) & Percheron Roll (meat, chicken, bacon, avocado). Both were tasty as well but the flavor wasn't as great. Definitely a heavier roll... too much food for 2 people!

I'll definitely be back, and can't wait to try other Mexican sushi places as well."}
{"text":"Came here starving and craving sushi so badly. There was no one in the restaurant so we sat and the lady handed us a couple menus and went back to the counter. A few minutes later about 3 people came in and she gave them menus, took their drink order, went to the back to prepare their drinks, served their drinks and proceeded to take their food order. Meanwhile, my family is sitting here with no drinks and ready to order our food. That is just the rudest most unprofessional service I've ever experienced. Can't comment on their food because we walked out and decided to take our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutly love this place. I LOVEEE everything on the menu"}
{"text":"I love this place . So many good varieties and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place, not your traditional sushi it's got a Mexican twist and it was good! The rolls were huge and we got very full. We got the extreme roll, ceviche roll, the Las Vegas, and chicken nuggets with fries for the kids. Service was a bit slow and got cut off while ordering so the waitress could answer the phone which took a bit, but other than that it was good & will come back some time."}
{"text":"This is the second time we visit this new location and it's awesome (they have alcohol)! Very clean and the customer service is great. The food was delicious, as usual! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure people understand how yelp works :) 3/5 stars is a hard rating when everything you have to say is pretty positive.  If you like good food and good prices, then give it a shot. I've been there twice now and the service is great, food is above average, and prices are very reasonable.  They have large portions, so definitely share with someone.  

My suggestions for the business:  
1. Cater more towards English speaking customers. (Flyer is hard to share with my friends at work) 
2. Work on a better sign for your location. (sign kinda looks like a hot dog, and I drove by your place a hundred times without it catching my attention)
3. Warn people about the heat level of your dishes. The Chiles were actually way hotter than jalapenos. (I loved it, but I know some people that would have passed out)"}
{"text":"This is my own personal opinion. Not saying Mexican-sushi lovers are wrong, just that it's not my cup of tea. 

The Mexican flavors get severely dialed down by the mostly tasteless seaweed and sushi rice. 

The Asian flavors are too subtle to reveal themselves through the very strong sauces. 

The crab mush served with everything is tasty,  but not enough to warrant the premium price reserved to medium - high quality sushi. At 11-14$ per roll, one could expect better than battered rice and a sprinkle of unapologetically bad carne asada. 

Clean place, great service."}
{"text":"This Mexican sushi place is small. What we ordered seem to look a little plane compared to other Mexican sushi places we've been to, but the flavors were good. I'd like to try a couple more rolls off the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Definitely interesting, especially if you choose one of the rolls that's very different from what you'd get at a conventional sushi place--like the roll with carne asada. Service was good.

The rolls are probably twice as big as the sort of roll you'd see at a conventional sushi place. We didn't expect that. A single roll was very filling, especially my battered-and-fried roll."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our third time here. I am thoroughly sold on this location!!! Service was EXCELLENT!! We ordered our food and it was brought to our table, a while later we were brought another roll because the cook thought the initial roll was too fried! We hadn't even complained or noticed it at all but it was so great that the cook did that! Also, when we were leaving and got boxes to go, I asked if I could buy a bottle of their special made soy sauce and a while later, a young man came out and said they don't usually give sauce away but it was on the house. It was AMAZING of them to do such a sweet thing! My recommendation is for them to begin selling bottles of their house made soy sauce! Fantastic location, fantastic service and fantastic food!!!!"}
{"text":"RIQUISIMO !! muy recomendado, con promociones toda la semana, excelente lugar para ir en familia, muy entretenido con musica en vivo, los mejores de todo Phoenix !!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOSO !!! recomendadisimo !!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the ratings just for it to be a on the contrary from everyone's options on how good the service is here. The whole time there our waitress was not attentive after getting our order she never came back not even to ask if we needed refills on our drinks. Secondly it took forever to get her attention to give us the check... the place isn't big so she couldn't have missed us. When it's time to give her our card to pay she's in the back talking.I raised my hand so she could see and her and the cook started talking shit as if we can't hear them saying that \" I don't understand why they get so mad when they're just going to tip a dollar\" ... first of all a dollar is probably too much to tip a waitress who can't even manage this ten by ten ft establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying new sushi places but this place was by far the worst place. The waiter was horrible we sat there for 20 minutes before getting our drinks.she then tried to serve us our food and we still did not have our drinks. Now to the sushi, the sushi rolls are bland and they give you different sauce which is clever but they serve it to so you are able to cover up the blandness if their sushi. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. AND THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY ALCOHOL!!!!"}
{"text":"No, no, and no. Just don't. If you're looking for good sushi, go somewhere else. I get the whole Mexican sushi concept, but this was just bad. I will leave it at that. Take it for what you want. Feeling adventurous and want to see if this yelper is wrong? Be my guest. You'll be $40+ poorer and will curse yourself for not listening. Two stars are for the cleanliness, but honestly, good service and cleanliness should just come with any dining establishment."}
{"text":"This Place Is AMAZING ! I Only Come Here For My Sushi Because They Are The Best. So Far I Have Probably Tried About Half Of The Menu And I Have Yet To Be Disappointed. I Have No Idea How I Found This Place But I Am Glad That I Did. When I Found It I Was A Little Skeptical About Trying The Latino Sushi Rolls But Boyyyyyy! They Are Much Better Than The Traditional Sushi Rolls. I'm In Love. The Live Bands At Night Are Great. This Place Offers A Chill Vibe. I Spend About 2 Hours (sometimes more) When Ever I Come Just To Take A Load Off My Feet."}
{"text":"Been here 3x and can't wait to go back, love all the rolls so glad they have Mexican sushi so close to my house"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior change your mind of the food. Their food is amazing!  The sushi rolls are HUGE so order light. I will for sure be back!!!"}
