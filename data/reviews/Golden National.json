{"text":"If you like deep fried blobs of batter in sugary sauce, you will like it.  Mall Chinese food is comparable, if not better.  I've tried a few items and always disappointed."}
{"text":"Other than the pouty face put on by a server / hostess when we walked through the door at 8 pm on Saturday night (I mean really. Who dines at 8 on a Sat night?), the overall experience was excellent! I think Pouty thought she was going to lock up and go home. Thankfully, Pouty was not our server! A very polite elder woman looked after us! We had drinks quickly and order in. The food arrived promptly (by this time several other diners had arrived - sorry Pouty), fresh and hot. Portions were ample. The menu selection is typical I guess but very good. I recommend the S & P Squidly. Prices are reasonable. The biggest difference is that this not a renamed Jade China Inn. Apparently completely new ownership. Definitely recommend! Very nice to have another good dining optiion in M-Towne!"}
{"text":"Out for dinner with my daughter, we both enjoyed The Shanghai Noodles item N2, quantity of chicken, shrimp and pork was excellent, however portion sizes for the price seemed a little less. The Beef Fried rice although offering a good amount of beef, it had absolutely no flavour, restaurant management seemed to be more interested in the take out orders than the customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever. Spent close to $100 on New Year's Eve. We went early (5ish) for take-out. Ginger beef was chewy and had no sauce, seafood was overcooked, everything had an odd taste and terrible. Will not be back. Just awful and disappointing."}
{"text":"Chicken in the chicken fried rice was a little sketch, seemed like last week's dried out leftovers. The lemon chicken was tasty, but no where near enough sauce and was chicken balls, so a little different than the breaded cutlet style. The mixed veggies were very good. And unfortunately the ginger beef was average to slightly below at best as it had an odd taste to it. All in all not a disaster as the food was overall alright, but it was the little things that keep it from being really good."}
{"text":"Really great Chinese food! We really enjoyed the curry chicken and black pepper beef! The only unfortunate thing is your order must be over 40$. This was a little too much food for just two of us. I'm not a fan of leftovers."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the new McKenzie Towne location. It was just my daughter and I so we only ordered a couple dishes. Ginger beef, sesame honey garlic chicken, chicken fried rice and a spring roll. Called the order in and was given a 30-40 minute time for pick up. Thought it was a bit long seeing as it was a small order on a weeknight. The spring roll was still crispy and the main flavour you could taste was just carrot. Chicken fried rice was great! Sesame honey garlic chicken was great ...large pieces of chicken and the sauce was nicely flavoured. Now about the ginger beef....how has no one commented about the ginger beef?!!! LoL. This is the one menu item that will cause us never to order again. It's not a traditional flavoured ginger beef that Calgarians are used to. It has an overpowering floral/perfume essence to it and is very unusual. I'm not sure what they add to it and I recognize the flavour from some Egyptian sweets I had one time. I tried to like it. Tried to embrace it. But alas, after 2 hours of burping up greasy perfume, I just can't say that it's good. So be prepared....if your favourite dish is ginger beef, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was excellent when first opened but not as impressed last few visits and have moved on to another local Chinese restaurant. Lemon chicken is excellent, otherwise food just average. Usually do takeout and like the discount for paying in cash! Dine in service good but beware the owner....every time I have eaten there she has to come and talk about how wonderful her food is and carry on and on. I am usually with friends or family and I would like to visit with them NOT the owner! Very annoying."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am a regular but I just can't  help it....They are sooooo good! The service is always bang on and every dish comes out piping hot.
Judy the owner always comes over to check up on us.
See you next time!!

{"text":"I ordered take out but had a difficult time finding the place. Made two circles around the traffic circle before I could find it. There's no parking so i had to park at the sobeys and walk to it. 

We ordered sweet & sour pork and beef & broccoli. The sweet & sour poor looked and tasted old; it was hard and chewy. The beef & broccoli was much better taste good but it had celery in it not sure why???? 

Overall not the best Chinese food but there's not much selection this side of town."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour, and order menu item N2. It's the Shanghai chow mein with Szechuan sauce and all the meat is perfect every time. Their ginger beef is kinda lame, but the dumplings are delicious too. It's that shanghai chow mein that's to die for when you need a fix."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night because I live nearby and we got a coupon in the mail so we decided to use it. Everything that we had last night was delicious. Absolutely no complaints. They have good deals where you can get individual combination plates, etc. My boyfriend and I shared the Large World Wonton and it was large. We at the whole bowl and were full so we each ordered combination plate to take home. 
My boyfriend went here a while ago and hated it because he got something with chicken and when it was served to his table he said the chicken was raw and when he told the waiter he said no its not we steam it so it still looks pink when its not so my boyfriend never wanted to go back but because we got the coupon I made him and we just got no chicken products so he was glad we went back ."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Looks like fast food, everything oily, greasy. Dumplings very doughy with the meat inside gray color and no taste. The pork was too salty. Rice was overcooked and pieces of chicken looked weird. Wouldn't recommend this place to my friends for sure."}
{"text":"After a year of going without a good night of Chinese food I'm happy to have found this place. The menu is typically western, which was what I wanted tonight. Good selection and a few dishes that I didn't expect to see. We were ordering for a crowd so we did have quite a few options. Averaged out to about $11 a dish. So the value was there for sure. The meat dishes all came with a lot of meat. The veggie dishes were just as loaded. No cheap filler veggies like huge chunks of onion or cabbage to be found anywhere! 
I'm just moving to Calgary and most likely will not live in the neighbourhood but I will make a point of coming here."}
