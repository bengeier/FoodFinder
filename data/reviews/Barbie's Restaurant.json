{"text":"Really bad. First we waited 25 minutes for our food.  Then comes my over cooked smoke meat omelette with 8 little french fries that I swear were leftovers.  Really, really bad. A star for the nice waitress."}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant, we were a large group and seated with one waiter for breakfast. Out of 28 people, 11 found hairs if their meals, so owner offered 15% off! Coffee refills were hard to come by as we were ignored by all other staff and waitresses but when you find hair in your food everything else doesn't really matter. 

Wow, amazing to think that a place like this could still be on business, worth a drive anywhere else, do not eat here, absolute waste of money.

I gave this one star as I could not remove it, no stars is what I would have rated it."}
{"text":"Je comprend pas que le resto soit plein. Il y a tellement de bon restaurant dans la même gamme de prix tellement meilleur. J'ai tenté l'expérience une fois et ce sera la dernière."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, bland food and service is hit or miss.

I've been to Barbie's several times in the last few weeks.  

Food: I've had smoke meat, pastas, pizza, french onion soup and several other dishes.  The food is really bland and seriously lack any seasoning.  When I ordered the \"pizzaghetti\", the pizza portion was fine but the spaghetti was way overcooked and sticky to each other.  Not enough sauce added to the spaghetti which made the dish very bland.  At best, this only provided colour for the overcooked pasta.  The smoke meat is good but can be cold at times.  I returned the french onion soup because it smelled and tasted very odd - as if the onions used or the soup base was just too old (Not sure how long they keep the recycling going before preparing fresh batches). FYI: They did comp for the soup. 

Cleanliness: Bad.  Don't look up near the air ducts as you can see some kind of growth.  Pick your table wisely.

Service: Hit or miss.  One waiter in particular seems to always be in a rush.  Runs by your table, extends an ear and listens to the order before rushing off (about a dozen customers in the place at the time of this order).  For my drink I ordered \"iced tea\" but he brought a \"pepsi\" on the table before rushing off so I couldn't correct him in time.  It was only 20 minutes later when he brought the main course that I was able to correct him about the drink.  He did apologize.  I've been served by this waiter on 2 separate occasions and both times he was working as if in a rush all the time.  Doesn't listen well.  There are good waiters as well which I tip well.  I don't know how to approach the situation that I don't want to be served by certain waiters.  I did not bring these issues to management as they are not easily identifiable.  Hopefully they read their customers' comments online."}
{"text":"Service déplorablement lent, jai eu l'impression de déranger la serveuse. Repas pas bon et arrivé froid en plus. Erreur sur la facture a la fin. Je n y retournerais pas."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Food all seems like it was from a box and cooked from frozer. But thank goodness there was free popcorn to fill us up. Possibly the freshest thing in the place."}
{"text":"Barbie's is a friendly place. 

I was there on Sunday morning waiting to meet my friends for brunch.  I was early and the staff sat me immediately and plied me with coffee until everyone arrived 40 minutes later.  Once there, I ordered the Onion Soup Gratinee, Fresh Fruit Crepe, and side of Poutine.  

The soup was very good with rich beef broth flavor, crusty bread and stringy melted Gruyere dripping over the sides of the crock.  The Crepe was large and light, with a good quantity of cut up fresh melon, cantelope, blueberry, strawberry, and banana. It came with an English Sweet Cream on the side for pouring or dipping. It was quite good.  The sole downer was the Poutine, which was laden with Brown Gravy and Cheese, but too salty for my taste. I could not eat much of it. 

I think this is more of a local's resto with decent, but not better, food, and a place where everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich was really good, fries were just right and the Rickards Dark was a good addition.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful, even to these couple of English speakers!"}
{"text":"Came here on a very sunny Saturday afternoon  (3pm) with my mother who was used to going to the Deli at Fairview shopping center in Pointe-Claire which has closed since then.
 I thought that this place would remind her of that place but apparently her memories of the place aren't so nice.
And this place (Barbies) seem to be cut in the same cloth.
70's type restaurant stuck in the past, serving iceberg lettuce salads, store bought items frozen then reheated in microwave type of joint.

We ordered specials from their 2 for $23 menu which hangs on a wall in the back of the resto but is nowhere to be found in their actual ginormous menu or on their place mat menu, which is full of other great deals! 
I thought of a late night commercial \"Buy it now and get this knife that will cut through a boot!\" You will need it...

I ordered 3 of my mother's favorites; chicken brochette (tiny) with butterfly shrimps (3) and a half plate of ribs and fries.
Out of everthing she liked the fries best.
The brochette and shrimp were average Diner type taste, nothing special.
But the ribs were definitely disgusting.
Tasteless and not hot at all.
I bet these were bought at Costco (the cheapest ones), are kept frozen and reheated in a microwave oven by a \"chef\" in the kitchen, bored to death.
We sat at the front (dirty) booths where the sun made our experience very hot even though all their blinds were shut.
The floor underneath the tables (after I peeked a look with my Eagle eyes)was littered with breakfast junk (butter and jam cups and napkins and food).
Didn't go try their restroom since we were right in front of St-Louis lake...

Why create a 2 for $23 menu if you try and hide it afterwards? 
\"Get the customers in!\" The bossman says.

I came here before many years ago (8) and I have also tried the Barbies in Laval. It is what it is, someone other than you reheats your store bought food and plate's it and brings it to you. Nothing more.
The waiters all seemed bored and annoyed. (Probably from the lack of clients and the cheapness of the clients present)
\"Is coffee included with the meal\" I asked the waiter.
\"Do you see it written anywhere on the (poster)?\"
Hey answered.
That should sum it all up.
Why 2 stars?
Because even though this is definitely a Kitchen Nightmare candidate, it has some desperate charms and an extensive menu!
I was expecting real life Barbies to be there serving us! (That's a joke)"}
{"text":"Last time I came to this exact establishment was over 14 years ago and they haven't disappoint... 
Great Service, pleasant staff... 
Ordered the Gyro plate and asked to have my rice replaced by more greek salad. There was no issue there.
I also requested for Gin and Tonic. I asked for the Gin and Tonic to be served separately, and again- there was no issue to accommodate me.
Complimentary popcorn is available.
Family style restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was unfortunately disappointed by my Barbie's experience.  I was taken out to celebrate my birthday and while I liked the fajitas and their dessert portions are HUGE, it was all just.. lackluster.  My fiance didn't enjoy his meal and while the fajitas were good, I've had much better- especially for their prices.  I unfortunately don't see myself wanting to go back.  Even their nachos seemed to have almost like a... fake cheese as the topping which was VERY disappointing.  I'm not sure if it was a processed cheese or what but it was not good and it reminded me of movie theatre, cheese whiz nachos.  The prices just seemed way too expensive for what you get so I won't be going back for dinner.  Although, their ribs always smell amazing when you pass by so maybe I'll go back just to try those and have dessert.  My chocolate cake was huge; it lasted me  three days at home!  So for that I would go back.. maybe.  Otherwise, sorry, but no thanks!"}
{"text":"My father and his friends went to this restaurant for their weekly Sunday brunch. The restaurant was easy to find from the highway. The border between Dorval and Lachine, next to the private school queen of angels. 
 The staff was professional and courteous.  Always refilling my coffee.  The waiter refilled it about  8 times.
The order was long and the waiter was very patient with us, we frequently changed our orders. I ordered 2 poached eggs with Swiss cheese and a bagel.  That appeared to be the healthiest item on the menu. It was okay but next time I would just get a fruit salad. 
Also, the breakfast comes with a complimentary fruit salad. 

Being with a bunch of Desi men, they obviously brought their coupons to the restaurant and the meal was even cheaper than expected. The owner came and checked up on us, to see how was our experience, if everything was satisfactory. 

The people at the restaurant are majority  retirees and people with grandkids.  I would come again, just for the coffee and service, it appears to be a good place to read a book and go for a walk along the canal afterwards."}
{"text":"Had rib and chicken fillet and chicken Brochette.  

Fries were good. Chicken was cooked to death.  Ribs had no flavor except for sauce.  Soup was good.  Salad dressing was made with white vinegar.

Over 50 with a couple of beer

Service was slow.

Not recommended"}
