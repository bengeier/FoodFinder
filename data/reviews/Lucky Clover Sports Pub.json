{"text":"2 stars in generous.  Of our table of 5 people we had 4 incorrect drink orders and for an Irish pub I don't believe \"Jameson neat\" should be a difficult thing.  The burger was over cooked and the service took over 20 minutes per drink.  I might try again in 6 months."}
{"text":"I've been here 3x now - probably should have just kept it to 1 but I live in the area so convenience overruled logic. 

Food is meh (somehow even something as easy as chicken fingers wasn't good), and menu selection is disappointing. Waitresses are fairly friendly (depending on who you get) but not overly attentive. 

If you're looking for somewhere to go have beers and watch the game then this is a decent spot. Looking for somewhere to have dinner or a decent meal...take an extra 5 minutes and walk to find something else."}
{"text":"Wow so funny I'm visiting Toronto from Miami and thought wow this place opened in Toronto that was in brickle downtown Miami what a joke not even close meanwhile I was told it's the owner of HOOPS which also was in Miami who failed terribly was sued by his landlord and ran back to Toronto what a joke the guy steals the name from a bar in Miami and tries to open it in Toronto good luck with that everyone will see True person behind it all which is just a failure"}
{"text":"Typical sports bar - décor a bit dated but comfortable. Seated very quickly but they were obviously understaffed for a busy lunchtime. I took the shepherd pie which was ok and my companions took some kind of chicken sandwich that was not very good. The staff was confused as to where the orders were going and the wait was quite long for the food to arrive. Overall average food and tired service. A place to stop for a beer but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow.  Incredibly bad food, poor ambiance (set by weird music and a belligerent guest whom the bartenders were oblivious to), average to high prices...subpar would be an understatement.

Had to send dinner back.  Waitresses were friendly (oddly dressed).  The decor was the one amazing thing.  Ornate, glossy marble floors and warm wood booths... good luck eating it though!"}
{"text":"Surprised at other people reviews - went today, waitress was very attentive and friendly. Food delivered within 10-15 minutes. I ordered lamb Irish stew and a brew. For a pub fare and rainy weather outside it HR the spot perfectly - meaty, tasty, and enough root vegetables to keep belly happy."}
{"text":"Went here at 6:30 on a Thursday. Sat down, asked staff twice for a waiter/waitress to come over and left at 7 without someone even  coming to take our drink order."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the lucky clover befor a ball game and were pleasantly surprised. So many big screens. Our server was awesome and the food was great! We will definitely return with our friends to enjoy a game and look forward to sitting on their beautiful patio next summer!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the complaints are about. The place is absolutely solid. Most sports bars are dumps. This place is clean with great seats and furniture. Decor is classic. Lots of big screen TVs. They will put on any game for you, too. Even out of market games. Service was also great. Waitresses were extremely nice and helpful and wore some cute outfits to boot. Finally, we had some brunch in Sunday and if was also very good. Can't beat steak and eggs for $14 downtown. Quit whining and give it a shot. This place deserves to do well and stay in business."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had. We waited over two hours for food and it never came. Tables all around were leaving. The hostess never told anyone the kitchen was backed up when they were seating people nor did the servers before people ordered. We heard the waitresses all talking about lying to customers over how long food would be. We asked our server 3 times for an update on our food which was only an appetizer and each time she said she would check and never came back! They call them selves an Irish pub yet you can only get small glasses of Guiness. We asked to speak to the manager and then watched our server go chat with her colleagues instead of getting him. Customers were all agreeing with each other that the palace was terrible! We left after 2 hours and our app never came"}
{"text":"Came back again because the location of this bar is absolutely convenient but this time around, I think only the location will keep this place alive for the next while.

Simply put, they cannot even mix a long island iced tea right. The definition of a long island iced tea is that there is no tea in it and it is a mix of multiple alcohol in it, namely vodka, tequila, rum, gin and so on. I complained about my long island ice tea tasted like a lemonade instead of anything. The server brought me back a glass of iced tea and a shot of vodka. Well, that makes it ALL wrong.

Secondly, their potato skins ARE TERRIBLE. They put ham and un-melted cheese on some potato skins, and THAT IS IN!! 

OMG, I just can't comprehend what kind of bar owner would be able to put up with this low quality of basic bar drink and food. Or, I should wonder if the bar owner/manager knows what they are serving to their customers? Come on... this is bar 101...

Finally, whoever that was on duty to clean the washroom probably called in sick, 3 female washroom stalls were not flushed completely. Thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped here because of desperate need to find a bathroom, and we ended up staying much longer than expected.  Our bartender Tony was super friendly and kept our beer and water glasses full.  Five stars for his great service!"}
{"text":"They occupied the pedestrian path by extending their patio way out. Very irresponsible restaurant."}
{"text":"The one star is for the decor, it really is a pity star.

We just left from a dinner service and we less than impressed. No hot water in the bathroom! Cold air in the air dryer! Insane.

Had fish and chips which we thought would be safe but it wasn't, shit fries. The creme brûlée was terrible as well, tasted and had the consistency of a snack pack pudding.

Place needs to do some work and management needs to take a hard look at themselves to save this dive. Bet is closed next October."}
{"text":"Waited over 1 hr for our lunch. In this area, most customers r on a schedule. Ridiculous. Wait staff didn't seem to care. 
Unfortunate as Food was decent."}
{"text":"While I can understand being busy after a jays game you should still be able to provide good service. 

We had two identical sandwiches ordered at our table, One came out properly the second came without most of the fixings.  The answer we got was I can't do anything about it now and they were both billed fully at the end.   

During the meal one of our guests finished their pop and was never offered another.  We had to flag down the server and tell them that we wanted one even though they can to the table many times. 

Overall service can be slow, mistakes can happen,  how you deal with it speak volumes on your location."}
{"text":"We stopped in on an incredibly quiet night - we wanted to try something new in the neighbourhood.  This area of town is always hard to get a great experience in - it's touristy, it can be expensive and it's largely comprised of pubs.

That being said, the one thing that stands out with the Lucky Clover is the interior decor.  It's dressed up beautifully with great wallpaper, high booths and beautiful lighting.  One of the fanciest pubs I've been in recently!  They also have great beer on tap, including my favorite from Ireland - Smithwicks.

The high praise stops there though.  The food was average - nothing came out exceptional.  We sampled randoms categories on the menu and while everything was consumed, nothing was amazing.  The dessert that was ordered at the end was awful - a borderline inedible apple pie that had one bite taken out of it and nothing more.

Overall, a good place if you are in the area but hardly worth traveling for."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here over the Summer in early July and both of us absolutely loved it. They had gluten and dairy free options for my friend and really good strawberry daiquiris. It was a little busy, but the service was good. Neither of us are the type to clear our plates, or even half our plates at most places, but we completely cleared them here and the portions were not small. The food was just that good. I've been recommending this place to everyone I know who is visiting Toronto. 
I got the Irish Stew and it was some of the best stew I've had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Didn't get to eat here but waited 10 minutes (along with a few other parties) and no hostess to seat us. I could see waitresses working (it was not busy at 11:30am) so not sure what was up. Cannot comment on the food but if I assume service and food are correlated. ..."}
{"text":"I got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and it was really good and a huge portion! Took home half since I couldn't finish it. The server, I think her name was Aisha, was so friendly. The service was a little slow but the food was good and the server was apologetic. I would come back for the food and the atmosphere and the friendly service!"}
{"text":"Sweet server could not make up for kitchen. Ordered a burger as did two others at my table. 20 minutes later server came back to say my burger could not be prepared as ordered. I selected another item from menu. 10 minutes later their Canadian burgers arrived. There was a slab of an inedible meat like product on the burger. They pulled it off and ate a mediocre burger while I waited for my order. As they finished their burgers, the server said mine would be right out. After another few minutes, I asked about my order and ordered a drink. Drink came 5 minutes later but no food. Finally my order came. Onion rings were ok and hot but everything else was awful. The meat was lukewarm on one side and stone cold on the other. Not even sure how that happens, frozen meat??  This place does not deserve any stars. Gross!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. On the more moderate side for pricing even though in an expensive area. Service is very good.

Food was okay. Not amazing but not bad. Very upper echelon of decor. You can tell they spent a lot on ambience. 

I wouldn't order any type of coffee or anything like that. Not sure how late night bar drinks are but might try it another time."}
{"text":"Very subpar food and service. Food was very soggy and lukewarm. Waitress was very slow in taking our order and checking in on us. Also, the air conditioner was not working so we had to sit outside."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. A typical sports bar with average food and beer selection. the place is still new so its fairly clean. staff is attentive as well. 

Not a highly recommended place. good to go for a quick drink and food to watch the game if real sports or hoops is full."}
{"text":"While the food is decent, everything else about this restaurant is horrible. The service is lacklustre at best and the servers don't know what they're doing or how to give good customer service. Management is greedy and offer horrific service. It's understandable considering the place is so gaudy and ostentatious that they need to get money to afford it. The layout is stupid for a sports bar as you can hardly see the tv screens if you're in a booth. For a place that is rarely busy, you'd think service or food would be amazing because they have nothing but time. I fully expect this place to shut down and go out of business. They don't retain customers and I'd rather go somewhere further or pricier just to avoid them. Sad considering I live in the building. Highly do not recommend especially in the area. There are many other better places. I doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Came in, was seated at a dirty table by two girls that looked like dominatrixes then waited 20+ minutes and nobody came by so we left. What a waste of time and reading the other reviews here it actually makes sense."}
{"text":"So...I feel bad. I had intended to review the food at lucky clover, except that after sitting there for almost 2 hours, my food had still not arrived. It was somewhat perplexing as the booths all around me were empty, and I had also quite simply ordered an appetizer to start with. On paper the prices are fairly average for food, with an initial interesting offering in terms of meal choices, along with your typical burgers, pasta, and steaks. I had intended on ordering the corned beef and cabbage but never got the chance due to the backlog with the appetizer. 

They offer small and large draft beers, along with pitchers, except the large beer size is only 16oz. $8.25 for Guinness.

You will likely appreciate the decor a great deal as it's clear a lot of effort was put into the place; it is also quite clear that they have desperately rushed their opening, which was disappointing. Plenty of staff around and yet insufficient attention given to the tables, with a kitchen that can't handle a basic load. I'm not sure why the severs are forced to wear bizarre attire though; it is an unnecessary and disrespectful gimmick. 

If you are in a time crunch before the Jays game or a show at the ACC this is not an ideal place to eat. In general there is a lot of work to be done here before things are smoothed out; don't expect the quality, bang for buck or quick service just yet. 

Time will tell, but keep in mind this place is owned by the people who own Hoops. Yes.. that Hoops. Check Dine Safe on that one. At least this place takes debit payments, and hopefully lucky clover forges its own path."}
{"text":"The place is fairly new. The food is decent, but could be better, I'll try to come back here after 1 year  and see if they've improved with the food and service"}
{"text":"Might be one of the worst pubs in the area.... nope, wait, Hoops is right around the corner! Soooo, am I surprised it's the same owners? Not so much. Food is terrible and they don't serve pints.... sorry, that's a lie as the waitress politely explained that they are American pints. I looked at her like she's an idiot. She smiled back at me, oblivious to how dumb the explanation was. Anyway, their US pints are the same cost that every other bar in the area charges for an actual big person beer. Don't bother with this place.  There's way more options around."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever eaten. Ordered the bangers and mash. It was disgusting. I was so hungry I ate most of it because I couldn't be bothered going elsewhere. Tasted like it had been cooked in the toilet bowl. 

My fiancée had French toast and it tasted like sausages. Clearly cooked both in the same pan. Can't reiterate enough how revolting the food was. 

The bar itself wasn't bad. The booth had a high backrest making it fairly private. 

The server was mediocre at best. She tried to take my plate while my fiancée was still eating her meal. 

They only accept visa or cash also. I live near by but will never go back.

Edit: I vomited when I went home."}
{"text":"Never knew the place existed until today, even though it's been right around the corner from work for a year. Came in for a couple pints on a very slow Sunday. My first \"pint\" came in a 16oz glass, the second in a 20oz - same price. Male bartender was cool - introduced himself, let me know he was going on break, etc. The two females seemed more interested in talking to each other. Servers seem to be able to come behind the bar and pour their own pints. Too bad, beautiful place, but has the familiar feel of a place not managed properly. Shitty playlist too - think the staff picks music for themselves, not the customers. Will give it one more try, to make sure I didn't catch them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Wings tasted frozen/gamey, multiple wine/beer options were unavailable from their limited selection, and they don't accept debit cards, which is unacceptable for a place downtown at these prices. Obviously they're cutting corners!

If you want a beer and a meal before the game at a good price, check out Corks."}
{"text":"We were looking to try a new place out in the heart of downtown Toronto and we landed on Lucky Clover. I usually don't write reviews but I felt like I needed to warn others.

We called in to see if they had availabilities and they said come on in we have tables. 

Really nice setup they had at the entrance but once we got there, we waited twenty minutes! That was probably the least of my concerns of the night.

After we sat down, our server didn't even come back for at least another 20 minutes so we had to flag the hostess down again. Poor girl. We ordered wings with fries and pasta. My wife asked if she can have her pasta spicy and the server said no, but we can give you hot sauce on the side. And guess what, she never brought it out. Wings were unbelievably crispy. I felt like they forgot to take it out of the fryer. 

Worst part was my sister caught a mouse run through the restaurant. How disgusting. 

Their card machines weren't working. I had to use my visa on 3 different machines before they found one machine that worked.

And to top it all off. I checked my visa and guess what I got charged 3 times!!

Never going back here again! I'd give a zero if I could."}
{"text":"I came here with my co-workers for lunch. It's conveniently located near our office and we took a chance after walking by a few times. We sat on the patio since it was a nice day. There weren't many other patrons, so getting our orders in and receiving the food was fast.

I decided to order the burger and mash, thinking that it was a burger with a side of mash potatoes. Nope. It is a burger where the bread is replaced with mashed potatoes. It was hilariously glorious. I thought the burger was cooked perfectly medium. The mashed potatoes were seasoned perfectly. Everything tasted great with the Guinness gravy."}
{"text":"Service: Seated immediately; not busy night, took orders promptly and checked in regularly (4/5)

Time: Appetizer came in 20, followed 30mins later by the main courses (1/5)

Food: Lobster dip was okay, had a little bit of a fishy after; ordered garlic steak but they served the regular, asked for medium rare and came out more medium/done; lamb was good, flavourful and tender, but again asked for medium rare and came out more well done; mashed potatos were not warm and very bland; root vegetables were great and tasty; (overall 3/5)

Overall: Not really impressed. Subpar quality of food for price (bill for 2 came out to $80 with tax and tip..) and took much longer than we were willing to wait (total time 50mins). Would rather go up the street to SOCO next time! Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The Lucky Clover is like getting to the end of the rainbow and finding out the pot of gold got replaced with burnt meat and overcooked eggs.

The restaurant clearly took a lot of time with their decor, and have hired a large serving staff- although the music was pretty odd for the venue, and the mens bathroom had no toilet paper...

We were a group of 5 heading in for breakfast/ early lunch. The restaurant was empty, yet food still took roughly 40 minutes to come out.
We ordered the \"irish Skillet\" , soup of the day, brunch burger , spinach and goat cheese salad, and the lamb irish stew.

Irish Skillet: over cooked eggs, sitting on top of completely cremated potatoes/ bacon/ sausages. If you like charcoal this is the dish for you

Soup of the day: This was not even hot, it was room temperature , how do you mess up the soup of the day which probably is pre made in a large basin in the back..

Brunch Burger: We sent the first one back because much like the sausage and bacon in the skillet, this one was cremated and looked like a brick- the second time around was a little better definitely not worth the $15 

Salad: WAYYY to much dressing, and the goat cheese is deep fried? Very odd, and was not good.

Irish Stew: when they say to leave the best for last... The \"chef\" sent out a lamb shank and had the wait staff apologize because they cooked the WRONG meal... We looked on the menu and Lamb shank is not even on there- so maybe they got creative, or maybe the kitchen forgot how to make a lamb stew... In any case this new dish we got was also overcooked, and we're almost certain that the mashed potatoes are boxed.

We were wondering if this was a one off, however the other two tables in there had the same comments we did actually allowing us to all have good laughs together over just how bad the kitchen was.

The serving staff actually told us after just opening they are all embarrassed by the kitchen

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Just had drinks before a concert but was fast and friendly enough. We didn't have food but it smelled good. Bathrooms fairly clean. Good quick place for a drink."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I didn't know what to expect. 

I got my order (lunch) for take out since I work not to far. I called and by the time I got there it was ready for pick up. The environment was pub like. And the food the same. I got a pasta dish and it was ok. Nothing to rave about but wasn't terrible. 

The presentation of the take out was beautiful."}
