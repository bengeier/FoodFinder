{"text":"Great little spot!  Cute and appropriately grungy location (love the building and signage), great food (burnt-end sandwich, YUM!), and a good selection of beers.  Delicious house barbecue sauce.

The chips and salsa were mediocre, but they're not why I stopped by."}
{"text":"My biggest problem here was expectations everyone had set the bar so high. So I was expecting something much better than I was. Wasn't terrible. But wouldn't  say it's the best second-best in the nation 

I had the Two meet combo with pork ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were okay. Nothing special. And the meat involved on. I'm not a fan of vinegar barbecue sauce. So the Georgia peach was my favorite. The cornbread was good. The atmosphere was really cool. Overall Its too bad the expectations were so high I think I would've liked it better."}
{"text":"full of people, but did not wait for a lot time for carryout. Really good food. Price is a little bit high."}
{"text":"Burnt ends are excellent, and they always run out early in the evening. Rib tip platter is very tasty and they give generous portions. I like sweet BBQ sauces, so I really enjoyed the Georgia Peach. You can really taste the peach in it. All of the sandwiches are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon and a very hot summer day.  It wasn't too busy, so we got seated quickly.  However, it was sweltering in there.  Their A/C just couldn't combat the heat from cooking, so we were literally sweating the entire time.  It is also very cramped in there if you are at a table and not a booth. 

The server was quite rude---it was our first time there and we had to ask about the sauces.  She seemed really put out by having to answer questions.  She never smiled, seemed miserable, plunked down our food, and generally made us feel completely unwelcome.  

The food was good, but not remarkable.  I know others on this site rave about it, but I was personally under-impressed.  I have had my share of BBQ and enjoyed it just fine.  However, the atmosphere and service ruined the experience for me.  I suppose if you order take-out it would be better.  Don't think I'll go back even for that, though."}
{"text":"The Champaign counterpart to the Urbana original is very nice and has much more seating, so if you're looking for a shorter wait time this is probably the location to choose. 

The burnt ends are amazing and sell out fast--they are freshly available starting at 11 am and 5 pm. Everything is amazing. Their multiple sauces can be a little overwhelming because you might not know which to choose. But they're all good. The sauce flight is a great idea for the indecisive, or for those eating in groups of 2-3. 

I love getting a platter with 2 meats (typically burnt ends and beef brisket) and a side of sweet potato fries. The cornbread is a good option if you're looking for something seemingly lighter. I liked the green beans (which are cooked with garlic, tomato, and bacon) but they could use a little more heat."}
{"text":"I finally was able to eat at the Black Dog, and I am still trying to understand the hype.  Possibly people in Urbana don't experience good BBQ, but I grew up eating delicious food and this was just ok.  

The seating options were limited and the wait was long.  The waitress was busy but not as attentive as I hoped.  It took a while to get something to drink, but I understood that it was packed and she was busy, so I'll give her a break. 

I ordered the combo: ribs and catfish with the Carolina house sauce on the side.  The plate arrives with small portions and a side of the worst sauce I have ever tasted.  The way the food is cooked must be particular to a certain region because it is not like the Memphis, Kentucky and Texas style I grew up eating.  It was full of vinegar, spicy and nasty.  

The meat was tender, which it should be because it was smoked for 4 1/2 hours, and I wouldn't have expected anything less.  After eating here, I wasn't impressed. So many people have talked about how great the food was, and I should have known better.  The food was okay, and I must say I've had better barbecue in my own backyard."}
{"text":"Black Dog is the best BBQ I've had. The meat always comes out perfectly tender, and I like the fact they give you a choice of sauces. All of the sides are excellent. I usually order the pulled pork and the brisket, although I occasionally will get a hot link. For sides, the twice baked potatoes and pit beans are probably my favorites, with honorable mention going to the sweet potato fries.

I also have tried the burritos (only served at lunch time) and they were excellent.

I live in Chicago now (after living in Urbana for about 6.5 years), and I have been unable to find a BBQ place in Chicago that even comes close to Black Dog. This came as a huge surprise to me since I just assumed somewhere in Chicago there'd be something this good, but it has just been a series of disappointments. When I want BBQ, what I really want is Black Dog.

I recently went down to visit Urbana, partially for an excuse to eat here. 

The beer selection at Black Dog is also phenomenal. I discovered several relatively obscure beers I had never heard that have since become regular favorites. (New Holland Dragons Milk being one of them). I think Black Dog has a more interesting beer selection than the Blind Pig some of the time.

Be prepared to wait a while, but the wait is worth it. They might want to consider expanding to a larger location, one always worries about that since it might mess with success. I think they could probably sustain it though considering this is almost a regional draw."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! Unfortunately, everyone knows it, so the wait can be pretty long (30-40 min) at peak hours. But you can get a drink to pass the time. My favorite is rib tips with Carolina Red sauce, but everything is great here. The beer selection is not huge, but it is always terrific, and they switch it up a lot. 
Service is friendly, and the food is usually ready quickly (since it's all smoked). I eat here at least once a week, and am not tired of it yet! Good thing, since I always take home leftovers."}
{"text":"I have been to Black Dog 3 times in the last week if that says anything. I love their food, pretty much all of it. I get their ribs a lot but their burgers and sandwiches are hard to pass up. Don't forget to add on their sweet potato fries and their cornbread (the best cornbread I have ever had). Their other sides are very good but the sweet potato fries are so amazing its hard to pass them up. The chicken wings are possibly the best in town. All of the sauces are excellent, I highly recommend getting the sample sauce tray.

Downside to this place is the wait but if you go early or late you generally only have to wait 15-20 minutes. I also suggest no more people than 4 as it is a very small place. The bar is a great place to sit so don't count it out.

The beer selection is excellent and I highly recommend the flight if you have some time (and a DD). The cocktails are so good and strong, just the way they should be! 

My biggest wish is that they will open a second location in Downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Outstanding service; wonderful food for its type. The Turkey sandwich, which is not the first thing one thinks of at a place like this, is definitely 10 on a 10 point scale."}
{"text":"Got there early and tried the three meat and a flight of sauces.  Burnt ends were good as was the pulled pork.  The ribs were also good, spare ribs with plenty of smoke.  Was a little disappointed that I got ribs from the small end of the rack but you take your chances, I'm sure the larger ones are better.  The coleslaw was unremarkable but the cornbread rocked."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the food here.  The meat is tender and flavorful.  I usually go for the pulled pork, but the ribs are excellent as well.  The sauce is tangy with a bit of a kick, not a sweet bbq sauce.  They usually don't put enough on in my opinion, so ask for extra.  The ribs have a dry rub that make a nice crust and the meat inside is extremely tender and juicy.  Their twice baked potato casserole is delish, but I think the sweet potato fries need a lot more seasoning.  The cornbread is different, a little smokey and actually has bits of pork in it, but it was great.  The only reasons I don't give them 5 stars are 1) they are usually out of at least one thing (maybe that's part of the allure??) 2) it's really small and crowded all the time and 3) I've found the service to be rude. They make me feel like it's a hassle for them to bring me my food and take my money.  Oh well, the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Champaign.  Really.  Every regular menu item is fantastic (the pork, the brisket, the polish, catfish, etc. etc. etc.)  The bbq sauces are amazing as well. Personally I like the chipotle, its spicy and amazing.  The carolina red is great as well with a nice kick, and the hot georgia peach is an awesome combo of sweet and spicy.  If it were just for this it would already be 5 stars.  But it isn't just this.

The specials might be even better than the regular bbq.  The cuban is the best cuban I've ever had.  The pastrami is the best pastrami I've ever had.  The new turkey club (twice a week) is THE BEST turkey sandwich I've ever had.  The fried cod on Friday might be the best sandwich all week.   Finally, the tacos and burritos here can stand up to Maize any day.

And then there's the beer.  Different craft beers every time you go in there.  Place is just awesome."}
{"text":"Great barbeque, variety of sauces, super tasty specials, superb rotating beers.  You must try the cornbread...it has bbq meat in it!  My fave is the tacos with pork and chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"I came in sometime around 3:30 looking to eat what became my only real meal of the day. (Raise your hand if you've been there before on a Sunday). My friend, a recent transplant to the area, suggested a \"pretty sweet BBQ place\" instead of the much closer and cheaper McDonald's near his apartment. \"Oh, and they also have their own beer.\" Sold. 

So, walking in, the seating space is really rather small for a pub/restaurant - and way too hungry to wait for a table - so we just sat at the bar. I Yelped this place before leaving and was told to try the Burnt Ends but to get there early to do so. Well, they were out. And they were also out of catfish. Luck of the draw of coming in late on an NFL playoff game day, I suppose. I ended up getting the rib tips with regular French fries and the Southwestern potato salad, with the Left Hand Milk Stout to drink. I mean, if I'm gonna carbo-load, why not do it in style?

Anyway, our first server ended up also giving me a small sample of a blueberry ale just in case I'd be coming back or ordering more beer with my dinner. I suppose if I liked blueberries, I'd be all over this, but I'm not such a fan... however, I certainly appreciate the offer. I also ended up having the one beer of theirs they had on tap the night before at a bar, so I didn't want to double dip and ended up going with a Hennepin saison instead.

The food finally came, after many delays informing my friend that supply was limited on catfish and eventually running out of it. The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is very tasty but has a hidden kick to it. With the rib tips, it was perfect. That said - though the fries were great (but maybe a bit skimpy on the serving size) and the Southwestern potato salad was good (but I was almost hoping for it to be a bit closer to room temperature), the rib tips themselves were tender and flavorful, but I thought there was a bit too much fat on them, whether marbled in or around the little bits of bone. The parts closer to the edges were fine, but towards the center were tricky. 

I don't want to imply that this is standard practice, but due to having to cancel both items my friend ordered, he was able to substitute something else on the menu and get comped for it on the bill. Much appreciated. However, our original server kind of disappeared for a while so we ended up being served by a guy that sort of looks like Paul McCartney around 1968, and he did a great job."}
{"text":"The food: great. 

The service: Well, on the one hand they sat us with people who had already arrived which they don't normally do. That was nice of them.

On the other hand, we waited 10 minutes for someone to offer to take our drink or food order. Eventually I flagged down the hostess, because the waitress who apparently was serving our friends who had already arrived and the tables beside us was unwilling to make eye contact with us. 

The hostess took our order and our food arrived promptly. The waitress who was serving the rest of the party brought us all our checks. Ours was for $18.60. We set down a 20, and after she collected all the tickets she didn't bring us any change. I asked her for our change, and then about a minute later she threw $1.75 at us as she was walking past. 

Repeat: our waitress threw our change at us. 

After this I asked to speak to a manager and I was told there wasn't one available. I explained what had happened to the hostess, who while being friendly, made excuses for the waitress (she was working on a lot of different tables) and then reminded our friends that they aren't supposed to sit people until the whole party had arrived."}
{"text":"I took some out of town family members here for lunch this past Sunday. It was crowded, yes. A lot of people look at the line and immediately turn around. Keep in mind, there isn't a lot of room to stand indoors and wait for tables. It's a pretty small place, but the wait is WORTH it!

We started with the burnt ends. If you don't go early, you won't get them. They run out quickly (there's only so many of them since they come off the brisket). They melt in your mouth. They are ridiculously delicious. We also split the smoked wings. The sauce they put on them seems to be a spiced up version of their Carolina Red sauce. They were awesome.

For entrees we had quite a mix. The salmon was great. I even tried the beet salad with goat cheese. Not a normal menu item. I should say that I can't stand beets normally. These were good and I kept sneaking bites of my husband's! The brisket was perfect as was the smoked Polish. My dad loved his catfish, too. 

What really made the meal was our server Matthis (spelling? Sorry if it's wrong). He was funny, friendly and fast. Our drinks were never empty and he seemed to really care that we were happy. 

I wish it wasn't always so busy. I guess it's because the food is so delicious. Like I said though, it's worth the wait. Thanks to everyone there for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I should have left when I arrived on a Wednesday  at 6pm and they were out of 7 of the 8 smoked items on the menu. So I got the pulled rib sandwich. Then I learned why. It tasted like last nights leftovers. Dry, salty, pork jerky. 

There must be a lot of employees pumping this place. They even forgot to deliver my beer."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the Black Dog for some time and finally had the chance after a day of golf. Arrived at 4:45 and thought we would get right in. Wrong, waited about 10 minutes. This is a good sign with that many people there at this time of day during the week. 

Waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and provided great service. It only got better from there. Ordered the three meat combo of burnt ends, brisket and ribs. I have to say the burnt ends were my favorite, but they all were perfectly cooked and the taste was outstanding. I went with the Carolina Red sauce and it had just enough zip in it. I was pleasantly surprised with their choice of beers and IPA's. I went with a tough to find Dog Fish Head Brown Ale on tap. 

I will be back Black Dog very soon. Nice work!"}
{"text":"They have some great BBQ here.  I've done the brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork.  All of them are top notch.

Grab some cornbread.  You won't regret it.

The beer flights are awesome as well.  Do yourself a favor and try some new beers.

You'll probably have to wait to get a seat.  It's worth it.

I've never really felt that rushed.  It is a small place though and I can see how people might feel rushed."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ spot. 
There is always line and sometimes you would have to wait for 1 hour. 
But with beers and cheers it's always worth the wait for the food you get at Black Dog!"}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to check out the food. It's probably great. But was put off completely by the pretentious aloof attitude of the staff. If there is another barbeque place in the area that realizes that service and a smile will get you far. I am surely going to be there instead of Black Dog. I have had nothing but pleasant experiences in the CU area top to bottom. But I walked out of there shaking my head as to why ?  The first time in town that felt that feeling of WTF? and They get rave reviews? See Gary W's. Review.... Wow pretentious  and its barbeque"}
{"text":"I would eat that pulled rib sandwich every day if I could. Give the smokers a raise!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is on my family's regular rotation of great places to grab a bite to eat. I can't recommend anything in particular from the menu because it is ALL scrumptious. The only new advice I can offer is to be very careful pulling in and out of the parking lot. The slant from Broadway is rather steep and doesn't provide much clearance."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite BBQ place in Champaign. The wait time can be pretty long at the Urbana location because it is so small. However, once you get seated, the service is really fast. I love their brisket, and my partner loves their pulled pork. The succotash side is very good, and it's good to add vegetables to a BBQ meal sometimes. The smoked sweet potato is also very good."}
{"text":"super yummy food.  prepare to get messy.  my favorite thing about going here is that i feel like i'm in austin texas or on vacation somewhere.  only downside is: they're always packed. good luck getting in and out fast."}
{"text":"Went here for my brother's 21st birthday and it was pretty darn good.  Definitely get the burnt ends.  Cocktails weren't fantastic and the beer selection wasn't too bad.  Definitely somewhere I'd come back again."}
{"text":"My perspective: I've spent a good deal of time in Austin, Texas, which is the center of the BBQ loop trail that goes through tiny towns like Taylor, Lockhart, and Fredericksburg. The places in these towns are like institutions, with heritage and loyalty passed down from one generation to the next. People are on a first-name basis with the cutter and pit man.

My all-time favorite: Franklin BBQ, which was recently named best bbq in America by Bon Appetit. It's also gotten rave reviews from the NY Times, Food and Wine, and the only perfect rating from fcg-bbq, a bbq joint blog with its nose seriously to the ground, and whose opinion I take to be more authoritative than any national magazine.

I know BBQ is more than what Texans call 'brisket', but when done right, brisket is so good that it's hard to see what else one could want from BBQ.

If you're looking for what Texans call ' wet brisket' or 'moist brisket', here's how to get the most out of Black Dog: go from Sunday to Thursday when the pit man Jay is working. The wet brisket ( or what people around here call 'burnt ends') is best in the evenings.

Order a burnt ends platter, and ASK YOUR SERVER TO NOT TRIM ANY FAT. Tell him or her that you want about a 50-50 meat/fat ratio with plenty of the fat webbing between the little nodules of meat.

Ask for sauce only on the side. Ideally, you won't be needing any.

Make sure to ask for white onions, because they default to red. And pickles. And try to get some white bread.

If it's at all dry or tough, talk to your server and send it back.

Jay will know what you're looking for. He has been to Texas. He will speak your language."}
{"text":"Now I live in Philly and I want burnt ends for dinner tonight and I can't have them and it makes me want to cry.

Black Dog, I love you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the area.  The meat and the twice baked potato casserole are always perfect.  The beverage selection is always changing and this is a tight little restaurant."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've probably ever had. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the wait is too long. So much that I won't go here on a Friday or Saturday night because of the wait. I'd eat here a lot more if I didn't have to wait so long. Otherwise the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Black Dog doesn't disappoint. It's a local favorite, and the service and food is always great. The brisket is the best I've ever had. Try the flight of sauces for variety, every sauce stands it's own."}
{"text":"I haven't had great luck with barbecue in the Midwest, but I was impressed with Black Dog. Our server was really friendly, and our food came out in a few minutes. All of the food was good, but the pork belly and burnt ends were excellent."}
{"text":"I visited Black Dog smoke and Ale house during a snow storm. I was looking for a place to get warm and have lunch. I have to tell you the snow was a blessing otherwise I might have walked right by this place.

My friend and I walked in a liked the pub atmosphere but then became suspect of the food a pub like this could produce. I ordered the combo plate with pulled pork and sausage. The food came out quickly and smelled delicious. When you order you have your choice of sauces and I went with the Texas sauce for the pulled pork and the hot mustard for the sausage. The meats were smoked to perfection and the sauce complimented it nicely. The side dishes of potato casserole and cornbread were probably the best sides I have had in a long time with BBQ. 

The staff was nice, the food was excellent, the place is small but the tastes are big. If I am ever back in Urbana I will be back to try the burnt ends."}
{"text":"What we ordered:

Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ their house Carolina Style BBQ sauce w/ slaw on the side
Brisket Sandwich w/ house BBQ sauce w/ slaw on top (traditional way)

Sides: Cornbread, Baked Beans, Spicy Potato Salad

The meat is tender and flavorful - I preferred the pork, my husband preferred the brisket. The sauce was very good- definitely homemade, not the HFCS stuff from the bottle. It's not as sweet as the thick and dark styles, but its delicious, with a bit of heat. 

The slaw is is vinegar, not mayo-based and mine was fresh and crisp. The cornbread was delicious- the description says it has chilies, beans, and meat in it, and I was imagining something with big chunks or almost like a baked sandwich- when it arrived it looked like a piece of thick cornbread, but when you bit into it the flavor was salty and smoky with just a hint of chile flavor- no discernible pieces of beans/meat. The potato salad was good, but not the best I've had. The baked beans were delicious, with a definite smokiness, NOT the sweet stuff you're used to from pot lucks or the can!

Delicious BBQ!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Ordered pulled pork sandwich, and had serious diarrhea and stomach pain two hours afterwards. Overpriced and will never go back again."}
{"text":"Black Dog is, hands down, my favorite restaurant is Champaign Urbana.  I first visited when it opened and have been back many many times, bringing new people with me each time and converting them into Black Dog lovers just like me.  

The BBQ here is fantastic (declared by a St. Louis girl)!  Whatever you do, you must order their Burnt Ends, either in Sandwich form or as an appetizer.  The pulled pork sandwich and ribs are also great choices, but nothing beats their Burnt Ends.  Another great appetizer is the Texas Caviar, a delicious salsa made with black eyed peas and hominy.  

As far as bbq sauce goes, my personal favorite is the Hot Georgia Peach.  It's the perfect mix of a spicy bbq sauce and the sweetness of the regular Georgia Peach sauce.  

And the sweet potato fries...oh, the sweet potato fries.  What I wouldn't give to have some right now.  I'm not even going to tell you how good they are, you just need to have some for yourself.

This place also has a great beer selection and the servers are friendly and obliging in offering out recommendations.  My friends and I all agree that this place reminds you of a neighborhood bar that you would find in Chicago.  A nice change of pace from all the typical campus bars in CU. 

Some tips on dining here: it gets packed and fast!  Part of Black Dog's charm is that it's a small bar.  Unfortunately, that means limited seating.  If you want to get a seat before the rush, try to get there before noon for lunch (they open at 11am), or before 5:30 for dinner.  If you happen to find a long line when you get there. Don't leave!! Stick it out! It's worth it."}
{"text":"Heres a tip....put your name on the list if there is a line and come back when you are ready and even if you have missed your allotment, you will be next....at least thats the BS that is happening tonight ....BS!!!"}
{"text":"A pretty diverse drink menu, filled with many craft brews & ciders. The smoked pulled pork & beef brisket were delicious & generous in portion size. This place is always busy around typical meal times, but usually quiet in between. (We go around 3 or 4pm & sit right down.) Try the burnt ends if they aren't sold out for the day!"}
{"text":"Great food! Even the small number of veggie items are really good. Be adventurous with the sauces, they are all so good. 
The food comes out fast, so long lines move faster than you'd expect. Also take out is a very feasible option.

Wish they could be a little bigger, maybe 4 additional tables..."}
{"text":"This is one of the (not so hidden) gems of C-U. They have excellent barbeque, not some nasty rib bones slathered in sauce, this is real thing. I highly recommend the pulled pork and the burnt ends, and the sweet potato fries are a must. The prices can't be beat,  you can get a BBQ  sandwich and fries for $7 at lunch or dinner. Just be warned, this place is really popular and the seating area isn't large, so it gets crowded and you might have a hard time getting a seat if you don't arrive early."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for BBQ in C-U. It's almost always packed so make sure you have plenty of time to spend."}
{"text":"ate here twice so far and have been very pleased both times. great food, wonerful smells and atmosphere. go early and be patient.  sign the easel.  you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I've told my friends about this place and I'm pretty sure they don't believe it exists. It is literally a hole in the wall. Fills my tummy with joy.

Pulled Pork is the best. Great sweet potato fries. Not only the best BBQ in C-U, but maybe the Midwest.

Cons: Always busy."}
{"text":"Darn it! Why there is nothing like this place in my town? I'm just jealous with UIUC kids. 
I got there, it was packed so my friends and I have to wait around 15-20 minutes, I'll accept that. Sat down and we ordered the famous burnt ends (TWICE!), sweet potato fries and ribs. Ordered the beers and as a moderate fan of beer, I'll have to say that they have the right beer in stock. Food came, I have to keep myself not to swallow the food because OMG everything was delicious! Especially the burnt ends, it just melts above your tongue and that is why we ordered it twice. 
Place is always packed but hey, the wait will always be worth it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ad the opportunity to stop in the Black Dog on a Sunday afternoon and after a 15 minute wait, was seated at two seats near the back by a server stand. We ordered two of the sampler platters so got a good range of entree's and sides. The food was excellent, the chicken (white meat) was tender and the catfish was smoked through wonderfully. I was not a huge fan of the cornbread, but it was different and I would not hesitate to order it as an appetizer. I also had the beer sampler and there was a nice range of beer to compliment the food. Waitress was friendly and service was fast but we never felt rushed at all. I will definitely stop in next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"in one year i have tried everything on the menu and got fat.  favorites are rib tips, burnt ends, pulled pork, wings, and mac and cheese.  they also have the best draft selection as every week is something different AND good.  recently went through the whiskey list and might even say they give 7 saints a run for their money.  the place is always pretty crowded, which makes me miss those summer two hour lunches with a couple beers.  nothing gets done after that."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great beer selection. I could live on the corn bread and I'm usually not a big fan of cornbread.

Good lunch prices. Be prepared to wait for a table. Great atmosphere with friendly staff."}
{"text":"When I travel, I like to find the small local places in the hopes of discovering a gem and I found one tonight. I had the smoked catfish because 4 other items (brisket, burnt ends, ribs, and something else) were sold out, but it was right up my alley. The corn bread was absolutely awesome. Get there early if you want to full menu but be prepared to wait. They also have a wonderful beer selection to go along with your meal. 

The bartender seemed a little grouchy when I first arrived, but heck,  I am most of the time too, and I don't require much attention anyways. I will definitely be back and a BIG THANK YOU for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Staff is friendly and quick. The food is sooooooooo good! I always get the pulled pork with Georgia Peach sauce. Not much else to say, it's just an amazingly good restaurant with good service."}
{"text":"Awful service, great food.

Those words basically sum up this place. Because of the food, black dogs is always packed. You don't want to eat in usually because the service is non-existent. They will give u the food and never come back. 

I actually had a waitress that was eating in the back, but we were done eating and wanted the check. After calling her up, she had to take another bite and casually take her time giving us dirty checks. It is unacceptable!

After having a great meal, the terrible service just ruined it.

So I should probably give 2 scores.

Service: 0/5
Food: 5/5

I recommend take out only."}
{"text":"I just wish this places wasn't so packed all of the time, but with food as good as this, what do you expect. I have only tried a few sauces (Carolina and Georgia Peach) and they are awesome. I get the wings every time I come here. I have tried the pulled pork, catfish sandwich and even a burger. The food is always great. I just really wish I could sit down and enjoy lunch here without a ridiculously long wait."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious barbecue. I didn't even know that I liked barbecue until I ate at Black Dog for the first time. I recommend any of the sandwiches, and the spicy southwest potato salad is SPICY and wonderful. The corn bread is dense and buttery with pieces of pulled pork inside; very filling and rich and tasty.

You will almost always have to wait for a table at this restaurant because the space is so small. I've heard that ordering take-out works really well to cut down the waiting time before you get to eat, but I haven't tried it yet. The waitstaff are always friendly, though sometimes a little frazzled from the huge numbers of customers coming through for the amazing food."}
{"text":"The only problem with Black Dog is that they are always packed!  But that is because they are SSSOOOOOOOOO GGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!!!

Believe me it is worth the wait.  Best BBQ in town, and in Illinois (as far as I know).  Get the corn bread, it is something else."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, great beer, and awesome prices.  Not much else to say!"}
{"text":"The new Champaign location is AMAZING! They did such great job at bringing the authenticity of the Urbana location to downtown Champaign. Service and food is always top notch. I have not tried the mac and cheese at this location yet, but I am sure it is the same as the Urbana location and that is why I gave only 4 stars. It is just mediocre. Get the other sides over the mac and cheese, which is very sad for me to say because I LOVE mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite places in grad school, hands down.  Each of my friends groups loved this place and it's great for takeout so I must have been here over 30 times in two years.  And now that I've moved to a region with crappy BBQ, I dream of Black Dog's brisket and wonder why I moved here. Job, schmob.

I've been coming here ever since the first week they opened and they've really come a long way.  The food was always delicious, but they ironed out the kinks and expanded the menu. Everything is delicious.  You really can't go wrong.

The ribs, brisket and pulled pork are AMAZING.  The brisket is my favorite, hands down. I've had brisket at other places and it's dry or fatty or lacking in flavor. Not Black Dog. I've never had bad brisket here. I've never had bad ANYTHING here.

The sides are just stunning.  I had a recurring problem with underdone smoked sweet potatoes but no one else had this problem. I must be cursed. When they're fully done, they're delicious, just check them before you leave if you get takeout.  The fries and sweet potato fries are crisp and delicious. In about 20 orders, we've never had soggy or greasy fries.  The potato casserole is okay but it's a bit bland.  Their homemade smoked bleu cheese dressing  is also fabulous.  And I'd consider composing an ode to their cornbread.

They also did theme nights, where they'd put on special dinners.  There was a night with local meats from Triple S Farms, a beer night, and a Thanksgiving dinner.  All delicious. Notice a theme, here?  I miss you guys!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Champaign-Urbana area. Seriously this barbecue is as good as it gets. Lines can be long but if you go on the \"off hours\" in between meal times, the lines aren't long at all. Best thing I like to get is the carolina and texas burgers. Probably the best burger i've ever had! so yummy. I just love the barbecue sauce they use! It's so delicious! I bring all my friends and family here when they visit =]"}
{"text":"I've been here a hand full of times.  I've taken later-impressed friends here.  I've went here with parents.  It's great for every occasion.  Besides their selection of succulent meats (the burnt ends are the best but go fast), the sides are great.  That's where I think they separate themselves with other bbq joints.  The twice baked potato casserole are corn bread are amazing!!"}
{"text":"The BEST burnt ends and brisket I've had in a while. Super tender meat and really friendly and attentive waiters. Loved everything about this place (except for the hour long wait)."}
{"text":"This is it, the premier place for food in C-U.  If you don't visit it while in town and care about what you eat you definitely missed out.  A constantly changing draft list and new specials every day give you options other than the 5 star BBQ.  The only thing to be warned about is because of the size you will have to wait, i'd go at odd times.  Georgia Peach sauce on everything."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come here last week and it's a pleasant surprise. There's no wait if you choose to sit at the bar, which is a significant improvement compared to the Urbana location. Ordered brunt ends and beef ribs. Brunt ends were simply too brunt, not as juicy as the ones I had long ago at the Urbana Black Dog. However, the beef ribs are heaven, just the right amount of favor, fat and tenderness. It's so good that I had to order it again for takeout 2 days later."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I've had here has been awesome. The cornbread, BBQ, I've even had the Cuban which was good. 

The service has always been passable. This is after all a bar, and I'd rather have my servers be brief and move people and food than have to wait in a line for 45 min because they took their time and were super chatty (as opposed to the 45 min wait because the food is great)."}
{"text":"The Black Dog has amazing Burnt Ends, a must try! But get there early, they sell out fast and the wait to be seated can be long. Be sure to sign your name on the butcher paper to be seated. The BBQ is good and the portions are big! The twice baked potatoes were delicious."}
{"text":"A fantastic place in Urbana! I currently live in Tennessee, and this is at least as good as anything we have here in the South -- and the atmosphere is better. Try the Hot Georgia Peach sauce if you like it spicy. The black tips are fabulous, and if you like English style (dry) cider, wash it down with a Crispin cider. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My searching is over!  Hands down best BBQ in the whole C-U area!  Prices are EXTREMELY low and food is exceptional!  My friends and I visit this place embarrassingly often.

Only cons: Very small and most people leave after seeing the line of people waiting to be seated.  I don't think there is ever not a line.  HOWEVER, it is very worth it, they do their best to sit you in a timely fashion and once you start eating you will forget that you waited.  Sadly, because it is very crowded the staff seems to get a bit irritated (for good reason) so if you want great service I wouldn't go at the end of a lunch/dinner rush.  Again, I'm all about the food so as long as they bring it to me I don't really care. 

Try it.  I have never had anything bad.  Wait in line and you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what else there is to say about Black Dog that hasn't already been said.

It's the best barbecue in Central Illinois. It has an excellent whiskey selection and always carries a few good draft beers (that are usually different from the beers on tap at other bars in town).

The place is small and at peak hours the wait approaches absurdity.

Eat the burnt ends. Eat the corn bread.

And I'm not sure I'm supposed to tell you this, but if you are a spicy food lover, they have an off-menu Ghost Pepper sauce that will wreck you. And I mean what I say. Wrecked. They should make you sign a waiver to even serve you the stuff.

Just go. But if you're smart, get hungry between 2-5pm. Or be there before they open."}
{"text":"No wait time on a Saturday night! Drinks never went dry. Food was great as always only took about 10 minutes to get it. New place is nice, Clean bathrooms with Dyson hand dryer sanitizer is nice."}
{"text":"Uhh-mazing food! Cool atmosphere. Great staff. A little bit of a wait but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I can't claim to be an expert on barbecue, and I'm biased for my hometown location, but I've never had anything as good as the meals I've gotten at Black Dog. Every review is going to tell you about the amazing burnt ends or brisket or pulled pork, and they're not wrong, but don't sleep on the side dishes.

The sides at Black Dog are out of this world. The best is surely the cornbread, which actually has barbecue meat in it; the taste is indescribable. The twice-baked potato casserole is also a favorite, with its crispy edges being the best part. The southwest potato salad, pit beans, and smoked sweet potato are also amazing and should be tried, if possible. Really, there's no way to have a bad meal here unless you're a vegan."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times with success. I enjoy pretty much everything I've tried here, from the cornbread to the rib tips. This recent visit I've had (on 4/6),  however, leaves me a bit concerned about the consistency of service. 

I bring a friend so he can experience his first time, and we went after the usual lunch rush. After the initial wait for a table, we were seated, and the server seemed pleasant enough. I did notice she was the only one, though. 

The problem came with the spaciness of service. After our orders arrived, she asked if everything looked okay, and we didn't see her again until the bill came. I asked for a certain sauce with my order, and didn't get it, so I asked for a take home container of the correct one with my leftovers. She went into defensive mode, initially telling me she'd have to charge me for the replacement with comebacks such as \"Well, if I wrote it on the ticket, you got the right one.\" After I informed her that it wasn't, telling her this was a spicier sauce, then she decided my complaint was valid. When dropping off my box and sauce she seemed to throw it on the table and keep going, no apologies or anything. 

I'm willing to give this place the benefit of a doubt because I normally come in here and get much better service. I'm not sure if this particular server was new or just flustered, but I didn't appreciate the back and forth when her earlier attentiveness would have better remedied this situation. Maybe I'll think about calling in next time, if there is a next time."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in C-U, in my opinion.  Not too expensive, either, given the quality of the BBQ you're getting.  I haven't had anything that wasn't good there, so you really can't go wrong.  Beer selection is excellent as well, which is a nice bonus.

That said, the quality is a little variable.  Some nights it's just good but then other nights it's drop dead amazing.  On top of that, it's impossible on virtually any night of the week so get there early (5:30 or so) or expect to wait a long time.  It's still worth it and you can't begrudge them their success, they deserve.

Always ask if they still have burnt ends... and I vastly prefer their hot Georgia Peach sauce to the standard sauce."}
{"text":"Best bbq in champaign Urbana area. A long line. I love ribs and burger. Bun ends are great."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Black Dog a few times now and have tried a number of things off their menu.  Among the choices, one of my favorites is the pulled pork sandwich with their signature sauce.  The pork has plenty of smoky flavor but it is not overwhelming while the sauce has a slight tang and complements the meat well.  I recently tried the pulled chicken sandwich and found it was just as good if not better than the pork.  Outside of main entrees, the sweet potato fries are fantastic as is the corn bread.  One thing to note about the sandwiches is that they all come with cole slaw on top unless you specifically ask otherwise.

As others have noted, there is not a lot of seating in the restaurant and if you happen to visit during a busy time you may end up waiting for a while.  Also, given the tight quarters, there isn't much standing room while waiting so things can get cramped rather quickly.  If you want to try Black Dog's food without waiting for a seat, they do offer carry out which is extremely quick."}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've had. Burnt ends are delicious. The chicken is juicy and slightly pink-perfectly cooked! The beer selection is amazing. There was a 15 or 20 minute wait, due to the deserving popularity of the place. While its not a cheap place, for the quality of food the value is outstanding."}
{"text":"Good food.  Best in the area for BBQ.  Really long wait and not the best service.  I wouldn't mind but when its cold there is no space for those waiting. Got yelled at for trying to get a drink from the bar while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This is a smallish place.  We arrived for a late weekend lunch and waited about 20 minutes for a table.  The restaurant is long and narrow. At the front is an area with a few high-top tables. There is a long bar with several bar stools.  Against the wall and opposite the bar are booths.

The menu includes a variety of bottled and draft craft beers. We enjoyed a wheat beer while we waited for our table.  The menu is devoted to barbecue.  Our starters included cornbread (very different from what I've tried in the past as it included peppers) and smoked wings accompanied by a North Carolina sauce and a blue-cheese dip on the side.  We ordered sandwiches, all of which were uniformly excellent (a pulled-pork sandwich, a brisket sandwich and a pulled chicken sandwich). They were accompanied by a North Carolina sauce  (you can request another sauce) and side dishes. The baked potato casserole was something like a twice-baked potato minus the potato skin and was also very good.  

The food was so good we didn't mind the wait at all."}
{"text":"We visited Black Dog tonight for the first time and now have a new favorite BBQ restaurant.  My husband got the rib tips and I had burnt ends and pulled pork.  They were all amazing.  We also had the cornbread...so, so good.  I had potato salad and pit beans for my sides and the smoke flavor of the beans was seriously out of this world.  I really could imagine myself sitting out at my grandma's farm during our yearly family cookout, which might sound cheesy but it was that good.  We both had the house sauce, which was good but I will probably try something a bit milder next time.  The staff was VERY friendly.  I felt like I was just hanging out with my friends at a bar that happened to have incredible BBQ too.  Everything was outstanding and although we got there early enough that we didn't have to wait, we would have been more than happy to."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I payed for a drink and the person who took the order just forgot about it and served several other people and I had to ask another worker to get my drink. 

Waited 14 teams before it was my party's turn to get seated but didn't get served because one of the member of the party ordered food for togo. I explained each members were intending to order food and will not eat the togo food while in the restaurant. However, we were not served and left after receiving the togo items the one member ordered. Regret leaving tip for the drink."}
{"text":"Service was really good, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. It was very crowded, people were waiting and standing at my table it was very uncomfortable. Great service though!"}
{"text":"Update:  Ok, I had dinner at the Black Dog.  The ribs were to die for, the beer selection makes me feel like I've gone to brew heaven, and the service was good.  Now only if they were open on Sundays...



This place pretty much does what it needs to!

Great beer selection, \"real\" lemonaide, awesome meat, ok service.  I didn't have a single complaint!

It beats the pants off of the other bbq places in town for taste and offerings. 

Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in C-U.  When I come back to town, I make a stop here more times than not.  The wait can be long, but I can't give Black Dog less than 5 stars.  The BBQ is all superb, and the pit beans, sweet potato fries, and baked potato casserole are my favorite sides.  Never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue.  I had the three combo platter with ribs, brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork was put of which world, ribs were good too but the brisket is worth a skip- nothing to write home about. Definitely get the corn bread and beans - both were divine! Great value for money but be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"The \"Burnt Ends\" sandwich is the finest barbecue I have ever had north of the Mason-Dixon line. This is coming from someone who regularly visits Georgia and the Carolinas! Yee haw!"}
{"text":"Ahh, the bi-fecta... Southern style BBQ + Midwestern beers. I've swapped out the usual pulled pork for some burnt ends, when I can get my hands on them (early lunch!).. brisket's tasty too (sliced and super tender). Only one request: whip up this girl some mustard sauce!"}
{"text":"I went here with my colleague last night. The parking lot was a little bit hard to find, which was kinda normal for downtown Champaign. The waiting time was quite OK if you agreed to seat at the bar. The menu was easy to understand and the waitress was helpful for suggestions. I ordered the two platters and so did my friend. The organic chicken was so so so good! Highly recommended! It was juicy, tasty, and falling of the bones easily. The pork rib was too dry, frankly to say. The peach bbq sauce was delicious for both chicken and pork. The waiter kept refilling the home brewed sweet tea. 
I should give four stars, but the waiter messed up with my bill. I ended up to pay all the drinks we ordered, including my friends. I don't mind to do that, but not prefer to do because of mistakes."}
{"text":"They grab a 3.5 rating.

Great brisket & pulled pork with a nice sauce selection.
Powerful draft list.
Great service.  They really know their stuff here and are happy to walk you through with samples."}
{"text":"We ate here last night, I read about this place on the web, and I was hopeful. From the outside you would never think that good food was coming out of the kitchen, but as they say, \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" 
 We started out with the wing appetizer, they were great. The wings were smoked, and tossed in an amazing sauce, wish their were more on the plate than six. Then I went with the brisket sandwich, it was tender and delicious, for my side was the twice baked potato casserole which I really found to be something special. My wife went with the pulled pork which was superior to any I have found in the area. We also ordered a sampler plate of their sauces, they have seven different sauces varying in sweetness and heat, they are all unique and really nice. Overall the food there that we had was fantastic.
     I really wish this place was in a bigger building, it's tiny. We stood in a small mob at the front door waiting to be seated for about 25 minutes. Though it was worth the wait for the great food, I did see many people open the door, see the crowd and leave. We ended up getting stuck at the bar to eat our meal, which wasn't preferable, but beggars can't be choosers. 
    Overall, I was super pleased with this place because of the awesome food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go eat here now and order delicious meat and all of the sides. The pulled pork is incredibly tender and the cole slaw, corn bread, and sweet potato fries were the perfect accompaniments. I definitely didn't intend on eating as much as I did but I just couldn't stop myself.

I was recommended to try Black Dog by former U of I students and I will definitely be returning when I'm traveling to Champaign for work."}
{"text":"Exceptional bbq.  I love the pork ribs and now the salmon. Hard to get a seat, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing barbeque. Like most people, I love the burnt ends. The blue cheese burger is also amazing. The Texas caviar is a favorite side. They are one of the few places in town with absinthe behind the bar (Seven Saints is the only other one I'm aware of), and they make a delicious sazerac cocktail. The staff is nice. Steve up front can seem a little on the serious side, but I would be too if I was trying to manage the crowd of people who pack in that little area."}
{"text":"I had the dinner salad with pork, and it was terrible.  For $8.95 you get a small amount of lettuce, an equal amount of red onion, and a small portion of meat.  And, one small dressing.  Oh yes, and the tomatoes. . . they brag about locally sourced lettuce, but then put on roma tomatoes with no flavor and obviously from a large food service company.  The local tomatoes now are so awesome--if you're so plugged into local, why not use them?  Also, every time I come here the service is indifferent at best.  I also feel like they don't want me there. LIke I owe them something since they are so popular.  I hope the other BBQ places start using more sustainable meat, and I will go there instead of this place, where I have to wait an hour no matter what time of the day to have the honor of them serving me!"}
{"text":"You will see a line, possibly overflowing outside of the door.  It is there for a reason.  Find the gentleman or the lady taking the names for the queue and just wait... patiently...  Black Dog's food is a privilege rewarded only to the most patient and determined.   Take a note of the daily lunch and dinner specials.  Some of those are really unique.  If they haven't run out of the burnt ends, get that.  Otherwise close your eyes and randomly point at something on the menu.  Doesn't matter really because everything is top notch.  If you are hungry, get the corn bread appetizer as well.  As far as the sides go, the casserole is a crowd favorite.  I also like the pit beans and the sweet potato fries.  If your item has bbq sauce, note that you have some options besides the house one, all of them offering a different flavor experience.  This place deserves 6 stars and then some."}
{"text":"We arrived right at 11 when they opened, we had 7 in our party and there were two 4 top tables in the front open. However, instead of splitting the party or asking if we wanted to split we were told to wait while two parties that arrived after us were sat at the two tables, and we had to wait for them to eat to eventually be sat split and sat at the other two four top tables in the front. The lack of common sense was disappointing especially since there was no way we would be able to stuff our entire group into any of the tables since were the booths are no bigger than the four tops in the front

I'm a vegetarian and only came for the meat eaters in the group. The waiter did help be find the meat free options on the menu, but there was nothing that exciting."}
{"text":"I would give the wings a five star, because honestly they were the BEST I have ever had.  As far as the actual BBQ, it's good, but not amazing.  It was a bit fatty for my taste, so I'll give it a four star. I am from the South, and I have had some AMAZING BBQ down there.  Get the wings, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is prompt and polite. The food is great. The brisket and pulled pork were tender and the succotash was a great accompaniment to the food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. It's not perfect, but if I had let myself, I probably could've eaten there every week. The downside is that it is small. Small to the point where I would do ridiculous things and tell my group of friends \"everyone get there at 10:45am\". Oh, and your entire party has to be there if you want to be seated. 

But the bbq. Fantastic. Get the burnt ends if they aren't out for the day (they run out on those early). They also tend to have an interesting beer selection. Sides are good, too. My bbq of choice was the hot Georgia Peach. Personal favorite combination was the burnt ends sandwich with hot Georgia Peach sauce and sweet potato fries on the side. The cornbread is good, too (it does have meat in it though)."}
{"text":"There are a few times in life where you think to yourself, \"if I could just find a hole in a wall and cover myself with some scary deliciously barbecued meats, that'd be great.\" Black Dog is totally that place. I also like that I can get a beer while I wait for a spot. Thanks Black Dog. You rule."}
{"text":"This is the best place I have ever eaten. The prices are really not bad, the food is amazing, the service was amazing. No hovering just fast and as needed. We got the BBQ sauce flight, which all together is a bottles worth of barbeque sauce, and they give you lids to take them home. I could talk about this place for hours, if you enjoy meats, you will love it."}
{"text":"The Good:
- All of their food is good! I have never tried anything from here that I did not like! Their burnt ends and free range chicken are both very good, and their fries are delicious!
- The atmosphere is fun and relaxed, perfect for lunch or dinner.

The Bad:
- The wait can be pretty bad sometimes, especially if you come in at prime times for lunch or dinner. 
- It's a small place, which can make waiting for a table likely to induce some claustrophobia. 

Overall:
- It's an excellent place for barbecue. I've been here at least five or six times, and have taken family here as well. And I don't even typically enjoy barbecue!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic bbq stop,  the burnt ends were insane,  I loved them,  you cant go wrong  here with the protien choices. Solid sides,  our server was very unique and entertaining and on point with recommendations."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. True slow smoked BBQ and good craft beer to boot. Get the burnt ends if they haven't sold out. They're very popular and disappear fast."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Black Dog is the bomb! Delicious food, awesome staff, great atmosphere. What more can you ask for? We go anytime we can. The wait kind of sucks, but that just shows you that it's good. Easy 5!"}
{"text":"the WEIRD thing about this place is that you only get to order 1 sauce, maybe two if you get a combo plate. WTF!? the best part about a bbq experience is trying a variety of sauces. but okay...

the three stars rating is partially our fault as we arrived around 2pm and they had sold out of burnt ends AND the pulled pork, so i can't comment on those items. 

I am a brisket lover, but this brisket was just, meh. it was toooo lean, and lacked any real flavor derived from the fat, and smoke flavor was non-existant. Seriously just tasted like eating a beef roast. i cannot recommend ordering it. i wasn't too thrilled with the sweet potato fries, but they were fine.

husband ordered the ribs, which i might add, were great! and i don't normally like ribs, but these are for sure worth ordering. Husband also liked his baked sweet potato too. 

the BEST part of the meal though, was the smoked chicken salad appetizer with crackers. wow! we loved that and highly recommend for something different. 

i feel bad leaving three stars - but i will give it another chance if i'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I think your experience of the Black Dog's atmosphere is largely contingent upon what sorts of restaurants you've been to in the past and how you expect to be treated by the people who are serving you/cooking you food for the evening. 

If you tend to go out to restaurants like, say, Chili's or Friday's, where the servers are obligated to be saccharine to the point of nausea, then hey! you probably won't like The Black Dog's atmosphere because you'll think the servers, host or bartenders are rude for not falling all over themselves to do your bidding. 

I personally love the Black Dog, primarily for the food. If I had one complaint about the place it would be that it gets pretty cramped. Probably once a week I entertain the notion of going to eat here and have to decide against it because of how ridiculously busy it is. I know The Black Dog isn't hurting for business and I might even be doing them a favor by not going to dine with them on their busier evenings, but GOD, I love them so much. Why do you constantly rebuff my advances, Black Dog?

The Black Dog is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I've loved everything I've tried on the menu thus far.  The portions are always more than enough, and the food is, frankly, under-priced for the amount and quality of food you get. The first time I went I expected to pay $15 an entree and was shocked to find it was far cheaper. Pay this place a visit, even if you have to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Worth it."}
{"text":"Went back after four years of boycotting due to hair in lemonade. Skipped the drink and got a sandwich to go w  fries. Tipped 20 percent for takeout order. Get back to office- they didn't give me my sauce or ketchup for fries. So check your meal before you leave the joint."}
{"text":"I don't normally review BBQ joints unless I've tried the ribs. I'm making an exception for Black Dog for one reason: the burnt ends. I'm a burnt ends fanatic, it's my absolute favorite food & I make occasional trips to Kansas City just to eat burnt ends. However, I'd never had good burnt ends outside of KC. Even otherwise world class bbq joints outside of KC would always have lackluster burnt ends. Then one Sunday, I walked into Black Dog & ordered them, fairly skeptical of how good they'd be. Then I took a bite. And had my mind blown. And my faith in humanity restored. They were amazing, we're talking a 9.95 out of 10. My only regret is that I didn't order a pound of burnt ends."}
{"text":"A group of four of us visiting the U of IL did some light research and chose Black Dog for dinner.  Another colleague who was local to the area told us that Urbana was \"dead\" and we should go somewhere else.  We ignored the advice and boy were we glad we did!
It was a Monday about 6pm and we had roughly a 5 minute wait.  The guy who seated us was a little surly but we didn't have to interact with him much.  Our server however, was great fun.  
We had the beer flight which was great and then each of us had a sandwich - 2 pulled pork and 2 burnt ends - and then the sweet potato fries.  Sandwiches came with sauce and coleslaw on the sandwich and they were phenomenal.  Price was amazingly low and terrific value for the dollar."}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever. The variety of sauces really sets this place apart. Not to mention their sides, especially the twice baked potato casserole, are some of the best I've had at."}
{"text":"My favorite Champaign-Urbana restaurant!  I've had lots of great barbecue but nothing holds a candle to my Black Dog.  Really great atmosphere, good selection of craft beer, and good lord, the food.  Count on waiting 15-20 minutes for a table, but it will be so worth your wait!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I go crazy whenever I see NC-style barbecue (see hometown).

Went here on friday with some friends, it was small and packed but we only had to wait by the door 5-10 min.  Sat at the bar and got the beer menu, they have a fantastic selection of really good beer for cheaper prices than you'd find at any other bar.  Then it was a choice between the ribs, half chicken, catfish, and pulled pork (pulled pork !!!).  I had to get the ribs, which were dry rubbed, smoked, and came with the perfect vinegar-y sauce.  The sides are just as delicious, one of my friends fell so in love with his baked beans that he's been talking about them for the past two days.  

Looks like they also do breakfast/brunch, that'll be next on my list to try."}
{"text":"The best BBQ this side of the Mississippi... I'm not kidding, this stuff is amazing!

Black Dog uses local farms in the majority of their meal production, and it definitely shows!  The food is fresh, reasonably priced, and finger lickin good, and comes complete with wet naps.

Would have received 5 stars if not for the service... From start to finish, it's lackluster, at best.  The gentleman host seems checked out and by your presence, and the hipster staff follows suit.  At times, you feel as though you have to apologize for requiring them to do their job.  Not to mention that they're trying to push you out the door the minute you receive your entree. There are some exceptions to this (funny, tall hippy guy with great sense of humor, awesome short-haired lady cook, bald, heavily bearded bartender), but the more than few bad apples leave an unfortunate bad taste in your mouth.

If you can get past the service and long waits, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"As a person who went vegetarian for a year, you could say I'm picky about the meat I eat. The fact that Black Dog is one of my all-time favorite restaurants to grab a meal says a lot then, because almost every meal offered here consists of meat (it is a barbecue place, after all). My personal favorite is the burnt ends. It's moist, it's flavorful, it tastes absolutely amazing with their Texas barbecue sauce. It can be eaten on its own or in between a bun. However, a warning: the burnt ends go quick. Sadly, Black Dog only offers a limited amount of each meat per day, and the burnt ends run out faster than any other meat they serve. 

Their pulled pork is also quite good, and the sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had. The portobello mushroom sandwich, however, is slightly disappointing, but this IS a barbecue place. The beef brisket also wasn't my favorite since I found it a little dry/overdone. Otherwise, though, this is one of my favorite restaurants.

Bring your family, bring your friends. This is a great place to hang out and have a casual but tasty meal. And, extra bonus: they serve craft beers too."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!!!! Hopefully they will expand their dining area because it's cramped. I'm not a fan of their cold slaw and their prices are kind of steep, but it's worth it. I love the Georgia peach barbecue sauce. And don't get me started on their delicious fries."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a meat eater, but Black Dog could change my mind.  Their barbecue is just succulent.  I am partial to the burnt ends sandwich with a side of their zippy potato salad.  Their garden salads are good too and made with local artisan greens. Beer aficiandos will find a wide selection....order the flight of 6 samples to find what you like best.  

Two caveats:  the wait for a seat can be very long and there's usually congestion at the front door.  They need a space three times bigger than what they have now.  Also, don't ever try to order vegetarian stuff.  There's hardly any on the menu, and what I've tried isn't impressive.  But who goes to Black Dog to be a vegetarian, anyway!"}
{"text":"Burnt ends and rib tips are to crave for! Go early to queue. Their cornbread has some pulled pork inside and it tastes nice!"}
{"text":"I was highly encouraged to visit this place as one of the best places for ribs. To be frank, the  platter concept was interesting and the potato casserol was amazing. Was dissapointed they were all out of burnt ends. Was looking forward to those too. I would suggest it as a joint for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Tried this place on our way through town based on the reviews. Our first server was great, then they had shift change and rather than our server staying with us, they gave us someone new. A little strange, would prefer to have stuck with the original girl all the way through our meal. 

We tried the cornbread appetizer since they were out of burnt ends, and it was great! Would definitely order that again. Also had a drunken hippie beer, which was pretty good. For entrees we tried the two meat platter and the smoked turkey club. The meats and the club sandwich were all fantastic. The sides were meh. Southwest potato salad was good, super spicy though. The mac n cheese, which I was really excited about, was disappointing. The roux they used had so much flour in it, the sauce ended up pretty grainy and somewhat flavorless. The potato casserole was also pretty bland. 

That being said, we would still come back to try additional menu items. Will just have to remember to come earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Great place if you're a fan of smoked meats.  Not only is it top notch quality.  But the sides are also amazing.  They offer different specials every day.  They don't compromise on quality.   Be sure to time your visit during their less busy times and bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"The Rib Tips are the best! It couldn't get any better"}
{"text":"Black Dog is a new favorite. I've had their chicken, pork, and brisket sandwiches plus their catfish. Pulled pork is my favorite sandwich. Love the Carolina sauce and the crunch from the slaw is outstanding. And you can't beat the burnt ends. They literally melt in your mouth. Sweet potato fries are a solid side but pit beans are the best. Great selection of beers. This is not a very big place and I regularly have to wait for a table, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"A busy Sunday afternoon. The smell when you walk in was quite mouth-watering. Our group was seated faster than expected which we liked. Texas caviar was yummy and impressed the skeptical. We ordered a few burgers, chicken and ribs. All pretty tasty. Ribs could have cooked a little longer for the white bone to soften up and cook a little more of the fat off. Burgers and chicken were excellent. Texas BBQ and Ga peach sauces were also excellent. Mac and cheese had a grainy texture to it. Twice baked potato and pit bean sides were good. Definitely a place we will visit again."}
{"text":"Just go! Even if there's a wait, it is the best BBQ place in town. I highly recommend the chipotle smoked wings."}
{"text":"They make good beef here. Christ almighty. Get the Hot Georgia Peach Sauce. Get it.

The Cuban on Wednesdays is out-friggin-standing. I am quite the Cuban aficionado and this is a sterling example. Panini-style, I think. Angels dance in heaven when they begin preparing the Cubans on Wednesday mornings."}
{"text":"Personally I really didn't care for this place. Everyone was telling my how amazing it is and i just didn't taste it. I think they had way to many bbq sauces. Some people like that, but i think you know it is going to be a good bbq place, when the place has one famous sauce. One thing i loved on that menu was the twice backed casserole. It was so good. As for the bbq itself, i wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Best place in Champaign-Urbana to sit down, relax, and enjoy a great meal. Food is top-notch. I've tried the pulled pork, the ribs, the catfish, and their shrimp po' boy and will vouch for them all personally. The cornbread is moist and has some fun little bits of meat and beans in. I like to order the fries and slaw as sides -- people always come for the barbecue (and rightly so), but I think their fries are also the best in town. On top of everything, the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and laid-back. A must-visit if you are in the area, and worth the wait that you will almost certainly endure (even in the bitter cold of an Illinois winter).

One note: they've recently switched their default sauce from the somewhat-spicy Carolina Red to a milder, liquid sauce. I have no complaints about the new one, but I prefer the Carolina Red, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious to near-fatal aversion to spicy food."}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite restaurant in Urbana/Champaign! I've heard they have a second location in the works...I'm hoping it has a larger dining area. As it stands now, expect a wait...but know that it is VERY much worth it!"}
{"text":"Ever wonder why at some restaurants the food tastes \"Amazing\"???  Sadly, this migraine sufferer can attest that it is Always because the food contains MSG and/or Natural Flavoring.  I loved the food here but have gotten an MSG related migraine Every Time so no longer go.  Lucky for most people this sensitivity is not a problem."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've ever had, the best smoked meat I've ever had, the best sauces I've ever had. This place has it all! 
It's inexpensive, everything is delicious and has a monthly rotation of great beer (at a good price).

Bit of advice: get there early, it's always packed."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to the Black Dog. We had the rib platter with two sides. The ribs were extremely tasty and tender but a little light on the meat side. The twice baked potatoes were outstanding and sweet potato fries were also very tasty. We also had a side of the chicken wings. They were the very very best wings, perfectly done tender and just the right spice. With the sauces that come are not required on the meats. The sauces add a lot of extra flavor. I will definitely be back here in another month when I return."}
{"text":"I'm a mostly-veggie eater, and I love this place. Their portabello sandwich is among the best I've ever had -- apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully. The catfish is also delicious. Love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and, if it's summer, the smoked sweet corn. Yum! As most everyone else has said, the meats are also delicious -- according to my husband and the tons of people we've brought here for lunch or dinner.

Their tap list is relatively small -- they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time -- but there's always lovely choices. Recently, there's been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin / apple fall beers! Bar and food service sometimes seems rushed, but surprisingly good for how busy they get.

This place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours (30-min wait at 8.30pm on a Wednesday?), but it has still become our default for out-of-town guests. That says a whole heck of a lot."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for great BBQ, so every time I visit Urbana I'm drawn to Black Dog like a moth to a savory, melt in your mouth, slow smoked meaty flame.  Get there early before they '86' burnt ends.  Good BBQ doesn't need sauces, so I don't need it here, but they do have a really great assortment of sauces of varying heat and style for the less sophisticated to try.  The sides and appetizers are excellent as well.  I go to the original downtown location for nostalgia, but there is a new site in Champaign."}
{"text":"I have been in Urbana-Champaign for four years now and  I cannot believe I have only just discovered this place last month. My boyfriend and I fell in love with this place the first time around, and we returned there to celebrate my birthday earlier this week.

Food---much of the food I've had so far have been awesome. I believe their Burnt Ends are the most popular on the menu and they might run out of it by mid-evening during very busy days. My boyfriend's favorite is the chicken, mine pulled pork. The artichoke dip for appetizer was HEAVEN. I recommend getting sweet potato fries as your choice of side, although the potato casserole is also very good! I haven't tried the coleslaw, but I have heard it is also a solid choice. I also love eating their cornbread. Make sure to look at their specials for the day around the end of the food menu. Those can also give good options for appetizers or food that the table can share. The only disappointment so far that I have experienced food-wise were when we ordered Dragon Skewers; they sounded really good--peppers wrapped in bacon and some sort of (cheesy?) sauce--but it turned out TOO spicy to taste anything else, plus it was actually just 1 skewer with 3 of those bacon-wrapped peppers for something like five bucks.

Drinks---since the food portions at Black Dog are big and the barbecued meats are obviously very filling, I have not yet decided to order any other drinks besides water. They have however a wide variety of options for beer, and my boyfriend have enjoyed the drinks he has gotten so far.

Availability---the venue is pretty small, so there is often a line by the entrance for people waiting to get a table. I don't think they let you make reservations, and they WILL NOT seat you until everyone in your party has arrived. So if you are with a group of people, it would be better that you all get there at the same time, or have someone go there ahead of everyone to get your party on the list (that way, it would be possible that you are up next to be seated as soon as as the last person has arrived.)

Service---food comes quickly and despite the usually packed place, servers have not yet failed to refill our drinks as needed.

Atmosphere---sports bar-like. Loud with several big-screen TVs playing sports games. But so far it has not bee so obnoxiously loud that you can't have a decent conversation at a normal decibel if you want. And you see families and elderly people there, too, not just college-aged students.

If you are living, visiting, or even just passing through Champaign, do yourself a favor and eat at Black Dog. Seriously. (Unless you're a vegetarian...)"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the area, and a good selection of craft beers on tap.  The barbecue style is dry-rub which allows you to really taste the meats, rather than everything being covered in sauce.

Everything is good, but the pulled pork, ribs, and chicken wings are my favorites.  Also, try the corn bread. The bits of meat and peppers in the bread surprised me, but now it's the only cornbread I eat!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is a superb barbecue place! My bf and I went for the 5th time the other night and although they seemed to short us on the Burnt End appetizer, the meal was delicious as always!!! :) I'll come back for more"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem! Just get the burnt ends! Would have given 5 star but could have used more food. Don't be afraid to get 3 meat combo, you can easily eat it! They replenish the burnt ends at 5 PM"}
{"text":"My SO and I shared a 3 meat platter and it was the perfect size. The brisket, ribs, and salmon were all incredible. Beautiful smokey aromas on the meat but nothing over-smoked. The twice baked potato salad blew my mind. It is a perfect side for BBQ. They have a wonderful, changing beer menu with options you won't find many places. I had a Pepper infused Oatmeal Stout that was killer and my GF had a Ruby-red grapefruit cocktail that was very refreshing. 

Couldn't say enough good things about our experience at Black Dog tonight. We'll be going back. 

TIP: Plan to wait 30 minutes. There is a bar right behind Black Dog,  Bunny's Tavern."}
{"text":"A lot of my reviews lately have been negative.  Have I just become too picky?  Are my standards too high?

When I start wondering that, it's time to go to Black Dog.  

This place is amazing.  I've been there many times, with many people.  Virtually everyone has been impressed.  The sauces are good, the meat is wonderful, and the specials are interesting.  

If you are a beer fan (I am) they consistently have interesting beer in a variety of styles.  The taps rotate very frequently, so it's almost always a different set of choices when you go.  They also get some limited release stuff, like cask-aged beers.  It's awesome.  

I'm not as much a cocktail drinker, but they also have their own infused liquors and cocktails made with them.  

I think the sandwiches are the best deal, and they are consistently great.  Tender pulled pork, the always-in-demand and frequently out of stock burnt ends, and delicious brisket.  You can also get the meat on top of a burger for a decadent and delicious treat.  And the sides are all good too!  Potato salad with actual flavor instead of just mayonnaise!  The best sweet potato fries I've ever had!  

The platters seem like you maybe get a bit less food per dollar, but they're still good.  I still have to give the nod to Lil Porgies for ribs, overall, but Black Dog is king for sandwiches.

Specials include things like smoked salmon, muffaleta sandwiches, and burritos or tacos.  

They've had a couple charity nights with homemade ramen.  If you see one of  these and you like ramen at all - go.  This is the closest to real Japanese ramen I've had, with awesome barbecue twists like a hard boiled egg that's been smoked and is still, somehow, gooey in the middle.  Absolutely wonderful.

The downside?  Black Dog is so good there's often a line.  It's not a huge place.  It wouldn't be good at all for a group of more than 6 people.  And waits of 30 minutes or more are not uncommon.  Don't be surprised by that - this isn't the place to go for a quick bite.  (Though they do offer take-out.)   

Overall?  Black Dog is really, really good.  It makes you feel good to eat here.  If you like barbecue at all - especially Carolina style - you should go here.  Yes, there will probably be a wait - because the secret's out."}
{"text":"Broke a tooth on the bones left in a pulled pork sandwich. Expensive experience! Not going back!"}
{"text":"There is a reason there is so much hype on here about this place - because it is wonderful!  I had the catfish sandwich and my husband had the burnt ends.  Both were so amazing we barely talked the entire meal.  The couple next to us ordered the ribs and they looked incredible - so much meat!  Our friends went and said the pulled pork  and sweet potato fries are great.  We'd love to try everything on their menu eventually :)"}
{"text":"There is no doubt that the food is great here. I enjoyed the pulled pork and ribs here. The sides were good too, and I liked the ambiance. If you are in town, you should definitely stop by black dog for quality meat. I've been told the burnt ends are amazing, but unfortunately they were out. Get there early!"}
{"text":"I am not a HUGE fan of smoked foods.  Most of my experiences with smoked meats ended up leaving an \"ash-tray\" taste in the mouth, or really dry meat.  But at Black Dog, I LOVED IT.  My husband cleared his plate faster then I have ever seen - and said straight away that his food was the BEST smoked pulled pork he had ever had.  I had the beef brisket, and damn, it was good.  Can't beat the price tag, I mean, really?  If I remember correctly, our bill was less then $15!"}
{"text":"Everything is worth trying here! (even the smoked almonds!) But the pièce de résistance are the burnt ends. Go early, else they will run out.
The only problem is the wait... If you don't beat the masses, just order for take out."}
{"text":"Literally the best restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area. The BBQ is phenomenal and you will never find a better burger."}
{"text":"Top shelf real BBQ joint. I have been twice for lunch and both times I was glad I did. The staff are very helpful and the food is fantastic. I have dined at quite a lot of BBQ places in the south and I am very impressed and suprised that such a great place is located in Central Illinois."}
{"text":"I'm not even much of a BBQ fan, but this place is excellent!  By far the best place for for barbecue in the CU.  Loved the pulled pork, burnt ends, even the fries were great!  The potato casserole is amazing.  Good beer selection.  Fun, casual bar atmosphere and the food comes out on metal pans :)

Get here early, because it's a small space and fills up quick.  There is usually quite a line, sometimes out the door.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat anywhere. I've had smoked meat all over the US and this place has topped all! I stop in every chance I can."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you've ever had real southern bbq or are from Chicago you will hate this restaurant. Its disgusting. The food is not good at all."}
{"text":"Always the best BBQ in CU. Chicken, ribs, catfish...great sauces and fries. Come early - there's usually a line."}
{"text":"I  can be a bit critical of bbq, and I love this place.  The meat is good enough without sauce, and that's all I need.

I recommend the smoked catfish.  I haven't had any smoked fish like this; it's amazing. 

The service is nice, kind waitress.  I guess they can run out of food.  That's kind of like the good bbq joints you would run across in the South.  Go early."}
{"text":"Might have been the worst service I have had at any place in downtown. I work downtown and frequent all the local eateries, and was very dissatisfied. I sat at the bar and ordered a drink and $40 worth of food. 50 minutes later I was told my food order \"was not placed\", and still was not offered another drink while I waited. I had 1 drink in 50 minutes, never offered another. I eventually got up and left after an hour of waiting for 2 orders of the 3 meat combo. We went to Big Grove Tavern instead. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"If you are in the Urbana-Champaign area, dinning at this join is a must! Without a doubt they have great BBQ sauces, great rib tips, and overall its affordable!

If your party consists of more than 2 people plan on a long wait. (at least 30-45 minutes) unless you come right when they open. 

Fox News placed Black Dog in Top 10 BBQ places in the US. Their service isn't quite top notch (Since this place is always crowded)

Pros: good food, afforadable eat.
Cons: long wait, average to below average service

Recommendation: call in and place an order for pick up. Sit at home or park anywhere else and enjoy their delicious food without having to wait for long."}
{"text":"I went to Black Dog for lunch after hearing many good reviews from my friends who have been frequenting this BBQ smokehouse. I did not really look over the menu because I knew what I wanted before going: the Thursday special, the BBQ burrito. I placed my order and within five minutes my lunch was placed before me. Added into the burrito was pico de gallo, house salsa, cheese, saute'd poblano peppers and smoked turkey. It was an interesting combination; not quite mexican, but not quite pure BBQ. It was filled with flavor. The only issue I had with this dish was how much juice/grease was inside my burrito. It ended up falling apart, but luckily the lunch came prepared with a fork and knife to clean up the scrapes. Based off of this dish, I am sure a pure BBQ dish would be quite delicious, but I am going to reserve a 5 star review until I can try it out. As a summary, the service was nice and quick, I was a fan of the atmosphere, and the food left me wanting more."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Black Dog, and so happy that they're opening another location in downtown Champaign. There are only two downsides to the place: everything tends to be a bit smoky (so if you don't like that, be aware) and there's always a line out the door. 

The food is great. The pulled pork is a personal favorite, and while I never switch away from the Carolina Red (reminds me of barbecue at home) my friends love the Georgia Peach sauce. The brisket is also good- nice and tender- and the rib tips are fantastic. I don't like cornbread, but theirs is good (plus they bake meat into the bread- always a plus). They've recently slimmed down their beer menu a bit, but it's still very diverse, as is their whiskey menu. There are a lot of bourbons here that you can't order elsewhere in town (including Evan Williams 1783, a personal favorite). 

The place is too damn small and I wish they'd have burnt ends a bit more often (they're very good). But I can't really complain."}
{"text":"It's like the Urbana one, but bigger. I always get the same thing- a pulled pork platter with the Carolina Red sauce. It's good barbecue- nice and smoky, and the wide variety of sauces is great. I wish they'd pick a location that wasn't so narrow and awkward. I generally dine out for that reason. If you do eat in, the bar selection is excellent and the staff is great. Just go at off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Yummy food and drink! I am not in this part of town often so I can't go a lot, but I enjoy it whenever I do. Has very flavorful BBQ.... hard to compare to anything else!
Also, they often have pictures of black rescue dogs that need homes. Love that! Great way to show your support for adoption!  They get brownie points in my book for that!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but I have to admit the worst element of dining here is the customer service. I've eaten here on multiple occasions (because the food IS incredible), and have always felt as if I, the customer, was inconveniencing the staff for simply being there. 

From asking for an estimate on the wait time, to inquiring about the beverages, to calling in for take out, I've felt like they knew their food was great and one-of-a-kind in Urbana-Champaign and therefore service was secondary. 

Being one of the best food establishments in Urbana-Champaign in terms of taste/quality, it would be nice if their customer service was on par."}
{"text":"It was just simply amazing! I don't think I have tasted BBQ that is this good! Although I usually don't go for BBQ b/c I dont like the smoky taste... This place actually made it taste amazing! Their BBQ sauce was also spot on. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Good place to hangout with friends and colleagues after work. The decoration is pretty unique. They have multiple sauces for you to choose from. The corn bread is 100% recommended."}
{"text":"Loved everything we had.  Too bad the place isnt bigger, because it was completely packed while we were there.  Really wanted the burnt tips, but they were gone before we got there."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I would go there everyday if it were possible. Never gets old. Must visit if in town. Normally there is a long line, and it can take some time to get a table; but believe me, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Had pulled pork with twice baked potato casserole.  My wife had pulled chicken and the smoked sweet potato.  Everything was very good and the prices were great. The meat was juicy and had a nice smokey flavor."}
{"text":"Black Dog is hands down some of the best bbq I have ever eaten. I love their cuban sandwich (Wednesday only), their cornbread, their chicken wings, and their pulled pork sandwich. I think the burnt ends are overrated."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the CU. A must eat! My menu favorite is the Carolina Burger with cheddar (pulled pork on a locally sourced beef hamburger and Carolina red sauce- which is the best bbq sauce i've ever had, with the perfect amount of spice and flavor and not sickly sweet). Everything is good here though honestly you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Hands down, best BBQ place in the C/U area. I know that's not saying a lot but this place is legit. I have eaten here more times than I can count and I have had almost everything on the menu, and I have NEVER had something I didn't like. I always get the wings as an appetizer and they are amazing! my favorite thing on the menu is the cuban sandwich which you can only get on Wednesdays but I seriously live for them. The only thing that sucks is the seating, there is always a wait but this place is worth waiting for :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to taste great barbecue in Illinois, but Black Dog surprised me!  I enjoyed the smoked chicken, made with local free range chicken.  I love that Black Dog uses local ingredients!  The food is delicious & the service was great too!"}
{"text":"this place has great food.

unfortunately it has...

long lines,

a feeling of being rushed to get you in/out,

and last night, warm beer while waited for my carryout.

this place simply isn't a relaxing place to eat a meal."}
{"text":"This place is doing it right.  I had the beef brisket today and you could cut it with a fork.  Add sweet potato fries and red Carolina sauce and you have a GREAT meal.  Also had smoked corn on the cob and it was outstanding.  This is a must if you are in or near downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come here every time we are in Champaign-Urbana. Love the pork ribs, burnt ends (appetizer), and the twice-baked potato casserole.  
Our favorite BBQ sauces are Georgia Peach, Lexington, and Carolina Vinegar."}
{"text":"Black Dog has the best food! The staff is friendly and the service superb. 

The only negative comment I have is that you must wait for a long time to get a table, but I guarantee the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend if you are in the area it's s real hole in the wall you better get here early though it gets busy! But the bbq is top notch! Try the burnt ends and ribs!"}
{"text":"The Smoked Catfish sandwich with the Cabbage and Mustard sauce is a fantastic surprise. Make sure to order it after 5pm when the Baked Sweet Potatoes come out of the oven as your included side. I order this item religiously and guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Black Dog is a staple of Champaign-Urbana by now. Coming from Texas, I didn't expect to find great BBQ, especially in Urbana, but I'm so glad I was wrong. The food here is fantastic and I recommend waiting out the long line to eat. It's well worth it. 

I highly recommend the Texas caviar as an appetizer. If I didn't care about my waistline I would order it every time. The burnt ends are good - there's a reason they sell out like crazy - but I don't think they're the best value for your money. I usually get the hot polish and brisket with the twice baked potato casserole and baked beans. The fries are also great, but I LOVE the potato casserole. You're missing out if you don't get it. My boyfriend loves the rib tips. I think they're the best value for your money, but I get annoyed putting that much effort into eating ;-)

The sweet tea isn't great. I wouldn't order it if you're looking for legit sweet tea. The Carolina red sauce is my favorite. Black Dog switched their default sauce from that to the Lexington something other. Not sure why because I think the new default sauce isn't great at all. The Georgia peach is also good, but of you don't like sweet sauce stick with the Carolina. 

I will definitely miss Black Dog after leaving Champaign."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket platter which was pretty good. Not sure I'd agree that its the best barbeque ever but decent. The waiting area situation was horrendous. At least 10 people jammed into a tiny area near the front door. Tried to get a drink at the bar while waiting but was told I was in the wrong area to order drinks....really! Service at the bar was terrible but waitress at table was good. Looking forward to the second location in Champaign assuming its larger venue."}
{"text":"Amazing food and worth the wait. Waiter was very nice and funny. One of the best BBQ places I've had and the best in Central Illinois for sure!"}
{"text":"Cool place overall.  Waited about 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday.  They ran out of some of their more well known dishes, but they still had pulled pork which is one of my favorites.  Food came out fast, and was pretty tasty.  The sauces were pretty good too.  This place gets a lot of hype, not sure that I would say its the best BBQ in the country, but it's pretty good.  I've had some better BBQ in the south.  Definitely would come back though."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a new place in the Chambana area during football season and somehow Black Dog had eluded us.  Luckily I ran into a friend who opened our eyes.  

We went to the ASU night game and after a long night of cheering we were hungry!  We arrived around 9:30 / 10:00 pm and the place was still pretty full.  When we sat down the server announced that they were out of quite a few menu items.  We weren't shy about our disappointment and a little bit later the server told us they were going to make more of the twice baked potato casserole.  Hooray!  Oh and they were DELICIOUS!

Everything was so good.  The bbq has more of a smoked flavor which I really like.  I ordered the pulled pork with the house sauce.  The sauce was a bit spicy (I am a wimp) but I did sample some others that I liked.  

I can't wait to go back to try some burnt ends and some other sauces."}
{"text":"My son is a U of I student and recommended eating here. It was good food, good service, good craft beers on tap. Little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now (previously in 2013), and it has been terrific both times! The pulled pork and brisket burnt ends are kick-ass, as good as anything I had on a recent trip to Austin, TX. The coleslaw is perfect with the pulled pork, and the Mac & cheese and twice-baked potatoes are also delicious. Great beer list and good service as well."}
{"text":"This place is goood!
The meat is always fresh and tender and cooked just right. Everything I've ordered there, on multiple occasions, has been spot on and smoked just right. It's pretty interesting to see such a place in tiny downtown Champaign. 
The place looks and smells awesome too. Once you enter into the tiny grunge-designed restaurant, the smokey smell of meats will serve as an early indication that you've come to the right place. 

The only issue with Black Dog is the wait. It's such a tiny place that if you go there at most times of the day, you will have to wait a good deal for your table. I had to sometimes resort to ordering out; however, when you're not in too much of a hurry, the ambience will convince you to stick around."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in the area, hands down. Love the ends, brisket and pulled pork. I get the sweet Georgia peach sauce because I'm pretty much a light weight on hot food. It's perfect for me. 

The cornbread is by far my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, I have purchased just that. Always ask for more butter, though!

They do take-out really well, which is nice since they're always so busy. Everything is wrapped individually and easily reheated. 

Service is always great. Beers are pretty good. 

So why the four stars? Partly because I can't give 4.5...but mostly because I LOVE a bloody Mary, and theirs are just terrible. I've tried x3 with no success. They taste overwhelmingly of actual bbq sauce and meat. Like a liquid dinner platter. If that's your thing, go for the 5 stars."}
{"text":"New to town and am less than impressed.  The food is good but the service leaves alot to be desired.  Long long wait.  Have been there twice and both times expierenced nothing but attitude from all the servers.  Especially if you have questions about the menu!  Wait, attitude of employees and lack of space takes away from the quality of the food.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"The best time to go here is 3:30 or 4. Otherwise you will have a pretty long wait as this is not a big restaurant. We had the brisket which was excellent. We had just been to a Chicago restaurant for brisket and this was a lot better. The Georgia peach bbq sauce was wonderful. The slaw wasn't so good but the baked potato casserole was pretty good. Our waitress was Olivia who was delightful. She explained menu items and was very attentive to our table. I had read bad reviews about their wait staff,  but the people who
 greeted us and Olivia couldn't have been any nicer."}
{"text":"Wow, I love the black dog. The first time I had gone there i had the catfish. Amazing. 2nd time, beef tips. Also amazing. It's cheap, friendly, and has great food. The only downside, limited space. I had to wait around half an hour before i could be seated, but it was well worth the wait. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant to ANYBODY because I don't want to have to wait even longer for my little piece of BBQ heaven. Best BBQ in Chambana."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Plenty of people have written about the food (too many amazing dishes to list, but I could live on the sweet potato fries and the ribs) and the beer (the selection is so good, and it rotates, and it's so cold and delicious).  But once you get spoiled enough by the food, and you start to take it for granted, because after all you know that it will be fantastic and you don't care if you have to wait, and you don't even care if you have to sit at the weird little time out table in the very back, you start to ask yourself the hard questions. What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing? What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony?  

Well, after twenty visits, I've figure it out.  It's that waiter. You know the one. The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar.  This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe, because he's nice. He's kind.  He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly.  This guy will tell you everything you need to know. He will not patronize you, rush you, brush you off, or forget your table.  He will shine his magical hipster/doofus sparkle charm on you.  He is the patron saint of this restaurant. Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink.  Obey him.  Thank him.  

Seriously, who is this guy?  I love this guy."}
{"text":"Please, please, please, put one of these restaurants in Bloomington-Normal.

Although this restaurant  is small,  the pulled pork sandwich that I ordered was wonderful.     The mixture of pork, coleslaw, and Georgia Peach bbq sauce that they put on the sandwich really hit the spot.

The sweet potato fries were solid too.

My only complaint about the food was with the \"hot\" version of the Georgia Peach bbq sauce that we also tried.  Avoid it - the restaurant needs to tweak that sauce a bit.   It's really hot."}
{"text":"Average meat, creative and tasty sides, disappointing sauces. I was impressed that they pack the place as soon as the doors open and start a waiting list. The meat was what I would expect from a BBQ place but without a good sauce I was disappointed. I tried 3 and didn't like any of them."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good. The brisket was the best I've ever eaten. Don't miss the burnt ends!"}
{"text":"Amazing beef brisket, tasty BBQ sauce, and good selection of beers."}
{"text":"My wife's birthday was over the weekend, and it seemed like having a good lunch was in the cards. Being a big barbeque fan, she selected the Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. We had heard so many good things about it that we finally decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.

We were aware that the biggest drawback would be the wait for a table, so we left home early to get there right before it opened. Several other people had the same idea. We were given a nice greeting upon entering and were seated immediately. We were told that we might have a bit of a wait for service since we were seated before the place opened, but our waitress came by right away. We decided to start the meal with the appetizer we were most curious about: the burnt ends. Although a tad pricy, the meat lived up to everything we had read -- flavorful, wonderfully chewy around the edges, with melt-in-your mouth smoky goodness.

For our lunch, we both had pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and an additional side of twice baked potato casserole. The sandwiches were excellent -- wonderfull smokey meat, slaw, and excellent Carolina Red barbeque sauce. The sweet potato french fries actually tasted like sweet potatoes, but I am not sure why others have raved about them. They were just okay, as was the casserole. But ... we came to this place looking for excellent barbecue, and it delivered!

We were happy we decided to eat right when the place opened because a line formed as we were eating our lunch. We decided to make a quick exit so that someone else could get our table. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.

Would we come here again? Definitely! Next time I would like to try the Georgia Peach barbeque sauce and sample the chicken and catfish. I decided to only go with four stars because the sides were only average in our estimation. Next time we will try some others."}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet barbecue, would stand up to any of the best barbecue restaurants in Kansas City."}
{"text":"Black Dog is by far the best BBQ in the chambana area and, in my opinion, one of the best (maybe the best) restaurant in chambana. I might be biased since I love BBQ and, as I said, this place definitely has the best BBQ in the area. I've been coming here regularly for 3 years and I have never been disappointed.

A heads up to anyone that hasn't been here before, you will probably have to wait in line. In the 3 years that I've been coming here I've only been seated without waiting in line once and that was when I came on a Tuesday in the middle of the summer before the dinner rush. The longest I've waited was 2 hours and it was still totally worth it! If you're not down for a wait, you can just call ahead and get your food to go or even make a to go order in person if you get there and decide the line is too long.

The most recommended dish has to be the burnt ends, but they run out quickly. They make burnt ends twice a day (at 11:00 am and 5:00 pm, I think). I would also highly recommend the ribs and rib tips. I generally get the brisket and chicken as well, but I wouldn't say those are the most amazing dishes. They've got plenty of BBQ sauces to choose from as well. I've recently been getting the mustard, which is delicious with everything I've tried it with (brisket, chicken, ribs, rib tips, burnt ends).

If you're in the area and you want great BBQ this is the only place to go."}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ snob having tried some of the best across the country.  One thing I've learned is when it comes to BBQ quality it can vary a lot even within the same place.  If you hit lunch or dinner when the BBQ is just ready you can be amazed with the flavor, tenderness, and juiciness. (Is that even a word? :).  If you miss these prime spots it's 50/50 on what you will get. My brisket was tender but very dry. Dipping it in the various BBQ sauces wasn't enough to revive it.  If it's supposed to be tender but dry then it's perfect. Chicken was similar. Sides were all fantastic. Ribs were just ok.  Based on the reviews I had huge expectations.  Chalk it up to the variation in quality?  Don't know, but I won't be back and it's common to find places a lot better."}
{"text":"Get the burnt ends. The pork belly is worth a try. Do not get the ribs. Will try the rib tips next time. Four stars.

Edit:  dropped a star because I have never seen such a confusing receipt in my life.  I am not sure how they account for amounts charged to a card.  It does not make sense, especially when read together with other receipts at the same table.  After adding up the numbers myself, it appears that I was probably charged the correct amount (or at least close to it), but I cannot say for sure.  Pay with cash if you can."}
{"text":"Good bbq and good beer. Enough said. Get the texas breakfast drink with a garnish of bacon. Me and my buddy Aaron's invention. Ask for it!!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the place in Urbana to cramped always loud. The new one in Champaign is great"}
{"text":"\"Best Food In Champaign-Urbana!\"

Although there is always generally a wait, and if you want their delicious Burnt Ends you have to come early in the evening, Black Dog is well worth it. Nearly everything you order at Black Dog is excellent. The southern-style smoky greatness of their BBQ and sides is mouth watering. Black Dog offers a great list of whiskeys and also serves many good micro-brews. Burnt Ends and Spare Ribs are extremely good, as is their side order of Smoky Pit Beans. Occasionally I'll order a Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pull pork on top, when I want to mix things up. Many people rave about their corn bread, as it is also delicious. Daily specials help keep the mix of food fresh, however I could never grow tired of Black Dog. Recently the restaurant started serving special Late Night items after 10:30pm that features special cocktails and menu items (like Gourmet Hot Dogs/Sausages) that you cannot order during regular hours, which are great as well. Try Black Dog, you won't regret it, but you might just feel frustrated thinking about the soonest time you can come back for more. 

Note: When choosing a sauce, Hot Georgia Peach is the way to go. (But hell, you can order a Flight of Sauces and try them all for yourself. Enjoy!)"}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about this place and was anxious to give it a try.

The night we went, their smoker was broken!  So all their famous barbecue dishes were unavailable!  Seems like they could have told us this before we waited 1/2 hour for a table!  

We were hungry, so we stayed anyway, and had burgers.  They were decent, but I went there for barbecue!

So if you go, you might want to ask when you get there if there are any problems in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best BBQ food in the CU. It's almost silly to give this place another 5 star review because pretty much everyone knows its awesome. Come early so that you can get Burndt Ends, which always sell out. They make them twice a day, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Don't come during peak hours because you'll probably wait 45mins for a table."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, brisket is amazing, Georgia peach barbecue sauce sweet and hot, sweet potato fries oh my, definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Some of the best beef brisket I've ever had - sauce is not necessary. There's usually a wait but you won't regret it. I ate here the first week they opened and the quality of the BBQ astounded me at the time - it has only gotten better since. I hope it does well because the trip to Urbana is faster than driving to 17th Street BBQ in Murphysboro. The Pit Beans are totally necessary as a side. They also have a decent beer selection with some good microbrews on tap."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not southern enough, or maybe I just don't care for BBQ... but I wasn't overly excited by Blackdog. You wait in line forever, and they really just have normal meat and fries. 

I can't say I found the sauces to be special either. 

I know they are famous, but not to me. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Burnt ends = yummy/fatty/juicy 
Everything else is too dry and/or bland

I've tried every item on the combo plate except for the turkey special they have sometimes, and I am seriously disappointed by the dryness of the ribs and the brisket. The pulled pork is more moist but flavorless, so you really need to drench it with sauce."}
{"text":"On BBQ alone, just the meat, I think Lil Porgy's is just as good, but certain things make this better in my mind:
-Side dishes are far superior
-They serve beer
-Burnt ends, when you can get them
The really big downside is that the space is tiny, making the wait extremely long. They will do takeout if you call in, I highly recommend this option."}
{"text":"Two words... Burnt ends. Get there early for them or later in the evening because they are SOLID & they disappear quickly. I like this place a lot and eat here often while in town. The brisket sandwich is a must. The fine selection of bbq sauces go well with just about anything. The staff is always friendly and on top of things. If you are in the area, you must eat here."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in town for barbecue... on top of that its got an excellent atmosphere. I generally stick to the pulled pork and cornbread - don't miss out.  They also have about 5 beer taps - and they are always hooked up to something good.

The place is kind of small and it's always crowded around meal times, so plan on stopping in before you get hungry."}
{"text":"Definitely a love hate relationship with this place. The food is absolutely amazing. I always get the Texas Burger. The serving staff needs A LOT of work. Hostess was very nice.  We've been in twice in the last month and had similar experiences each time. The waitress was rude. Didn't seem to want to be there. Refills never were given. Onions forgotten both time for my burger (kitchen staff needs to know menu items better),  BBQ sauce forgotten on second visit.  When the kitchen staff runs out of an item from the menu,  instead of just writing it down on a board in the back like every restaurant I've worked at they scream it from the kitchen and all the servers on the floor scream it back. Quite annoying.  The thing I found really odd is their closing process. They don't leave a ticket at your table so you can review your bill. I had to ask to see the charges before payment, and instead of printing a receipt she showed me on her tablet,  very awkward. Also,  the waitress had her long hair down. Kept using her hands to push her hair behind her ears. I'm assuming she didn't wash her hands every time she did that, and I'm sure her hair will find its way into someone's food sometime."}
{"text":"This is good bbq folks! In Champaign/Urbana whodda thunk? First time visit had pulled pork, burnt ends, cole slaw and bbq beans. Meat was plenty flavorful, and not dried out. In fact the burnt ends were remarkably not dry. Lots of smoky flavor, so good. In my opinion, what makes really good bbq is some attention to sides, and these absolutely did not dissapoint. Slaw was crispy, fresh and savory. Good balance of flavors and not too sweet or creamy. Beans were equally well done, really savory and again seemingly devoid of the too much sugar syndrome of extremely mediocre bbq joints. This place is soooo not a mediocre joint, cant wait to get a chance to go back!

{"text":"I wish I could contribute something significant but it's all been said before. Black dog is the best, period. Pulled chicken sandwich with extra Georgia peach + sweet potato fries = all I need in life. Love the vinegar based slaw. Maybe they should consider a 3rd location in Chicago...!"}
{"text":"Smaller hole in wall kind of place w modern Irish Style settings but limited seating durning lunch time. Yet the wait is definitely worth it! 
The BBQ aroma is welcoming when the front door is opened. 
Many different types of sandwiches and sauces. Sweet potato fries!!!! And of course many beers!
Awesome college hot spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in town. It can take a bit to get a table, but they have a bar and you're encouraged to grab a beer or cocktail to enjoy while you wait. One you're seated, service is super fast and the food is almost instantly at your table. I recommend the flight of sauces to accompany anything on the menu. They're nachos and sliders are on point. Favorite place in town."}
{"text":"We seem to be on a BBQ tour of the midwest.  This is one of our top 3.  The place is tiny so be prepared to wait.   The service is very attentive considering how packed the place always seems to be.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down - best barbeque place (and best restaurant, in my opinion) in the Champaign/Urbana area! I've tried almost everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the spare ribs with a smoked sweet potato.

There's usually a really long wait to be seated if you go during dinner hours (6-9pm), but if you are willing to sit at the bar, its not too bad. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Ever since graduating last year, I insist on going here almost every time I go up to Champaign! The only entree I've ever had here has been the brisket sandwich, and it is phenomenal! If you show up early, try to order the \"burnt ends\" if they are available, those must be the best thing on the menu from what I've heard. The sweet potato fries are delicious, as are the smoked chicken wings!

If you can't decide which sauce to have (my favorite is the Texas BBQ sauce, which has beef drippings and ancho peppers as the base. They should seriously consider bottling+ selling their sauces, because they are all amazing), you can order a \"flight of sauces\"-- a sampler of all their available homemade BBQ sauces for $3. 

This place almost always has a line and not the most abundant seating, so it's best to show up during \"off hours\". e.g. before 11:30 and after 1:30."}
{"text":"Edit: Flaws ironed out and the Black Dog is Heaven! Full 5-star experience every time!

Original review: Very good! In brief, my wife and I have found the service to be friendly and efficient, the food to be intensely flavorful, and the cost quite reasonable. Add to this good beer, and you have a restaurant that it is fast becoming our default meal when we don't have a specific craving and just want a nice night out.

We have eaten widely from the menu, and especially recommend the wings, the pulled pork, and the cornbread. They often have specials, which so far have also been great.

There are still a few small kinks, such as only having four napkin dispensers along the entire bar that seats 15 or so people (I had to ask for napkins, which one should never need to do at a barbecue joint! And then they needed to be taken away for someone else, and I had to ask for them again...). Hopefully the owners read reviews and/or use their common sense to iron out what few flaws currently exist."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to give it a four - I'm leaning toward a three because I'm still bitter that they were out of the turkey and salmon when we got there. They were also out of the burnt ends, which I expected, but turkey? That was disappointing. And then I asked for green beans made with NO BUTTER, because I'm lactose intolerant and butter does not sit well. But they must be pre-made because she said they were made with butter... with no offer or mention of making them without butter. All that said, the chicken that I ended up getting, and the smoked sweet potato (which are my absolute favorite), were amazing. And the cole slaw was vinegar based and pretty amazing too. Plus, I had leftovers, which I can never disagree with. Really, the reason I land on a 3 is because they don't have all of their BBQ sauces out. Instead, you have to choose one when you order and that's the only one you get. The problem is - I don't know what kind I want.. Can't I just try them all to figure it out? Eh. I'm more about the restaurant than the food itself - and I was disappointed by the restaurant but LOVED the food. So I'm torn."}
{"text":"Hearing the words barbecue and central Illinois the association isn't immediately sensible or clear. But take a seat at Black Dog and give the best barbecue in central Illinois and arguably some of the best barbecue in the country a try. The original Black Dog location which has been open a couple years, is a narrow and small place, always packed to the brim. Expect to wait for lunch or dinner and even into the early afternoon and evening, this place will be busting at the seams. But that shouldn't be a discouragement, come ready to wait, and ready to eat, because the food is incredible, the beer selection consistently interesting and varied.

And the food. There is not a bad option, but there is a best option. The burnt ends, for those not familiar with burnt ends, this is the meat from the end of the brisket pieces prepared for lunch, so there is a limited number. The burnt ends name is a slight misnomer, these are not burnt, but they are cooked, ends of meat, and are immensely flavorful. Topped with a variety of sauces there are some really great options, including Georgia peach (spicy and not) and a few acidic sauces. The sides are also a hit with an amazing twice baked casserole as well as great beans, mac and cheese (on the right day), and sweet potato fries.

Don't hesitate, or balk at a wait in line for a table, head here now. Hopefully the new location to be opened in the neat older train station in Champaign will help make some space for meals in both locations, the demand certainly seems to be there."}
{"text":"One night I thought I wanted a big plate of beef but made a last minute, super impulsive decision to get their chicken salad sandwich. I was instantly overcome by anxiety and concern that I had just made yet another decision to regret forever but it arrived and it was AMAZING. Honestly, I'm probably always going to get it now."}
{"text":"wow, this place redefined my expectations for BBQ."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good.  Unfortunately, because they have such a selection of sauces, it's not really feasible to cook the meat with the sauce, so the sauce is just added to your order at the end.  Good, but not as good as it could be.  Having the options makes up for it though.

The reason it only gets three stars is because the restaurant is too small.  There isn't enough room for large groups to sit together, and if you're not early, there will be a very long wait.  It's also fairly loud (small space, lots of people, of course it's loud)."}
{"text":"After many years of living in Champaign/Urbana this is the place to take friends, guests, and all the like. The restaurant is a tad small but I think that adds immensely to its charm. The smells are fabulous and will have you drooling. There is usually a wait unless you come at an off meal time so expect that. The prices are reasonable and their is always a great beer selection to choose from. Love their weekly specials especially Cuban Sandwich Wednesday - brings back a lot of fond memories. Get there early though so they don't run out of what you want (:"}
{"text":"my all-time favorite bbq place. high quality meats and sides. great variety of bbq sauce. service is always good even when they are busy. staff very friendly. non-offensive music played at a non-offensive volume. A+"}
{"text":"Best place to get some good BBQ in Champaign. There is usually a wait, but it is worth it! I love and always get the ribs. There are a few different BBQ sauces that you can try. It is nice that the sauce is not on the meat but comes on the side to allow you to taste the meat itself. I've had their cow rib special once and that was delicious as well, but it is a lot of meat. Most of their sides are also very good. I've heard that if you don't want to wait in line, you could always order take-out which kind of eliminates the waiting part. I don't recommend going here with more than 4 people because it is a smaller restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Best I have tried in five states. Recommend the smoked salmon and the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Oh Black Dog...how much do I love you? Let me count the ways :) Simply, one of the best bbq places I have ever visited.Just thinking about it and I start to salivate."}
{"text":"OH YES!!!  Plan on waiting for a table..... as there are not many in the place..... plan on wondering how clean the kitchen is.... as it looks a little rough as well as the employees.... BUT plan on putting INCREDIBLE BBQ in your mouth!!  You will NOT be disappointed with the food at this restaurant.  They really need to expand and grow..... so worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Black Dog. The Urbana location has such a homey and cozy feel. The servers have great personalities and it is such a pleasant experience. However, I would definitely recommend checking out the Champaign location if you have a party larger than 4 or if you want to dine during prime hours.

Today my fiance and I came to Black Dog for a late lunch. It was Taco Tuesday so we tried the special. We each got a pulled pork, brisket, and burnt ends taco (three tacos each). The tacos were in flour tortillas and had cilantro and onions on top. Salsa was served on the side. The tacos were all delicious but the burnt ends were definitely superior (as always). The only change I would make is to add a side of barbecue sauce (Texas or Lexington on the side). I missed the sauce on the meats and think I might've preferred it to the salsa.

We also had the smoked chex mix --- yum!

Black Dog has between 6 and 8 beers on draft usually, including a cask beer. Today I had Triptych's Xoco stout which is amazing. You can generally find a local option along with some well-known breweries such as Stone or Ballast Point.

My fiance and I normally share a three-meat platter which really gets you the most bang for your buck. Try the sauce flight if you want to experiment with different sauces!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere!  A great place to eat dinner and hang out. 

Back again, still amazing food and a great atmosphere!

Get the sauce sampler, along with the habanero, and share with a friend!  awesome sauce(s)!"}
{"text":"I've been to some of the best smokehouses in the nation and B-Dogs can hang with any of them. They are consistently good to include the sides and beer selections."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and beer selection, Champaign or Urbana. If I really want to thank someone I do it with a BD gift certificate, then they know I mean it. ;)"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!! Amazing atmosphere, bar is great and food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and while I've never been blown away, I was never disappointed either. I got exactly what I was looking for--quality BBQ with homemade sides. It was a plus that it carried all sorta of craft beers as well. Wait time were long however which is the main reason I always decide against going into urbana to eat here."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Loved everything I have ever eaten here.  Well worth the wait and trust me, you will usually have a wait (20-30 minutes).  Small venue but so incredibly good.  Real smoked pork and brisket.  The smoked salmon is tremendous and the twice baked casserole.  Beer selection rotates almost weekly and they even have something on cask most of the time.  There is ample parking on street and in an adjoining lot.  More seating would make it perfect!"}
{"text":"Normally get the smoked catfish but got the Amish smoked half chicken, side of pit beans and slaw. It took us about an hour to be seated but always worth it. Ask if you have allergies, they can accommodate."}
{"text":"Black Dog is one of my go-to spots in Champaign (and Urbana).

My husband and I always order a three-meat platter with two sides. For $21.95 this is a great option for a couple to share and we always get the sauce flight, too. Our meat selection varies depending on the specials offered. You can't go wrong with Burnt Ends, Brisket, Pulled Pork, or Chicken. At times the meat has seemed a bit dry but the sauces and quick service make up for it. I highly recommend the fries, twice-baked casserole, or mac and cheese for side options. The real MVP though is the succotash. WOW. Refreshing in the spring and summer!

There are always local craft beer options on draft from Triptych and a cask option is usually available, too.

TIP --- Try sitting at the bar. You'll be seated faster and the service rocks."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm soooo good. I went here for the first time last week. This place gets packed as the doors open. There isn't a lot of seating here. You might have to wait an hour for your food but it is worth the wait. If you like pulled pork or good food you should come here. The sweet potato fries are one of the best I have had, and the bbq sauces are good. I was not a fan of the beans, they had too much of a smokey flavor. The sweet tea was on point. The waitress was really friendly and interacted well with all the customers. For such a busy place they do a great job with customer service. Everyone in the area needs to experience this place at least once in their lifetime."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. As in, \"I don't eat meat but I eat BBQ at Black Dog\" good. 

I've been a  \"peskaterian/vegetarian\" for over 4 years but upon a recent trip down south decided to indulge in some good ol' southern BBQ, and well... I'm a little lax in the meat eating department now. At least when it comes quality, well cooked, BBQ. You wont see me scarfing down a McRib, or eating meat anywhere else for that matter but give me some Black Dog pulled pork and I'll make an exception. 

You walk in and write your name and party number on the sheet. I've been here twice now and it was spot on both times. You'll have to wait a little unless you get take out but it's worth it.

They have different specials each night and tend to run out of stuff so go early if you have your heart set on the burnt ends (I've yet to try them because they were sold out both times).  

First time I got the 1/2 rack of ribs with mac & cheese, and coleslaw.

Second time they only had 1/4 rack of ribs so I got the pick two with the pulled pork, coleslaw, and baked beans. 

Pulled pork was amazing! Tender and smokey, and full of flavor. That will be my go to order now. Mac and cheese is indulgent and delicious, coleslaw is of the vinegar (not creamy) variety which I love. Baked beans (they call them something else) were good, but too heavy for me personally. I'd eat them again though. The ribs were my favorite until I tried the pulled pork. They're still a close second.

I could be a good vegetarian and the get the portabello sandwich with fresh chevre and roasted red pepper that sounds amazing, and maybe I will one day when my conscience overcomes me. But there's something for everyone there, so non-meat eaters will be just as satisfied I'm sure."}
{"text":"Two words to describe this joint: outstanding BBQ.  If you eat meat, this is a place you have to try.  Great ribs, great pork, great brisket.  The wait is always really long to get a table cause the food is fantastic, but the space is a bit small for the demand."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'd drop a star is for the wait time. I've had burnt ends and the salmon, and both were amazing. Sauces are quite nice, ask to sample a few different sauces. On the heavier side, but so good!"}
{"text":"As far as bbq goes in central Illinois, I was very pleased with my meal.  Stopped in with a couple friends for a late Friday lunch with a brief wait for a table.

A decent beer selection got us started along with smoked chicken wings and cornbread muffins that are made with pulled pork bits. Both were excellent!  I ordered a 3 item combo selecting brisket, pork ribs, and pulled pork served with a flight of about 10 different sauces! For sides I selected twice baked potato caserole and mac n cheese.  Good stuff!  The brisket was tender, the pulled pork was tasty, but the ribs were my favorite. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely outstanding. My friends and I come here all the time, usually about twice a week, with an obligatory visit to their late-night. Every single item I've had was delicious. From burnt ends, to beef ribs, pork ribs, pastrami sandwiches, smoked duck, fried chicken, brisket, and a stupid number of late night home made sausages among other things, every single entree is a new and delicious adventure. The meat is smoked to perfection, the dry rubs are all world class, and you get your choice of BBQ sauce to suit your taste. The cornbread even has pulled pork baked into it. The sides are all good, but the best are definitely the sweet potato fries. I did not expect to find food this good in Urbana-Champaign, but here it is. This place is a real hidden gem.

But this place doesn't stop at the food. The beer selection is great, with an awesome bottled selection (not huge, but it's quality), and a constantly changing set of beers on tap. Add to this their whiskey selection and cocktails (pineapple pepper tequila margarita...) , and this place is a fantastic bar on top of being a top-notch restaurant.

Oh, and did I mention the price is beyond reasonable? 5/5 this place is worth a visit. Or two. Or twenty."}
{"text":"Best bbq I know of.  Moved to St. Louis 2 years ago but went to Black Dog many times before I left, and saw their menu and product evolve.   I continue to take meat and sauce home to this day when in the area.  If anything, they have created a monster, with waits (sometimes lengthy) at any meal time.  Go off-hours if you can.  I find their burnt ends, pork belly, chicken wing starters, beef brisket, and Carolina and Texas sauces some of the best things I have had at any bbq joint.  Given the crowds, service is good, but it can get hectic.  Not a place to linger and talk unless you get there at an off-time.  This space itself is pleasant with warm colors, and flatscreens have games going all the time.  Probably best bbq between the Chicago area and perhaps Murphysboro (17th St. Bar and Grill), some 5 hours south.  Warning - not sure who owns the parking lot to the north of the building, but it is in AWFUL shape.  Beware."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  I had the pick two combo with brisket and ribs.  Everything tasted great!  The staff had great energy and appeared to work well together.  My two year old chowed down on Mac n cheese.  Also, they have a nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"Between all the hype in online reviews and the lines which are consistently out the door, I really had high hopes for this place. Their food was very good, but it did not live up to the hype and all the ravings from the locals. I feel like briskets are supposed to be the flag ship of any smoke house or barbeque restaurant. Unfortunately, their brisket was about on par with what you would find at just about any barbeque joint. Although it was tasty, it didn't seem to be above average. Now that I'm done ranting about how the product does not match the hype, there are some really good aspects to this restaurant.

All of their food was flavorful and their pit beans are outstanding. I'm conflicted about whether their burnt ends or ribs are better. I think it really comes down to personal preference, but I would have to say the ribs probably win out just a little. 

I love the wide variety of sauces on their menu. If you like spicy, the Ghost Habanero BBQ sauce is probably one of the best on the menu; it is listed under \"extra spicy.\" If you prefer something with less spicy and a ton of flavor, I would recommend the Carolina Vinegar and you also can't really go wrong with the Texas sauce. 

They have a very good selection of beer on tap and whoever chose their selection has great taste. I have to admit, Black Dog sold me on dark beer. I've never really been a fan of dark beer until I tried their Galena Mad Monk. It is a very flavorful beer and has a very nice aftertaste which amplifies the deliciousness of the food. I think the Galena Brewing Company also decided to go \"full Belgian\" on the beer by making it 12% alcohol. I definitely had a nice buzz going by the time I finished my meal and I think the Galena Mad Monk has moved to my list of favorite beers now.

The customer service was great. Our waitress was extremely friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The staff make the restaurant feel very comfortable and relaxing. 

One last little thing that I liked about the restaurant was the bowl which was mounted on a column near the bar; it was painted and had \"El perro negro está aquí\" written along the edges and translates to \"the black dog is (located) here.\" I don't really know why I liked the bowl so much, but it added a certain charm to the restaurant and made it feel more personable. 

Black Dog is definitely one of the better restaurants in the CU area."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in the area. I suggest going with the daily special (love the tacos) or a Pick 2 Platter. Twice baked casserole is always a solid bet for a side. Hardest part is getting in and out quickly, as there is usually a wait... but that goes with the best things in life. Try to get the burnt ends if you can, but they go quickly... and aren't for everyone. Variety of sauces and I will usually pair them with what I'm eating. Turkey = spicy mustard. (rarely used, but delicious)

Enjoy."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I decided to call to see how long the wait would be - about 30 minutes I was told. Well in the end it was closer to an hour for our party of 3, thank goodness you can get a drink while waiting. In the end however it was worth the wait. The service was excellent, fast and efficient. The food arrived promptly and was everything other reviewers had raved about. I had the pulled pork with sweet potato fries and beans, All were excellent. They were out of the burnt rib ends and the daily special by the time we ordered but the rest of the choices were good. A nice selection of beers so no complaints there. It is small and with no reservations I think you will have to be lucky not to wait, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"WOW! I'm not joking, that burnt ends sandwich was definitely one of the best things I've ever ate!!! Had the hot Georgia peach sauce. soooooo good! and just under $10!? What a deal! Kind staff, very aware of the level of need for their patrons. I was new here and the bartenderwaitress was very thorough! 6 stars if I could. Yes, believe the hype! This place is amazing!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food. Had a moment with my Blackdog burger. Would have given it 5 stars but the service was horrible. Every server had a huge attitude, like, I get it- you're cool."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before so this was the second time and I wasn't impressed. This doesn't compare to Texas BBQ so I'm not sure why some reviews say that. The burnt ends weren't anything special, tasted just the moist end of the brisket with some decent bark. The potato casserole was dry and wasn't anything to write home about. The pulled pork was just pulled pork. Brisket was pretty dry and disappointing. The pork ribs and fries were pretty good though."}
{"text":"So we went to black dog to meet our party that was coming into town.  There were going to be 4 of us.  The two of us arrived and wanted to have drinks and order appetizers but the hostess refused to seat us or allow us to sit at the bar. No one was waiting and there were tables open and several bar stools. But we were still not allowed to have a seat.  This is the most ridiculous rule ever when there are obviously spaces available and no one is waiting."}
{"text":"So overpriced and we barely got anything.... And the pit beans I got were hard for some reason. The sauces are still delicious though."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, but it didn't really 'wow' me. Possibly it's because I didn't get the burnt ends, but they were out of that by the time I strolled in on a Saturday night. Wasn't too long of a wait for me, only about 2 couples ahead of me and the gf. Got seated at the bar and had an unfriendly waitress. She just seemed stressed and unhappy. Heard her say to another table that it was a long day, so tried not to bother her with anything. I waited until she left and asked another waitress for a different bbq sauce with my meal ha. Anyway, I ordered the rib tips since they guy next to me got it and it looked delicious. It was alright, nothing crazy. I got one of the vinegar bbq sauces first and didn't like it at all. That's when I got the Georgia one which was a lot better and thicker. The twice baked potato casserole, I think it was called, was delicious. The potato salad was meh, you could probably skip on that. 

The gf got the chicken salad which came with a bunch of crackers. It was a different style on chicken salad so not really sure what to compare it too. It was alright though. We also split some corn bread and that was meh too. I think it was over hyped in my mind from some of these other reviews. Over all it was alright, wasn't too expensive either and you get a pretty decent amount of food. Had to take some home since there was so much so that's always a positive. One day I'll try those burnt ends....one day...."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to eat in Champaign and Urbana. The quality of their meat is great but what really makes the meal is their selection of bbq sauces. I recommend Georgia peach. The free-range pulled chicken sandwich is delicious but pretty much everything I've had doesn't disappoint. The smoked salmon sandwich wasn't as good as everything else but definitely not bad. 

Overall, a great addition to Urbana."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at the Blackdog. The service was very friendly and fast. The only thing better than the service was the food, delicious! If you enjoy barbecue and unique local haunts you owe it to yourself to stop in."}
{"text":"WOWZA! I'm not from CU, but I've been coming here every summer since I was a kid.  My grandparents usually take us somewhere fancy, but I'd rather eat here anytime!  We had fantastic BBQ & service! Since there was a 45 minute wait when we arrived and my grandparents are over 90, the host told us we should walk over to the bar across the street for drinks and he came all the way over there to let us know our table was ready!! Now THAT's service!    Also, I'm from GA and the BBQ here is better than most I've had back home, and that's sayin somethin!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is the best barbeque in the Champaign-Urbana area. The pulled pork sandwich and burnt ends are the greatest things on the menu. If you can, get sweet potato fries. They are also to die for. No reservations, so go at an off time, around 4 and you'll be set without a wait (probably). Try all the sauces! I love the Hot Georgia Peach, but the Carolina Red is always a favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 meat platter.

Pull pork, salmon, and moist brisket for meat. For the sides, I got twice baked potatoes and slaw. 

When they brought the order, the guy told me : \" there's no moist brisket, but here some dripping\". First of all, he lied to my face, I've had moist brisket at numerous BBQ joints and this guy tells me they don't have it? Instead of letting me know and letting me order something else, they brought me DRY briskets and rendered fat to make it \"moist\". 

I can't take this place seriously as a BBQ restaurant. Maybe if you have some alcohol before eating the food, it would not be so disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome place in the middle of downtown Champaign. Came to Champaign on a work assignment in nearby Clinton and came to this establishment to meet some friends. Had the Southern Mango Sour to drink which was just excellent and for an entree had the combo Brisket and Amish Turkey was that was absolutely delicious for a BBQ joint in this area of the Midwest. It definitely lives up to the hype where many were waiting to be seated  because the food is that good. Highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Um...can I start off with stating how amazing our server was??? I didn't catch her name but shes the one with long hair and glasses. Super friendly and amazing. The food was delicious but she made the whole experience there even better! 

My brother went to UofI and he always spoke about how great this place is. I'm from NJ and prior to that San Diego, so I haven't been really around amazing bbq. But let me tell you....this place is BOMB. My parents and I loved it. 

And if burnt ends are still available...order it!!!! It's melt in your mouth goodness. But honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you order here. I got the 2 combo with pork ribs and the meat loaf (it was the special of the day) with collard greens and pit beans. SO GOOD. Im Sal's sting just remembering it. Corn bread was yum too! 

If you're visiting or live in the area, it's a must try. Just keep in mind that there'll prob be a wait for you to get seated. But trust me, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"The inside of the new location is a little more modern and bright compared to the original location. We arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm. There was a line out of the door, but you reserved your spot in line by signing your name via an iPad and entering your phone number. You then get a text when they're ready to seat you. This made a big difference because you can see how many are in front of you in line and the progress being made. This allowed us to go next door to another, less crowded bar, and get some beers for the wait. The food was the same and the service was great."}
{"text":"This place will forever have a specisl time in my heart now. I've been in Urbana-Champaign for one semester and I have been here a total of five times. The service is generally fast and there is at least one waiter that id absolutely hilarious. It is not their fault that there is almost always a wait. If you want a table fast, I recommend showing up after the lunch-rush is over but before the dinner-crowd starts to arrive. The food is spectacular and you will enjoy every bite. I strongly recommend trying the cornbread appetizer. It is heavenly."}
{"text":"It always amuses me how a place becomes the \"In\" spot in town and then shows an arrogance towards its customers that conveys the sense of superiority.  It's like they're doing you a favor by serving you, rather than you doing them a favor by patronizing the place.  It's too bad because the food is good, although not the sublime experience that some people claim.  Yes, the burnt ends are delicious -- if you can ever get them.  Forget about seating.  Forget about customer service. Get take out, if you can find someone who will condescend to wait on you.  For the food I'd give four stars but for the general dining experience, two is the best I can muster.  The beer selection is decent but not spectacular for a true beer lover.  I agree with Dan W.: Good food, bad service."}
{"text":"The bbq here is so amazing. I always get the pulled pork but it has never disappointed. their homemade bbq is also so amazing. The only thing that is unfortunate about the restaurant is that there is always a wait. Don't get me wrong, it is worth the wait I'm just not a very patient person."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for BBQ food in champaign. The first time I ever went to Black Dog was when the location was only in Urbana. It was the worst experience because the place was so small and there was always a wait. 

The new location in Champaign is heaven. It is much bigger than the one in Urbana and I never have to wait more than 10 minutes. I always get a nice beer to start off with, usually something light because I know I am about to stuff my face with BBQ. I always get their pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese and french fries. I change up the type of BBQ sauce that I get all the time because there are so many delicious options to choose from. 

The only reason why I rate it a 4 and not a 5 is because the price. It is a great amount of delicious food but it is priced a little high. For two people ordering a meal it with usually come up to around 50 dollars with a tip. Definitely still worth going to, just can't go there as much as I would like to."}
{"text":"I was a little unsure about trying black dog as the SO and I are very picky about bbq and generally prefer just to bbq at home.  We both absolutely loved black dog!  We had the burnt tips for an appetizer and I was very impressed with the flavor and the tenderness.  I ordered the brisket with their version of Texas bbq sauce and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great smoke ring and flavor with a good portion size.  SO ordered the combo plate of a half slab of spareribs and catfish.  The ribs were seasoned well with a sweet dry rub which is how my SO prefers them.  They were cooked to perfection, tender but not overdone and I got a good crisp bite off the bone.  I didn't care for the catfish as it was smoked however the hubby enjoyed it.  I liked the bbq sauces we had (Texas and sweet Georgia peach) however did not  care for the house bbq sauce.  The side dishes are okay.  I had the Southwest potato salad and it was a different take on traditional potato salad. Atmosphere was great and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable.  I do wish they had more room inside the restaurant however I hear they're opening a second location with more square footage.  Definitely pleased and would have this add a go-to spot to take visitors for bbq."}
{"text":"Black Dog is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area. The ribs are pure perfection and so are the unique sauce parings. The only caveat, and I found this both at the  Champaign and Urbanna location, they tend to run out of their best items very quickly in the night."}
{"text":"I've been to Black Dog on awkward first dates, with a group of people I didn't know, and to lunch with an ex. And yet, I've never had an unpleasant experience at Black Dog. 
The burnt ends are basically legendary. I had never been there early enough to try them until yesterday. Yeah, they're amazing. It's no wonder they sell out before 12:45 pretty much every day. The barbecue is divine, the sauces fiery, the fries crispy, and the beer cold - and all for a terrific price (and friendly service!). Lunch for two with one appetizer, one sandwich, one platter, one soft drink and one beer - $32 before tip, and there were even some leftovers to take home. 
The only downside I can see, other than the occasional out-of-stock menu item, is the seating issue. There's definitely not enough space. However, they do make it fantastically easy to get a meal to-go, plus some relaxing outdoor seating for the warmer months. If you come with a group, make sure everyone is there on time, or you'll be waiting until the last person arrives, and then some. Still - it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Visited in May (disappointment), September (disappointment) and today (disappointment). Do Not Come Here For The Brisket. If you are looking for Beef Brisket in Champaign County go to that place on North Cunningham Avenue. 

I had hi hopes for this establishment based on past experiences in Urbana. Tonight:

Ordered Brisket---they brought pulled pork. NOT LOOKING GOOD. 
Order two sides and only got one.

Then, Now NO cornbread side for the table, (ordered full order for the table).

I am looking at the brisket clearly from a BBQ perspective. I have had a lot of Texas BBQ from the best in Texas. Austin, Lockhart, San Antonio, Houston and If it's SMOKED it should have a smoke ring and 'bark' this clearly does not!

Service was ok, sides were ok, but I do not understand why we continue to experience such mediocre service, food and overall experiences. I will not try again, Three strikes and You are Out!"}
{"text":"Grab the catfish sandwich w/ mustard sauce. Heat on a level of 6/10 which compliments the sandwich & slaw well. Wash down with a Root Wildflower Pale Ale. Staff friendly & welcoming. Nice place to visit while in Champaign/Urbana"}
{"text":"Ribs were fantastic!!  The brisket was very good as well. They were out of the ends, which they are known for. Locals say you have to get there early if you want them. The service was fair. Give yourself plenty of time because they go on a wait quickly. Don't worry, it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Always a wait but well worth it.  Love that the beer selection is always rotating. 

I always order something different and have been pleased and STUFFED each time. 

A MUST go when visiting the champaign/urbana area."}
{"text":"This looks like a local hangout, but it doesn't take away from the outstanding service and Super food! The first thing you notice is a Sign In board to put your name if they are busy. Don't hesitate to add your name.

The brisket is wonderful and smokey, the catfish was tender on the inside with a nice crust on the outside. The pit beans were a bit over powering for me, but the twice baked potatoes were great. If it is your first time get the BBQ sauce flight! 

The whiskey flight is very fun too."}
{"text":"Wait time on a Saturday evening is long, signed onto the board and waited almost 1 hour for dinner.  The place is rather small and service is okay.  They were out of a few items including the beef brisket which I wanted to try.  Ordered the combo platter, which I was expensive ($19) considering the normal-to-small portion size.  The pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends, tasted good but wasn't exceptional. The different sauces were sweet and spicy ($2 for sauce platter).  Carry out would be a better choice if you don't want to wait for a table.  Overall, it was good."}
{"text":"Their pulled pork is DIVINE, very tender and sauced to perfection.  They butter their buns and add some 'slaw in the sandwich.  I gladly had it twice in 3 days.  Like Goldilocks who found the perfect bbq... not too spicy, not too dry, perfectly tangy, the meat was juicy, everything was just right.  And that's why I keep going back.

It's located in an unsuspecting, little brick building but it's packed at meal times throughout the week no matter what day.  They have random pieces of art on the wall I mistakenly took for coat hangers...  but the servers are pretty good at seating you and there's a great atmosphere.  Clients licking their fingers, loving their food, and servers knowing their food is prized.  Don't waste your time on the spicy potato salad, but pair your meal with sweet tea, sweet potato fries or amazing smoked beans.  They don't joke around with their smoked flavor.  I have never tasted such 'smokiness' ever.

They ran out of brisket and the pulled chicken, but i guess that's what happens when everything tastes like home-cooked goodness.  I'll be back very soon to try their rib tips and wings."}
{"text":"Excellent! I've been back more times than I can remember and never been disappointed. But make sure to come before you're hungry because the line is worth it but looong. Don't wear your favorite white sweater either BBQ is messy

The good: sauce samplers (Carolina red!) and anything meat
The not so good: the wait time, the veggie options, and places to wait when it's raining or cold out."}
{"text":"Good BBQ - but just good. Wasn't great. Wasn't bad. Service was okay - food was slow to get out - but - was hot. The sauces are just weird. The only one our family liked was the hot - and it wasn't hot by any way, shape, or form. It was as hot as weak salsa. I would definitely go there again - but - you have to make sure and go when there aren't a bajillion other people - so early afternoon is best. Or you'll have an hour + wait."}
{"text":"Black dog is the best BBQ place I ever went to.

Love the burnt ends."}
{"text":"Why oh why couldn't this place stay a bigger secret?  Everything is delicious, but they really excel at smoking pork.  The pulled pork is great on its own or in a sandwich, and the pork belly is heaven if your arteries can handle more than one bite :).  Unfortunately, they're very crowded a lot of the time and it can get quite noisy inside.  But with food as good as theirs, I'll keep coming back.  Their house BBQ sauce isn't sickly sweet like some other area establishments', but instead is slightly spicy with a vinegar kick (but if you're with silly folks like my  hubs who like a sweeter sauce, don't worry, they've got that too).  Delightful.  Try the smoked sweet potato after 5pm for a special side, it's one of my favorites (and makes especially good take-home leftovers if you are too full after devouring your meats).  Oh, and if you're like me and were used to mixed drinks that come all tricked out with umbrellas and slushy neon coloring, sit down before you order one of theirs.  Their margaritas are delicious, not at all watered-down, and served in a plain old glass.  Knock your socks off yummy and strong.  Their selection of beer is also excellent."}
{"text":"Best sit-down bbq in town. They run out of burnt ends most of the time we go but that's our fault for getting there later in the evening. 
My wife digs the pulled pork and I like pork chops and pit beans."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I enjoyed the burnt tips + potato salad. My friend's sweet potato fries were tasty. Sauce has a good kick! Dine early -  minimum seating."}
{"text":"I think once a place gains a positive national reputation it tends to devolve. Don't get me wrong. I mean, for the area, this is one of the better places to eat. However, each time I eat here the water tastes like chemical waste, the food is good but not stellar, and the software they use for at table orders and payments? Really obnoxious. This place caters to the bro set, but faculty and families also frequent this place. One last thing, I can't tell you how odd it is to move to central Illinois from the deep South to find decent BBQ. Decent, yes, but not great. They get three stars for atmosphere--it's cramped and you often have to wait to be seated, but I always manage to have a good time nonetheless--and for the selection of sauces--omg it's so hard to find sauce in the Midwest!!--and for the menu. The cole slaw is \"German style,\" which means to me \"tasteless and inedible,\" but their baked beans are pretty durn good. I really hate their drink menu. It's definitely for the fraternity set. They should offer at least one upscale cocktail. I get that they are trying to keep with the down home style with mason jars and paper towels on the table instead of napkins, but some of it translates as lazy. Like I said, resting on laurels. I need to write a separate review for their new Champaign location, which is totally sub-par, by the way. If you need BBQ and you are in Chambana, go to this location in Urbana. It will be slightly overpriced and just a tad bit disappointing,  but, really, this is as good as it gets in this area."}
{"text":"Simply put, Black Dog has excellent barbecue. I have yet to try something from the menu that I don't like, and I've actually been pleasantly surprised each time I've tried something new. I usually go for the pulled chicken sandwich (with locally raised, free-range chicken) with Georgia Peach BBQ sauce, and a side of sweet potato fries or pit beans. The chicken has always been incredibly moist, and the peach BBQ is a perfect compliment. Absolutely delicious. I've also tried the brisket, pork tacos, and burnt ends, which were amazing. The sides have also all been delicious, from the corn bread to the spicy potato salad.

In addition to the food, the selection of beer on tap is typically pretty varied and affordable. I almost always get a beer with my meal...well, when I'm not feeling too cheap, that is. ;)

The only thing that hasn't been consistently good is the service. Don't get me wrong, it's never been bad, per se. They've always been very friendly, but the waitstaff gets easily overwhelmed. So, if it's busy (which it will be around lunch time and early evening), just be patient and don't be afraid to get someone's attention if you feel you're not being noticed.

If you love barbeque and supporting awesome local businesses, you should definitely give Black Dog a go."}
{"text":"The service wasn't the best even though it was a Tuesday night and it was not packed. The servers weren't the most hospitable and that really matters when I'm spending my money. Since it was a \"one night only\" affair I indulged in the rib tips - big accident. Gross and waaaaaaaaaaay too much fat. Not the kind of rib tips I'm used to. I think asked for the actual ribs of the pig and they were ok. The rub was not impressive, the meat did not fall off the bones, and the sauce was nothing special. I guess Chicago kicks butt for ribs because Urbana, IL is highly overrated. I've seriously had better."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed, but we were seated pretty quickly. We were sat at the bar and our waitress was wonderful her name was Candace and she was just so delightful one of the best servers I've had in a while. We order wings for our appetizer and we received them quickly and they were delicious. I got the combo plater with the polish sausage and 1/4 rip and it was great. Will come back again a great night out."}
{"text":"There seems to be a unanimous vote for Black Dog as the best restaurant in Chambana... I'm sorry but I don't see it. 

I've been there over a dozen times and the only item on the menu I LOVED was the cornbread (full of pulled pork) -- Delicious!!! Everything else is just \"meh\". This is descent BBQ, but I definitely wouldn't say it's amazing or anything. As a matter of fact, their burgers and most side-dishes are absolutely a waste of money! Also, I've tried all of their BBQ sauces and the only one I really liked was the sweet GA peach, the rest are not that good.

I was a bit torn on how to rate this restaurant -- they have descent BBQ, I absolutely love the cornbread, but I hate waiting in line, and I find their snooty \"we're the best restaurant in town\" attitude EXTREMELY off-putting!"}
{"text":"Eh, the sauce is the only draw for me.  Other than that, meat is par to sub-par as far as flavor, texture, cook, smoke, etc."}
{"text":"This is a great mom-n-pop shop in Urbana for BBQ. Get there early, or they will run out of their burnt ends, chicken, and rib tips.

I really enjoyed my waitress- she was hilarious! I said I wanted water (it was lunch on a work day), and she said, \"okay, vodka on the rocks!\" She didn't have any recommendations, other than for the Cuban sandwich. Not being a big fan of those sandwiches in general, I opted for the beef brisket sandwich with slaw and sweet potato fries. I chose the Carolina Red sauce.

I loved the sandwich and the fries- the cole slaw wasn't anything special. The sauces are delicious and unique. They do have a decent list of craft beer too!!"}
{"text":"I've tried other BBQ places around town, since I grew up in the area, and Black Dog is the best around. 

My suggestion would be the cornbread (filled with green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork) and the burnt ends sandwich. If you've read a lot of reviews about this place, you're probably already curious about these \"burnt ends\" people talk about. Black Dog cuts off the point of a brisket that has been smoked for 12 hours, cover it in dry rub again, then smoke for an additional 12 hours. There isn't a lot, so if I'm craving this sandwich, I go right at the opening because it's sure to run out fast.

They have a variety of sauces, which is great for those who like tang, spicy, sweet, etc. As for the beer, I hear there's a lot of great ones there, but I've never ordered one myself. (I'm not really a 11am drinker.)

However, be warned -- it is a SMALL and popular place, so there's bound to be a wait. This isn't something I'd take a star off though because I always get great food and I like the atmosphere. When a place is that busy in a part of Urbana people can't even see easily from the main road, it's a good sign the food is great. If you just want to try it, go at 11am when they open or call ahead and order out."}
{"text":"Excellence BBQ.  Applesauce and green beans as the sides were just as good as the ribs and brisket. Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Easily the best barbeque place if you don't mind the wait to get a table. Once seated service is very quick as most BBQ places are.

The ambience is great but the reason this place is packed is because the food is unreal."}
{"text":"Good stuff. If you like barbeque this is the place to be. The new restaurant is terrific as well."}
{"text":"Portions are super small and would not fill you up if you have a huge appetite. The waiter was named candy. She was nice to me. I had pulled pork and the beef brisket with the side of sweet potato and the cornbread. Honestly it was not the best BBQ I've ever eaten before."}
{"text":"The food and beer are really good.  As stated in many other reviews, this place is really small. Prices are pretty reasonable.  The smoked catfish and sweet potato fries were just smokey and soft.  The beer sampler is worth a try. There is a good selection of stouts if you like them.  This place is a must visit if you are in the Champaign-Urbana area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  The wait to get a table is horrible!  And the service sucks!  Continuously, I've found this to be true. The only thing saving this place is the amazing food!  It's wonderful!  It's so good that it makes up for the crappy service and the 30 minute wait for a table. It doesn't matter what you order....it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This is quite literally the worst barbecue I've had. I've tried it two or three times now, and it has not change my Pinyan at all. The first on the brisket was extremely tough and flavorless, and the second time the brisket was soft and moist, but it still flavorless.
 The meat is not something that you want here, but their vegetable dishes are not bad at all and I think they're fairly interesting. The staff is attentive, nice, and one of the best things about their establishment."}
{"text":"Here we go again. The best part about work travel is they pick up the tab!

Anyhow... By looking at the exterior of this place I would have never guessed it to harbor a BBQ-haven within. I arrived in on a rainy early afternoon and was surprised to see still a bit of a crowd. In hindsight, this is probably a sign that the Urbana folk love this place- and warranted.

I was promptly seated at the bar and happy to see that they have an EXPANSIVE option of bourbon and rye to choose from; even some high quality stuff like Bookers. Additionally they had a good handful of on-tap options covering a variety of beer types. 

The bartender wasn't the warm and fuzzytype, however he was very prompt, attentive, and professional. 

I opted for the combo of two; 1/4 rack of ribs and beef brisket. For sides, corn bread and twice baked mashed potatoes. I'll have to say each were very flavorful with thee own unique taste. These both are definitely someone's home receipe and I approve. The cornbread itself is hearty and flavorful enough to TRUELY qualify as a side.

Overall this is a great place without the steep price you generally run accross in a BBQ joint (that's including the bourbons). The quality to price ratio definitely leaves the patron winning in this transaction. Well don't Black Dog.... Well done."}
{"text":"I have been to the Urbana location multiple times and thought I would venture to the newer champaign one. The wait was a little shorter because the place is larger, but still had very little waiting room for the amount of people.

We ordered the burnt ends appetizer which was delicious, definitely meant for 2-3 people though! The portion was pretty small. I then had a pulled pork sandwich and the twice baked casserole on the side, both are my usuals and I love them every time! 

Things started slowing down around 1:30pm, so if you are ever looking for a good lunch with no wait try to go around that time."}
{"text":"Great variety of options, freshly made and a good price."}
{"text":"People in Urbana drool over this place.. I think it's pretty good but a bit overpriced. The quality of their food is good and their sauces are good as well, although less than a block away you will try the best BBQ sauce in the 217 area which is the lil porgys. Although black dogs does have better quality of food than lil porgys. This place is good and it has even been on tv for a must try place in Urbana. I don't think it's worth all that hype, but it is a good BBQ place.. although now everyone is going to the location in champaign, so this place will not have those super long lines it used to have."}
{"text":"Tender and flavorful. Nice ambience and down to earth servers. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"A good place to eat but a little pricey and not sure I cared for the food i ate.  Maybe another menu choice would have been better.  Not certain I would choose going in there over the other restaurants after my experience there.  Just so so, I guess.  I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, out of burnt ends every time I visit but very delicious none the less. I tried smoked chex mix which was better than I expected. Always worth the wait. Must try their meat!"}
{"text":"The meat is so tender and packed with flavor! Very delicious. 

The setting is nice, waiter was very friendly and helpful. There will definitely be a line though, so get there early and put your name down; they can call you when you're at the front of the list!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing smoked meats. My husband and I ordered different meat. He got pork and I got beef and everything was delicious with generous side portions. Tender and flavorful. The staff was polite and friendly. I will definitely be going back again and again........"}
{"text":"Bad experience!
Food tasted okay. But that's about it.
It's way too over-priced. The portions are shockingly tiny. Why would I pay 10 bucks for a small sandwich which I can pretty much put together at home?
Polite service, I'll give them that.
Pathetic inventory issues, they were out of most things by 9 on a Friday night.
Beer was bad, not worth the price.
Ambience is nothing special, casual. The place is small. If you're going as a group of 7-8, they will make you split into 2 groups.

Go to DESTIHL instead. Better food. Better portions. MUCH better ambience. Better beer. More options for craft beer for cheaper."}
{"text":"We need a Black Dog in Indy! Stopped here for lunch while traveling for bidness. Wednesday Special is a delicious Cuban sandwich. Bread was crusty outside, tender inside. They don't skimp on the filling...pork was perfect and the housemade pickles added a tasty crunch. You can never go wrong with 2x baked potato casserole in a tiny rameken. Piping hot, crispy top, satiny smooth inside. Day beering is a plus and the tap selection didn't disappoint...neither does the bourbon list, but I declined. LOL"}
{"text":"I adore Black Dog. If not for the health concerns, I would have eaten here every week when I was on campus. I would definitely go for the burnt ends, but they sell like hot cakes, so make sure you get there early or order ahead of time.

I was interviewing the owner and staff for an article, and everyone was beyond passionate about their food. As I was taken back to see the smoking rack, I was happy to see the staff joking and laughing with each other. They seemed so at ease and seemed to enjoy their work. From the bartenders to the wait staff to the chefs, everything is bar none here. It shows in the quality of the bbq and the excellent drink recommendations made.

I've seen people get the whiskey fleet and be awed by the beautiful presentation. Plus, there's nothing better than a spot of whiskey, burnt ends, pulled pork, mashed potatoes and some sweet potato fries. Better hit the gym afterwards, but you know it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"I just revisited, and I had a great experience! I ordered the burnt ends sandwich and cornbread. The sandwich was great and the sauce variety is awesome. My friends and I all got different sauces and tried one another's. Carolina Red, the house sauce, and Chipotle were my favorites. I would also highly recommend the cornbread - it has pulled pork in it!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a local, and i was only in town for a day. We ordered for pick up, which was bittersweet. We got food right away (it was packed, and we probably would have had to wait if we ate in), but missed out on their fancy beer selection. 

Anyway, at first glance, it looked like the portions were very small, but then some of us had trouble finishing. The brisket was the big favorite. Very impressed with the Texas sauce and the mustard. We also liked that they smoked the bleu cheese for the wings. I wish now that i had popped for burnt ends, and saved them for lunch the next day. ( we had enough leftovers for a snack for two, maybe 3)

They were out of the famous twice baked side, and we were in a hurry, so instead of waiting, we ended up with surprisingly good fries, Mac and cheese that i think was also smoked, and made with a cheese we liked but could not identify (white), and some okay potato salad. 

The place isn't fancy, and not expensive, and probably no good for a first date, but for a regular guilty pleasure, or just casual get togethers with the gang, it's perfect. We spent less than $20/person, and had way too much food for a single sitting) Could have just had the combo platters, which are like $14."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing. Small place so it can be a  long wait sometimes but it is so worth it. Food comes very fast. If they still have burnt ends when you're there, get them!!! This is the type of place that you stop for if you're passing through town. Everything is so good and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I was in Champaign for the high school state wrestling this past weekend and was recommended to check this place out.  I was not let down.  The restaurant is small and homey and you write your own name down on the whiteboard to get in line for a table.  

 My table had the blackdog cornbread for an app which has pieces of pulled pork and jalapeno in it- very tasty.  For the entree I had the brisket and pulled pork with sides of beans and the twice baked potato casserole.  The brisket was solid.  The pulled pork had good flavor but was a tad dry, a little disappointing.   The beans were very tasty though, and the twice baked potato casserole was amazing.  I also tried my fellow diners mac n cheese, and it was great.  The sides really shined during my visit.  There are lots of different styles of bbq sauce to choose, there's something for everyone. Staff was attentive and pleasant, definitely coming back next time I'm down in Champaign!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a couple days ago.  When people told me about there being a big line at the door, they weren't lying.  We were expecting 5 people to show for dinner and so I signed the paper at the front for 5.  When one didn't show up the waitress informed me that everyone needed to be present in order to be seated and that nobody could join your table at a later time.  

On to the food:  I had the beef brisket platter with corn bread and their beans.  Both sides were absolutely amazing.  I tried a little of my sister's potato salad...I think and it was great as well.  As far as the brisket goes, I kind of expected it to be seasoned better.  It was very tender and perfectly cooked but I thought it would have seasoning aside from the BBQ sauce served in a separate dipping cup.  

All things considered I give the food as a whole 4.5 stars, the service gets 3.5 stars because the waitress seemed a bit short when she stated the seating policy.  True there was a sign at the front, but I didn't see it because the place was crowded.  Maybe put multiple signs up.  Please hurry and get your second location going!"}
{"text":"Eclectic and trendy place. Seems to always be busy, according to those who took us there. The burnt ends beef brisket sandwich that I had was a ten star sandwich, the meat was cooked perfectly - you can tell they know bbq. My wife had the chicken breast sandwich and it was a little pink, but delicious. 
The cole slaw was a different story. I think that runny, tart, vinegar based slaw is a thing, but it was awful. It tasted bad, and the cut of the cabbage was horrible. If they would have made the cuts long and slender, instead of square, small and chunky, it would have been a different experience.
Our server, Isaiah was one of the best, other servers jumped in to offer refills when they noticed drinks low and the hostess was very friendly. The entire staff was a 10, so absolutely no issues there."}
{"text":"We loved it.  Some if the best BBQ ever.  The corn bread was tops and the slaw tasty.  My wife is a vegetarian and when we discovered the corn bread and red beans and rice both have meat, the server could not have been more accommodating.  The beer selection is great and our meal was only $35 for two (and that's with two drinks each).  I may go back tomorrow for lunch!

Late addition.  We went back and had another great experience.  This place is the bomb"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ I have ever tasted. The price is a bit expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. Out of all the times I've been there, they are always out of the burnt ends. I believe they usually run out of those within an hour of opening, so come early if you want to try them. Overall, really tasty and juicy BBQ!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and was full on a Monday night! Their service is really great as well. As of this point the apple maps pin location is a bit off so be observant!!"}
{"text":"One of my top three c/u restaurants. I admit I am not a BBQ connoisseur. I am only familiar with Memphis BBQ, but the last time I was in Memphis, I was wishing I was at Black Dog. I used to be crazy about their cole slaw, but in the past year or two the recipe seems to have changed. I will still get it on a sandwich, but not as a side also. The first time I went here was a friday night in Nov 2008 and I think there were three occupied tables in the whole place. Now, you should definitely plan on a wait for pretty much any night of the week. That is frustrating if you show up hungry but it's also part of the charm and quaintness of the restaurant. Lunch time is not quite as busy, but still busy during lunch rush. I appreciate the addition of a couple veggie options on the menu (portabello sandwich and grilled cheese). Great addition to the area and excited to hear they are opening another location. Since I've moved out of town I really miss this place :("}
{"text":"Their barbeque is the best in town. Everything they make is freshly made from scratch, even the tasty lemonade. In addition to the barbeque, I like the potato casserole and the corn bread with pork inside. I usually order my food to go since it is a popular restaurant and if you plan to eat there at dinner time, you will have to wait a very long time."}
{"text":"I am yet to meet somebody who doesn't LOVE Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. This little hole in the wall packs genuine barbeque cuisine unlike anywhere in the vicinity of C-U. Yes, you may have heard it's a small restaurant with a perpetually long wait, but it's worth walking around adorable downtown Urbana for awhile before you're seated. I've also done a carry-out with several other people which only took about 25 minutes to prepare.

There's a variety of BBQ sauces from mild to hot listed and detailed on the menu. My personal favorite is the Texas Sauce; it has that smoky flavor I expect out of Midwestern Barbeque. Also, you haven't really lived until you've tried the brisket sandwich.

As for side dishes, my friends and I swear by the Twice Baked Potato Casserole. The sweet potato fries are irresistibly sweet and caramelized. Overall, Black Dog provides a one of a kind cuisine. 

Also VEGETARIANS-- there are some delicious options for you, too."}
{"text":"So everyone told me this was the best place to go when I visited the area. And I really want to give 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I rounded down mainly because the brisket we got really was dry....and for a BBQ place with that much hype I was really kind of sad inside to get dry brisket...

WE REALLY wish we had gotten the burnt ends, but they were sold out by the time we got seated...next time and I am sure that would have caused me to round up instead of down from 3.5 stars...

The cornbread with pork in the cornbread, however, is genius! So so good and it added a little more moisture. I definitely need to try making it that way at home. And the pulled pork was also decent especially paired with one of their sweeter BBQ sauces that we got. The catfish was probably my favorite though which is surprising since I don't even normally order fish at a BBQ place, but here I was and I had heard it was good, and it actually was pretty good!

The mac and cheese was only okay as well in my obsessiveness over anything with cheese and in particular mac and cheese, but the cornbread and catfish were the winners for me!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best barbecues I've ever been to. If the burnt ends are counted you know they've got to be amazing. From the meat to the selection of sauces everything was incredible. The only \"okay' thing: the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my husband and two daughters, ages 3 and 6, on our way from San Antonio to Chicago. This was one of the best meals/experiences of my life. It is very casual, like an amalgam of a bar and diner, yet welcoming to kids. Very limited seating. We arrived at 5:30 and it was perfect. Ten minutes later and we would have been waiting. When we left at 6 30 there were many waiting for a table. We take our kids with us everywhere we can and don't expect the restaurant to cater to them, especially when traveling. The staff was kind and welcoming, albeit not overly friendly like we find in Texas, which was good with us. Our server recommended the wildflower WPA (beer) for me and it was wonderful. I had the chicken salad sandwich, the girls had grilled cheese and my husband had the burnt ends sandwich with baked beans. All were phenomenal.  Very simple presentation, very complex and interesting flavors. We are from Texas and have had more than our fair share of BBQ and this was the best we've ever had. I would absolutely recommend this place if you are looking for a dive bar/diner feel with better beer, delicious food and patrons of all ages."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had, everything else I try across the country just fails in comparison. Casual and welcoming environment. The staff is wonderful and the infused liquor is delish. Anytime the husband and I visit IL, this place is an absolute \"must\"."}
{"text":"Your place was recommended to me, I'm from Az. Pork spareribs, melt I. Your mouth. Twice baked potato casserole yummy and their cornbread great."}
{"text":"The problems I listed in my last review with the dodgy sweet (now called \"Georgia Peach\") bbq sauce and the sweet tea have been corrected. That means my review is now all good!  Feel free to order it sweet."}
{"text":"Rad spot. Pulled pork, smoked wings, and cornbread, and sauces were great. Brisket was okay. Solid beer menu. Good service and good prices. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Picked up a order everything was cold they didn't put coleslaw on sandwiches as advertised I called talked to manager he hung up on me...."}
{"text":"I love Bbq and I judge a place by what I smell before I walk in and this morning and I wasn't disappointed.   The smell of Bbq filled the air.   We walked in and the place was small.  There is outdoor seating (u have to order and then take it outside with you).


We ordered the St. Louis style ribs and the Texas burger. My son finished off the ribs and wouldn't share as it was good.   My burger had brisket on it and it was some of the best brisket I have had.   I wished I had not had the sauce on the burger which took away the smoky goodness.


The only negatives was the service was just the okay and the portions were smaller than many other Bbq joints I have been too.

I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious, I know the line and wait is super long but that doesn't matter when the food tastes so good! Always get Pork ribs and order a platter of sauce because I can never decide on what sauce I like best, but I'm getting there! I also love the two sides, fills you up with delicious and fairly healthy food. I highly recommend this as your go to Barbecue restaurant."}
{"text":"Damn this place is good. Stopped in right at 11 for opening and people were waiting outside. Tables filled up by 11:15. Burnt ends are unreal, prices are great, and place is casual and comfortable."}
{"text":"This was a great find; knew that the minute we walked in and smelled the BBQ! It's the type of place that is equal parts family friendly and a good place to go out at night. Good beer list and the menu is really enticing. My vegetarian daughter had a few options and one of them was the most delicious smoked salsa and house made tortilla chips that were absolutely awesome - light and crispy. I had a combo platter with hot polish sausage - grilled - and pulled pork. Loved the Georgia peach and the mustard (good heat) bbq sauces. The twice baked potato casserole was really flavorful, creamy, and had a crisp on top that was perfect. The succotash was a light and fresh side to complement everything else but lacked a little something - maybe even just salt. We will be back to try something else on the menu next time we come through the area."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Great draft beers on tap. I had the beef brisket and burnt ends combo with cornbread and twice baked potato salad, The meats were both delicious and tender. I had the yummy sweet Georgia bbq sauce. The cornbread is really unique and quite tasty. Very busy and small seating area so plan your trip there accordingly."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab dinner! I would definitely recommend it to all my friends and fam. Georgia was my server and she was great! She very helpful and patient and checks on frequently throughout your meal!!"}
{"text":"Have always loved black dog but very disappointed tonight. Ordered online.. Very user friendly. However when I arrived home I noticed the bag of food had leaked grease onto my car seat. They really need to put the food in plastic containers not wrapped in paper. The fries have always been the best.. Crunchy but soft..tonight they were undercooked and soggy. And lastly the best wings in town were not.. Burnt and dry!! What is going on Black Dog??"}
{"text":"I was here a couple months ago and it was my first visit. Nice date night lol. It was yummy! The spicy green beans were one of the sides and I was so sad I didn't get them so I had to eat most of the boyfriends haha!! I'm glad he likes to share! I had the pork and twice baked potato casserole and enjoyed both. Loved the Georgia peach bbq sauce cause I like it sweet and spicy and it's both. The cole slaw was nice too!"}
{"text":"The Black Dog has great food, great beer, and a great atmosphere.  Unfortunately, everyone in town is in on the secret.  Do not go here if you are in a hurry or looking for a quiet place to take your date.   Go here only if you are willing to sacrifice a little convenience in order to gorge yourself on some of the best food in town.   

There doesn't seem to be a weak spot on the Black Dog's menu.  As other people have mentioned, the pulled pork is exceptional, but right now I'm hung up on the free-range Amish chicken.  Whether you get it as a breast or as a thigh and a wing, you won't be disappointed.  It is moist, succulent, and pairs well with their homemade sauce.        

In my experience, the service is pretty good given the circumstances.  Yes, you will have to wait fifteen minutes to a half hour to get a seat, but eventually your turn will come.  Moreover, since it's a barbecue joint, it doesn't take too long for your food to come after that.  The restaurant would probably benefit from an expansion or a move to a larger location, but for food this good, I'm willing to brave a short wait for the time being."}
{"text":"This place is ok, I don't get all the rave reviews!!! Service was kinda bad, and it's too darn small in there ( I felt like it was a complete fire hazard).  The most troubling thing that I experienced was the gentleman working behind the bar go and grab a handful of cornbread concotion (with NO GLOVES ON) and put in on someones tray!!! I looked down at my cornbread concotion and push it away! Just wrong! and Hickory Rivers' pulled pork is soooo much better than this place!"}
{"text":"Good food with solid portions, great friendly staff. It's in a nice clean neighborhood and has a very friendly atmosphere. If I'm in the Urbana/Champaign again I'll stop in there again."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town. Im a beef brisket fan (get it lean, its even better), the cole slaw, and the pitted beans. My friend always gets the Texas Burger with Swiss cheese added and loves it. 
Plus, now you can get the smoked sweet potato at ANY time of the day in the Champaign location"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in the area. Barbecue isn't plain burgers as many seem to thing. It's pulled pork, brisket, and chicken and Black Dog EXCELS in these three foods. Some of the best pork and brisket I have ever had, and their sauces are all really different and delicious. 
Seriously, you need to try it!

Tip: getting it carry out is super quick."}
{"text":"Look, you can't go wrong with Black Dog. The meats, sauces, and sides are great. I can't recommend this place enough. If you're in the CU, go check one of the two locations out. 

My review is more for the management staff. The hostess seemed a bit lost. She was working behind the bar and hosting, and didn't seem to know where she should be. Then, waitress was slamming drinks down on the table and generally didn't seem happy to be there. These things don't usually bother me, and maybe the staff was having an off day, but I thought it'd be helpful to know."}
{"text":"We are here for lunch and it was quite good. We ordered some flights of beer to sample the good variety that they had. I was very pleased with the beer choices. Then we ordered an appetizer of burnt ends. The burnt ends were very good but we were disappointed with the portion size. The server said it was a 4 oz size. I literally could have shoved the entire appetizer (all 3 little tiny pieces of meat) into my mouth at one time - no problem. I really hate when restaurants get skimpy!

So We ordered pulled pork sandwiches snd they were good. We have previously ordered the platters and really liked them. I recommend spending a little more $ and getting the platters so you don't leave hungry. All in all, the meal was quite good but we left hungry after spending $50 for lunch for just two people."}
{"text":"Pro: Excellent food! I've been here several times and tried a variety of dish's they offer, its been great every time. I have also ordered meat (by the pound) to-go for office luncheons and everyone loves it.

Con: The wait can be quite long and sometimes they run out of menu items. Not very convenient for groups over 6."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, very consistent with the Urbana location. Each time I've been here there has been a wait, but usually short. The menu has expanded slightly and they are usually out of several items by dinner time, but no matter what I've ended up ordering I've been very happy!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Tried the smoked almonds about a year ago on a whim and now I'm hooked! Love the atmosphere and the food is stellar. Seriously, try the almonds."}
{"text":"Black Dog is pretty tasty, although in my experience, they're still working otu the kinks, so you'll have to deal with their occasional running out of food you might like.

Still, the drink selection is nice, and good God, the pulled pork was tasty.  The pit beans were phenomenal.  Personally, I'd recommend getting the coleslaw on the side--and then not eating it.  That wasn't so good, but everything else was.

And sweet Mary and Joseph--CORNBREAD WITH MEAT IN IT.

Yes.  UH. MAY. ZING.

The wait staff is friendly and personable, and the food is top notch.  My only other complaint would be the lack of fried catfish 6 out of 7 days.  Oh, they have regular catfish, but it's only fried on Fridays.  And that just breaks my heart.  Because I LOVE fried catfishy.  DOn't judge me.

Tasty, tasty catfish. 

Anyhow, Black Dog is worth a stop, they've definitely renovated and improved the former space, and the food is great."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday recently. He had never been and I said he had to go. We got here at 6 and only waited about 15 minutes. 

They still had everything on the menu and so we both ordered burnt ends and we both had never had it. Every time I had come they had run out, so I was ecstatic. The food came and I'm in love with their burnt ends. We enjoyed it and the service was great. 

I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"I gained 5 lbs. eating here over the summer.  The drawbacks are that they are often busy and you have to wait for a while to be seated.  Their corn is delicioso!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I won't be around the area... and this may be one of the reasons why. A great place to meet with people and enjoy some great BBQ food.

My favorites are definitely the burnt end and pork belly sandwiches and the sweet potato fries (which costs a little extra). The burnt ends just melt in your mouth. If you want to try more meats and want to share with friends getting a platter is also a great choice. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL! Every time I go I try to get something different and every time it is amazing! Their popular pulled pork is always a must. It pairs well with the Carolina Red (which I'm pretty sure is also their popular bbq sauce). And if you get in early enough, their burnt ends are a definite. My favorite night is Tuesday because they have a special of their homemade artichoke dip and their house-seasoned tortilla chips are fantastic! The artichoke dip is smoked and cheesy and pairs well with the crispy tortilla chips. It's busy but definitely worth the wait. I can't wait for their second location to open. At their current location, I wouldn't try going with more than 5 people ever, and even 5 is hard during rush hour."}
{"text":"I've been to the old place many a times. Coming from Chicago, putting your name down and waiting 30+ minutes is completely normal so when I got to a small town and found myself waiting for a table I knew this place would be amazing. Thankfully though, they found a second home! I was able to visit in the afternoon, parking was easy; the lot is huge. And they had all the favorites.

Of course just like the original location, there can only be so much before it's gone (*cough* burnt ends *cough*). I got there mid afternoon and they was even gone. If you're a FIRST TIMER, I highly recommend any of the following:
* burnt ends
* pulled pork sandwich
* twice baked potato casserole
* sweet potato fries
* (on Tuesdays) the artichoke dip!!!! Yum!

Oh and you really can't go wrong with the sauces, but my favorite is the hot Georgia peach. I usually ask for two on the side so I can dip my sandwich and fries in it! Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to try if you are visiting Champaign and like meat platters. I had the three-combo with burnt ends, pulled pork, and beef brisket. Get there early (right after 5pm) if you want to get the burnt ends as they run out quickly."}
{"text":"Smoked catfish with Carolina BBQ, cole slaw, sweet potato fries and a Central Water Red Ale...delicious! The atmosphere was perfectly casual too"}
{"text":"We are spoiled by Black Dog barbeque.

The one in Champaign has changed their specials compared to the Urbana one, which I think is great! More variety, but still has the awesome staples like burnt ends.

Highly recommend the burnt ends, rib tips, and duck when they have it, although I think the duck is now only available at the Urbana location.

Definitely the best barbeque in C-U and possibly competing for the best in the country. (Named 2nd in the country by Maxim and Fox in 2013)."}
{"text":"I mean BEST bbq in the world... and I have eaten a lot of bbq in my day.  You have to wait to be seated and the place is always jammed. No reservations friends but I'll tell ya it's always worth the wait.  Can't wait you say... too hungry? Okay then call in your order and pick it up.  Black dog tastes just as good on your couch. Also little pearl of wisdom here... in a bind for Dad's weekend and don't want to fight the crowds?  Or for graduation?  Black dog caters (sort of).  Just call ahead and order what ever you need.  Then skip all the waiting and drive up to the back door at which point they will load pounds of meat and yummy yummy food into your car.  Best decision I ever made for Dad's weekend was ordering food from Black dog."}
{"text":"I had the Texas burger and the brisket was perfect. One of my daughters said the grilled cheese was the best she had ever had. Service is my only complaint. We weren't in a super big hurry, but the waitress definitely had too much work to give us enough attention."}
{"text":"Liked the crafts and ordered the mixed platter. Recommend pit beans as side and the beef is more delicious than pork."}
{"text":"The reviews here are correct.  The food here is amazing.  The service is just fine.  Some of the best bbq I've ever had.  It's a little on the pricy side and portions could be a smidge more generous, but if you want a great bbq experience, look no further.  Pick your times carefully if you want to avoid long waits, because Black Dog is popular and not very big.  It's smallish size is part of its charm.

There are lots of great barbecue options in Champaign-Urbana, but this one tops them all."}
{"text":"I like barbeque. I'm also from the south. This makes me very picky about what I consider to be good barbeque, which consists of pork and sometimes chicken. \"Barbequed\" beef brisket is an abomination no matter how much shills from Texas claim it's real barbeque. Since I spent most of my childhood in North Carolina vinegar based sauces are what I grew up with, very different from the ketchup based sugar laden sauces found commonly in the midwest.

Which is why Black Dog is probably the best BBQ place in the Midwest- yes, even better than the overrated and overhyped Oklahoma Joe's franchises in Kansas City.

First off- I really dig the new Champaign location, which according to other reviewers used to be a train station. It's a large enough feeding trough to accommodate the busiest of rushes, much unlike their original Urbana location which could feel cramped around lunch and dinner. 

The meat here is fantastic. Get the burnt ends if they are available. They are perfectly cooked to melt in your mouth, with just the right amount of fat to make it a rich experience without it being cloying or greasy. Other delicious items include their ribs and rib tips, as well as the pulled pork.

What they really excel in are their varied sauces, from the abovementioned sugar sauces favored in the midwest, to a georgian peach variant as well as my favorite carolina sauce with a vinegar and mustard base. No other BBQ place I've been to in the midwest has come close to replicating the childhood nostalgia of drenching a pulled pork sandwich in a spicy, tangy vinegar bbq sauce. While I was eating a single tear rolled down my cheek and my mouth waters at the thought of it. 

The sides here are far from an afterthought too. Their seasoned french fries have just the right amount of salt and crunch to make them the first side to disappear if shared with others. The southwest potato salad packs a wallop in terms of heat and works perfectly with the rich, smoky BBQ. 

Oh and one last thing. They also serve Cheerwine, truly the nectar of the gods and soda of kings. 

If you're ever in Champaign, you owe it to yourself to go to Black Dog and eat until you get the meat sweats."}
{"text":"Black Dog is always on my list of places to go to when back in Champaign-Urbana. Expect a wait, but the food is definitely worth it. Try a drink at the bar while you wait. They almost always have several delicious brews to choose from. 

My favorite items on their menu are the burnt ends (come early, they run out fast), the brisket and the potato casserole. The cornbread is also tasty. The burnt ends and brisket are both melt in your mouth tender and the carolina red sauce mixed with the georgia peach makes for a great combo. It's a little bit greasy, but not too much so.

The service is usually great but if I was to critique anything it would be their seating policy. That you must have 100% of your party to be seated even if it has no impact on what table youll go to (think 3 of 4 people or 5 of 6 people) and even if you plan on ordering drinks / apps is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. I assumed they'd fix that after opening their second location, but they decided to keep it...

If you're in town and dont mind a 30 min wait or so, I highly recommend it. Just make sure you've got your whole party present..."}
{"text":"Just opened today at 11am in the \"Old, Old Train Station:\" the much anticipated Champaign edition of Black Dog Smoke and Ale House! At least for now it has the same menu and phone number as the Urbana location. And it is as good or even slightly better than the food at the Urbana location. Of course, time will tell. They could be putting in greater effort on their opening day. 

If you like smoked food, this is the place. Personally, can take or leave the sauces, although I do like the MIlo's Mustard BBQ Sauce that both places usually have. My brisket was fall-apart tender but nice and juicy, with a lot of smoke and char flavors. I had the smoked cornbread and the smoked greens, both of which were excellent.

The ambiance, for now, leaves a lot to be desired as the dining areas remain under construction.  So, at present, it is take out only. Which is OK, as the Urbana location is so popular and crowded we find it is best described as \"take out mostly.\" Once they finish remodeling the 1800's vintage train station they will have plenty of seating, and they hope to relieve some of the congestion at their Urbana location. They claim-- but who knows-- that it will be finished and the dining room open by August, in time for school to begin.  Until then, hours at this location are limited to 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday and, as I said, it is take out only. Also, the menu is the same as in Urbana.  Once the new location of El Maize opens next door in the merely \"Old Trainstation,\" this will be quite the delicious corner of town. 

This Black Dog has parking! It is on the east side of the restaurant. A real plus compared to the Urbana location.

So far, this is a great addition to our little town. It will be crowded, I am sure, for Graduation weekend, so you might delay your visit until next week (unless you are in town just for graduation), after which things should go more quickly and smoothly.  That said, my order was quick and perfect!  No complaints there at all.  The line was about 35 minutes when I joined it and looked to be twice as long as I left; word was getting around quickly!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is probably one of my five favorite places in the country. I'm partial to the pulled pork and the twice baked for the side, but everything is good....if I'm feeling really saucy I'll get the Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pulled pork on it. That's right. 

I love they're constantly rotating beers, and offer flights for you to try. Yeah, it's always busy and the place is small. It's busy because it's the best."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Great beer.  Service was excellent.  Had a great time.  Give them a try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love the bbq here. By far the best in Champaign area. I had bbq in Austin & St. Louis and this bbq is not like those. BUT I think this is as good as it can get in central IL.

Get Burnt Ends, people love it.
Sweet potato fries are must.
I love corn bread here as an appetizer. It has pulled pork and pit beans and so good when it's hot.

Expect a long way. I suggest going really early or really late."}
{"text":"Great place in a college town! The wait was pretty long but worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ. Excellent food and service.
However this place is always packed. there is always a wait, but not many great BBQ places around the area like this one."}
{"text":"Black Dog is THE best barbecue place in CU area, and I hear it's voted best in Illinois/Midwest by different websites. Their duck platter is awesome and so is the beef brisket and all their burgers. This place knows how to BBQ and they don't try to fluff it up with unnecessary sides that mask the taste. Also, if you've never had their sweet potato fries you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Brisket was amazing. Loved the Carolina red sauce. Also had the smoked artichoke dip which was great. Service was also amazing couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"I like Black Dog. It's one of the better places in CU. 

I enjoy the Cuban sandwich and the pulled pork is good, too. Great beer selection. I usually get the sweet potato fries.

The customer service is not good, though. I've had indifferent and flat out rude service, in fact. The wait is often long, too."}
{"text":"If you make it on time you must try burnt end sandwich. It's also only place to get sweet tea in champaign!"}
{"text":"Great tasting BBQ. Brisket is amazing, with the Peach BBQ sauce. The ribs are perfectly cooked, with meat falling almost falling off the bones."}
{"text":"Great food, great service...get the cornbread!! Pulled pork and brisket were delicious and the Georgia peach sauce made them even better! Love a place that serves sweet potato fries! If you visit on a Tuesday...try the tacos!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef ribs, which were the special.

And then I saw the Cuban sandwich go by and I thought, \"oops, should have ordered that instead.\"

And then I got my ribs and I thought, \"No, I'm glad I got these.\"

But I would for sure try the Cuban next time!

This place was packed on a Wednesday night, with a steady stream of carryout orders going out the door. The only thing I didn't love was that the bar has sort of a wide lip on the edge that forces you to really lean into it to get your food. Not a huge deal, but a minor inconvenience."}
{"text":"Well I had heard and read all the hype.  We went on Sat. around 3 and there was very little wait (5min).  The ribs, pulled pork and collard greens were good but not the best I had every had.  Six beers on tap all leaning towards IPA and a huge selection of bottled beer.  Not worth an hours wait.  The sauces are tomato based.  Neat little bar with good BBQ.  Super selection of Bourbon, whisky and rye.  Samplers of beer and whisky are available.  Wait staff are super."}
{"text":"You can smell this amazing BBQ joint from a block away. The smell will draw you in, just don't let the wait scare you away...it is well worth it. Expect to wait about 20-30 minutes maybe longer for bigger groups. The place can seem a bit cramped when the line is long, so try to get a table that isn't next to the door. While you wait, try one of their rotating craft beers. They have a huge selection, as well as, a full-service bar. 

The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff are all incredibly friendly and attentive. It seems like a family-run place because of the comforting ambience it alludes. 

I've heard the Burnt Ends are where it's at, but they go fast! They start serving them at 11am and 5pm so try and get there right at those times. I haven't had the chance to try them yet, as I've always arrived too late (probably my fault, always taking too long to get ready). 

I have ordered the Beef Brisket Sandwich both times I went to Black Dog and haven't been disappointed yet. I have tried a few different sauces with the brisket and loved them all. My favorite is the house-speciality sauce. The bun it is served on is also super soft. 

The cornbread is amazing, especially with a little bit of butter. And the twice-baked potato casserole is to die for! It is my favorite appetizer on the menu. The applesauce is also deliciously sweet and you can tell it is homemade. 

Black Dog is opening a new location in Champaign, our waitress informed us. She said it should hopefully be up and running by Winter 2015."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! We sat at the bar & had speedy attentive service. The Cowboy Cavier & homemade tortilla chip appetizer was fresh & wonderful. I ordered the beef brisket platter with coleslaw & twice baked potatoes. The beef was excellent- flavorful & tender! The coleslaw was basically plain chopped cabbage in a bowl- worst I've ever had. The potatoes were average. My husband ordered rib tips, fries, & sweet potatoes. The tips we're plentiful, tender, & flavorful! The sweet potatoes were served plain with butter ( no brown sugar or cinnamon). The fries were good & hot. BBQ sauce is served in 2 small dipping cups. There's an added charge for more sauce.  We visited this place from out of town & would probably try a different BBQ joint if we were to come back to Champaign again."}
{"text":"If you only want volume and value, you can go to Lil' Porgy's. If you want fast, mediocre BBQ, Hickory River is a bit further north.

But if you want amazing BBQ and equally inspired sides in an unmatched atmosphere, go to Black Dog. It's the best BBQ you can get in the area (dare I say Illinois?): pulled pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, it's all good. The ambiance is unmatched. Large TV's above the bar if you want to watch something or a warm, inviting seating area if you wanna talk. A huge selection of craft beers. And to top it off, seasonal, local specials (I once had the smoked beet salad, which was glorious).

Take my word for it, the wait isn't that bad. If you want to go out for great food with an old acquaintance, a business meeting with the roommates or perhaps a casual date with the designated lady/gentleman friend, Black Dog will always do you right."}
{"text":"NOM!

This place has great food, hands down. I have been here on two occasions now and both times it has made my heart sing. The flavors are exquisite.

You get to pick your own sauce, which is great, and they'll bring you a sample if you're not sure you're going to enjoy one but you think... well, maybe...

Get the burnt ends. While everything I've tried has been good, the burnt ends are the best thing on the menu. What they did to that meat is... beautiful, artistic, completely wonderful, simultaneously sinful and heavenly. 

Go here. For sure."}
{"text":"Everything here is great.  Rivals some of the best BBQ I've had in the GA and NC (the basis for many of their sauces). I'll also add that they know how to do takeout well. BBQ is a hard food to get right for takeout, but both times I've had it it's tasted almost as good as when I've eaten there.

That may help solve some of the long wait problems that people have correctly pointed out."}
{"text":"I heard of Black Dog two years ago. Wanted to try it, well, I am back in Champaign and made this a destination before I left. The rumor on the streets are correct, great Q, brews, and service. Next time I'm in town I'll stop by for sure!!"}
{"text":"When getting ready to move to CU there were many days where my girlfriend and I would make the 2.5 hour commute to see different houses and apartments, and one day we stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant while we were in between viewings. We actually used Yelp to see what places were the best to go to, and this was right at the top. We were not disappointed.

That first meal was the first of many as Black Dog has turned into one of our absolute favorite restaurants of all time. I knew it was a match made in heaven when they had my favorite beer on draft (Centennial IPA) and had wings that came highly recommended from the staff. And I can see why, the wings are some of the best I've ever had. I had the wings with fries and their must have twice baked potato casserole. I was one happy man. 

Over the course of many visits, we've never been disappointed. They always have a great beer selection, numerous new beers to try, and the food is second to none. Granted, it can get quite busy at both locations but the food and atmosphere is worth the wait. 

Bottom line: if you find yourself in CU for a day, or even if you live here, Black Dog is a restaurant you absolutely must go to. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original, but in a bigger space. Bigger space means smaller wait times and puts that amazing food on your table even sooner!
Staff are great as always, as is the food and drinks.
Not a whole lot to say; same great Black Dog in a different location. One of the best restaurants in C-U without question!"}
{"text":"Love the tips and the ribs!!! Come here for some really great food and ale. The sauces are awesome. Try the peach BBQ sauce if you have the option!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best bbq in East-Central Illinois and it has one of the best beer selections around to go with it.

Nearly everything is made from scratch and has that creative twist you only get when people really care about what they are doing."}
{"text":"Good food, nice beer selection, but it's a little pricey for the portion size and it was PACKED on a Sunday night. They really need to expand or get a bigger place to accommodate its increasing popularity."}
{"text":"This place has the best barbecue I've ever had. Whether you're enjoying the ribs, the burnt ends, or the sweet potato fries dipped in any of their terrific sauces, the Black Dog makes everything taste perfect."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the 3 meat combo with brisket, burnt ends, and ribs.  It was hands down, the best ribs and brisket I've ever had and the second best burnt ends (sorry, Q39 in Kansas City has the best burnt ends). It was worth ever penny I spent, which wasn't much. I'd go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like good BBQ?  I ask you?  Good, though...like so many things in Champaign, I found the ooohing and ahhing pretty over-rated.  It's good food, no doubts, and their burnt ends?  You'd travel the globe for these suckers!  But.. their brisket is often dry(ier than I'd like), and I am SOOOOO not a fan of pulled pork that sometimes has globs of fat in it (it might be that _all_ pulled pork is susceptible, I am just not a fan! =P).  Regardless, you have so much to choose from (http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/menu/), and don't be stingy with the sauce!  I'm a true Carolina girl at heart, and Black Dog does this Carolina Red that's vinegary and tomato-y, and has a bite to it that'll just.. well, it'll make your mouth water.  Other's really like the Hot Georgia Peach, like the most exquisite combination of both heat and sweet!

All in all, you're going to get a fabulous meal here, and for Champaign-Urbana IL, it's some pretty legit BBQ!  Pair it with one of their amazing beers (and the choices are endless! http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/beer/) and you'll leave stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant under $30 per plate in Champaign-Urbana, and it's the best food in that price range that I've had in extensive traveling in downstate Illinois. It's nationally recognized for quality, and it shows in every aspect of their food. The barbecue is flavorful but never dry. The sauces are varied and incredibly tasty. Their sides are delicious. Their sweet tea is to die for. They have a great selection of craft beers. 

The only problem is the wait - they're such a popular destination that you'll frequently have to wait 15-20 minutes (or more) for a table at peak mealtimes, But with their new Champaign location starting to kick off, that might start to get better. 

If you're just passing through and only have time for one meal in Champaign-Urbana, do yourself a favor and make it Black Dog."}
{"text":"Without a doubt their food is fantastic. Every time I've been here I have been very satisfied with the quality of food and selection of beers. I've had a variety of dishes and sides and they deserve the rating of top restaurant in Champaign!

Their service on the other hand...is a different story. Perhaps they can get away with this because of the high quality food but there should be a limit to how poorly they treat customers. Examples of this include being put on hold for 5 minutes when calling for take out, hanging up and then calling back to immediately have my order taken but no apology. When dining in, I don't mind the long wait for a table but when I am seated, I have not even had a server come to my table for 10 or 15 minutes. 

Again, great food but don't expect great service!"}
{"text":"After calling around to all the BBQ places in town, we decided to go with Black Dog for a catering event for 200-300 people.  We got 20 lb. pulled pork, 20 lb. pulled chicken, buns, sauce, potato salad and cole slaw.  They were absolutely fantastic to work with (for instance, offering pulled chicken even though that's not on their catering menu) and the price was the best around (compared to Famous Dave's, Blues, Lil Porgy's, and Hickory River).  

The food was such a hit with the crowd that those of us working the event didn't get a chance to eat much of it, so we went back to Black Dog afterwards and got dinner!  The potato casserole is divine, the potato salad is spicy and delicious, and the meat is just phenomenal.  I've tried the Carolina Red and the Chipotle sauce, both of which were delicious.

The restaurant itself is tiny and was packed on a Friday night, so while turnover is pretty fast, expect to wait 10-20 minutes if you come at a busy time.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and food comes out pretty fast, so no complaints there.  

Prices are pretty standard--about $7 for sandwich and a side, $10-12 for a platter with 1-2 meats and 2 sides.  Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome lunch at Black Dog! Jeff had the burnt ends and brisket. I had a cheeseburger. Twice baked potato casserole was amazing. Burnt ends were some of the best meat he's ever had. You have to get there early or you might have quite the wait! Food is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food is great. 

That being said, I had a very disappointing experience with their service. After calling in a pick up order, I waited inside for nearly 20 minutes. I would've completely understood this if our food wasn't ready and sitting ready to be handed to us for most of this wait. 

When I got home, I checked my order and realized they had forgotten two buns for the beef brisket sandwiches I had ordered and my Carolina Red had somehow become Texas & Georgia Peach. When I called them to tell them about this it became abundantly clear that they intended to do nothing to remedy the situation.  I expect to need to check through everything in my order before leaving a McDonald's drive thru, not a legitimate restaurant."}
{"text":"I always get either the burnt end sandwich or the pulled pork sandwich with Georgia peach bbq sauce and the twice baked potato casserole. The meat is delicious, tender, juicy, soft, and the burnt ends have a nice charred taste to it, which I absolutely love. Get the hot Georgia peach if you want something spicier, but I can't handle the spiciness of it, so I get Georgia peach, which is very sweet and delicious. The twice baked potato casserole is also sooo good and I always get it."}
{"text":"Best barbeque around. Meat is smoked perfectly! I also like that you get to choose what style bbq sauce to have. I'm not much of a Carolina vinegary sauce person, so I reallllly like the Georgia Peach sauce and the Texas sauce. 

Be sure to get there around 5- thats when their burnt ends and smoked sweet potatoes are ready. But don't get there too late or it'll be packed and they might run out of them. Which I guess is alright cause they have so much other good meat. Their pulled pork is amazing, and so is their brisket. 

The older guy who seats you sometimes is a mood killer though, that's all I'll say. 

Expect a wait- you can't call ahead or anything which is a bummer, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Was driving back to WI from IN and based on the reviews from Yelp decided to eat lunch here.  It did not disappoint!!  When we opened the door to go in there was a LINE of people to be seated.  We thought the wait would be really long, but they are quick there!  There was two of us and one had the pulled pork and one had the brisket.  Both had GREAT flavor - Very tender and delicious!  We both had the Carolina Red sauce and loved it.  One had sweet potato fries and one had regular fries - again, both were great!  

The staff was great - very friendly and quick service.  Would definitely go back if driving through that way!"}
{"text":"Burrito special on Thursday.  Best burrito I've ever had.  Waitstaff is great.  Service is fast."}
{"text":"Driving through on an 8 hour road trip. Once again Yelp sent us to the right place. Between the four of us we had the brisket, pork belly, burnt ends, green beans, Cole slaw, corn bread, and many of the different sauces. 
The service was excellent. The food was fast. 
The burnt ends was everyone's favorite. The most tender I have ever had. The sides were on point and the different cuts are perfect. We will be going back although we live nowhere close."}
{"text":"burnt ends are so good!!! They run out fast tho. try their wings too, very tasty!"}
{"text":"We are big Black Dog fans and have been going to the Urbana location for years.  Their food is amazing.  We visited the Chanpaign location for the second & last time today.  Our server was just awful. He said maybe three words, did not tell us of substitution charges and was just plain bored.(Kyle)  I like the atmosphere much better at the crowded Urbana location!  I will admit that the burnt ends are the best I've ever tasted~EXPENSIVE~about a $1 a bite!!!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue.
Being from Chicago I am picky when it comes to food. Hearing so much about Blackdog I couldn't wait to try it.
Enjoyed the food (THE SWEET POTATOE FRIES were bomb). Took the order to-go, but the atmosphere in the restaurant was small and I wouldn't be opposed to eating in. 
Sort of crowded when waiting for food, but that is expected.

Affordable for students and a great treat when you have out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Cool dive bar setting. Great service. The burnt ends were the best I've ever had, but I have had better sauce."}
{"text":"Why I haven't reviewed this place sooner is a mystery to me. Downtown Urbana has become a much better place since the opening of Black Dog. BD has become one of my regular dinner spots, their meals hardly ever disappoint. The only drawback is the waiting, sometimes you stroll right in and get seated, other times, it's an hour wait. The wait staff is very hit or miss, I have a few favorite waiters (yup, guys) and one waitress that I think are helpful, attentive, and funny. 

What to eat: 
Appetizers: smoked chicken wings, smoked artichoke dip (AMAZING!) 

Meats: anything pork (seriously), smoked chicken (I MUST try their brisket)
The burgers-all

Sides: sweet potato fries, French fries, beans, slaw, twice baked potato casserole

Drinks: great selection of beers, wait staff and bartenders tend to give spot on recommendations
If liquor isn't your thing, they make their own sweet iced tea-yum

Ok: dinner salad with pulled pork, portabella sandwich

Meh: Cuban sandwich -- while it's the best one in town, I was a bit disappointed in its size and it's good, but not excellent. That said, I might give it a second try.

Misses: Chicken salad (new) and their very popular corn bread (sorry, it's all of that meat in it, for some reason I just can't like it!)

I was just there this past Tuesday and am already planning my return. 4/5 stars because of the long waiting, running out of food quickly (though who can blame the hoards of hungry customers?!), and the hit-or-miss wait staff

-I HIGHLY recommend this place the food is excellent, the drinks are good, and the prices are very fair do keep on mind that due to it's popularity lines can be a bit crazy"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Tried the pulled pork and it was amazing.  Love the peach sauce with sweet potato fries and that twiced baked potato casserole is die for. Definately going back!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the Black Dog Smokehouse when we were in town visiting family. We went on a Friday evening around 7 and the place was already packed! We waited over an hour to be seated. One frustration was that because we had 3 people in our group, many many groups who came after us with only a party of 2 were seated before us. The place ultimately needs to get a bigger location with more seating. I nonetheless gave them 5 stars because I am rating the food not the restaurant itself. Their food was phenomenal - the best barbecue/comfort food I have ever had! Reasonable prices too! My only regret was that I wished we had ordered more food! We really worked up an appetite after the hour wait! Would go again!"}
{"text":"Without question, met expectations and its fine reputation is well deserved. I missed out on the burnt ends but the pulled rib sandwich was out of this world...loved it with the mustard based bbq sauce. Corn bread was perfect and a solid beer selection for its exclamation point. It is a destination spot in Urbana!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to get in to this place; there's always a line out the door, which speaks to the quality.

Made it there around 8:30 on a Saturday night, and immediately got a seat at the bar. Smoked catfish sandwich was probably the best sandwich I ever had. Twice-baked potatoes were an excellent side.

But the best thing was the waiter; when I told him what beer I wanted, he said, \"Well, it's OK, but how often will you come here?\" He pointed me instead to a Founder's seasonal release which was phenomenal. The only problem now is: what do I do with all the beer I already have at home?

Came back the following (Super Bowl) night, and the burnt ends were not sold out - and it was just as good as the night before.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Black Dog has all the standard types of BBQ fare such as cornbread, Mac n cheese (which is so good that it has to bring down the life expectancy in the surrounding area), and all your typical BBQ meats. You can also get combo platters which I highly recommend: you get servings of multiple different meats and sides while forsaking the bread. My personal favorites are the brisket, pulled pork, and the chicken. I've never had the burnt ends, but they always seem to run out of it, so I imagine that it is excellent, too."}
{"text":"Big fan of Black Dog. I had lunch at the Dog while traveling on business and was extremely and pleasantly surprised at the quality of BBQ.

The 12-hour cooked brisket was as good as any brisket I've ever had and their sauces compliment very nicely."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT time. We wanted to go somewhere different for a medium sized meal and decided to try out Black Dog. The food and environment were the highlights:

Food- We both got pulled pork sandwich so I can speak of other items (A friend highly recommended the ribs) and cornbread, which were not the best I've ever tasted but tasted excellent none-the-less. The menu's are simplified and easy to order.

Environment- Being in the arts and working at an upscale restaurant in downtown Champaign myself, I was impressed with the quality of the furnishings. The bar seems great for a couple rounds and a nice bite to eat, and some of the people were well on their way when we were there! Service was great and timely.

Plan to make it out to Black Dog at least once a month from now on!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and the food never disappoints. So many good sauce choices and all the meats are so tender  and flavorful. Can't wait to eat here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best BBQ within 100 miles. If you can get burnt ends I highly recommend them. I also enjoy the catfish, ribs and rib tips. I have not had a bad meal from here in the 5 years I've been going."}
{"text":"Graduation weekend what a busy time for everyone and their families! And who has time to cook during that hectic weekend, so my boyfriend his family and I decided that between his graduation ceremonies to grab a bite to eat. 
 Boy was Black Dog rolling! His dad went ahead of time to put our name in to wait for seating, putting in consideration we were a party of 8, and it was about an hour or so wait. Although very understandable due to it being graduation.  Once seated our waitress was polite and helpful and made sure we had plenty of time to make our decisions. We had ordered 2 appetizers one of which was I believe Texas caviar and the other an order of bone in chicken wings. I really enjoyed the caviar however, the chips where kind of oily for my preference. I didn't try the chicken wings, I'm not a huge fan of bone in, but I was told they were very good. As I let my eyes wonder the restaurant and the decor upon the walls it was pretty basic, with a rather large bar and several flat screen tvs with various sports games displayed. 
  Our food came out in a timely manner, served like true BBQ on a metal tray. I ordered a chicken salad sandwhich which consisted of smoked chicken breats, mayo, pickled jalapenos, sliced pecans and a seasoning, on sourdough with sweet potato fries. The chicken salad was very crisp and yummy, the fries however, were kind of limp and plain. When asked around the table how everyone's food tasted nothing but positive comments were made. 
  Over all Black dog was, in my opinion, slightly above average. However, I am from southern Mississippi so nothing will compare to true Memphis BBQ but they sure come close."}
{"text":"I'm not a BBQ connoisseur, but it's the best BBQ I've ever had. Best restaurant in C-U."}
{"text":"What an excellent random find for us!

Work brought J and I to Illinois so we did what we do best - wander around hungry.  

We ventured into this place at just after 4 on a Friday and it was close to dead - only 2 other tables filled.  

Serena was our server though she seemed like she coulda been in charge,  too. She was friendly and knowledgeable. 

We were too early for the burnt ends (they come outta the smoker at 11 and 5) so picky Pete was sad  but he got over it when he tasted his rib.

The sweet tea was literally perfect. 

I got pulled pork sammich with Georgia peach sauce with pit beans.  Spicy,  savory,  good portion. Beans were hot, meat was not.  Usually I care; this time, I didn't.  Delicious. 

Picky got pork ribs,  the catfish, corn muffin and sweet potato fries.   He practically nibbled the ribs to death because he wanted them to last.  The fish was sauteed, not fried,  and while he liked it, he wouldn't get it again.   Corn muffin was substantial but unmemorable and the fries were crisp and plentiful.   

Came to $28 plus tax before tip.   We plan to return while we're still here."}
{"text":"Overall for a BBQ place they are decent. One of their larger issues is portion sizes for both main dishes and sides. Many BBQ places are known for giving you a good amount of food for what you pay for. This is not one of them, which in turn makes their prices more expensive. ($2 for one small corn muffin is a little ridiculous) Also, if you are a big fan of tomato based BBQ then you will arrive disappointed. 

Aside from those issues, I've never had a problem with service and their fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"The four stars is because of the food, I really like barbecue and theirs was smoky good.  I had the ribs and pulled pork and both were great.  My side of Mac n Cheese was also very very good.

But I am going to dog on Black dog for the place itself.  The food was fairly expensive yet you are in a physically uncomfortable environment.  If it's a bar, why are they serving such good food?  If it's a restaurant why are the seats and tables so crappy?  Plus the lines are really long, would bar patrons want to wait that long?  And if they are there for a bar aren't they going to take up seats for a long time so people can't eat?

I like the food but the concept seems pretty conflicted.  Work it out, be a bar or a restaurant and accommodate one set of customers.  

I hope it's the restaurant with new seating.  Arf arf."}

{"text":"Black Dog you are my friend, my lover.  Your slow-smoked brisket, your hand-made sides, your succulent rib-tips attract me with the magnetism of a particle accelerator.  You introduced me to the joy of cider; you do Arnold Palmer justice.  Oh Black Dog, oh Black Dog."}
{"text":"Recipes are one thing to roll out to a new location, but good-natured friendly service can sometimes be hard to get right. Thankfully Mr Cochrane and his colleagues got both spot on at the new branch of their award-winning barbeque joint. Even if it is take out only for a few months, it is worth a visit for anybody who appreciates good food and even better people. Six stars."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice little BBQ place, not that many seats so get there early! They have a variety of BBQ sauces that are delicious. The specials are good but you have to get there early because they run out fast! Definitely a place to go in the CU area!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoked catfish and twice baked potato casserole among other great choices.  

Georgia peach BBQ sauce is good.

Everything on the menu is delicious and flavorful - wow!  

Great beer selection.

Prepare to wait in line for a table..."}
{"text":"Great bbq joint. You can't ask for better service. 

I can honestly say that if you ordered an appetizer, it may come after your meal.  Or it would force them to not give you your food right away.
 
Ordered, then took a deep breath, followed by a blink of the eye and BOOM!! Foods here! 

I compliment our waiter for messing up our order and bringing us the wrong side because he ended up bringing us the side that we actually ordered and let us keep the other.  

That was deserving of generous tip for the nice fellow. 

Great BBQ, Better Service."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at Black Dog BBQ in Champaign with my Wingman and I had the beef brisket. It was good. It was really crowded but we were waited on quickly and our waitress was supper nice to us. We didn't have any problems at this place. We will definitely go back. You should check it out."}
{"text":"I'm from Champaign, and this is the best restaurant in town. Reasonably priced Carolina-style bbq with some heavenly creations. Burnt ends are a must try, as are the ribs. There on a Wednesday? Give the Cuban a whirl. There's also a much smaller BD in Urbana, but same food for the most part. I visit often."}
{"text":"Black dog in Urbana food thoughts

Ribs definitely good - savory, smokey, come off the bone easily. 4 stars. Mild critique, possibly a bit too lean, and as a result perhaps on the ever so slightly tough side of acceptable

Burnt ends sandwich - apparently quite good, based on my February 2013 notes. I do remember being rather satisfied with the trip and the food overall

Twice baked potato casserole - also February 2013, basically tastes like the inside of a twice baked potato, which is to say, pretty good

Polish sausage - rather good for what it is, and grows on you throughout the sandwich. Very good toasted french bread bun

Beans - eh, nothing to write home about

Chips and salsa - same, eh

Sauce - nothing knocks it put of the park, but they're all pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good BBQ in a small town!  The sauces can be REALLY spicy, and I can handle my fair share of spiciness!  

The habanero and other sauce are different here... I've had spicy food/sauces that burn all the way through and linger for a long time, but Black Dog has sauces that burns going down, then it disappears (to give you hope), and reappears within 30 seconds to a minute... and then it burns and lingers for a long time.  MADNESS!  

IF you're in Urbana-Champaign, try this spot!"}
{"text":"Ate at The Black Dog with our kids today.  AMAZING bbq place in Urbana.  They smoke all their own meat and everything was great.  My husband had the brisket, I had pulled pork, our son had burned ends and his girl had jumbalya.  Everything was perfect.  This is a small place, so don't expect to sit right down.  They also have some great brews and full bar.  I would absolutely go again!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is simply the best BBQ you will ever eat in Illinois. Period. 

Everything is amazing. I have never had better BBQ in my life and I doubt that I will. My personal favorites: burnt ends, brisket, chicken sandwich, pit beans, sweet potato fries. Everything has a smokey taste to it, making it so authentic. 

Additionally, they have many kinds of BBQ sauces to choose from and even offer a BBQ sauce platter so you can try all of them. My personal favorite is the Texas Sauce. It's spicy, but not too spicy, and very strong and thick. I love it! 

Although the lines are long, it is still an efficient system and texts you when your table is about to be ready. It's a great system! The staff is efficient and well trained. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've found in CU. We've been lucky as far as wait time, but the new location may help with that."}
{"text":"I'm from the South. The home of real BBQ. This place is hands-down the best BBQ I've found in this area. The waits can be a little crazy if you get there at the wrong time, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I don't think there is a need to write a review for this place! Simply, one of the best bbq places in Illinois! with a tone of space and less line in their new branch! my favorite is the beef brisket!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  This place is always packed.  There are always lines outside waiting to get in so I tried it.  The food, in my opinion, was terrible.  I didn't like the bbq at all.  Granted the sweet fries were delicious but everything else was awful.  My friend who was with me at the time, hated the food too.  Everyone else says its good food so try it for yourself, but as far as I'm concern keep trucking pass this dog."}
{"text":"As anticipated, there was a long wait since this place is heralded as one of the best in Illinois. We were rather underwhelmed. The food was good, but we didn't think it was great. In fairness, it's Texas style BBQ, and I'm not a huge Texas style fan (although I love BBQ). The burnt tips were excellent, as advertised. The pork ribs and pulled pork were just OK. The service was sub-par. Our server never came back to refill our waters or to ask if we wanted another beer."}
{"text":"Always absolutely delicious.  Your entire group needs to be there before they will seat you.  Carry out works very well and food travels wonderfully.  Couldn't recommend more."}
{"text":"This place was too hyped up for me. Not perfect. I had better barbecue elsewhere but it's as good as gets in Illinois. I would recommend the pulled pork and briskets. Get there early for the burnt tips and to avoid the lines! The line does form quickly in this small place."}
{"text":"I didn't expect such a crowd for lunch in the summer, but I guess this place is popular with people working at the courthouse nearby. The place has a great lively atmosphere and decor featuring...surprise! cute dogs! The best thing was that the ingredients are fairly high quality, they try to use local meat when they can and their sauces are delicious."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!  Black Dog is revitalizing downtown Urbana.  The food is great, the staff is great, and the draft line variety keep you coming back for more.

No reservations, but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Moved out of state a year and a half ago and this is the first place I eat when I come back. I've eaten BBQ all over the country. Memphis, North Carolina, St Louis, Kansas City. I even made a pilgrimage to Lockhart TX. I can't possibly say which place is the best but I will say that Black Dog is awfully close. The Burnt Ends, the smoked wings and their ribs are the stand outs to me. Cherish this place if you are a local as it is truly one of the best BBQ restaurants in the country!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Very friendly service.
I recommend this place. Interesting beer on tap- even a blueberry mash beer- nearly a wine.
Tasty sauces."}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the best BBQ places I've ever been to. I wish they'd cook the BBQ sauce onto the meat, but basically no place does that so I can't complain. What's 5 stars about this place?

- The meat is smoked to perfection. It's tender and delicious.
- The burnt ends. If you try them, you'll love it.
- The sauces are fantastic. I love the Carolina red, but they have a great variety and the 4-5 I've tried ranged from really good to outstanding (I've eaten here multiple times).
- The sides are amazing. Baked beans, apple sauce, corn bread, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, they were all amazing.

We even catered this place for a lunch at work and the two vegetarians loved the vegetarian options they were ordered, but I was focused on the meat so I can't tell you what that was."}
{"text":"My daughter and I popped in after reading 5 star reviews on yelp.  We both had the burnt ends sandwich with fries.  We really enjoyed their house made bbq sauce called Texas Sauce.  I enjoyed their regular coleslaw, I believe I tasted radish which gave it a nice twang.  It was a small bar with limited seating.   I wish our waitress was more tentative towards us.  It was annoying but not enough to take a star away.  I'm telling you the food was outstanding"}
{"text":"I've been to Black Dog two times now, and have been pleasantly surprised both times.  My coworkers had told me about this place and everyone had ranting about how amazing it was.  Given that I love good barbecue, I knew I had to check it out, so when a buddy of mine got dumped by his fiancee, I knew exactly what he needed--beer and barbecue from Black Dog.

The first time I went, I had a pulled-pork sandwich with fries and a beer.  I had the standard red sauce, which was tangy and delicious.  The pork was juicy and flavorful.  The bun was large and tasty.  They put coleslaw on their pulled pork sandwiches, which I probably would have asked them not to put on it had I known, but I decided to give it a shot since it came that way, and I was pleasantly surprised at how it added to the experience.  The fries were good steak fries--fairly standard fare for such a place.  It's hard to mess up fries.

The second time I went was with a large group of people (~12), which given the size of the place, proved to be a bit of a chore.  Part of the group had to sit in a booth, while the rest occupied the high tables.

I ordered a full rack of ribs with potato salad and sweet potato fries on the side.  Sweet potato fries are always great, but because of the sugar content seldom reach a decent level of crispiness.  These were adequately crispy and very flavorful and had brown sugar on them, adding a nice touch.  The potato salad had something spicy in it, which gave it a nice, unique kick.  The ribs were fantastic, and having been there, I really wouldn't recommend anywhere else in town for ribs.  They had clearly been cooked a long time and seemingly without boiling.  The edges were crispy and flavorful and the insides were tender and juicy.  I ordered the same sauce I had ordered the first time I visited, which once again, was tangy, sweet, and delicious.

The atmosphere was good--pretty laid back, somewhat cozy and down-to-earth while still maintaining a sense of rustic class.  The layout prevents the gathering of particularly large groups, which is not surprising for a place that size.  It was worth splitting the group a bit to go there."}
{"text":"I'm a long-time lurker, first-time writer.

We went to Black Dog last night at 8:00pm after hearing rave reviews on two local blogs (you probably can guess which ones.)

Well, we stood by the door for a good 5 to 7 minutes politely waiting with absolutely no one giving us a blink of attention. We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.

Finally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.

I can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)

But if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.

No thanks. We went down the street to Seven Saints and had a nice dinner with friendly service."}
{"text":"Ok Yelp...you did NOT let me down on this one.  What an AWESOME BBQ experience.  I'm sad we do not have one of these near me.  The burnt ends were delicious and I kept thinking of them even after I left and drove home.  The cornbread which is made with jalapenos and pulled pork inside it was a standout hit for me as well.  Just add butter and it becomes heaven.  The twice baked potatoes which is a staple there was really good but I did not fall in love with them like people told me I would..perhaps the bar was too high.

Now the sauces.  I don't know what is inside the Hot Georgia Peach sauce but great god almighty it is delicious!  I could spread that on an old work shoe of mine and gobble the whole leather thing up without blinking.  It was DELICIOUS!

I would come back here in a heart beat to try another meat."}
{"text":"This is easily the best bbq in town, not that there's much competition. 

As someone who lived in Kansas City for a while, I know what good barbecue tastes like. This place keeps up with the best of them. 

The only problem with Black Dog used to be long wait times; but now, with a new store in downtown champaign, that's no longer an issue."}
{"text":"Came on the Sunday morning of homecoming weekend. Black dog opens at 11am on Sundays, and we had never been to this new Champaign location but knew the Urbana locations fills up quickly. Got here at 10:45, we were the first ones here. Walked around to kill time, came back at 10:50 and there were 15 people in line! Thankfully this location holds a lot more people so everyone was seated without a problem. Black Dog is always one of my go-to restaurants when I'm back in the area, so I can't imagine living there and not frequenting this place often!"}
{"text":"Burnt ends sandwich with twice baked potato casserole simply delicious! Friendly and welcoming bar staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food -- always busy (get there right at 11 or after 1, then right at 5 but after 7 to avoid the lunch/dinner rush -- otherwise you'll be standing in a long line)  BUT I have a few issues:

1.  It's kid friendly only if your kid can sit by himself in a chair.   There are no high chairs in this place -- probably because the tables and booths are fairly high (booths are on risers, tables are tall bar tables) so you either have to tag team with another person in your party to hold your kid while the other eats OR bring your own portable high chair that attaches to one of the booths OR hire a babysitter and have a parents' night out.

2.  Prices.   Prices are fairly reasonable considering all the food is local, but some of the specials seem a little bit over-priced.   I mean, Monday's they have a Chicago style hot dog.... $6.95 for a hot dog seems pretty steep.  As well as the beef stroganoff....we ordered a takeout order of this and it came in one of those small takeout soup containers.  It rang in to around $11.95 if I'm not mistaken.... YIKES.   I would stick with the sandwiches for $6.95 with one side.  A platter is $11.95 -- basically the same thing (minus the bun) + two sides.   The price jump from a sandwich to a platter doesn't seem worth it to me.

Those are my two issues.  We eat here at least once a week and I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, and the burnt end sandwich (although the last couple times I had it, it was dry).  My side of choice is either the potato salad (to die for!) or a side salad (all local,fresh vegetables....so refreshing!!!).

UPDATE:  they now have highchairs!  The kind that attach to the table.  We actually bought a Phil and Ted portable high chair to specifically bring with us to BD, but they beat us to it....  So now i only have the one issue about their prices.  BTW -- their smoked chicken is WONDERFUL as well as their pit beans.   If you're wondering what to feed your 10 month old baby, try little bits of chicken, pulled pork, the sweet potato and some beans!"}
{"text":"Walking up to the door you are hit with the smell of SMOKE!! I have tried the pulled pork, brisket and ribs. All some of the best!!! The sauce has a good kick. Small interior but worth the wait....there will be a wait! The beans are BBQ tasty and the potatoe salad is a solid one. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Like all the reviews say, this is a popular place.  Plan to wait on the curb (literally) for your table with the rest of the hungry patrons.  

Ordered the platters (3 meat choices) and we mixed up the sides.  Meat was excellent and the highlight was the burnt ends.  Wow.  Don't miss them.  Sweet potato fries were good, but I've had better, probably because these ones had cooled down.

This is a don't miss food destination that should satisfy your BBQ craving."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is about as good as it gets! The rib tips, twice-baked potato casserole and pit beans, and Carolina red sauce is my go to favorite, but everything is good. The cuban sandwich (Wed special) is great with fries and a side of the mustard BBQ sauce. The burgers are also good and several are topped with BBQ meats. If you're starving, and they haven't run out yet, get an appetizer order of burnt ends to share with your pals! I like the chicken wings tossed in hot Georgia peach if I'm there for beer and a snack."}
{"text":"Black Dog has THE best BBQ in the Champaign/Urbana area hands down.  Now all they need is a larger space to serve it in, i love the bar setting, but not one that has outgrown its space because of how good their product is.  Waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go.

As for the food, lets start with the Wings appetizer, delicious smoked wings and the kick of the Carolina BBQ sauce puts them over the top.  My wife can't stop talking about how good the burnt ends are, and she must not be the only one because the sell out frequently.   Loved the ribs, just wish they had some baby backs to choose from.

All in all you will not beat this place for BBQ anywhere within a hundred miles!"}
{"text":"This location just doesn't do it as well as the original in Urbana.  There is a high level to reach to match that and for now, i will not come back here if i have the choice, urbana, or nothing"}
{"text":"My dear black dogs, the best place I've ever eaten at in my life.  I left Illinois a while ago and sadly have never found a place in the North or Western states that can compare.  I remember how the sauces were so good I'd shred the meat so it could get as much surface area of sauce as possible, cleaning out each cup of sauce.

Thank you for putting soul into food.  I've been a barbeque fan since"}
{"text":"This place was really good. A little hard to find, its the building that looks like a train station off the cul-de-sac. The brisket and pork ribs were amazing. I found the meat so flavorful I hardly used the sauces. The fries were really good but the slaw can be skipped. Also for the appetizer, the cherry salsa was incredible. Service was good and fairly quick. Would come back."}
{"text":"This place did not live up to its hype. Perhaps because we did not get to try the famous rib tips that people keep talking about. We tried the three meat combo and chicken salad. I really disliked the chicken salad. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The BBQ was fine. Dry and smoky."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. Im currently living and San Diego but I grew up in Champaign/Urbana Illinois and until this place, the only comparable business was lil porgy's, not that I don't love porgy's, but this is just on another level of good. 
I know its hard to get their beef brisket BURNT ENDS. But if you can get their early enough on the weekend its worth the wait. I can't say enough good things about this place. Even their own sauces are amazing. 

You won't leave unsatisfied. I promise. Unless you don't like good BBQ, then you're weird anyways."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Friendly staff, quick service with nice portions! Little too smokey flavor on beans but brisket was very tasty and tender!"}
{"text":"In my experience at the Dog the B.B.Q.  the ribs, tips, at least are really hit or miss, I've had real good and I have had some of the worst  ribs and tips I have paid for. Over cooked, dry, tough just bad. I waited 30 to 40 min. to get bad food ? They have very good sauces. The wait is always long even for to go I have stood there packed in the entrance for 35mins. for two sandwiches, rib tips, and two potatos. Burnt end are very good I was lucky enough to get them once, but never again. I went one day and got right in only two or three people there, lucky day right? No they where out of food.Is it not on the first page of restaurants for dummies to make money and have customers you need to have food? This place is out of control, to bad if done right it could be great.So for now I've given up one this one. We will soon have the B.B.Q. triangle The Black Dog, LI'L Porgy's, and Po Boys when they move into the neighbourhood later this year. Lets see what happens."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Its always packed. Cool atmosphere. The first time I remember there being better service. Second time not so much. We waited for ten minutes just to get menus. 
I got the beef brisket with the Carolina sauce and sweet potato fries, I liked mine. The fries were the best sweet potato fries ever. Rest of family had pulled pork and they said it was dry. They were out of their homemade hot sauce and awkwardly brought two pretty much empty bottles to the table saying they needed to make more."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened another location because the lines before this opened were just too long. The food is still great and the people are still nice. There's only one thing that could be improved and that's waiting for a to-go order. After I ordered, I kinda just stood around near what I'm guessing is the \"to go window\" and there really isn't any space to stand or sit... If you guys can figure out a way to minimize the awkwardness while waiting for a to-go order, I would make this a 5 star. (:"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about how great Black Dog is, and finally got a chance to try it this past weekend.  Having heard that the burnt ends sell out quickly, my friends and I got there at 5 (apparently the have a batch of burnt ends at 11 AM and 5 PM) to a minimal line, and got seated after about 10 minutes of waiting.  As good as everything on the menu sounded, I knew I had to have the burnt ends, so I ordered a burnt ends sandwich.

I took my first bite of my burnt ends sandwich and instantly the only things I could think were, \"Oh my god this is amazing\" and \"What have I been doing the last four years of my life?\".  The burnt ends had a delicious smoke flavor which were complemented very well by the Carolina Red BBQ sauce, which has a slight bit of heat.  I also enjoyed the soft cornmeal dusted bun that the meat came on.  I found this sandwich to go really well with the draft Arrogant Bastard that I had.  For my side I had the regular fries, which were good, but nothing extraordinary.  The burnt ends were the true standout here.  

It's a shame I didn't come here before I ended up graduating, but I guess I avoided gaining 10 pounds from eating here all the time if I did."}
{"text":"We've been going to Black Dog almost every week for the last couple of years. Great place if you don't mind the wait. If you mind the wait, go for lunch on weekdays or choose odd hours, when most people don't have their lunch or dinner. 

Most of their food is really good. I particularly like the pork belly sandwich and the rib tips."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Good service. Very fun atmosphere at night."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a weekend and my daughter took us there. I'm southern so I'm picky about my barbecue. Pulled pork was tender and flavorful. Salmon was cooked with a good marinade. Great cocktail from the bar. Service was professional but not overly friendly. Burnt ends were a let down. Lots of build up but just so so. Lots of yelling going on which is silly."}
{"text":"Burnt ends, fresh lemonade and a pulled pork sandwich. I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon  lunch with the  boys and it is meat and beer heaven. I had the combo platter ribs, brisket, and burnt ends. Ribs were kick but good brisket is some of the best I have ever had. Burnt ends were something I would have not selected  vs the fried polish sausage which buddy had and it looked  good. Sides are OK don't come here for that it's the meat. Service was friendly  and fast. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great, but expensive. Amazing sauces, meat cooked near perfectly in a variety of ways. Definitely a must for anyone visiting Urbana.

Beware of the long line on some days! 

For a cheaper alternative, visit Lil' Porgy's down the street."}
{"text":"Really good and tasty bbq. Love the pit beans and burnt ends. The peach sauce is my favorite. Really surprised how fast the food came out when I went on Sunday. I really like this new location...bigger and less wait time in line!"}
{"text":"Well worth the detour off the freeway.  We showed up on a Sunday and found it relatively busy but we were welcomed immediately and chose a couple seats at the rail. I recommend it if you wanna check out all the going ons in the kitchen. It's small and they crank out the quality. We did a 2 meat sampler with slaw and a burger.  Burnt ends done right. Burger was cooked perfect so thankful, can't stand grey sad patties.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing and even when they're super busy, its never a long wait (yet such a worthwhile wait indeed!)"}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Best ribs I've ever had, as well as best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  Service is alright but its a packed bar, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"8:00 pm roughly so we took forever to find the place.  there is no sign on the door building, windows nothing.  only signs that say parking is only for black dog customers, but whatever we made it.

So we get in and ask what is the best and he says the salmon is great.  Awesome sounds great I love salmon, I'll have the salmon, oh sorry we're all out.  Oh great recommendation,  I'll have the burnt ends, sold out.  I was highly irritated but finally found something they had.  Fortunately the food is amazing, as long as they have it.  Was a two star review until the food came out."}
{"text":"There's little I can add that hasn't already been said.  Except maybe this.  Best chicken wings I have ever eaten.  Ever."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time
I live in Chicago and dream of it every night"}
{"text":"Everyone I've talked to has hyped this place up and its just okay. I got the meatloaf sandwich and my companion got the tasting platter combo plate thing. I know what you're thinking: you ordered meatloaf?!? Well the meatloaf was delicious compared to the combo plate (I won) which I find satisfying and disappointing at the same time. The BBQ was supposed to be amazing here but I thought it was dry. They provided sauces and whatnot but really good BBQ doesn't need anything extra. Also I thought it was funny that the combo plate was more expensive than the meatloaf and I got this huge thing plus sides whereas my friend got these small samples of meat. If I remember correctly, they brew their own beer in the back (or have stuff on tap) which was really good. All in all, this place has too much hype because it's good but not to die for like everyone says."}
{"text":"Their rib is simply the best in this area and the best I ever had. Georgia peach sauce is even better than any similar sauce I tried in Georgia!

tip: You can do take out to avoid the constant long line."}
{"text":"Named after the owners' two dogs: Oscar and Lola...Black Dog has officially opened. 

Finally! 

A lip-smackin' smoke house with a more than decent beer menu...offering a cozy warm environment too!

They offer VERY reasonably priced sandwiches for $6-$10: pulled pork, catfish, chicken, brisket, polish and more! They also buy wheels of goat cheese (specially made just for Black Dog) and blue cheese from the local Prairie Fruits Farm and smoke it. Damnit..this place is perfect. 

After 5 p.m., pork spare ribs are not only to die for, but very affordable, and need no sauce. Score a full slab for $15 to boot!"}
{"text":"It's great,  because it's a one of a kind in the area; but that's it's downfall.  45-1 hour waits are the norm,  and it's really not worth the wait in my opinion.  Not many options for those who only eat fish, salmon only offered 2 days,  hubby loves smoked bbq,  &  agrees not worth the wait or hype. Also, there are no kids menus or portions.  Just not family friendly."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, beers, and service. Atmosphere is also great. The burnt ends were awesome. The pulled pork nachos got us started and we had more burn ends, sausage, and pulled pork for dinner. All flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"As we entered we were enthusiastically greeted by one of the servers. Hopefully, as you'd expect, all of the staff members are as nice as she is, come to find out the bartender we had wasn't as peachy. Not that she was mean, just general going through the motions and not just for us but for all guests seated at the bar. 

The food was decently good, just not as finger-lickin amazing as everyone I have spoken with prior to this visit made me feel it was going to be. I did really enjoy their sweet potato fries (nice and crisp and thick). The chicken sandwich I had was good, once the barbecue sauce was able to make its way down to the pulled chicken on the bottom of the bun. Otherwise, it was a bit dry. My boyfriend had the Carolina sandwich and he enjoyed that along with the potato salad as his side.

A good selection of alcoholic beverages with not the largest selection of beers. The \"Ale House\" part of the name gave us the impression that maybe there were several selections on tap but, as I recall, there weren't a ton nor could we see the tap handles (outside of 1) to get a visual (sometimes that's nice to see). Of course there was a beer list, though. 

Overall, not a terrible experience but just a basic one. Nothing crazy."}
{"text":"My colleague and I visited while we were in town for work tonight. We arrived to be seated very promptly at either a bar spot or table so we choose the bar. Service was friendly, cheerful, and prompt; we each tried some sample beer sips and then got a draught. Everything on the menu sounded delicious but we were just looking for some light bites and then some beer samples. I enjoyed the 1/3 rack of ribs appetizer with a garden salad on the side and my colleague had the same salad with the rib ends. The smoky flavor was incredible and their sauce selection was top notch. I tried both the mild Georgia Peach and the more spicy Carolina vinegar sauce while my colleague tried the hot Georgia Peach. The barbecue was a dry rub - which isn't my favorite - but I have to say the meat was super juicy and tender. If we were in town for longer than one night I would absolutely go back. The barbacks seem to be almost over-staffed and very helpful and conversational to us travelers. Two thumbs up! Bonus: there's a parking lot right next door, so we didn't have to consider street parking."}
{"text":"Oh man... Black Dog... I wish you were closer!! Though I'm considering driving down to Champaign just to indulge in your tasty 'que and brews! Just thinking about you is making my mouth water!

This is a great joint in your are looking for some solid BBQ   They also have a nice selection of microbrews. Get ready to wait though... We went at 3pm on Saturday and we still waited for a solid 20 minutes! Though the wait during peak lunch and dinner hours is way worse... It's almost painful watching plates of mouthwatering meats pass by you while you stand there helplessly. But trust me, the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Love, Love the Bbq here!  We went early-ish 5:15 on a Tuesday, only waited 5-10 min before getting a booth.  We got one of the 5 last burnt ends, and they sold out before we got our food. We also ordered Pulled Pork, sweet potato fries, mac n cheese, Catfish sandwich, and Bbq nachos. All super smokin delicious! I was craving hot spicy so I went with Chipotle sauce. Ahhhmazing!  Downtown Champaign was a great clean classy atmosphere. Would recommend taking any out-of-town guest here!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing pork belly! Beer is on point and the atmosphere is legit. Stop in, order some amazing pork, because 'Merica, and get drunk... once again, because 'Merica!!!"}
{"text":"Take a Train to Flavor Town! 
This former train depot is my last stop on the Champaign BBQ trail.  And Im kicking myself ever since. If this was the first stop, the quest would have ended and I would have spent three days camping outside this establishment. 
Cool venue, concrete bar, polite accommodating staff and \"to murder a live a cow for\" Brisket.  
Best brisket in the midwest. I'll stand by that and possibly extent its bounds.  
They tackle smoked wings with elegance and the forever elusive smoked salmon with grace.  But, ultimately the Brisket is the buy.  And seemingly the burnt ends, which ran out twice in our visit. 
A note on sides, a smoked sweet potato may change your opinion of this super food. If your child won't eat green beans just give them the Black Dog Beans and force him/her to take a bite and watch them contradict themselves at the table. 
Go here.  Move in if they'll let you."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5's and this is definitely a 5

Hands down, best bbq I've had, on top of that, extremely cheap prices.

it is always packed though, best if you come early for lunch (around 11) anytime else it will be full with a wait.

rib tips and burnt ends are straight up legit"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said before? I met my boss here for lunch on a sunny Monday afternoon. We were quickly greeted by we had 2 more people yet to show up so we had to wait for them to be seated.

As soon as our party was there, we were quickly ushered to a table and greeted by our server. 

He informed us that he had been overhearing our conversations at the table and was happy to report that they did have burnt ends and explained to one of my lunch mates what a mufelleta was and what it was made of today. This was a great touch - what an easy way to make a quick and easy impression on a table!

So, I got my burnt ends sandwich, along with sweet potato fries - which I had been told were AMAZING. I also ordered their beans.

We also ordered the cornbread... which was delish!!! I recommend it highly. It was moist, slightly spicy... and full of amazingness!

The burnt end sandwich was increds. Cooked to perfection and flavored wonderfully with a Carolina Red sauce.

The sweet potato fries weren't amazing - they were AH-MAY-ZING!!!!!

The beans were delish as well - and did not need for me to add in any sauce or anything, which is my usual habit.

I have to say... I have been coming to central Illinois for years and I am pissed it took until today for me to get to this place.

I will be back... probably every trip to central Illinois!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a MUST if you are in the Champaign/Urbana area.

The food, the drink, and the service are all WONDERFUL. 

I ordered the brisket and catfish as my proteins and beans and cornbread as my sides. The brisket and beans were my favorite food items: the brisket was smokey and moist and the beans were moderately spicy and were made with drippings from the brisket, YUM! The catfish was nothing to write home about but with the flight of sauces that I ordered I was able to pair it up with a sauce that made it more interesting (favorite sauces were the Georgia Peach, Texas BBQ, and Carolina vinegar). 

I also ordered the top-shelf bourbon flight which had the best bourbon I've ever tasted, 20 year Pappy Van Winkle! The pours were large which was a pleasant surprise for a top-shelf flight, much appreciated.

As far as service goes, I have never had such a welcoming, fun-loving, and informed server as I did at Black Dog. Everyone at the place made our 8 top feel like they were happy we were there and wanted us to love everything we ate, and we most certainly did. 

I will definitely be back, again and again and again."}
{"text":"Ok, I know what you're thinking. Good barbecue in Illinois? Yes. Absolutely. This is some of the best bbq I have ever had. When you first walk in, you are to write your first name and party number on a white board and wait to be seated. The wait was not too bad, but we came on a Monday for lunch. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was very friendly and didn't mind suggesting things. Try the burnt ends. Delicious. The twice baked potato casserole was excellent too. It was all great. I only give it a 4 star because of the seating. It's a little crammed, but it won't affect your dining experience at all."}
{"text":"Not that big of a place so you may have to wait.   Cornbread app is interesting flavorful. 5 stars for the beef brisket, very moist BBQ chicken and the burnt tips.  If you like spicy-ish sauce go with the Carolina.  If you like sweet and awesome try the Georgia peach.   Yum"}
{"text":"Good food everytime and solid service. Could use more bbq sauce for tripple platters...but everything comes out fast and hot usually. Its expensive but worth the price. Highly recommend everyone try their food."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Apparently, Black Dog is among the top 5 BBQ places in the country according to different national reviews. Everything tasted great, especially the pulled pork and sides. Even the sweet tea was delicious. Only complaint: the portion sizes were surprisingly small for the high prices. Waiter was attentive and nice. Ambiance was also nice."}
{"text":"Great freaking BBQ!!! it's not the sauce, it's the smoked meat! Best Brisket I've had for sure! Tender like no other!! The wait may be long, but worth it. Drove by last night and didn't want to wait cuz of the big crowds waiting outside...yup regretting it now! Could have tried some of their other faire...now wishing I had a bigger belly to stuff with brew and BBQ."}
{"text":"I often frequent Black Dog for lunches away from work. They can get really busy and have very little seating, which is off-putting for some, but I don't mind it. I LOVE the cornbread with chilis and pulled pork in it, but it's not for everyone. Their BBQ sauces are awesome! I could eat a shoe if it was dipped in some Hot Georgia Peach. Their smoked turkey is amazing - which surprised me because I hate turkey but had to try it when I was drooling over someone else's meal. I've tried most proteins on the menu and sandwiches - I've never been let down. Only once have a thought the meat was a little skimpy, but it's not like I left hungry. I've been very happy with the service every time I've come as well. Everybody I've encountered has been friendly and that only adds to the dining experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my smoked salmon. I used Carolina vinegar based sauce as the dressing on my smoked salmon salad. It was spicy, smoky deliciousness. My husband had the  burnt ends, tender and moist...if you barbeque, need I say more? Our waiter,Tim, was fantastic. It was the best barbeque we've had at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't been said. Great barbecue and great selection of craft beer. Always a wait so you have to be prepared to wait. But you can have a pint or two out front while waiting to hear your name. Smaller groups are seated faster..."}
{"text":"I love me some Black Dog. I've professed this love all over the community and Yelp. That was before Black Dog Champaign. I've visited this location many a time. Unfortunately for me, I've had some sort of issue with each visit. None too serious, most likely due to it being fairly new and new staff. On my visit today, dun dun dun, however, we received exceptionally crummy service. I believe the server was new and just really slow at everything. He would walk away from our table mid-sentence while working on the tablet and go talk to another table before doing the same to them and wandering back. That was interesting and entertaining. The food came out and it was a-okay. My beer choice (Avery - The Czar) was superb. Our server was still really struggling with his pace when we needed to pay. We asked for separate bills but to split the corn bread. (There was no meat in it today. Boo!) He left for several minutes and then asked for our cards. As soon as we had a printed copy, he was gone and I then saw that my portion was $25 for a sandwich and half a cornbread. I mean, Black Dog is good, but what?? There was a mystery burger on my bill that I needed to get out of my life. Nobody ordered a burger! This is black dog! We waited 10 minutes for our server to make an appearance so I could question the billing issue. No show. I then requested a manager from a nearby server (I bet that is the most dreaded thing ever!) and a girl came over asking what my issue was. Explained that my printed receipt showed my food, my guest's food, and a mystery cheeseburger with pepperjack cheese. Nice choice, BTW. The manager said the receipt just printed all our items together on my copy. Clearly that wasn't the issue due to said burger. Confused, she spent 20 minutes behind the bar talking with other employees trying to figure this out. I begrudgingly approached the bar and asked if it would be much longer since I'm on my lunch hour. I was informed she was still trying to figure it out. Now, here I think would be an appropriate time to offer a gift card for the amount overpaid (DAMN YOU MYSTERY BURGER) or issue a partial refund. Nope. I'm still sweating while I look at the clock because if you knew my boss, man, you would not be late from lunch either. Five painfully long minutes went by and finally I was told I will be refunded for the burger. Really? I already know that since we didn't order it. Why am I now over 30 minutes late back to work all because of a billing error? Correct it, get my butt out of there and out of your hair. The manager was catty and defensive when I asked why I was only being refunded for the burger after this 30 minute cluster. Definitely not the service that is received at Black Dog Urbana. The original is still where the heart is and everyone's favorite pretty, pretty princess."}
{"text":"Two words... Beef ribs... They were amazing and I knew I was going to get them as soon as I saw them on the menu. I tried them with the Georgia peach and Texas sauces and both were great. Baked beans were awesome and the mac n cheese was only decent. I tried someone's fries and they were very good. The decor and ambiance were great. I will definitely be back next time I'm in central Illinois."}
{"text":"Food, the barbecue, was OK. Really appreciate the good sauce. Some of the meat was dry considering what I ordered really no excuse for that. Waitress decent, speaking to customers politely and efficiently. Bearded guy as a greeter leaves a lot to be desired. Not appreciating much his attempts at 'humor.'

Pretentious atmosphere and overpriced. 

Not worth the stop."}
{"text":"Excellent, love this little quaint place.  This was my first time and I fell totally in love with this place.  It fills up fast but is worth the wait.  Their food was excellent.  I had the brisket.....best brisket ever!!!  I also had the corn bread....wonderful.  A must if u are in the area.  Too bad I'm over a hundred miles away."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. The Urbana store  is very small and always has a wait. The champaign store isn't open yet, but does take out orders. Can't wait until the new location opens!!"}
{"text":"good ass food---sweet potato fries are crispy.---ribs and pulled pork were really nice---great beer selection"}
{"text":"This place is really good and probably the best in Urbana...  
The sweet potato fries are my favorite and deserve 6 STARS!!  :)  Their ranch dressing is amazing..  To me the BBQ is a bit spicy.. Even the mildest  one. But overall I feel this place is worth the wait, although when its REALLY crowded we just get the order to go, and its quicker.."}
{"text":"I recently moved away from Urbana and had to bid farewell to Black Dog (at least inasmuch as I will be able to go there frequently). I never bothered to review Black Dog on Yelp because, frankly, what is there to add to the veritable torrent of 5-star reviews here.

Last week, though, I had occasion to travel to Kansas City (the self-proclaimed BBQ capital of the world) and made every effort to take in the best the city had to offer (a set of restaurants that naturally varies greatly depending on the Kansas City resident being asked). I had ribs and brisket at Oklahoma Joe's (in the gas station); ribs and burnt ends at Arthur Bryant's; and ribs and a burnt end sandwich at Q39. All were good, some even great (Q39 especially), but--and here is the point of my review--I found myself thinking constantly of Black Dog even as I was downing these admittedly famous and stellar BBQ items.

Black Dog, in my mind, is really unmatched in its ability to offer outstanding BBQ at all times of the day and across the entire menu. From the ribs and burnt ends to the pulled pork, pulled rib sandwich, pulled chicken, and brisket, everything is truly wonderful. The sides, too--from the twice-baked potato to the pit beans--are excellent.

I will admit that Kansas City's Q39 beat Black Dog in one area: ribs. The ribs at Q39 were quite simply the best I've ever had. But, even at Q39, I found myself wishing for every other aspect of Black Dog: the sides (which were sorely lacking everywhere in Kansas City), the price, and the other BBQ items. 

Writing this is the only way I could think of to add something new to the many compliments and superlatives about Black Dog on Yelp. So yes: even after a BBQ journey to KC, I remain steadfast in my belief that Black Dog is, hands down, the best BBQ restaurant out there. It doesn't get caught up in or weighed down by tradition or legacy. Instead, it has every aspect of BBQ honed to perfection and is clearly the result of careful planning by the owners, taking as they must have the best elements of BBQ throughout the U.S. and putting them together under the moniker Black Dog Smoke and Ale House."}
{"text":"What's left to say about Black Dog?  It has become a Mecca for BBQ lovers all over the country.  I have friends who make special trips, when they can, from Texas, just to come have some BBQ, spend the night, and head back the next day.

Don't let the haters fool you, folks, Black Dog is *THAT* good.  Good luck getting some burnt ends, as they run out the moment they're available ...but if you have the chance, seriously - do it.  Words cannot describe.

My typical trip to Black Dog consists of a double-meat platter:  Brisket + Pulled Pork.  Two sides: Twice Baked Potato Casserole + Pulled Pork Corn Bread.  Chipotle BBQ.  Regular Iced Tea...I could eat this for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, every day, and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"Black Dog is definitely a must during your time in Urbana/Champaign. They began with their small restaurant in Urbana, and it ALWAYS had a long wait to get in. If you wanted a seat for dinner, you had to show up at 4pm to attempt to beat the dinner crowd. 

They opened their Champaign location recently and it is definitely a result of their popularity. The food seriously is delicious. They have a lot of various types of meats and BBQ sauces, and yummy sides. If you are wanting a salad or something on the healthier side, you won't find much of that here. 

If you haven't been here though, add it to your list! It's one to check out for sure."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a glorious cavern of mustachioed waiters, succulent meats and flavorful sides (that might contribute to well-worth-it wait gain) look no further.  Black Dog Smoke & Ale House offers up some of the best pulled pork to have ever graced my taste buds.  If you make it in time to enjoy the glorious burnt ends, first thank the gods, and then savor the flavors because you may never have the chance to taste them again. All in all, if you are willing to wait to get a seat you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum!!! This was my first time going to Black Dog. Why have I not been coming here!?! Loved the brisket, it was delicious!!! Really wanted the burnt ends but they ran out and it was only noon. Looks like I will need to come in earlier to grab those! The baked potato casserole was so good too! I may stop back in, in a few days haha"}
{"text":"Far and away the best barbeque I've had in Champaign.   The smoked wings are mindblowingly tasty.  Thinking about them makes me feel funny in my pants."}
{"text":"I'm not a BBQ fan, but this was amazing! I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The wait is well worth it!!  Super quick service and friendly staff!  Get there early enough to get some burnt ends! Be sure to try the cornbread!!"}
{"text":"To me BBQ flavor is judged without sauce. This offering is wonderful. The sauce is an enhancement. The sweet potato was tops. Wished this place was near home."}
{"text":"Ugh, finally found rude in the Champaign/Urbana dinning circuit.  Sorry was treated fairly rude by the hostess on Friday night 05/16/14, then it turned up a notch when we were ignored at the bar seating for another 15 minutes. If you value customer service, this is not your place.  Leave it for the college kids that don't know what good food or good service is.  Hickory River is the only place i will go from now on, customer service cannot be beat and they have an absolutely fantastic pull-pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Just tried new location on Sunday 1.31.2016, unfortunately some of the same bad attitudes from the Urbana location came to Champaign. First hostess kept looking for reasons not to accommodate us luckily a sweetheart of a hostess rescued us. Then after being seated at the bar we couldnt get acknowledged for over 15 minutes. When i waived to a  female with tatoos on her arm, she proceeded to interrogate us about if the hostess sat us at the bar or did we seat ourselves. This went around twice before a really nice male bartender waited on us. Food was average burnt ends and pit beans. Really dont need to return based on the overall treatment."}
{"text":"Simply the tops. Black Dog presents to you the best BBQ in a 50-state area. Its welcoming and knowledgeable staff will serve you a rotating cast of beers and a stable of meats and sauces that rivals anywhere you've ever been. The burnt ends are probably considered to be the specialty here, and they're typically out of them by 1 or 2 due to the popularity, but the true specialty is just outstanding, mouthwatering food. Aside from the everyday options of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and catfish, they also have great daily specials, such as pork tacos on Tuesday and an incredible cuban sandwich on Wednesday. And not to be forgotten, the sides and appetizers are killer as well.

The long wait at usual dinner and lunch hours is well documented, but there is a wait because everyone who's heard of the place dreams of eating all of their meals there, all of the time.

If you're stopping in for the first time, you'll never go wrong with a cornbread appetizer, sides of pit beans and twice baked potato casserole, and pulled pork with the georgia peach sauce."}
{"text":"Best food in CU.

Excellent cornbread with peppers and pulled pork baked into it.  Pulled pork & briskets are both good, the burnt tips are the best item but they run out quickly at lunch and dinner.  A few excellent sauces. My fave: hot georgia peach, but the carolina vinegar & mustard are good.  The sides are good:  excellent slaw, good baked beans, & decent potato salad. Great beer selection, better brown liquor selection. As a bonus, they occasionally have neat add ons like smoked ice (turns your bourbon into scotch). 

The downside: the restaurant selection in CU is so impoverished that Black Dog is always crowded, and I mean crowded as heck (this includes a Thurs at 2pm in late May after the undergrads left). My tip: get takeout.  It's inexpensive (especially because you're saving the cost of alcohol). Just don't get the fries as a side."}
{"text":"Tried to get into this place and the line was horrendous.....unfortunately I didn't have time to wait.  Second visit presented the same dilemma but this time i had plenty of time and it was well worth the wait.  The cornbread is a meal in itself and pretty amazing!!  Relaxed place to go, I sat at the bar and it was fun watching the action in the kitchen.  Service was fabulous and they were patient with all my questions.  Will definitely return and will be sure I have time to wait!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and had the brisket with the mild Georgia peach sauce. It was absolutely amazing! It was so tender and juicy. Melts in your mouth! The twice baked potato was a little boring, but it was still good! Others in my party had the smoked salmon and the meatloaf which they also said was very very good. 

Be prepared for wait. It's very small and the wait at 4:30 on Saturday was about 1.5 hours... Once your seated though, your food comes quickly! 

Deffinently can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of high regard for the place and I figured wife and I would be disappointed and didn't feel like waiting in the line.  Figured it was more hype than actual goodness.  I was wrong.

The wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.

Sat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service.  Not the world's best BBQ, but very good.  The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal.  The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish.  Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good.  Wife had the brisket and was impressed.  Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.

Serving size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers.  Definitly a worth while visit.

Great staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food.  What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good BBQ cuisine in the Champaign-Urbana area, look no further than Black Dog!!! It is UNBELIEVABLE!! Get there earlier in the day to make sure you get an order of burnt ends. They are so popular that supplies does not last very long. It is a small restaurant, so there is usually a bit of a wait. However, IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever, hands down! We shared the burnt tips for an appetizer with the peach sauce. oh my gosh, amazing. There were 6 of us, so we had quite a sampling of entrees. The chicken was so tender and juicy, the spareribs outstanding, beef brisket just as good.... our sides were great, too. From standard fries to twice-baked potato casserole to corn bread, everything was sublime. Well worth the 40 min wait!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Go for the flight of sauces.

Sadly they have long lines ALL of the time."}
{"text":"Black Dog was amazing. I typically don't like smoked food and was worried at first if I would like the restaurant because of this, but it succeeded all expectations. We waited in line for about 15 minutes, but it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Black Dog isn't my typical restaurant of choice, considering I don't eat much meat or smoked things. However, I heard great reviews about the place so naturally I had to check it out. My thoughts on the restaurant changed very quickly. The first time I went I visited the original establishment in downtown Urbana, it was a small place and after going a few times I quickly noticed it was always packed full of people.

This past time I went to eat here, a friend and I went to the new restaurant in downtown Champaign and enjoyed our experience tremendously. This one is a lot bigger than the Urbana location. 

My favorite go-to meal (and always what I seem to end up ordering time after time) is the chicken salad sandwich. It's amazingly delicious and comes with sweet potato fries that are to-die-for. I am glad to have surpassed my initial disinterest in the restaurant and to have stepped outside my boundaries to try the place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Pork was perfectly tender. Ribs had just right amount of chew. You get to choose from several different sauces, many with a mango or peach base. Bit tough to get in but service was quick and friendly. Food came out fast and we were never thirsty."}
{"text":"I think this place is good, and I enjoy going here, but I don't think it's the best BBQ I've ever had.

The meat is cooked well, smoky and tender, but the thing that doesn't do it for me is the sauce (there's a few choices). I haven't tried them all, but I haven't found one I like.

The side dishes are quite good though, namely the cornbread, beans (so smoky and delicious) and sweet potato fries. 

This place is small and always packed, so be prepared to get there when it first opens or during non-peak times (or just be prepared to wait, in other words, stand against the wall and watch others eat three feet in front of you)."}
{"text":"Maybe I just over-hyped this place in my mind, but I felt sort of let down after eating at Black Dog.  I had the beef brisket sandwich and the double baked potato side--both good, but definitely not great.  I came here at 1 PM on a Wednesday and missed out on the \"burnt ends\", so a chance to try those may bring me back to give this place another shot.  That said, it's a good place to grab a quick, cheap lunch--definitely a nice change of pace from any chain restaurant.  Oh, and they only had one bartender serving a packed bar, so the service was somewhat lacking."}
{"text":"Great food and a great price. Love the atmosphere. Ordered nine meals and not one complaint."}
{"text":"This has become one of my new favorite restaurants in Urbana. The food is very tasty and the service is friendly. The prices are very reasonable. I like the beef brisket and the pit beans.
My only complaints are that it gets very loud in there, and has bad acoustics. Also, I've noticed the food can be a bit inconsistent as I have the same meal almost every time. But other than that, I really like it."}
{"text":"I think my boyfriend and I eat here about three times a month. We live so close and its such a fun place to walk to now that the weather is getting warmer. We like to stop for a beer at the Sipyard just down the street, before (and sometimes after) we eat at Black Dog. We just got back from a weekend in Nashville, and honestly, the barbecue at Black Dog was very comparable (maybe even better?) than the barbecue we had down south. The brisket at Black Dog is the best we've had. It can be pricey, until you realize how big the portions are and how happy your belly is after you've eaten it. Black Dog in Urbana is a staple in our \"date night repertoire\" for sure!"}
{"text":"Before this review, I want to note that I am a big meat eater, but I am not from a location known for its barbeque. This may not be the review for you if you are from any of those areas.

I have been to Black Dog around ten times in the last year. I definitely prefer this bigger Champaign location over the one in Urbana. I normally order the combo platter. The brisket, burnt ends, and hot polish sausage have always been good. The ribs can be inconsistent - sometimes done well, other times with very little meat. The pulled pork is solid, but I have definitely had better. There are plenty of options for sides depending on your tastes. None of them are bad, but the Mac 'n Cheese is my favorite, especially with some of the Hot Georgia Peach BBQ sauce added on top.

One thing that could ruin your experience here is that they often run out of items. I went with friends once at around 7 or 8 p.m. and they did not have more than half of their meat options. 5 or 5:30 p.m. is the ideal time to go. That's around when they start serving burnt ends again after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for lunch and enjoyed on many levels. It's in a former railroad fright building and nicely restored. They have a nice touchpad check in to keep things organized, since they don't take reservations. The staff was also nice. 
We both got the brisket sandwich with a side of cornbread. Lots of flavor for both. 
Since we were there for lunch we didn't want to over order. The menu looked great and next time I'll try dinner!"}
{"text":"We arrived late, for this part of the world (around 9:00 pm), so they had run out of the \"burnt ends.\"  Carolyn ordered a portobella mushroom sandwich and reported that it was pretty good.  I went straight for the 1/2 slab of ribs, fries and beans.  Everything was lip smackin' good.  The ribs were a tad overcooked, but with the hot peach BBQ sauce, they tasted rather good.

The fries were among the best I've had.  That good.  I'd go back just to order fires.

The service, at the bar, was very good and the atmosphere just what you'd expected.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I felt like I was cheating as we drove by Hickory River, so I looked away.  Parking at Black Dog is sketchy - this time the lot was a sheet of ice.  But we got right in, only waiting 5 minutes for a table at 6pm.

We split way too many apps, but everything looked so darn good!!  Smoked almonds (house smoked, with a touch of sweetness - love, especially for $3!), wings (expensive but OK, with sauce that catches up with you around wing #3), Texas caviar (with black eyed peas and hominy - very nice) and chips and salsa (meh).  Drinks all around too.  I had a bloody mary made with horseradish vodka (yum) and a margarita made with hoppy tequila (yum!!!).

I ordered a combo plate.  $12 for your choice of two meats (I had burnt ends and pulled pork) and two sides (spicy potato salad and pit beans - both delish).  Really good amount of food for the price!  Others at my table had the brisket (dry), sweet potato fries (an upcharge but very worth it if you're a fan of them), the burger with brisket, sauce, onions and cheese on it (she loved it) and the twice-baked potato casserole (everyone wanted to lick this bowl clean).

This was my first time trying burnt ends, and I must say I was disappointed.  I expected blackened meat all around, like I've seen on the Food Network, and these were just the black ring around brisket that I normally get... when I order brisket.

We all loved the potato salad and the potato casserole.  In fact, we loved all the sides and apps.  If there was a way to get just a plate of sides, I'd never leave.

Hopping place!  A constant waiting line, on a Tuesday.  Good service, but a little scatterbrained."}
{"text":"This place is easily my FAVORITE bbq joint in Chambana. I was beyond pleased with the food when it first opened (before the liquor license even), and even more thrilled now that there is a full bar and decent beer selection. The last time I went, the restaurant was offering beer flights. It was my bad luck that the flight they had that week was all dark beers (not my fave) but they do change the offerings in the flight. I always get the burnt ends (when they're not sold out) and sweet potato fries, but the Cuban sandwich special is also delicious. PS - try the different bbq sauces!"}
{"text":"Even though myself and my girlfriend showed up around 5, there was already a line waiting to be seated.  This establishment is small, and if you are going around dinner time, be prepared to wait.  However, we found it to be well worth waiting for once we were seated (which was actually at a weird sort-of-bar at the back of the restaurant).  

I am not a barbecue aficionado, but this was definitely the best place I have ever been to.  I got a pulled pork sandwich, since I had read so much about it, and was definitely not disappointed (I was pleasantly surprised at the fact it was served with slaw on top).  My girlfriend got a brisket sandwich, which was very good, though I preferred my sandwich.  In addition, we got sweet potato fries, which were delicious.

They had a fairly extensive drink menu for a restaurant, though not quite as large as a few of the other establishments in the Champaign/Urbana area.  Their draft beer selection was good, and they had a good selection of bottled beer.  In addition to this, the service was both prompt and pleasant, and when I ordered a bottle of Lone Star after having Dogfish Head, the waitress (thankfully) talked me out of downgrading like that (I was... unfamiliar... with Lone Star, I guess it is like Budweiser).

Overall, I was very satisfied with this restaurant, and I plan on going again soon (though I have to pick a time when I'm not terribly hungry, due to the wait)."}
{"text":"Visited with a friend of mine when she was in town. Good place to go; waiting time was very long. I like their beef ribs; not quite like the duck."}
{"text":"I got the Combo platter with Pulled Pork and Burnt Ends with Pit Beans and Mac n Cheese as sides. I got them with Milos mustard sauce and Texas sauce.  Overall, I enjoyed the platter with the Burnt Ends stealing the show! It was soft and delicious and combined with the mustard sauce took me to BBQ heaven. Though it says mustard sauce,  it can be classified as a mild BBQ sauce with a kick to it.  Mac n Cheese wasn't the best I've had but the rest of the platter made up for it. Would definitely visit again for those delicious Burnt Ends!"}
{"text":"By far, the best resturant in Champaign-Urbaba. their back ribs is delicious. Their burns ends will melt in the mouth! Ask for the hottest sauce that is not on the menu ;)"}
{"text":"Went to the Black Dog tonight. 
45 minute wait (not their fault). 
Service was decent (except he forgot to input the order of the couple next to us at the bar). He gave us recommendations when we asked, checked to see if the Texas Caviar stuff had cilantro in it for us (it did...so we didn't get it).
The food though? Beef brisket was good, the mac and cheese was alright, the beans were ok at best, and my fiance had some portobello mushroom deal that she says was almost inedible.

I was hoping the long wait was going to mean that it was good.
I'd say The Black Dog was pretty much a bust.

On to the next Chambana restaurant for us."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! All the food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. There was a bit of a wait but it was just long enough doe everyone to finish a beer. I would definitely make a point to go back if I'm in the area again. We got the Texas Caviar appetizer and while I thought it would come out warm and creamy it was cold and more like a salsa. Still really good though! The pulled pork was awesome, and the bun was so soft. Everyone cleared their plates!"}
{"text":"Beyond amazing food and service. The owner is awesome and super friendly. Great selection of food and drinks. Great local business in the Champaign-Urbana community. The ONLY negative I have is that the restaurant is very small which means there is always a long line. But, if you ask me it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very quick service, though could be friendlier.  Great beer selection. Really good fries. Enjoyable experience overall. 

One annoyance was payment. They use handheld tablets for ordering and payment. You pay at the table through the tablet. However, I wasn't given the opportunity to review the bill prior to payment. Also, the suggested tip amount is calculated after tax, not before thereby inflating the tip amount. I felt payment was shady."}
{"text":"Delicious and perfect. I love the burnt ends and the Georgia Peach sauce. Come early, get amazing food!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken salad sandwich on multigrain bread with sweet potato fries. The chicken salad was good, but it was pretty smoky which is how it's described. The sweet potato fries were fresh and delicious. I also had a spicy Bloody Mary which was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem in Urbana for college students because every time I rave about this place to someone they were unfortunate to not have the black dog experience. 
First off, the BBQ sandwiches (I've tried them all) are all phenomenal! If you're a BBQ person there should be no reason for you to not try this place.
As a first timer, definitely try to get there early to get the burnt ends! They only have limited amounts made and the burnt ends do run out very quickly. 
Also, pay the extra 50 cents and get the sweet potato fries, honestly it will be the only place around the area that serve them and it is definitely a fresh new taste compared to the typical fries! I don't like sweet potatoes but these fries were worth trying!

My friends and I also got the wings as an appetizer once and I always order them now since they were so good! It comes with lots of meat & good flavor so get them to share so you have plenty of room for their entree

PLEASE don't pass this place up! I've taken many friends here and they have never been disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to come back to try out their dinner menu. Got the Combo Platter, 1/3 slab of ribs and 1/2 a chicken and two sides for 10.95, can't be beat. (They only serve these after 5pm). The ribs were pretty tender with a nice smokey char on the outside and the chicken was soft, mostly cuz it was dark meat but it also had a distinct smoked flavor that reminded me of lil porgies. They don't give you enough sauce to cover both of them, but they'll give you more if you just ask.

The red cabbage coleslaw was a little too sour for me, but boy...the sweet potatoe fries are pretty awesome, I couldn't get enough of them!! Sweet, crunchy, potatoey...with a little bit of that sauce...ooo...i'm drooling right now and it's morning.

Now I can confidently say that it's one of the better places on campus for bbq and I'll be coming back for their full rack of ribs in the next week or two."}
{"text":"Oh My! This is the BEST BBQ that I have ever had! I love the burnt ends! The fat of the meat just brings you a very special taste! And we also ordered the smoked sweet potato, sweet potato fries, pulled pork, beef brisket,they are all out of our expectation! So good! Will come back!"}
{"text":"I hit Black Dog on the rave recommendations of several friends.  They speak the truth.  Black Dog is the bomb.*

When you show up, you'll notice the place is packed.  Walk up to the slab of paper, grab a sharpie and write your name down.  You'll be called when there's room for you to begin your BBQuest.

A sign near the entryway notified us they were out of burnt ends and mac 'n' cheese.  We mourned this loss and regrouped in time to be seated.

Let's start with the cornbread.  You can order it as a side to your main dish or as an appetizer.  The appetizer portion ($2.95) is solid enough for two people.  The cornbread contains green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork.  Boom.  Regular bread is forever ruined.

If you like sauces, Black Dog allows you to order a flight of all eight of theirs for just $2.  Milo's Mustard and Carolina Red were my favorite.

For my main dish, I went with a 3 meat combo.  Ribs, chicken and brisket.  Chicken was my favorite.  Succulent, soft and juicy, it paired very nicely with any sauce, but it was a home run with the mustard.

The ribs were appropriately soft and smoky.  I really loved these with the Carolina Red sauce.

The brisket was good, but not particularly outstanding.

I live in Chicago, but Black Dog is good enough to merit a two and a half hour drive.  If you're in the area, you have to check out this temple of meat!

* Saying things are \"the bomb\" was a popular expression in the early 2000s.  Despite its rapid decline in coolness, some people still use it earnestly.  Others use it ironically.  You are free to decide the context in this review."}
{"text":"Just after we were seated a large party next to us left and the waitress chose to separate 2 tables by dragging them on the floor and then dragging the chairs too.  Wasn't really music to the ears.  Combine that with the loud noise of a waiter (Steven) clattering glasses as he grabbed 8/10 of them with his fingers in each glass; was loud and appeared rather unhygienic. The food was good; we ordered 2, 3-choice platters; the amount of sauce served with each platter isn't really sufficient.  We ordered a flight of sauces with the second platter and that helped.  The burnt ends were mediocre.  When I asked for the tab, Steven brought his tablet and showed me a total with no detail.  When I asked him for a print out he made it a point to tell me showing the tablet was the \"normal\". One of the owners (an old friend) was kind enough to stop and check in on us.  The staff needs to step it up a notch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing 90/90 sweet lemonade steakhouse style pork
Amazing I have love this place in the future and back Black dog is amazing I think people should try It. I have many other stuff don't worry it's good it's amazing 10 out of 10 and 90 out of 90 should
 try it it's a me and it's amazing everyone should try it just once it is a relief to eat the smooth bbq pork.

{"text":"We had the bacon wrapped spicy meatloaf and beef brisket sandwich with the twice baked potato casserole.  Everything was great and fast service. Easy location to find. There is parking beside the building and empty lots could be RV parking nearby. Public parking lot for camper one block away too. Its street behind the restaurant. Nice downtown too."}
{"text":"Never had better. Brisket and wings were spectacular. Great beer matches for all the BBQ here. Unpretentious, friendly environment with staff and customers to match."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Very good, not spectacular. The ribs were smoky but still kind of tough and the house sauce wasn't a great complement. I heard good things about the burnt ends but they were sold out. The brisket was outstanding; I'd come back again and again for it. Worth the visit alone.

Their potato souffle thing was overcooked and average. Beans were reheated in the microwave and the foam container melted, kind of gross looking but the beans were decent. 

Service isn't too friendly, but I never judge places based upon if they smile or not as long as the food comes out hot, and in this case it was so hot the container side melted."}
{"text":"I went to Black Dog on a recent visit to C-U.  Based on the reviews here, I was expecting a long wait, but got lucky and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (I'm sure the miserable weather had something to do with that).  I can be a touch critic when it comes to BBQ - having spent years living in the southeast and in Texas, I'm familiar with both BBQ traditions.  Since everything looked so good, I had to get a combination plate.  My ribs were just so-so - I got the small end, and the meat had gotten pretty dried out, and were perhaps a tad over-seasoned.  They did have a decent smoke flavor though, and I imagine that if I had gotten the larger pieces I would have liked them significantly better.  The brisket (my usual favorite) was not particularly good - it was so lean that it had become dry and tough.  However, the burnt ends really stole the show.  In case you aren't familiar, they are chunks of the brisket point (not really \"burnt\", but they spend some extra time in the smoker giving more smoke flavor, and they don't get overly dry because of their higher fat content).  They had great flavor, with an ideal, tender-but-not-too-tender texture. 

My sides were good - surprisingly good fries (skinny cut with a seasoned surface) and apples (a nice complement to BBQ that doubles as a dessert).  None of the sauces stood out to me, but it was nice that they had a variety.  If you want to try extra, you can get \"half-and-half\" if you ask - smaller portions of two different sauces - otherwise, they do charge extra.  It is a little on the pricey side for BBQ, but given the relative lack of quality options in C-U (and the fact that they're always so busy), I can't fault them for that too much."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've had in the area, and probably the state of Illinois.  There are two locations, but the Urbana spot is the better in my opinion because it's the original, and the people working there are really enjoyable.  You may have to put your name down and wait a bit, but it's worth it.

My wife and I usually start with the wings, and then order a platter for the entree.  Honestly, the platter is the way to go.  You get 2-3 meats and 2 sides.  I've had everything, and the only food I didn't love was the green beans--everything else is amazing.

Pro-tip: get the sauce flight and dip your different meats in all the glorious sauces they have. It makes the sauce decision a lot easier.  My favorite is to get fries as a side and dip it in their mustard sauce.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Although I cannot boast a lifelong relationship with BBQ, I know what my taste buds are fans of, and Black Dog is it. Wednesdays are Cuban sandwiches and a side of the twice-baked potato. We have been here for dinner as well, when I had the privilege of eating a delicious polish. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and on top of things. My only complaint is how busy they are, but the food is so good that I will not withhold stars just because it takes me a few minutes to get seated."}
{"text":"Food is good not great. I think some of the fun is the fact that you ALWAYS have to wait at least 1 hour even at 3PM when you would think that you could get in no problem. My carnivore friend loves it though so I go with him and stand there wondering WHY, but keep going back anyway."}
{"text":"Whoever visit Champaign-Urbana first time, this place is a 101 restaurant for them.  All kinds of BBQ are great , but also various craft beers are also good."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Everything was very good. My favorite was the black dog burger with the Georgia peach BBQ sauce. The burnt ends were good but a pretty small app. The collard greens and sweet potato fries were my favorite sides. The applesauce and meatloaf special were overrated for me but my brother loved it! Order to go if you want to have a slightly less exhausting wait."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with most anything on the menu - yeah, even the falafel and smoked polish (I suggest Milo's mustard sauce) are great.  Not a huge fan of the portobello  sandwich nor the ribs.  The staff is great.  Beer selection is regularly changing, not that I drink beer that often but its fun to go in a get the dog bone flight to try new things.  
The late night menu is also awesome.  They make, in house some of them, different kinds of hot dogs and other tasty crazy tid bits that may only hang around for a week or so.  One of my faves was a smoked tomato soup where they smoked all the ingredients, it was meatless and awesome!
They also host special dinner throughout the year.  I've attended a few and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic burnt ends.  It can be a long wait.  Go early and stay awhile"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!! Super friendly wait staff and excellent food! So glad we stopped in here!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of BBQ and was excited to try this place. I got pulled pork, burnt ends, and ribs. The pork was a little more dry than I like, the burnt ends are amazing! (Will keep me coming back) the ribs were a total let down, too dry and chewy.  The sauces are great but they default to one so be sure to tell them what you want."}
{"text":"I am so sad I don't live in Urbana anymore! This is the best barbecue I've ever had. Whatever, I know, \"don't overhype,\" but for the price and location it is fantastic.

Best dishes: Burnt ends, which are smoked for twelve hours (!) and usually sell out at some point during the lunch shift (comes with the Carolina sauce, which is a bit spicy but genuinely amazing). Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, and a peach barbecue sauce that has ruined every other blue burger I have tried so far. South Carolina burger, which has the same Carolina sauce as the burnt ends and comes with barbecue pork on top (no, it is not good for your cholestorol, but it it is totally worth it). Barbecue salmon (available as a special certain days) that seems strange in concept but basically melts into the barbecue sauce, and is (I assume) the healthiest option you'll come across. Also, the buns are weirdly good? I don't understand, but I appreciate it.

Drinks: Go with a craft beer or whiskey list -- the options are many. I love the beer flights, as well.

Sides: The cornbread is out of control. It comes with small bits of barbecue pork baked in. Also, it is the size of a piece of pie, so consider splitting. I would get a side of carolina sauces to dip in, it is amazing. Also, the baked beans are flavorful and made me like baked beans. 

Not as crazy about: The wait time, because it's a small space and the best casual dining in town. I would consider going at opening or in the mid-day lull. But I think they're opening a new location. Also, not a huge fan of the brisket (which is cool, because everything else is life changing)."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places I have ever been at. On Sunday, I visited my son and it was his choice to impress me, and yes he did. Excellent BBQ sauce, Georgia peach. I got mild, and he loves his to be spicy. We ordered pulled pork, rib tips, chicken wings, and the beef brisket, everything was to die for. 
My son was raving about the corn bread. He even made me try it for the first time in my life, and i loved it. (But I am just not that big of a fan of corn bread) 
Strangely nice decor, great organization, and sitting. 
There is always a line, but it goes fast, and is definitely worth the wait.
Excellent service 

Please visit, enjoy, and tip everyone."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Small, quaint, and unique! Check in by signing your name on a board, they call them in order and as long as your entire party is there you will be seated. If you aren't there they simply skip over you and when you come back you move to the head of the line. The food was excellent and we did try a little bit of everything. We had the chicken salad with crackers and chips and salsa as appetizers! We had the meatloaf special, ribs, triple combo platter, and grilled turkey sandwich as entrees. Everything tasted delicious! We enjoyed the great service and cool atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot, try the \"Burned Ends\"! They are amazing. You can select two meats and 2 sides with sauces, i like how you can mix and match things. Service was good, not a fan of all the sauces they offer but everything else was great. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Black dog is seriously worth the wait. I came during lunch on a weekend and had a 30-40 minute wait, but the food came out quite quickly and the staff are so nice that it didn't matter.

I ordered the brisket sandwich, slaw on the side with cornbread. I don't think I could've ordered anything better because I was in actual BBQ heaven. While I wanted to get the burnt ends I was unfortunately out of luck as they had already sold out - I have heard rave reviews from all my die-hard friends and one day I will get my hands on those meaty bits of goodness. 

For those that are looking to drink, they have a pretty diverse selection of beer to choose from, and it's constantly changing. I got the Green Flash double stout which I'd definitely recommend if it's still on the menu! 

A++ BD."}
{"text":"nearly a legend in Champaign-Urbana.  Great atmosphere and super food."}
{"text":"A warm atmosphere, delicious inexpensive food, Black Dog is easily my favorite restaurant in Central Illinois. Order the pulled pork sandwich with the house sauce and sweet potato fries. Sometimes the wait can be long, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Straight up amazing. I eat here at least twice a month. Not only do they have great food but also a great beer selection. There is usually a wait but they turn tables fast and  the food is so good it is beyond worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"The best bbq place I have ever been to. The burnt ends are to die for and their cornbread is so good. It gets really crowded fast because there aren't many seats, so I recommend getting there early for meals. You have to go here!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal. We happen to be in a hurry and they were very accommodating to get us in and out within 30 mins. The pork was smoked to perfection. I also had the house made slaw, very good. The second side was cinnamon applesauce. Yum. I would defiantly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"I really really want to give this place 5 stars because the food is absolutely delicious. If you can get the burnt ends, it basically dissolves in your mouth. However my only issue with this place is the portion sizes. The amount they bring out after 45 minutes - 1 hour wait is almost what you would expect a kids size to be. Typically when I think of good bbq I think of being able to gorge into the melt-in-your-mouth meat. Although black dog's has got the melt-in-your-mouth part down, I find myself having to limit each bite. Personally, this isn't how I expect a great bbq experience to be. However that's the only issue I have and I can't argue with how the food tastes. It's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Being from KC, I'm pretty critical of bbq, but I decided to give this place a try while visiting Urbana for work.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and the meat was divine.  The sauce was pepperier than what I'm used to, but still good.  The sweet potato fries were very good.  I had take-out, but I would definitely go back and dine-in next time.  Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Burnt End is very good but must go at 11AM or 5PM for it. There maybe a little wait but always worth the wait. We always bring out-of-town friends to show what's in Chambana."}
{"text":"The ribs were amazing. But that's where it all came to a stop. The catfish was DRY and almost burnt. I'm from NOLA and while I may have unrealistic standards... I also know what catfish should taste like. The cornbread was made with beans... And very dark. Just give me basic cornbread like most places in the South. Mac and cheese was good. The twice baked potato was also dry.

I'll only be back for ribs.

Also -- I went a 2nd time for ribs, and there is no \"just ribs\" option. You have to get sides as well."}
{"text":"Very solid BBQ spot with a great beer menu and fun atmosphere! I started with a watermelon flavored beer that hit the spot given how hot is was outside. Their two meat combo plate was excellent and I chose the catfish, ribs, green beans and mac & cheese. The portions were just right and they also let you pick from a variety of BBQ sauces - the peach was great! I'm not in Champaign IL often but hope to swing back to this spot that the locals seem to love."}
{"text":"Had been looking forward to trying Black Dog for years.  Finally got a chance yesterday.  Not too crowded, waited about half an hour.  Finally a table opened up by the front, they cleaned it, the hostess gathered up the menus,... and a guy walked in and asked if there was a wait for 2.  No, she had an open one if they didn't mind being in the back.  So she seated them.  Then a lady walked in with a baby and a little girl.  She signed in, but the staff clearly knew her, came to see the baby.  We waited.  The hostess wandered around; we waited some more.  Finally another table left, the hostess went back and cleaned it, and she took us to that table in the very back, next to the restrooms.  I asked to have the table in the front that we had been waiting for, but she told us that table had already been given away.  To the lady who had walked in two minutes earlier.  How rude was that?  We had waited for quite a while.  She spent the rest of our time there pretending we didn't exist, not making any eye contact even though she walked right towards us to clean the booth next to ours.  We never got an apology or anything.  The waitress was very nice, food was fine, but we will never be back.  Too bad, because I had really been looking forward to this.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"The bar is beautiful and looks like it has a ton of options! Unfortunately that is all I say because my fiancé and I sat at the bar for such a long time without being server that we left. The hostess was polite. Greeted us and sat us at the bar like we asked. We looked over the menu which took longer than normal since we wanted to see what they had to offer. Still none of the 3 people behind the bar acknowledge us. There was only 1 other person sitting at the bar.  Several tables, but no enough to overwhelm the staff. We got annoyed and started looking around. Props to the hostess who came back (approximately ten minutes after she sat us) and asked if anyone had helped us yet. We told her no and she went the the group of 3 people behind the bar with their backs turned and let them know. They still did not come greet us right away! We gave it another 60 seconds. We were done. We got up put our coats on and one of the people turned around, started washing a piece of glassware, and FINALLY said I will be right with you. At that point we had waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged, were standing up to leave, and had our coats on. I left hungry and disappointed.  Place looks nice and the host cared about the customers at least. Unfortunately, we won't be giving that location a second chance soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner tonight-- we both had delicious beers-- the scotch ale for me, and the wheat for him.  Both were great, the waitress was very nice and prompt, and the food was absolutely delicious.  I had the pulled pork, and it melted in my mouth.  Plus, sweet potato fries were only $.50 extra, compared to the $1.50 extra they are at crane alley.  

They have a great beer selection, and you can smell the place like a block away... the sweet, sweet smell of gluttony (and I'm sure most of the other 7 deadly sins)... and it's great.

All in all, 2 sandwiches, 3 beers, 20% tip and all under $30? Good in my book!"}
{"text":"I have had BBQ food all over the country and NONE of them even come close to the quality of the food at Black Dog in Urbana. If you haven't been, the wait is well worth it. If they aren't out, get the burnt ends, but everything on the menu is delicious. 

I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever. 

Chicken wings taste like they were cooked over a campfire, after eating them my hands smell good for hours. Sweet potato fries are probably the best I've ever had.
Last time I went, they had a smoked portobella mushroom sandwich which is nice because before the only vegetarian option was grilled cheese (and the aforementioned sweet potato fries, and a couple other sides.)
Large beer menu - not a perk for me since I don't drink beer- but my friends love it.
Over all, fantastic place. oh and awesome service too. Always have been overly friendly. Wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after my friends all raved about it. We arrived and there was a brief wait. I figured, hmmm...there are people here...that's a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. 

Here's what I got:
-combination platter with catfish, brisket, sweet potato fries, and double baked potatoes (for how much I paid I was expecting a larger portion; brisket was good; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - didn't really care for it; I had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries!! Grr. The twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it)
-burnt ends (DELISH)

The food was a disappointment but the service was even worst! The server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it wasn't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she didn't like it. IM SORRRY YOUR DRINKS AREN'T GOOD. You never attack the customer! So rude. He should've apologized and offered her another drink. Later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction! I was stunned. 

Overall, the food and service left much more to be desired..."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in central Illinois hands down. You'll come back until you've tried everything and keep coming back to get your favorites.  Seriously, there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"All of the food is great. You definitely need to come here if you're ever in Champaign. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich with Georgia peach sauce but I've also had rib tips and those are flame too. Only thing that is annoying is the wait and the fact that you can't make a reservation but I guess there's not a lot you can do about that considering it's a super popular place."}
{"text":"tried it once, great food, but they run out of the popular items quite often. (they're replenished twice a day at 11AM and 5PM)"}
{"text":"So glad this place expanded into a large restaurant in Champaign! The burnt-ends nachos are phenomenal. Friendly staff, great service, and they live up to the hype. The mustard barbecue sauce is outstanding and goes well on pretty much anything. 

Even for people who claim they aren't that big into barbecue (not too many of those), there is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"The food here is LEGIT. The prices are pretty good. Their beer selection is kind of weird but hey try something new."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try out Black Dog after receiving so many recommendations, and it didn't disappoint. One of the best places to eat in Chambana. I got the pulled pork and brisket. Both had great flavor and were very tender. The brisket was some of the best I've ever had. But the real stars were the sides. The cornbread is great and had pieces of pulled pork in it. Their twice baked potato casserole was easily my favorite part of the meal.

I recommend getting there early as they were very busy and they sold out of Burnt Ends quickly (going to have to go back and to try them. Overall a great, authentic BBQ place that does it right."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 than a 4. 

We ordered the burnt ends appetizer (4 small pieces for $7?! They were definitely soft but the size threw me off) and I ordered the chicken with a side of sweet potatoes (good, a little dry on the chicken)."}
{"text":"Ive lived in Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi. Having eaten more than my fair share of bbq in each of those states the Black Dog Smoke and Ale House in podunk Illinois is the best Ive had so far! BEWARE, theres never been a time ive gone to the Black Dog and not had to wait at least 30 min."}
{"text":"REALLY good bbq.  Lots of sauces from which to choose. Excellent dining experience. They'll bring you another sauce if the first one you chose isn't to your liking!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Black Dog.  I have heard great things and decided to try it for myself.  When I first walked in, I was shocked by how many beers they actually had on tap.  Your eye immediately goes towards the bar.  I finally got a table and ordered my food which was a cool processes as it is all done through a tablet.  The food was great but I was kind of disappointed by the amount of food that you get for the price you pay.  Overall, I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I'm always up for BBQ, so when my group of coworkers planned on dinner at Black Dog, I knew I had to join!

Why choose 1 meat when you can get a 2- or 3-combo platter?  On that note, I chose the burnt ends and pulled pork, which are always my go-to meats.  I had high hopes, but the burnt ends were really charred and chewy on the crust and excessively fatty otherwise.  With the pork, it had this unexpectedly greasy, slick, plasticy feel, and it made me miss the likes of Smoque in Chicago. My other observation was that the portions of meat were rather skimpy, relative to what I've received at other establishments. 

Each platter comes with 2 sides, so I chose fries (basic, hard to mess up) and slaw (your healthiest choice of side here).  You also get to choose the kind of BBQ sauce you want, and I was satisfied with the mustard-based one.  Service was really attentive, and no hassle with getting separate checks.  The waiter handled everything on an iPad, and we could choose to have the receipt emailed or printed."}
{"text":"My can't miss place in Champaign-Urbana. Burnt ends and a bourbon flight are unbeatable."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away from Black Dog and it is always such a dinner treat (as if you couldn't tell from the line out the door)! Their rib tips and racks are to die for, and the sides are just as killer. If you're local or come to town often, I definitely recommend bringing it home. If not, you'll probably be waiting in a very long line for a table!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is the best place in C-U to get barbeque! If you're in a rush, get takeout. You'll likely be in line for a very long time during busy times and they don't take reservations!"}
{"text":"Listen, listen, listen, listen. I love eating. One of the reasons I love our community is the number of great restaurants and environments in which I can eat. And Black Dog is my #1 favorite of all those food-serving places. It's cozy, with friendly staff who give the place a neighborhood-bar feel. Come with a friend and you can get seated at the bar, even at peak time, without having to wait too long. Come with more than one friend and you'll have to wait, but DEAL WITH IT DAWG. Patience is a virtue, and pulled pork BBQ with Hot Georgia Peach will be in you soon."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!  We got the box seats and had an amazing time. The server was fantastic and encouraged us to order the burnt ends. I'm sure glad we did. Not the cheapest price for food but certainly worth it. You can't cut corners and keep this kind of quality. The sampler of sauce paired with the combos lets you try almost everything. We will certainly go again."}
{"text":"Went to Black Dog to visit with an old friend while he was in town. He got the pulled pork and I got the spicy bacon wrapped meatloaf. We both really enjoyed our meals, but that night we both ended up with incredibly bad food poisoning. Like, body aches, vomiting and insomnia bad. After 24 hours I still haven't been able to keep anything down. I'm not sure if it's because of the appetizer of wings, but basically everything was ready to go as soon as we ordered, which means it may have been sitting out. The location is nice and they move through tables quickly, and I've had it before without getting messed up but I can't recommend this place after this terrible experience."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch at Blackdog for the first time at the new place. We had Nachos with very good brisket
 and corn bread. Both were extra special treats. The waitress took very good care of us and we are going to put it on our regular rotation. Very good experience for us. We would recommend Blackdog to our family and friends"}
{"text":"Fear not, Black Dog totally lives up to the hype. I WISH there was a barbecue place in Chicago that even compared. 

I'm not one for moderation, so whenever I'm here I have to get everything that I really like. Which is a lot: Chicken wings, pulled pork, hot Georgia peach sauce, twice baked potato casserole, sweet potato fries, beans, and cornbread. I also like to get a flight of all of the sauces because even though the hot Georgia peach is pretty much one of the best things I have ever eaten, I like to dip my hunks of pork in all of the different flavors. Oh, and they have an awesome selection of craft beers and cocktails. 

One time I came here and ate so much that I couldn't eat anything else for 24 hours."}
{"text":"Black Dog, probably the best restaurant in Champaign-Urbana.

Love that they serve the food on metal platters; no frills, just good food.  

The pulled pork & brisket is excellent.  The pulled chicken is amazingly tender and moist.  The pork ribs are excellent, and on Wednesdays and Thursdays they have monstrous beef ribs that, while a bit expensive, are killer.  However, the rib tips are probably the best thing on the every-day menu and are the best deal on the menu.  Luscious, fatty meat with an incredible bark.  And each of their sauces is excellent as well, particularly the house carolina red, georgia peach, and mustard sauce.  

The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches and platters are great.  But after you've been a couple of times, you start coming to Black Dog for their amazing daily specials.  

The smoked pork belly on Saturday is just awesome, probably my favorite Black Dog offering.  

$7 bucks will get you 3 tacos for lunch on Tuesday.  Your choice of chicken, pulled pork, or diced brisket + onions & cilantro and their homemade smoked salsa.   A great deal and a very satisfying lunch for a decent price.  But the pastrami on rye that they serve all day is even better.  Thick slabs of seasoned brisket, swiss, and delicious homemade Russian dressing on toasted rye bread that they get a couple blocks away from the local bakery.  Amazing.  

However, Wednesday offers up a Cuban sandwich that is equally great.  Smoked ham, pulled pork, spicy mayo, swiss, and local pickles.  Perfection.  

Other specials include smoked duck on Thursday nights which is tasty but pricey, beef ribs on Wednesday nights, and some fantastic catfish tacos for lunch on Friday.

They also have 7 taps that are dedicated to unique and high quality brews and a nice selection of bottles."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place in town. Their ribs and burnt ends are amazing!!! Definitely go there if you are visiting"}
{"text":"No need for a long wrote out narrative when I can describe this place in in one word.

AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Georgia peach is their default (and imo best)sauce if you're having trouble choosing. Can get super crowded especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town hands down. Georgia Peach is their default (and imo best)sauce if you're having trouble choosing. Newer location sometimes just as crowded as the urbana location though."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to this restaurant. We got there and have a new baby. The man at the door got us in ahead of a few others. We did crammed back in a corner but that was ok, we thought. I was excited when I looked at their menu because they had burnt ends. This is a special extra smoked point of the brisket. They smoke the whole thing 12 hours, trim the point, then dry rub the point and resmoke it 12 hours. This cut was in very limited supply so I wanted to get there early. Luckily we got there in time. I ordered the burnt end sandwich which was topped with vinegar based cole slaw with some purple cabbage in there and their signature vinegar red barbecue    sauce. Smoky, spicy, and tart. As my side I choose the sweet potato fries, which were highly recommended here on yelp. The fries were nice and crisp but seemed like I got the end of a batch because they were all small, short fries. Another great thing about The Black Dog is it has a tremendous beer selection. I had an Avery Maharaja Imperial IPA. Extremely hopped and sitting nice at 10%. The food was great but what have them a 3 star rating was when the air kicked on. Once this happened, dust was flying every where. It was all over my shirt and the table. I am sure I ate some but I could not give up this fine meal. Seems as if a spring cleaning was in order. I would go back to Urbana just to try this again. Next time I hope to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Black Dog has so much good food & good beer. But make sure you have time for the wait. This place is always crowded and there is a line. You go inside and write your name on the list. The wait list does move at a decent pace so you won't be waiting forever. On average, I've waited 20-40 minutes. Meanwhile, you can get a beer from the bar. They have a large selection and used to have flights of beer. Their fresh-squeezed lemonade is so good! There's also a waiting area with a table outside where you can enjoy a beverage. 

You can't go wrong with any of the food on their menu. Everything is delicious - from their entrees (e.g., brisket sandwiches, smoked chicken, smoked catfish; my fave: burnt ends) to their sides (e.g., twice-baked casserole, pit beans; my fave: cornbread embedded with bits of smoked meats and beans) to their bbq sauces (my fave: Milo's Mustard; runner up: Georgia Peach). There are daily specials as well. Even if you picked something at random, it'll be delicious. 

The space is small for the crowd that it tries to accommodate. It can get hot in the summer. There are booths, a few tables, and bar seating. Two tv's are playing in the already loud & cramped dining room. The wait staff seems constantly rushed because so many people come in to eat here. So they'll get you in and out.

Pro: The food is a tasty 5-star
Con: Crowded, they run out of things"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I'll have to come back & try eating in at this new location. I ordered catering online. It was the easiest. The entrance was nondescript & a little difficult to find. Once you get to the of train depot building, go around to the east side. (If by foot or bike, you can even cut over from the police station via the underpass.) The pick-up window is right there & the nice people will even bring your order to your vehicle! I ordered brisket, pulled pork, rib tips, cornbread, twice-baked potatoes, & smoked catfish. Even if you selected from the menu at random you can't go wrong. Everything was delicious. For carry-out, you'll need to provide your own utensils & such but that's no big deal."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and very attentive. I got the combo platter with burnt ends and the brisket with sides of corn bread and the twice cooked caserole. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. I would recommend coming early if you want the burnt ends, they sell out quickly! Try to come before 5pm."}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurants throughout the country, ranging from excellent to poor. I've had great BBQ and mediocre BBQ. However, none of those restaurants deserve the word that I'm going to use to describe Black Dog.

That word, friends, is Flavortown.

Like the lost city of Atlantis, I was skeptical of Flavortown's existence for the longest time. As I was about to abort my lifelong, 22 year quest, I stumbled upon the fabled Flavortown.

The journey was difficult, if you consider a long wait difficult. Luckily we only had to wait a half hour or so, with the hostess constantly telling waiting patrons to \"shut the front door.\" 

After a trying wait, my squadron of 6 was seated. For drinks, one gentleman and I ordered Arnold Palmers, and I would be lying if I said it wasn't the best damn Arnold Palmer I've ever had, and I don't even like Arnold Palmers. The other party members ordered various drinks, as well as chips, salsa, and hummus.

The wait and service were reasonable, and the menu, extensive. I went balls deep and ordered a full slab of ribs with Texas and Lexington sauces, along with fries and applesauce.

The food came, and I discovered the lost city of Flavortown. 

At $27 something, it wasn't a cheap meal (since I bought the chips and salsa and Arnold Palmer) but that's money. I wish the Arnold Palmer came with a free refill, but, once again, that's money, and excellence isn't cheap.

The only con of the meal is I had this looming feeling that Guy Fieri was going to barge in at any second and steal my ribs, but when you're on vacation at Flavortown, you have to endure these thoughts.

10/10"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My wife and I stopped in late on a Saturday afternoon to try it their food. We loved the brisket, the cornbread, the smoked sweet potatoe, and the beer selection. Our only regret is that we had ate breakfast really late and thus were too full to try more food. The smoked sweet potatoe was really good. We tried it because we'd never had a sweet potatoe that'd been smoked before and it was a great decision. The ambiance in late afternoon is casual and laid back. It was a great place to go for a beer, some food, and conversation."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, tasty. Was in town visiting a friend and she suggested we go here- yeah, it was the right choice.  The burnt ends were pretty great and so was most everything else i tried as well."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! Friends recommended we stop here on a road trip. They did not steer us wrong!
I had no idea how good Illinois BBQ could be. The meats, especially the burnt ends, were succulent and smoky. You don't even need the sauce. We also got the mustard sauce and the Carolina red sauce. Both were mouthwateringly good. 
We were also pleased by how great the slaw and side salad were. The greens were organic, local and fresh, and the vinaigrette dressing was delicious. It's not every day you go to a BBQ place with great salad.
Service was perfect. Such a nice waiter."}
{"text":"We were spending the day in Champaign and had heard good things about this place, do we thought we would check it out.  When you arrive, it reminds me of a small town tavern on the outside.  Don't let that deceive you.  
Yes, it is small in the inside, too, but we out our names on the board and were seated within a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar, which was fine.  We were greeted quickly with menus and out in our drink orders.  Local offerings of beer were good and had many others to select from.  I ordered the burnt ends sandwich with sweet potato fries (I forgot to request no coleslaw on the sandwich, so I took it off.  It was mild, however, I am not a coleslaw fan.  My husband got the rib tips with the twice baked potatoes and corn bread.  The food was delicious!  We will definitely be going back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"This might be the best barbecue that I have had in the Midwest. I'm straining my brain to think of better. I spent three years in Texas where I became a real lover of all things barbecue. Black Dog knocked my socks off.

We started with chicken wings. They arrived too hot to touch and glazed in the house standard Carolina BBQ sauce. They were great. Then we shared two combination platters which included brisket, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, twice baked potatoes, slaw, pit beans and sweet potato fries. We had a flight of BBQ sauces which included Carolina, Texas Georgia peach hot and mild, chipotle, Milo's mustard and a vinegar. Get the flight. The diversity of the sauces is half the fun.

Keep in mind that you are in a college town and the atmosphere is busy, bustling and full of college kids. I enjoyed it, and actually prefer it over a faux-texan theme with a bunch of cowboy junk on the walls.

Great beer selection also. I'll be back next time I'm in Urbana."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Black Dog yet!! This place is solid gold and can easily compete in quality (and certainly in price) compared to places around Chicago. In my humble opinion, Black Dog is the crown jewel on the restaurant scene of the Champaign/Urbana area. I hope everyone in the area appreciates what a fantastic place they've got! I'm officially jealous. 

I have only been here twice. Last time I went, I fantasizes about Black Dog for almost a year before finally having the chance to come here again after my brother graduated from U of I. The specialty here is the BBQ, but I'm pleased to report that a vegetarian can eat perfectly fine here! Under the \"not sandwiches\" portion of the menu, there is a portobello mushroom option. It is godly. The almond pesto is seriously the stuff of dreams and the red peppers and goat cheese are he perfect complement. I am in love with the cornmeal crispy warm bun, too. I have TMJ and can therefore usually not bite into big buns, but this one is the absolute perfect size. My dining companions says they especially enjoy the cornbread (which has meat in it), but I'm all about the sweet potato fries for my one side (it comes with one). It's totally worth paying the extra $0.70! 

After writing this review, I now feel sad because no one else I'm close to is a student at UIUC anymore, so I don't have an excuse to drive 2.5 hours to get some Black Dog!"}
{"text":"The fact that I cannot even seem to get into the place at lunch makes me really want to give them less than 5 stars.  At least 75% of the time, I have to go somewhere else because I can't spend my limited allotment of lunch break just standing around drooling.

But the place is undeniable.  Their burnt ends are a revelation.  I could eat the Carolina Red sauce with a spoon.  In a moment of semi-health consciousness, I ordered the applesauce, and even that knocked my socks off... literally.  I spent 35 minutes trying to fish them out from under my table.

I am so tempted to give the place 1 star and tell the rest of you yokels to go eat somewhere else.  For goodness sake, let me have a lunch here every once in a blue moon.  But I cannot do that for it would be a fib.

Instead, I'll just be THAT guy standing over by the door... looking over your shoulder... and trying to use my powers of telepathy to get you to eat and leave sooner so I can sit down."}
{"text":"I always go in there thinking the food is only going to be so so. I would argue that it is not just the best BBQ in Champaign, but some of the best in the state. I am from Chicago so I am not saying this lightly! 

The only slightly annoying thing is that they do not seem to know how to properly stock meats for their popularity. They are constantly running out of meats too quickly! They pretend like they do not know they are popular....they know it. 

Still, the food is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This is one of the only good places to eat in Urbana-champagne. If I am being honest, I don't really \"know\" BBQ or smoked meat...but I know what I like. And this place was good. I had a party of 8, which had to be split, so we had almost everything on the menu. It was all really good. Each of us had a different BBQ sauce. I am not to into really spicy fairs, so I had the Georgia Peach on the meatloaf. It was really good. The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the sweet tea was terrible. It was warm. I know it seems picky, but I was really thirsty!"}
{"text":"Have reviewed Black Dog before, but over two years ago. This place still ranks at the top of my list for good places to eat. The service we received tonight was A++. Couldn't ask for more. Food was spot on.

No surprise that it takes a while to get a table here, since Black Dog is such a good place to dine. Gets kinda noisy, but it is still tolerable.

Overall this casual place is number one in my book."}
{"text":"I started the keto diet so my options are pretty limited for eating out, but this is by far the best cuisine I've had under this diet and I don't feel like I'm limiting myself at all. The beef brisket was 10/10, the cold slaw had a full flavor to it and the slight vinegar taste makes it transcend the category of coleslaw altogether. The bbq sauces are amazing--again there are some vinegar-based sauces that, for someone not able to have traditional sugar-saturated bbq sauce because of keto, were perfect companions to the beef entrees of a classic barbecue restaurant. Also lots of options for beer starting at about $5, including stouts, porters, IPAs and pilsners."}
{"text":"We tried the new Champaign location. It was difficult (for us to find), but we were very happy with the new space when we did. This is a hip, spacious interior, better than we could have envisioned for the expanded second location. The place was so packed (early on a Saturday night) that we sat at the bar for dinner. I had the ribs, and of the meat, I have to say it was good but not great. I reflected long and hard after about why, since so many people rave about Black Dog. 

In the past, I've written about my reservations on Black Dog's sauces. I prefer a thick tomato-based sauce with both savor and sweetness, like Lil Porgy's. None of the sauces at Black Dog compares. The meat at Black Dog is much more consistently smoked. The ribs had that beautiful pink smoke ring that's a hallmark of quality barbecue. So what were these ribs missing? 

Two things. 

First: They are utterly lean. No fat. None. Now, that might appeal to the diet conscious, but I'm not eating bbq pork ribs to watch my waistline. The lack of fat doesn't make the meat tough in this case, because it's been babied through the low and slow smoking process. The meat is tender, but not falling-off-the-bone tender. It's just barely tender to the tooth. It's tight like meat that has a lack of good marbling or rind. Because fat transmits so much flavor, a leaner cut doesn't have as much; in this case, that means the smoke overpowers the meat in taste. 

Second: The ribs have no bark. Bark is the crust that meat can get when it's cooked low and slow. It's crunchy and packed with flavor. These ribs have none of that -- not any caramelization, not any crust, no bark whatsoever. And that's a shame. 

Here's a link to an article about the wonders of bark: http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/bark.html."}
{"text":"I visited this location Sunday night. Ordered   A platter of pulled pork and some sweet potato fries. 

It was the first time I had been here and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. I give it only 4 stars because I did think the meat portions were a bit small for the price. The staff was great and I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is without a doubt, the BEST BBQ IN ILLINOIS. My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. 

Try to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.

They have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!

Now, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.

I know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween. Can't wait to visit my favorite BBQ place in all the land!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that Champaign, Illinois can put out the best barbecue? You lucky UIUC kids, I'm jealous!

Last September, I went to Black Dog for the first time on a double date. We had a 40-minute wait but time flew by in their awesome draft beer selection. They ran out of the famous burnt ends (meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket) by the time we sat down, but everything else was delicious so I promised myself to go back. And I did, 3 times! It has become a tradition for my boyfriend and me. The quality of their food and beer is amazingly consistent.

The burnt ends turned out to be perfectly charred, moist and smokey. On top of that, their hot polish and chicken are just mind blowing. I never pick chicken over beef/pork at bbq places, until I reached my fork into my friend's Black Dog chicken platter :P But tonight, we got another surprise...Smoke Duck Special, which has now made Thursday night the best night! Both the duck and the chicken are worth trying. They not too greasy and deliciously spiced.

Last but not least, I have fallen in love with their sides and bbq sauces. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries and the vinegar based slaw, also, the cornbread has BRISKET in it! I know the bbq sauce variety does not help your decision making. If you like something with a little \"zing\" or \"kick\", I suggest the Hot Georgia Peach and the mustard."}
{"text":"Check out my check in post it says it all.
They need to clean the place and kill the flies...they bite!"}
{"text":"I try to eat here whenever I visit my daughter at U of I. By far the best barbecue in central Illinois and for me it rivals great BBQ joints from Texas. Brisket is excellent along with a spicy BBQ sauce on the side. Good ribs and the smoked catfish is fantastic. I usually get the combo platter of brisket and smoked catfish along with two tasty sides. You can't go wrong with any of the sides, but my favorite is the sweet potato fries. 

Nice beer selection, and if you want to feel like you're hanging out and eating BBQ in Austin, they have Shiner and Lone Star in bottles.

Only catch...the place is so popular and so good (and so small) that wait times can be very long. Come for an afternoon meal on weekends and your wait shouldn't be too bad."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment for my friends 21st birthday. For me personally, the smoke flavor was a little overwhelming, and I would have preferred a classic BBQ sauce instead of the Georgia peach. Overall just an ok meal. However, the service was extraordinary! Jake our server was fantastic, and Chase the greeter was also very attentive. They made my dining experience a lot more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Pretentious.  Over-hyped. Rude. 
The server presents you with your bill by shoving an iPad in your face and showing you that you can select a tip of 18%, 20% or 25% \"or custom amount if you'd like...\" and then stands there staring at you while you decide on their tip.
There is a great letter to the editor in the November 14, 2015, Champaign-Urbana News Gazette that sums it up.  I was not motivated to write a Yelp review until reading that letter which summed up my dining experience just two weeks earlier.
This place would be good if it didn't make me feel so crappy by how little they valued my patronage.  Lose the attitude or lose my business."}
{"text":"The service here was great. The waitress was very helpful and gave good recomenda on the food of what you should get. The burnt ends appetizer is very tender and a good start to the meal. I liked the twice baked potato casserole. The corn bread was ok, and the fries were good. The ribs were good, but there was not a lot of meat. The pulled pork was excellent, and it had a great taste. The chicken was extremely good. It had a great taste, and it was nice and tender. The Georgia peach BBQ was a prefect mild sauce."}
{"text":"Always ridiculously good BBQ and the quality stayed strong with their new location"}
{"text":"Just like the Urbana location, the food at this location is on point. Since the restaurant is even bigger, wait time goes quicker. 

The food comes to the table quickly and cooked to perfection. The wait staff truly seemed to be working as a team, as we had a few different waiters come to our table to make sure our drinks were filled throughout the night. 

The downside to black dog is that... 

1. You can't make reservations

2. It is near impossible to bring a big party here unless you're willing to wait an eternity
I came on a Sunday night and only had to wait about 10 minutes, but the party of 9 in front of us had already been waiting an hour and weren't seated until later. Another large party in front of us had also been waiting around an hour and eventually just decided to leave.

3. They often run out of things...  
By 7 or 8:00 a waitress ran us through a long list of things that we could no longer order. After we placed our orders, we heard the kitchen yelling to \"86 x y z of the menu\", meaning more things were now on the \"you can't order\" list. 

ANYWAY, I totally recommend coming to this place if you're looking for the best BBQ in town. Just stick to small groups and come at weird times to avoid the wait. ;) Also, try the flight of sauces for $2! It's a lot of fun to get the variety."}
{"text":"Black Dog is the best BBQ you can get in Champaign, that is, if you can actually get it. They restock most of their meats twice a day, but if you're not there soon afterwards your options will be limited. The burnt ends in particular are almost always sold out. Try to avoid going on the weekends, during big sports events, or days when lots of people come to visit the UIUC campus.

When you do get your food, though, it's pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely well above average. The burnt ends are fantastically tender and well-seasoned, and the BBQ pork and brisket are tasty too. Their sauce selection is varied, but they lack a traditional, spicy sauce. All the ones I've tried have been merely okay, nothing worth writing home over. But, on the whole, if you go when there's meat to be had you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love finding a new restaurant to try. Wait was not terrible, but there was one.  Food was great service was good.  We are not a family  who likes to linger, so the fast pace was perfect.  Calling themselves an ale house is a bit misleading since most beers are bottled.  Will definitely dine 
here again when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ!!! Pineapple margarita was delicious! Burnt ends were so smoky!  The homemade ranch dressing was great too! My son said the chicken sandwich was the best thing he'd eaten in months."}
{"text":"Might be the best barbecue I've ever had. Burnt ends were amazing. Pulled pork was so so. Hot Georgia peach sauce was amazing but definitely hot. Sweet potato fries are an amazing option for the wife. You don't see that often in a BBQ joint. It's location looks really cool outside. Our waitress was amazing and tentative. 

 Wife and I made a mistake and tried to share food. Too good to share. Go all in and get a 3 meat. It's worth it.


They stuck us next to the food window and under a drip that she kept wiping up. Expensive, even sharing a meal and the little girls sharing a grilled cheese. Macaroni was dry but the double baked potato casserole was pretty good."}
{"text":"Get the burnt ends and smoked wings appetizer if that's all you eat at this place! this place is amazing...and I'm from the south and went to school in NC!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ around! The food is incredible! Everyone knows this, though, so be prepared for a long wait for a table if you aren't ordering to go. Get there early before the burnt ends are sold out. It is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, 5 stars. The beef brisket was fantastic (even better that you could order a lean cut), but the burnt ends is where it's at! Crispy on the outside, still juicy on the inside...I don't know how they do it, but they better not stop any time soon. 

How about the BBQ sauce you might ask? Fantastic! A little bit spicy, just the way I like it. And don't forget the sides! I don't think you could go wrong with any of them.

Now on to the beer. Oh the beer! They rotate selections, and you know they're good when you have 3 of the 8 choices and each one is better than the last. Especially nice that you could take it outside while you're waiting.

This is definitely my first stop for whenever I come to town from now on. A-mazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here while on our way traveling across country. This place isn't very big so prepare to wait to be seated. The atmosphere is loud and fun like a college town bar/grill should be. The food is a unique twist on your typical bbq and was good but not the best. We got cornbread as an appetizer and it was good (unique) but not that amazing. I got sweet iced tea to drink and it wasn't that good. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of loaded mashed potatoes. It was good but still nothing amazing. My husband got a meat platter which he said was good and the sweet potato fries were delicious! Glad we tried it out but probably won't be back if we come back this way."}
{"text":"Gud grub, excellent corn bread. In fact, it's the best I've ever had. I ordered the 3-meat combo platter. I chose 1/4 slab ribs, brisket, & pulled pork, cuz they were out of Burnt Ends :(  Also, u hav a choice of 5 sauces, I went with the fruity/cue-y Georgia Peach sauce. I also had a Nitro brew which was great cuz they don't leave you with the fullness of a regular beer. -1* for the gas taste of the pulled pork. Will definitely b bak!"}
{"text":"Plenty of positive detailed reviews here already.  First timer. Stopped by on way back from Danville Il for dinner Fri around 5:45p.  Seemed like a good time to get a table.  Last  time we tried the wait at Lunch was ridiculous.  The ribs were outstanding and tons of interesting sauces to choose from.  Recommend the flight of sauces for $2.  Enough for the whole table.  The corn bread is simply the best I have ever had.  So dense.  Yum.  Oh and the Bloody Mary made with tequila and the Pineapple margarita were awesome.  Wish this place was closer!"}
{"text":"Driving through central Illinois--let's be honest--there's not much to be wowed by, unless you're really, really into corn and soybean fields.  Next to a diploma from U of I, there is only one reason to pull into Chambana: Black Dog burnt ends.  I can't even begin to describe how incredible these slices of meat are, because tender, juicy, salty, prime, smokey, flavorful are just the tip of the iceberg.  This is the kind of BBQ that makes you swear out loud even if there are children sitting within earshot.  You simply cannot control yourself in between bites, nor do you feel ashamed of your mouth and fingers being covered in premier pieces of saucy, smoked meat.  Eating here is a bittersweet experience, for although your life changes for the better--knowing how BBQ should taste--you also grimace with the thought of how agonizing future meals will be, as they won't compare to a glistening platter of meat at Black Dog.  Still, don't let that stop you from the joy and meat sweats that the best BBQ in Central Illinois--or dare I say the Midwest--has to offer."}
{"text":"If you're planning to dine at Black Dog, come early at lunchtime so you can get some of those burnt ends or smoked turkey.  Both times I've come through I've just missed them.  Still, there's always plenty of brisket and ribs to eat to my heart's content, and the meats will BLOW. YOUR. MIND.

If you're passing through Chambana, this is the best meal you're going to get for miles.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Good food. Not the cheapest for the amount of food they serve. I've had better and faster service at a local restaurant and most chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about how good the food is here.  Tried the smoked polish for a change and DAMN!  perfection; had no idea a sausage could be so tasty.

The quality and variety on the ever-changing beer sampler flight holds me in thrall to the awesomeness that is Black Dog.  They continue to seem busier every time we return.  Still run out of stuff- once again scored one of the last burnt ends portions.

And, yes, I actually eat here way more often than I yelp it.  I know, right?  If I could only eat one place in Urbanabannana for the rest of my time here- it'd probly be here.

A tiny blond sorority type was asking about vegetarian options.  Umm, sorry sweetie, have your boyfriend run you up-street to Courier.  The waitress was all \"well, our fries are vegetarian, and we could fix you a grilled cheese.\"  Mwahahaha."}
{"text":"It's really güd but it's really pricey and the portion is pretty small. I still recommend this place tho. The food is never disappointing."}
{"text":"We drove an hour and a half to eat here one last time before moving out east.  This place keeps getting busier. Good, he should expand!  Minus one star for always running out of food.  I know, it's typical of smokehouses, but still...  I always request to get the Georgia Peach bbq sauce, I could seriously drink that stuff.  No other smokehouse I've been to has ever had a sauce I find even remotely as delicious.  I also love the cornbread.  To drink, I get the jalapeno pineapple margarita, it's a very good combination of flavors.  I love that they serve the food on metal trays too."}
{"text":"The largest problem that I have with Yelp reviews of restaurants is that it doesn't have separate categories for reviews of service, decor, atmosphere and the food itself (which is why one usually reads reviews for, ironically). In order to facilitate easy understanding of my opinions, please note that the Rating is in relation to the quality of the food itself while the other categories will be rated below. 

Service: 3.5 - depending on the crowd one can either get their food fairly quickly or 40 minutes later; I am a huge fan of the BBQ here but a couple of weeks ago, with a large crowd, I had to wait at least 40 mins for my Catifsh sandwich. 

Decor: 3 - nothing to write home about but they do have 2 large flatscreens always showing sports so its nice to sit at the bar with a good beer and food in order to enhance one's viewing experience. 

Food: 5 - It is hands down, the best BBQ in the area. The quality per price ratio is also top notch since the larger helpings will usually tide people over for leftovers as well as fill those who are ravenous. 

The beer here is really good and reflective of the overall abundance of good microbrews and international beers available in the Champaign-Urbana area. 

My favorites here are the burnt ends, beef brisket, ribs, catfish, pit beans and the mac cheese special side on Thursdays."}
{"text":"The burnt ends were absolutely amazing! We may make future trips to Urbana to come back (with visits to our daughter as a bonus)."}
{"text":"You've gotta come check out Black Dog! They're usually packed, so be sure to come in early! This is definitely one of the better BBQ I've had. The corn bread here is ridiculously good. Be sure to try some of that. Just be careful as it's addicting! I've always found myself buying extra so I can bring it home!

Anyways, I always get a sampler of everything there. The brisket and ribs are definitely my favorites there. You can't go wrong with that.

They also have some amazing service. From the moment I walked in, there was a guy (forgot his name) that was very inviting and with a great sense of humor. Wish I can go back, but I'm back in LA!"}
{"text":"If you like really dry, overcooked ribs and tips, come to this place. We came with a big group and it was already packed, so we decided to do carryout. It turned out to be 30 mins of waiting in a small cramped restaurant, with people constantly walking by forcing you to move, when our food finally came. There was also a guy walking out telling me, \"not worth the wait.\" I didn't think too much of it because the place looked promising. We went back to eat it and took about 10 mins figuring out who ordered what. They place all of our food together in 3 bags, which was fine, but they didn't labeled anything. We ordered the combo which included pulled pork, slab of ribs, and rib tips. I only tried the ribs and tips, but they were really dry and the sauce didn't make it any better. I have tried many great ribs, but this one definitely don't cut it. As busy as it gets here, the guy was right, definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The freshest barbecue in the entire city in the freshest barbecue I've ever eaten the place is busy so sometimes you can get in and out quickly there's only one complaint and it's completely understandable they will not see your party until everyone in your party is there because they fill up quickly and they just don't have time to wait"}
{"text":"Best BBQ on Earth. Not just saying that, I've had BBQ all over the world and this is still hands down the best."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq food that is essentially the same as the newer Champaign location. The burnt ends and unique cornbread are their most noteworthy dishes. Incredible side options as well where you really can't go wrong. The only downfall is the difficulty getting a table (everyone knows about this place and always wants to come, and rightfully so)."}
{"text":"This place is a bbq lover's utopia. There's a reason Maxim rated Black Dog the #2 best bbq joint in the U.S. back in 2013 (at that time, it was just the Urbana location). A big one being their burnt ends. 

I've tried just about everything here at this point and after numerous visits, my usual order is the burnt ends platter with succotash and twice baked potato casserole. Although to be honest, you cannot go wrong with any of the other sides as well since they're all incredible (well, maybe not so much the mac&cheese). But I always make sure to get the cornbread appetizer (2 muffins) because their cornbread is the most unique and juicy cornbread you will ever try. Did I mention the burnt ends? 

I recently returned and tried their brisket chili for the first time (evidently one of the cook's family recipe) and it is some of the best chili I've ever had. They also have craft beer on tap and games on. Burnt ends."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, the service is always amazing. You order and literally get your food within minutes. Service is super fast. My favorite place to eat in town by far"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! The pork spareribs are amazing! I personally love the Georgia Peach bbq sauce. Very sweet and delicious! I have not tried other bbq sauces because I am not a fan of spicy/hot. The sides that I got: mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. Their sweet potato fries are fire. Pretty hard to mess up. Would recommend these two sides. 

The wait can be a bummer. This restaurant is usually very busy! If you plan on going, make sure you expect the wait. There hasn't been a time where I went and did not have to wait lol. 

But the service is on point. Very friendly and quick. Would love to see this restaurant expand. They do have 2 locations I believe. 

I also got their sweet iced tea. Personally it was not that sweet. Not something I would recommend to someone to get. But the food overrides this negative. And they refilled my cup every time I drank about half of it. Lol almost as if they did not want me to stop drinking it."}
{"text":"Very fine Establishment and hands down the best BBQ in Champaign. I've been here several times and it has only let me down once. Typically get the Pulled Pork along with the sweet potato fries. The Burnt Ends are something to experience as an appetizer. For the quality of the food, the price is reasonable. Sometimes the wait can be rather long but for good reason."}
{"text":"One of the best places for BBQ, at either location. I eat here at least twice- five times a month.....no that is not an exaggeration. I love this place. Great food, great staff, and always some sort of sports on tv. Perfect date night spot for a couple or even a double date."}
{"text":"Was in town on business and found this on Yelp. A customer suggested we go there saying it was the best barbecue in Illinois. Got there early for lunch and ordered the burnt ends, unbelievably delicious. Parking was plentiful, the server was knowledgeable and friendly. The atmosphere was open and fun. A lively place well worth the trip. Next time through Champaign I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Small place. We went on a Tuesday and waited only 5 minutes. There were four of us and we split two combo dishes. Everything we had was amazing. Chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket, and sausage. 5 stars from everyone."}
{"text":"I can't lie, I was pretty excited to try this place after all of the high reviews, but BD was a little overrated.  And for the record... the lines are real.  I went on a Wednesday around 6pm and still had to wait a good 15 mins or so.

The good: The sauces were delicious.  I had the Carolina Red and Hot Georgia Peach - both were excellent with just the right amount of heat (I like it hot).  French fries were really good - not overcooked or cold.  Overall the meat that I selected was tasty.  I had the pulled pork and burnt ends which were both cooked to my liking.  And the Metropolitan Ironworks beer was pretty good.

The bad: The coleslaw was barely edible.  The cabbage was almost completely raw and the sauce was a huge miss.  I don't think it was just me either.  I noticed a few other people who's plates were clean except for the slaw.  The biggest disappointment of my whole visit though were the burnt ends which were almost half fat.  The whole point of a BBQ spot is the meat, so you've got to do this right!  I was expecting a better job on the trimmings considering the prices.  Lastly, the Green Flash beer was underwhelming.  They claim that it's like Bud Light, except that it's not and cost $6.  Make sure you ask for a taste before ordering.

Overall it was a decent spot and I Ill will probably try again now that I know what items to avoid."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, first come first serve hosting works! They are fast."}
{"text":"Good value and atmosphere, wish the booths were higher backed and more private, but otherwise the food and experience exceptional.  Great staff running of the front of the house too.  Casual but classy."}
{"text":"I'm a Texan just in the area passing through, so I'm a tough critic. That said...their meat was deeelish! I had the (lean) brisket and polish sausage. The brisket was very tender and I'm not used to polish sausage, but I especially liked it with the mustard sauce. We ordered the sauce sampler so we could try them all and I'm glad we did. The mustard was good with the pork and the sausage. Again, being Texan I liked the hotter ones. (Hot Georgia peach, Caroline Red, and Chipotle BBQ. I don't care for vinegar sauces, so be warned their default sauce is Lexington Dip and it's a vinegar one. 
We had the smoked cornbread as an appetizer and it was great! It's a unique flavor and texture for cornbread, but if you like things smoked I would try it!
Only thing I didn't love were the sides. I had the vinegar slaw and potato salad. The family had the pit beans, chipotle slaw and sweet potato fries, they liked theirs...above average fries/beans. Just so/so for mine. The potato salad definitely needed a kick. I put the milo mustard on it and that helped. 
We were sad they were out of burnt ends! I would go back to have burnt ends and try different sides. Fun place, friendly service and very busy! Our family has always had black labs so we got a good looking baseball Tee souvenir of the \"black dog.\""}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ I've ever had. I go here every time I visit U of I. Ribs, catfish, salmon, wings are all amazing.The mashed potatoes are perfect. That is all. Eat here! (but go early - there is usually a wait)"}
{"text":"Just as good as the original with more room. Orderly computerized wait list beats the old handwritten system at the Urbana location. Major plus: when you wanna drink afterwards, you can go to dt champaign bars instead of dt Urbana which is usually dead."}
{"text":"THE.BEST.BBQ.EVER. Carolina red, pulled chicken, ribs, twice baked potato casserole, pit beans. Perfection."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had. The menu has great choices with daily specials added. Everything is delicious, they have a nice beer selection, the staff is friendly, and both locations are pleasant and appealing."}
{"text":"Love this place (especially their chili).  I order from Black Dog to cater parties at my house.  Very happy that C-U has a quality BBQ place like this."}
{"text":"Passing by on the interstate and saw the positive reviews. Love BBQ, so decided to check it out. Absolutely amazing beef brisket! The mustard sauce added an unusual and enhancing punch! Service was impeccable -- quick, joyful (even). Will definitely stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bbq places. The burnt ends are always tender and on point. The prices are also pretty good for what you get and I always end up taking at least one side home. I usually order the combo platter which has 2 sides and either 2 or 3 meats of your choosing. It comes out to around $20 if you get a drink and the pick two combo. The servers are always nice and friendly as well.

You may have to go early depending on what you want. They'll tend to run out of burnt ends depending on the day and time."}
{"text":"OMG! Is definitely in order!!!!
To start the beer selection is awesome!
Got a combo plate. The brisket was awesome, the pulled pork is fantastic and the burnt ends are so orgasmic!
The fries are good and loved the slaw!
Even better yet, for $2 you can get a fleet of sauces so a person can taste it all. 
It was so good I haven't made my mind up as I will go back again and again and again!!!!!"}
{"text":"The new Black Dog location is excellent. They have convenient carry-out and plenty of seating. This is some of the highest quality BBQ food that I have ever tried. The sandwiches, sides, and platters are all quite filling and a good bang for your buck!

They have superior service and excellent drinks as well. My personal favorite is the burnt ends, which is quite limited in supply so get there early to try it. Every day there is a different special that is excellent. One of my favorite restaurants in the area, a must-try!"}
{"text":"First time here, and has already won the title of my favorite barbecue place. They have a variety of meats, so if you are a die-hard carnivore this place is for you!!!! Pulled pork, chicken, beef ribs, salmon, and AMAZING sides like Mac and cheese, fries, cornbread, it's a great, laid-back environment, especially for a boys night out or a group hang out. They are known for their burnt ends (literally ran out within an hour of opening so didn't get to try it) but instead ordered their ribs which was cooked to precision. I am a huge critic on meat, and this place deserves 5/5 stars. Love and definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Champaign!"}
{"text":"I had a full rack of ribs with slaw and sweet potato fries as my sides. The ribs were some of the best dry rub ribs I've had: very tender, smokey and meaty. I could not finish a full rack. The fries were on par with any other sweet potato fries I've had anywhere, but the portion size was relatively small and the fries themselves were on the cool side like they'd been cooked and reheated. The slaw was not to my liking. The cabbage was cut too thick, chewy and bitter.  And while the sauce was a pretty tasty vinegar base, it did nothing to transform the cabbage. The sauce just ran to the bottom of the bowl. I would definitely recommend this place if just for the ribs. Our party of 4 waited about an hour to get in, but the servers were attentive and good at handling large crowds.  I would have given Black Dog 5 stars if the slaw and fries were better.  Overall, I love the feel of the place and appreciate a small business that does things well."}
{"text":"The burnt ends get all the rave but if you haven't tried the chicken quarters or the salmon then you're missing out on the real gems black dog has to offer.  More flavorful than any other meats.  Pair anything with the milos spicy mustard and you'll have a treat worth savoring. Try the daily special items like the Mac n cheese.  Never to be regretted.  Not to mention the cornbread loaded with brisket. No one leaves black dog disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't let the long line turn you off; it is totally worth the wait. Delicious BBQ, great beer selection, excellent service, and a fun, lively atmosphere. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"When I am in town, I usually get Lil' Porgy's. My brother wanted me to expand my horizons so he picked up some Black Dog for me since he really likes it. I ordered a chicken sandwich. I give them a thumbs up in regards to their quality of meat. Very nice. However, they fail on their sauces. I tried a couple and they were both bad. I would have preferred to have used some store bought BBQ sauce instead. So my rating is solely cause of the meat. I don't think I would order again since sauce is such an important part of BBQ."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas & my friend's & I wanted to try out some BBQ while we were out here in Illinois. The pork ribs were well cooked. The burnt ends were cooked so well that it literally crumbled. Loved it. Potato salad was standard. Corn bread was a little different in what it was made from but okay. All came out to around $15. Definitely a place to try if you want some good Texas smoked BBQ!"}
{"text":"Some excellent BBQ, cheap and savory. The atmosphere is awesome and the food is great. Open late so you can get that late night snack. Lost the star on account of the attitude of our waiter. It wasn't a horrible experience he was friendly enough but just that it felt forced. The campus is near by so it could be on account of having to deal with college kids often. No love lost."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my ribs, but Black Dog does it for me!  We usually order take out so we can relax and savor every bite.  We'll be dining in soon at their new location."}
{"text":"I've been to the Champaign location 5 times. Twice at the beginning the food was good but in the last two months The food is always dry. I'm guessing the two chefs have very different food management systems. I bought a rib tip take out last night and they were dry. Let's get it together BD and make the food more appealing. I'll just cook it myself until you guys figure it out. 
We need you all to fix this so we can support you!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana! Waitstaff is so courteous and friendly! I'm there with my roommate every Thursday evening because of the special side of mac and cheese, its seriously the best mac and cheese ever! Pulled Pork Sandwich is amazing as well as the Cuban Sandwich! You have to try the Smoked Artichoke dip on Tuesday evenings as well. You have to wait sometimes about an hour to be seated but its so worth it!"}
{"text":"Black Dog is a must every time I visit campus because it's too amazing to miss out on. I always get the combo platter because triple is too much food for me even though everyone will agree that you can never have enough of Black Dog. I always get fries and potato casserole for the sides. For the meat I would get the ribs and smoked chicken. I got the triple platter before and had to save some for lunch the next day. It tasted just as good as it did the night before when it was fresh. 

Fries and potato casserole: Their fries are just as amazing as Joes fries. It's crispy and crunchy. The way you bite into it and taste the crispiness then potato melts in your mouth is just delicious. OH MY GOD, their potato casserole is always so fresh and never a disappointment. I would always eat it last and it would still be steamy hot as I break into it. I love my potatoes and I've to say they have the best potato casserole in the whole entire universe.

Pork ribs and smoked chicken: I usually get pork ribs or rib tips and smoked chicken. I always get the chicken because not a lot restaurants can smoke it the way in which the breast is still juicy and tasty. I always prefer dark meat when I eat chicken, but at Black Dog I always hope for the breast and wing because of the juicy breast. It goes perfect with any sauce you choose or even ketchup! I love ketchup so sometimes I would dip my chicken breast into ketchup. Ribs are ribs and you can never mess them up. They're always just so good at controlling the quality of their food. The food here is super affordable and it fills you up. 

I've had their brunt ends before and it was too fatty for me. If you think you can handle the fattyness then I highly recommend it because it just melts in your mouth when you try to bite into it. Make sure you get there when they open for lunch or dinner to catch the burnt ends because they go super quick. Their salmon is pretty good as well. I tried everything on the platter menu and they were all excellent. You can't go wrong with anything you order at Black Dog. 

SUPER HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves bbq because this is the place you HAVE TO GO TO. I have yet been to a bbq place that's better than Black Dog. I tried Smoque in Chicago and it was nothing compared to Black Dog."}
{"text":"Might as well toss my review on the pile of others, I guess.  I had actually been avoiding Black Dog because of all the hype it's gotten on yelp, sorry to say.  That was a definite mistake and I wish I had gone here sooner!  

Everything I've tried here has been excellent.  Even the sweet potato fries, which I usually don't like, were awesome.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The prices are pretty darn amazing ($6 for a sandwich and side?  Awesome).  And they have fresh squeezed lemonade, free refills.  My first time here was with my mom and stepdad, and they loved it.  My stepdad hates pretty much every restaurant we go to, and his most frequently said phrase after dinner is \"4/10.\"  Black Dog got an \"Eh, I'd come back here,\" which is a ringing endorsement from him.

In addition they have a nice selection of beers on draft at all times.  The first time I went here, my boyfriend got the sampler and it had 4 pale ales, which I was a little disappointed in (though they were pretty good).  However, they rotate in 6 new beers every week or so (I'm guessing) so it's worth coming back frequently.  I was there just the other day and got a Left Hand Milk Stout, which happens to be one of my favorites.  So smooth, so good."}
{"text":"I still remember when I tried this place for the first time as a freshman.  Let me just say that it is still a coveted experience as a Master's student because it is so dang good! The wait at the Urbana location can get pretty long, but every time I've come to the spot in Champaign, even with a group of 6, we could get seated pretty quickly. And thank the lord for the electronic ordering system, it makes payment so much faster!

The Champaign location is much larger than the Urbana one. I have sat at the bar and on the floor, and the service is the same in both locations. The servers are always friendly and happy to answer any of my questions! 

For food, I like to split a platter with three different meats with a friend and sample different sauces. We're usually stuffed by the end because you also get sides and I have yet to be disappointed. Everybody raves about the burnt ends, and while they were very tasty, they also had a lot of fat and I wasn't the biggest fan... The Blackdog burger (I switched out the sweet Georgia Peach sauce with a mild Milo's Mustard Sauce) was delicious! For sides, you can't go wrong with some classic mac and cheese and fries (sweet potato and regular are both great). But since this is a BBQ joint, their cornbread is pretty out of this world.

This should be on everyone's list of places to try in the Champaign-Urbana area!"}
{"text":"I was visiting this area and my friend recommended this local favorite restaurant to me. So I tried! And it was very good. The place is near the Illinois terminal and the building design is very cool. The food was great! I had the impossible burger (which is vegan, made from plants), and I liked it so much. My friend had the meat and fish combo. The peach beer was very good!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Used to always go there with friends for their beef ribs, they recently changed something about the beef ribs and now they taste horrible! cutting corners perhaps?"}
{"text":"The barbecue here has always been decent with the cornbread muffins being the exception- they are AMAZING. They have pulled pork in them and omg so tasty.

But the last time I went I tried the vegan impossible burger... wow. One of the best vegetarian/vegan burgers I have EVER HAD! It was so smoky and tasty that I checked the burger about 6 different times to make sure it was plant based. The only reason you can tell it's plant based is it doesn't have any fattiness to it, but somehow it still tastes extremely meaty!!!

Definitely recommend this place if you're a non-meat eater with meat eater friends or relatives. They also label all of the sides and other food options as vegetarian or vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and the Black Dog was suggested by some of the locals. I ended up going two nights in a row. The first night I had the hot Polish sausage and the catfish. I'm not normally much of a fish eater, but it was so good I ended up having the catfish the second night as well, along with the brisket. The meats were perfectly cooked and so smoky and juicy that you really didn't need the sauces for either the flavor or moisture, although their sauces could have a review of their own. 

For the sides, I tried the smoked sweet potato, the cornbread, and the pit baked beans.  I'm always looking for baked beans with great flavor and most of the time I'm disappointed with sweet flavored beans that taste like they've come from the store. Black Dog's beans are the best I've had anywhere and I would go back just for the beans alone.   The smoky cornbread was exceptional, and the smoked sweet potato with just a touch of butter and brown sugar was amazing. 

Whenever I visit the Champaign-Urbana area (and by area I mean anywhere within a hundred miles!), the Black Dog will be my first stop for dinner."}
{"text":"The new location is really nice.  I love that they transformed the old depot into an awesome place to eat.  It was worth the wait.  The food is totally the same.  DELICIOUS!  I was there for the soft opening last night and saw familiar faces from the Urbana location and also some awesome servers that I am familiar with from other spots around town.  They seem to have it under control.  We  were seated quickly and got food fast.  
My favorite is the smoked salmon on salad greens.  Try it!  You will love it.
P.S.
Michael Heldebrandt is a pretty pretty princess."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charleston Illinois and since there isn't many decent places to eat there me and my boyfriend decided to take a ride to Champaign for some BBQ. Boy, were we happy with that decision!  Great little bbq place. I had a cheeseburger with fries and it was quite delicious. For an appetizer I had chips with salsa and although that isn't a hard dish to make the chips tasted like they had just baked them! Love!"}
{"text":"The cornbread is amazing fresh out of the oven, and the burnt ends are as everyone says -"}
{"text":"Get the burnt ends, get here 30min before they open. Get a pineapple pepper margarita. Get the twice baked potato casserole. You will love it. You are welcome."}
{"text":"I was coming for their BBQ grill cheese and they surprised me with some smoked jackfruit. Really good. I got it with the extra hot sauce which is really spicy and has good flavor. Goose Island root beer is also a must have."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and I'm just visiting so I heard that this was kind of a big deal place to go to. So I tried it out with some friend! Omg I was in heaven!! It was soooo good! Definitely must try!"}
{"text":"Great food. It's indicative by the long lines at lunch and dinner time. Which I would say is the only downfall to the place. It's small, but the kitchen moves pretty fast for it's size. The food is delicious, I've tried something new every time I've gone and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"My review is based more on the entire experience rather than the food itself. Came by on a Saturday night with a party of six and we had to wait about an hour and a half before we got seated. By the time we did get seated they had run out of: brisket, burnt tips, smoked catfish, smoked chex mix and their potato casserole which included a couple things that I had wanted to try. 

I ended up going with the two meat platter and got bacon meat loaf and fried cat fish while one of my friends got pulled pork and ribs. The ribs and meat loaf were pretty good, but the pulled pork was a little dry and the fried cat fish was just average as well. I would say all the sides are pretty delicious and I had a try at the cornbread, potato salad, slaw, and beans. The corn bread is outstanding with bits of meat in it and the potato salad was pretty good as well. You get to choose hot sauces to go with your meal and I would definitely recommend the Georgia peach! I will have to try this place again to see how the brisket, burnt tips, and smoked cat fish are!"}
{"text":"People who work there are friendly and know what they are doing. I honestly could not understand all the hype behind black dog. I got a burger and it was not good."}
{"text":"Honestly, all I need to say is burnt ends.

It's not something I've seen at other bbq places but they really should do it. Seriously, I want to just go in with $50 and be like, \"Load me up on the burnt tips.\"

Besides that, I had brisket which was good. I feel like a lot of the smoked brisket I've had before tends to be very tender, but to the point where it's just like shreddy beef sinews. I appreciated that, though this brisket was tender, it had some structural integrity. Twice baked potato casserole was killer and the sweet tea was cloyingly sweet (which is the only way to make sweet tea). I also had slaw, which I didn't love and the sauce was pretty vinegary. 

But those burnt ends. It was enough to make me look past the little things.

I'll be back. You bet I will. And I'll be back for burnt ends (but other good stuff too.)"}
{"text":"I don't eat meat or fish. But I like drinking and eating with friends. I've had Black Dog's Portabella Mushroom sandwich and thought it was OK. I was really looking for a some kind of combo dish where I could choose a few vegetarian sides (some hot, some cold) plus corn bread, all served on one plate. Ex. fried greens, TX Caviar (white bean salad), slaw and sweet potato fries. The next time I went with folks who eat there often. They suggested I get the Texas Caviar salad. There is no fish involved in this salad. It is actually a darn good white bean salad on a bed of lettuce with cheese. We ordered the Texas Caviar appetizer, which is the white bean salad with warm n' salty, out-of-the-fryer corn chips that where were TO DIE FOR! I also had an OK beer and a pretty good, perhaps too sweet Pineapple Pepper Margaritas. But I am still holding out for the vegetarian combo dish! P.S. The bike parking here is perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I headed to the Black Dog on a recommendation from a friend while in Urbana for a college football game. We were not disappointed! The place is in a quaint little brick building in what I assume is considered downtown Urbana. Seating is very limited and they don't take reservations. Luckily there were two seats at the bar. 

The folks behind the bar and the serving staff were super friendly and attentive, without being over the top. The menu is solid but not overly crowded with too many options. They offer appetizers, salads sandwiches and of course, great barbecue. The beer selection is good and there seems to be something for everyone. The prices seemed reasonable to me with nothing standing out as over priced. 

My wife ordered the pulled pork with a side of twice baked potatoes. I ordered a smoked Turkey sandwich with chipotle coleslaw as my side. The food was delivered to us in less than 5 minutes and was outstanding, and the portions were large. So large in fact that I barely finished my sandwich and could not finish my slaw. 

Both of us left the restaurant very full and satisfied. We both agreed that we'll be back the next time we come to town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  I'm from Buffalo NY and we know all about great food. Do not miss this place! Affordable, delicious and awesome staff! Draught beer selection is so good! Bel's amber and Hawaiian shirt are not to be missed."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am very set in my ways when it comes to BBQ. I've grown up close to Memphis, Texas, StL, and KC. BBQ had been a large part of my eating for as long as I can remember. Because of that, I was looking for a go-to BBQ spot for my relocation to UIUC for grad school. This was my first attempt because of the reviews. 

I wanted to try everything we could, so I got a combo plate (brisket, ribs, pulled pork).  To really get a good idea, I ordered a sauce flight to go with it. That's where things got ugly. 

Of the 8 sauces offered, 5 of them were something I would never eat again in a million years. 2 of them were not terrible, but I'd even prefer a package of BBQ sauce from Burger King or McDonald's.  One of them--can't remember now if it was the Texas one or the spicier version of the Georgia peach--was ok. 

I'm sorry, but that doesn't cut it. The meat was cooked well, and the sides were good. However, when the sauce is a letdown, the whole meal is a letdown. I had high hopes, and this place disappointed me. I will continue to look for an option in C-U that reminds me of any of the great places back home(s)."}
{"text":"Their meats are such a treat, you could really taste the craftsmanship in them. My co-worker raved about this place, especially their burnt ends. So I stopped by in the afternoon and ordered carry out, it was ready for me within 20 minutes. I order the appetizer portion of their burnt ends w/ the Carolina Red sauce, and their smoked wings w/ the Lexington sauce. Both sauces were ranked medium to medium hot on their scale. 

Everything was so delicious. For ~$6, my order came with 6 wings/drums, what a deal! The meats were juicy and tender and had so much smoke incorporated into them. It just fell off the bone with the slightest tug. The Carolina Red sauce went well with it, it had a slight heat and the acidity from the vinegar played well with the smoke and fat. The burnt ends were equally as delicious, a decent sized slab. It was also very much smoke infused. With all the fat rendered out, it still had moisture and just crumbled in my mouth. I didn't like the Lexington sauce I picked with it, that's on me though, a hot BBQ would have been a better companion in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm a huge barbecue fan. Any time there's rumor of a good place in the area, I'm there. Since finding out about Black Dog I seriously don't eat anywhere else when I want barbecue. This place is so unbelievable. It's the only restaurant that I've been to that every single time I go I will order two platters of whatever menu choice that I make that evening. Not because the first one isn't filling enough, but because it's so dang good that you can't help but throw your money at these people. The only way barbecue gets better than this, is if it's made by the hands of our Savior Jesus himself."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ out there.  Like everyone else says, be prepared to wait.  It is definitely worth the wait, and the prices are extremely acceptable for the great tasting food."}
{"text":"Seated in the heart of downtown Urbana, this restaurant gives the BBQ lover and anyone who loves a laid back, eclectic environment essentially nirvana. The help is great, and while you may wait a bit because it's generally busy (We went at 3:00 on Saturday and had a 10 minute wait), it's well worth it. Their menu is extensive and their selection of spirits was something that was pleasantly surprising. We all had different things and everyone was happy with their choices, and if you are a BBQ enthusiast, the house BBQ is definitely different, with a tangy vinegary taste with a nice smoky kick to it. 

If you haven't been there and have the opportunity, run, don't walk!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try when you're in Champaign-Urbana! Love all the sauces, especially the hot Georgia Peach. You must try the burnt ends! My go to sides are the baked beans and potato salad."}
{"text":"This place is perfect except for the long lines and running out of the smoked meats later in the evening. I would recommend going during lunchtime or right at 5pm if you don't want to wait.
The bbq is amazing, I usually have the pulled pork but their beef is great as well. Sweet potato fries are excellent, and their pit beans are really delicious too. Their sauce actually isn't all that great, too much vinegar and not enough spice, but the taste of the meat is so perfect that it doesn't matter. I'd recommend having the sauce on the side.
Beer selection is good and they always have a few great choices on tap. Best bbq place (if not the best restaurant period) in Champaign-Urbana, hands down."}
{"text":"...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it.  I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination.    If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Burt tips like filet mignon ...... Spicy potato salad, the best I've ever had.....the fastest service I've ever had....almost too fast...nice beer selection....nice atmosphere in an old train station depot....love the experience..."}
{"text":"Black Dog is definitely one of my favorites in Chambana. The food is reasonably priced, consistently great and a fantastic atmosphere. Kudos to the staff, you guys are terrific!"}
{"text":"Yum. Worth the wait. Burnt ends are my favorite. Corn bread and beer could keep me happy for a very long time."}
{"text":"I don't know what has changed- the last 2 or 3 times I've eaten there I've been underwhelmed with the food. Staff is always great and friendly, no complaints there,  but the meat always seems like it's been sitting out and is terribly dry. I realize it's a process and when I smoke my own meat it's obviously going to be juicier right out of the smoker or after a brief rest, but I feel like I showed up to a family bbq 2 hrs after the food was served and am cleaning up the leftovers. Not bad, but I really expect better for the price. $22 for 2 meat combo and a beer not including tip which the ladies that helped me deserved. Hope my opinion changes on the next trip-"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been to Black Dog twice so far. I was really excited before the first visit because of all the great reviews on Yelp, and I ended up being sadly disappointed in my dry beef brisket sandwich and slightly metallic-tasting pit beans (although being that I don't often come across foods that taste of metal, I wrote it off as a problem with my mouth that evening). This experience really struck me deeply...I'd never had an eating experience that contradicted so sharply with a Yelp consensus. Was something wrong with me? I began to feel quite gastronomically insecure.

I gave it a second try recently, opting for a plate of rib tips along with an order of potato salad and corn on the cob. Again, a sunken heart. About half of the rib tips were great, while the other half were terribly dry and tough; I had to force myself to finish them. As for the sides, the corn on the cob was mushy and bland, but the spicy potato salad was pretty enjoyable. We threw a sampler beer flight into the mix, which was probably the best part of the meal (and a good value to boot, being that you net out at more beer for less money than most of the single glasses). 

I'm sorry to say that Black Dog is oh-for-two. Maybe I just had bad luck in picking the worst items on the menu or coming in on bad days, but now that I'm no longer living in the area (this was my last dinner in Chambana), it unfortunately may never have an opportunity to redeem itself again with me. Au revoir, dawg."}
{"text":"Our favorite BBQ place!  I usually get the salmon, which is never dry..always great.  The nachos are the best.  We go the the Champaign location only."}
{"text":"I had the burnt ends, she had the rib tips.  This was way better than any BBQ joints we have in Madison WI!!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ with tasty sides and a great beer list. Wait can be long though. Seating area is small but there is a bar to wait at but seems to be full most of the time."}
{"text":"This place was *AMAZING*. We had a party of 3, and did have a bit of a wait, but the way they seat people is actually entertaining in itself (you sign in on a board). Then once we were seated we ordered drinks, which came quickly (I suggest the Ace Perry Ale!) and wings as an appetizer with smoked Bleu cheese, which was SO GOOD. Wr all 3 got the Burnt Ends and other assorted meat. It was definitely awesome food, best chicken wings any of us have had, and the experience as a whole was GREAT! We will def be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 12, including my twin 8 month old girls. We've been to the Urbana location many times, but never with the twins or this many people! We had a wait... About 30 mins, no biggie, there's usually always a wait! First off, when we were seated the girl offered the high chairs that fit onto the table (MAJOR PLUS IN THE MOM BOOK, major props Mad Dog!!!!) and put them on the table, we got drinks, apps, and meals. The waitress was awesome! She def kept up the best she could, with babies and so many people we were pretty needy! I've read a few reviews about the tip automatically being set to 18% and not being able to change it on the iPad, hit CUSTOM, lol. We opted for 25% tip. This place has amazing food. Wings are the besttttttt. Bleu cheese sauce is amazing. Everyone including the babies loves the cornbread lol. Hands down, best BBQ around!"}
{"text":"It is a solid, safe restaurant. I've yet to try a different BBQ place in the CU area so I don't have any point of comparison. The burnt ends are great and the chicken is also very good. They have a bunch of sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy. None of them really stood out to me and some were very tomato-heavy. The ribs were good, but because none of the sauces really stood out.. then they were a bit underwhelming. 
If you're looking for BBQ, it's a great place to go. You won't be disappointed but it's not out of this world either."}
{"text":"This is one of C/U's most popular restaurant so be prepared to wait if you're coming during peak times! We ended up waiting about an hour to be seated but it was worth it! 

We ordered a Rib Tip Platter and a 1/2 Chicken Platter. Each platter comes with two sides. For this meal, we went with the basic fries and cole slaw. We weren't huge fans of the slaw - it was pretty mediocre. We have gotten other sides before and my boyfriend loves the smoked sweet potato! The meat itself was very good! Smoked to perfection and so tasty! I also love the fact that there are so many sauces to choose from! So great because not all BBQ sauces are created equal! 

Would recommend to anyone looking for a good place to eat in the C/U area!"}
{"text":"I love coming here to eat! Food is always so great and I love the atmosphere! Never a complaint about coming here. I do wish the facility was larger to hold the high quantities of people that are always trying to get in here. The bloody Mary's need a little perfecting. Asking if you like spicy or not might be a good recommendation for the customers just to know what you are getting."}
{"text":"Came at 5:30pm the Friday of homecoming  seeking and was sat by 6. Have a great seat by the window, a little breezy with the door, but get to look down the restaurant and outside.  Fun watching people write their names on the sign in board.  It was nice that we could have a drink while we waiting outside.  We were also able to look at menus while we waited so we didn't lose time.  We were able to order as soon as we were seated.

First they have a great selection of hard ciders.  So for the non-beer drinker I can say hurray! 

First round for appetizer we had the cornbread...oh yeah delicious.  There were 3 of us doing the geometry to divide it up so we each got the same amount.  If we didn't have a ton of other food coming we would have ordered another.

I had the pulled pork with the special chipotle slaw, baked beans, twice baked casserole.  OMG the chipotle slaw was so good on the pork that I ordered another side so I could finish my pork with it.  The smoke in the beans is no joke.  I mean they need to bottle and sell this.  I could eat it all the time.  So good I mixed it into the already amazing twice baked potato casserole.  Heaven! 

Mom had the beef brisket with chipotle slaw with twice bake casserole.  Needless to say, it was eaten with enjoyment.! The brisket just melted in the mouth.  And she was so happy when I ordered more of the chipotle slaw, it also complemented the brisket quite nicely.

Dad had ribs, brisket, and polish sausage with the special side of green beans and smoked sweet potato. As with the rest of the meal yum!  The ribs fell of the bone.  And the pairing of the sausage and the Texas sauce was perfect.

I just never had a bad bite.  In fact we enjoyed our meal so much that my mom is even considering we come back tomorrow night in our way back out of town.

If you are in Urbana you MUST eat here!"}
{"text":"Three words: worth the wait.

Okay, that's five words total, so I'll just add that I awarded 4 stars instead of 5 because we waited for an hour at lunch time. The second location can't come soon enough!

When we were finally seated, Hubby was sad that they were already out of pulled rib sandwiches, so he got the burnt tip sandwich instead. One bite, and he was ready to die happy--that's all it took.

The portions are ample but don't overdo it. Slaw is acceptable, but I like Native Foods' herbed sweet potato fries better. I thought the menu was short on vegetables, but I guess folks come here for the meat and carbs, eh? Word to the wise: even the cornbread has meat in it!"}
{"text":"cheap comparing to its price, gross in amount and the pork in service here are selected in prime condition"}
{"text":"Can I give this more than 5 stars? The food was amazing. Be prepared to wait. It's well worth it though. We came at 1:45 and there was still a line out the door. They were out of some food, but to me that was a good sign. The corn bread was awesome- who would think to put chillies, and pulled pork IN a corn bread? Genius.The pulled pork was big and delicious and SMOKEY. mmm. Potato salad had a nice flavor/kick to it. 

Anyways, I'm sure I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said 245 times already though. Do yourself a favor and get in line at the Black Dog already."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meats! If you arrive early you can get burnt ends. They are so popular they normally are sold out quickly. 

I like Black Dog as a dinner option because they have a lot of options for a gluten free diet."}
{"text":"Great Burnt Ends and Peach BBQ Sauce. Love this place. I'll be back for more. Good service Good food, Great prices - The best."}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ place in the Champaign/Urbana area. The corn bread is far from ordinary with chunks of smoked pork. The twice baked potato side was awesome. The pit beans were just okay. Now for the meat, I had turkey, pulled pork and brisket. They were all very good; the pork was my favorite. The sauces were tasty and unique. They were a little skimpy on the amount of the sauce you got. 
The place is a typical bar and BBQ joint, but clean enough. It was fairly chilly though. The hostess started off our visit bad enough that we almost left without ordering because she sat us ahead of another party and then later asked us to move.  She said that she called a different name, implying we somehow tried to pull something over on her.  However the waitress redeemed her and the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I was back here this week. I went on a Tuesday but they were out of the burnt ends. I came here on a Thursday at 11:15 and I got a seat at the bar. The burnt end are wonderful and melt in your mouth. The potato casserole and cornbread were a perfect compliment to the meal. I was about 2/3 done and started getting a little depressed that I was almost finished."}
{"text":"Great looking, large place, with the same fantastic food. I always get the burnt ends, which are some of the best that I've ever eaten. Their cornbread and potato casserole are equally fantastic! It's so new, there isn't much of a wait if you get there early. Great new addition to the area!"}
{"text":"YUM!  A great selection of bbq foods!  I had the pulled pork with the Sweet Georgia Peach BBQ sauce and it was so yummy! I also choose a side of french fries which were very good as well!  My husband had brisket and catfish and thought it was wonderful as well!  Some of the drinks don't get free refills, but most soda products were available for refills.  This location is kind of small, but each table has plenty of room! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I think they're a bit overrated, but still great. They run out of their burnt ends too quickly, unfortunately. Their cornbread is amazing, though."}
{"text":"Here is the breakdown:
Interior and the decor, very nice, clean and spacious
Service, no hassle checkout. They use ipads and tell you how much you owe on a Screen, you can ask for a receipt or
No receipt. Tips and signature all done ob the screen. Wonder how this works if you pay with cash? Probably go back to the counter and get you change.
-fries, stellar! Best in champaign. Crispy, thin, nicely coated
- cold slaw, lack luster
-corn bread, greasy, can skip the bacon in it
-cat fish sandwich, all it had is a piece of smoked catfish and bbq sauce, inside of toasted sub buns. Poor execution, bbq sauce does not go with the fish
-carolina and blackdog burgers were both good. Flavorful meat, caramelized onion and the bbq sauce goes well with the burger. Carolina burger comes with lettuce and tomato. 

For champaign standards, it deserves a 4. I will be back to try their ribs. Not mind blowing, but above average."}
{"text":"Best BBQ outside of \"the South.\"  Took my BF (from Austin) here and he was a huge fan.  Get a combo plate and try a bit of different meats.  Decent beer selection, although this seems to have decreased since I was in grad school."}
{"text":"I went there when it first opened and was not impressed.  The ribs and brisket were both dry and the sides were ordinary.  The cornbread, however, was moist and delicious, with lots of good things (pulled pork, etc.) inside.  So, although I didn't care for the barbeque, I raved to everyone I knew about how great the cornbread was.

About a year later, I decided to try them again, and ordered some chicken and ribs to go, along with some cornbread.  This time, the chicken was OK, the ribs were still dry, and the cornbread was incredibly dry, with none of the deliciousness I remembered.  I was quite disappointed.

Now, when I drive by and see the lines outside the restaurant, I am amazed.  There is nothing special about it.  I have eaten barbeque at many, many restaurants throughout the country, and, solely based on the quality of the meat without rating the sauce, this would probably rank in my bottom third.  (Sauce is irrelevant to good barbeque- The meat is what matters.)"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic barbecue!  I think I like the Urbana location a bit better because of the smaller, cozier atmosphere, but the Champaign location is pretty nice.  The service is spectacular and fairly quick! I would definitely recommend! They run out of burnt ends quickly, so arrive early if you want those.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating is the fact that they put coleslaw on my burnt ends sandwich and it was kind of gross.  I had specifically asked for it on the side.  I would definitely go back, though!"}
{"text":"I had enormous expectations for this place - with word of mouth and almost 5 star Yelp rating.  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed on my first visit here.  I had the combo plate with 3 meats - burnt ends, ribs and pork belly.  I don't understand the allure of these burnt ends - most of mine were nearly inedible.  It's like reverse Russian roulette - 5 bad bites to each good bite.   The ribs were tasty, but not the best I've ever had.  The pork belly was scraps of dried out meat laced with chunks of fat - pork belly should never ever be dry.  For the sauces, I had the vinegar sauce - hey, it's just vinegar - what up with that?  The mustard sauce was delicious.  On the brighter side, the sweet potato fries were good as were the beans.

Hype is scary, scary thing."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Champaign-Urbana, hands down. Everything on their menu is good (no, seriously). Try something different every time!

My favorite dishes are the beef brisket or pulled pork. My favorite sides are the sweet potato fries, the smoked sweet potato, twice-baked potato casserol, or their slaw.

Special menu items are their \"Burnt Ends\" which are available at 11am and 5pm every day. These sell out quickly, so get a spot in line at 10:30 or 4:30 if you ever want to try these."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Big Ten wrestling meet and a lot of places were super busy.  I checked ahead and saw the great reviews and decided we needed to come here early. 

This place was so good! We came before 5pm, as the place is very small and has limited seating. 

We shared cornbread, ribs and burnt ends. All were excellent. The burnt ends were just something I've never had before. Great flavor and tasty! 

The beer selection is pretty good too. Will come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Love Black Dog. Staff is friendly. Food is delicious. Stellar beers on tap. Totally worth the up to one hour wait. 

Strategy - if you are going on he weekend, arrive 20 minutes prior to opening to get in line. If the line is long already, put your name and QTY of guests in your party on the board and then run over to Bunny's for a round of Bloody Marys. If you show up during peak dinner hours, there will be an hour wait. 

Burnt ends - burnt ends sell out quickly. Make sure to get your order in quickly when they open. 

Platters - platters are a great way to sample several meats and you get two sides. They also have an extensive BBQ sauce list. For a few bucks, you can order all the sauces for your table.

Drink - they have a great beer menu with awesome craft beers on tap. If you like whiskey, there is a tasting menu for that too.

To go - you can do to go orders via phone, however the bartenders are really busy so it may be a wait before they pick up the line. 

Splitting the check - they have a cool tablet-based point of sale system. It is easy for the waitress to split the tab for groups and you pay at your table.

Group size - this restaurant is good for parties of 4 or under. Parties of 1-2 can get sat more promptly as there is seating at the bar. While I see people with kids here, it is not a kid friendly restaurant - very small interior,crowded, loud, not sure if they have high chairs."}
{"text":"As a teacher in Central Illinois, it doesn't really get much better than summer! I moved down here for weather like this! This place is on Broadway Avenue, adjacent to the Bunny Tavern (which I think is associated with this place...I mean, they were advertising the Bunny Tavern's Duck Fat Fries on Sunday in the Black Dog Window). I wish Black Dog had outdoor seating like Bunny Tavern, but onto the BBQ!

One would just assume when dining with a former beauty pageant queen that I would have to practice proper manners and not eat with my hands. I will divulge on this a little later, but keep this in mind!

I arrived about 12:15 and I knew there be a wait......about 15 minutes! It was perfect because my friend Elsie, the aforementioned former beauty queen and fellow PE teacher was across town.

It was like clockwork! She showed up and we were seated! NICE!

Rather than be overwhelmed by all the options of barbecue Nirvana, I did my research via Yelp and Noshfolio. I knew I was getting a combo with 2 sides and two different barbecue sauces.  

I made a fantastic choice with the smoked chicken and the pulled pork! I got some salad and beans, but the highlight of the meal was the chicken FALLING off the bone. Falling, like Fall Out Boy or the season after summer...FALL! Remember when I said that it was falling off the bone? One might ask, \"How do you know if you were eating with a knife and fork?\" I will mention that the chicken came with a thigh that was very difficult to eat with a knife and fork! At this point, Elsie reminded me that she grew up in a family when they had dinner, they sat down and spoke with their mouths full!

I started to eat like a savage caveman who hadn't eaten since the wooly mammoth he killed three weeks ago. Elsie ordered their pulled pork sandwich, famous cornbread, and twice baked potato casserole. She couldn't finish and got a to go box.

I went with the Texas and the Chipotle sauces. I didn't know the difference, and it didn't help when our waiter didn't tell me which was which! I asked and was glad I did because I had them mixed up! I also wanted to buy a medium t shirt to represent Black Dog in Paxton, but to no avail, they only had larges!

I would have given 4.3333333 stars if I could. Assessment is huge as a teacher, but I just can't \"round up\" because of the service! I will be back to try some of their smoked shrimp (Thursdays), fish tacos (Friday), or late night menu! Hopefully the wait staff has some more females working next time I am there! MERCY! Requirement to work on a Wednesday afternoon at Black Dog? Must have crazy facial hair or short curly black hair! See you soon, dog!"}
{"text":"I love the BBQ here! I'm always worried that places with lots of sauces and sandwiches aren't conscious about my gluten free needs but I eat here regularly and haven't had any problems.  The fries are NOT safe for fellow Celiacs, and neither is the corn bread (which I hear is fabulous). I do always make sure to tell them that I have a \"gluten allergy\" and require special attention.  All of the sauces are gluten free as are all of the meats! People don't really rave about the ribs because they are dry rubbed and not fall off the bone but they are yummy.  The brisket and pulled pork are my go-to favs.  The burnt ends, when you can get them, are delicious but people either really love them or really dislike them.  As for sides, the pit beans, apple sauce and potato casserole are all great compliments to their BBQ.  They offer GF beer along with some delicious mixed drinks too!

The wait at the restaurant is generally pretty long (especially during peak times) but you can call in and take out which is generally what we do.  Definitely one of my local favorites!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome BBQ and service.

The wait is worth it. Even though I made sure to go at a time where I wouldn't have to wait. haha.

We got in and our waiter was very polite and liked to joke around. After traveling around Europe for a few months, it was nice to come back to the US and be reminded about how nice people are in the Midwest.

There were a lot of choices for sides and especially BBQ sauces.

I got the beef brisket with fries and cornbread. The brisket was moist and not chewy at all. I was satisfied. 

I would have to say that my favorite part of the meal was the cornbread. It practically had a whole BBQ meal in it. There was meat, beans and it tasted amazing with the butter spread.

I would definitely go back again before I graduate."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. The chicken is the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!
Cornbread is sick !!!
Also try the pineapple tequila. So great to sip with a meal. 
My fav place in CU"}
{"text":"Been eyeing this places for a while and finally hit town early enough to get in the door. Little did I know the burnt ends become available at 5 p.m. After a short wait, I was able to get some ends, chicken and ribs. All were moist and smokey and excellent. They offer a wide variety of sauces, well beyond the typical hot, sweet, ketchup you find at most places. The beans were the perfect side, while the fries were just OK. A small but varied craft lineup and a bigger/better selection of whiskey (Pappy 20) left more drink options than I could even imagine sampling in one visit. A return trip is definitely in order. Just make sure you're here before 5."}
{"text":"The best place in town, and for a long way around. Its national reputation is thoroughly deserved. The food is uniformly great and an outstanding value, doubly so given the very reasonable prices. The service is friendly and quick, especially considering the briskness of the business.

Be prepared to wait a while to get in, to sit in somewhat cramped quarters, to order your second choice because they run out of stuff, and to love every minute anyway because of the food!"}
{"text":"I, like everyone else, have a hard time finding anything bad to say about this place.

I almost always get the beef brisket and a beer, but their pulled pork, chicken, and polish are amazing, as well.  One visit, they had pozole, which was pretty damn good.  The sweet potato fries are a must, but every other side I've tried is amazing, too: pit beans, regular fries, baked potato casserole, and on and on.

It's got a very casual vibe that I like, but it's also not so casual that it's trashy.  There's often local abstract art on the walls, but there's also a huge jug of tequila and pineapple on top of the fridge.  So, there's a desirable balance.

Since this place now has a rep, lunch and dinner times are sometimes kind of crazy.  If you can hit it around 3 p.m. during the week, you usually won't have to wait for a table.

The prices are fair, as long as you don't go too nuts with the beer."}
{"text":"Arrived with 20 minutes until close and we were taken care quite nicely! Also good timing as earlier we were told was an extremely long wait.

The pulled pork and brisket were delicious although the brisket was a bit over cooked for my perfect likening. Sides were good, although with BBQ I like the dinners served with pickles and Jalapeño peppers as well.

BBQ sauces were good as well!
Will be back....."}
{"text":"This place was packed, line out of the door, but the staff were very efficient, fair, composed, and super nice as they managed the ever-growing crowd.  Very good Nosferatu beer on tap along with great pulled pork and sides.  Fries had an unusually delicious flavor - not sure if that was the potato or the oil.  Our waiter was terrific.   Rolls of paper towels on every table. The only thing I'd suggest is that BBQ sauces are available at tables/booths or they are described in detail - the basic sauce they offered me was too spicy for my liking when it comes to pulled pork.  I don't know how many other sauces they had on hand or what they were like, but I would have liked to experiment at the table."}
{"text":"woww, this place is TOP NOTCH! I had to give it 5 stars. I went to the University of Illinois at UC and during my four years there, I never heard of this place. WHAT A SHAME! I have truly missed out. I went there this past weekend after much hype from previous colleagues. The setting is just as you expect it.. always a wait [20-30 mins], very... barbequ-ie. You know, metal trays, easily cleanable, amazing smell, tasty beers, etc.

Anyway, I heard so much about the burnt ends I had to get them. They only serve them twice a day. At least, this is what I am told. They have them when they open and they have them in the afternoon/dinner time. But once they run out, you'll have to wait til next time. :-( saddd face. 

Luckily, They had the burnt ends. Naturally, i ordered them. They were sooooo tender. I can't recall any other meat I've had in my LIFE as tender as these. They literally would fall apart when you picked them up. 

// Burnt ends - DEFINITELY get these. enough said. 

// Cornbread appetizer - easily the tastiest cornbread I've ever had. I think they put bacon in it? or some sort of meat. So soft and savory. It was very unique and definitely should be on your check. 

// Sauce flight - $2 - this is very cool for your first time but I wouldn't get it again. I wanted to try all the sauces but my favorite was the milos mustard. Also the vinegar one is great too. I forgot the name. I would get it your first time to kind of try all the sauces. 

// Sides - all of our sides were veryyyyy good. the FRENCH FRIES were amazing. They must be friend in pork fat. seriously, I have only had fries like that at one other place and they were fried in pure fat [or so i speculated]. Didn't get to try to sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese was good, a bit on the smaller portion.

The only thing i didnt like... was the ribs. They were just a little bit to tough and didn't fall off the bone like i expected. I would opted out of these. But honestly, the burnt ends were so good that it didn't even matter what else I had.

If you are every traveling through the champaign-urbana area... STOP AT THIS PLACE. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"A friend who went to undergrad at UIUC highly recommended Black Dog.  I took an hour break from the Urbana Boulders Boneyard Bouldering Competition to get lunch here and loved it.  Got the combo with ribs and chicken, potato salad and collard greens.  The food was absolutely delicious.  Meats were fallen off the bone tender and had very good flavor.  I paid $2 to get all 8 sauces and really enjoyed trying all those.  Service was great and liked the atmosphere.  I wish I had remembered to get a pound of ribs and chicken to take back to Chicago!"}
{"text":"I do like the food at here.  However, you have to say the have a very BAD hostess.    Loud and like staring at you with her huge eyes.
I was asking to change seats when I was arranged at the cold seat at the end of the bar.  She was so loud that half the room can hear her told me bunch of reason of no.
If I was the owner, I change her.  It is so pity that people away from your restaurant because poor hostess communication skill rather than food."}
{"text":"Real deal barbeque. If you do like quality smoked meats, then you will enjoy black dog. If you get there at 11:00 am or 5:00pm you should be able to get burnt ends. They go quick though! It's all good there. The sides are good too."}
{"text":"Seriously the best BBQ in the area.  I like the pulled pork best.  I have also had the brisket, but it was a little too smoky for me.  I didn't even think that was possible, but it was.  

Chips and salsa are spot on.  You wouldn't think to order them at a BBQ place, but definitely do, they are well worth it.

Hands down favorite thing at this place: cornbread!  It comes out all warm and goey.  It has pork and whole bunch of other stuff in it that make it extra special.  The prices are unbeatable too.  Dinner for two, I'd be shocked if you spent more than $30 total with drinks.  

I've heard the wait can be bad, but I was there on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited maybe 10 minutes.  It was so good though I would wait much longer!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First I want to start off by saying, the twice baked potato casserole is to die for! Please order it if you stop in here, you won't regret it. 

Black Dog is a family owned restaurant & recently opened their new location. I personally have worked with the owner's wife, Kim, and she is delightful. Really good family with good work ethic and super friendly. I had to work Black Friday at the local mall and wasn't able to go home for Thanksgiving dinner, so I was invited to have dinner at Black Dog with Kim, her family, and other co-workers. I was not disappointed! I even saw the smokers they use to smoke the meat! Pretty cool. 

When you enter you have to sign a giant list and the hostess calls up whoever is next and crosses them off. Super cute idea and very unique. Makes the (long) wait go by quickly. 

Definitely stop by if you are ever in the area, even if you don't like smoked food or BBQ, they will have something you can try... (twice baked potato casserole) ;)"}
{"text":"By far the best bbq in Central Illinois.  (been here twice drove all the way from Bloomington)

Brisket had a good smoke, bark and flavor.  While no where near the quality of TX brisket or even Smoque in Chicago, they were still better than anything you'll find at most locations outside of TX. 

Pork was a bit bland but still good especially with their sauces.   

Ribs were a bit tough, needed just a bit more time on the smoker but overall pretty good.   They had an unusual spice that I couldn't quite place though.  

I haven't tried the burnt ends yet, found out they serve them at 11am and 5pm and run out in about an hour.  I hear these are their best bbq item will be back to try them. 

We also tried their chips and salsa they were great,  it had good kick (which was kind of a bad thing since the waitress sucked at refilling drinks)  my only complaint is that it was billed as smokey salsa and I could not detect any smoke to the salsa.  

Sides I've tried 

Pinto beans - mediocre
Smoked sweet potato - ok but not great.  
corn bread - good
French fries - good


A couple more comments - this place is a small restaurant\bar.  Due to the size it stays packed and forces a long wait. (you have to sign your name and can be seated at a table or the bar)  We waited an hour each time.   If it wasn't for the scarcity of quality bbq this place wouldn't be worth the wait.  (In central TX this place would get 2 stars)

Since it is geared more as a restaurant you don't get to talk directly to the meat cutter, the waitstaff wasn't knowledgeable enough about barbecue to relay my wants to the cutter.    So last time when I ordered my brisket \"moist with extra bark\" it came out lean with very little bark.  

One of the kitchen staff \"Kyle\" was awesome and provided great service, when there was a mistake on our order.  He mentioned they are working on opening a larger joint this fall hopefully it will cut down on the wait while not affecting the quality of food."}
{"text":"Never had something I didn't like from here. Decent beer selection, great food, and cozy atmosphere. The service is great and you can tell by the lines you see outside on any given night that its the best BBQ in town. Get there early, before the burnt ends are gone!

My suggestion: They have a bacon bleu (I think?) burger that goes great with the Georgia peach bbq sauce and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places I've ever been to.  There was a huge wait, but it was totally worth it.  I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"came here based on recommendation, drove around for 10 minutes before seeing a little sogn by the drive way showing where it was.

The beer menu is extensive with lots of options to meet everyone's taste. 

as a starter I had the chips and salsa. The chips are light and crispy and the salsa was AMAZING, fresh and full of flavor and with a little kick. 

After reviewing the menu I decided on the combo platter with pulled pork and chicken with the smoked sweet potato and corn bread, playing it safe I went with the Georgia peach bbq sauce. 

The pulled pork was AMAZING nice smoky flavor and then dipped with the bbq was a great combo. I wish I got that instead of the chicken and I'm a chicken lover. 

The smoked sweet potato was great, skin and all no butter needed. 

Being from New York the corn bread was not want i expected. flavor was ok but had a bunch of other things mixed into. 

once I ordered it took maybe 10 minutes before my food arrived at the table,  it's served slightly above room temperature. service was attentive. I will be back"}
{"text":"Beer flights and food were amazing here!!  We had a very cool server and the atmosphere makes you want to stay and drink several beer flights!  Best BBQ in Chambana!"}
{"text":"Simply awesome. Incredible BBQ. Fantastic specials. Great drink selection. CANNOT GO WRONG. The biggest downside is the wait (often 30+ minutes). \

When you get there you write your name down on butcher paper and it is your job to know where you are on the list. You can't call ahead to make a reservation and they won't seat your till everyone in your party is there. 

Also, their Wednesday Cuban special is nothing short of incredible. This is BY FAR the BEST Cuban I have ever had. 

But if you can get a seat you will not be disappointed. DONT leave champaign/urbana without having tried Black Dog"}
{"text":"We totally plan any trip home from Florida so that we'll land at the Black Dog Smoke and Ale House around lunch.  We shared smoked ends as an appetizer.  (to die for!),this time I enjoyed one of the specials: a salad with creole vinaigrette dressing and a smoked chicken w/mole burrito with a Virginia vinegar sauce. So. Very. Delicious. My husband had a smoked Polish sausage sandwich (grilled) with the mustard sauce and sweet potato fries and a double crowned tree IPA and a Londoner smoked porter, both on draught.  Shared smoked ends as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Black Dog Smoke and Ale never disappoints! The Big Thorn Milk Stout was a delightful accompaniment to the burnt ends platter we decided to split. It was  enough for these travelers with a bowl of the green beans and a sweet potato as sides. We loved the Carolina Sauce and ordered it to go along with some Milo's Mustard. That way we can take a gastronomic reminder home with us to Minnesota until our next trip through Champaign."}
{"text":"I'm skeptical of suggestions.

Really, it's more I don't know you, you don't know me, how do you know what I might enjoy or have a taste for?

In this case I'm glad I put aside my thoughts on the matter, followed the bartender's suggestion and got the Burnt Ends.  Speaking of which, you don't know me and I don't know you but you should get it.  Really.  It's an awesome smoked and resmoked brisket sandwich that is so many layers of delicious, it's stupid.  It's juicy, flavorful and the sauce is done just right; present but not overwhelming.  The slaw is a correctly done supporting cast in the sandwich.  Also, coming it at around $7, it was easily tastier than more expensive crap I've paid for out here on the West Coast.

Combine this hunger inducing (and curing) sandwich with a delightful Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout enjoyed on draft (not to mention the availability of a number of craft beers on draft and in bottle) and the chill atmosphere and I was more than happy I braved the rain to visit this spot before heading back to Chicago.

Even if it wasn't in Urbana, this place would be able to hang in any big city either as just a beer bar or as a BBQ place.  I'll thank my lucky stars it does both."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food specials and drinks, with daily specials and lots of homemade goodness, you'll definitely love this little bbq joint! The Pineapple or Raspberry/Pepper margaritas are so refreshing, peppery, and  boozy. If you want to try a variety of different bbq meats, get the combo meals, choice of two meats and two sides.  The local chicken is to die for, smokey and tender, in fact, I'd say it's the theme for  all the bbq'd meats there! Black Dog offers different house made sauces too...the peach is really good, sweet, and spicy!  You need to get there early for lunch/dinner; popular items can run out pretty quickly.  Great prices, portions, and always a line out the door, Black Dog is a must to check out."}
{"text":"Just ordered a salad there. Half way through my meal my wife shouts \"there's a worm in your salad!\". I say what? She says \"there! It's moving! \" there it was, scampering across the bowl! I jumped up, got the waitress and she said \"oh my god\". I said \"we're out of here\" and she said \"ok\".  We are walking out of there fast and telling everyone waiting about what happened.  As we leave my wife is laughing so hard she has to pee. I'm mad at myself for not getting a video of that thing scurrying across my plate. Funny thing was 10 minutes before I told the waitress we had not been there for a couple of years after a bad experience there! And oh by the way we waited 40 minutes for the wormy salad! Black dog never again!  (Can i give it less than 1??)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best barbeque and burger joint in that area and arguably one of the best in the nation. The line could get long but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Urbana anymore and this is definitely one of the places I miss the most! 
I have never once been disappointed by the food or service at this place.
Do yourself a favor and start off with the Texas Caviar as an appetizer, you can thank me later.
I normally always got the smoked salmon sandwich. I've never been a huge fan of coleslaw, but the way theirs is prepared, and ON the actual sandwich, is just delicious. The sweet potato fries are too good as is any other side I've ever ventured to try.
Also the, I think it's called the Carolina burger, a fat delicious burger with pulled pork on top is really good too!
You may very well have to wait, but it is so so so worth it."}
{"text":"This place screams comfortable. There is a warm atmosphere to the décor.  The barbeque is excellent. I have to say the burnt ends and pulled brisket is my favorite. I suggest trying a flight of sauces if you are a first time visitor. The sauces alone are fantastic. Trying mixing different flavors. It really brings the meat out. Get a craft beer while you are at it. As for sides, I normally get the sweet potato fries, twice baked casserole or the smoked sweet potato for dinner. Any are awesome choices, though. I do also enjoy the specials. They are always unique and flavorful. Oh, if you get a sandwich see if you can cheese on it. Especially if you get multiple sauces on the sandwich instead of on the side.

The wait is normally long but if you are with someone, good conversation will make them the time go by quick. If you are alone, bring a book."}
{"text":"Easily the best barbecue in Champaign-Urbana. The smoked pork ribs are one of the best ribs I've ever tasted. But my go-to has to be the BURGERS. The Texas burger comes with a patty, cheese, brisket, and their famous Texas sauce. For $10, it's a great amount of food, as it also comes with one side. Great burgers, their twice baked potato casserole is a huge hit, best ribs ever, huge fan of the fries, and you can't go wrong with the burnt ends (better go early before they sell out). 

Service is also always great. Food comes out fast. They got these sick new iPads that each waiter carries with them when it's time to pay - quick, efficient, super hip. Super fan of Black Dog."}
{"text":"The Black Dog Smoke and Ale House made its way onto my radar yesterday when I was frantically searching for a place to eat while traveling through Champaign, IL. I called for take out in the late afternoon. The customer service on the phone was pretty good, the phone cut out a few times and the woman patiently waited instead of just hanging up. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich with hot Georgia peach BBQ sauce, a sweet tea and a side of mac and cheese, as well as a grilled cheese on sourdough and a side of fries. 

When I arrived at the location it was sort of hard to find for someone who was visiting. It is behind a set of two buildings on a backroad that the map doesn't even show. I parked on a street a little bit father away and had to walk over to find it. Upon arriving the staff was very friendly. They rang me up for my order and made sure that everything was correct. However, in order to get your to go orders you have to walk down to a cramped kitchen window and basically ask for your food. It wasn't super busy but there were still people hanging around the area and I found it rather troubling to do it this way. I am use to the food simply being brought to the counter for me by someone who works at the restaurant. 

The order was correct but we were not provided with any napkins, plastic silverware, etc. The food was pretty awesome, the pork was tender, the fries were amazing, and the sweet tea was perfect. This place clearly knows what it's doing and is definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is our standby if we want good food and we don't want to have to worry about service.  They do their thing and they do it spectacularly. And I love their bar selection of bourbons and whiskies. A gem. We're lucky to have it."}
{"text":"This small eatery is generally very busy so be prepared to wait, especially at dinner hour.  IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT
Don't forget to go inside and put your name in the chalkboard.
This is by far the BEST barbecue ever. Huge serving of pulled pork, brisket,  several combo plates.  Did I mention the sides. corn bread with pulled pork inside, loaded potato casserole, coleslaw like granny used to make!  
Smoky, tender, juicy!  Several sauces to choose from-- from mild to HOT- ask for a sample or get the flyte offering to share
Several says a week Black Dog offers smoked turkey. It is amazing!
If you are lucky you might get the \" burnt ends\". So far they are out each time I have visited. 
Decor is funky. Staff have all been excellent. Just the right balance of attention and very friendly, even on super busy Friday nights!!
Try it. You will become a Black Dog addict!!"}
{"text":"Service can be a hit or a miss here, and that's the only reason I'm taking off a star. The food, however, is great! We usually get the BBQ nachos (get the burnt ends as your choice of meat if they have any!!!), which are always a good time as an appetizer and we love it! I've had the brisket sandwich before when we are just doing lunch but I also enjoy the rib tips as a dinner entree. The rib tip platter IMO is a great value if you don't mind having to sort through some fattier pieces, but you get 2 sides and a whole lot of meat for a great price! My favorite sides would have to be the twice baked potato casserole and also fries! Friends have also said that their sweet potato fries are good. I've also never had a sauce that was terribly bad, but I'd have to say my favorite is the Carolina Red!

Black Dog is a Champaign staple and reasonably priced too, definitely a great place for a casual dinner with friends/SO, or to bring your parents to when they visit campus."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal! Came here with our toddler after seeing a game at UIUC at about 9:00. Wait staff is phenomenal. They were out of many things, but we were prepared for this thanks to other Yelpers. What we were able to get was PHENOMENAL. 
Had the flight of sauces and we were very impressed. We rarely go to a BBQ place and like all of their different sauces, but Black Dog has hit a home run with each and every one! Our favs were the mustard, Texas BBQ, Carolina red and Lexington dip. 
Brisket was awesome. The vinaigrette they make for the salads is super. And they had a great beer menu.
We loved it and will definitely be making an excuse to do the 2.5 hour drive again!
The only thing we wouldn't get again was the cornbread because it was very salty. But if you're a first-timer, you need to try it because it's so different!
We loved it."}
{"text":"Cornbread.  Cornbread.  Did I mention cornbread?
You can't go wrong here and if there is a line, it's WELL worth the wait.  Get here early as some things tend to run out (as is normal at a BBQ spot) but you'll never be stuck without something delicious to order.  Try the cornbread"}
{"text":"Out of several items, including the special which they teased on the front whiteboard and then did not have. 2nd choice out of stock also. Then when it came time to pay, I had to deal with a computer interface which was demanding a preset selection of tips. The food we did manage to obtain was edible."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of BBQ (that's why I've waited this long to come here eventhough it gets great reviews), but I really enjoyed my meal here. I've always thought of BBQ as something people put together during the summer, not the kind of food you need to go to a restaurant for, but Black Dog's BBQ was simply the best I've ever had (but I guess that doesn't say much for a person who doesn't really go to restaurants that serve BBQ).  Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Worth the wait every time!  Brought visitors from Chicago and they said it beats anywhere in Chicago.  Cannot wait for the new place.  Hope they keep doing what they do now."}
{"text":"I have been to barbecue places all over the country form KC to Texas and throughout the South.  This is as good as it gets.  If there is any complaint is that there can be a wait, but that speaks more to how good the food is than anything else."}
{"text":"This is the new place to go in Champaign for a casual bbq eats.

First off.. the beer sampler is the way to go.  I was impressed with six beers for barely anything.

Second.. the waiters are friendly but they definitely didn't offer the best advice on food.  The person I was with greatly advised that we get the appetizers:  burnt ends (which is basically brisket and was really delicious but spicy) and cornbread (good but I've had better).

Tried the get two platter.. the catfish is dry and I would definitely skip it.  I would have gotten brisket again but I wanted to be adventurous and went for the pulled pork.  Meh.. it's okay.  I had the Georgia Peach bbq sauce which was sweet but spicy.

As for drinks.. the white Manhattan was not good.  Then they were out of all vermouth so they couldn't really make me an Old Fashioned or anything else for that matter.  I think I had a Cosmopolitan.  Ummmm.. it wasn't that good either.  Probably best to stick with beer at this spot."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best smoked fish sandwich, coleslaw, BBQ sauce, the Carolina Red, and corn bread* I've ever had. I though this place may be overrated but I was really wrong; the fish is like biting into heaven, a delicious smoked, smooth, delicate heaven. I really recommend this place and there is no wait between the lunch and dinner hours so that's a plus too but I would be OK to wait a couple of hours for this food. The service here was great too and I felt very welcome; the alcohol selection looked really decent and I will go back to have a beeer with my smoked fish next time. 
*The corn bread has some sort of smoked meat in it. I didn't realize this until after eating half of it; it was my fault though as the menu clearly marks vegetation options, including sides."}
{"text":"I love the newest Black Dog, there is no better BBQ place around, besides the Urbana location, maybe. The smoked catfish and various sauces here are my favorite. I really like the atmosphere and even though there is usually a line, the food is worth the wait. The staff are always friendly and the prices fair, definitely an awesome place."}
{"text":"Superb BBQ!  They have daily specials, but they also run out of certain items by lunchtime.  Speaking of lunchtime, be ready for a ~15 minute wait, even for a party of 2-3.  Once you're seated, the service is good, and the aforementioned BBQ makes it worth the wait.  I spotted a solid selection of craft beer; I'll have to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"The best barbecue I've had! Cool atmosphere, and good beer. Worth the long wait times, but take out is about 20 minutes. Can't go wrong with the smoked sweet potato!"}
{"text":"There is good BBQ, There's Great BBQ, and then there's the Black Dog. Having eaten at some of the best voted BBQ places in the world (Skyway in Oregon, Lucy's/Dickies in LA) I can honestly say that the Black Dog stands right along with them and is the best BBQ here in town. Their brisket has a deep smoke ring and their ribs are excellent. The only downside to me is that their sauces aren't the best (I love the Ghost pepper sauce). I recommend sticking to the Urbana Location, I know it's supposed to be the same but the food seems to always be better there. The best thing that I've ever had their is the Cuban Sandwich on Wednesday nights, it's seriously to die for. Give them a try, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I must sadly say that I did not have a good eating experience driving up highway 57. There does not appear to be much in the UC area, and Urbana seems to be the better of the two. I say all of this to say that this place is what I am used to when it comes to good food. Fresh, tasty , cooked to order and friendly people. We ordered the burgers and rib tips to get an idea of the BBQ. I love BBQ but have grown tired of people saying they have great BBQ when it is obviously not. This place has succulent BBQ the kind that just makes your mouth say yes yes yes, it was like a big O in the mouth.  Did I say clean and I did not feel sick or a disgusting aftertaste after my dinner as I did from a few places this trip. Bravo to the staff and owner for making this a bright foodie oasis in a dessert of hum drum and disgusting."}
{"text":"By far one of the highlights of my business travel thru town is eating and drinking in here. Great atmosphere. Usually pack with people but well worth the wait. I had the chip and salsa for appetizer. Which had a smoke taste to it. Amazing. And the brisket sandwich with baked beans.. Bartenders were friendly and attentive. I could not stop smiling being in this establishment."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere to eat about a year ago, and noticed this place on the internet, so we dropped in to try it out.  Im not a fan of BBQ usually, but love this place. They bring the food without meat already smothered in sauce, and you can choose between several mild to so hot you can't stand it BBQ sauces.  My husbands favorite is their gigantic beef ribs called flints. I think the pulled pork is the best Ive ever had and I really like the burnt ends.  We like the casual environment.  The staff are friendly and the service is great.   They don't have TV's blaring or loud music blasting in your ear which I appreciate. Its a good place to eat and now sometimes I even drop in for carry out."}
{"text":"I love barbecue in all its incarnations: Chicago, Carolina, Texas, and Kansas City to name a few. If you do as well, I don't think Black Dog will let you down. This review is for the original Urbana location, although they now have a larger restaurant in Champaign as well. Situated in a renovated but unremarkable old building, it is functional with seating in booths, tables, and at the bar. The only downside of this location is that there is often a wait at lunchtime.

Using their custom-made smokers, Black Dog puts out a varied array of tasty meats. These include Polish sausage, brisket, pulled pork, turkey along with some less common offerings like salmon and free-range chicken. Selections are accompanied by your choice of sauces up and down the heat scale from mild to Ghost Pepper hot.  My personal preferences are the mild and sweet Georgia Peach and the medium hot Carolina Red. You can mix and match to get it the way you want. You can order meat in combos (your choice of two or three meats) with two sides and sauce. Sandwiches and salads are also available if you're leaning towards a lighter meal.

To complete the deal, you'll want a couple of side dishes. Black Dog has typical choices you'd expect in a barbecue joint: Cole slaw, beans, corn bread. These are decent but are not stand out quality for me. On some days you can get the Mac and cheese and I do recommend that.

The one thing that keeps me from giving Black Dog five stars is the service. To be sure, you're always welcomed as family here. What I never know is if that family is the Cosby's or the Addams'. The inconsistency in training and/or personalities is a bit of a turn off, as is the wait time. If you don't want to wait or if you like their burnt ends (limited supply daily and treated as a local delicacy) be sure to arrive early. Overall, it's a definite hit."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat something here I don't like. Ask anyone who knows me, I am picky and this is the ONLY place I have been that I like everything I have ordered. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I guess the only negative is everytime I go in there is around a 30min wait for a table, but it is worth it, and I think they need a kids menu. I am moving to the St.Louis area and I am going to miss this place! I am going to have to find excuses to come up!"}
{"text":"Yes the food is incredibly tasty. But this is a restaurant review. I personally think it's my hard to make good barbecue, most decent places I go to I love. This place isn't any better! In fact I would argue it is worse! If you want to wait an hour for your food be my guest. If you want to overpay for your barbecue food be my guest. If you want to go to a restaurant and be shoulder to shoulder with people go right ahead. Most overrated restaurant in the entire champaign area by far."}
{"text":"Recently learned they opened a branch in Champaign. The place is very spacious compared to their original Urbana location. I love it because it means less waiting time! It is still equally crowded, which is a great sign of their unwavering quality.

Ordered Burnt Ends, and their Sunday special Pork Belly platter. They never disappoint, especially when it comes with 2 sides and 2 sauces. Their potato casserole is really flavorful, and tastes even better with the sauces. 

I am just glad they did not run out of the Burnt Ends when I came to visit this weekend!

The price is on the higher end with little-than-usual portion and worth the quality of the meat. The portion (including sides) does make you full. My friends initially complained about the small portion when their food came, and ended up struggling to finish the last bites. And mind you they are one of the heavy eaters I know in my life...

Kudos for the helpful and always-smiling waitress that helped me and my party of 13. She made our dining experience a great one."}
{"text":"Don't really like barbecue food but since this is really famous I went with friends.
Good thing is they have bar compared to Lil Porgy, but Porgy is much cheaper."}
{"text":"Very yummy bbq! I ordered the rib tip platter and the meat was sooo tender and delicious. The wait can be very long, should expand or move to a much bigger place. The last time I went, our server was not very welcoming or energetic and didn't check on us to say the least. But usually the other employees are great! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Best. Corn. Bread. Ever. 
If your mama ain't around slap someone else. 
Rib tips are sublime. 
Digging into my Burnt Ends now. 
Coleslaw was meh. Everything else was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm pretty judgmental about BBQ.  I make a lot of my own at home, so I will admit to being a little critical when I get BBQ from restaurants.  Black Dog does a lot of things right, but some things (particularly the Burnt Ends) are overhyped, in my opinion.

The new location is really nice and a completely different experience from the Urbana location, because there is so much more space and the wait times are nowhere near what they were in Urbana.  I've eaten in at the new location a few times now for lunch and it's a good experience.  Service is almost always very good.

A group of coworkers and I recently went for lunch.  We got there right after open (shortly after 11AM) and just walked right in for a table of 6.  Most of us got 2-item combo platters with some combination of pulled pork, brisket, burnt ends, and catfish.  One diner ordered the small Beef Ribs and it came with three huge beef ribs that looked REALLY good.   I personally got the pulled pork and brisket and it was all very good, except that the brisket was a bit drier than I like it.   One diner that got pulled pork and burnt ends said that he preferred the brisket to the burnt ends, and I tend to agree.  Burnt Ends are best (in my opinion) when you chunk them up, season them, and re-smoke them.  I've found the Burnt Ends at Black Dog to just be smaller pieces of brisket that are more fatty.  Like everything else related to BBQ, it's a subjective taste thing, but that's just my opinion.

We ordered a flight of sauces ($2) to try, in addition to the sauces that came with our meals.  The habenero sauce is not part of the flight, but two of my companions got it with their meals and said that it was very good, and very hot.  I always get the Hot Georgia Peach, but it was overly sweet on this visit, and I enjoyed the Texas Red more than the Peach this time.  I usually don't care for Carolina-style sauces since most are vinegar-based, but the Carolina Red was pretty good too.

Price-wise, I feel that they are just a bit high for our area, but that's a common thing around here.  We have a number of BBQ places around C-U that are more affordable, but some are not even close in quality so your mileage may vary based on your tastes.   

Overall, I definitely recommend it, and will likely continue to go back for both eat-in and takeout.

Note:  They do NOT accept American Express."}
{"text":"Burnt. Ends.  As a native Kansan, where burnt ends originated, I can tell you that they  get it right!  Delicious!   The pulled pork and meatloaf are also very good.  The salads could use more veggies and greens as they aren't as filling as you'd hope, but I suppose if you really want a salad you should probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is SO worth the wait. The BBQ is so amazing, staff is friendly.  Small, small eating area and a long line..but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Although a bit pricey, I can say that the food was well worth the money. Everything on the menu appeared and tasted appetizing, as if each meal was meticulously made with love and care (sorry this sounds pretty cheesy). The waiters were friendly and easily accommodated to our every need. The only improvement this restaurant would be to expand it. The limited amount of space makes the waiting time excruciatingly long and tedious as there are simply not enough seats to place everyone. Be prepared to possibly wait 45 minutes before being seated. Despite this, Black Dog has to be one of the greatest BBQ grill restaurants in the area and everyone has to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and amazing beer! Brunt ends are a must. But the brisket is just as good."}
{"text":"Black Dog is definitely one of my favorite places in Champaign. I've been here too many times to count and honestly crave it from time to time after graduating college. There is the problem of sometimes food running out, especially their burnt ends, but I'm one of those people that is very gungho about eating food in general so I will be the first person here on a Saturday morning if I must eat Black Dog. My general go-to in terms of food is the two meat combo platter with burnt ends and ribs and some combination of the potato casserole, mac and cheese, fries or sweet potato fries. The Hot Georgia Peach is my favorite sauce as its sweet and hot and tangy and in my opinion the most flavorful of the sauces. 

Recently visited Champaign and was here on a Sunday morning for their brunch! Had never had brunch at Black Dog for all the times I've been there, I didn't even know they had a brunch menu. Had the pork belly platter and their brisket hash. A great deal of food, and the pork belly was fatty and delicious and fell apart when you eat it. Yum. The brisket hash was also so amazing, so flavorful and great. Would recommend people to come for brunch as well. A great place for meat lovers, a great place for a dinosaur eating all the cows like me."}
{"text":"No. Just no. I went to the Urbana location a year ago and the food  was excellent. Today I tried the Champaign location and got the same exact meal. I got the rib tip platter which was served to me all in bags and brown paper wrappers. The grease had completely soaked through the wrappers and bags!  No container provided. The  tips had zero seasoning. The twice baked potato was not fresh. I got wings as an appetizer. While they were well seasoned and kinda tasty  they were swimming in grease.  I'm disappointed and a little scared. I think I feel my arteries hardening. I wouldn't recommend this location based on my visit today.  Hard to find in an old train station. Friendly staff.  Food...not so much."}
{"text":"So... wow... this place was busy.

I came to this place on a Wednesday night before the dinner rush and there was still a wait. The wait wasn't too bad, there was about 20-30 minutes before we were seated. This was at 5:45 pm. 

This place is apparently packed every night. So if you come here expect a wait... But wait. It's very worth it. 

So you walk up to free outside of this place and you can already smell the bbq smokey goodness. It only gets better from here. If you can get lucky enough to wait inside during a hot summer day... You're already doing pretty well. 

So you finally have a table. Grab a menu and order the burnt ends sandwich... I've never had anything like this before. I've had a lot of bbq coming from the south and living here the majority of my life. But the beef brisket here is amazing. It's more tender than any other beef brisket... drool... order it with the Carolina Red sauce. So good. Soooo good. The sweet potato fries are also good too. Corn bread... mmmm. The only thing that I could have done without is the slaw. Meh... I've had much better slaw, but in the sandwich is good. It compliments the rest of the flavors. 

Can we get back to that beef brisket? The end... get the burnt ends sandwich. That is all..."}
{"text":"If I could, I would eat here every day. 

Here are some pointers in case you want a taste of heaven.
- Don't pass up the sweet potato fries
- Dine in, it's worth the wait - you'll leave smelling like BBQ and they'll overload your tray with fries
- Ask to try other sauces - they're more than willing to accommodate your curious taste buds
- Get 2 orders of their pork belly special on Saturdays, cause they're closed on Sundays
- Its hard for me to order anything else but burnt ends
- Seating is limited...VERY limited
- Go for late lunch or early dinner, otherwise you'll find yourself in a line out the door
- TRY THE CORN BREAD. Best corn bread I've ever had - cheese and pulled pork baked into it! My mom doesn't let me come into the house unless I bring her at least 4 orders of this stuff when I come home from school."}
{"text":"Most excellent BBQ in the midwest.  Great variety of sauces to try.  Get the burnt ends if they are still available when you get there (they come off the smoker at 11 am and 5 pm).  Also after 5 pm they have a smoked sweet potato.  

Also they have a great rotating tap list so check them out throughout the year."}
{"text":"I will concede that as someone who grew up in Champaign, and has since moved away, I tend to be a bit nostalgic about the town and may romanticize it a bit. I had never been to Black Dog when I lived in town, but on a recent visit some good friends told me it was THE place to go. 

We arrived around lunch time and we expected to wait for a table. The restaurant sits MAYBE 30 people, and this is a good thing. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which given the number of people and the small seating area, I thought was pertty good.

Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. I ended up ordering brisket and pulled pork. Both were delicious. The smoke ring on the brisket was a beautiful color and all the flavor was there. The house BBQ sauce which came with the meal was EXCELLENT and though I have heard that they have several other options, I'm not sure there would ever be any need.

Another bonus was that Black Dog had a small, but great, beer selection. They had 7 beers on draft, all of which were really good. They offered a sampler of 4 oz. pours, which was a great thing to enjoy with my meal.  It was a LITTLE nerdy that the beers were served in a \"dog bone\" shaped serving platter, but I suppose it was fun.

Overall, I had a great experience at Black Dog and I would love to return on my next visit."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place and we decided to try it while we were visiting family in Urbana-Champaign. I had never had burnt ends before until we tried Black Dog. After having the burnt ends sandwich, I would be more than inclined to try them again (both the restaurant and the dish). The flavors were rich and smokey, and the sauces perfectly complimented the meats  and dishes overall. Our server was very personable, and helpful when we needed to make menu decisions. A nice sort of tavern atmosphere with heavenly smells and an energy that resonates from the busy environment. I can not recommend this restaurant highly enough, when we are in the area again, we'll no doubt be asking about Black Dog."}
{"text":"They know what they're doing here when it comes to BBQ!  

I might even say that this is the best BBQ joint I've ever been too?   

Yeah.  

I think I will say it.  

It is!  

Before you say it....I've been to Kansas City and to Memphis BBQ joints.  This BBQ is better. 

Words of advice.  Get here early--before 7pm if possible. 

Because this place is so popular they run out of everything.  

It's Thursday night and they're out of Mac N Cheese, Salmon, Burnt Ends, Beef Tips and Turkey. But then again it's 850pm.  So that makes sense.  

I know what you're thinking...\"why would I go there if they have nothing to eat and they run out of everything?!\"

Get here early!  

Why don't they make more food?  

I don't know...and I don't care!  Get here early.  

Service is great!  Friendly!   Great beer!  

I've only been to the Champaign location--I'm sure Urbana is just as great--same owners.  


One bummer...they don't take American Express.   This is 2016 guys!  Come on!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for perfect barbeque, come on over to Urbana and experience the wonder that is Black Dog Smoke and Ale House. Ooof. I didn't know what a treasure we had in CU until I left the Midwest for the bustling East Coast. There, I kept getting email and newsletters that kept telling me that all the way back in CU was one of the country's best BBQ joints! And boy, can you tell the difference when dining in other BBQ locations (granted, I'm trying BBQ on the East Coast, that's mistake #1). 

But I finally got to come back to Black Dog just a few days ago and boy...boy was this a happy moment. 

After puzzling through their menu of mouth-watering items (whole platter of burnt ends? Or the pulled pork? Or brisket? Nevermind, got it all), we put down our orders with our very friendly and amused waitress. 

While we wait for our food, let me describe the place that is Black Dog. It's a cozy little joint that always has a decent crowd of people milling around the outside of its brick building, all waiting for a coveted table inside. Once you make it in, the interior is kinda small. Full of tall wooden tables towards the front and then lined with a couple booths as you head further back. Right across from the booths is the long full bar. It's a warm and cozy looking place, you know, not upscale or fancy in any way, but with that wooden glow that just makes you feel at home and the smell of all of that meat...

Our bbq platters are brought out on these cute and convenient tin trays. Aside from their meat, their must-try sides are: sweet potato fries, twice-baked potato casserole and their corn bread. Mmmf you can't go wrong with any of those.

Let's start with the meat. The burnt ends. You better get to Black Dog early if you want to sample these babies. Melt in your mouth, smokey, delicious goodness. A perfect ratio of fat and meat. Uuugh. I could have eaten two platters worth of these if I didn't care a wit about my waistline. 

Then there's the pulled pork. Not the strangely dry stringy pulled pork you might get from other joints. This pulled pork is long, thick, and moist. The bbq sauce you get on the side is perfect for adding the tang/flavor you want--you don't need it to restore moisture back to pulled pork, that's for sure.

Then there's the brisket. Tender and juicy. Mmmmf. I don't think I've ever had brisket as flavorful or tender as this. 

So yes. Champaign-Urbana. You got something good. Real good. I'm super curious about what their new Champaign location is going to be like (it's supposed to be bigger--thank goodness haha). Just don't lose that beautiful quality of yours, Black Dog! I'll bear all the long lines as long as you stay just as good as you are now."}
{"text":"One thing you worry about when it comes to new branch locations is: \"Is the quality and feel going to be the same?\"

Well, the seating/dining area of the Champaign Black Dog isn't ready yet, but this new branch is taking carry-out orders! I am pleased to report back that the taste and quality that you've experienced and loved in the original Urbana location is definitely here. 

I called in ahead of time to order 4 platters for the family: burnt ends, beef brisket, salmon, and pulled pork. 20 minutes later, I pulled into downtown Champaign and into their new parking lot.

This new Black Dog is situated in an old train depot building. It's a little bit hidden off the intersection of Main St and Chestnut, just around the corner from establishments like Memphis Off Main and etc...makes me wonder if this Black Dog might be open as a late night option for those of us who make a night out of downtown Champaign. 

The new interior looks beautiful. Full of polished and warm woody browns. I'm super excited for when I come back to Illinois to try dine-in when this place opens up entirely. 

As for the food, the pick-up was easy enough and after unwrapping the beautiful feast before us, my family came away stuffed and quite happy. All the meat is tender and moist. Again, in Black Dog goodness, the BBQ sauce is delicious and great augmentation to the flavors of the meat. That meat doesn't need sauce in order to be juicy and moist. Praise be!

Also, let me tell you. I ordered their smoked salmon for the first time and yes. Please. That is some of the best salmon I've had in a long time. Just like the red meats, the salmon is moist and tender and flakey. Not a hint of dryness in there and just oh so smokey. Why haven't I tried this sooner?

So yes, Champaign Black Dog is just as good as Urbana Black Dog, so don't be scared! Come enjoy this place just as much! It probably isn't as crowded as the Urbana location for carry out anyways...Shhhhh"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem. There is a reason for the long wait times to dine in. The staff is very personable and really show that they are working hard for your convenience and experience. The atmosphere is very positive and comfortable. 

The beer selection is really diverse through their large selection of bottled and on-tap craft beers, along with top to bottom liquor shelf. 

The food is the reason this place is so popular. It's the best barbecue in the area and some of the best I've ever had. My favorites are the chicken, brisket, pulled pork, and burnt ends. The sides are to die for and it doesn't matter if you get a platter or a sandwich it's always amazing."}
{"text":"Black Dog all you need to know is it is scary good. Line may be out the door but it is worth the wait. This is grown man Barbeque!"}
{"text":"Black Dog might be one of the best things that has happened to Champaign-Urbana. I'm not a barbecue connoisseur, but I think that's what makes this place so great. I feel like it's just a type of barbecue that can be enjoyed by all without having to have a sophisticated palate. What I really like is that they offer such a variety of BBQ sauces that can top quality meats that transform the type of barbecue into different regional barbecues. 

I know that this is not the most popular item here, but I usually just opt to get a pulled pork sandwich either with one side, or a combo platter which offers a choice of two meats, two sides, and I think two sauces as well. The burnt ends sell out regularly, but I'm not a huge fan because I don't really like the burnt parts... yeah, I know, I'm not really sure why I ordered the BURNT ends... but I just wanted to see what the deal with these were. I know people will hate me for this, but I picked off all the burnt fatty pieces... and then my friends made sure they didn't go to waste, thank goodness. My husband has gotten the rib tips and really enjoyed them.
My favorite sauce is the Georgia Peach (or the hot Georgia Peach) which really tastes like good \"typical\" barbecue sauce- sweet, tangy, and a little peppery (and a little heat if you get the hot Georgia Peach). All the sides here are so good. One of my favorites is the mac and cheese, it's a nice little heap of creamy cheesy goodness. Another favorite is the fries (and sweet potatoes fries as well) because it's the type of fry that has a nice thin coating of crispy crunchiness all around, each fry and all parts of the fry is just delicious. The twice baked potato is also a solid choice. The corn bread is not my favorite, it was just a little too dry for my taste. Basically, I think all the sides are good, but how much you will enjoy it will be based on personal preference. 

I think the prices aren't too bad especially if you are just getting a sandwich. The atmosphere is also very homey and warm. The service every time I've gone has been good and friendly. It's no wonder they always have such a wait during peak meal times on even the most random days. Opening the second location (in Champaign which is a lot roomier)  helped to tame the crowds a little. If it's your first time there, make sure you either get your name written down or write your name on the large pad at the front to make sure you are in line to get seated. There have been several times there was a minimal wait, but it's usually during the summer when everyone at U of I goes home or kind of in between meal times. 

Never had a bad experience here, except for maybe overeating. If you are looking for solid choices all around be sure to check out Black Dog if you've lived in Champaign all your life and never tried it or if you are new to the area and are wondering if there are any good places to eat."}
{"text":"Um, I'm not quite sure how I haven't reviewed this place yet. I'm a BBQ junkie. I've had it all over the country, from the dry rub of Memphis to the vinegar based sauces of North Carolina to the beef ribs of Texas. I'm not an expert, but I do know what tastes good.

Black Dog tastes good.

I've had the burnt tips (in my opinion, the burnt ends of food are always the best) and the brisket, and both were succulent. A huge plus for me is that the food doesn't come drenched in sauce. That way you can actually taste the meat and the rub and get a true feel for the barbecue. I love the baked beans, mainly because they have little pieces of pork in them. The fries are nice and crispy, which I love. 

After coming from a hard workout, I was able to demolish the combo platter with a slightly too full feeling, so it's a lot of food. Normally I can't eat that much. I still haven't bought ribs, so that's the next thing to try.

Because of the hype around this place, the service is not always the best. It's small and a bit cramped as well. This is why it only gets 4 stars. I wonder if they'll have a patio this summer, because honestly I can think of nothing better than a plate of barbecue, warm weather, and cold beer."}
{"text":"This food at this place is amazing. The Yelp reviews definitely did not disappoint. I had the pineapple pepper margarita (x3), and a combo platter with brisket, catfish, greens, and twice baked potato casserole. The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the brisket was dry, but everything else I would order again. You can't go to this place and not have the twice baked potato casserole, though. I wish I had taken home a whole pan of that stuff. 

There was a long line when we got there, but since there were only 2 in our party, we were seated relatively quickly (about 30 minutes as opposed to an hour and 30 minutes).  They seat smaller parties first, instead of pushing tables together to accommodate larger parties (which was a plus for us!). Our waitress, Liz, was very helpful and relatable, plus she had great recommendations. It was obvious that she was really busy, but she always made sure to check in and see that everything was still good with us. The pulled pork was also really good. Everything on my plate was seasoned really well and the bbq sauces were a really nice touch (Texas & Georgia Peach). I was saying that I can only think of 1 other restaurant where everything I ordered was great (brisket here being the exception)...I highly recommend this place, I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a BBQ fanatic, and I give every place at least one shot at winning me over. Let's just say Black Dog will be seeing a lot more of me! Our waitress was very helpful, happy and gave us good tips on what was good (apparently everything, from what we tried. The ribs were great. Pulled pork was really good. 

The sauces were \"OK\", but I could see myself learning to like them more. I didn't notice much dry rub, but it's a good sign when ribs aren't drowned in sauce. I liked their french fries a lot and my wife loved the twice baked potato casserole. Can't comment on the drink selection or bar. Overall it's a tight space and has a hip vibe, being in a university town you expect that usually. 

The bartender with the TIGHT fro (respect) was energized and really brought an upbeat vibe to the post lunch hour rush. 

Overall Black Dog was really good, bordering on great, for Illinois BBQ places, and I've been to a lot. We'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"As someone from Texas who knows barbecue this place makes me roll my eyes. They run out of everything suitable. I actually order the fish or something vegetarian, so I do not have to swallow the charred badly seasoned food when I am dragged there. It is also way to crowded. I find the waitstaff very nice though, considering they are stuck in such a tiny hamster cage with so many people"}
{"text":"This is my all time favor BBQ joint ANYWHERE! The \"Famous BBQ\" in Dallas, TX isn't able to hold a candle to Black Dog! I love the burnt ends, pit beans, and corn bread!!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in CU! Some portions are not extremely large, but everything tastes great. Prices are extremely reasonable. Plan for at least a 30 minute wait around dinner time."}
{"text":"Try their ribs. They are SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDD. it's definitely the best rib in CU community."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's so crowded and can't even enjoy my food cause we got this extra table that's so high that we can see everybody. But I'll give it a try again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Champaign-Urbana. It's not just the sauce. They know how to cook the meat. I'm not sure I've had better beef brisket anywhere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq I've ever had.  I take day trips from chicago to go here."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue! Came early on a Monday evening and there was no wait at all. I had a triple combo platter with pulled pork, ribs, and burnt ends with sweet potato fries and cornbread. The pulled pork and ribs were delicious but those burnt ends were special. So melt-in-your-mouth delicious, would definitely recommend above anything. I got the Georgia peach barbecue sauce which was very pleasantly peachy. My sides were tasty, the sweet potato fries were crispy and the cornbread was good. No complaints really, service was very friendly as well. I can't wait to come back for more burnt ends and to try their other items.
UPDATE: Went back and had the special Sunday pork belly, more burnt ends, catfish, and coleslaw. Would absolutely recommend the pork belly if you're there on a Sunday, and the coleslaw was excellent! Catfish was good, and burnt ends were also still delish, even though they were a little inconsistent across the table. Some people's weren't as fatty as mine, but still a good trip to Black Dog. Will be back."}
{"text":"We are just passing through doing a college visit and stumbled across this joint.  Being from the DC area we expect a lot from our food.  This was spectacular!  One of the best BBQ places I have ever been to.  We went at 5:15 and got right in.  Quick service, brisket that melts in your mouth, chicken that doesn't need any sauce and sides to die for.  Don't miss this place if you are visiting UI!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, this establishment came highly recommended.  While pleased with the food,  I was very disappointed not to receive my entire order.  After being in class all day, I didn't really up to leaving my hotel room to go back to the restaurant to pick up the rest of my meal."}
{"text":"Great bbq, but its a shame that they dont have more seating.  Always a decent wait if you go during prime time.  Pulled pork sandwich is my favorite along with rib tips.  Certainly a must visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"Some friends were passing through town looking for a good, hearty meal and I instantly thought: Black Dog.

Everything was as excellent as it usually is. This time though, I tried the smoked polish sausage (grilled) with the hot mustard BBQ sauce. Folks, this was an unreal combination. GET IT!

Can't wait to try out the Champaign location when the inside opens!"}
{"text":"My family came down for homecoming and the new Black Dog location was a must-try.

The new restaurant is located in a weird spot, we wouldn't have found it if it weren't for the signs outside. It's basically in an old train station, but don't let that fool you, the inside is really nice. It's definitely not as cramped as the Urbana restaurant, but with the crowds that Black Dog regularly draws, there still was a considerable number of people just hanging out around the entrance and about a ~15 minute wait on a Saturday at ~4pm.

The food, I would say is the same. The Urbana location never fails to disappoint, and the new location similarly made for an excellent BBQ dinner that my family and I enjoyed. I tried the smoked salmon this time as a change of pace and it was delicious.

The service was good, it's great to see that BD is hiring servers of the same caliber at the new location. Ours was nice and handled our group of 5 quite well. There was a little mix up on the sides, my grandfather received my sides and I received his. Not a big deal at all.

Still probably the best place in town for BBQ, definitely like the new location and it's nice to see a local business expanding like this."}
{"text":"Black Dog is almost always perfect. They do a wonderful Carolina-style BBQ which focuses on vinegar, spice and smoke, not so much on sweetness. Everything I've ordered has been good, but my go-to is the 2-meat combo platter, which comes with 2 sides and is a great value for the amount of food you get (I always leave feeling stuffed, and I can eat a lot). If you're into catfish, try the catfish with mustard sauce; I never get tired of it. When they have them, the beef ribs are fantastic. There is a good variety of beers on tap, and the selection is constantly changing; there is usually something for everyone. I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few. 

As everyone has mentioned, lines can be long, but the wait is worth it, especially in the summer when it's not painful to stand outside. The only bad experience I've had with waitstaff was once when a friend was asked how his beer was and he said it wasn't what he expected and then got interrogated rather uncomfortably by the waiter about what he meant. Usually everyone is fairly pleasant, even when the restaurant is packed and hectic. As others have also mentioned, if you want burnt ends go early!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST BBQ I have ever had! Great little place to grab some lunch but sometimes you'll have to wait in line but the wait is TOTALLY worth it! Got the pulled pork sandwich with the BBQ beans and it was SOOOO GOOD! Go -you will NOT regret it!"}
{"text":"There is lots to love here, but also lots that is just average.  The building is awesome.  Right in downtown Urbana.  A long wood bar with booths along the perimeter.  Tiled floors, and a great worn in pub feel.  The service is friendly and they know the menu.  Food and beer come out relatively quickly.

The beer selection is nice.  About 8 rotating taps of quality micros from around the nation and some Belgians as well.  They also have a rotating cask which is great.  Plenty of bottles as well.  I enjoyed Summit Oatmeal Stout on cask.

All fine and good, but the food left something to be desired for me.  I wanted the burnt ends sandwich.  They were out, that is not a problem at all.  It is great that they can go through the good stuff like that.  I ended up with a half rack of pork spare ribs.  The ribs are very good.  I did enjoy them, but not great.  I do not like the BBQ sauce at all.  it is like a tomato paste, almost marinara like.  The sides are crap though.  Mac and cheese seemed like it was sitting out forever.  Similar to old mac and cheese that has been sitting out and hardened for hours after Christmas diner.  The slaw seemed almost rancid.  I could not eat it.  Luckily I did not get a sandwich that would have been covered in it.

Overall, I really wanted to love this place.  The meat is very good though not great, and got to love the beer selection.  As well as a very nice Bourbon selection.  Though overall, I think the reviews here are a bit of a home town bias.  I will continue to support these guys, but not up to the hype I had been expecting."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at the new Black Dog.  A fantastic build out in the old train depot downtown.  Inside is narrow with all wood and a few TV's.  The bar runs almost the entire length inside, so plenty of seats there with a few booths and high top tables.  High ceilings and windows all around as well, which makes the place feel a little more open than the narrow area suggests.  Love the atmosphere.

I showed up about 11:15 am, and there was plenty of seats available.  Though that filled up quickly.  Sitting at the bar, I had no issues with the service.  Food came out before I knew it, and piping hot.  The bartender also new the beer list and we talked a bit about the cask offerings.  This and the Urbana location might be the only place in the area that does cask now.  Which is a shame.  

Anyway, ordered the burnt ends sandwich.  Topped with coleslaw and the Carolina Red vinegar based sauce.  I am not a huge fan of coleslaw by itself, but put it on a sandwich and that makes all the difference.  The sauce had the perfect vinegary kick, and the burnt ends are just damn good.  Along with a side of pit beans that were hot, smoky, and sweet.  The burnt ends sell out pretty much everyday.  However, they are always ready at opening, and again at 5pm.

10 taps, with two cask offerings (as I said above).  I don't know if I have ever seen North Coast Red Seal on cask, and it was in good condition.  With the rest of the tap selection running from Founders to The Bruery.  Along with Blind Pig, one of the better beer bars in the area. 

I have always thought the Urbana location was very good, if not excellent, though maybe a little overrated.  Though the burnt ends are very much on point here.  A great beer bar and really good BBQ place in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Black Dog clearly does bbq right. Exceptional food and a good beer selection.  It took unnecessarily long to be seated and our party of two went to the bar to avoid the  wait for a table or booth but the host rudely told us we had to wait for spots at the bar.  We waited for all the parties in front of us to be seated in booths and tables while those two spots at the bar remained vacant.  After 25 minutes we were finally seated in the exact vacant seats we tried to occupy 25 minutes before.  The hosts micro-manages the entire place and makes the seating and thus service inefficient.  It was like a slap in the face to be later seated in the exact spots we tried to occupy.  Its a very small establishment that needs to be run more efficiently to turn tables and keep customers waiting times down.  The host didn't tell us how long our wait would be  and wouldn't even give us an estimate.  Get your food to go, that is if they have what you want.  They seem to run out of a lot of food items.  If you don't mind a unnecessary wait, even if they run out of your top choice in meat, the food is consistently very good."}
{"text":"FINALLY returned and tried that burnt ends sandwich all the young people are talking about!  I loved it, and I'm not even a brisket person.  Very tender with just the right amount of crunch!  It was actually kind of miraculous that they hadn't run out, since I ordered them at 6:30 on a busy Friday night!  Fortune was smiling upon me, I guess.

Our table also split the cornbread as an appetizer, which was just a little bit spicy (and meaty, of course).  Will other restaurants please jump on the savory cornbread train?  I am straight-up tired of eating over-sweetened cornbread that tastes more like cake.  Ugh.  My boyfriend and I split a beer flight, which is a fantastic deal: you are getting essentially 24 oz of beer for just $6.  And the little glasses all came out on a large wooden plate shaped like a dog bone!  Too adorable.

The one not-so-good thing about our meal was the corn on the cob - it was mushy and flavorless and got stuck in our teeth!  I know this is a little early for corn season, but shit, we ARE in the middle of Illinois - you'd think they could get corn right!  Just stick with another side dish and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"BBQ great, sides great, beer selection great.  Some of the staff can be a bit troubled to have to wait on you since they know you're going to wait for it anyway. I like the cornbread appetizer since there's meat in it and there daily specials good."}
{"text":"Love the burnt-ends and I get it every time! I would go early for lunch/dinner unless you're willing to sit by the bars (which isn't that bad if it's just 2 people). The space is on the smaller side, and they are popular so it fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"On our trip back to Rockford we stopped here in Champaign, Illinois for dinner. This restaurant is amazing. We started off with an appetizer. the Barbecue Nachos with pulled pork and cheddar cheese. Delicious. It had baked beans, barbecue sauce pulled pork and cheddar cheese. The side sauce was delightful but I can't remember what it was called. The side mac was great as well. Hubby loved his Carolina Burger and their fries were on point. Great service and brew house ambiance."}
{"text":"Best bbq ever!! If your smart you'll wait till after lunch rush hits to try it, unless you don't mind waiting, super small place so limited seating!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I love black dog and aside from maize it is my most frequently visited restaurant. I will not speak at length about the food. The meats and sauces are amazing. The sides are fine. Two underrated menu items that you must try are the rib tips (best value for your dollar) and the mustard sauce (although you can't go wrong with any sauce). 

Now my beef :/ with the new location, service. At the Urbana location service was always top notch. The staff was friendly and knowledgable.  At the new location, the friendliness is there but knowledge has been replaced with rushing you through your meal. I, like many previous reviewers, despise the iPad approach. It's awkward for ordering and especially awkward for tipping. The staff doesn't have the same knowledge/passion as before. We overhead a server saying that she couldn't recommend a beer (at a place that has a great beer selection) because she is more of a vodka girl. Maybe go work at Olive Garden? Yikes. 

Another unrelated gripe. In the winter they have ceiling radiators that feel good when you walk in but if seated underneath may cause you to sweat through your meal. 

Overall: great food, lackluster service."}
{"text":"I am just yelping to add that their baked sweet potatoes are great. They are baked in the wood smoke oven and when you reheat them the next day, you want to go back to the Black Dog as soon as you can.

The place is as good as its high rating, and is a remarkable value for the price."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, when you hear \"black dog,\" you usually associate it with something completely different than a smokehouse that churns out delicious barbecue. Well... maybe it's not so different! But, that's neither here nor there.

 The black dog in question here is Black Dog Smoke & Ale House, and they really do churn out mouth-wateringly good bbq on the daily. While visiting family in Champagne/Urbana, I was lucky enough to be treated to lunch from Black Dog, and boy did it make 22 degree weather in March that much more bearable (keep in mind, I'm a Hawaiian beach bum, so that's frigid and also very impressive). 

As soon as we arrived, I could tell that the place had to be amazing, simply based off of the fact that the line was basically out the door, well past noon. I honestly didn't even attempt to go inside because of how packed it was, and it was pretty cold out. Unfortunately, I can't speak on the service or interior of the restaurant, but it looks pretty nice and the service can't be bad with that many people being effectively moved in and out at all times.

Finally, after driving back to the house and suffering torture by way of hot bbq in my lap, I got to dig into some good 'ol beef ribs. They were 100% worth the wait. I may not get to have real barbecue like that often, but think I can be pretty confident in saying that it was damn good. The meat was cooked to perfection and it absolutely fell off of the bone. I specifically remember going to take a piece and ending up with the bone in my hand and the meat still left on the plate. The stuff was tender. Along with that, it was perfectly flavored. There was just enough sauce on them that I got the additional flavor, but just little enough that I was still able to enjoy the naturally amazing flavor of the meat itself. It was amazing and I am legitimately saddened that I'm not able to eat here on at least a weekly basis.

Long story short: if you ever have an opportunity to try Black Dog Smoke & Ale house, absolutely do it. The line is always worth it."}
{"text":"Great burnt ends!  Went with the Blackdog Burger, nice alternative if you've had their excellent pork shoulder and brisket."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Not impressed either time. Very expensive for the little food you get and the quality. Nothing special. Didn't finish my meal the first time just because the flavor wasn't there. Bland. My second trip was just for a to-go order of burnt ends. Waited 20+ min for 3 small, mostly fat pieces, and paid $7. Definitely have had better."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: the cuisine is really great--entrees, appetizers, and drinks all are 4-5 star foods. I would recommend the the corn bread (it has bits of BBQ pork in it) to start, the chicken sandwich for an entree (its free range and you can tell the difference) and whatever beer is on the \"nitro tap\" (it makes the beer really creamy).

THE BAD: customer service is very poor. in order to be seated all of your party must be present. I was hassled because 5 out of 6 of us where there. I understand if 1 person is holding a table down for 6 but 5/6? C'mon. Also, servers have been cold, short, and gruff with my tables. On the whole, the staff comes off very pretentious.

HOW TO FIX: right now you are walk in, consider a reservation system; expand your seating area/kitchen to accommodate more customers; ask your staff to be friendly (not many of them smile, honestly!) and understanding (especially in situations like the ones I described); try and give off the vibe that you appreciate our town in which you have been so successful.

STAY or GO: I wouldn't pick Black Dog for a meal but I would go if someone else wanted to."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times and the food is good.  Its a little cramped when it gets busy but that is a good thing."}
{"text":"Being from texas was excited to see something texan-ish in urbana.. i love the place.. for a sunday evening in summer where urbana is pretty quiet, this place was surprisingly busy... the decor reminded me of austin! food was pretty good too..was it the best brisket i ve ever had? maybe not but its still quite good. Also had their buffalo wings which were really good.."}
{"text":"Burnt ends are to die for! Love their spicy sauces. Definitely the best barbecue I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I used to live near this place and every time when  I drive  pass by  it , it's always full of people waiting in line. So, when my parents visited me this time. I took them to this place. They both loved the food and the drinks here. My dad loves to drink and he told me this place is one the best pubs he has been to. I personally love the BBQ ribs, it is the best one I ever had. One thing worth mention is you gotta wait in line for awhile before you can be seated."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. the atmosphere is nice and the food is really good, possibly the best in town. Is it the best BBQ I've ever had in my life and justifies waiting 2 hours in line to only be told half the menu has been sold out?  Maybe not, but ordering for pick up is perfectly reasonable and an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Yea, I feel dumb writing the 99th review... as if what I say about Black Dog will be more relevant or informative than the 98 before me... but might I say anyway:

I live in Los Angeles, I'm here for the summer.  Not that LA is known for bbq, but neither is East Central Illinois, so I'll continue.  STILL, I eat at a barbecue/beer joint every week, more than once a week in Los Angeles and BLACK DOG makes me feel embarrassed that I spend $20 on a pulled pork sandwich, a beer and a tip at Blues BBQ in West Hollywood.  6.95 for a burnt tips or ends or whatever sandwich AND a side [I had potato salad and dipped those spuds into every one of my sauce flight sauces].    And like $4 for a glass of what our AWESOME, nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter    waiter called a REALLY nice PBR.  

I got there at 11:00 and watched the place fill up to the point where we had to use a back exit to get a baby in a stroller and a 4-year-old out of the restaurant.  But they HAD A BACK DOOR and they let us use it which made us feel cool and made them look cool for being accommodating.  It probably wasn't even a secret door, but we felt grateful all the same.  

The vegetarian 4-year-old happily ate an awesome looking provolone grilled sandwich, so Imma just put that out there in case your vegetarian self gets pulled along to Black Dog.  

Nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter sampled us beer, gave me an extra sauce when I decided which one from my flight was the best [I liked Georgia Peach] and was really attentive despite a full-house at 11:30 a.m. 

I got out of there full-to-the-brim and more satisfied than I've been in awhile [good bbq paired with beer is a wonderful lover] for less than $12 [excluding the big ol' tip he deserved].  Why is CU so great??  

If someone wanted the short version of what my BBQ at Black Dog experience was, I would yell:  \"LEGIT AS HELL.\" and hope that summed up the flava', waiter and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay, so we read reviews of this joint rating the BBQ excellent, best ever, I died and went to heaven, ranked #2 in the US by Fox-something for BBQ and decided to venture off our course from St. Louis to Indy to visit Urbana IL and this incredible place to eat. Correctly reviewed, there was a wait at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening. We signed in on the board as soon as we arrived (again, thanks to a review) - good to know this or we would have been standing around outside in the brisk weather until we happened to figure it out. We waited about a half hour and were seated at the bar. Service was okay, not stellar. So we ordered the \"burnt ends\". I'm not sure what we should have expected, but two fatty slices of brisket were not to my liking. If you like fatty prime rib, then you will be in heaven. The rib tips had a good flavor, were a bit on the tough side for me, hubby enjoys chewing so he didn't mind them. The sauces were just okay, hubby didn't like any we tried and we were charged extra for each sauce. The cornbread was good. Overall, this a good BBQ place, not the best we have eaten, not the worst we have eaten. Not a place for cheap beer - one draft cost $6.00.  We have a much better BBQ join in Indianapolis - if you ever drive thru, try Squealers."}
{"text":"This place takes to long to get a seat. The old ass door guy is rude. Burnt ends are old ass meats and don't taste good here, everybody seems to love their old ass meats though. I'm not sure whats up with the little boutique restaurants around this town. People want to eat and not wait 45 minutes for a damn seat!"}
{"text":"Wow, that was some good eatin'! Came here for lunch. My wife had the smoked chicken salad sandwich. The smoked chicken was a nice twist for chicken salad. I had a sandwich whose name escapes me now, (and it isn't on the online menu) but which was a grilled Polish sausage, topped with pulled pork, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce. (I went with the medium hot Carolina Red.)  Very, VERY delicious! We both got fries with our sandwiches. Their standard fries are the thin battered variety, and were clearly freshly made, not over-salted, and not too greasy."}
{"text":"Would not come back. The food wasn't terrible, but nothing great. The hostess was grumpy, but the waitress was fine. The beef ribs were the best (they were out of pork) and very generous. The chicken was pretty good and the brisket was a little bland and dry, but had a good dry rub taste. The pulled pork tasted like grease and the rib tips were flavorless. The succotash was disappointing, as were the baked beans and coleslaw. The green beans were decent, but nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"Wow. I was raised on Kansas City BBQ and have lived down south in two different states. I moved to CU skeptical of Illinois barbecue. (I lived in Michigan for awhile, and what they serve is the most heinous excuse for BBQ I've come across. Obviously Illinois ain't BBQ stupid like that state north and east of us on the other side of Lake Michigan.)

Damn, has Black Dog has got it going on! We're talkin the real deal KC style burnt ends. The pulled pork is the meatier Georgia style, and better than any I ever had in Tennessee. The mustard based sauce was authentically Carolina. I swear, the Carolina Red was the best sauce I've had outside of Kansas City. The sauce is actually reminiscent of Gates (Hi! May I help you?!) in Kansas City more than any other sauce I've ever had. The pit beans were real pit beans. (Never got anything comparable in Tennessee.) And the burnt ends were moist, smokey, and delicious. 

Southern transplants, you best git yo asses down there quick, y'all. Hell, all y'all need to git yo asses down there quick, so long as you save me a spot in line. I guarantee you'll slap your momma and ask her why she can't cook like that! 

Can I give six stars, cause damn, they're worth it! And I haven't even mentioned the draught beer selection!"}
{"text":"After having dined at the Urbana location many times over the past 2.5 years, I can say I'm loving the new location. All of the best parts about the Urbana location without the cramped quarters and lack of parking!

I was raised on Kansas City BBQ and have lived down south in two different states. I moved to CU skeptical of Illinois barbecue.

Excellent BBQ was the last thing in the world I thought I'd find here. 

Black Dog is the real deal. 

They have the KC style burnt ends. The pulled pork is the meatier Georgia style, and better than any I ever had in Tennessee. The mustard based sauce was authentically Carolina. I swear, the Carolina Red was the best sauce I've had outside of Kansas City. The sauce is actually reminiscent of Gates (Hi! May I help you?!) in Kansas City more than any other sauce I've ever had. The pit beans were real pit beans. (Never got anything comparable in Tennessee.) And the burnt ends were moist, smokey, and delicious. 

The best part is that the new location has none of the heavy wait in the undersized restaurant feel. There is plenty of space, the food is just as good, and the decor is fabulous! This is an excellent restaurant upgrade."}
{"text":"Food's great, wonderful beer selection.  Can't say enough good about the barbecue here.  Truly awesome - one of the best little things about Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have ever had. I can't believe I am saying this about a BBQ place in central Illinois, but I am. There were five of us and our food varied from pulled pork, pork ribs, burnt ends, brisket, and beef ribs. We all got different sauces, which you get to customize, so we can try as much as possible. 

The meat melted in your mouth. Every bit of it. The corn bread had bacon and bits of meat in it. It was amazing. The taste was intense. They also have an awesome selection of craft beers and the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. If you are by UofI you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"It is a heaven on the earth for me - a carnivore. I wish they have enough burnt ends since they are the best. I only got lucky once so far and will come visit again and again :)"}
{"text":"Was excited to dine here because of the reviews, but the experience was more meh. We had the tips, chicken, and pork. Since chicken is usually not the star of a meat platter, it's weird that the chicken was the best tasting. Impossibly small sides for the price point. I'd be happier to pay a bit more and get a fairly sized side. Service was lackluster. 

Sauces were okay. 

Left feeling somewhat satisfied that there was food in my belly, but a disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"Hands DOWN BEST bbq EVA!!!!!! I would stand on hit coals to get a plate!!! You won't regret it..."}
{"text":"Talk about a surprise. Came by while traveling for work due to a friend's suggestion. I stopped by every Sunday and Friday for 6 weeks during my travels!

Little shotgun building. The staff was super friendly and the BBQ was top notch. The peach BBQ sauce was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"There are not enough words to describe how amazing this food is. I went to school here and just thought this is what good barbecue tastes like. Now that I have moved away, it has ruined me forever on bbq. I can't eat anywhere else because I always compare it to black dog and always end up being disappointed :( oh how I miss you black dog. To anyone in the area, go here immediately. The wait is long but the food is unbelievably good."}
{"text":"The smoked meat was fantastic.  Sweet potato fries, awesome, georgia peach bbq sauce...outstanding.  Great find..and Corey was great!"}
{"text":"It's OK - decent barbecue, but they're always sold out of stuff. I don't see what the big deal is!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer selection. Usually a wait and often run out of certain things. Wish i could eat here every day! The sauces are all kind of the same to me."}
{"text":"Black Dog is very very good. Really. But the hype is getting crazy.
I don't know that it's necessarily worth the normal wait time for a table. But, get it to go and you won't be disappointed. Go on Thursdays - the mac and cheese and the smoked duck (white or dark meat - can't miss) are amazing.
Excellent selection of bourbons too, and the flight samplers are a good time."}
{"text":"When the top 3rd thing to do in Champaign is visit the library according to trip advisor I began to worry. Then I found the Black Dog and wOw. I'm not a BBQ fan for the most part but the flavor in the \"burnt ends\" sandwich was indescribable. As I sit here finishing my Green Flash IPA I'm tempted to order again. I walked in here at 1115a thinking I'd be the only one here only to find I got the last seat at the bar. Soon after I looked over my right shoulder and there's an ever growing mob of people that looked starved and impatient. Not much seating and peeling paint worn out checkered floors give this place a certain feeling like you found something off the beaten path that's special to you and you can't wait to tell your tribe about it. I see one award dangling crookedly dead center of the bar that's partially covered by liquor bottles that reads \"Best of CU ... WINNER\" but the wall should be covered in awards for the succulent deliciousness.  If you're here, you need to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing on about 15 different levels. You literally can order anything on the menu, and it will be amazing. Obligatory praise due for the burnt ends (smokier, juicier cap of the brisket, with a crispy, burnt edge), pulled pork, and brisket. 

Of course, that's leaving out any one of the awesome burgers, the half chicken,ribs, and their awesome sides (pit beans or sweet potato fries for me...but regular fries, southwestern potato salad, twice baked casserole, and smoked sweet potato w/ brown sugar and butter...all ridiculously awesome).

The red cabbage cole slaw, and any number of their homemade sauces (my favorite being the hot georgia peach) are outstanding compliments to the meat. 

and they're conscientious too. a few small price hikes to support grass fed, local beef, and the delightful free-range chicken. they even recycle, which I assure you most of the restaurants in town do not. 

Oh, and don't glaze over when you hear the specials. Burritos for lunch are insane, and don't get me started on the beef ribs. Slightly more labor intensive than the pork ribs (at risk of being redundant, also excellent), but a serious treat. 

Almost forgot to mention their amazing beverage selection. Not only is their beer selection fantastic (with the option for an affordable flight of craft beers), they have 1) an awesome whiskey selection 2) awesome bottled soft drinks...mexican coke and squirt (with sugar, not corn syrup), and a couple other tasty options. 

Alright, this post is getting annoyingly long. But this place is just too good. They deliver you an amazing product while being environmentally conscientious, and just overall nice guys. 


Lastly, I also might clarify a couple things that people have commented on, but are inaccurate.

The platter vs. the sandwich
platter is twice the meat of a sandwich (in the case of brisket, pork, or ends), with two sides, and no bun. so it's not \"basically the same thing,\" it's twice as much of everything, without a bun.

the beans don't come out of a microwave, they are smoked and then kept in a hotbox, which is very much not a microwave. plastic might still melt, but it didn't happen in a microwave.

 
That is all."}
{"text":"Apparently, this is the go-to place for BBQ in Champaign and it also has a great beer selection! The restaurant is quite big and has a cabin like feel to it.

I got a combo of baby back ribs and chicken. It comes with 2 sides which I opted for mac&cheese and baked sweet potato. The ribs were sub-par. There was barely any meat on them and not very tender. The ribs seemed like they were a couple days old and they reheated it or something. On the other hand, the chicken was great! It was moist, flavorful, fell right off the bone. So weird that they got the chicken right but the ribs were ehhhh... I love how they have a variety of sauces to choose from! They all have different spiciness levels to them.

My bf ordered the Texas burger because they ran out of beef ribs. It comes with a beef patty with brisket. He loved the brisket inside the burger!

My gripe about this place was the service. After our meal, we were charged for an extra dish that we didn't order. We didn't notice until after we paid. Our waitress would only refund us back that dish but didn't recalculate the tip and tax so ended up paying more than we should have anyways! She was too lazy to re-input our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but there were literally only two tables left in the restaurant...
Anyways, the food was alright, I've tasted better in Cali!"}
{"text":"Lovely place! Great values and great food!

Love their burnt ends and beef ribs. If you cannot decide, burnt end is always a good choice."}
{"text":"There are only two things to know here: location and flavor.

For this being Champaign and delicious, name one other local bbq place that can top it. Even if you were in Chicago, not many places could even beat the flavor of this smoked meat. 

If you're in the area and like BBQ, then definitely come here (recommend Chipotle sauce)."}
{"text":"Might be the best BBQ joint in the Central Illinois area.

Having relocated to Kansas City, the BBQ capital of the nation, and eating Oklahoma Joe's on a regular basis, Black Dogs would be a HUGE competitor in the KC area. It's a close 2 or 3 in my BBQ book (OK Joe's being number 1). For just being in a college town, I wish this restaurant got more publicity because their recipe is ROCK solid. I miss it every time I'm thinking of visiting my Alma Mater.

Their ribs and burnt ends are my favorite. I like my meat fatty, and these meats are marbled well, and smoked well. The corn bread is also phenomenal. It's pretty big (I usually split with one other person). Lastly the sauce: everyone I've tried is true to its name. Try Carolina Red for a kick or Georgia Peach for some sweet sauce."}
{"text":"If you've never been here, upon arriving, write your name and the number of people in your party on the board or you will be waiting even longer. This place is almost always busy, and if you get to sit down in less than 10 minutes, count yourself lucky (I've waited over 30 minutes before).

Just a heads-up: don't go here to just have a beer; while the name includes ale house, they will refuse to pour you a pint if you aren't dining there. This was rather unexpected for an ale house...or anywhere, for that matter. 

Beyond that, the service is excellent, the food is pretty good, and the beer selection is better than most. I think they have 8-12 taps and always have great craft brews."}
{"text":"Must eat BBQ, I would rank it with #marksfeedstore in Louisville Ky. They were out of turkey & burnt ends"}
{"text":"1st time @ new location. Great atmosphere. Holds twice what original place does. 1st time been able to get burnt ends @ any BBQ restaurant. (Normally out).
Maybe one of the Best BBQ places I've ever been in."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of hype! I eat there every so often, but I still have not found a BBQ sauce that I particularly like. Nevertheless, the BBQ is so good I eat it without!

Baked Potato Casserole is my favorite side, usually get two of them. 

Be prepared to wait and make sure your whole party is there otherwise they won't seat you. 

Great whiskey flights, good service."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful BBQ.  Everything is amazing and it would be impossible to go wrong with their food selection.  The biggest problem is that they are a victim of their own success and lines can be incredibly long, items run out, and the place is often crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"What could make Black Dog better? Not having to wait in line! Now that they've opened the second location, you can walk in during off hours and expect empty tables! We've come here around 7 expecting a huge line and there was only a few other groups! We had the entire restaurant to ourselves! You can even walk in during the lunch and dinner rush and it's unlikely that you'll have to wait long. It's still the same old great Black Dog food but now you don't have to wait an eternity or relegate yourself to take out!"}
{"text":"What else is there to say? When I finally had a chance to sit down at the new Champaign location a couple weeks back, the quality of the food and the experience lived up to the Urbana location. I like that the new bar that doesn't have that annoying ledge so I can more comfortably enjoy my food. The food is just as amazing and the quality of service is just as good as the original. What I love about Black Dog is that they keep their prices affordable by embracing ways to cut costs by increasing the efficiency of operations - and never compromise on the quality of the food. They were pioneers at the Urbana location when they started having customers sign themselves in on a pad of paper. At the new location, there is a tablet where you sign yourself in. You enter your phone number and you'll be notified when your spot is ready. If you download the app they use to reserve a spot in line, you can even see your spot advancing to the front of the line meaning you can head down the street and grab a drink comfortably knowing when to return."}
{"text":"Black Dog you are the top dog!  

We came here after a game and fell on the food like hungry little puppies.  I had a ribs and burnt ends both of which were fabulous.  I also adored the twice baked potato casserole which I learned about from other Yelp reviews.  They even made another batch for us, how terrific!

My only issue is that it is always crowded.  So I suggest that you double the size of the place or keep a table that is always available just for me.  Thanks!"}

{"text":"I had the chance to try Black Dog in person last weekend and my previous rating holds. Actually, I'm going to officially drop my rating from 3.5 to 2.5 stars.

I went all out and tried the 3-meat platter (don't be alarmed folks, I shared this with a friend!!) with pork ribs, burnt ends, and pork belly. The burnt ends were decent, tender but not so juicy and lacking a lot of smokey flavor. The pork belly was mediocre; I personally prefer this fatty cut to be a little more seared but this one had a mushy, almost creamy texture due to the high fat content - not really my thing, but may be more appealing to those who dig fat more than I do. Again, though, I wasn't too impressed with the flavor and I almost found it bland. The ribs were unfortunately a mess. They were tough, chewy, and completely stuck to the bone - I had difficulty getting off all the meat! Moreover, they were quite flavorless and there was no smoke ring at all. Being a ribs gal, I was very disappointed.

We tried the beans and cornbread. I actually really enjoyed the beans, they had nice meaty flavor and had a nice al dente bite to them unlike the mush you get at most places. The cornbread was good, but a little on the greasy and dense side (I prefer mine fluffier and sweeter). The BBQ sauce is probably Black Dog's biggest strength. They offer a large variety, ranging from mild to very spicy (think habanero). Both the mild and hot peach sauces are tasty (though I didn't find the hot one to actually be that spicy). The medium flavored mustard sauce is definitely a winner! Very rich and complex.

They run out of meat pretty quickly at peak times. We tried to come around 7pm on a Saturday and they were out of ribs, burnt ends, turkey, and something else.

Also, note that the portion sizes are actually not that big. Our 3-meat platter came with 3 ribs, 3 pieces of burnt ends, and 3 pieces of pork belly. This was perfectly fine to split between my friend and I, but if you are more carnivorous than us just keep that in mind.

One final heads up: if you opt for an email receipt, you will see a bill for your whole party regardless of whether or not you split the check. Not sure why this has to be the case, but it's confusing.

Ok, I feel like I've ragged on Black Dog a lot. I admit part of this due to the fact that I'm coming from KC and have higher standards. But, there's really no excuse for lack of flavor when it comes to BBQ. 2.5 stars for the meat but I'll round up for the beans and sauces. But let's be honest, who comes to a BBQ restaurant for the sides...?"}
{"text":"You get fat and happy just smelling the place from a block away!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It is delicious! Make sure to come here early though because the lines are long and they will only seat your party is complete.

We ordered the ribs with the peach sauce. The ribs were yummie but were not fall off the bone type.  Despite this, the meat was still very tender. With the ribs came two sides. I opted for the spicy potato salad and the sweet potato fries. I liked both the sides but I think I enjoyed the spicy potato salad more.

The corn bread is its own beast.  It is OUTSTANDING. It is definitely corn bread you probably have never tasted anywhere else. They put moist sweet pork meat in it!!!! What a wonderful surprise. I could eat a bunch of it up!

Overall food was good, service was good, and our food came out fast. A great experience! Looking forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue in town but if you intend on eating their get there early or you will stand in line that's how good it is or wait till little later but they might be sold out of some of the better items top-notch for barbecue"}
{"text":"Oh my GOODNESS! The best wings and barbecue I have EVER had! The coleslaw was on point and gave a cool refreshing crunch to counter the smoky hotness of the barbecue sauce. I would eat here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"The location is small but we were assured by other customers that the wait would be worth it. We arrived at 12:30, wrote our name on the dry erase board and had to stand in a small area between the door and diners. We were seated in a reasonable time, however and ordered a platter to split with my companion. The beef brisket was excellent--tender and oh-so-flavorful. I sampled the Carolina vinegar sauce, but my favorite was combining the Georgia peach and Texas sauces on the brisket. We liked the Pit beans and the corn muffin was amazing with a smokey bacon flavor. The slaw was ok. The food order came quickly, and the portions were generous, too. Not much atmosphere, but if you like quality BBQ, you will find it here!"}
{"text":"Love the ribs and sweet potato fries. Long wait sometimes but worth. Loved the vibe, there is always people in the place. The staff and service is good! 

If you're in a hurry, I wouldn't really recommend it because it's rare to get a seat immediately."}
{"text":"Quick service, fantastic burnt ends, knowledgeable staff, good cider.  Plus it is in an old train station and the prices are very reasonable! Would definitely return here."}
{"text":"Monday lunch @ 12:30 wasn't too crowded; large menu with a good selection; sides like sweet potato fries; spicy potato salad were both good;  great sandwiches at reasonable price; very good beer selection and offer a beer flight of current on tap; look forward to an evening meal to try the entree menu."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the city, hands down! Be prepared to wait a little while to be seated (it's that GOOD) but worth the wait! The servers were very helpful and knowledgable & I enjoyed the atmosphered. The pulled pork was DELICIOUS, upset I was not able to try the burnt ends due to them being sold out - as they were highly recommended. Overall, it was a great date with my fiancé and we are HIGHLY anticipating our return!"}
{"text":"This place was good even if you have to wait. I ordered the beef brisket with georgia peach sauce it was tasty. I had the spicy potato salad, though the side was small it was homely and unique in that it was homemade. Also, I recommend getting the sauce platter unless you know for sure your sauce for bbq. It is just easier for you to pick and your know if the placr is any good. Also the waiter was nice filled our glasses on a regular basis.  He also made sure everybody seating had enough space to eat comfortably because its a small place. Will go back again for sure"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting on the Power Tour so it was super busy. I like the check in system - come in and write your own name next on the poster. Only ended up waiting 10 minutes, if that. Was able to grab a drink from the bar while waiting, and as soon as we got that a spot opened up at the bar for us. We enjoyed the burnt ends appetizer and thankfully we got it right away because they were out of burnt ends shortly after. My husband and I each sampled a variety of tacos. I had pork belly (on special that night), brisket and chicken and my husband had the same except pulled pork instead of chicken. They are all simply dressed with onion and cilantro, and were all sooo good! I had the twice baked potato casserole for a side and my husband had the cornbread. Everything we tasted we liked a lot. 

What impressed us the most about this place was the staff and service. As I mentioned we were there with the Hot Rod Power Tour, which brings very large crowds, so it was very busy that night and our server also mentioned that they were short-staffed on top of it. We could not believe how hard every single server, food-runner and bus person was working to keep a good flow; they were hustling non-stop. This was definitely one of the hardest working staff we've seen at a restaurant in a while... well done!

For anyone planning a visit I would suggest an early  dinner to avoid menu items running out; we watched it happen twice while we were there. 

Overall a great experience - food was good and service was great. The old train station is a really cool building! We will definitely be returning the next time we visit the area."}
{"text":"Really great food with friendly and relaxed yet professional service.  Order anything on the menu and you'll be happy.  There's often a wait but that's because everyone wants their delicious BBQ and great alcohol selection. Trust me, the wait is always worth it."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is an enigma wrapped in a mystery.  The thermostat is currently at 83 degrees but nobody wants to address it.   There is no music or ambiance but this place could/should kill it.  The service in fantastically bad but the food is pretty decent.    I'm at a loss for words.   Lastly, the iPad checkout system is the worst thing to happen to America since ISIS.   After 3 hours of terrible service, please don't audit my gratuity as if I'm the bad guy.  

I HATE when people only mention the service portion of their experience on Yelp reviews, but this joint deserves it.    The constant updates on how may pork belly's remain in the kitchen could be \"86'd\" to make this a better experience.  It's as if every time an announcement came from the kitchen, each staff member smiled with the thought that they could leave this sweat box 10 minutes sooner."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you like BBQ, make sure you check out Black Dog.

Burnt Ends are amazing, if they have them available make sure you get some. =)

Really neat atmosphere, the staff are attentive and fun, and they have a fabulous selection of beer and other etoh."}
{"text":"Perfect. The BBQ sauce is on the side. And, you can choose different types of sauce. The excellent cornbread comes at the same time as the meal (I like it both in advance and with the meal) and has jalapinos in it. The ambiance is collegiate, but a parent feels comfortable here. The brisket was perfectly tender and moist. The pulled pork was light (not greasy). 
The waiter was light hearted and made the evening even more enjoyable. The crowd was having a good time.
I especially liked that they offered samples when deciding between two unknown beers. Hope to get the opportunity to eat here again."}
{"text":"I was not that pleased with this restaurant. I am from the south so I know I can't critique everyone to such high standards but I looked up a good bbq place in CU and this popped up. I treated my mother in law with burnt ends and pulled pork. The portion sizes were definitely smaller than what I thought they would be especially for how long I had to wait (about 45 minutes). My mother in law wanted their Texas sauce but they ran out about 20 minutes after placing my order so she was stuck with spicy Carolina red. Could just be me and I could be biased but it definitely didn't taste the best at all. On the plus side there was a line out the door so I guess it could just be me but if your from the south like me you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not from town, but travel to Champaign/ Urbana somewhat regularly.  Small but friendly place, has it's own parking.  beer and whiskey selections are nice.  had beef ribs special with mac & cheese and green beans,  Excellent meal.  Ate at the bar, bartender Amy gave great service and suggestions"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. I'm insanely thankful for this place, because now when my parents come to town, my brother can suggest a BBQ place that isn't Famous Dave's. 

Burnt ends = heaven on a sandwich. I got the cole slaw and sauce on the side so I could enjoy the smoky meat on its own with the occasional dip into the bbq sauce... The fries were nothing special, but also good dipped in bbq. 

The place is a little small and cramped, but that's part of the charm, and you just know a place is going to be good when you walk into a packed restaurant.

Minus one star because we sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before a waitress came by and said \"Oh, did you need menus?\""}
{"text":"Stopped here as part of a drive from Baltimore to Mt. Rushmore.  Was super psyched for the fare but alas - the goods did not live up to the hype.  This was pretty average stuff from top top bottom.  Burnt ends weren't really burnt ends but rather full slices of meat, so there was little char on the pieces.  Rib ends sounded great but were really bland.  Pulled pork was good yet nothing special.  Everything needed basic seasoning and the sauces we tasted were neither tangy or spicy as advertised.

One saving grace was the twice baked potato side, which was really good.  That wasn't enough to save Black Dog from being anything more than just OK."}
{"text":"They recommended the burnt ends sandwich and I was not disappointed.  Great flavors at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place except that it gets crowded during meal times, so get there early (dinner~ 5?) I love their  meat! It's like eating the most you can get out of a meat; good quality. And I'd recommend this location more than the one in urbana :)"}
{"text":"I'm learning that it's unfair to compare BBQ joints to Smoque and Lem's. That being said Black Dog is on par with County Line BBQ. I tried a little bit of everything. Only the cornbread & the smoked wings stood out as exceptional. Wings were cooked perfectly tender and had a nice spice rub.  The ribs were just ok. Fairly tender, but didn't live up to the hype. The brisket was terrible. Dry, bland definitely not tender. Pulled pork was also dry and flavorless. I'll probably stop by again, but only for the wings."}
{"text":"Cool little place...the pork was amazing and close to what legends are made of.  However, the brisket was less than legendary.  Based on what I'd heard and read I expected the meat to be on point and have some passion infused into it.  

Pork - The pork had great flavor, was cooked perfectly and didn't have a single piece of gristle in it.  It went well with any of the sauces (I had the flight)

Brisket - A disappointment.  It was either an inferior cut of meat or it was cooked wrong.  I could barely pull it apart with my hands as it was tough.  Once I finally got it apart it was tough and chewy.. It seemed like it had decent flavor in it, but was overshadowed by the texture of it.  

Sides - baked beans - very good.. had a bit of bacon in them and had great flavor. Applesauce - I wanted something light and this hit the spot.  Its applesauce, not much to screw up. 

Sauces - I liked the chipotle bbq.  It had great flavor and a little bit of spice.  The texas bbq and milo's mustard were also my favorites.. good all around flavor.  I didn't care for the peach ones, but to each his own, the others were good as well . 

I travel thru here for work so I'll swing by again and give it another whirl, but I'll probably steer clear of the brisket for a bit.. maybe I\"ll try the burnt ends?  
Till next time."}
{"text":"The chicken and sweet potato were delicious. The brisket tasted good but was overly greasy. The cornbread was unintelligible as cornbread- more like fried carrot cake. Overall underwhelming. Not worth the money. A bummer because I was expecting amazing."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. It's like an old narrow bar with plenty of counter & booth seats. The food is amazing. Everything we had was good, the brisket, jambalaya, twice baked potatoes, & sweet potato fries.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm from Kansas City, famous for BBQ, and I can say I've never tasted better BBQ than at Black Dog.  The Burnt Ends are simply the best thing I've ever eaten in my life.  When they are out of them, you can't go wrong with anything else on the menu.  Also, their margarita's are amazing.

I always look forward to Black Dog when I'm in Urbana the few times a year I go.  I can't wait to try out their new place opening later this year."}
{"text":"I wasn't all excited about a bbq joint, but my husband said they have salmon so I agreed.  He and my stepson have eaten here dozens of times and love the brisket and ribs.

Upon arrival you have to sign in, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.   This is not a large space, and is the smaller of the two locations.  We were seated in a booth next to the bar.  We had friendly service and I have to say the food was amazing.  I had the salmon platter with two sides.  I chose the purple slaw and twice-baked potato casserole.  The server recommend the mild Georgia Peach bbq sauce.  Everything was perfect.  

Another very efficient perk is the server uses a tablet to take orders, and then brings it back to check you out after your meal.  It's so fast."}
{"text":"I had the same exact meal two nights in a row.  This time we were in the larger of the two locations, and it was close to The Accord, where we were seeing a show that night.  We got seated at the bar right away.  I had the salmon platter with Georgia Peach BBQ Sauce, and my two sides were the purple slaw and twice-baked potato casserole. The salmon was so tender.  I've never had better.   

Our server/bartender made me a good Manhattan and was a friendly guy.

I'm definitely a new fan of Black Dog."}
{"text":"Ok soo.... This place is my favorite bbq in the whole world. Was taken here when it first opened and have been in love ever since. The wait is a little off putting at times but the hot georgia peach bbq sauce, burntends and cubans will keep me a lifelong customer. My only real complaint is make cubans available everyday!!!!"}
{"text":"We were originally going to go to Golden Harbor, but they are closed on Monday nights. So we decided to call Black Dog to see how long the wait is, when we heard it was only 10-15 mins wait, we wasted no time. We put our name down and still had to wait like 20-30 mins. We had 6 people so it was harder. They eventually squeezed the 6 of us in a booth. 

Burnt ends was amazing! It was so perfect. mmm! 

Ribs was also delicious. The meat came off the bone perfectly. 

Twice baked potato casserole tasted more like mashed potato. I didn't think it was very special. 

Beans were surprisingly good! I usually hate all types of beans, but I found myself trying more than 1 bite of my friend's dish. 

The only thing that I was MEH about was the sauce. I thought Georgia Peach was a bit too sweet, but the meat is already seasoned, so I didn't even eat it with the sauce.

We saw the owner working and he even talked to us about the food. He's such a chill guy and I can tell that he loves his job."}
{"text":"A great restaurant that you'll never regret going, especially if you try the Texas sauce."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I ordered a large pork sparerib which is enough for two people. Beef rib is a little greasy the speed of food deliver is fast but there is a long queue during dinner time."}
{"text":"Since I got to Champaign, I have been recommended by several of my friends to try this place. I had an opportunity to try the pulled pork sandwich with my choice in egg salad and sweet potato fries. The food tasted fantastic. The pork was seasoned quite well and glazed quite nicely. It is no wonder there is often a waiting line in order to be seated. The service was also excellent despite being packed. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Champaign and are looking for a bite."}
{"text":"It's a little disappointed that they ran out of burnt end. So I ordered the 2 meat platter, brisket and the ribs. 

The brisket is kind of dry and the ribs are good"}
{"text":"I guess if there is nothing else around the mediocre places get good ratings. 
Paid 50$ incl tip for 2 people. Shared a 3 item combo and 2 beers each. 
Seriously overpriced. 
Tough ribs, fatty veined chicken, out of turkey, out of burnt ends, out of ... i mean come on. 
Anyways, you're better off hitting up a chain like famous Dave's, they give you more and better quality food."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are really good. The sides are mediocre. The restaurant layout is odd, with tables crowded together. The service is poor. The waiter we had was obnoxious, very loud, and overly chatty. It was hard to enjoy our meal. The portions are very small. It is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Burnt ends, not brisket.  Can't speak for the ribs or pulled pork.  Stuffed cornbread did not fit the menu's description (was mixed with the ingredients instead of stuffed), but was glorious.  2 sticks of butter will make anything good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some top notch BBQ I highly recommend this place. Craft beer all over. Good prices to. There's also this adorable dark haired server that always takes care of me. Super pretty eyes and nice smile. Can't remember her name but I think it starts with an H. Overall, great place to dine!"}
{"text":"I like to treat myself to a wonderful dinner on my birthday.  I've spent four birthdays at blackdog. Enough said."}
{"text":"My favorite Urbana BBQ joint. Love the smoked sweet potato and succotash. I visit every time I'm in town.  Expect a short wait for a table - but it's worth it."}
{"text":"What a great experience!!  Service is outstanding and the food is delicious.  Great selection of cocktails and beer as well.

Smoked Artichoke Dip w/ freshly fried tortilla chips
Brisket Combo w/ Habanero BBQ sauce
Catfish & Ribs Platter w/ Hot Georgia Peach BBQ sauce

Sides:  
 - Cornbread
 - Sweet Potato Fries
 - Beans
 - Baked Sweet Potato

Our bill for 2 with beers, came out to $60 before tip for all this food."}
{"text":"We had the chips and salsa, pulled pork, prime rib, fries, and cornbread muffin. It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"I believe this may be the best BBQ I have ever eaten.  Each dish had a unique and very original flavor.  From the cornbread to the potato salad I was amazed at how they could take simple dishes and make them not only delicious but also distinctive.  We had the combo platter and all of the meats were juicy and succulent!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to have a love-hate relationship with a restaurant? I was so excited that a Black Dog location was coming closer to my home, and let me say right up front that the food is ambrosial; the ribs are among the best I've ever tasted. However, now having sampled both the Urbana and Champaign shops, I'm convinced management knows their menu is so superb that they don't really need to care about customer service. Dining in at the Dog is an eternal-wait, cattle call experience in the best of times; now, at the Champaign location, for carryout there is a single line for both ordering and paying for food, which completely defeats the advantage of calling ahead for one's order. After standing in line for several minutes (while my call-ahead order cooled), I decided to have a drink at the bar. Five minutes later, I still wanted a drink at the bar. I don't believe anybody is too busy to say, \"Be with you in a minute\" or \"welcome to Black Dog,\" but apparently they are. I've yet to have a totally positive encounter at Black Dog. My treatment (or lack of same) at the Urbana location during a 2014 visit was so abysmal that a friend informed the owner, who issued a gift certificate. I don't want free food; I want great food from a great staff. I want to be excited about going to the Black Dog, not decide I want a meal there despite the service."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch every Thursday. Black Dog Burrito Thursday, we call it. Today, 3 members of my group had to wait a whole 2 minutes because the other 2 people in the party hadn't arrived yet. Then, when we (the late arrivers, by 2 minutes) finally showed up, we were immediately given a booth. I thought this place was supposed to be good. So good that you had to wait for seating. Well, with the opening of the Champaign location, the Urbana location is now sort of a forgotten wasteland (I guess like the rest of Urbana). 
We were immediately informed that they were out of Burnt Ends. WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIVING?!?!? Did you know you can get a burnt ends burrito on Thursdays? WELL TODAY YOU COULDN'T!!  Had to settle for the regular delicious pulled pork burrito. As did 2 others in the group. Another ordered a burger (people, don't you know you are only supposed to order a burger when ALL the other menu items are 86'd) and another got a brisket sandwich. 
I ordered a mountain dew, while another person at the table started hitting on me. He called me Sweetie. Which apparently was a mistake on my part when I started rubbing his leg and he informed me that actually he had ordered \"sweet tea\". Oops. 
The food came out very quickly. I didn't even have time to complain about not having the time to eat my burnt ends appetizer which I didn't get to order. Oh, we got there at 11:30, they had been open for 30 minutes and didn't have burnt ends. I blame the guys that were sitting at the table closest to the bar! There were 4 of them and 3 of them smugly ate those delicious burnt ends as we sat there, envious, with only a pulled pork burrito to fill the void that was left by not having burnt ends. 
They had the chex mix today. Which is a first, because in all the other times I've been there, there was no chex mix. But today there was. I would sacrifice all the chex mix in the world for just one more chance at a burnt ends appetizer. 
The price was reasonable. My bill (which was presented on one of those new fangled tablet pc thingies) was 13. Which covered the burrito, a side of the potato salad, and the soda. I don't consider that excessive. 
The staff was (and always is) friendly. Except for that guy with a beard and a Mohawk, what kind of an idiot would have that kind of look. He wasn't there today. 
Why is troy a rocket scientist?"}
{"text":"This place is a total rip off. Someone goes and makes a successful business and then someone else comes along and totally steals their idea. 
You know how I love Urbana Black Dog, right. 
Well, On Wednesday kridz and I decide to go into \"black dog smoke and ale house\" in champaign. 
This place totally stole the idea of what the urbana black dog is. They took the logo, the name, the menu looks exactly the same (what kind of corporate spies did they employ to make the menu look the same!!!). Heck, I even recognize some of the wait staff, so they probably poached them from the urbana black dog as well!
We walk in and get seated at the bar, look over the menu, and what do you know, just like the business in urbana that they are stealing the idea from, they are low on burnt ends (how original champaign!) There are like 4 things they are out of. It's a plot to make this \"black dog\" appear to be just as good as Urbana. I WILL NOT BE MISLED!
Just like urbana, whenever they are low on items the working crew shouts out how many are left. Then when something is all gone \"86'd burnt ends\"! Come up with your own gimmick already!
I guess the food was ok. Considering it wasn't the REAL black dog. 
I guess the liquor selection was ok, as was the beer selection, but Black Dog, this place ain't!

(edit; I've just been told this place is owned by the same people, so nevermind)"}
{"text":"I have been to black dog many times and I thought I had reviewed it but guess I was wrong. Anyways, today is day.This is the only place in Urbana where I go when I crave for BBQ. I love love love burnt end sandwich and God has been very gracious with me as whenever I order it, it's available :). I always order it with Carolina red sauce. The meat just melts in your mouth and it has awesome smoky flavor. For side, I always go with twice baked potato casserole. It's yum. I can go only for the casserole also. Till now, I never had to wait much in line, again I'm lucky. I am yet to try their Champaign location."}
{"text":"Food is good. Been there several times with great experiences, but this time the owner was horribly rude to my party. A couple of our friends stopped by briefly to say hello and he tried to be a bouncer and kick them out.  Unacceptable.  

It's a  shame when people in the service industry lack manners."}
{"text":"Extremely rude when we walked in...one of the servers yelled at us for not waiting to be seated in front of everyone in the joint when the other waitress had seated us. We left immediately, because it was embarrassing and uncalled for. I'm sure the food is great, but that's no way to treat anyone, especially your guests."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets a lot of hype. The food is really delicious--all aspects; I have not been disappointed.

So far I've tried the beef brisket and pulled pork; along with the twice-baked potato casserole, and sweet potato fries.

The cornbread does have pulled pork in it but it's not the most amazing thing I've had. It's alright, I thought the flavor would be more apparent but it was just okay.

It can take the LONGEST time to get a seat but that's okay. So far our servers have been kind, except one time where we had such a horrid experience with one waitress who was just in the worst mood. Otherwise, we had another server who was much nicer.

I need to go back!"}
{"text":"This new Black Dog location is huge! A lot of seating at the tables and at the bar with many large screens throughout. The day we can it was particularly full because of a game going on. We were able to get some seats at the bar with little wait. I got a pulled pork sandwich with hot Georgia peach sauce and a side of twice baked potato casserole (my fave).  Both were delicious! The potato casserole was creamy and wonderfully flavored! Mmmm. My sandwich was also delicious and packed that smokey flavor we all enjoy from the Urbana location. Service was great and I didn't feel rushed! I think I'll make it to this location more often."}
{"text":"The cornbread has really went down hill!!! The need to bring back the wedges of cornbread. Meat is average and the wings are good. Burnt ends are fatty."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall BBQ place."}
{"text":"Amazing place for BBQ. Their pulled pork is amongst the best I've tasted. The Amish Chicken platter was equally good."}
{"text":"I jave been here a couple times. Love their food!! The line is very long but its worth the wait! The price is reasonable in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pork ribs and catfish fillet are FANTASTIC. These are the two that I strongly recommend! They have decent amount of sides if you go with a meat combo. In terms of price, a meat combo of 2 plus tips is roughly 20 bucks, which I believe is worth it considering the quality of their food.
One interesting fact: The waiters use iPads to handle everything including taking orders and making payments so we don't have to leave our seat to go to a checkout counter or something like that..."}
{"text":"Had the bacon wrapped meatloaf and burnt ends appetizer. The service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. Our food came out fast and hot. As with everything here it was spectacular! 

Will we return? Again and again!"}
{"text":"SOOOOOO GOOOOOD. It really is. Most of the time there is a wait for seating, but it's totally worth it! Great service and staff and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"smoke duck is running out pretty soon on Thursday night. The service here is very nice."}
{"text":"Black Dog is my favorite barbecue joint of all time. The original Urbana location has such charm - plan to arrive before they open at 11 AM to get seated right away! 

My regular order is a burnt ends sandwich with the twice baked potato casserole on the side. You'll want to to get there early (11 am or 5 pm) to snag the burnt ends before they run out! The chipotle sauce packs some amazing flavor and some heat without being overwhelmingly spicy. The potato casserole side is both creamy and cheesy, providing perfect compliment to the tangy barbecue sauce. 

If you're in town, be sure to give Black Dog a try - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ in CU; however, that bar is set pretty low. 

I've been here twice and I very much enjoyed my first meal.  I never got to the second...

Services is horrible.  I used to wait tables, so I tend to be extra patient with servers/ bartenders.  

Because there were only two of us, we sat at the bar.  After 10 minutes, the server/ hostess/ table cleaner handed us menus.  After 20 minutes, we tried ordering some drinks from the bartender who, in turn, was rude to us.  After 25 minutes, and the server taking the orders of TWO tables who sat down AFTER us, we just left.

I understand being busy, but having the one and only server handling ALL the tables and everyone at the bar is ridiculous.  I'm not sure why they even had a bartender.

In future, we'll just go to Hickory River.  The atmosphere isn't as great, but at least we get to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for barbecue . They were out of my favorite choices .. Ordered pork ribs and brisket with a twice baked potato casserole. They were delish. The beans were ehhhh..   Service was excellent! I prefer this location. It's more cozy than the Champaign one.
Well worth the visit next time your in the area ."}
{"text":"Food is very good. my favorite is the burnt end sandwich. Sweet potato fries are okay but it's a bit dry, should probably dip it in honey or something. However my one biggest complaint is the wait. every time i've came here it's been an hour wait. The burnt ends are usually gone long before dinner. In fact, i got laughed at once when I came in at 9pm asking for burnt ends. It's good that it's opened till 11pm which is an hour more than most restaurants on campus. However, considering the amount you pay, I would rather go to lil porgy's.. better bang for my buck and their rib tips are ah mazing for less than $6."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as it has a really cool vibe.  It's located in an old train station and the setting is cool.  Pretty good beer selection but when I went to order a nitro beer the bartender told me they have never been able to get the nitro taps right and it isn't good.  Kind of a bummer.  What was really disappointing was the barbecue.  It just flat missed the mark.  I ordered a three meat platter which had a ridiculously small portion of meat compared to the $21 that it cost to order.  I had the hot link, pulled pork, and burnt ends.  The hot link was great.  The pulled pork was ok, but this restaurant is really confused as to what a burnt end is.  A burnt end is chopped pieces of brisket that has crust on all sides.  It is not a slice of regular brisket that has been overcooked, which is what I got here.  The barbecue here is not pit barbecue either and you can taste that it came from a kitchen smoker, it has an acrid smoke taste (Famous Dave's tastes the same way).  Maybe it's a city regulation that they can have a pit but it still doesn't taste the same.  The other disappointing thing here is that the barbecue sauces are Ala Carte.  I have never seen a barbecue restaurant change for sauce before.  The vinegar sauce and the Texas barbecue sauce were pretty good.  I did not care for the peach sauces.  So, in summary come here for the beer and atmosphere.  Skip the barbecue."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on reviews on Yelp, unfortunately out of Burnt Ends so tried the tacos.....both brisket and pork, found both to be very dry and lacking flavor.....probably should have offered bbq sauce instead of salsa. Next time I'm going through the area I'll try a different restaurant"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review with a note that I've long been a Black Dog apostle, starting back when when I first visited a mere 4 years ago. BBQ this good was never this affordable (OK, this was only true for a few years, prices have gone up but not to Chicago levels). I only wish this place was in existence when I was a student here.

Lately though I've abandoned my faith in The Dog with several sorely disappointing visits in a row. This last week I went for a pick 2 platter and had brisket & ribs: the ribs were rubber on the bone. It was hard enough to pull off meager scraps, I gave up and left meat on the bones and confessed to the waiter I was disappointed. Pork ribs, the backbone (almost literally) of a BBQ joint should never be a letdown. The pit master has been smoking for (at the very least) 10 years and should know how to make a side of pork delicious. They have done it consistently before! A month ago the ribs were tasty, tender-ish, but skimpy. Not once have I been impressed with the cut of pork and the quantity of meat you get. But last year they were better. Every month they get worse and worse.

I see Black Dog on lists of \"Americas Best\" and am proud of what I can only hope will be an Illini staple for decades to come. But they have grown too fast and must be rushing the food out of the smoker. Hone in the ovens, get the smoke right, and turn out a quality product for the love of Holy Pork.

The brisket was fine - burnt ends are good an all but I prefer not to slurp down chunks of fat bark. I can say the brisket isn't the best I've had but it has always been pretty solid. Turkey, salmon, jumbalaya, chicken, beef ribs - have always been tasty but on par with every BBQ joint worth their salt. Doing all of them well has been a sign of quality.

The new place in Champaign is fine. I feel a missed opportunity to make this location into an epic vintage locale, and perhaps someone should break in and fix the crap orange sponge painted walls. A reboot of the atmosphere with some coherent theme would be welcome.

I want my old Black Dog back please. I go to the Urbana location for atmosphere, but the food must be coming from the same cook house. I am only too eager to revisit this review in a few months and hopefully eat my words. But at least here you get more than you paid for."}

{"text":"Food:fantastic!!!! Service:terrible. Despite the fact we ordered a cocktail and a beer,we were literally kicked out of our barstools,rudely,I might add, to make room for diners.Our wait is always ridiculously long and for a restaurant so known for its food...why the HUMONGOUS bar?? (where...you arent allowed to sit)( and good luck getting a bartender to make eye contact with you) Entirely inadequate waiting area and dreadful floorplan that does not work for such a busy restaurant. The waiters are hit and miss...ours tonight was not attentive at all. We were in a large party and everyone needed drink refills...everyone had an empty glass and mouths on fire. We love the food though, when we are fortunate enough for them to not be out of everything...they just need to get their act together outside of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Short wait. Wish we could've gotten the burnt ends but the brisket and ribs were awesome. Sauce sampler was a great choice. Will be back next year when we come back to school"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Champaign. It is always super busy and you have to wait in line whether it is before they open or any time during the day. Part of the demand is the small restaurant space, but the food itself is top notch and likely the best BBQ restaurant in IL. I have been here twice and only tried the burnt end sandwich. It is always too busy for me to come for dinner especially if you have a kid due to the limited booth spaces. The burnt end sandwich is a culinary masterpiece due to the nice smokiness of the the beef along with the crunch of the cole slaw and the acidity/sweetness of the georgia peach bbq sauce. I like my bbq sauce with spices and on the sweet side. They have a large selection of bbq sauce which I have not even tried yet. You also get a side which for me is the double baked potato. This is simply cooked to perfection loaded with cheese not too salty or heavy. I always want to try something else for lunch, but just knowing the burnt ends are limited makes me order this off the menu! Easily a 5 star + restaurant down here in Champaign

Pros: flavorful bbq, great sauce selection, the dishes are well balance and have the right taste along with the perfect texture blend

Cons: you have to wait a long time if you come late, we were here 5 minutes early and the restaurant was immediately full after they opened the door and the line was forming around the corner

{"text":"Great expansion to the first location, the food is still the same excellent quality and price, now in the much bigger location!  This has greatly reduced the wait time for me to get my favorite bbq and twice baked potato casserole fixings.  :D"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on March 3rd and it was an enjoyable experience! Didn't have to wait too long for a seat and the server was quick to see to us. Started out with the chips and salsa which were quite tasty. The beer wasn't half bad either. We got the pulled pork platter with Mac and cheese and beans for a side. The sides were pretty bland and not the best. The pork was great and the BBQ sauce options are nice. Overall, would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"For lack of a better way to put it, SOOOOOOO GOOOOD! I was born and raised in the boonies of Texas and I can tell you that this is as good as it gets for BBQ in the north (I am a little biased). Great service, great drinks and amazing food. Expect to wait a bit for a table on weekends/holidays but it is 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"this place is worth the wait! 

although the wait at the door may be long, the order turnaround is speedy and the food is absolutely orgasmic! you'll find yourself inappropriately suckling the boney remains of your meal. seriously. check it out."}
{"text":"We had been holding out going here for a long time because I don't eat meat and I had heard that the only non meat item on the menu was a grilled cheese!  Well was I ever wrong!  The menu offers quite a few items for non meat eaters, a smoked catfish, salmon (on Friday and Saturday) a falafel  plate AND a grilled cheese!  My son and husband started off with wings and then moved on to the burnt end sandwiches, one choosing potato salad the other choosing fries and i had the smoked catfish.  Always health conscious I had to ensure that the items were not fried and the extremely friendly and helpful waitress assured me, no they were only smoked.  All I can say is WE ARE CONVERTS!!!!  No other barbeque places for us anymore.  My husband and son agreed that 10 out of 10 times they would get the burnt ends sandwich(one note to others-this does run out).  As for my catfish?  Delicious, mouth watering, healthy and left me wanting to come back often-thanks Black Dog for offering outstanding BBQ for us all!!!!!"}
{"text":"After a few years, I'm sorry to downgrade my initial 5-star review. Here are the reasons:

1. The prices have increased substantially in the last few years. It's no longer a great value. If you buy a sandwich, side, and a drink, you're spending around $13 (counting tax and tip). Yeah, I get that some of their meat is coming from local farms and stuff and it's more expensive as a result. I really don't care. The use of local animals has priced me out of the restaurant. 

2. The wait times are completely unacceptable. Unless you eat between 2-4pm, you can count on a wait of around 30-45 minutes. It's okay if you want this to be your major activity of the night, but sadly, it's no longer a place where you can stop in for a quick and inexpensive BBQ sandwich. 

The mix of inconvenience and increased cost has led me to downgrade my review of what was formerly one of my favorite restaurants. 

Also, I'm not nearly as impressed with the quality of the food after trying Smoque BBQ in Chicago. Previously, I thought that Black Dog was amongst the best BBQ in the nation, but as good as it is, there is no comparison to Smoque when it comes to the meat."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Amazing smoked flavor on chicken wings appetizer, the brisket and Ribs combo plate I ordered .. A must. Very good pricing too. Well worth the wait. The staff is great. Be ready to go through a roll of paper towels it it finger licking good."}
{"text":"When you're the talk of the town then folks should expect a wait when arriving during dinner hour at Black Dog.

While the hostess was a bit brusque, our bartender was helpful. Started out with the Texas Caviar for $2.95 which is a great accompaniment to your beer while waiting for the main course. We decided to share plate the combo platter for $13.95 with burnt ends and turkey with a side of mac'n'cheese and green beans. Both of the sides were okay, but we were more than pleasantly surprised by the meat choices. Moist, yet smokey, with just enough bark. If my belly could've handled it, we would've ordered more meat options. As someone who can get seriously picky about smoked meat, I give Black Dog a thumbs up for serving up finding that balance between succulent but not dry. We also ordered the $2 BBQ sauce sampler which I wanted to drink...so instead we drizzled it on our meat, drizzled it on our mac'n'cheese and drizzled it on our chips. 

Nice atmosphere. Decent service. Awesome meats.

Oh and PS....even the bar seats are by seating only, so don't make the mistake of identifying that open bar stool to grab a beer while waiting. The hostess will school you on your mistake."}
{"text":"Great place! The long wait was worth it. Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Their Hot Georgia Peach sauce was absolutely killer."}
{"text":"Went here shortly after they opened up for dine in.

Had a great time. The interior was gorgeous, the service was great as usual (compared to Urbana location), and the food tasted just as good as the original location (which is amazing - best BBQ i've had thus far in my life).

Can't wait to come again sometime soon"}
{"text":"I love the food but I really don't like the snooty help! 
I went to black dog to get takeout and sat down at the bar. I have always been told the bar is first come first serve. The bartender asked me what I wanted and I said I just wanted to order take out. He told me that he thought the waitress was going to sit some people where I was sitting and told me to come down to the area where orders are picked up. First problem, I am a paying customer and it was busy. Second problem, it's a bunch of crap to direct a paying customer to stand for 15+ minutes. Third problem, I like the food but I don't love it and I can certainly go without the unneeded crap from the bartender not to mention the attitude from a waitress that we are the best. 

Even if a restaurant is the best being condescending and arrogant will keep me from coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love!  The BBQ is quite good.  We go as often as we can and buy sauce to bring home for later."}
{"text":"We are here and everyone enjoyed their meal only complaint was noise level and seating. I will return."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday terrible there were more diced onions and cilantro than pulled pork. Not going back to that location maybe better luck in ur"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  It's the best bbq in Urbana-Champaign by far.  I've never had something bad at Black Dog.  The pulled pork, beef brisket, and burgers are all fantastic, and you can't really go wrong with any of the sides.  Definitely get the cornbread  - it's amazing and has pulled pork inside of it.  The only downside is that it gets really crowded and there isn't much room to wait for a table, but it's definitely worth the wait.  Oh, and if you plan on getting burnt ends, get there when it opens because they'll run out pretty quick."}
{"text":"best barbecue joint in central Illinois. hands down. one of the best hard-to-find bourbon selections around. a MUST if you're on town for a game!! but get there early. doors open at 11 and the line starts forming @ 1030."}
{"text":"I keep coming back. There's almost perpetually a wait unless you go midafternoon but it's worth it. I would also caution against taking people with mobility issues or trouble hearing in noise there; it's crowded without a lot of buffers for sound and there are raised booths and raised tables that can be challenging to sit at comfortably. You can get takeout though!

Everything they sell is delicious but I love their Georgia peach sauce, their twice baked potato cassarole, and their mac and cheese. The meat is legitimately the best I've ever had.  

Service used to be more perfunctory and not great for newbies but now I think servers act to ensure you know what you're getting into. I think they've also become more friendly."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say I am not the biggest barbecue fan. I don't really eat much meat and I don't like smoky/molasses-y sauces. But I do love this place. The chicken and fish are both delicious and they actually offer a really good Carolina sauce (think zesty vinegar-based goodness) which I love. The portions are also pretty great and the sides are all amazing no matter what you get. Definitely go here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I'll just get it out of the way and say it... I really dislike most barbecue. I don't like smoky, dark, thick barbecue sauce or most smoked meat. But I have to say when I finally went and got the chicken (with the Carolina Vinegar \"barbecue\" sauce), it became a quick favorite right along with the cornbread, cocktails, and beer list. So glad this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better. Certainly not a place I'd go for a relaxing dining experience. 

Went on a Thursday night, and was ushered in to two seats at the end of the bar by the hostess. The bartender/server was nice and was around enough to take our order, and the service was very efficient, almost too efficient. I certainly felt rushed to order, eat my food, pay my bill, and leave so the people waiting could eat. I've been to much busier BBQ places like Oklahoma Joes in Kansas City that operates a similar size joint  out of a gas station and it's all self seating, and although most people won't sit there all day while others wait, they don't hurry you out after you've waiting your turn in line. I probably still had half my food on my plate when I was asked \"are you all done with that?\"... seriously? 

As for the food, I ordered the cornbread appetizer, and the pork inside was a interesting touch, which I liked. Before we could finish our cornbread the food was already served. I got the pulled pork/brisket combo with twice baked casserole and slaw. The sides were pretty good, though my GF's potato salad had zero flavor. The meat was nothing special. Yes, it was tender, but the pulled pork almost looked roasted rather than smoked, and having an ice cream scoop shaped pork was kinda odd.  

The house sauce was what really killed it for me. I really couldn't put my finger on what I don't like about it but the sweet, smoky, kick it has just doesn't do anything for me but overpower the flavor of the meat. 

And like everyone else says, the place is packed and cramped all the time. If this place is so great then they should give the customer a good overall dining experience and not just rely on their food. I'll try going back again sometime, and who knows I may hit the lottery and be able to get their seemingly impossible to get burnt ends."}
{"text":"I love the burnt ends, but give the salmon sandwich a chance on the weekends! It is to die for!! Great beer selection. I love all the sides (although the portions of corn bread used to be bigger.)

One of the best places to eat in town!"}
{"text":"So, here I am in Memphis just a few steps away from Beale St and Union Ave and some of the best BBQ Joints in the world and I find I'm longing for BBQ back here at home.

Call me biased but, after eating BBQ at Rum Boogie, Charlie Vergos' Rendezvous, Memphis Co BBQ in the past month. 

I'm finding nothing beats the ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket topped with Black Dog Smoke & Ale's Georgia Peach BBQ sauce.

I dare you to compare and if you are honest with yourself...you'll end up at Black Dog for the best BBQ in your entire life and not even the places in the land of the Blues, Rock & Roll and awesome southern BBQ joints will even come close!"}
{"text":"I'm pissed I only discovered this place in my last 2 years on campus. I think it's impossible to order anything and not like it, even a little.

I was back on campus last weekend and tried the Chicken Wings - a seriously underestimated menu item. See, just when I think I've tried it all, I discover something else that's awesome.

The chef likes to get creative with the daily specials too- so that's fun.

Wow, I've already done all this raving and I haven't even had to start talking about their alcohol selection. In my opinion, it's a crime not to order a specialty beer off their vast tap list to wash down their killer BBQ. 

Students at U of I - get here as often as possible before graduation!"}
{"text":"It's okay. When I first got here, I felt like this place was awesome but that's cuz I would only order the ribs and the ribs are on point.  Lately I've been venturing out and ordering other things on the menu.  I haven't been impressed. But the ribs?  Go for the ribs."}
{"text":"Best pricing for the amount of food you get. Amazing BBQ and great drinks. Very clean and great for groups. 100% would recommend anything there if you are a BBQ lover"}
{"text":"I hate barbecue and this place is amazing. When my parents were helping me move in, we went three nights in a row"}
{"text":"I was in town from Chicago visiting my friend for the weekend and she suggested this place when I told her I was craving bbq. She spoke very highly of it and I was so excited to try it!!! 

I would like to say first and foremost that I have been in the restaurant/bar industry for around 6 years and I know what it is like to work in a busy environment...though there was a wait, it was NOT busy enough to provide THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.

We arrived and the hostess (a gentleman) greeted us with a face of annoyance. I saw an extra chair at the bar and asked if we could pull up an extra one and sit there. With annoyance he answered with \"Not right now.\" We were never told that the bar was also a part of the seating wait. We asked how long the wait was and received yet another look of annoyance stating there were sixteen tables waiting ahead of us with no time frame. I really wanted to try the food so we decided to take it to go. By this time I was upset considering, like i previously mentioned, I work in the industry and know how to give customer service to build rapport. I asked the guy taking our order if the hostess was the owner and he informed me that the hostess wasn't but he in fact was the owner, omitting to ask if there was something he could do for us. I did not mention what horrible service we were receiving because I like to be more professional but while we were waiting for our food we over heard two other customers become disappointed at the responses they were receiving from the hostess. 

Honestly though the food was good my friend nor I will EVER come back here. Come on dude, step up your game if your gonna be a popular place in a small town. AWFUL SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Go to place every time I'm in Champaign. Some great barbecue and local beers. Taco Tuesday special is my personal favorite.
Get there early as there is a limited amount of meats each day!"}
{"text":"Decent food but the several times I've been there only the first visit did I have a decent service experience.  Every time after that has been long waits, rude staff, and/or menu items not available.  In general I just don't find the food to be good enough to make it worth the trouble.  I don't get the hype and hearing people rave about Black Dog is, frankly, annoying."}
{"text":"This is shoot yo mama, lip smackin good.
Way busy, always have to wait.  But it is worth it. The only problem with the place is that the staff never smiles.  They are just too busy, and it shows.
The BBQ is awesome.  I believe I liked a peach BBQ sauce the best.   
The price is right. The place is like a diamond in the rough.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Every single bite of my meal here was amazing. The burnt ends are insanely good. The service was also top notch. It's not often I go somewhere and don't have anything to say about something but here there is no one bad thing to say.  So if you want some killer BBQ this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Cult local following.  It's very good.  See other reviews for more description.  I just don't quite see all the hype, but I guess people in C-U need something to be gaga over, and Black Dog probably is legitimately the best option."}
{"text":"This is the place if you're feeling BBQ. You'll need to know when the rush hours are to avoid lines. One time we had literally 100 people ahead of us! (You can see who's ahead of you on the board right as you walk in. And yes, you should put your own name on the board followed by the amt of ppl in your party).

Burnt ends and pork belly are my favs. The casserole is unique with its baked outer layer. Can't forget the daily specials like collard greens. All of the entrees pair really well with their iced tea. Is this place overhyped? Yes. You won't see me buying a shirt anytime soon. Does that make this place less decent than it is? No. BD's definitely worth a try if you like meat, and a lot of it."}
{"text":"Black Dog in Champaign might've ran into bumps in the beginning, but they've settled down and it's been a smooth riding. I've gone here several times in a party of 2, and have never waited too long for seats (at the bar) & fast service. Plus they run out of burnt ends less!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY thing I can complain about is one of the things I love about Black Dog, it is TINY so you'll have to get lucky or wait for a seat.

We've had the brisket, sausage, ribs, pork belly, burger and almost every side on the menu AMAZING, even the salsa is smoky and wonderful. 

It's cheaper than going to a chain resturant and the food is melt in your mouth delish!!!  Even my 7 year old loves it and asks for it on a regular basis"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. WORTH. THE. WAIT.
Only downside... sweet tea could be sweeter. I'm used to South Carolina sweet tea, so I needed to add 4 sugars to mine (no judgement!). Food was excellent though. If i'm ever back in the area, I'm definitely making it back here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten BBQ from Memphis to KC and this is right there with the best of them. I usually eat at the one in Urbana but they are basically the same. Brisket to pork to salmon. You can not go wrong. Food and staff are the best. 

They routinely have specials like smoked bacon wrapped meatloaf today. Pork belly which I'm getting tomorrow. I highly recommend Black Dog!"}
