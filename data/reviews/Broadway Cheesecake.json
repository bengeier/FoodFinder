{"text":"I've been to the Broadway Cheesecake on President Kennedy so I guess this review only applies to that location. Anyway, what I like about BC is that they offer mini cupcake versions of their cheesecake, so it's smaller than a slice, which is sometimes too heavy. I had the strawberry white chocolate cheesecake, and well, it tasted like cheesecake. It wasn't GREAT by any means, but tasted pretty average. Next time I come, I'm definitely giving their food a try- the menu looks pretty appetizing!The staff were super friendly and McGill students get 10% with their student cards!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My go to when I'm not sure what I want to eat considering they have so many options, or when I want a piece of their cakes. The service is friendly, the young asian girl is amazing at her job and makes me smile, and you can hang out if you feel like just having a coffee and dessert. Open late and they have good music on for the atmosphere. Maybe make the filtered coffee free refill, but I've asked before and they never had a problem with it. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Just tried to order 3 different plates,none of them were available. Same goes with the drinks. Stop showing an extensive listing for nothing."}
{"text":"Desserts are really good and worth going for. All kitchen food is not bad, but definitely not their specialty."}
{"text":"paradis sur terre pour les amateurs de cupcakes et de cheesecake (comme moi). Le Broadway Cheesecake est un genre de petit café ou on y sert plusieurs variété de cheesecake. Du classique a la confiture à celui au Hershey's pépites, vous trouverez tout ce que vous désirez pour apaiser votre envie de sucre et de mou.  En plus de gros gâteaux tranchés, vous pouvez aussi apporter des formats cupcakes qui sont, ma foi, divins. Essayez le Oréo et le Red Velvet !"}
{"text":"Best cheesecake ever!!!!  They have a lot to choose from too so it more interesting if your like me and go often.  They have food and it's good but clearly not their specialty.  I have not tried their drinks because I only go there for cheesecake and I have no complaints with those.  You can get a piece, a whole cake and even cupcakes. Not too expensive a piece is around 7$ or so but all worth it"}
{"text":"I visited this place 3 times already! I have to tell, its expensive, they have a lot of choice in the menu but when you actually get what you want, you get deception as well. I would have ordered a coffee from their alcoholic coffee menu but the guy told me they had no alcohol permit. Why do they even put them in the menu if they are not available? I ended up with a regular coffee which cost me 3 dollars. Yes like i said before they are expensive. The cake i ordered was supposed to be a cheese cake. Instead of cheese it was made from powdered milk, gelatin and other ingredient used in industrial processed food. The worst part of this cake is not the fact that its was not made from cheese. Its the fact that they charged me 10 dollars for an industrial processed cake. On their website they say their not getting cheese from their supplier at the moment and many cakes are not available because of that. they have cheese cake in their name but they don't have cheese cakes. They are selling fake cheese cakes instead with no cheese in them for the same price they use to sell the real ones."}
{"text":"It's very pricey and service tends to be slow (understaffed) but there are interesting cheesecakes to try. The KitKat cheesecake was a rich chocolaty slice without being too heavy or too sweet. Fans of dark chocolate, do try. Expect to pay at least $10/slice after tax and gratuities. At least they're open until midnight and it's easily accessed by car.  Tip: Don't wait for service, just be proactive and fill your own water, stand up and go to the cash to pay. Enjoy a good slice of cheesecake and get out."}
{"text":"they changed the menu and took all  my favorite stuff down... used to love this place but i will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Been on a road trip from Alberta to Montreal this place is the cake , amazing cheese cakes good , I'm glad I don't live here or I need to join weight watchers !!"}
{"text":"Overrated... Food is bad and cheesecakes are ok. Bad service, waited 45 mins to have cold food. Dont waste your money!"}
{"text":"Its been over a year since I have been to broadway cheese cake and now I remember why. OMG never again am I coming here, everything was bad, As soon as we sat down I asked our waitress (Kelly-Ann) if she could bring a bottle of water, so she brought tap water for my friend and a bottle for me. I then asked her if she could bring a glass. A few minutes later she came to take our orders, I ordered hot chocolate with no whip cream and my friend ordered those big cafe au lait in a bowl with a carrot cheesecake. First of all she brought my hot chocolate with whip cream so I asked her to bring it back. She came back with a new one and it was cold even my friends coffee was cold and I don't me warm it was cold cold, the cheesecake wasn't that great either. The Place was maybe half full and the waitress kept coming to our table asking us if we were done, which we weren't and we were catching up so we were in no hurry to leave.  Then she came and filled up my glass of water (spring water) with tap water???? What the hell? There is a reason why I didn't want tap water lady!!!!! Then she asked us if we wanted the bill and we said no, well guess what 5 minutes later she brought us 2 bills. I mean i would understand if the place was full and you had a line up of customers. But that simply wasn't the case. I just did not feel welcomed and will not be going back ever again. Cheesecake not good, service bad, this is why your restaurant is half empty on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Bon service, la nourriture est bonne et le cheesalcake crème brûlée était bon et bourrant."}
{"text":"Two experiences there.  First : just for a cheesecake. From a place called like that, you would expect something fresh  and really good, like, I don't know, it was the purpose of the place, right ? I had the carrot\"cheese\"cake and it was just bad. Tasted like industrial tasteless cake, too much icing, I didn't even finish it, just disappointing.   Second time for dinner, and yeah it's not really a fancy place anyway, I wasn't expecting much. Average burger on a very sad and empty plate just filled with frozen fries.  Ok service, not too expensive for the burger (way too expensive for the quality of the cheesecake)  Won't go back"}
