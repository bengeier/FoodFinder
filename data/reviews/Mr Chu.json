{"text":"Good desserts at a good price. 
Mr. Chu offers ~$5 churros from a cart outside of a convenient store (joy mart). 
Even for when there is no line up, service is relatively slow. I went Saturday at 2pm, and there was no line up, and it still took about 10 minutes to get our churros. 

They have a unique concept with good options, but it didn't really strike me as something I needed to come back again for. 

I got the condensed milk churros with almond. It was doughy and tasty. Not too sweet or overwhelming. It definitely made my hands sticky! It was warm when they served it, which was pleasant, but again, their flavours didn't really stand out - not salty or sweet, or cold or hot."}
{"text":"This review is for the $2.50 regular Korean churro. The soft and freshly made churro topped with brown sugar and cinnamon is such a delight to have! If it is you're first time, don't expect the churro to be amazingly different from all other churros in the world, unless you're going for special. But the fact that the owner preps the fresh dough once you placed the order makes it really worthwhile. Extra props to the owner working full 12 hours a day everyday is some serious dedication."}
{"text":"Went to Mr. Chu today because it was shown has hot&new in yelp ~ its pretty for pictures and they give you lots of ice cream hehe ~ no sure if the inside is suppose to be so soft or just undercooked thou"}
{"text":"Fresh hot churro with ice cream!!! It's everything! Definitely will come back again! PS: need to wait 10-15mins for the order because the churro its fresh made. So try not to go around dinner time"}
{"text":"Awesome churros. Went the classic the first time and the condensed milk + almond the second time. Both were excellent. I'd probably go with the milk + almonds again next time. Hope more people find out about it cause it's a bit hidden."}
{"text":"Love their original churro! It's not a cheap snack but I think it's worth it and it's freshly made everytime."}
{"text":"Update: churros have cinnamon this time was extremely flavourful and very good on its own (didn't get ice cream this time). A++++++ super crispy !!!"}
{"text":"I think this was the first time I've had any type of churro, and after trying Mr. Chu, in short, I was MIND BLOWN about how good it was. 

Located in a small stall it was a little bit hard to spot but make sure you find them because it is well worth it. 

All their churros are made hot and fresh and you can feel and taste it! We ordered the Oreo churro with condensed milk and it was to die for. You would think that one churro wouldn't fill you up but it really does, we ended up sharing one between the two of us. 

The staff are all extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Really don't have anything to critique on. We all left 100% satisfied. Price is also very reasonable. Would recommend this spot 10/10!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool to have a legit churro vendor as a neighbor! The awesome treat did not disappoint. Love it that it was fresh and hot at first bite.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Left work early (from vaughan) to try this place! It was sooo good!! Tried the oreo churros&matcha ice cream , it was light and not too sweet. It's better than the non-asian churros. I can eat more (next time) for sure! Don't miss this yummy (and cute logo) churros."}
{"text":"I've been to mr.chu last week after school! I did not know the difference between the traditional churro and Korean style. Tbh, i liked mr.chu  churro than any other churro place because of their taste and great customer service. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best churros I've ever had. Hands down. Their special churro with condensed milk and oreo topping is their most popular and for good reason. The french vanilla ice cream was divine with the churro . 

Definitely satisfied my sweet tooth for the day."}
{"text":"Took my nephews here for a treat. Knew there would be a wait -- asked the young man working the cart how long, and he said 10-15 minutes. And it was indeed about 10 minutes. Nephews each got the churro with condensed milk and Oreo Cooking topping, and each scarfed it down in no time ;) Young man working the cart was lovely -- calm, kind and friendly. I took a bite of one of the churros: it was warm, rich, and delicious. This is a great little spot -- can only assume a proper storefront operation will open soon? Well done, Mr. Chu!"}
{"text":"Amazing churros at a cheap price made to order. Whenever I want churros, this is the first place I think of!!! Highly recommend! This place definitely deserves five stars- the hype is real!"}
{"text":"Located beside coco bubble tea. I got the chocolAte almond and my partner got the full service - ice cream and special churro condensed milk and Oreo. They said the most popular is condensed milk and Oreo. My suggestion: get the full service ice cream and special churro. Churro dipped in vanilla ice cream is soooooooo goooooood. Compared to other churro places in the gta, this is the best one I've ever had. There's only one minus point, there's no sit down benches/places. What about in the winter time??? But I guess churros are meant to be street food. Or you can always get your churros and get your Coco bubble tea next door and have a nice chill out afternoon/evening"}
{"text":"I was walking by and came across this amazing place, the price caught my eye and I'm glad I gave it a shot! I got the special churro glazed with condensed milk and Oreo crumb"}
{"text":"Located at the Yonge & Finch intersection, on Finch, west of Yonge. To be more exact - it's right beside Coco Bubble Tea. It's literally a mini food truck with eye-catching yellow signs - so won't be hard to miss.

Friendly staff. There'sh only 2 items on the menu - you can either get a Churro or Churro + Ice-cream. Reasonably priced (~$4-$7). Small selection of flavors, where you can mix and match or ask for recommendation.

I tried just the churro mixed with oreo crumbs and condensed milk. I didn't even know you can mix the two flavors! The churro itself was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Be careful, it can be pretty hot as it's done right in front of you. The flavor itself was a little on the sweeter end, but that's expected. And it's a pretty large size - enough to share as a quick snack for two people.

I'll come back for sure to try their other flavors - and it's very hard to resist when it's aromatic as you walk around the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I've had PLENTY of Mexican churros at Kensington and around Harbourfront, but never a Korean churro. Never heard of this either and I'm Korean!

for $3.50 the original is quite big. Easily shared amongst 2 people and I eat alot! 

For those with a sweet tooth, you might not be happy as there is no caramel filling, but I assure you the Churro breading and dough is perfect.

I also recommend the ice cream, because it tastes really nice with the churro!

Haven't tried the glaze or other toppings, next time!

Been here 4 times already in the past 3 weeks...really good stuff!"}
{"text":"Korean-style churros! We got the special with chocolate glaze and almond topping. Crunchy shell with cakey centre and not too sweet - delicious!! The two young men that served us were genuinely nice! Good service..."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Fresh, yummy, cheap Korean style churros and the owner is always pleasant and friendly!
It's especially comforting after a few drinks!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about this place, I was a little apprehensive. Churros made by Koreans! What the heck?  As others reviews have mentioned, Mr. Chu is a little stall, in front of a Korean grocery store in the Yonge and Finch area in North York. If you are driving, there's a Green P parking nearby. 

There was no lineup on a Friday afternoon and we were able to order right away. Service was prompt and friendly. We ordered the Special Churro and Ice Cream combo for $7 each. There are different glaze and sprinkles that you can have on your churros. We got the chocolate glaze and the other one, we picked the condensed milk. We both had the Oreo sprinkles with vanilla ice cream. They are made on the spot. The churros were delicious and one of the best I ever had and that includes Spain and Latin America. I thought that the glaze will make it overly sweet but it didn't. The vanilla ice cream was very good too. Very rich and flavorful. 

I'm really happy that I tried this place! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is not even a full store and is hidden (well not hidden) but in the corner of the entrance to a convenience store.  

This is just my first impression and hope to come back to try this place again. I can see the potential of these churros and I genuinely enjoyed mine but there was no line, pretty hot out and the guy made it then and there so the oil might not have been hot enough and he told us 5 mins. The churro has like a doughiness to the centre of the churro (we were thinking it was probably raw in the middle, just a tiny bit though). 

I got condensed milk with Oreo in black sesame ice cream. My partner for just a matcha one. The matcha melted on the hot churro, was drippy and (if you've read my other reviews) didn't have a real matcha flavour, favouring the sweeter version of matcha flavouring. Condensed Mille with Oreo was good. Again like I said I have to try this place again when it's a little busier to see if the churros are meant to be this way or not. Even if it is I actually enjoyed the churro but not as crispy as your traditions churro. 

The sesame ice cream is full of sesame flavour but on the sweet side. The guy really packed it into the cup which is great but on a hot day I felt like a lost the bottoms fifth of the ice cream to melting. 

The price of you get with ice cream does ring up to like $9 and $4-6 regularly. Look out for a future review or an update to it."}
{"text":"I was searching through dessert places this summer and yelp suggested Mr. Chu's. Such a unique concept: Mexican-type churros with a Korean twist. We ordered the condensed milk churro with sprinkles and vanilla icecream. Previous photos made it look so delicious! But after eating it, we didn't really find it anything special, and we haven't been back since. 

I think that the menu and business has evolved and changed quite a bit since I visited (I hear there's more flavours), but these are some of the things we noticed when we went there...

1) The menu was a bit complicated to understand. There were a bunch of different options and it would have nice if it was an orderly menu. For example, Step 1) Pick the type of churro you want Step 2) Pick the toppings Step 3) Pick the icecream. 
2) When we were there, there were only two options for ice cream flavours: vanilla and chocolate. It would have nice to have more asian flavours, like green tea or sesame or red bean. We saw them scoop out the ice cream from typical large chapman brand bins (that was a bit disappointing).

The churro was quite tasty, but a little hard and actually cut the roof of my mouth. I think for the price ($7), I would have hope for something a little tastier."}
{"text":"These guys just opened and they are so friendly and I must say this is the best bang for buck when it comes to getting a Churro in  this city. I went here last weekend with my girlfriend and she got the special churro with condensed milk and chocolate sauce. The churros are crunchy or cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside like they should be."}
{"text":"I was here the other day and got a churro with condensed milk and Oreo crumble! It was delicious and fresh made, and the service was both quick and friendly. My only wish would be that the ice cream be switched to soft serve rather than scoops. Definitely a cute spot for a date or some late night dessert!"}
{"text":"Are you serious... yelpers!? If you've tried real churros once you wouldn't even give this place more than 2 stars. Ive had churros twice so I'd give it 1 star. Real churro is supposed to be crispy outside and soft and spongy inside, but your churro here, oh man, is firm inside, like dough! How can you call it churro!? If you didn't call it churro, I might think it tastes interesting and different but since you call it churro already, can you just make it a churro!?!? Like I don't understand the hard, doughy, firm texture of the long fried stick... I know it looks pretty and instagramable... but I learn substance over form at school and this churro is literally one of the best opposite illustrations in real life... 
me and two of my friends got the special one which costs around 5 dollar after tax (I don't remember..) three of us didn't even manage to finish one stick.. thanks to the amazing texture... -.- 
If you want a pretty picture, go for it but if you want something legit, I mean it's not churro, not even close..."}
{"text":"Mr. Chu is a cool little kiosk that offers fun, \"customizable\" Korean style churros! 

I came here with my girlfriend since she was visiting from out of town, and this was our second stop.

It's just a small food kiosk/food truck located right in front of a convenience store, so it may be a little easy to miss. We ordered their Oreo and condensed milk churro, and  we waited about 10 minutes. It was -16°c outside, but the wait was worth it! The condensed milk was warm and the inside of the churro was soft and chewy--delicious! 

I'll have to return to try another churro flavour with ice cream ($2 extra)!"}
{"text":"Churros vendor outside a korean convenience store at Yonge and Finch.

Churros are made-to-order hot and fresh. You can get a regular churros for $3.50, get it with some glaze and topping for $4.50, and/or dunked in ice cream for an extra $2.50 on top.

These are pretty big churros compared to the ones I've had in kensington.
A nice snack to pick up."}
{"text":"Say the hype & wanted to try. Sadly a disappointment - was not anything special. If anything ive had much better tasting churros in many other restaurants/ food stalls. Will not be returning ):"}
{"text":"One word: YUM! Mr. Chu's churros are freshly made and delicious! I visited their truck on a quiet Thursday afternoon and their customer service is 10/10! The guy working there was very attentive and came to ask for my order right as I stood at the window (he was working on kneading dough when I arrived). Although there was a slight wait (just under 5 minutes) for my order to be made, it was totally worth it!

I ordered their Condensed Milk glaze with almonds churro ($4.50). The churro was warm and the texture of the dough was not too tough. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I found that they have black sesame on the inside of the churro, which is quite unique. It balanced out the sweetness of the churro!

I especially enjoyed the bottom bit of the churro as there was a generous sprinkling of the cinnamon sugar. I'm not usually a huge fan of cinnamon so this amount was good!

I am definitely coming back to try their regular churros ($3.50) and their ice cream with churros ($6.00)."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this was my first churro experience - let alone a Korean one? Was looking for a dessert/snack spot after lunch and stumbled upon this food stall along Finch, around 2pm on a Sunday. It is a bit hidden under a building, but if you find a Subway and Coco, you're in the right spot. There was one  person running the stall, and we ordered 2 original churros to share with 3 people. One other customer was ahead of us. The wait seemed a bit long but I saw that each one was made fresh, so I was okay with that. 

The churros were covered with cinnamon sugar and were slightly crispy on the outside. It was hot and soft on the inside, and was a light treat in general. The service is what really made this such a pleasant experience for me - ESPECIALLY AT A FOOD STALL. When we received our churros, the nice guy working the stall said that our churros came out a bit thinner than normal, and ended up giving an extra one (one per person)!! Definitely did not expect that gesture, especially considering the \"thinner\" sized churros were already quite big.     

Value wise I think the prices are quite reasonable, with originals running at $3.50, toppings $4.50, with the option to add ice cream for $2.50 extra. The person ahead of us got the ice cream option and it actually looked quite good (pretty much a full tall cup of ice cream with the churro). Will return to try the topping and ice cream options in the future!"}
{"text":"I didn't know Korean churros were a thing! I had to Google this just to verify I wasn't being fooled by two Korean Millennials running a food stall...  Turns out Korean churros are indeed a thing, popularized in South Korea 5 or so years ago, now making their way to Toronto! 

Mr. Chu is a small food stall tucked away right beside the entrance of a Korean convenience store. $4.50 will get you a churo will two tasty toppings. First is a glaze and then you apply a topping. Apparently condensed milk + Oreo bits is the best seller. We had this and chocolate + almonds. I found the chocolate + almond combo was better, but both were very tasty. Their churros are done well - not oily, portion is rather large, not too dense and moist on the inside!  Also, ice cream can be added for another $2.50!

If tasty flavours are not your thing (shame on you!), you can opt for regular which is basically cinnamon sugar. This sets you back $3.50.

This place is great! The way street snacks should be! Who doesn't like fried dough, seriously? Also make sure to top off your glutton fest with a bubble tea from Coco next door!"}
{"text":"Good churro spot! Mr.Chu is a small stall right in front of a convenience store on finch. My churro came out fresh and hot. I got the condensed milk with sprinkles and my friend got the condensed milk with oreos ($4.50 each). The churro itself is bigger than the average churro I have ever eaten

Nice crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. These are great if you are craving something sweet that's quite easy to eat. Lots of customizable options and they also have it with ice cream. 

Friendly service and they accept card too! I'd come back if I'm in the area to try their other flavours"}
{"text":"Amazing churros. It was nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Definitely a place I would come back to if I was craving a churro. It was a bit too big for me though so if I came back I'd split it with someone since the taste does get pretty repetitive. 

They also sell giant cotton candy bigger than your face which is what initially caught my attention but they only make it if it's sunny outside and not raining or very windy and unfortunately I missed out since it was windy. I'll 100% be back for it!!"}
{"text":"For a gal who goes to and fro from Finch Station for work five days a week, Mr. Chu is salvation in an aromatic, crispy dough fritter!  It's very easy to miss this stall.  However, simply make your way behind the new ssam KBBQ restaurant underneath Soban Cafe and head towards the convenience store next to the Subways and Co Co. Conveniently located within a 1 minute walk from the station as well as next to popular joints like Huh Ga Ne, Mr. Chu will give you the perfect churros for dessert or as a treat for surviving another day at work. 

Stop before you mix these up with any other churro.  These are a tier above what you can often find at tourist sites in downtown or at Kensington Market.  The churros at Mr. Chu are unique in the sense that they can be jazzed up with various glazes and toppings on top of the usual cinnamon and sugar coating. You can choose one glaze and one topping here.  For glazes, you can select chocolate, cream cheese, or condensed milk.  You can then top it off with peanuts, almonds, granola, sprinkles, or oreo crumbles.  If you're even more adventurous, you can have the vendor plant your giant churro into a bed of soft serve ice cream, creating a churro sundae.  Snapping a shot for instagram or your other social media outlets is a must!

The vendor recommended me to get the condensed milk glaze topped with oreo crumble.  It's the most popular combination, he claims.  It really knocked my socks off!  Not only was it very aromatic, as the churros are made fresh right in front of the customer, the flavour was phenomenal.  The regular cinnamon and sugar coating blended well with the sweetness of the milk and the darker flavour of the oreo bits.  It was heavenly!  Also, despite being a fried food, its texture was crispy and light in a way that didn't make your stomach churn from the oil.  Price to portion-wise, Mr. Chu stands at the top.  The churros are cheaply priced like other similar products found elsewhere, but its trump cards are the toppings and the size.  You can get a snazzy selfie-worthy churro for double the size of what you can find south of Finch.

I will definitely be coming back - hopefully the vendor can make me a colourfully striped churro with sprinkles!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not the dessert type.. but this place wow'ed me. I like how this stand was tucked neatly into the corner of the convenience store. I think walking by, that was the first thing I noticed. It was big and yellow, really stood out (no, yellow is not my favourite colour  lol) Wife ordered the churro alone without icecream as last night was quite cold. She ordered the churro with condensed milk and oreo crumbles.. it was absolutely delicious! The texture was awesome, very crisp and crunchy but soft on the inside. I'd definitely be back when I'm down by Yonge and Finch.. next time WITH ICE CREAM ZOMG!

Also, thank you for the kind service! Bless your soul for standing there in the cold selling this awesome delicacy!"}
{"text":"An interesting concept, definitely IG worthy. It is a bit steep in price for what is offered, although, I am glad to have tried it. Disclosure: this a popular food cart and waiting is required. The \"Korean: churro is denser than their Latin counterpart. It's pretty much a meal on its own if you have a small appetite. To explain, you could buy the original or special churro (it comes with one - disregard the picture on the menu)...you can upgrade to add chocolate or vanilla ice cream. When you order the special you get a choice of one glaze and one topping to mix and match. 

The choices were simple once you've read through the menu board. Personally, I would skip their chapman style ice and go directly to the star of the show which are the churros. We were lucky to get 'em fresh and right out of the fryer...but the wait was a tad long. The batter was crispy outside and dense inside...paired with the topping was good. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about.   

Pricey but a change of pace in dessert. Worth the try..."}
{"text":"Normally, I am not a huge fan of churros. But this one was tasty, it's not too sweet and it has a good texture. Not too thick.

You can pick from condensed milk, chocolate, and toppings such as almond or Oreo.

It is a stand outside of the convenient store, so it is good to stop by after a take out bubble tea.

Will come back to try different flavours!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Mr. Chu. Pretty much tried every different combination on their menu."}
{"text":"After hearing many good things about this place, finally got to try it! Small shop next to a grocery. Was a bit hard to find while driving. 
Got the condensed milk + oreo as many have recommened and that didn't disappoint! The icecream had good vanilla flavour, but I wished it was soft served. Note: The wait could be a bit long (10 min) on a chilly night."}
{"text":"I walk by Mr.Chu everyday coming from work or the gym.  It's about a 3 min walk from Yonge & Finch / Finch station and is conveniently beside a bubble tea place (Coco) to complement the churros or some Korean restaurants so you can munch on something sweet after getting lunch or dinner. The yellow mini food truck is hard to miss. Usually busy around lunch or dinner times but never more than a 10-15 minute wait when it gets extremely busy.

Food *****
Mr.Chu is all about Korean churros, a unique taste and style compared to other churros places found in Kesington Market. You get a great bang for your buck as portions are pretty big and filling for the price you pay ($3.50). You can add 1 glaze (chocolate, cream cheese, condensed milk) + 1 topping (almonds, oreo crumble, sprinkles) for $1 more or add vanilla/chocolate ice cream for an extra $2.50. These churros, while sweet, don't feel overly greasy and provides a soothing balance of taste. 

Service *****
Jack and Jun are the two cool dudes that run Mr.Chu and they always provide a personal, friendly service with some laughs and a smile. I'm always happy to strike up a quick chat with them if I past by and it's not so busy.

Ambiance **
It's a food truck, so no seating besides some benches nearby.

Tips/Closing comments
- Definitely get the toppings for $1 more (condensed milk + oreo crumble is my fave)
- Mr.Chu is a unique and delicious Korean churro place  that you should definitely try if you're near Yonge & Finch and you are craving something sweet and unique"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 + but not quite yet at 4. 

For the price of 3.50 flat fee for a decently sized churro, Mr. Chu offered a soft but slightly dense churro. After eating the whole thing I found myself wanting to cleanse my palate. The inside was nice and soft and the outside fried to crisp, but it was denser than usual to my liking. Might be because of how the centre was not hollowed out. There was a lot of cinnamon sugar covering the churro so maybe that also contributed to the need for water.

Overall would go back. Not sure how it'll be with the toppings and ice cream but worth a try!"}
{"text":"The guy who works there is always happy and friendly. Been here multiple times and never disappointed. The absolute best place to get black sesame ice cream. My go to dessert place when im in the area"}
{"text":"Mr. Chu is a small food cart outside the convenience store around Yonge and Finch. It's really great if you're craving something sweet and Instagram worthy :) The wait is a little long, but it's understandable and the guy that was working when I ordered was really nice and gave me paper bags to carry the churros in (I ordered four for my family and I). 
I ordered the original churros and then two specialty churros, chocolate almond and sprinkles. They are really delicious, but really sweet for my taste but my family absolutely loved them, so.... Overall a nice dessert/treat :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Love the churro toppings. Condensed milk on anything is always a plus. However for the price I pay, I wish the ice cream would be something fancier instead of store bought ice cream. There's usually a wait because the churros are made fresh to order."}
{"text":"I only tried their to-go when my family got one to home. It was okay but not a best quality and I thought it must taste better if I eat while it is still warm, right after I ordered. So I tried to give a go and found out they didn't open on time they supposed to open. It made me feel so bad when I spent time and tired an effort to go to the place when the weather is not good. I wish they update their information if they don't open what they written on google or yelp."}
{"text":"Super cute churro stand beside the Korean supermarket at Yonge and finch. It's gonna be poppin, nowhere else in Toronto have I found this. 

First- I love Mexican churros. Churros are my thang. 
THESE ARE KOREAN STYLE CHURROS AND THEY ARE DELICIOUSO. there's nothing I hate more than food that is instagram-beautiful but tastes like the devils vomit. That is not the case for this baby. These Korean churros are unique, look beautiful and taste like gorgeousness. 

They have lots of toppings- nuts, Oreos, sprinkles etc. They're delicious. You can also choose to have it with ice cream. Ugh, I wish I could get that. 

This is a great spot for yummy street food. $3-7 so definitely not a bad price for a quick snack. 

Also the guy working the stand is super sweet and nice. So adorbs."}
{"text":"The place can be easily missed as it it located right in front of the convenience store, Joy Mart.  We tried the Ice Cream + Special Churro (vanilla ice cream with condensed milk glaze and oreo toppings).  

The churros are made to order so it always comes to you fresh but you do need to wait a bit.  The vanilla ice cream was average.  If you do plan to check this place out then just order the churros."}
{"text":"We finally made it to North York and did a mini food crawl there, but we also picked the coldest & windiest day to do so o.o the wind was literally pushing us when we were walking and it started raining too (yes what better day to be walking outdoors right?) But I am so happy to finally get to try the popular Mr.Chu! The store is just a trailer beside a Korean Supermarket but I am sure you won't miss it because of its bright yellow colour! The churros are freshly made so we had to stand in the cold to wait but at the end it was all well worth it!! FYI you can call them in advanced to pre-order!

The churro was crunchy outside and soft inside (????) and you cannot go wrong with the classic combination of almond & chocolate!!  Such a hearty snack to warm up our hands (& souls) while walking to our next location xD
Cannot wait to go back again!
 Churro
(Chocolate Glazed with Almond Topping)"}
{"text":"I felt it's average for churros. Nothing spectacular but a good hit for street food dessert.  Pricey for a churro I find"}
{"text":"Little pricey for what it is but it's still delicious. It takes roughly 10mins to be prepared. I personally recommend oreo + condensed milk + almond combination"}
{"text":"Came here to try their icecream churro with their new cotton candy.  They have a tiny booth around Yonge and finch.   I got the churro with condensed milk and almonds , it was a little sweet but perfectly done.  The black sesame icecream was good but I love black sesame anything and for an extra $2 got the little side of cotton candy which was fun, but it was a tad windy for cotton candy.   Next time i think I'll opt for a giant cotton candy cloud for $5 cuz it's positively massive!"}
{"text":"This is the best churro place in Toronto, hands down. I've tried places from Kensington market and food festivals. But this place has got the texture, crispiness, and sweetness perfectly.

I always get the original and then some new flavour I haven't tried before. I've yet to be disappointed. This is a must try if you like churros."}
{"text":"I've never actually had real churros before so I can't really make a comparison, but this Korean churro was sooo good, my boyfriend approves haha. 

It a small stall by Yonge and Finch. It's next to Coco if that helps, because the place itself was easy to miss. 

I got the dressed up churro which came with one glaze and one topping for $4.50. I chose condensed milk with sprinkles and the churros are made to order. 

What surprised me was hot big it was! When I first bit into to it was hot but the outside was crispy and the inside had a soft, chewy texture which I love. It really reminds me of eating the cinnamon twist from Taco Bell (but better, haha).

I can see myself coming here to try out some of the other combinations."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of churros then this place is a must. Personally I'm not really a huge fan of churros but my gf really wanted to check it out. After having dinner at Huh Ga Ne we ended up checking out the booth and ordered an almond churro with black sesame ice cream. Something about having their churros with their ice cream just ended up tasting amazing. Apparently the ice cream they serve with their churros is imported from Japan and I felt like it tasted really good with the churro we ordered. For someone who really isn't into churros this place definitely opened my eyes to them."}
{"text":"I saw all the posts so I had to try it out for myself. 
This place is a cart located on Finch on the south-west corner. The churros are made to order. So far, there's only a few toppings to pick from, which there was more. Missing the obvious ones like powdered sugar and bacon bits. I'd rate it closer to 3.5 stars because I've had better churros at places downtown. This one here is on the denser side. And there's no where to sit to enjoy it. The classic one with brown sugar needs more cinnamon and the almonds would be way better if they were roasted almonds. The price is reasonable, because of its density, it feels a bit filling. Overall I think it's good. There's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have never heard of Korean style churros before this place came onto the scene. Now I do, and I really really like them! This place is easy to spot and easy to get to, it's not only just a few steps from Finch Station, but it's a bright yellow so you can't miss it. Korean churros have different ingredients compared to traditional churros. The flavours of ice cream they serve are vanilla, chocolate, black sesame and others. I recommend getting the churro with any glaze and topping you want plus ice cream, that way you can get/try everything! \"Chu\"se wisely (I love puns)! The people I've seen run the stand are nice, friendly and polite (Hi Joon! lol), so it makes for a pleasant ordering experience. The only downside is that you don't really have a lot of options to sit, unless you want to sit on concrete lol. It's more of a dessert on the go place, but it's still worth going to because you experience something unique and delicious in Toronto! Check it out :3"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the special churro. We got churro + condensed milk + Oreo topping + matcha ice cream. If I were to order again, probably won't order the ice cream. Churro is very soft and tasty, but ice cream is just regular matcha ice cream you get at the AYCE sushi place, nothing special."}
{"text":"Korean churros? What's that? Delicious, that's what!

This was the second to last stop on our food crawl and nothing was what I expected. First of all, Mr. Chu's is just a little cart on wheels set up in front of a convenience store.

We ordered a churro dipped in chocolate and coated with almonds. Sounds simple but it was amazing! The texture, the flavours, were all perfectly in harmony. I could have eaten more but...

I have to mention that my dear companion dropped half of OUR churro on the ground when she was breaking it to share. Had I known how good it was going to taste, I would have said that was her half!

I'll be back and I won't be sharing!"}
{"text":"The bright yellow truck stall was easy to find - Hello, Sunshine! 

We ordered the Specials: Chocolate Glaze with Peanut Toppings, and Matcha Glaze with Almonds. 

The young men working inside the stall informed us it would take about 15 mins to be ready. If you pay with cash you can pass the tax fees, but debit will charge. Both guys wore cute Mr. Chu black hoodies...would recommend selling merchandise in the future :) 

It was chilly outside but that didn't stop a handful of us waiting around for our churros. 

We were so excited to finally bite into our churros, and were not disappointed. The outside was crispy and covered with sugar and cinnamon along with our special toppings. Inside dough had black speckles and was chewy. The chewiness reminded me of donuts back in Japan - similar to mochi-texture. I'm glad to find a place that sells something similar to it in Canada! 

It can get a little messy with the extra toppings... Recommend grabbing a couple of napkins. 

Will definitely be back to try the other flavours. 

Secret recipe is Korean. Best churros I've had yet - YUM."}
{"text":"Mr. Chu is a nice, inexpensive snack that hits the spot - just under $5! It's a food truck located just west of Finch and Yonge (on Finch) and it's bright yellow so it's easy to find.

A Korean friend told me that the difference between regular churros and Korean ones is that they use glutinous rice flour - to be honest I didn't taste much difference so not sure how much they use? But this was delicious anyway! It comes out piping hot as it is freshly made and is a little difficult to hold because it's so tall. I got Nutella with sprinkles but you can get it with condensed milk, oreo, and almonds as well. You can also get it with ice cream (which I will try next time) but it was delicious in and of itself as well. 

The guys who work there were also super friendly and helpful while explaining how the ordering process worked. I'll definitely have this again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious churros! I got one with condensed milk and almonds -- lovely combination. The churros are fresh and perfectly textured: crispy on the outside and soft inside. They also seem to be a bit different from traditional churros, but in a good way! The churros are pretty big -- can easily be split by two or three people.

We also availed ourselves of the giant cotton candy; what fun! Cotton candy is cotton candy, but it was a fun photo-op!"}
{"text":"Great Churros and fast service! Love coming here for late night eats! They have so many mix and match options. You can also get ice cream with the churro as well if your craving for something sweet. Each order is made fresh every time I've gone there and the wait to pick up is not to bad 

My personal favourite include the original flavour! I love the crunchiness of the churro. Also, the chocolate glazed is great if you want a really sweet one. The condensed milk was more creamy then sweet. All are really great 

Will definitely be coming back to try more options! The prices do not hurt the pocket which is great. Super cute to upload on your social media too!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to Coco's when I ran into this place and being the enterprising person I am when it comes to new experiences, I decided to try this place out. This place offers Korean Style Churros with a variety of drizzles and toppings. I had my churro with condensed milk as my drizzle and Oreos as my topping. Without trying to sound too aggressive, this had to be the best churro I've ever had. It wasn't too crispy nor was it too soft; it was just perfect. Paired with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, it was a match made in heaven. I would highly recommend you try this place out!"}
{"text":"visit Mrchu last night to try the korean style churro! Great food and service from staff and loved it! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Located right at the corner of Yonge & Finch in front of a little convenience store. 

For $5, you can get your choice of sauce (Condensed milk, matcha, chocolate, dulce de leche) and toppings (Oreo, almond, peanuts, sprinkles, etc) for the churros. I got a churro with matcha sauce and sprinkles. The churros are all made fresh to order so be prepared to wait a little bit for them cus they're worth the wait! Matcha sauce is really good, has a nice tea flavour. The churros are crispy, soft on the inside, and not overly oily.

My only quibble is that the matcha sauce was too runny so it was dripping everywhere and made it a bit messy to eat.

Overall, the taste of the fresh churros were really good and love how they're freshly made! 

FYI, there wasn't anyone inside the truck when we went (probably because it was a really cold afternoon), but pop into the convenience store and someone will come out to make your churros!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Mr. Chu! Their churros are made fresh to order, giving you a warm and crunchy snack/dessert. You can mix and match the glaze and toppings, along with ice-cream if you're up for it. My favourite glazes are matcha and condensed milk, and my favourite toppings are almonds and Oreo. So if you're a churros fanatic like me, you've got to hit up Mr. Chu!"}
{"text":"En route to Coco's after an interesting meal, saw this little pop up shop in front of a convenience store and it seemed to good to miss.
This place makes fresh churros, you can choose your own glaze and toppings.
What made it more exciting was the fact that their prices were on the lower end and these kind of shops are only visible in events.
Quick service and good location for students and close to the GO Finch station!"}
{"text":"The hype is true, about Mr. Chu
I was in the mood, for some food
Satisfied my sweet tooth, from that booth
They became my hero, with a churro

That's how much I enjoyed my condensed milk with almond churro and black sesame ice cream that's apparently imported from Japan... I wrote a poem about it!"}
{"text":"Mmmm Mr. Chu makes some delicious churros! After seeing all the hype online, we went and checked this place out. This place definitely lives up to the hype! We got the almond covered with condensed milk churro ($4.50) and original ($3.50). They were delicious - super soft inside but crunchy exterior. I liked the almond churro best! It's located pretty close by to finch station. Highly recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, no long wait, great price. Would reccomend getting with toppings. Prices you see included tax. Tip if you like taking food photos and/or selfies : the churro makes a great frame for photos of your friends or selfie haha"}
{"text":"Cute hidden spot near yonge and finch. It's not really a store and not really a food stand, it's more like a food stand stock into a wall. 

Everyone on Yelp was raving about the churros so I got the original to try out. It's definitely the best churros I've ever had. It's crispy and crunchy, and the inside is fluffy and soft. The guy who works there also wrote down the # to call so they can make it ahead of time. If you don't, the wait is about 2-3 minutes. Not too long if you're the only customer, but I can imagine it getting a bit hectic if there's a long line up. 

Need to be back to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"Location/Service:

Finally got the chance to visit this truck. It is located outside a small Korean convenience store, next to Coco Tea House and an awesome Korean restaurant - Huh Ga Ne. It is only steps from the Finch subway station! I came by on a very cold (-10C) winter weeknight at 6pm and to no surprise, there was no line up. The menu was quite extensive and thank God that I read the menu online and decided on what I wanted to order before going there because I wouldn't want to stand there in the cold. The guy behind the trunk (make sure you knock the window because he tends to hide to the side) was very nice and quick and gave me my order in less than 5 minutes when he told me to wait for 10 minutes. 

Food:
I ordered the Korean style churros with sliced almonds and condensed milk  matcha ice cream ($9.5 tax in). The churro was huge and was VERY good! I really like the texture and the taste of it. I have had the ones in Korea before and this sure tasted like it! The sweetness was perfect for me and it wasn't oily (which is a big bonus for me!) The ice cream, on the other hand, was just okay. It tasted just like the ice cream that you can buy from the grocery store. It wasn't anything special. I wish it was soft served though. However, I like how they added extra almond slices/pieces to my icecream to \"top it off\" and not just have it on the churro. 

Overall, I would order the churro again ($5+tax) but not sure about pairing it with ice cream. The price is quite expensive for something like this when the ice cream isn't really special. The churro is especially tasty when it is super cold outside. With the warmth of the churro, it sure makes my stomach so warm and fuzzy :) It would also be great if there was a little (heated) seating area for people to enjoy after they purchase. For the most part, people just stand around the vicinity of the truck..."}
{"text":"I just tried their matcha churro with granola topping and black sesame ice cream! Loved it, the ice cream was very creamy and flavourful, the churro was warm crunchy and had a nice density (chew factor) 

My only reason for giving 4/5 is because it's super messy to eat and the price of $9 (it's reasonable but still pricey) 

Also the matcha sauce was underwhelming and got lost in the black sesame flavour, also the sauce is a little runny and thin"}
{"text":"I got chocolate icecream with special churros. The icecream didn't taste that special. It just tasted like icecream from supermarkets, a bit under average. However, the churros were really good. They were warm, topped with chocolate sauce and Oreos. Not bad !"}
{"text":"I love churros and mr. Chu does them perfectly! Got the special churro (cream cheese + oreo) with chocolate ice cream for $7.50. 

That combination was delicious. Churro is light and fluffy, done very well. Crispy on the outside just like a churro should be. Bf, who usually doesn't like the desserts I order, ate over half of this. 

I was scared it would be too sweet, but they don't sweeten their cream cheese frosting, giving it a nice tangy flavour.

Chocolate ice cream was also surprisingly good! Next time I would probably only order the special churro for $4.50 since the churro+ice cream is $7.50.

It's located at Yonge and Finch by the Subway/Coco. Service is fast and friendly. Can't wait to try some more flavours!"}
{"text":"I chu and I chu, but it's still just aiiiiiiight. 

The churro itself is large, but the flavour of the churro is average at best. It doesn't really taste like a traditional churro, more like a modest impression. The ice cream is just tub ice cream and that of a lower quality, but it did make the overall snack a little better."}
{"text":"I was debating between a 4, 4.5, or possibly even 5... then I realized that my favourite churros come from Chicago (Xoco by Rick Bayless) and San Diego (A little bakery).  Mr. Chu can stand up right along side them easily and if a small tiny little metal food truck/cart on Finch can compete with a 1 star Michelin chef for a fraction of the price, then yea... 5 stars!

Funny thing is that I came here after my disaster and a half at Playa Cabana and was still thinking I haven't scratched that Mexican craving itch.  Well, Mr. Chu not only scratched that itch ... it's got me craving for more.  If I can head over to this 'school bus' yellow tiny cart every day, I would be a happy snacker.  So for anyone trying to find this place, it is not a build, store, or a cart in a store.  It literally is a small tin cube plunked outside a grocery store right beside CoCo boba tea. 

For the price, you really can't get a fresher and better treat in Toronto.  For only $3.50, you can get a very big cinnamon sugared churro.  For only $1 more, you can get a drizzle and a topping of any type.  There's also an option of adding ice cream but I'm gonna be honest, it's cold in Canada 8 months of the year.  I wasn't feeling ice cream ... I was feeling windchill.

Churro with drizzle and topping - it is so hard to do a good churro. Mr. Chu got it down right ... crispy bordering on crunchy shell, soft fluffy interior, and not oily.  Though I love a good Mexican chocolate sauce to dip it into, I was quite happy with the options here.  Condensed milk was a nice creamy sticky mess to keep whatever topping you'd want on the stick.  I chose their most popular option of crushed Oreos with condensed milk and really liked it.  Hot crispy dough smothered in a creamy sweet milk with a coating of lightly bitter chocolately Oreos.  Loved it! 5/5

It's not often you find a hidden gem but I'll give full credit to the other reviews for helping discover this one!"}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for a dessert place on yelp and came across Mr.Chu with high ratings, so I decided to give it a try. It is a small stall in front of a convenience store. The churros are made fresh by order. I ordered their special chocolate glaze and almond topping churro. It was delicious, not overly sweet with a hint of cinnamon. It was light and crispy, just the way I like it. If I am in the area again I will definitely like to come back and try the other flavours."}
{"text":"Never thought there would be a Korean style churros. I'm actually not a fan of authentic churros cause I don't like cinnamon, but I'm a fan of this Korean style churros. $3.50 for original, or $4.50 to add a glaze and topping. I had it with condensed milk and Oreo crumbs. Was really tasty! The outside was nice and crispy but slightly soft inside. Love condensed milk, was a perfect combo with the Oreo crumbs. When you get to the very bottom is where I could really taste the cinnamon sugar since the glaze and toppings don't get all the way to the bottom. Really good size for it's price. A great grab and go kind of snack!

P.S. the owner is Mr. Park, not Mr. Chu"}
{"text":"A delicious snack or dessert any time of day! They should put up a sandwich board right at the Yonge/finch intersection with coloured pictures (not like the black illustrations on the food stand) and an arrow. They are missing lots of potential customers!!! They should also consider sellling coffee or hot chocolate, esp in the winter. Good luck Mr. Chu!!"}
{"text":"Am I the only one who made an Apink reference to this? Haha anyways, I remember hearing this place opening but at that time, I was not really a fan of churros so I dismissed it and passed by it so many times. One day my friend and I decided to try and dang, I really should have given this place a chance earlier because these churros were REALLY good! It also came with good service so no complaints there. The size of churro came with a good price as it was super filling. Ever since, I have been going back and getting a churro whenever I'm craving one of these. So overall, it's made to order, super customizable and delicious."}
{"text":"Where in the World is Mr Chu? Mr Chu must have a late night as he did not show up for work till 3:45 pm instead of the posted 3 pm. 

Lucky for him, his Churros are so tasty and I forgave him the moment I had my first bite!

Chocolate and Almond ($5) - Crunchy outside and soft bread like inside with a touch of Cinnamon and Sugar

I can eat that everyday."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for some delicious churros. We got the condensed milk glaze with the Oreo crumble and it was soooo good. It wasn't overly sweet. There can be a bit of a wait because it takes about 5 minutes to get it ready. Thankfully we were there when there was no line because shortly after 3 more people showed up."}
{"text":"Tried the condensed milk with Oreo and vanilla ice cream. It's pretty good indeed, out of my expectation. The portion is big with 3 scoops of ice cream. But actually don't think I will try again."}
{"text":"Yasss!! 

It was -22°C, i waited outside in the cold with my boyfriend to get a churro. Face was numb, but totally worth it. 

3,50$ for a regular churro (boring!) 
4:50$ for a churro that has a sauce and a topping. I got the condensed milk + Oreo. So good!!!! I could eat 10 of those in a heartbeat! (Might be my last heartbeat though, they're quite rich!) 

It's just delicious. Nothing else to add. You can add ice cream for 2 extra dollars and toppings on the ice cream for another 50 cents. 

Delicious, 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on our vacation after dinner at a spot around the corner and got the Korean style churro with chocolate icecream, dipped in condensed milk and with sprinkles. It wasn't too much so we both loved it. The guys working were very nice and fast in making our delicious dessert. Definitely a great end to our night. I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area!"}
{"text":"Tiny food stand near the corner of Yonge and Finch that serve Korean-style churros. These confectionaries differ from traditional latin churros by including ingredients such as rice, barley and sesame into the dough batter. The end product is a pastry that tastes mostly like a classic churro, but with a noticeable wheat-like flavour and texture at the end. 

I ordered their special condensed milk and Oreo cookie glazed churro for $4.50. This was the most popular combination that was recommended by the staff. It was made ready to order, and tasted like a delicious chocolate churro! The portion was pretty good too; I think you could split it between 2 people and still feel satisfied =) 

Overall, if you love churros, you'll be happy to know that you can get some good ones in this neighborhood as well now. They make a decent alternative to the usual bubble tea for desert in this area."}
{"text":"Great dessert! Finally checked this place out after seeing pictures from Instagram - I was not disappointed. 

I got the black sesame ice cream with the chocolate and almond covered churro. The churros were made very well and the contrast of the crunchy churro with the ice cream was heavenly. There are a variety of different flavour combinations you can choose from - you can choose the ice cream, the churro glaze, and the churro topping. There's definitely a flavour combination for everyone. The employees are super friendly and are very happy to explain how everything works. I definitely recommend this place if you're craving something sweet!"}
