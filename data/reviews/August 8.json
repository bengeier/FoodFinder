{"text":"Do not go for dim sum, I tried custurd bun, beef tribe, curry squid, shimp dumpings, meh, nothing tasted right. On the other hand, their sushi was decent, I especially liked their tempura, it was very crunchy and overly greasy. Rolls and sushi was your normal AYCE quality, no suprises. I will go again for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Not the best Sushi place I have eaten at since it's all you can eat and when it's all you can eat things can get carried away like too much food and too much dessert. But it's a nice location and it has very friendly employees."}
{"text":"I come here regularly but the customer service was extremely poor this time. They brought a seaweed salad out to us with a long hair sticking out of it. When we told our waiter he laughed and brought another salad. Appetite was already ruined by this time. Neither my friend nor i enjoyed the rest of the meal and barely ate any. At the end of the day, the server did not acknowledge or apologize for the mistake. The food that was ordered never reached the table. Huge no for me. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore August 8!  This location has incredible customer service, gorgeous decor and most importantly delicious food!  I cannot say enough good about this place!! Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"My favourite pan-Asian AYCE.  Have tried their locations in Hamilton and Oakville as well... same top notch quality food in all locations.  Dim sums were delicious, sashimi was fresh, rolls were nice as well.  Their barbecued skewered chicken and beef were yummy.  Spicy seafood udon soup was flavourful.  Would definitely return.  Have already rec'd this place to many friends"}
{"text":"August 8 is conveniently located inside of Bramalea City Centre so I decided to try it out for lunch. I also heard that they served dim sum as well so I was curious because the only other dim sum restaurant in Brampton is Kingsley.

The interior of the restaurant was nice. It was quite busy for lunch time but I managed to get a seat in a booth. It's an AYCE menu that is ordered through iPads so there isn't that much service going on. 

Continuing onto the service... It was not the greatest. Our drinks were not refilled even when dishes were cleared, the servers did not glance to see if the waters were empty, which they were. The food came out really fast though, so if you have limited time but want to eat AYCE this is a good place.

On to the food. The sushi is decent. The hand rolls are tasty, especially the spicy scallop hand roll. The dim sum on the other hand was not that good. It tasted like dim sum you buy frozen at the grocery store and defrost later to eat. 

Overall, it is an alright place. I would go back because it is again conveniently located inside of the mall. The food is decent. The servers were nice, but I wished they were more attentive towards details."}
{"text":"I went on Tuesday all u can eat food is great paid $14 senior discount I only ate sea food"}
{"text":"Ive been to this August 8 location about 5 times.

The first time I went the service was okay.  Every single time after that the service after every visit declined tremendously. 

What led me to leave an actual review, is that this past weekend, my bf and I had by far the worst service. 

When we were seated at our table, no one had come to ask us what we would like to drink for at least 10 min despite workers running the food. 

My bf also usually orders ONLY steak teriyaki and rice.  We ordered, but his food came about 50 min after.  Even things from our 2nd order came before that.  

Our ipad also stopped working, (had issues previous visits with wi-fi) but getting a server to help us out was ridiculous as no one was making eye contact for us to flag them down. When we finally had someones attention, he took the ipad and returned only for it to not even fixed. And had to yet again wait long for someone to help us out.

When it was finally fixed, we then reordered the steak teriyaki and then finally complained about some \"forgotten\" dishes that we never received. And my bf finally got to eat after 15 min putting in a second order.

The only this that was okay about our meal, was the green tea icecream.

Even requesting the bill took forever as there was no one looking up again.

All in all, the OAKVILLE LOCATION is by far more SUPERIOR in service.  I will be visiting that location from now on even though the drive is further than bramalea."}
{"text":"Waited for 20 minutes for food that when I finally got it, the sushi was cold. 
It didn't taste that great, it felt like the eel was left overs from someone else's meal, from yesterday that was put in the fridge. 

The servers were very nice however and were very apologetic for the wait time. 
Also they have free wifi so that helped distracted me from the not so great sushi! 

For a place that looks fancy, they don't really make food that great which was the biggest disappointment."}
{"text":"Good food but when I went with my friend, she ordered a drink and the glass was covered in salt! She couldn't even drink it because it was so disgusting. The food was a lot better and the service was decent."}
{"text":"We visited this place earlier this week. It's one of the more decent AYCE sushi joints in Oakville. The host and most of the servers are friendly, but avoid the Asian guy with a slight ponytail-he comes off as rude (forgetting to bring drinks, banging plates/glasses) and for the price you pay, brings down the service rating.

As far as food goes, the sashimi is fresh and teppanyaki (chicken and beef) are well cooked and well marinated. Dim sum is okay, but you're better off ordering from their sushi list. Also avoid take out and a la carte, this place is great if you're looking for a buffet of food as it is better served fresh."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a large group of people and both service & food were great!  

Highlights:
- accommodating with seating half of the group first and then quickly setting up the next table for reining group
- food ordered was brought out relatively quickly. No wait time
- food was tasty and portion size was roughly 5-6 pieces per dish"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for lunch. The interactive way to order is a great idea using the iPads at the tables. Service is quick and tasty and reasonably priced for lunch (2 guest, $45 approx.) buffet.

Diet coke did not taste good at all as it was watered down or tasted like with was half mixed with flat ginger ale or something. Other than that, this was a great restaurant and a great experience and I will always consider for lunch and would like to try for dinners also going forward."}
{"text":"The restaurant decorations were elegant, really enjoyed the environment and atmosphere. 

The food was pretty good, well decorated in cute plates. Dimsum was alright, not as good as their sushi in my opinion. Their beef mushroom rolls were DELICIOUS ! They put an asparagus inside which made the roll crunchy and tasty. Highly recommended!   

The only con I would say is the price lol. I've been to many AYCE sushi places, this one is probably one of the most expensive restaurants. We went there for lunch on Tuesday, it was $16. And I believe it's gonna be around $30 for weekend dinner? I understand why it's kinda expensive, but it's a little bit pricey for people like me who have sushi every weekend lol. 

Anyway, I had a good time at this restaurant, hope y'all will like it too!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers that say middle of the road. The quality is not great- they have a good menu and as with many ayce the sashimi is not worth it, small pieces and for the most part lacking a lot of flavor. Rolls can have a tendency to fall apart and you won't get large pieces of fish on your rainbow roll or red dragon rolls. The beef was better then I expected. But seems pricey for the quality if you go for a weekend dinner. No way I could give more than 3 stars. service is quick and everyone is pleasant."}
{"text":"While the food is mediocre, the service is absolutely terrible. The last time I went here I was awaiting to be acknowledged by a server because the iPad was not functioning ! It actually took about 30 minutes for a server to even approach my table. The server was a blonde girl who did not even apologize after I stated that I have been waiting half an hour for someone to address me and rolled her eyes after fixing the iPad. In fact, she did not say a single word and just went off to talk to a few what looked like to be high school boys. Like I said before, the food is only decent, but waiting 30 minutes to even be acknowledged by a server when there are only about 5 other tables with people around is quite upsetting. She clearly is either inexperienced or just cannot handle her job! I have been to August 8 at the Bramalea location a total of 3 times and this one visit was byfar the WORST I have ever had. Imagine going to a restaurant and having your server not say a single word to you, no \"Hello\", \"Thank you for coming\", \"What would you like to drink?\" NOTHING! All this server did was bring water for me and my boyfriend, leave, come back to fix the iPad, and leave again just to bring out the bill WHILE WE ARE STILL EATING. It is not a
welcoming environment in here, I will be sticking to the Oakville location. This is the worst august 8 experience I have ever had and it has promoted me to leave this review. Please watch who you decide to hire."}
{"text":"Our family loves sushi. This was special late Xmas treat since I lost my wallet on 20th if December. Anyhow we drove 130km and were pleasantly surprise at the little details this place has. Pepper and salt for our fried octopus tentacles. Roasted seaweed for red caviars sushi. Wife tea was never empty. Washroom have private cubicles very clean. Tuna sashimi are fresh. Squid are divine. Chicken skewers slight touch of curry spice are soft. Garlic tumbles cubes of teriyaki steak melt in your mouth. 
My daughter loves her udon, my wife thought sweet and sour soup was touch bit spicy though she have to admit it is her favorite in GTA. I should have order on tap Sapporo but since I was only driver I held back. 
Service was a bit slow since restaurant was at full capacity. We came at 5 pm Friday before the dinner rush and witness the mayhem. My favorite was I think red dragon rolls but we forgot the name when I asked hostess she thought it was white dragon roll and reorder the dish, it came as last plate, so white dragon was bland vs both savoury and sour for red dragon and because of this and parking I reduced the stars by one less from perfection. Masa in Vaughan still rules ayce."}
{"text":"Service is very very slow. We went to August 8 on weekday lunch and although it was relatively quiet, it took forever for them to bring our food.

When we finally got our sushi, the fish were a thinnest sliver, you would need to order  twice as much.

Food wasn't great either. I would probably never go back there again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on SAT with my wife.Food was horrible.Fish was not fresh at all. We gagged due to strong fishy taste.There was also no one at the front to welcome guest. We got there early.Somebody took our name and said to wait 10min. We ended up waiting 25min. They put somebody else who came late (they did not 'check in' because nobody at the front) instead, thinking those people were us. They claimed they called our name yet we never heard it. Definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"Wnet there this past Saturday with the family and was disappointed with the food quality. First, it started when we ask for a table for 6 then the host told us that we should have called for reservation becuz there busy but there was no line up plus there was 2 big tables available. So he sit us down and we noticed that all the workers around are all males,wow! We order and the food came and we ask for more wasabi twice and three times then the waiter brings it. Sushi rice quality was soggy and the fish meat does not taste fresh. Disappointed for our first time."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing special. Service was below average. They seemed under staffed and no one was checking on us or refilling our drinks. Also both the men's and women's washrooms were disgusting! Absolutely unacceptable. Ps for $28.99, unlimited drinks should included."}
{"text":"Yes, I like it.
It is a very clean and welcoming japanese restaurant.
The portions are small, so you can try many different dishes. 
The sushi rolls are cut in 6 pieces, turning it in big chunks. I don't like to eat with the mouth too full. If they cut if thinner slices, it would be better."}
{"text":"First time to this chain restaurant.  When we arrived at 6pm on Saturday, there wasn't too many people in the whole restaurant.  Later the inner section was all full. The décor is modern.  Our male server was very nice and always smile.  He some time will ask and make suggestion on our AYCE choices.  

The Sashimi was fresh.  The Sushi and Maki were well prepared.  The Maki and Sushi could stay together even if lifted high unlike some restaurants would fall apart.  

The price was $24.99 pp, not very cheap but was good when you compared the food quality.

A surprise to me was Dim Sum on the menu which my Mom was delighted"}
{"text":"This place can get busy on Friday evenings, so make a reservation if you can! 

We love going to August 8. I particularly love their salmon sashimi and their rain drop rolls. It doesn't have as big of a menu as other locations, but there are still a lot of options. They also offer dim sum and bubble tea, which I can't say I've seen anywhere else.

On weekends, the quality of food is GREAT. Definitely 5/5. I've been a few times during the weekdays for dinner and the quality wasn't as good. That being said, their quality any day is better than 168, and I'm saying this as someone who used to have 168 every two weeks and thought they were amazing. 

Service is always great. Definitely order the sponge cake."}
{"text":"I go back and forth between 3 and 4 on August 8. They were so good when they opened, then there was a questionable period and now the food and service is good again. The blowtorch items on their menu are amazing and the new sunshine roll is great too. We had a party of 12 with latecomers and little kids but our waitress Maddie pulled it off with flawless execution. The iPad navigation is a lot easier to use than in other ayce places."}
{"text":"Always great food with a nice selection in a modern clean atmosphere. The service is hit or miss with mostly hit!  They do need to work on the alcoholic drinks. I don't know if it's the menu or the bartender."}
{"text":"I came here for the all you can eat lunch with my girlfriend. We used a Groupon as well as a coupon my girlfriend found to get an extremely good price. The food came promptly and at the perfect temperature. We had many dishes including the spicy Salmon sushi rolls, spicy beef udon noodles, differing kinds of tempura etc. All the food that we tried was excellent. The only time we had a problem was due to a sushi mix up. However that issue was resolved quickly and we got the correct dish. 

5/5 would come back again. The only thing of importance to note is that if you do not use a Groupon expect to spend 40-50 bucks for the all you can eat for two people. Through our groupon and coupon savings we spent around $25."}
{"text":"All the reviews about management are correct. This is literally the worst customer service experience i've ever had. I've never left a review for a restaurant but this manger literally ruined our night of rude he was. First, the manger comes out storming from the kitchen after we placed an order and while we're talking he starts asking us \"how much you want of this and that\" and starts by crossing out things in our order. Then when i asked what the problem was, he says \"that's too much sushi, i can't take out that much food in one order\" i was like are you kidding me? isn't this AYCE ? what kind of non sense is this. I told him to please get the order the same exact way we ordered (we had no left overs and we were prepared to pay for any extras). He then gives us a rude face and walks off, when he comes back to drop a plate i asked him what's your name? and he stutters and says \"John\" and I'm like ok sure .. someone comes after him and i ask what's the name of this manger and they say \"Ivan\" and i'm like are you kidding me again? WHAT is happening. Fast forward he sends one of the staff to apologize after we complained about the poor service, and doesn't have the guts to come out and talk to us, hiding inside till we leave. When we insisted on getting the apology from him, he comes out, still doesn't apologize, talk more non sense about what why would you ask me my name and so on till it was so irritated we had to leave. Never returning to this restaurant, been going to august 8 in Hamilton for 5 years. This was just an awful awful experience. This isn't away to treat your guests specially with the prices you're charging."}
{"text":"I went about two months ago for AYCE dinner. The fish was very fresh and there was a lot of variety on the menu. Thanks, August 8 staff"}
{"text":"Creepy management rules


People can opt for the Lunch or Dinner (more complete and expensive) menu. The problem is, if anyone at the table opts for the Dinner menu, then everybody else needs to pay for the Dinner menu as well. If you don't accept that (paying extra for something that you don't need), the management gives you the option to move to another table. So, the friends that pay for Dinner menu stay at one table, while the others stay at the Lunch menu table.

In other words, the management is afraid of customers stealing food from friends and because of that is enforcing crazy rules on its customers."}
{"text":"I had visited the Oakville branch before and I can say that they are far better than the Brampton branch. When I entered the restaurant there was a man standing near the bar, I guess he was the manger but it felt to me he was more like a Military guy is telling me what I should be doing there.

He showed us our table and asked if its our first time or not. At the end he tells me that please try not to order everything at once, try to order one at a time. I guess he should leave that to the customer what they want to order and how much they want to.

It was a bad start at this branch but I guess the servers were far better than the manager. They always had a smile, asked if we were okay with the food and if I need anything else.

The food was not bad they have some good sushis and dim sums. In my opinions this is the first sushi place that also makes good Dim Sums. My favourite is the Beef Dim Sum. If you are someone who wants more variety for sushi then this place is not for you.

Don't forget to order the Sponge Cake with Mango Ice Cream, dessert was the best thing at this place.

Food: 4.0
Service: 2.0
Decor: 3.5"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at the Bramalea City Centre location which made it my first and last visit at the location. Infact, the Oakville location was the exact opposite and had a great experience. I went at around 5pm which was perfect time because I didn't have to wait for a table and the service was fast. 

We were taken care by Emma, she was our server and thumbs up to her. We had ordered many different sushi, sashimi and grilled items. My favourite was the torched salmon with crispy tempura, crab, cucumber and avocado in it. I ended up ordering 2 of each!! 

The best part about this sushi place is the dessert. they have pretty good dessert choices specially the sponge cake and mango ice cream. Ice creams here remind me of home-made taste, which are rich in milk and flavour.

This place is one of the best sushi places in Oakville.

Would definitely come back. Thanks Emma!!"}
{"text":"We tried August 8 on Spadina for dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and offered tea and water as soon as we arrived. There is a nice mix of dim sum and sushi on the menu. You order through a tablet on your table, which is ultra convenient. You can also request the bill through the tablet. 

The rolls were made fresh and tasted good. They seemed to be a little heavy on the rice. The dim sum dishes came out hot but you could tell they were once frozen and reheated. The quality of food is decent but for over $30 per person, I expected a little bit more."}
{"text":"The wait to get seated was long (over 45 minutes), while the other side of the restaurant remained completely empty. It is evident that they don't care about customer service and wait times. 

The food was equivalent to other ayce sushi restaurants I have been too. They should get rid of the dim sum dishes all together, they're overcooked and lacking quality. 

The waiters did not seem to care about the order of the dishes they brought. While ordering our mains, we also placed an order for dessert (using the IPad system). Shockingly enough, the custard cake was one of the first dishes brought to the table. 

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The sushi was not good at all,  the rice was overcooked which was disappointing. The maki rolls also had too much sauce on them. I expected it to be better but I did not enjoy anything that I ordered and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch buffet and it was so good! It's very busy so make sure you reserve seats or are willing to wait (especially if you're coming with a larger party). They have everything from dimsum to sushi which was my favourite part because sometimes eating the same thing for a long time can get tiring. You order on an iPad and the food that comes is always really fresh (although some dishes take a while). I feel like they are a reasonably priced restaurant and I can't wait to come here again after I return to Toronto. My boyfriend always craves this too!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a weekday and the place was really empty. I was a bit worried that the food would not be good, but it was better than expected. Everything came out quickly and my group did not have to wait long between orders for our food to come out, like what many ayce sushi places do.

Presentation of the food was nice and the servers were all very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of AYCE despite of really liking sushi because they tend to be terrible (*cough* heart sushi @ fairview mall). This is one place where I feel like the food is decent and worth the price and I'm not traumatized after eating there.

It's a typical ~$30 dinner but for that price there's a decent variety of items including sashimi and none of the items were bad. Highlights: octopus sashimi, blow torched sashimi, beef sashimi, cooked beef was chewable, all day dim sum. Oh, they also bring a huge plate of sashimi if you order it, unlike a lot of other places that will bring you 5 pieces when you ordered 20. Tablet ordering system.

I also tried this place in Hamilton/Burlingon area and it was about the same quality there too. Good if you feel like pigging out on sushi and don't care about high grade fish. It won't taste as good as high end places, but it's a good value and worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I found out about this place via Facebook and let me tell you, I am so glad that I did! 

First of all, this one is located right by Dundas and Spadina! Which is (in my books) pretty darn close to my school so now I don't have to go all the way down to Yonge and York Mills for my AYCE sushi break. As soon as you turn onto Spadina coming from Dundas, it's right there! So location is amazing.

Onto the decor/ambiance. I loved it! Very minimal but elegant. There are a lot of booths and a good amount of tables so you're sure to get comfy seating if you come in at the right times. It's not that quiet but it's also not that loud so it's very peaceful/relaxing :) 

Onto the best part: the food! Now yes, I agree with other reviews saying the food was mediocre but it's AYCE... what can you really expect? The portions are definitely well thought out as they aren't that big and you can finish it easily. For the dimsum portion, we only got the steamed pork shui mai, deep fried shrimp roll, ha gow, and steamed beef balls. Everything was great but the steamed beef balls. I personally didn't try it but my boyfriend didn't like it so I'm just going based off his opinion! 

For tempura, I got my all time favourite: yam tempura! It's so small and cutely sized. It's not as crunchy as I'd like for it to be but it was still pretty darn bomb!

Sushi: everything we ordered was really good. Spicy salmon sushi, eel/unagi sushi, butterfish sushi, red dragon maki roll, salmon/avocado maki roll, eel maki roll, spicy salmon hand roll, avocado/salmon hand roll... I loved each and every one of it! I also randomly ordered a corn and mayo sushi - just one piece to try it out - and surprisingly, it didn't taste THAT bad although I wish it was cheese instead of mayo! 

Everything came out at a pretty decent rate. You order everything through an iPad BUT this one is special. At a sushi joint that uses an iPad system, you'd press the order button and wait for a server to come and press in a password that'll send the order off but here, as soon as you place your order, it just goes to the chefs and then comes out to you in minutes! I don't know how it works so well but I truly love this. 

Pricing wise, we went during lunch time on a Monday and it's $18.99/person, with 12% tip totalled to about $24 which (in my books again) is not that bad! For me to find a really good AYCE sushi place is so hard so I'm incredibly grateful August 8 opened one downtown and now I have a favourite AYCE sushi within walking distance of my school! Will definitely be back for dinner someday..."}
{"text":"Ambience and decor is nice. They use an iPad ordering system here which is usually convenient, but we experienced technical difficulties on our visit. Hopefully they worked out the kinks. 

The food here is generally good. Some items are sub par and others are really good. Specifically, the hot dishes are yummy. All things deep fried was great. The sushi is NOT good. The rice was mushy and overly vinegary - particularly a poor experience on my visit I think. I've been to other August 8 locations and the sushi was not as bad. 

My general advice is to come here if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of quality for a HUGE variety of dishes, and don't come if you're craving sushi - you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday and used a Groupon. We were a group of 11. I'm pleasantly surprised with the nice decor of the restaurant. Overall, not the best all you can eat place. Giving them 1 stars due to the HORRIBLE service. It was shitty service because they knew they didn't need to work for their tip as their 15% tip was already included in our bill. Rude remarks from servers, never bother to come and clean up our table once we stopped ordering. JUST HORRIBLE AND DISORGANIZED. we pressed for the \"call for waiter\" button on their iPad about 20 times and no one came. Looked around for someone and they were just gathered around talking to each other. 

Wouldn't recommend. You can go elsewhere for better food and service aka Heart Sushi."}
{"text":"Great location but service sucks, quality was ok and now has gotten worse, especially on meat."}
{"text":"This ayce sushi joint is VERY VERY GOOD. There are a lot of items on the menu to choose from. They have torched sushi...which is BONUS...cuz not all ayce sushi places have them. And to top it off, their dim sum is actually pretty good. Overall, you cant go wrong when you come here. Their service is also excellent...food came quick. I wish they'd open one in Mississauga. But I'll settle for Brampton for now!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised to find the place was alive. The dim sum was much smaller then what the pictures show and the tempura comes just as one single piece so order accordingly. The chocolate ice cream was really good and the sushi was as well. The iPad ordering system works great. The food comes fairly quickly and the price was reasonable for AYCE lunch. Overall it was good but the dinner prices are very expensive so I would suggest going for lunch."}
{"text":"Not bad for sushi and dim sum. Portions are small snd most are by piece. Tea are tea bags. ??? bean curd roll is deep fried not steamed (usually authentic ones are so I didnt expect it :p should have read the English side). Spicy scallop isnt spicy and doesnt taste like much. Nice place. Clean. Modern. Seats are leather but back rest is facric ( I know this is random). $5.50 sapporo on tap and sake available. 

LUNCH: Mon-Thu $15.50, friday-sunday $16.50, holiday $17.50. DINNER: Mon-Thu $24.99, Fri-Sat $25.99, Sun $25.99, holiday $26.99.

Three locations: Oakville, Burlington & Hamilton."}
{"text":"Give this place a chance. Honestly I've always been skeptical about AYCE sushi- how can a business sustain itself and provide good sushi when it's all you can eat? Costs must be cut somewhere right? So when I heard about dim sum AND sushi, I was even more skeptical. But then I read the reviews here and figured it was worth a shot - especially since my cravings for AYCE was pretty strong.  Upon walking into the place, I already got good vibes- but of course, a nice place doesn't mean good food. It was only until the sushi was brought to our table that I was sold. The sushi was fresh and very similar to the pictures on the iPad. There was a wide enough selection of nigari, teppanyaki, hand rolls, special rolls, etc. that I think there is something for everyone. In terms of the dim sum, everything was to standard. Nothing amazing but nothing disappointing- except maybe the custard bun. I'm not convinced they make the dim sum in-house because it looked and tasted very frozen fresh, if you know what I mean.

The iPad made things very quick. From placing an order to eating it took no more than 5-10 min. Waiters were also fast to collect plates and even gave a tutorial on how to order from the iPad. Granted, I also visited with my boyfriend on a Monday during lunch so it wasn't busy at all. 

A few logistics- sashimi is only available in the evening. However, they do allow you to have sashimi in your AYCE for lunch- you just have to pay the dinner price. For $18.99, I definitely would come back, but I can't justify paying $29.99 for dinner (even with sashimi). 

Would I come again? Probably. But only under specific circumstances- the $18.99 deal for lunch on Monday-Thursday. So I guess you could say I enjoyed the experience, but didn't love it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Used to. 

This place has gone down hill in terms of quality significantly over the past year. Kind of sad - we preferred August 8 over all options in the whole west gta/Mississauga area. 
 
The food is just 'meh' now. No thrills.

The bad: 
At some point in time, August 8 boasted sashimi that would melt in your mouth. 
This time we had warm sashimi - huge turn off!

They have an app called 'Eatata' that you can order straight off of as an alternative to iPad menus - which is neat, yes. However, their app lists 'Bonito tuna sashimi', which you won't find on the laminated menus they give you, and when we ordered it off the app, we were told they don't actually have any to serve. What? 

The 'meh':
I get that you can't exactly expect 5-star quality when it comes to ordering cooked/grilled food/dim sum at sushi place, I understand. 
But compared to K&B or 168 Japan Buffet, it was terrible. 
The dim sum were puny and frozen. The only good thing about it was that they had a wider variety compared to its competitors. The tripe wasn't half bad though. Pretty close to the ginger tripe you would get at Chinese restaurants. 

As for desserts, there's no red bean, sesame or ginger. Only mango, green tea, chocolate, and vanilla. 

I will say however, their maki rolls are good. Good fish/rice ratio - just the right amount of rice to. Not to mention they have soft shell crab here. 

Overall, I think this marks end of August 8's era for me. The service was ok, but definitely not enough to make for the food. After that warm sashimi, there's really nothing left that gives August 8 an advantage over it's competition."}
{"text":"It looks like the reviews here are a hit or miss here, but I had a pleasant experience. After hearing there was a dim sum/sushi ayce place in the city, I was excited to try this place out!

Came here on a weeknight for a friend's birthday which wasn't empty but not fully busy. They have an iPad ordering system which seems to be a standard nowadays but it makes for easy ordering. The decor is modern and chic. 

I really enjoyed the portion sizes here and the selection of dim sum and sushi. The dim sum obviously isn't as high quality as it would be a regular Chinese restaurant, but I thought it was worth it for what it was. I enjoyed the curried squid, chicken feet, siu mai and shrimp dumpling (the wrapping on the shrimp dumpling was very aesthetic!) 

On to the sushi, the sashimi seemed fresh with a nice thick enough slice to enjoy. Go for all the torched stuff on the menu -- torched shrimp, torched salmon, torched dragon roll... I'm a sucker for aburi sushi and this wasn't bad at all for ayce. There were some items that were a miss like the salmon tataki and beef tataki... I would avoid it as it wasn't done well. It had a weird sauce and the beef seemed too cooked and not sour enough. 

Some of the desserts were also hit or miss, but the custard bun was a nice touch, I enjoyed the tiramisu served in a shot glass, along with a mango ice cream to finish the night. I had the green tea ice cream, and mango pudding as well, but it wasn't memorable enough to be reordered. 

I found that it's difficult to find a good ayce sushi downtown Toronto, and almost no ayce dim sum anywhere. I enjoyed the dim sum items slightly more than the sushi/Japanese, but the sushi was still quite enjoyable. I'd return again :)"}
{"text":"I ordered take out for lunch from August 8. I tried their spicy salmon bowl and it was great. The fish was fresh and so were the ingredients. The bow contained so many options including crab salad, edamame, seaweed salad and cabbage. I'm not sure where corn plays a role in this dish however that wasn't a big deal. I would definitely suggest trying it out"}
{"text":"Excellent service 
Food was very good.  
I went to August 8 for a friends birthday party. It was all you can eat lunch. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu since there were 10 of us. Many things came as one pieces but very good and flavourful. My favourite was the edamame and cheese fried dumpling. 10/10
Dessert was boring
Just ice cream and fried banana
Not my taste"}
{"text":"We went at 9, and last call was at 9:45 as restaurant closes at 10pm.  It took them 10 minutes to seat us when we already made reservation.  Food was ok, but was very disappointed with the beef enoki wrap, as they wrapped asparagus with it when asparagus supposed to be wrapped with bacon, so it seems like they were trying to make 2 different dishes in one.  The beef was so hard; they definitely over cooked it.  At the end of the night, i found a curly hair in my mango ice cream, but i was too tired to hunt down a waiter to report it."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places our family has been to ... and the bonus is they serve dimsum too! That was definitely a selling point for me to trek all the way out to Brampton for a meal ... but conveniently, the place is fairly close to the Pearson airport, so it was the perfect lunch stop during an airport run.

First the dimsum. Let me start by saying, my family is Cantonese Chinese, so our standards for dimsum are very high. We definitely did not expect much from a AYCE setting, but not only was the dimsum authentic, the presentation beautiful, but the taste was absolutely and delightfully delicious! They don't have a huge selection of dimsum choices, offering only a dozen or so classic staples, but the actual quality of it way exceeded our expectations and is more befitting of an upscale dimsum house, we were very impressed and our palates happily satisfied.

Now the sushi. From reading some of the other reviews, it seems like some people might have an issue with the pricing. I have 2 things to say to this -- 1) their pricing is completely reasonable! and 2) you get what you pay for. When eating raw fish, do you really want to risk it with the $11.99 hole-in-the-wall down the street? Freshness and quality of meat matters a great deal. August8's sushi selection was fresh, generously proportioned, beautifully plated and very yummy ... we particularly loved their hand rolls and even the typical side dishes (which could be bland in many places) such as seaweed salad, mango salad, endamame were just as exquisite and yummy. There's even a few Thai appetizers on the menu to induce more variety. All in all, August8 was more delicious than pretty much all the AYCE sushi places we've tried, many of who charge even more than August8. In all honesty, concerning the pricing, I feel that they should charge more (not less) than what they currently do, because the quality of their food is well worth it. I came on a Groupon deal and actually felt bad for saving money on this meal, since the quality of the food was so obviously more than the worth of our Groupon. Our family of 4 left filled to our necks (including my father who is usually not the most avid sushi eater due to the whole raw fish thing), but instead of feeling like we just stuffed our faces with crappy buffet fast food, we felt like we just had a high quality meal. Oishii!!

The decor is tasteful and artfully modern. It's cozy enough for family and friends to have a meal, elegant enough for a business dinner, but also atmospheric enough for a date. The ipad ordering system is awesome & easy to navigate. The servers are super attentive, and the order in which they bring out your food is organized and attentive, so while there is may be a 10-15 minute wait between batches of orders (good time to digest, check your phones, use the loo), they roll it out like a proper meal instead of just haphazardly shoving food in front of you. Again, quality and presentation matters ... their attention to details makes it feel more like a sensible meal instead of what is often buffet-chaos. Friendly managers/owners (?) greeted us when we left, lovely people.

I'm glad we got a chance to discover August8, I hope they'll open one further out East so we don't have to trek as far next time, but there will definitely be a next time for our family!

itadakimasu!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon on a weekday for lunch 

Pros
- iPads to order
- Professional staff 
- Quick service 
- Sushi was great
- Nice ambiance 

Cons
- the non sushi items (chicken /beef) weren't too tasty 
- At $20/person (tax included in that price) for lunch I think is a little much."}
{"text":"Really loved the iPad ordering system. Service was amazingly quick and the food was good. Nice atmosphere, would be going back again."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was not overly busy. Ordering was easy and serving was quick. I have to say the sushi and sashimi both exceeded my expectation. Their sashimi was very fresh and so was the side dishes. Dim sum was mediocre though but if you go there dim sum shouldn't be your main courses. Anyways, I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Unlimited sushi! Yum. Pretty cool and clever concept. You order from an iPad and they bring your food out. Price isn't too bad, everything is very flavorful and I enjoyed my meal. They had pretty good salmon sashimi. The decor and ambiance is very modern and comfortable. I would come again on my next trip"}
{"text":"Great place to get both dim sum and Japanese cuisine. Dim sum didn't look so great but tasted really good! Service is nice and restaurant was clean, modern and quiet."}
{"text":"Kind of hesitated between 2 and 3 stars. The food isn't great, but it isn't bad either. I was also a little disappointed by their lunch menu, it really is very limited compared to the dinner menu. For example, no sashimi at lunch. There are better sushi joints in Oakville that cost roughly the same amount. The restaurant is clean though, and looks (but doesn't taste) more upscale than your typical sushi AYCE."}
{"text":"I have never been to a sushi place that puts this much time and effort into their food, their presentation and their service. Really spot on at August 8. We walked in on a Thursday night for dinner and noticed that the decor and vibe of August 8 was much more sophisticated than we were expecting. The all you can eat sushi places that I was used to were more along the lines of Kyoto and Fushimi with the fanciest being Spring Sushi at Yonge and Dundas. While there's nothing wrong with any of those places, they have a certain vibe to them that you come to associate with all you can eat sushi joints. August 8 however, was not like the others I mentioned. It has dim lighting, music, and cool decor that really put it above the rest.

We were seated and shown how to use the iPad ordering system. Points to note:
- There are pictures for every item on the menu
- There's a summary page where you can review your order before submitting
- There's a breakdown of what's in each sushi roll when you tap on the image

The variety on the menu is also something I really appreciated. Not only was there dim sum, sushi and other Japanese cooked food, there was also a variety of items within each category. 

I did find that the average roll size was larger than what I was comfortable with. The thing is, they weren't stuffed with rice, they were stuffed with actual filling. It was a bit difficult to eat but not a huge deal. 

One more thing that literally blew me away at August 8 was the presentation, the tableware and cutlery they used. Some of the plates were stone?!? The sashimi came on a bed of ice chips, presented beautifully and I also ordered udon that came in a cute stone bowl. Didn't even feel like AYCE!"}
{"text":"(3.5/5)

The biggest draw of August 8 is that it's one of the few AYCE places that provides a good selection of both dim sum and sushi, meaning you can take that picky eater in your life and chances are they'll find something they like.

The food ranges from \"meh\" to good. Nothing really \"wowed\" me, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because decent food is still worth eating. The sushi isn't as fancy as other places (nothing torched, no gold flakes, etc), but it came out quickly and was tasty. If there's one thing they can improve on, it's that some dishes came out on the cold side, such as the dim sum. Also, the drinks are cheap - $5.99 for a Long Island Iced Tea? Say no more.

The lunchtime menu has a large selection, ranging from dim sum and sushi, to teppanyaki and udon. The only section that I felt was weak was the dessert - nothing really stood out. They also don't serve sashimi during lunch, but the price is cheaper as well.

In terms of service, I was really impressed. Compared to other similar places I've been to, August 8 is THE only restaurant that actually brought out every single item we ordered in a timely manner (compared to Heart Sushi that forgot about 10% of our orders, and downtown Kaka that forgot a ridiculous 40% of our orders). The servers were all on point and for a small restaurant, there must have been 6-8 servers on deck all making sure EVERY table was looked after.

For $20.99, I think it's a great way to spend your lunch. You won't leave hungry for sure!"}
{"text":"For an all you can eat location, I was very impressed with the interior decor and utensils, etc. This location is relatively new, clean and service is very rapid and efficient. Food comes out quickly and also taste quite fresh.. better than most AYCE sushi places. They have a wide variety in food options. 
Only downfall for this torontonian is that this location is quite far. But definitely one of the best AYCE sushi. Better than their other locations in Toronto. I definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here and the service is very prompt and fast. I will highly recommend this new all you can restaurant in the heart of Chinatown Toronto. How can you go wrong with ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI & DIM SUM? The food is also very fresh here as well!"}
{"text":"This place has AYCE sushi and dim sum. The staff were fast and attentive and very nice. The dishes came out fast and there were some newer dishes that I haven't seen at other AYCE places. It's a little pricey, but I would still come back again. Overall, it's a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I kinda like the fact that this opened at the mall. Brampton doesn't have much of a selection on good AYCE sushi, so I'm pretty happy with this one. Of course, as with all AYCE, the quality of the food is never excellent. It is just enough to satisfy my cravings though!

Also, as a bonus, they have a selection of dimsum, so might as well get your dim sum fix here! I do think that it's quite dry and sub par but hey, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"August 8 is one of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants. I went here on Boxing Day with family and friends. It was a last minute desicion, so we called to see if they had any reservations left which they didn't. The hostess said that if we came right away we wouldn't have to wait. Sure enough, no wait time at 6pm. As the evening went on it was full. Thank you hostess!

The iPad was ready to go when we sat down at the table and our drink orders were taken promptly. What I really love is that despite our large order, not everything came out at once. We received out tampura, then a edemame a little while later. Sashimi after, then sushi and eventually our hot entrees. It was nice to have it spread out and try little bits of everything. 

The rolls are pretty basic, nothing new or crazy. The spicy salmon is good - always my go-to. Wish they had more fish options that didn't contain shrimp or eel as I am allergic. The rolls are fresh and tasty though. 

Sashimi is fresh and delicious. We even placed a second order of the salmon. Teppanyaki was delicious as well. The marinade on the meat was great and it wasn't so overcooked that it was tough.

The staff came around often to take away the empty plates. The only problem we had was getting our drinks refilled. The server took our order and then didn't return for 10min. 

Dessert was good. The usual suspects - deep fried banana, custard roll, ice cream, etc. Our bill came quickly. The price is comparable to all other AYCE sushi restaurants in Oakville and Burlington. 

We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I saw the video from blogto and since sushi and dim sum are two of my favourite restaurant foods I was dying to try this place out. The outside decor is very simple compared to the inside. Inside he restaurant was very nicely decorated and made you forget you were in busy china town. The staff are friendly and still seemed very new to their job which wasn't a big deal for me. 

FOOD: This restaurant as a dim sum/sushi place was good/surprising for dim sum. But compared to a real dim sum restaurant I'd say you can get better. As a sushi restaurant I was a little disappointed. The rolls were basic, the fish weren't fresh and the sushi rice wasn't fresh either. As an all you can eat sushi restaurant I would go elsewhere. If I enjoyed anything for the name it would be their salads or cubed steak....lol

All in all I would rate this place a 6/10 on food alone. The idea was great but when put together it is clear it's half good but worth your money to go to a restaurant that serves separately."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for a small mixed group- meaning mix of picky and adventurous eaters. Everyone will find something they like on the menu. 

The variety is great. It's a great mix of dim sum and sushi with most of the favourites on the menu. Service is pretty fast. The grilled ribs, chicken wings and shrimp rolls were a hit."}
{"text":"The selection seems to be pretty limited in terms of AYCE. The ipad I had was having glitches where it would freeze, needed the server to put through or duplicated orders would come through. Although limited the food was good and came our pretty fast most of the time surprisingly because I came on a holiday during lunch but it could be because this is a smaller city? I like their child pricing where its $1.20/yr of age up until 12yrs old because its more realistic. It sucks when your charged at almost adult pricing for your kids and they have a small appetite.  Overall decent place to go to for a decent price! Their cheese wontons are delicious and addictive! Their mango pudding is was decently sized (like a double shot glass) and tasted pretty good"}
{"text":"I could just as easily award this place 3 stars, as there was quite a number of items on the menu which weren't all that great - even with tempered expectations for AYCE. On the flip side, there were also many items which I really enjoyed too. Armed with the knowledge of my last experience, I could return here and still have countless items to order which I know that I'll really enjoy - so I'll let that be the tie-breaker in the rating.

I know it would probably be helpful to the review to break down what I ordered. But if you knew the obscene quantify of food my group ordered, you'd understand that it would require Stephen Hawking level IQ to remember it all and then evaluate it several weeks later.

In a general sense, the fish quality is pretty good for AYCE, but could be improve with slightly less rice for the nigiri in particular. The torched sushi was the highlight for me.The cooked meat options rarely rose above average - though chicken wings always have a way of being better than the rest.

It's quite nice inside and the service was terrific. I really enjoyed my evening and most of the food was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Beef teriyaki is very fresh taste and spicy scallop roll is the best. I wish they have a beef short rib (Kalbi ) on lunch menu . Everything else is good! Please consider putting kalbi on the lunch menu. I love august 8 but, This is the only reason makes me go to another ayce restaurant .
 short ribs lol"}
{"text":"I wanted this to be good but I bit into a bloody chicken wing. Waiters are disorganized, orders never arrived, things came to our table we never ordered - overall just confusion (wait staff are very friendly though!). Quality is mediocre and at $20.99 for lunch it isn't cheap."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a family dinner here on rave reviews from family members and it was quite a pleasant dining experience.  iPad ordering seems to be the standard for dim sum/sushi AYCE restaurants now so it's nice to pace our meal and order as desired.  Portions are quite small for some orders so be sure to start off modest and reorder as needed.  I think favs at our table were the Korean kalbi ribs and sautéed beef cubes.  Service is probably the fastest we've ever enjoyed at a similar AYCE restaurant; entrees were constantly being brought out empty plates were always being cleared.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Price per person is a bit on the higher end but reasonable given the menu variety and location.  We would patronize again!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
It's AYCE, so you won't leave hungry. The beef and mushroom rolls were a highlight.
On an individual basis the staff were pleasant enough and attentive. The poor service seemed to revolve around lack of communication, not lack of concern.

Cons: 
Bland, unexceptional food; even the wasabi and ginger didn't have a kick. Fortunately they had additional chili sauce, which helped.
It was early at lunch on a Tuesday, but they'd already \"run out of\" several items.
The place was deserted and we ordered quickly and then waited more than half an hour for the first dishes. They said the host had given the kitchen the wrong table number, for what that's worth. When the food arrived, our first and second orders all came at once...there wasn't enough room on the tiny table for all of the plates, so obviously much of the food was cold by the time we got to it. The chicken wings we ordered first came after more than an hour, at the end of the meal.
The website is deliberately misleading. Under \"lunch menu\" they show the dinner menu, but when you look at the iPad several items are not available at lunch, and they offer no sashimi, whatsoever. They need to fix the website, for the sake of clarity, and honesty.
We had a coupon, but they charged HST on the regular menu price. This is like buying something on sale, but paying the full tax on the sale price. That's illegal. Not worth a debate over lunch for two, but if you go for dinner with a large party and have a coupon, it will add up, so be advised.
Many of the reviews I read suggested this was one of the better AYCE buffets, but that wasn't our experience, at all."}
{"text":"Good service, their tepenyaki is very good. And if you order from there first, the food comes quickly. The sushi hand rolls were great because they put a ton of salmon all the way to the bottom of the roll. The butterfish roll wasn't as fresh so we had to bring it back. It's good, but for the price, it wasn't worth it. Drinks are not included in the overall price so it's an extra charge."}
{"text":"Came to this location on mothers day and I must say that everything was on point! We had the dinner menu for $28.99 but you can BE SURE that I got my moneys worth!  My waistline definitely grew 5 inches after I left!  I ordered an entire pig of Siu Mai and a farmload of Har Gow!

I tried to kill all of their salmon and tuna sashimi and it was all cut with precision and the presentation was on point as well!  The medium rare steak cut was tremendous along with their tempura, salads, ice creams, rice, squid, and probably some other stuff I am forgetting but it was all sooo damn good!

I will be coming back here next time I am craving Sushi AND Dim Sum at the SAME TIME!  WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Decent all you eat place. Food was what I expected for AYCE - don't expect anything too spectacular. Place was nice and clean and modern inside."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the Bramalea City Centre.  Well technically it's part of the mall but the entrance is from the exterior facing Queen street (north west side) between the Pickel Barrel and Sears close to Forever 21.  One of the exterior walls didn't even look like it was finished yet.  I don't know how new this place actually is.  I was meeting some friends for a Friday night dinner and we were coming from all over so we made it a bit of a later start instead of our usual time.

This was my first time to any of the August 8 restaurants and while I've been to my fair share of AYCE sushi places this place seems to be comparable in quality and service to say K&B in Etobicoke.  The decor looks classier and although the interior tones are darker such as browns and blacks the place is well lit and neatly furnished.  There are some walls that seem bare though, some that have shelves with nothing on it but besides that really it's just a bonus to have a nicer looking place than some of the other AYCE places I've been to which seem cramped and noisy.  If anything our group was the noise makers - you know who you are...

The portions are generous although I found the nigiri to have a lot of rice and they weren't flattened as much as I'm used to and seemed to be more \"ball\" shaped.  As expected the ordering is done through an iPad and anybody that's been to AYCE knows the deal, point and tap and tap and tap.  Greediness can get the better of you at a place like this if you're a starved group of food loving consumers like this group was and I almost hate to admit it but I think we lost this battle as far as AYCE goes.  I am ashamed that although I put up a good fight, I can admit defeat when it's the truth.  It's safe to say we all came in with good intentions and those intentions were to take no prisoners, order a lot and kill it.  We ordered so much the servers had to start pulling tables together to our two tables because we had nowhere else to put everything that was coming out.  At one point our kind server asked us if they could suspend everything else that was in queue.  We agreed.  That's a loss in my books.

Despite the fact that our greedy eyes are bigger than our stomachs we did well for the most part.  Seaweed salad, a variety of hot food such as wings, katsu, kalbi, dim sum and other small dishes started us off and we were all gung ho but then the rolls and nigiri came and came and came over and over and over and we were like Sun Tzu had our number before we even began.  

We had caused our own defeat
Pwned by sushi at August 8   
More than we could consume

Between the maguro nigiri (OMG they had this at an AYCE place?), unagi, salmon, torched stuff, we didn't even get to our sashimi because that was part of what we had conceded to which when we were begging for mercy.  

OK so we behaved badly but we weren't punished by August 8.  If anything our punishment was self inflicted and August 8 was gracious in their dominance of our team.  Pwned as we had been, we were still able to walk away.

What I learned from this experience is that even the best can go down - hard and without remorse but at the end of the day all is forgiven and hot damn if they didn't have some of the best looking and tasting tataki I've ever had.  

Good stuff here and I'd definitely go back to any of their locations.  I learned from this AYCE experience.  I was humbled and was not left wanting... any more food that is."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of all you can eat sushi places but this one wasn't too bad. The service was very quick and the decor was really nice. The rolls were tasty. Not a lot of vegetarian options though."}
{"text":"This is one of my newest finds! I came across this place with my friends on blogTO and this restaurant combines three of our most favourites things -- dim sum, sushi & an AYCE all day menu! My friends and I came here on a Tuesday afternoon (around 1pm) so it was not too busy, though we were informed they do get incredibly busy on weekends for dinner.

We started off by ordering dimsum -- the portions were nice and small, and our food came relatively quickly. Some dishes tasted like how you would get them at traditional Chinese yumcha.

Japanese food - Their miso soup is not as great as the miso soup you would find at other Japanese restaurants, but their tempura was so nice and crispy. They even had mushroom tempura here, which is a new find for me.Their sushi is pretty good considering the restaurant's concept focuses on two different cuisines. I really liked the dynamite roll as well as the spicy crispy roll and spicy salmon roll. I would also definitely recommend getting the pan fried vegetables, chicken teriyaki & chicken skewers. Only thing that was super disappointing was their red tuna. The texture was like over chewed gum and it lost its taste after a few bites. As well, I did think that their seaweed is a little bit difficult to bite into, so be aware of that when ordering their hand-rolls. 

Dessert - The mango pudding here is so good because they include little chunks of mango!However, I was really disappointed to find out their custard buns were not yolky, but more pastey.

Overall the staff were very nice and lots of them came over to take away our finished dishes as well as fill up our cups with water. Their price was not bad either! I paid $23.50 including tax and tips for an AYCE lunch meal. In Scarborough, prices are a lot more expensive. I really enjoyed August8 and you can definitely catch me back here again!"}
{"text":"Quality AYCE sushi and dim sum, with an iPad ordering system and fast and attentive service. I visited this location on a late Sunday afternoon, and was seated right away. Luckily the lunch AYCE menu ran until about 3:30pm.

4/5 - Venue
5/5 - Food
4/5 - Overall

Venue: The location is clean and well kept, with obvious signs of renovation, just don't expect a modern or high end experience. The seating is spacious, with booth seats and tables alike. There is also a small bar available, with a selection of Canadian classics, and imports like various sakes or Chinese beers. The only downside is that the tile floors really pool up the winter snow and slush, and can lead to a pretty dirty floor.

Food: The sushi here will NOT disappoint. The fish is fresh, and an obvious step up from your typical AYCE sushi joint. The salmon is buttery and tender, and the butterfish is very smooth as well. None of the tough fish that you can sometimes get at AYCE sushi. The dim sum is not bad as well, though I do suspect that not everything is fresh or made in-house. The tempura is light and crisp, and the sushi rolls are well made, and presentation is not poor. Come for the fish, it's worth it.

Overall: One unique aspect is that the ordering system is through an iPad, so there's no need to flag down a waiter, or to repeat a long list of items to them. All our food that was ordered arrived in a timely fashion, though I expect times to be slower during peak hours. The waiter was very accommodating for our vegan friend, and the kitchen happily accepted sushi that incorrectly had mayo in it, and remade it to order. Great service for an AYCE restaurant, and great value at about $22 for lunch."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 10 including 2 toddlers on a Wed evening. Place was booked with ppl waiting for tables. Service was attentive, effecient and very friendly. Food was good especially the fried selections along with the desserts. The sushi portion was lacking however. Modern decor and lively atmosphere added to the enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Mother's Day and it wasn't as busy as expected. Maybe it's due to the location, parking isn't the best as it's in a mall so most of the spots occupied in front of the restaurant are for shoppers.

As not being a huge fan of AYCE meals, the food was pretty decent. The dim sum portions were nice and small so you are able to order sushi and not feel super full. All the dim sum dishes were pretty good but my fave was the chicken feet and the tripe. We ordered an abundant of dim sum dishes but managed to finish most if it since the portions were the right amount. 

In terms of the sushi menu, I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the fish because usually it's not super fresh since restaurants are preparing large amounts all at once at an all you can eat restaurant. My fave sashimi was the butter fish, it literally melted in my mouth! 

Overall, I would definitely come back to this location as there is lots of seating and the service is pretty decent!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a groupon for this place and decided to go on a Friday night. When we got there, the hostess took down our name on a waiting list. We were given 15-20 min wait time which ended up being an hour and a bit. At first glance, the management staff seemed really disorganized. However, after finally getting a table, it was evident. We had to ask for water 3 times before it was brought over to us. I had ordered maki rolls and wanted some wasabi to go with it. I asked one of the staff 4 times before it was finally brought to us. Lastly, my friend had found a piece of plastic on his sushi. When we showed it to the manager, he said oh sorry I will just get you a new one. This was a complete turn off although we were very polite about the whole situation. Overall, the food is average but the service is horrible for the price you pay. Thank god we had used only a groupon and didn't pay $28.99 per person."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the nicer AYCE sushi places I've been too.  We didn't have a single bad dish and the staff was very friendly.  The place was pretty clean and looked great.  However, the crazy upbeat music didn't quite fit the rest of the ambiance and was a tad loud (but that's getting really picky).  

Even though it's on the more expensive end of AYCE sushi I would go again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting concept whereby it is all you can eat dim sum and sushi/sashimi.

The variety of dim sum was large, they serve my favourite curry cuttlefish along with har gwa (shrimp dumpling) and shrimp dumpling with chives. 

They served aburi sushi and sashimi. Sashimi I have had better ones at other all you can eat place. The concept of the all you can eat dim sum is worth a try. They have a Groupon deal now."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!

We went to August 8 because we saw them on blogto and it looked delicious.

Upon getting there, we were immediately seated and started ordering on the iPad. I usually focus my reviews on the actual food - however I have never received such bad service at a restaurant.

We were getting full and had requested that the balance of our order be cancelled. However over 10 min later they still brought us more sushi. From that point on servers kept giving us strange looks and being rude in their demenour when passing our table. 

We asked for our bill and they charged us a $15 over ordering fee although we had requested the order be cancelled.  We asked to speak to the manager - he removed the charge and then literally THREW our new bill on the table. 

The service was terrible and the food was nothing to write home about. We will not be coming back . I would've rated this 0 if I could"}
{"text":"New sushi spot, found a groupon to check it out for the first time! Good news, it's all booths! Who doesn't want a booth when going for sushi with friends. Just as a heads up drinks are not included; pop is $2.50 and tea which is normally free is .99. Not a big deal but i bet some people will get annoyed with the \"added charge \".

The food is exceptional here, this is not your typical fast foodish type of sushi place. It is well garnished and plated.

The sashimi piece are generously cut, I did find two bones in the salmon which freaked me out because I have never experienced a bone in my sushi which made me paranoid for the reminder of the meal that I would find more bones.

They have dimsum appetizers, sushi, sashimi, handrolls, Teriyaki, udon, rice, tempura, better selection than most sushi restaurants and dessert of course!

I really thought the quality is much better than some of my regular sushi spots. I'd rank this as the best in Brampton. Why no 5*?  The charge for drinks and tea and the waitress coming over three times to ask if we were good and wanted our bill, otherwise a decent experience and a must try."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night and was left unimpressed. Soups were in a soup warmer (not in the kitchen) and was lukewarm. Salmon sashimi was the biggest disappointment as some tasted fishy and we had at least 4 slices that had a black mark/bruise on them. We let the server know and he said he'd talk to the chef, but never came back. They messed up one of my orders (ordered 2 squid nigri and 1 shrimp nigri, but got 2 shrimp and 1 squid) but it wasn't that big of a deal. The non-sushi items were pretty good and food came out real quick. Wouldn't come back nor recommend, especially at the price of $30 for dinner."}
{"text":"The. Absolute. Best. All You Can Eat. Ever!

The food was really good. So let's start from the beginning.

We came in on a Sunday during lunch. We were seated fairly quickly, but it soon got busy.

Using the tablets to order, we ordered quite a lot. The food was great, and was served to us fairly quickly.

Some key items to eat:

Shrimp Tempura
Salmon Teriyaki
Beef Teriyaki
Miso Soup
Deep Fried Shrimp Roll

After we were finished, we ordered some ice cream, and let tell you, it was so good!

I ordered the Vanilla Ice cream, it was great, while my family ordered the Mango Ice cream, and apparently, it was good."}
{"text":"Decent enough sushi. The ayce menu includes dim sum! Not great dim sum but passable. The beef tenderloin dish is really good. Service was attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place has gone downhill over the past six to eight months.  They changed the menu's and while I still recommended the dim sum, I feel like their sushi quality has gone down a lot and they've added more rice.  I still go here if I want a combination of sushi and decent dim sum, but it's become your standard AYCE quality as opposed to the premium they had before."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night and enjoyed almost all the food selections I tried. Ordered a coke, which includes free refills.

For dim sum, had the chive dumplings, siu mai and tripe. Loved the tripe, very tasty.  Great bite sized siu mai and light chive dumplings. 

As it was Saturday dinner service, they had feature items on the menu.  Beef tataki was buttery soft.  They also had torched butterfish sushi, torched salmon sushi and torched shrimp and cheese sushi. These were the highlight of my dinner!!! They had a savoury burnt taste, topped with a garlic sauce and some other sauce that looked like soy sauce.  No need to dip it into your soy sauce.

With respect to the maki rolls, the rolls were a large bite sized and we're not stuffed with rice which is great!  The selection however, is limited. They do not have the sushi roll wrapped in rice paper for example.  I didn't see any special concoction found just at August 8 sushi.

Sashimi came in a bowl and on a bed of crushed ice. First salmon sashimi was very thinly cut. The tuna was cut thicker. The tuna was semi frozen which surprised me.  The second set of salmon were cut thicker. Not sure what their standard width is for sashimi, it could be very thin or about a pencil and a 1/4 wide.

The cooked items were of great quality. The ribs were not fatty in comparison to other ayce sushi I've tried.  The wings are crisp, breaded and bite sized. The vegetable tempura was very crisp and I enjoyed the shrimp tempura, which is one of my faves.

As for the salad, the house salad had good toppings with thousand island dressing. It looked fresh and thus, deserve a thumbs up.

Dessert includes tiramisu, green tea, mango, vanilla, chocolate ice cream, fried banana, sesame balls... I don't think that's the complete list, but do know there's enough to choose from!

Service was quick and efficient, only one thing was missed, chicken skewer. The staff don't smile at all, even when you thank them.  However, they are efficient.  The tablet ordering system may freeze on you, in which case, you should tap a picture to unfreeze the tablet.  When you press order history, you can check what others have ordered before you, so you could compare your eating prowess against those who came before you (if you wish, came upon this by accident).  You can call your server via the tablet.

Dining area is clean with comfy booths throughout the whole dining area.  I saw one table with chairs walking out, but mostly booths. They have one person washrooms, marked by gender.

I would definitely come back again and try all the other items I missed, such as fried rice, udon noodles, maki and hand rolls."}
{"text":"Very good/friendly service even though they seemed a bit under staff (very quick and efficient). Dim sum items were limited but just as good as the sushi items. My fav was the torched sushi."}
{"text":"I went to August 8 a lot in Hamilton and was excited when one opened up closer (not really that close) to me!

The entrance is a little confusing because I entered on the left side of the patio then had to walk around and I felt like an idiot. I then saw the sign that they don't take debit or Amex but thankfully they had a ATM right in the lobby so I just took cash out right away. There was only a $0.75 service charge. 

I was seated right away, I like how the tables for 2 are usually booths so you get a lot of privacy compared to Heart Sushi where everything is so open. 

August 8 runs on an iPad ordering system which I love because it's so much faster since it's sent right to the kitchen! The menu was big but there's simple things they were missing such as Avocado Salad. 

I liked how they had a big AYCE Dim Sum menu since most places only has 3 options! I think I ate more Dim Sum than I did sushi. 

Overall, I liked the experience and would return back to August 8 despite the drive. Weekend dinner price is $30.99"}
{"text":"I love the food selection and easy to order on the ipad menu. Its the best in the area for sushi and dim sum together at the same place. Pretty clean place and not bad for the price compared to other places."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant!!!!! I loved the all you can buffet style that was offered. You continue to order from the menu, and fresh items are continued to be delivered, without having to leave your table! The food was amazing! fresh, tasty, and satisfying! There were so many options to choose from. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, and warm. This was my first time going to August 8, but it will not be my last! I am craving their food now from just writing about it. Thanks for the wonderful meal :)"}
{"text":"I heard about this place before and recently saw an ad for it. Decided to come for lunch today. The location is in Chinatown and a bit out of the way. After coming in from the snow it was a nice cozy feeling. The decor is modern asian. It was not busy for the lunch hour on a weekday. It's an all you can eat lunch menu with dim sum favorites and sushi that you order on an iPad system so it's fast. The food came pretty quickly. Service was good but it was not busy. Presentation is excellent for an AYCE place. I liked the bowls they used. The dim sum tastes very fresh and likely made in house on the premises. The hargow and shrimp chive dumpling was petit and delicious. I didn't try everything from the dim sum menu but it's not as extensive as a regular dim sum restaurant. The custard bun was very fresh and the bun was soft and chewy. Sushi nigiri was not bad, the salmon was a nice portion to the rice. The rolls seemed to have a lot of filler but maybe that is typical for AYCE. Dragon roll was acceptable. My friend ordered the dynamite roll without tobiko and they were able to accommodate. They have a good dessert selection. The only thing that stood out was the chicken wings which looked like they were refried and it was undercooked on the inside, both wings in the order were bloody red inside. Also the beef enoki roll was undercooked. Overall nice new AYCE place but not in a convenient location."}
{"text":"This place tastes great. Nice decor. The washrooms have bright, high ceilings, very clean and eclectic. Downside is that everything is fried or uses peanut oil. 

***Not safe for nut-free patrons."}
{"text":"I was extremely upset with this place that I myself, and my family have been regular customers of. We have been regulars of the August 8 Oakville location for nearly 4 years. I think pretty much since it has opened. As many other reviews have stated, the service here has always been a little rude, however it was tolerable because the food was decent. That all changed a few weeks ago.

While eating one of the roles that they had made, my daughter found a hair in one of her dishes. It threw me off however I was willing to give this place a bit of the benefit of the doubt, however within 10 minutes I found another long hair in my own food. At this point I I lost my appetite completely. When the waiter came by which was very slow and infrequently, I mention the hair in my food and then he went to go get his manager. The manager of the restaurant then comes over to our table and explains to us that it couldn't have possibly been a hair from their kitchen staff. I then proceeded to tell him that I'm not going to be eating what's on my table. The manager of the restaurant then tells me I have to eat what's left on my table and whatever food portions Ive left uneaten, I have to pay for. I agreed to pay my bill but I refused to pay for the leftover portion of food. He then calls the police, the police walk in I told the entire story of my history with them including how often we frequent this place and we have held birthday parties within my family at this location. The officer instructed me to pay the bill which I did and I did not have to pay for the leftover food. 

It's a shame really because I used to love the short ribs at this place. However with or without the police, the hair in my food and the rude service confirmed prior to the arrival of the police officers that I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, sashimi and tenderloin was amazing :). For desert the sponge cake is delicious as well."}
{"text":"First time here didn't know what to expect especially the last place there didn't do too well.. but overall food was very good.. took some time for the dishes to come out but they are worth it I suggest their beef tenderloin and asparagus wrapped in bacon.. dinner price was  $26.99 a bit expensive for an ayce but at the end alot of their dishes are really worth it.. and their sashimi are fresh and they serve them in thick slices. I would go back for a special occasion"}
{"text":"I love the iPad concept. So easy and your meal comes out quickly. I wish we had something like this back home.. definitely coming back if I'm in the area again. Be hungry and be ready to eat if you go here!"}
{"text":"This is the most ripped off dimsum sushi restaurant ever. The hostess took us to the table without explain to use if this is a all you can eat or Per order place. Without much instruction with menu table on the table. We thought just pay for how many items you picked. We picked 1 order siu mai 1 pork bun which is the size of my thumb , 1 shrimp dumpling , 2 pc of salmon 1 pc eel sushi's poor quality food without any drinks cost us about $47 after waited more than 5 minutes after requested for the bill until we literally went to the cashier then finally someone show up to help. Worst scammed in my life."}
{"text":"The service here stands out for me from other Peel ayce sushi joints!

With a few additional dim sum options and special features it's menu options are similar to most others.

Quality is still good, but time will tell after a few months. 

Sashimi was fresh and thick

Decor is gorgeous to look at. 

Hope the furniture and cutlery maintains its shape!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and boy was I embarrassed by everyone! They announced to THE ENTIRE ROOM WHO I WAS, GAVE ME A BALLOON AND MADE EVERYONE SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I was laughing the entire time because I got a great gift which was food, and I was overjoyed with how well the staff were checking up on my table every few minutes inbetween to ensure everything was okay. A plus for customer service! They lose a star with pricing though. I understand AYCE places can be a tad bit expensive but I can't justify having to spend nearly $30 for an entire dinner per person so they lose a star for that. However, despite the expensive pricing, their dinner menu is very diversified and most of their items actually have reminded a friend of mine what Japanese sushi tastes like, so brownie points for that! The other thing I really enjoy is the ability to call your server if you have any issues, or to send your meal without having to wait for a server to do so! This not only speeds up the process, but makes everything much more smoother. The other issue I've had other than the pricing is that this place only accepts credit cards or cash. On the bright side however, there is an ATM right outside in the waiting area so you can withdraw money. Overall, I will have to save up quite a bit before I do revisit for a dinner service, but I am rather satisfied with the entire experience!"}
{"text":"I think the general concensus of 3.5 accurately depicts the restaurant.

If I were to describe the restaurant, I'd probably say it's 'amazingly okay'.

They had a larger selection of dim sum than any other restaurant I've been to.  But the only ones I wanted were shrimp dishes (shrimp wonton and rolls).  They were...pretty okay.

Their rolls, standard, although they did have this one deep fried cream cheese roll that was quite nice. Again not amazing, but nice. Spicy salmon (my benchmark) had a little more tempura than I like. But nowadays, what ayce doesn't?

Kitchen items were... forgettable for the most part, in that I can't seem to remember what we ordered in that department. 

There was a line in SpongeBob in the episode where the Krusty Krab gets bought out by Krabby O'Mondays, and the manager explains to Mr.Krabs that 'our customers are quite content with the contrived and mediocre', where a fish takes a bite and falls asleep at the table...

Honestly I feel like that accurately summed up my experience there."}
{"text":"Kind of meh food overall. Nothing special. They do have pan Asian, so if you want a bit of selection you get it, but none of it is terribly good. It's definitely decent, but if you're used to great dim sum, great teriyaki great sushi, or great Korean food, this is middle of the road on all fronts."}
{"text":"Solid four stars from me, but temper your expectations. This isn't a high end sushi restaurant that managed to provide high quality sushi at competitive AYCE prices. This is still AYCE food. It tastes good, and you will get full. That's all I'll guarantee.

What this place gets stars for is everything else. Location is great, it has a street-facing unit at BCC. Interior is classy and the whole place has a consistent theme. Servers are nice and accommodating. Most of all, the service is quick!

My biggest gripe with AYCE places is the service wait times. It can really make or break your meal having to wait 20+ minutes for an order, then suddenly getting bombarded with everything at once. Why do you think so many AYCE sushi places have so much food wasted? AYCE restaurants should really take a tip from the trendy tapas restaurants and just serve things as they're made.

The best thing about August 8 is that for the most part, they seem to follow this advice! Within a couple minutes of ordering from their iPads, you'll start receiving dishes. It's truly such a difference maker."}
{"text":"Returned for a follow up visit. Sadly there are inconsistencies with their food. Ratio of rice to protein in the nigiri has increased. Sushi rice wasn't as flavourful as before. Overall the dim sum items were lacking the well seasoned delights from our previous visit. It's definitely not 'bad', more in the realm of average."}
{"text":"A certifiable find of the Dim Sum variety. Completely opposite to what's on offer in the other downtown China town restaurants, this place is clean, well designed, has interesting servers, very passable dim sum. AND its AYCE! 
Granted there no outrageously weird choices in the dim sum cornucopia, but I really stick to choices of things I regularly eat anyway. You could go so far as chicken feet, in fact you can have my share. Its iPad ordering, so you hasv e pictures of whats going to arrive.  Majority of the service staff are Asian with accents, but really all they are asking is do you want your drink refilled. I imagine the glasses are bottomless. Only downside for me was that I ordered so much dim sum, I had to bypass a lot of the sushi, which was very serviceable. Was seated next to the entrance to the washroom and couldn't smell anything washroomy, which was apleasant change. They have other locations, so its likely this won't be a short lived operation."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! First time coming to a dim sum restaurant and was incredibly satisfied with their unlimited option. Literally, you can continue ordering as long as you're hungry. You order on an iPad that sends your request directly to the kitchen and it comes out within 5-7 minutes. No waiting for a waiter to come and take your next order. I think it would be a little difficult with a larger group using one iPad but it was just two of us and was PERFECT. The quality of the food was fantastic and so delicious. The overall ambiance of the space was chic and cozy. It was $30 for unlimited dinner on a Sunday but we were told they have lunch prices during the week for unlimited that are $19. Highly recommend the beef teriyaki, the sweet and sour chicken roll, the tempura yam roll, and the spicy dragon roll! YUM!"}
{"text":"Wow what fun!  I first heard about this place from Groupon,  almost a two for one deal,  so I decided to give it a try.  
There is something so entertaining about ordering food from an iPad at the table.  
The selections were great,  something for everyone.  I got all my favorites and tried some new stuff aswell.  
The service was fast!  A few minutes after I sent my order to the kitchen,  the wait staff was bringing out our dishes. 
Flavours were excellent, quality was great,  everything seemed very fresh.  
Loved the mango ice-cream for dessert!  
I would come back again for sure,  infact,  before I was done my first round of tastings I bought a second Groupon to go back!  
This place is a little expansive without any sort of discount, but a good place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"A 2.5/5 experience for me. The quick service and the presentation and atmosphere of the restaurant was what saved the rating. I came with a friend to try out the new Spadina location and was disappointed.  

The dim sum was below average. I ordered the siu mai, har gow and the deep fried shrimp dumplingd. The siu mai wasn't chewy and the meat felt like it wasn't grounded properly. The har gow was worse with its hard and dry outer shell but the shrimp filling was alright. The deep fried shrimp dumpling was more shell than filling so all I tasted was the crunchiness of the shell.

I ordered the spicy salmon, manga crab roll and salmon and butterfish sushi. The sushi was good but not the best as I've had fresher sushi elsewhere. 

Then we ordered the yam and crab stick tempera. The yam tempera was too oily to actually enjoy it. It was so oily that the tempera kept slipping from my chopsticks...

For dessert, we had ice cream and my friend ordered the mango pudding. The ice cream was good but my friend didn't like her mango pudding. She said the top of the pudding tasted good with the manga flavor but as she go to the bottom of her cup then it was just jelly so she was fairly disappointed.

We each paid ~$23-4 with tip for lunch and for the price I paid, I could find better food elsewhere. I really had high expectations for this price considering the great things I heard about the other location but I can't justify coming back here with the price + better AYCE choices out there in Toronto."}
{"text":"All you can eat place with both sushi and typical dimsum fare offered. Price is on the upper end of AYCE, given that they have 2 types of food here. Their sushi is typical for AYCE quality and they don't pile on the rice. Their dimsum is actually quite good and is on par with some other Chinatown dimsum establishments. Staff were attentive and unlike some other AYCE places, all of our orders (via the ipad) actually arrived!"}
{"text":"Price is super high just go on special occasions! Their ipad gets annoying as it freezes often and you have to turn it to get it to work again.  The servers are really nice. However when it is so busy it's hectic. Twice this has happened, we did our first round of orders...waited 20 minutes only to find out the kitchen hasnt accepted our orders yet. We didnt want to keep ordering while we waited to avoid getting too much food. The server finally came to us and let us know that our order wasnt accepted and apologized. Just wish they had Vegetarian dumpling options most of them are meat and seafood dim sum."}
{"text":"I will say from the get-go that I would probably give August 8 an extra star if the value was there. The food is good but I feel that $28.00 per person ($26.00 on weekdays) is quite expensive compared to other AYCE sushi places I have tried in the GTA. The price doesn't even include tea, which I found a little crazy.

Clean and modern restaurant interior. Ordering via iPad at the table is convenient, and it's nice to see photos of the menu items. Tempura was great, thin crispy batter and not too greasy. Dim Sum was quite forgettable--wouldn't recommend it. Sushi was fresh, and had good flavor. They also have Sapporo on tap.

The service could be improved upon a bit--we had to ask for more water a few times, asked for wasabi and ginger twice (which was brought out in one small bowl that was not easy to share). To be fair though, everything we ordered on the iPad came out quickly. 

All in all, I will go back, but for lunch instead as the price is almost $10.00 cheaper for the same AYCE menu."}
{"text":"I'd say this is more dim sum place rather than sushi. I've tried their steamed pork shiu mai and shrimp dumplings that I liked. Good for AYCE place - portions size isn't large so you don't overeat. 
The broth of seafood udon soup was just right that I needed at the moment.
Shrimp tempura and deep fried shrimp dumplings were my favorite just because I love shrimps:) but dumplings were also crispy and tasted perfect with mayo.
Yet rainbow roll and tuna sushi were disappointing. Tuna didn't seem fresh.
So I'd say that is place to go for AYCE dim sums and other stuff like that but probably not for sushi.
But the servers were friendly and not annoying. Food was served quickly. The restaurant is clean and well-maintained. 
Probably I'll be back but not for sushi:)"}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time on a Groupon deal (they have several locations across the GTA).  It's a spacious AYCE restaurant.

Order on the IPAD (don't get trigger happy and over order!) and the food comes out surprisingly quick

They've got everything- rolls and rolls and rolls of  Sushi, sashimi, noodles, chicken wings, Korean beef ribs, seriously the list is endless- you'll be scrolling for days.  There are plenty of vegetarian options as well so fear not! 

The quality is ok - not the best but pretty good - especially if you get the Groupon!  

You'll be rolling right out of here at the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"I would say dine in is definitely a better deal, as AYCE prices and quality are on par. 
We wanted something quick for lunch and opted to try their delivery, as we were curious about the dim sum delivery portions vs the dine in.
As with all delivery adventures (free within a certain radius) the experience has its up sides and its down sides . The dim sum is sadly disappointing in size, as it is the same bite size portions served in the restaurant for roughly $4, Not bad, but not great.
The dinner set however is excellent. For $13.50 it comes with a generous portion of teriyaki chicken, tempura (2 shrimp, 4 veg), rice, miso soup and California roll, making for a reasonably priced, filling meal.
In all, both dine in and delivery have been a good experience thus far.

2nd Delivery :-
Decided to try something different.
Mango Chicken Bento. A very cute Bento container and delicious. Mango chicken (lightly battered white meat with mango sauce, no mango pieces sadly), rice, great veggies (sweet peppers, zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms) and miso. Definite winner."}
{"text":"This was my first ayce sushi AND dimsum place I've ever been to and it was pretty good. The dimsum selection is quite small but they have the basics. The har gow was delicious for a ayce place,siu mai is small... my friend ordered 3 chicken feet !!! He later got one with his ice cream desert lol! Overall it was a good experience, a nice restaurant! I'd definitely take a date or my family here. 
Atmosphere 5/5
Service 5/5
Food 4/5 

P.s it's near H&M entrance of bramlea mall."}
{"text":"Sushi was just okay. Rice was overly starchy. It's not as fresh as other sushi places in town. The shiu mai was great though."}
{"text":"This was my first time visit.  Everything's average including food, service and atmosphere.

It is a sushi restaurant but serving dimsum as well.

iPad menu seems to be a trend but I still prefer paper menu or at least everyone of us are provided with one."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of August 8 and the parking lot in Burlington scares you, the Oakville location is your spot. A quick jog off the QEW. And a Goodlife nearby to hit after to assauge your guilt."}
{"text":"We went there as a group of 7 and booked reservation beforehand. The food came quickly, but the taste was mediocre for its price ($40 after tax and tips). 

This is a sushi and dim-dum AYCE restaurant, but honestly if you want to try dim sum, just go to somewhere else in Chinatown. Also, there were not too many sashimi selection. One of the things I like is the salmon and tuna tataki.

Last but not least, the service was not good. The sever did not take the plates on time, probably because the restaurant was full. At the end, when we were about to pay and one of the waitress was cleaning up the table, she took a bowl and the soup in the bowl spilled my friend's pant. It is understandable as long as you apologize, but she didn't say anything and just give my friend some napkin. Eventually they didn't charge my friend's $5 tip, but this wasn't a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"After reading about this online (NARCITY) I was really excited to try it out. I love dim sum, sushi, and the value seemed great. It was a really big let down. 

Nothing was bad, but nothing was excellent. My overall thoughts on the food is that everything was mediocre. We tried a lot of the dishes (albeit nothing with pork, so I can't speak to those dishes) and it was all...ok. Portion sizes were good - I always prefer smaller portions with AYCE because that you can always order more if it's not enough. I'm glad nothing that came out was too big because I don't know that I wanted more of anything (except the beef enoki, which wasn't GREAT but I just had a hankering for beef enoki that day). 

The restaurant itself was clean and bright. They had Drake playing on repeat the entire time. (No complaints there. Shoutout to Drake if you read random Yelp reviews!)

Ultimately I look forward to my bimonthly dim sum Sunday brunches and this one felt like a bit of a waste. If you want good dim sum, go to a place that just does dim sum. Same goes for sushi."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricier side and the service is a bit slow (it does pick up the minute it gets busier, lol) but food wise-- solid. 

Their dim sums aren't the best but their food is really decent both in quality and presentation. The butterfish sashimi I ordered was very cold; probably just finished defrosting, but the salmon slices are adequate and not at all fishy. The torched sushi seems to be slathered in some kind of cream and was very reminiscent of sweet onion sauce from Subway or Kraft dressing. Nonetheless, I didn't mind it as it actually tasted good.

The only real issue I had was that I had to ask for wasabi and ginger... kind of weird considering that those are things that should already be on the table when you are first seated. Also, the plates and bowls need a little bit of cleaning. 

As per the washrooms, they are all singles (no stalls) they are kept neat and tidy. The soap smells like melons so that's always delightful. 

All in all, try to come out during dinner to get the most out of their menu considering they don't have a huge selection during lunch. Servers are younger and not as attentive but they are doing their best so that's what counts to me (from one millennial to another).

I came here with 0 expectations and the restaurant surprised me. Overall, it's a decent place with nice ambience and mainstream music playing in the background. It will get you your sushi fix but mind you, if you are a teeny bit of a sushi snob, it might disappoint."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon lunch deal for 2. The restaurant was nicely decorated, the food arrived quickly and it was delicious. We had a few order mix ups but they were quickly resolved. I'd come back with another Groupon deal."}
{"text":"Great service, great vibes, great food!

With the fusion of sushi and dim sum in one place, August 8 is one of the most unique and best all you can eat sushi places to go to. Like many other locations, orders are all done through an iPad placed on the table. The sushi came out fairly quick, but the dim sum dishes took a bit longer to come. The presentation was splendid and the sizes of the rolls were perfect. They offered four ice cream flavours: mango, green tea, vanilla, and chocolate. The mango had a very fresh taste to it, very similar to a mango slushie. Their dessert menu wasn't as limited as other places. Overall, great place and I will definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to satisfy that \"I want lots of food and flavour\" urge especially if you're craving sushi with some dim sum too!

been meaning to try this place for a long while, but could never make a trip out to Brampton to make it work. I regret it because this place was an amazing spot for lunch!

located in the Bramalea City Centre off Dixie and Queen in Brampton this place features a very modern looking architecture inside and out with a patio facing north. Parking is always a challenge as this is connected to a mall but if you're lucky to land a spot then you're halfway there. Next part is getting that prayer you're living by landing a table.

They use a very efficient and clean iPad ordering app that's different than most places and fast. staff is young and happy to help.

food

lots of selection at lunch including a full dim sum selection, sushi and maki and classic AYCE items from the grill. I posted some pictures but if done correctly the Raindrop roll is a great combination of Mango, Avocado, Cream cheese, crispy, savoury and sweet. that's a must try.

staff

very accommodating and very quick on order delivery with kitchen working very fast. only part that kinda lacked was in getting the bill. took 10min for our simple split request but otherwise a great experience.

They allowed us to use my groupon for a group of 4 and that resulted in a $10 AYCE lunch for our whole group. loved that.

summary, this is probably the best place of its kind in the area and a great place to end up for lunch or dinner. 4.25 out of 5"}
{"text":"If you are super hungry, looking for variety and want great customer service - this is the place to go! We have been going to August 8 for a while now, we used to drive out to Hamilton for their food because we are such fans. They offer a great variety of items which include flame torched rolls, dim sum, noodle/rice dishes, tempura and sashimi. Some of my favourites are the tripe, flame torched rolls, their salt and pepper wings and they have a delicious steamed sponge cake which I always order for dessert. They are fast and efficient and their price are comparable with other buffets. Great dining experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 a-- If you are super hungry and looking for lots of variety, August 8 is a great choice. Out of the many buffets out there, I find their service and products are consistent. They offer flam torched rolls, sashimi, hand rolls, noodles/rice, fried chicken and even dim sum to show their variety. A few of my favourite items are their tripe, shrimp dumpling, flames torched rolls and salt and pepper chicken wings. They also have a steamed sponge cake which I love. If you are in the area, pop by to give it a try."}

Curry squid (small portions, so order more)
Scallop roll
Red Dragon roll
Beef dishes, it's tender

I heard that the mango and chocolate ice creams are good, but I didn't try them.

AYCE is not something I actively pursue. This is good because of the versatility of the small dim sum menu. You can order 100 shots of salmon sashimi if that's your usual AYCE sushi style, but I chose to slurp 60 curry squid instead.
Everything is in the mediocre to good range.

We had a huge group and they sat us at one long table. It worked quite well, and the wait staff generally brought everything in the right region, but often we would have to call out to see which dishes belonged to which person. It wasn't too bad.

Ordering is both easy and hard. The menu is very clear and easy to use. However, because it's on an ipad, it can be tough for everyone sitting at the table to see at once. They would be wise to have some paper menus to supplement.

The service is surprisingly fast and friendly considering how busy the restaurant is and the nature of AYCE ordering styles."}
{"text":"Food was good, ambience was good, service was terrible. Food items were delivered by different staff, and just sort of flung on the table. We were not told what each item was, and the food arrived sporadically. I asked for extra wasabi which never arrived. I think more staff training would easily turn this into a 4.5 star place"}
{"text":"I definitely did not enjoy this location. The only good thing about it was that the wait times are short to sit and receive your food.
My boyfriend & I ordered quite a few things, but the very first thing we received was chicken wings. The chicken wings were bloody ... So I stopped eating them and didn't get to enjoy them as I hoped.
The tempura shrimp was good, everything else was fine. 
While we were eating, our plates were overcrowding the table so I stacked my plates up and left them on the side for the server to come get. Someone kept coming, but only picked up my boyfriend's plates so my side was getting more fuller. Finally, near the end my boyfriend could tell I was super irritated with the place, we just paid our bill.. I would've at least tipped 10% but the machine allows the lowest amount to be tipped is 12%. 
I would definitely go back to August 8, but perhaps the Burlington location ... Not this one at all.

{"text":"Great foods.. fresh and friendly services
My kids love to go here. There's always something for them to choose.  Beed udon is so tasty. Our favorites"}
{"text":"August 8 is a damn confusing name for a restaurant. But yet, the food is fantastic here. Located in the Bramelea City Centre mall, you will find plenty of parking spot. Staff are attentive and friendly. And the food selection is amazing. Dim Sum, sashimi, sushi, hot items... the list go on and on. You get to order it on an iPad and send it directly to the kitchen so no time wasted. My favourite item on the menu is the blow torch salmon. YUM!! Just thinking of it makes me hungry. They also offer dessert but tea is extra. The good thing about it located in the mall, is that when you're done with your meal, you can always go for a walk in the mall to digest! 
Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.   Nothing wrong with it just not so incredibly good as to be worth the cost in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been to the Oakville and Hamilton August 8, I'd say this one is my favourite. I came here on a weekday for lunch AYCE,  the servers are nice and attentive, food came out at a reasonable time, hot foods came out hot and nothing tasted cold or stale. The only complaint is they give you big rice portion in the sushi (but I feel like majority of AYCE places are like this). The mall entrance is kind of hidden and hard to find, I went in from the outside. Price is pretty standard for AYCE, atmosphere is nice, decor is classy, overall I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch the other day with some friends and was not disappointed. I mean nothing stood out to make this place exceptional but for an AYCE sushi and dim sum restaurant, the food and service was great. It was 18.99 plus tax, which came about $21 so not too bad considering its all you can eat and they have a variety of stuff. I am obviously not a dim sum expert so I do not know the standards that people have for the dumplings and such but personally I found the shrimp dumplings to be alright and the sushi to be good but my friends and I really enjoyed the foods from the appetizers and tempura section the best. I do not remember all the rolls we got but we pretty much stuffed ourselves with the appetizers that when the actual sushi came it was hard for us to genuinely enjoy the rolls. Nonetheless, I think this is a pretty cool spot to check out if your in the area or if you are in the mood for some ayce sushi,  but you could probably find better!"}
{"text":"August 8 is by far the most unique AYCE restaurant for sushi & dim sum! You have to come here HUNGRY in order to try all the food items they have to offer!  

This place had a great atmosphere. I liked how the dark furniture contrasted with the white ceiling which gave a modern vibe throughout the restaurant. I think the best part was their menu was on the iPad! Who said you can't have technology on the dinner table ?!! The only thing I wasn't too fond was the seating. We were seated at a 2 people table (party of 2). It was a bit squished and the table was way too small to occupy all the food items. At the end, it was still managable.

Their service was on KEY! I don't know how they do it but everybody worked so efficiently. Once you clicked on the \"SENT\" button, food will come non-stop!! The servers were all very friendly and helpful! Even though the restaurant was very busy, they still managed to occasionally check on us to make sure we were satisfied with everything.  

The food were all mouth watering and delicious  ! I loved the wide range of food! They have hot grilled food to sushi rolls to devour! I was especially surprised by the freshness of the salmon and white tuna. The dim sum were soo tasty, the BBQ pork bun was soo tiny and cute! It was toooo delicate to eat!!! They also have variety of cooked food. I really enjoyed their chicken skewers! It was seasoned so well! They also had a wide range of dessert from ice cream to custard buns . I think what really stood out  for these dishes was the presentation! The dishes were all beautiful presented! Some of them were too pretty to eat!!!

I really didn't expect much from an AYCE restaurant but August 8 really knock out all the other AYCE restaurants. They are setting higher standards for AYCE restaurants.

August 8 is a MUST TRY AYCE restaurant ! All your sushi and dim sum cravings will be met at this restaurant ! I'll definitely revisit this place and bring more friends along!!! ^^ Next time, I'm definitely getting  a bigger table ! ;D"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Dim sum quality reminds us of Mandarin buffet and the choices were limited. The rice on the sushi and rolls was hard (feels like it had been sitting there for quite some time). Sashimi's seems fresh. The vegetable udon was tasty and very flavourful. The ice cream (we tried chocolate, mango and green tea) was delicious unlike many AYCE places where they serve cheap quality ice cream. Service was okay, someone greeted us as soon as we walked in. It took them awhile to clean up empty plates on our table. I would not go back again."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and I love it. Specifically because of their blow torched salmon sushi. The seats are booths which is nice! My first visit was with a party of seven and my second visit was with my bf and the service was fairly quick. This place is your average AYCE however what differs them from other AYCE that I've been to is that they have the blow torched salmon sushi. From what I remember, to enter and exit the restaurant you have to go through the mall which can be an annoyance. Overall, I've had good experiences and I would come back."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times, food are good, services are good as well when it's not busy. Their roll and sushi is yummy! I specially like the spicy butter fish sushi, great amount of spice and don't feel fishy . Cook food is hit and miss some times. Salmon belly is delicious. Chicken skewers are always good. Dim sum , shrimp dumplings are good."}
{"text":"Service was great. My bestie and I went last night for dinner. Food was delicious. It combined our two favorite things..dim sum and sushi. The deep fried octopus wasn't that great though. My fav was the spicy clam roll."}
{"text":"Service was reasonable. Sashimi not available for lunch. Food was bland. A little noisy. Lunch was $21 per person."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY AYCE place that serves sushi & dimsum. If you want to try something new, then this is the place.

Most lunch days are $18.99 while dinner timeslots are $28.99. The price is within reason. Sashimi on the other hand is for DINNER-ONLY and because I did not try that I cannot speak for its value for the extra money.

Dimsum and sushi are all fairly standard quality. The quality for dimsum here were especially good. Miso soup is okay. The desserts are 1-scoop a cup. They're like a shot-size.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with my experience, and I would recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Good quality AYCE sushi is really hard to find, and I guess August 8 wasn't my favorite joint. They separate Lunch and Dinner prices, and sashimi was only part of dinner, but you can order it anyway during lunch hours if you just pay $30 instead. 

Service was okay, the place was quite empty when we went in but everything was rather slow-paced. I like the iPad ordering system but our orders got mixed up a lot, we always got either too much food or too little at a time. 

I think the meat and dim sum was pretty average, and the rolls weren't my favorite. I did, however, REALLY LIKE the SASHIMI! It wasn't very big but it did taste fresh and delicious. I love white tuna so it's nice to find a place where you can have unlimited portions. 

I would not come back, just because I only liked one option out of everything they had, and I didn't think the price justified the experience."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first night and I can honestly say that it would also be the last. Nothing about this place stood out to me other than the concept. Everything was average and not worth the trip. 

- Service was good and attentive so props to them for that. 4/5 

- Dim-sum items took a bit longer to come out than the sushi, which was alright with me since none of my orders went missing. But other than that, they were alright. 3/5

- The sushi were just like any other sushi you get at AYCE, nothing was good or bad. However, the kitchen should pay more attention to the amount of vinegar they put in the rice because I tasted more vinegar than anything else. 2.5/5 
 
Overall, in my opinion, it was not worth the trip since I expected more from them seeing how \"high-quality\" the restaurant looked and the price you pay for. They need to step up their game since there are other restaurants that offer better price for the same quality or even better sushi than them."}
{"text":"Catering more to individuals that enjoy some asian flavours but do not want to eat lots of raw fish is August8 sitting just a bit north of Spadina and Dundas.  The menu and ordering system are on tablets which is definitely ideal to see a picture, ingredients and serving size of what is being ordered. Selections are good but limited (e.g shrimp dumplings, Japanese sushi pizza and torched rolls rather than rice rolls, salmon pinwheel rolls, glutenous rice ball desserts and japanese desserts).  The food came out fast in small dishes or steamer baskets a few mins after ordering.  Portion sizes are just right so that you get a few bites rather than overly full from 1 or 2 noodles or rice bowls.  

Recommendations:
- torched rolls, dumplings (each are a small bite, good flavour and wrapping is a good thiness), desserts, fried squid, beef ribs

Pass on:
- sushi pizza (batter was fried solid unless you like extra crunchy), noodle and some rice bowls (common flavours no special creations) and ice cream

Overall, ambiance was great and seating was comfortable, staff was attentive and food was good and very fresh.  An improvement I can suggest is to make sure food comes out pipping hot.  Ours came slightly over warm except for the custard sponge cake dessert which was so hot it was steaming!  Also, perhaps it was because I went with a friend on a week night instead of Friday or weekend but we sat for almost 1.5 hrs and was not rushed at all until the end when we started ordering desserts.  We were going to order more than one item but staff already quickly cleared the table of utensils and dishes.  If it was with another group of friends (who enjoy going back and forth from mains and desserts, this rush would not have been received well).  

Would I go back?  Maybe but if selection increases and food temp was improved.  For $28.99 M-T dinner, it was a bit pricy."}
{"text":"This is one of the most enjoyable sushi restaurants I have been to, to date. It's delicious, the food comes fast and it is amazing. Today I ordered from delivery for the first time from here and it is so yummy and packed with such care. I recommend this place to all my friends. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Group of friends bought groupon to try out this AYCE that serves dimsum and sushi. We are not disappointed.

Place is nice and clean. Staff are friendly and service is quick. We called in advance for a group of 17 people and when we arrived, table are all prepared and ready.

Food continuously served and I would say everything we ordered came. Sashimi were sliced thickly. Although some sushi came not properly done, taste wise its good. Dimsum have a huge variety and taste good. Love the mini bbq bun and xiao long pao, they were made miniature version which I don't really mind.

Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Came here after previously experiencing the other locations in the GTA. The food was definitely mediocre compared to the other locations.
While eating some shrimp dumplings I found a piece of sharp plastic while I was chewing. Could have been a disaster. We were offered a 10% discount after alerting the servers. Definitely not enough for something like this."}
{"text":"This is my first time here at August 8 and I was not disappointed. I am definitely satisfy with the quality of food, the staff was attentive and patient, food arrived very fast and efficient, great atmosphere and clean environment (lighting is dimly lit enough to see your food but at the same time feels very cozy), price is reasonable. I love the ipad concept for ordering the food which includes pictures, it is very helpful and easy. I can't list everything I had for dinner because it's to many to list (I practically order one of everything on the menu) Every dish that came out was delish..I ordered seconds for some of the items. Oh...I also like the fact that after I finished my meal we sat in the restaurant for an additional 45 minutes and the staff did not make us feel that they want us to leave. I will definitely be a repeat customer and I tend on coming here for dinner at least once a month. It's rare that I give any restaurant review a 5 stars but this one sure deserves it."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place we've been to yet.

I go with 3 other people and we always go for the all you can eat at dinner. We're all big sushi people so we order in hoards.
Never had a complaint yet about this place, the sushi is always brought to us within 10-20 minutes and you can tell it's fresh.
They give you the option to edit any rolls and request anything as it's all ordered through an iPad (no more waiters forgetting to input your order)

We've gone here every week for the past 3 weeks and we plan on going back with more people !"}
{"text":"WHATT! ALL YOU CAN EAT $31!!! Great quality food. My new fav dim sum spot in Spadina. Service was a bit all over the place, and they screwed up twi items we had ordered off the a la carte menu. Great place overall. Will be back!"}
{"text":"2.5*  Food was better when it first opened.

I'm sad to report this, but the taste of the food has declined since my last review.  :(  Shrimp were overcooked, both shrimp/rice (in sushi) were bland, and some of the dim sum were slightly on the dry side.

Usually I'm excited to submit my next order sheet, but this time, I didn't eat as much as I would if the food was actually tasty!

Service:  We had to reorder 1-2 since some items never arrived.  Honestly, sometimes it's a GOOD thing this happens as you overeat anyway!  So I almost EXPECT this to happen at any ayce place.  No biggie unless it's a pattern.

I noticed the servers really try to push their cocktail menu...which had no prices.  Not cool, no thanks, I'll stick to water!

Service-wise, I find all the servers at August 8, both Burlington & Oakville locations, very nice and professional.  Water is always being refilled, dirty dishes are changed, empty serving plates are taken away.  So their service definitely sets them apart from other ayce sushi restaurants!  Plus *s for that."}
{"text":"Its an ok place for me. Food takes a while to come out and some of the items that are regularly served in lunch time at most ayce are served only in dinner time. Not happy. Would I come back? Only if someone else is paying for it."}
{"text":"This is definitely not a traditional dim sum place - all the waiters spoke english and looked very proper. 

The menu variety is ok - all the dim sum staples EXCEPT my favourite rice rolls. It is also helpful to note that everything here is MINI (mini pork buns, mini dumplings, mini spring rolls, etc). The quality of dim sum is surprisingly good for an all you can eat restaurant. 

There is actually a pretty good variety of maki rolls as well as sushi. The sashimi took forever though so we gave up trying to order it after a while.

Overall sunday dinner came out to 40 a pop after tax and tip which is way more than it would cost me to eat my hearts desire worth of dim sum at any chinatown joint.

I would give this place 4 stars because i didn't have too many bad things to say about the food, but the price i think is too much even comparing AYCE places."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday with a group of 11. 
Good idea to make a reservation if you have a group. We did the AYCE option. The price for lunch was 20.99++ it's Ipad ordering system. I was looking forward to dim sum but not as much selection. I also thought shishimi would be an option but I guess only for dinner. 
The dim sum was just \"ok\" the sushi had mare to choose from. 
Service was ok as well considering it got pretty packed by 1pm.  The restaurant itself was clean but seating is quite compact.
I enjoyed the eggplant, beef skewers, shrimp wonton."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a few times but after our last visit we will never return. We waited 30 minutes for Miso soup and Edamame while we watched everyone around us being served. When asked how much longer, there were no apologies only excuses. We continued to be ignored throughout the entire dinner. And to top it all off, we were all sick that night. My toddler having the worst of it. There are lots of great All You Can Eat Sushi restaurants out there, this is NOT one."}
{"text":"Since it opened this year, I have been at this location 3 times. I have frequented at the other locations when I was in Burglinton/Hamilton area.

This is my favourite AYCE sushi place with consistent fish quality. This is the only place where I do not find bones in my sashimi. The selection is varied. It seems their menu changes slightly from time to time. For example, they used to offer red bean ice cream and now they have removed and replaced it with chocolate ice cream.

However, the service is a hit and miss. There were times I would ask for water refills or more serviettes and they would forget about them.

They don't charge extra if you don't finish your order.

Overall, I would go here whenever I have a huge appetite."}
{"text":"Good selection and quality of food. I'd highly recommend to anyone trying Japanese for the first time, since you can order one piece at a time to try different things."}
{"text":"Althought this place has been open for a year it is new to me as I was expecting spring rolls. AYCE sushi in Brampton. Place is big, clean, with appropriate amount of staff. Went there during lunch time. Decent amount of folks eating and talking, kept the staff on their toes but not to the point where they were running around. Staff were friendly, it was good seeing they had good chemistry with each other as well. The food...well is the same as any other AYCE place. Nothing out of the ordinary and tasted fine. So yes, Brampton AYCE that is clean, good staff, come here"}
{"text":"So whoever thought of marrying off 2 of the world's best cuisine , Japanese Sushi and Chinese Dimsum, is a pure Genius. (Slow Clap) On the other hand it does not take a smart person to figure out that whoever does eat here will enjoy it immensely. We were a group of 16 , purchased groupon and accommodated with not a single peep of hassle. Service was a bit slow at first but when the food started coming, it just kept on going. Quality wise they serve eat-worthy sashimi. Came in fresh and sliced thick. I was even excited that for the first time they served Ika (squid) sushi as not a lot of restaurants offer this in the GTA. Though not the best that I've tried I'd still give them points for putting it on the menu. Tempura and Fried Squid were very well seasoned and fried just right NOTE not at all overcooked (yay for the kids). Now on the dimsum side, I loved the HaRGow (or Hakaw as some say) with leafy vegetable absolutely delicious and lets not forget to mention healthy too because it came with some greens :D  The steamed buns, Lo Mai Kai (sticky rice in lotus leaf), Xiao Long Pao were just as good and very cute !  They were so memorable tiniest little things you will see like cotton balls with barbecued pork inside. Just rightly so as you didnt to stuff yourself right away without sampling their other delectables."}
{"text":"We (inclusive of myself, my mother and husband) sat in a booth and were promptly greeted by a male server. We ordered beverages followed by some dinner items. About 10 minutes into our meals my husband received a phone call and needed to step out, he returned approximately 40 minutes later and was unimpressed to find us sitting with the same plates we had when he left. Our server had not returned to our table although he had walked by on at least 2 occasions. On the third I called to him and asked if we could order again, to which he obliged. Our food was brought out to us by a young woman, who refrained from taking the dirty plates piled on our table. About 15 minutes passes and our drinks are empty and servers are again nowhere to be found. I walked to the back of house area and asked for someone to come to our table. A young girl then came out, took our dessert order and removed the plates from our table as per our request. I then asked if there was a manager on duty that I could speak with regarding our lackluster dining experience. The 'manager' who presented herself was the same young woman who had brought us entrees earlier without clearing our used plates. I asked her if there was a manager I could speak with and her response was a catty, rude and obnoxious, \"WHY?\" . I explained to her that the service we received was less than acceptable and she shrugged. When I explained my dismay for an Asian inspired restaurant playing an hour and a half of Miley Cyrus music containing offensive language (did you know she has a song called \"bitch\"? I can only assume that is the name of the song considering how many times it came up), the restaurant representative then retorted with, \"So? we always play the top 40. Who cares?\" *** Side note here, top 40 has censorship rules about offensive language and I find it hard to believe since at one point we heard the music being shuffled through.                  I finalized my invigorating conversation with the server by requesting contact information for your manager to which i was told he/she has none. No phone number, email or name. Interesting.                       Feeling frustrated and annoyed, we handed the server 120$ cash for our 106$ bill and she stomped off. After waiting yet another 15 minutes we realized that she was not returning with our change and left. I do not have a copy of our receipt since it was not returned to us. Horrible experience, will not be returning or recommending this restaurant.... And I'm still waiting for response from them regarding our dinner and change that wasn't returned."}
{"text":"For AYCE, the quality is not bad but personally I prefer quality over quantity. Overall, there were a handful of hits and misses and for the price, (~$80 for 2 incl. tip and tax), I would rather go to a non-AYCE place especially now that I'm not a teenager with an unlimited appetite anymore.

Overall, the variety is plentiful. The salmon sashimi was quite fresh and the torched sushi was pretty good. Other sashimi wasn't great. The shrimp tempura was light and not too oily. The dimsum was obviously not as good as actual dimsum restaurants and I wouldn't necessarily consider this aspect a \"plus\" to a sushi AYCE restaurant - the beef tripe had very strange taste but shrimp dumplings were decent. I personally like the egg yolk buns (in dessert section) 

Service was very quick and they cleared plates fast too.
Interior is nice given new restaurant."}
{"text":"Their Dim Sum is split mainly into a dim sum offering and a sushi offering. 

Dim Sum offering (4/5) - The shrimp dumplings, chive dumplings and curry squid are delicious! If you come here with the goal to become as round as a dumpling, then this is the place! However, given that it is an all you can eat restaurant, there is a limited variety of choices compared to the choices offered at Dim Sum only restaurants. 

Sushi offering (2/5) - Oh god... the roll are absolutely disgusting. I would give them a 1 out of 5 as the fish was not fresh and the rolls are comprised of 95% rice. Their sashimi was okay, so it was a saving grace from getting rated any lower. 

Overall the experience was okay. August 8 is definitely not a restaurant that is top of mind, but one that I wouldn't mind if I am craving dim sum."}
{"text":"Actually a pretty decent AYCE restaurant.
Had groupon ($21 for lunch for two), so we only paid the taxes + tip.

They have a very nice interior, very intimate looking booths, ipad ordering. And very surprise with the speed of service!  Hope they can maintain it.

With the ipad, there's an option to call a server for assistance, and/or request for the bill. No waiting game to wait for you and the server to meet eyes / or constantly raise your hand to get their attention. Thats a plus!!!! 

Nice selection items for Lunch!! Plus, they have dimsum! which is nice. Loved their tempura items, too! Would I come back? Yes. however, regular AYCE can be pretty pricey!"}
{"text":"Came for late lunch on a Saturday and i instantly regretted for choosing this over Rol San. I must say this place is an ayce sushi disguised as ayce dimsum because the choices for dimsum is very limited. Came in and no one assist us until 15 mins later a server came and asked \"oh no one gave you water?\" 20 mins after ordering, the first 4 pieces of salmon and tuna sushi came out with a bowl of Udon soup despite the fact that we ordered dimsum once we seated ourselves. The udon soup was actually decent and chewy udon noodle texture. Sushi quality is expected at any other ayce sushi. We asked 3 servers in total to go check on our order and no one came with a proper explanation. So i asked them to get us the bill and willing to pay for what we ate which is 10 pieces of sushi and and tiny Udon bowl which came up to $21 after tax. I was so hungry and dissapointed so i didnt check the bill. But even more upset when supervisor/manager gave us the bill without saying sorry or explain but simply told us that he knew about the situation so we only charged by this amount."}
{"text":"I like the foods here. It's fresh especially the sashimi. I love the iPad ordering. We went there tonight as group of 11. The foods come very up fast and quick. The servers are nice and friendly.

This place is all you all eat Sushi + Dim sum"}
{"text":"I've read many positive reviews about this restaurant so I finally had the chance to go there for dinner earlier today.

It looks very modern; there are booths along the walls, wooden tables & chairs in the middle on a checkered floor. Their washroom was very clean with private stalls (and I mean doors that go to the floor and not show your shoes haha) 

iPads are provided if you're going for the AYCE option (there is also a spot for the iPad to hang on to especially since their tables a slightly small for the 2 people booths) 

I enjoyed majority of the food that was ordered except for the salmon sashimi. Yes, the pieces were thick and appealing, but it lacked flavour which was disappointing because I love salmon sashimi! Their sashimi selection is very limited so far but there are more in the sushi section. 

Other than that, the blow torched red dragon roll was delicious. The steamed custard bun was a yummy warm treat. If you love red bean ice cream, theirs tastes more fruity than creamy which is very odd but the green tea ice cream is just right. 

It wasn't super busy when I went so I appreciated the fast service."}
{"text":"We visited August 8 for the first time last week. The restaurant is quite large, clean and nicely decorated.

We had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table at 1 p.m. on a weekday, which I took as a good sign!

We were seated and our drink order was taken promptly. We perused the iPad and submitted our order.

The food came out quickly and most of it tasted pretty good. It was fairly standard fare for an all-you-can-eat Japanese/dim sum restaurant. The teriyaki/teppanyaki chicken and beef dishes were a bit overcooked and dry, but the flavour was good. The soups were a bit bland, but not bad. The sweet and sour chicken roll was very tasty and so was the siu mai. The shrimp dumplings, wontons and tempura were all delicious and piping hot. The salmon belly was yummy.

The main complaint we had though was that the pork dumplings we ordered were raw in the middle. I mean, COMPLETELY raw. The wrappers weren't really cooked either, which should have tipped me off right away. But I took a big bite and that's when I realized the whole thing was raw. I called a waiter over and showed him and he said \"Oh yeah, that's definitely not cooked\" and took it away. I told him not to bother bringing any more to replace them. That was the absolute last we heard of it, which I think was a big mistake. When you serve raw (lukewarm) ground pork to customers, I think there should be an apology at the very least. Perhaps this wasn't brought to the attention of the manager and maybe I should have done that, but I know if it was my restaurant I would have either discounted the bill or offered a small gift card for a future visit.

All in all, it wasn't a bad meal, but the raw pork definitely left a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figuratively). I won't be rushing back to August 8 anytime soon."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for lunch as we were craving some dim sum. Our server showed us to our table and gave us a quick tutorial of the IPad ordering system.

Soon after, we started ordering all the dim sum dishes and sushi. I tried the shrimp dumplings, siu mai, chive dumplings, chicken feet, pork spare ribs, tripe, and curry squid. They had a pretty good selection compared to many other AYCE sushi places. Our dishes arrived piping hot and we just dug in. I was very impressed my the small portions as it allowed me to sample more things at once. I love chicken feet and ordered more of that, as well as their shrimp dumplings. The pork spare ribs and tripe seemed under-seasoned to me.

We did order some sushi but I felt as though they added way too much rice in their nigiri. 

Overall, for the price of the lunch menu at about $25 pp, it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Very average sushi place. They had a deep fried roll with corn - do not order it it was brutally terrible.  Everything was pretty standard but I wouldn't go back, better places in Oakville."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre with very few outstanding items. Service was pretty standard and .... that's about it.

Disclaimer: I'm from Toronto so I've had my fair share of AYCE sushi and this isn't on par with the quality and variety I'm used to.

There's nothing to write home about here. I've been here twice and both times I've been pretty disappointed with the food quality. My mother is strongly against coming here ever again when she's visiting me in Oakville. One of the big factors that drew me in was the dim sum menu. I was excited for the AYCE shrimp dumplings, tripe, and siu mai.

My conclusion on the dim sum menu: don't bother if you're used to Markham/Richmond Hill dim sum. Most of it seems like it's been frozen, steamed, and then served. The shrimp isn't juicy and the siu mai is bland. The only good standout dim sum dishes were the chicken feet and the tripe. If you're into these dishes, you won't be as disappointed.

The rolls are pretty good, but there are just not enough items I found interesting enough to keep trying. The only other item I re-ordered was the green tea ice cream and deep fried cheese wontons. Typically, when I go to an AYCE restaurant, I'm looking for variety in assorted food, and I didn't find it here.

Overall, I would not recommend this place and would advise my own friends to strongly consider eating elsewhere because I didn't enjoy my AYCE visit 2 times in a row. The only thing I can commend August 8 for is their sushi party plate for take-out since their rolls are decent. Don't get baited by the dim sum, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast service, efficient in speed from cleaning up to bringing the food.

No fuss in ordering with the iPad ordering system.

Fresh and exactly what you expect of an all- you- can-eat.

Good was abit too salty for my tastebuds.

Good small portions that's just right!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. Love going to this place. Amazing value for your money. I highly recommend going here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Will I come back to this place? Never again. The sushi was trash, and the dim sum tasted microwaved. This was easy. A 1 star. iPad was lagging and would freeze after every item we pressed. Trust when we go hard at AYCE sushi. Saturday afternoon after 3 had to pay for dinner. Which is fine, but for $27.99 for microwaved dim sum? Your joking? 

Here's how sushi places work now. You pick what u want, send it. The chef cooks it, the server places it on your table then you eat, the server then takes your plate away. Simple right? But which makes it difficult for the servers at August 8th is to recognize your glass is empty. I asked them 4 times to refill my glass. Until this other waitress noticed and filled my cup

Okay the food... I order everything, nothing was amazing, but more okay. It's better at another place, oh this is chewy, over cooked. the best thing about the place is when you get the bill and finally get to leave. I go to a lot of sushi spots and this spot is probably the worst I've been too. Overall everything not a great experience. And will never come back again. Believe me."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for dinner for 2 for all you can eat at August 8.  I didn't have high expectations for this place since it's a Groupon deal I'm assuming they're trying to drum up business.  First August 8 is located at Bramalea City Center Mall.  I've been to that mall before it was renovated.  Wow it now so nice and just as big as Square One and Sherway/Yorkdale.  I didn't think it would be busy so I didn't make reservations but when I call they said the wait is 20 mins to 45 mins.  Got to this massive mall and had to locate the restaurant.  I try to avoid restaurants in mall for the reason of fighting people for parking. I got there at 6:30 pm and the mall was packed.  Took me 15 minutes to find a spot.  We then went to ask for a table. They said it'll take 45 mins.    I saw that there were tonnes of empty tables in the dining area.  Not sure why they're making everyone wait. The good thing about this restaurant is that it's connected to the mall which is amazing. Only issue is you need to come back to check to see if your table is ready. They won't allow you to call to check your spot in line nor will they text you to let you know your table is ready.  Which I found very counter productive. So we roam the mall for 45 Mins and came back where our table was ready.  I told them about my Groupon which was not an issue. I went with my two 8 year daughters. So one got charged the adult price for the dinner for 2 Groupon and the other one got charged the kids price. We ordered from an iPad which I loved, very fast and efficient method.  The service was fine, we got what we needed however we had to ask a few time to get it.  I love how the items came in small quantities so they you can try one of everything.  Food was not fantastic but it was still pretty good.  I would only come back if I bought another Groupon.  I would not pay full price to eat here.  All in all an ok not horrible experience."}
{"text":"It's ok

Not the best in city but just ok!

They have the iPad selector which is good but compared to other like this they have about half of the selection!

Not like you need a million items but when you have people that come with you that don't really like sushi then you want a bigger selection of other items as well. 

The chicken wings are really good! 

Overall ok place that I would come back!"}
{"text":"3.5 Major props to the cute decor, but all in all it was an okay restaurant. Nothing was bad, but nothing made me super excited either. The portions are quite small so you do get to try pretty much everything you want on the menu without feeling like you've stuffed yourself. The Ipad ordering system is efficient enough, but the the food doesn't come out in  order. I got my sticky rice 40 minutes after I placed my order, which was strange as it was the first thing I placed. This is a good place for groups and for people who can eat a lot of sushi. They don't skimp out on rice."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi, and as a sushi lover, felt super left out since everyone I knew went here without me!  Nonetheless, I tried it and it was okay.

Once seated my friend and I noticed we were not given an ipad menu.  Our server kept walking pass by us not even acknowledging the fact we had no menu, however, she did come by and ask us what we wanted to drink lol.  Anyways asked her to give us a menu and she looked super confused and proceeded to ask us if we're doing all you can eat....um isn't this place AYCE? And why didn't she ask us this when she was walking us to our table like giiiirl I'm HANGRY just give me the menu already!

Also our food came out all at once and we were seated at a very small booth with not much room.  This was quite challenging.  There was one server that kept trying to shove a plate on the corner of my side of the table when clearly there was ZERO room. He also wasn't very bright as there was a pile of dirty dishes we neatly made for him so he can take it and make more room for our table.....

All in all,  service could use a little a work, the food was good I do prefer this place more than Heart Sushi in Mississauga.  My favourite from here is there SUSHI PIZZA! I'm not a sushi pizza person but definitely try it! Super worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. When people say \"3 time's a charm\", usually they mean something good is gonna happen, but nope. 3rd time, the quality went down. Visited on a Wednesday, not so busy afternoon.

We never have the issue of missing orders. But this time it happened. ALL of the sushi orders did not arrive. The food items did not arrive on time, some were faster than others. The quality of food also went down, they were either overcooked or just too much fat. 

I never knew squid have fat until this visit. Each bite of the curry squid had so much fat inside, that I couldn't finish. The steamed Shanghai dumplings have ZERO juice, when it used to have a little bit. The teriyaki chicken and steak both overcooked, making them hard to chew. The salmon belly has more fat compare to meat. 

I would not visit the Brampton location anymore, given this experience. However, I am willing to try the downtown location as I really like the concept of AYCE dim sum & sushi."}
{"text":"We tried this location for a late lunch/early supper during the Victoria Day long weekend. There was a Groupon deal for this location ($48 for two people, so you save $12 in total). The link is here: https://www.groupon.com/deals/august8-1 and at the time of this review, the Groupon is still available for purchase. The food was a bit inconsistent; some were really good, others not as much. It's really nice that they have dim sum and sushi options. While this wasn't the best buffet experience in my life, I'm interested in trying their downtown Toronto location.

The Good:
Their cooked foods were really nice. I especially liked their grilled short ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone and generous in portion size. The skewers were seasoned well and the beef cubes were tender. For the dim sum, we ordered siu mai, shrimp har gow, beef siu mai, bbq pork buns, the chives and shrimp dumplings, tripe, and the steamed pork dumplings. They were all a bit smaller than the average dim sum restaurant, and the bbq pork buns were cute, bite-sized portions so you can fill up on other stuff. The dim sum were a bit less flavourful as regular restaurants as well but were decent enough. 

The sashimi is also really good because they give you nice thick slices of fish. No tuna sashimi on the dinner menu but that was okay. We ordered salmon, butter fish, sea clams, and octopus. No questions with regards to how fresh they were, as they didn't leak ice water as frozen fish would when it comes to room temperature.

The Bad:
The sushi items were not too good and some were clumsily put together. The torched sushi options looked great, but they're smothered in this creamy garlic sauce. It got to be too much and made me feel a bit nauseous after having a couple pieces. That kinda knocked me out for the remainder of the meal. I don't like to waste food, but the taste was too much to keep going. Their rolls have too much rice in general and aren't balanced to give you an even bite of rice to filling ratio. The dynamite roll was fine, though the shrimp tempura is small on the inside. The black dragon roll was missing unagi on some of the pieces. The mango-cucumber roll was fine, though again, just had too much rice as filler.

Overall the experience was a solid 3/5 for me. The service is nice though they don't check in with you at the beginning of the meal as often as they could, so it took a while to get our drinks order down. The food service was really slow at first but picked up and was a steady stream as soon as the first few dishes arrived."}
{"text":"This place is about as mediocre as you can get. Upon arrival, the place is dark. Hard to see where you are walking. After being seated, we wanted to order, but the iPad was locked. It took nearly 10
Minutes to flag down someone who knew the passcode to the iPad. On to the food... the dim sum is all frozen. You can taste it. The ha gow and sieu mi tasted like something I could just defrost and microwave at home. Our sushi arrived on chipped plates and was average. It would be totally possible that the fish was a few days old. It didn't taste fresh. Dessert was on par. Overall this place is expensive, dark and the service and overall experience wasn't the greatest. I won't come here again. There are plenty of restaurants that specialize in dim sum or in sushi, August 8 does neither very well."}
{"text":"The Oakville location was a gem when they first opened, but they have gotten so busy and unfortunately the service has gone down. They often have a full house and are seem to be very short staffed during the busiest times. It is frustrating when you drop your chopsticks and have to wait 20 minutes and ask three times to get new ones. The food is great however, and the variety fantastic. It comes quickly and is hot. Love the iPad ordering system.My husband has a gluten allergy and they are able to accommodate him which is a bonus."}
{"text":"I love August 8, it's one of the fastest and officiant all you can eat I've been to. The iPads are very fast and easy to navigate. My recommendations include the pork dumplings, chicken fried rice(the best I've ever had), deep-fried cheese wonton, and banana tempura."}
{"text":"Service is okay, but the quality of food was not worth the hype. 
The one thing I absolutely love is their dim sums. I always order them all at once and make a huge stack/tower. 
 I was disappointed how the take out menu was limited comparing to the instore menu. If it's possible to take out miso soup, anything is possible."}
{"text":"It's located near Pickle Barrel inside Bramalea City Centre Mall. The place is huge and it's divided into separate sections with their own uniqueness to its decor. We sat near the area where they make sushi. The little booth for two were ideal and cute. Love how it's kind of private from another table. 

You order your dishes of AYCE on a mini iPad system. I like it how you can send in your order without getting a server like other similar places that I've tried in Mississauga. It's a fusion of dim sum and Japanese cuisine. 

What I love about it was my favourite dish was on it: beef tripe!! Yummy. Loved it til the last bit!! The dumplings were full of stuffing and didn't fall off from the dough. 

The service and speed and temperature (hot) were excellent for an Asian place. We were there for a weekday lunch ($17/ person) and it was surprisingly busy. 

The sad part is that the mango salad was very small and had no flavour to it. 
The mango pudding actually had mango pieces in it which was divine!!! 

Once you are full, walk around the mall to digest!! Or find a couch...

Verdict: oh yeah - will definitely go back!! I feel like Garfield there... hehehe."}
{"text":"Great ambient with nice decor, fast and fresh food, friendly service. Will coming back :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good value but the food was really mediocre. Nothing tasted bad really, but also nothing stood out. I like how most things were bite sized/small portioned though so you can try a lot of different things. It was fun ordering from an ipad... plus the interior was nice and clean."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with two girlfriends and we were all quite satisfied. The sushi is good quality, the other cooked food is also quite good, the service is fast and the ipad ordering is great. One of the waitresses explained to us that alot of items comes in 1 piece only which made it quite easy to order and not over eat! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Haven't posted on Yelp for a while  but I thought it would be worth it to share this positive experience I had at August 8  in BCC.

My sister and I ate here on a Friday night, and the service was great. The waiters/waitresses/management were nice and friendly.

So, at the end of our AYCE meal, out waitress comes and hands us the bill. Prior to this, I had an idea of what the bill would be. So anyways the bill came, and I paid. It seemed a like a bit much, but I didn't really think about it. So now, my sister and I are on the road to go to another store, and on our drive I say to her that I think I was over charged... But I left my receipt there (which is something I never do), and now I have no proof or anyway to look over the bill. So 15mins later, we make our way back and I go in to talk to the manager. I calmly explain the situation, and what we had gotten (two AYCE meals, two frozen drinks). The manager was nice about it, and asked what table I was sitting in, he took about 2-3mins to reprint the bill, and we looked it over together.

And it was Completely MY Fault. I didn't look at the HST. And I felt really dumb. I apologized multiple times and the manager seemed like we wasn't mad/upset with me at all.

Long story short, I thought they overcharged me for my meal, turned out they didn't and I just didn't looked at the bill properly (I still feel so dumb about this) and the manager was nice about MY mistake.

I will definitely come back here, because their food and services are good (though they are a bit on the expensive side), and I overall had a positive experience."}
{"text":"loved the fact that i didn't really have to talk to a server and just order my food. which by the way was great. AYCE dim sum/sushi."}
{"text":"The only thing that intrigued me was AYCE Dim Sum! AYCE Sushi, not so much a fan cause I don't eat the raw stuff but I don't mind the cooked stuff. AYCE places taste the same to me everywhere so I don't have much to comment on that but I liked how this place offers dim sum as well. I literally ate a lot of shiumai and the beef ones haha. This def can't compare to any other dim sum places but it's good for someone who likes dim sum and is ok with sushi.

AYCE lunch and dinners are never worth it for me when it's regular price $ as I get full really easily so it's better to buy groupons for this place. I've seen it pop up quite often online. The interior of the store is nice, very upscale looking and there's a lot of table space for food. 

You order the food from the ipad, which makes life so much easier. The order gets sent to the kitchen and you should receive your food shortly. We didn't have any issues here. Service was great."}
{"text":"I came here early February before it was promoted on blogto and social media. 

I don't really like ayce sushi because quality over quantity, but my friends wanted to go. Much to my expectations, the food was mediocre. For a restaurant whose value proposition is ayce sushi and DIM SUM, the dimsum variety was disappointing. 

The worst part about this experience was the service. We came pretty early for dinner (around 4 or 5pm), so there were only 2-3 other tables. The food runner seemed to hate life and threw our food down hard on the table. Despite this, my friends and I were having a good time, laughing and talking. Later on, one of my friends overheard the same food runner saying to her coworker something along the lines of, \"if those girls don't shut up...\". Extremely rude and unprofessional. Even if we were being loud  (which we weren't), there's a proper way to handle it. After we paid, we complained to the manager (who happened to be chilling in the booth behind us). He looked at us like a lost puppy and blankly apologized. Even management seemed like a lost cause. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've been a long term customer of August 8 starting back in 2009 when I visited their Hamilton/Ancaster locations. It is a chain restaurant that has locations in Downtown Hamilton, Ancaster, Oakville, and now Brampton. 

I visited the Brampton location 3 times before I decided to put in my review on Yelp. 2/3 times I visited I would have given it a 5/5, but one of the visits left me surprised at how rude some of the service turned out. 

Starting with the not so pleasant experience, We were a party of 7 and were promptly given our table. They came around with our drinks and we were ready to order. They have tablets from which you can order your food (which can freeze quite often - you can ask the servers on how to fix that) and so we started ordering our food. Halfway through, we started getting dishes that we hadn't ordered and so we told the servers and they would send them back. Clearly, something was wrong with our tablet and it was getting mixed up with another table's orders. We brought it to their attention a couple of times and they would take the tablet away to be fixed each time. The problem wasn't solved throughout our dinner and we continued to get dishes that we had't ordered. The servers were starting to get frustrated as well, though I can understand it wasn't their fault. One waitress, however, got very frustrated whenever we told her it wasn't our order, and proceeded to tell another waitress in front of us, in another language (that we conveniently understood) that our table was a pain and we kept sending all their orders back. Might I note that we were never rude in sending our orders back; we told them that it wasn't ours and that there was something wrong with our tablet so it was quite surprising that we received that kind of service. Needless to say, we weren't very happy and it wasn't a very pleasant experience. 

On a more positive note, the other two visits were very pleasant and the service was top notch. The food came fairly quickly despite the restaurant being very busy. Also, our waters and teas were never half empty. We were very happy with how the service went.

The ambience of the restaurant was very cozy with booths everywhere. Compared to their other locations, this is my favourite location in terms of ambience. Even though it was busy, the restaurant never got too loud and voices would be muffled. 

Menu wise, I have seen their menu grow throughout the years. They started with the basic sashimi and sushi rolls along with your basic dim sum options. Now, they have additions such as their blow torched rolls (rainbow, salmon, butterfish). I was also happy to see them move onto tablet ordering as I think it is more ecofriendly in the long run (they used to have pencil and paper orders). Their fish is fresh and tasty, rolls are of a large variety, and dim sum is on par with your regular chinese restaurant. In terms of AYCE, you probably can't get any better than that. 

Some of my recommendations on menu choices are: blowtorch salmon/butterfish/rainbow rolls, the California green salad, chicken katsu, all of their tempuras, salmon belly, mango pudding (ALWAYS). banana tempura with an order of ice cream (my favourite combination).

Overall, as I have mentioned before, I have been a fan of August 8 for years now and it is my go to place for AYCE sushi. The one unpleasant experience I had does deter me slightly, but not enough to not go back. I hope this location does well because I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm hoping this was just an off night because dinner was a comedy of errors. Ordered house red wine - not great tasting and served in a dirty glass. My son was still eating his appetizer and server whisked his plate away. I ordered chicken teriyaki and was brought salmon teriyaki. By the time the right order was brought out the rest of my party was half way done and the veggies that were served were cold. Chicken tasted old and had a weird after taste. Left hungry. :( 

The other orders were good-would suggest steak instead of chicken teriyaki. Sushi looked amazing!! Server did take 15% off our bill and didn't charge for drinks. Ambience was nice and seemed like a lot of locals eat here."}
{"text":"It has a nice atmosphere, service is speedy and the food is decent, but by no means is it high quality.  I would suggest this restaurant to someone who is very hungry and looking for food at an affordable price, or a group of friends looking to have a fun meal."}
{"text":"I visited August 8 because a family member gave it high praise and how it's better than other AYCE sushi in Mississauga. The sushi tasted fresh, the grilled items were good. Allegedly this place is known for their dimsum aspect. I thought their dimsum items were okay. To be honest I thought it was pricey for the limited items on the list. Portion size is pretty good though. I would return again if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Give this place 2.5/5 stars. My friends really enjoyed the one in Hamilton and I was excited to try August 8 for the first time in Toronto. 
We went here for lunch and they had around 15 dim sum choices and around 15 types of sushi to choose from. Their sushi was decent, the spicy salmon, spicy scallop, and spicy butterfish was ok. Was impressed to find aki (squid sushi) here for ayce. The dim sum, tempura, etc was average. 
With so many ayce choices in Toronto, I don't think August 8 is worth coming back to"}
{"text":"Great food 
Try the butter fish pizza
Tasty fresh sashimi (salmon, octopus n other assortments )

Fast service

Clean decor ( black chairs white marble table tops )

Friendly helpful staff"}
{"text":"Take-Out Confusion! My Husband and I ordered take-out from August 8, our first time eating at this restaurant. We haven't had much Japanese, and wanted to try something different. We ordered the dinner set, which included shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, teriyaki chicken and a california roll, the mango chicken dinner and the teriyaki dinner, as it was a dish we had had at other places and knew we liked.

Instead of getting it delivered, my Husband went and picked it up. When he got there, the hostess was very confused and told him the order had been sent by delivery. She had to get the manager and he was able to find the meal. My Husband returned home and we realized they had forgotten the teriyaki meal. My Husband trekked back up to the restaurant where he was told, \"Sorry, we're just really busy.\" So customer service isn't fantastic.

The teriyaki was excellent, and if we order again, I would definitely get this. It comes with some delicious vegetables and rice, as did the mango chicken. I liked the mango chicken, and also enjoyed the shrimp and vegetable tempura, all which I was trying for the first time. I did NOT like the California roll - this was also my first time having any form of sushi, so I'm not really surprised.

Over-all, I think I'd try another Japanese restaurant before going here again. The lack of organization when they were busy and the confusion over our take-out order makes me think twice of having to deal with that. But the food was good, and I'll consider them in the future."}
{"text":"First of all, food-wise, it's definitely one of the better AYCE's downtown Toronto. And it's both sushi and dim sum, my two faves. The quality of the sushi is good and I like how they make the sushi with just a good amount of rice, unlike other places that put so much rice to it to fill you up cheap. The torched sushi are also decent, I really like the Shrimp & Cheese torched sushi. The seared ahi tuna sashimi and unagi sushi also good. The siumay is ok, not the best. The har gow and curry octopus were pretty decent. 

Secondly, the iPad is convenient for ordering purposes so if you eat a lot like I do, you don't have to keep calling them to order more. They also give you the exact amount of each thing you order, as opposed to lowering it to what they presume you can consume.

The only negative I would say with this place is the unorganized entry. There is no one really responsible to get people seated and when they get busy, prepare to be ignored for the first 5 minutes when you get there. We (2 of us) asked for the bigger booth because we can eat and always have problems with tiny tables. One of the servers mumbled some excuse (obviously making things up because he was so not confident about the answer), basically saying we can't have the last booth because there's a group that reserved. No reserved sign on the booth though, there was reserved signs on some other tables. Then the third couple after us got seated at that booth, not a group and they also didn't reserve. They asked for table for 2. All the other tables were also filled with mostly couples, so i don't know what the deal is with him not letting us get the booth. So weird. We asked nicely. Anw, whatever.

The bathroom was ok and clean enough considering it's Chinatown.

If you're normally a Red Bean ice cream fan, i'd skip it if i were you. It was kind of gross, tasted nothing like red bean, more like artificial milky strawberry more than anything.

I'd come back. It's more expensive than other AYCE's, but despite it's shortcomings, i'll be back for the convenience of having sushi and dimsum together. Because Spring Rolls' AYCE food quality has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place I have been to!!! The service here is terrible, all wait staff are inattentive and not pleasant. 

We waited about 20 minutes just to be seated and there were so many empty tables that just needed to be cleaned. Mind you even after us waiting those tables still weren't cleaned... 

We continuously had to remind the staff to being wasabi/ginger and hot water for our tea. Only until practically the end of our meal did the wait staff bring what we asked. 

The food was good but due to the service I will never be returning to this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! This is a pretty good ayce sushi place. I feel like the dinner price is a little pricey - with tax and tip, it was approx $37.50 each. I'd probably come back for lunch only which is more reasonably priced in my opinion. 

- miso soup was salty 
- sashimi tasted very fresh and the pieces were quite large 
- dimsum options were really tasty - I loved the beef tripe 
- fried octopus tentacles were so good!
- fried sesame and red bean balls were very disappointing - not a lot of filling and looked a little gross
- mango jello dessert wasn't that sweet

Overall not a bad place. Food was pretty good."}
