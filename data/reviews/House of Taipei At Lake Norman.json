{"text":"I used to frequent House of Taipei and always loved their buffet. This evening my girlfriend and I thought we would give their takeout a shot.  We got the basics, General Tso's chicken, Sesame chicken, and a couple egg rolls.  First, my girlfriend ordered via phone. The woman taking the order was not very friendly. Apparently everything comes with white rice, and to get fried rice or lo mein you have to order it separately. It's a Chinese place. Fried rice should be a staple. I drove to pick our order up. $28. Not knowing exactly what was ordered I accepted the price, took our food and left. What we got was two small portions of Soggy chicken, two small containers of white rice, and two egg rolls. All for $28. Sorry, but if I'm going to pay $28 for takeout I'll start going to PF Changs."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food is just so-so and the service is adequate.

In my opinion the prices are ridiculous for a Chinese food restaurant. 

We have crossed this one off of our list and only consider this if everything else in the area is busy."}
{"text":"review - house of taipei, huntersville (chinese)
the world of americanized chinese food is an interesting amalgamation of fried chicken, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, and argo starch.  culinarily problematic, in many ways.

nevertheless, it's also a spot with a very particular kind of itch.

i've searched high and low for the best back-scratcher around, and this is my answer.

i'm notoriously lazy when it comes to driving more than twenty minutes for food.  i deem the distance negligible when it comes to house of taipei.

the food arrives within moments of ordering it, and be careful!  it's still piping hot.  the vegetables are not overcooked, and the cuts of meat used are surprisingly lean.  best of all, they have an amazing vegetarian menu.  the sesame tofu is absolutely delicious.  throw in some asparagus, and you're golden.

the service can be comical.  my good friend's mother likened our server to a prison warden.  i had a moment where i felt like a certain dickens character asking for \"more\".

it's housed in a large space decorated with the requisite \"backlit waterfall\" painting.  highly glossed wood carvings take up arbitrary space here and there.

i really don't care about any of that.  what i care about is general tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, lo mein, mushu pancakes, egg drop soup, stir fried vegetables, etc . . . you name it, they've got it.

it's just damn good chinamerican food.  if i have to make excuses for the effects of imperialism on cuisine, i'll gladly do it on behalf of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with portion and taste of the shrimp fried rice. My son and I shared an order of the rice and still took some home. We will be returning and trying a different dish. Perhaps the Hunan shrimp."}
{"text":"Very good take out. New to NC and I will be happy to have this place as our go to take out spot. Only given 4 stars because I wasn't a fan of the eggroll or lomein but both were good when doctored up with some of the sauces in the other dishes. Also the restaurant's ambiance could be improved."}
{"text":"Have visited this location in the past, so this evening we decided to enjoy again. We ordered hot tea and before pouring, I noticed the cups had dried particles of something in them. When the server returned I said, \"May we get clean cups, these have something in them.\" The server looked inside the cups and in a sarcastic tone said, \"Okay, whatever you say.\" When he returned he said nothing but placed the cups in my face in a rude and condescending manner as i was to inspect the inside. Having worked in the restaurant industry for a decade, this server's comments and actions were the most unbelievable demonstration of poor customer service I have ever witnessed or experienced. We left immediately and notified the manager on the way out. We will not be back after this poor customer service experience!"}
{"text":"I visted for a Birthday Dinner on 8/16/15. Let me start off by saying the food was wonderful but......... when we all ordered our drinks the waiter brings me my cup of Dr. Pepper with a RED straw opened and put inside my cup. If any of you have ever eaten there before you know they give you clear straws wrapped in paper. So once I received my drink I asked why is this straw in my cup he proceeds to let me know \"I taste make sure not diet....\" I said Im sorry you drank out of my cup????? He said yes, I am so sorry ma'am I'll get you a new one. So I said okay and made a choice to go speak with the manager. Long story short the manager brushed me off and told me well he gave you a new drink and cup what else do you want? Lets just say I won't be eating at this location EVER again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place where the people are always very friendly, the food has always been good and prices are very reasonable. 
I enjoy the different options o choosing between which protein you want, with which sauce and side. Rapidly becoming one of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"I like most of the food here but I've had good service from some and then dismissive service/attitudes from other servers. They would have gotten four stars because I think their food is the best overall Chinese food in Lake Norman area but some of their servers can be rude/dismissive/abrupt. I may just stick to take out from them which is unfortunate because some of their dishes are best eaten right away."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised to have found our new favorite Asian restaurant. The food is just delicious. I ordered General chicken, which was perfectly crispy white meat chicken in a tangy sauce. The vegetables were also crisp and fresh. My husband ordered the best combo fried rice we have ever had. It was packed with flavor. This is our new go-to for delicious Asian food. 

Tip: The restaurant offers combination plates at lunch time, so if you want to check out the menu at a lower price than dinner time, you can at lunch and they also include soup and an egg roll. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the House of Taipei for years, especially when it was located in the University area as well. Their food is consistently delicious and the service is always excellent. I have probably tried 60 percent of the dishes offered and they are all terrific. The garlic scallops, however, are a bit overcooked but very well-seasoned. The prices are also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I have been in the area for about three years and I have tried just about every Chinese restaurant around (I admit it...I'm addicted to Chinese food!), but it wasn't until I found House of Taipei that I finally found what I'd been looking for. Until three years ago I had my favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant in New York and none here came close until this one...in fact House of Taipei may be some of the best moderately priced Chinese food I've had. Try the Sa Cha Chicken and you will not be disappointed! Also the patrons are very friendly. This place is going to be the bane of my waistline because I go so much now."}
{"text":"Average Chinese food here. Dinner prices seemed a bit steep but they do have large portions. I haven't found much Chinese food that I love in the area but so far this is one of the best."}
{"text":"We asked for fresh tea cups because there was dried food stuck to the insides. Gross. Our waiter picked them us, looked at us and said, okay, whatever you say. Rude. He brings back cups and puts them in my girlfriends face for \"inspection\".  This was the rudest thing I have waver heard from a waiter and the most arrogant, stupid thing you could say and do to a customer. Ever. We immediately said we are leaving and told the floor manager on the way out. He needs to find another job. We won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! We've been eating here for almost two years and it's always good. You can call in or order online and the food is ready in like 10 minutes, which is awesome if you ask me."}
{"text":"This place has such delicious food!  Their garlic sauce you can add to any dish is out of this world.  They have a great lunch menu, you get a full plate of food with an egg roll for $6.  You want a quick lunch but that will fill you up.... this is the place to go! YUM"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Huntersville, NC, to a restaurant recommended by a close friend, House of Taipei.

This restaurant serves authentic style Chinese dishes, some labeled Favorable, Traditional, Unforgettable and Vegetarian. Dora here. We saw several people toting take-out containers on the way in, so it appears they may be just as popular with take-out as eat-in. Although we've heard that sometimes there's a wait, on this particular Sunday evening, we were seated immediately. 

For my dinner, I chose the Pepper Steak. It's a challenge for me to order at Asian restaurants fearing I will order something that has more heat than I can take. (Dora here. No worries. They offer a ramp-it-up or dial-it-down option.  ) The sliced tenderloin is sautéed with green bell peppers and onions in a brown sauce. The steak was tender and the veggies had just the right amount of bite, and the sauce would have been great on any dish. Full of favor, I would definitely order this dish again.

Dora here. The Flower Chicken intrigued me. Slices of chicken, water chestnuts (I love that crunch, don't you?), red peppers, broccoli and mushrooms sauteed in a light, not-sure-if-its-really-there sauce. I'm not into heavy sauces so that was perfect for me. Delicate and light, colorful and pretty, the name of the dish really fits. And the best part? For just over $10, I had enough leftover chicken for another meal. Score!

Your turn: What's your favorite Chinese dish? We'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Meat prep is good, but for a place calling itself house of Taipei, I was expecting at least some Taiwanese specialties. This place has nothing but americanized Chinese food. It's unique in that you can pick different sauces so that is a redeeming factor. The egg rolls are good and not greasy. The fried rice is BRUTAL. It's soy sauce mixed with white rice and MaYBE warmed in a wok. Good for a cheap lunch when you just want some filler."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the Mu shu pork and spring roll tonight. Ning  Sun is an excellent waiter. Total bill without tip was $14.00 but I couldn't eat another bite. You can always get the same portion at lunch for less. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice sit-down Chinese restaurant.  The food is delicious & very flavorful.  I normally get the chicken and broccoli which is awesome!"}
{"text":"They're open from 11:30-3pm for lunch.. I knew it must be a great spot bc there were cars sitting in the lot. We pulled in at 11:20 not knowing they opened up at 11:30. They were fast about seating you & taking your order. We sat down at 11:30, had our food at 11:45, and was done eating and walking out the door before 12:00 pm."}
{"text":"Not sure if there has been a change of ownership, or what has happened, but things went downhill fast. Tonight's order will definitely be our last. The fried rice tasted like lukewarm oil, our eggroll's were definitely not the right color on the inside, and our container holding our chicken dish was only half full and incredibly bland. Essentially, the meal was only worth of a trash can, which is where it went. And I really, truly hate to waste food, so that is saying a lot.

We arrived at the restaurant to pick up our order exactly 3 minutes after I called it in, and it was already waiting for us on the counter. I should have known then what to expect!"}
{"text":"House of Taipei is Excellent!

We frequent the restaurant for lunch.  The food is always fresh.  Service is always quick.  The price can not be beat."}
{"text":"I had the hankering for asian food the other day. Since this place was so close to my house I figured I might as well try it. Walking in, it had a cozy/comfortable atmosphere. Nice big tables, and quiet environment. The service was great, and our drinks came right away. 

The menu was a little bland, not much option for vegetarians. However; they still have a small veggie menu which I appreciate. We started out with fried dumplings. Then had fried rice and the garlic brocoli. Everything was okay. The dumplings had great flavor, but the pastry was very thick and chewy, the rice was basic, and the brocoli was a little undercooked. Their sauces were great though. The dipping sauce for the dumplings was amazing, and I found myself spreading the garlic sauce over everything on my plate. 

Overall, I would say this place is pretty average. It's very safe: nothing outside of the box, but decent food nonetheless. 

I will say though, that their prices are WONDERFUL! Our whole meal was only  $15!!! So, for that price it is a fantastic place to go if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"Wish I could give higher rating based on the customer service which was exceptional, but the food was just ok. The teriyaki sauce was brown water, too thin & watery, no flavor, and the other chicken dish wasn't crispy, no texture like eating mush. Beautiful veggies though. I just hate it when food looks pretty and has little flavor. Maybe there was something I didn't know about how to order? Disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food the waiters are so nice and the dish we always get is the chicken and beef love main which are killer dishes as well as the sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, wide and varied menu, efficient service with very low prices.  They host our senior citizens luncheons. This my Asian son's favorite area restaurants.  EXCELENT."}
{"text":"Have taken my wife here a few times for lunch because she works nearby. The food was always delicious and the service has always been good. They stay busy but always can get in and out pretty fast since we don't have a lot of time during her lunch break. I highly recommend this place. It's not a buffet but reasonably priced."}
{"text":"House of Taipei has become a \"family\" spot for me to eat in or grab take out. Staff is wonderful and always helpful whether it is opening the door for me or helping me find a new dish to try. So glad I live right down the road! 

My favorite dishes if you want a recommendation: chicken lo mein, egg rolls (YUM), chicken skewers and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Best Scallion chicken! Great service too. Our go to for chinese! My DH and I always share scallion chicken and a side of sautéed broccoli. He loves their spring rolls and I love the egg rolls."}
{"text":"Was ok - service was good- wonton soup eatable but little taste - ribs good quality but little taste- General Tao chicken - very good- will go back but will stick to entrees."}
{"text":"Found out what I have been missing

I've known about this restaurant for years and even though my bank is right down the street, for some reason I've never made it here despite all the great reviews from my friends. I guess, out of sight out of mind.

Had to work today (Saturday) and called my wife and suggested we go out for dinner. Did not take much convincing and looking over possible choices, I remember this one.

Found out I had been missing a very good Chinese Restaurant all these years, right under my nose.

Got there a few minutes after 5 and they already had the start of a good dinner crowd.  I'm schedules for hip surgery in a couple of weeks and am on crutches but as soon as the owner saw me, he rushed to the front door and held both sets open for me.  Very courteous and a nice gesture and the start of great customer service.

Had a choice of table of booth and I chose a booth.  Server was there within a minute with menus etc.

I ordered Hot Tea and as opposed to Green Tea, their hot tea was Oolong. My wife went with her favorite plum wine although that is more Japanese than Chinese. Both were served in record time.

Looking over the menu, I order Hot and  Sour Soup which was the only disappointment of the meal. I was neither Hot either in serving temperature or spiciness nor was there any contrasting sourness.  The more I think about it, the more I think they messed up and I had Egg Drop Soup instead. At that point, I was too tired to notice.

My wife had a Spring Roll which she really liked.

For my entree, I had a big challenge. So many of my favorites were on the menu that is was hard to choose.  Ended up with the Seafood Delight which was Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops with Chinese Vegetables.

Wife ordered Scallops and Walnuts in a similar presentation

Both of us loved our meal. Prepared perfectly, great presentation, portions were huge.  Menu items do not lean to the spicy side so good to the average taste.

Very pleasant setting with great service and food. Will definitely be back and I do recommend.

For travelers on I-77, it off Exit 25 on the west side behind BB&T.  With red lights, less than 5 minutes to find and worth the effort."}
{"text":"Best Chinese around by far!!! Portions are huge. Best general tso chicken I've ever had. Their beef with black bean sauce is amazing too! I'm from NY and this is the closest to the Chinese back home I can find! This is the only real sit down (non-buffet) Chinese restaurant around. The waiters are all nice and friendly and really take care of you. My only complaint (and it's really more of a request) is that they need to sell fried wantons. Those are my favorite and NO Chinese place around has them :("}
{"text":"Very good Chinese Food! The best I've found so far in the Huntersville/Cornelius area.  Very good service.  Chicken with General sauce was very tasty."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a coworker. She quoted this place as the best Chinese takeout since she's moved from California. So, my boyfriend and I gave it a try. It was delicious. Unlike any Chinese food, I've ever had. I ordered the Ginger chicken with fried rice- and was not disappointed. It is a little pricey or higher than your average Chinese takeout- but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Was just okay food bland.  Service was slow unless you were a party more than one.  Had to ask for order to be taken and a to go box."}
{"text":"It's the restaurant you need, not the restaurant you deserve. You start off by coming in. The wait for a table is short. It doesn't matter if you have a table of two or twenty, you'll never have to wait long for a seat. When you get to your table, you will find some of the best service in all of Charlotte. Your order is taken rather quickly and you get your food very fast. It's unbelievable how fast the food comes out. As quick as five minutes. And the food is good. I've never been dissatisfied and I come here weekly. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a sit-down Chinese restaurant.  I went for lunch and service was absolutely spot on.  The menu is extensive and can be a little confusing.  They have Fried Dishes, Favorable Dishes (still not sure exactly what that means, all dishes should be favorable), Traditional Dishes (which aren't traditional), and even Unforgettable Dishes (which is just really funny to me)  Anyways, it took me a few minutes to decipher the menu and I ended up choosing Hot and Sour Soup and Chicken with Cashews and Mushrooms.  The soup was good, not the best I've had but good.  The Chicken was unfortunately not white meat but I still ate it.  My meal and the fried rice were tasty.  My husband ordered Won Ton Soup and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  His chicken was breast and he really enjoyed it.  The Won Ton Soup had no flavor and came with only one won ton.  He said he wouldn't order that again.  I had a bite and agreed that it tasted like water with one won ton.  

I'll be back because most of the meal was delicious.  Service was outstanding and the prices were really reasonable."}
{"text":"Delicious food!   We have been trying to find a decent non-fast food Asian restaurant for a while now and I think we found a winner!   Generous portions to take home.  Excellent hot and sour soup, steamed dumplings, fried rice, chicken with Black bean sauce and General Tsos chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Had hot & sour soup and crispy beef from their lunch menu. It was delicious! Healthy portions, prices are extremely reasonable, fresh ingredients, very tasty and the staff was extremely attentive. Reminded me of Chinese food in NY/NJ. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After visiting a property, me and my partner came here to discuss details about a potential accusation from seller. We arrived at the restaurant and were able to get a table right away. I think it was around closing time so we were lucky enough to get a good and fast service. 

We ordered our beverages which came pretty quickly. We ordered our food right away so that we can start our business discussion. We were hoping that it would take them good time to make our food which would allow us enough time to talk. We were wrong, the food came fast enough just like our drinks. So we ended up continue to discussion while we were eating (I know) and after our meal. Our food came out just the way we ordered it, my order is always custom and it came out right the first time. 

Even though our we were done with our food, we seat down long after the meal at the table to finish our conversation. Nobody came to our table to tell us that it was time for us to leave. I realized it so, I made the conversation short and told the seller that let's pick this up after we get more details from him which we requested it. 

The manager thanked us for visiting with a smily face which was a good service :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place...I've never dined in but I always order take out! This is the only Chinese restaurant that I eat at in the Charlotte area (even though it's techically located in Huntersville) So that's saying a lot! The service is always fast and friendly each time!"}
{"text":"my wife and I ate her last night when we found out our usual Chinese joint was under construction. We were a little leary but everything was GREAT. The place was clean and classy. We had eggrols, crab rangoon, mongolian, beef and kan-bo chicken. THIS WAS THE BEST CHINESE I HAVE EVER EATEN. No kidding, the best. The crab rangoon had real crab and cream cheese. The chicken and beef were awesome. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here just once & was prompted to do so after being told what a fantastic restaurant it was.

Much to my disappointment I found my meal to be rather bland - not nearly spicy enough despite asking for some heat.  The person I ate with had been there before & said it was not as good as her previous experience.  It wasn't that it was bad, but it certainly wasn't anything special nor memorable.

Maybe I'll give it another try if I'm in the vicinity.  But being great one time, mediocre the next just doesn't make it.  Consistency is a must."}
{"text":"Food was great! Portions larger than we had anticipated. Had a party of 4 and could have eaten off of 2 dishes. Very happy and will be back!"}
{"text":"Typical American-Chinese fare. One item of novelty may be the sa-cha sauce. You can have it prepared with chicken, pork and etc. For the mildly adventourous eater, try the sa-cha.

Asides that, its the same old same old..."}
{"text":"Travel from Ohio to Florida and back each year, always stop in the area for the night to split the driving. Never eaten anywhere else in the area! Best food!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and food was good. I ordered take out chicken low main, it was ok, noodles a bit undercooked, the Mongolian beef was delicious, meat perfectly cooked! Last tu NF was stir-fry shrimp... every bite was great, only negative in this dish is that they add too much sugar to it... i actually bit a few chucks of sugar. Overall, not bad... better than most Chinese Food joints... ohhh, it did bother me that they don't give you any \"hot sauce\" with your order... even after coughing up $45 for take out, they wanted me to pay an additional 25 cents for hot sauce, really??? Still Gabe them 4 STARS."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple of times a month.  Really nice front of the house staff.  Seems to be family owned and oprerated.

Great price and good American Chinese Food.  (I dig the Chicken Kon-Bo).  They have a REALLY good soup for two that, if you're looking for something more healthy than MSG brown sauce, is a good option.

Bar-style waiting area.  Gets busy during lunch and dinner, especially on weekends.

BE CAREFUL about drinking and driving.  The Exit 25 area is regularly patrolled by law enforcement.  Better to get a cab."}
{"text":"I don't usually like Chinese food, and my husband and I visited this place on a whim.  While not as good as PF Chang's, they certainly are not bad.  The noodle dishes are often overcooked, however, and their steamed dumplings are just plain doughy.  

I wish they would offer delivery!"}
{"text":"We order out from this restaurant all the time because it's close to our house.  We constantly order new items and have always loved everything!!"}
{"text":"Many people love this place and keep telling hyping it up, so I keep going back because I think I must be missing something. 

I despise the former-New-Yorker-Superiority attitude, and I'm not like that; but being from NY could definitely be a factor here. I'm comparing House of Taipei to high-quality NY Chinese restaurants, not NC Chinese restaurants. 

Sesame Chicken with White Rice: Very good
Chicken Lo Mein: Winner
Shrimp: Good (not great)
Wonton Soup: A little bland (add soy sauce)
Teriyaki Chicken: Undercooked

Your expectations should be based on your past Chinese restaurant experiences."}
{"text":"Warning:  This review is going to bring out my inner Negative Nancy.  Please forgive me...I must be in a 'mood' today.

Let's start at the beginning, House of Taipei has been one of my most frequented restaurants in Huntersville for the last few years.  I eat there at least once a week and will continue to eat there (even after I write this review).  Overall, they are wonderful.  The food is consistently good with very quick service.  They are very generous with their wine pours (even though I'm a bit skeptical that you get the kind of wine you actually order- I am a wine lover and it always seems that every kind of wine at House of Taipei tastes the same).  

Now, for the negatives...
-I have a love for spicy food- no matter how many times I ask for \"extra spicy,\" the food is never, ever spicy!  Even when I order dishes (like Black Pepper Chicken) that are supposed to be spicy, it isn't and it makes me sad.  =(
-I saw a roach.  Ugh, gross, disgusting, etc etc etc!  Now, let's be honest, you'd be hard-pressed to find any kind of establishment that doesn't have at least one creepy-crawly.  Here's the problem- I DON'T WANT TO SEE A ROACH CRAWLING ON THE WALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WHILE I'M STUFFING MY FACE WITH CRISPY SCALLION CHICKEN!!!!  I quickly called the waitress over, she freaked out, called another waiter over, who proceeded to grab a napkin (a cloth one, mind you.... I may never use a napkin there again either), and SMASH the roach on the wall 3 feet in front of my head.  I couldn't finish my dinner and they weren't even embarrassed or apologetic.  Gross Gross Gross!!!


All roaches aside, I really do love House of Taipei and have every intention of going there again (but I need some time to forget about the critter).  

If you haven't tried it, you should.  Their prices are wonderful and you rarely have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Good food and ok price! 
Used to be a little better but not bad.
There is better near by bit it'll do in a crunch."}
{"text":"We live in Mooresville and we make the ever-so-treacherous drive to Huntersville (a whole whopping ~10 miles) when we want GOOD CHINESE. 

While it's not really that far, it's further than we typically go because Mooresville and Lake Norman have such fantastic dining options. Plus, on a weekday, around dinner time (with rush-hour traffic) it takes a solid 30+ minutes to get there. The other thing to note, is that anyone can get Chinese basically in at least one place within every two square miles of any mildly populated local. But, this is by far, our favorite!

It's surprisingly large and a bit hidden off exit 25 - behind Bob Evan's and BB&T on the left before you get to Birkdale. But, I believe they make a killing just by word of mouth - and Yelp of course. So I give it 5 stars for consistent quality, speed and flavor.

Now, what do I recommend...? Well, we love their scallion chicken (it's my husband's favorite, he gets it without the scallions/onions). It comes with white rice and is always served with a delicious crisp exterior and the perfect amount of sauce (if you eat it on site that is), and somehow the middle is still moist. The quality of the chicken is average, but it's always tasty. TIP: If you ever get this to go, order the sauce on the side! Night and day difference when you get it to go this way.

I love their Mu Shu chicken... I've always been a sucker for a good Mu Shu, and I find quality Mu Shu hard to find. Typically, theirs is not too oily (like some places) and they give you a decent quantity and mix of meat and chicken. Like most Chinese places that serve Mu Shu, they give you an oddly small amount of pancakes. I think they charge me 25 cents for each extra pancake, and I usually get 3-4 extra pancakes. Plus, I often ask for extra sauce (it's called hoisin sauce), especially if it's to go - they'll give you the tiniest little container otherwise.

For appetizers, I love their crab rangoon. Personally, I only like my crab rangoon with the bright red sweet & sour sauce. Here, they only give you duck sauce (made with duck of course! .... kidding!) So I always ask for the sauce, which they of course charge me at least $1 for.

In terms of price, it's not super expensive, but it's also not cheap. We usually leave having paid between $30-40 including tip. I am a stickler for discounts and bargains, but this place is so good, I have no qualms about going without a coupon (which I've never seen for this place, and trust me, I've looked.)

Net, this place has really excellent Chinese. They 'nickel & dime' you for the little things, but I keep going back which says a lot. ...especially if you know me. 

Give it a try; you will not be disappointed.

Note to management, PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN MOORESVILLE!!!! (That would be amazing!)"}
{"text":"We chose this place based off of the reviews, and of all the good places to get Chinese food, I was wildly disappointed. The cost per taste was

To start: the egg roll was horrible: something I could get from a college Chinese place in Florida where the whole meal is $5. There was a lack of cabbage and the wrapping was undercooked on the inside, overlooked on the outside, and quite frankly I could probably get better at Costco in the frozen department.

Then the wonton egg drop soup... with one small wanton. The soup itself severely lacked flavor as did the wonton. The noodle part was so bland, soy sauce couldn't help it. The meat inside was equally bland and left much to be desired."}
{"text":"We just move here from Connecticut and thought so far this is the best Chinese we have had thus far. Mannn are they fast though so don't let them rush you. I was surprised they charge you for a second pot of tea, but what ever. We had a decent meal. The hot and sour soup was not he nest I ever had but it was good"}
{"text":"Always consistent American style Chinese food. Though for American style it is very flavorful with lots of use of garlic, hot peppers and ginger. Great dishes like eggplant and chicken with garlic sauce. And greens beans and chicken with ginger. Hot and sour soup could be more hot and more sour. Service is always good and they of course have takeout."}
{"text":"We have been getting take out from here as well.as dining in for years. The food is always great but we finally had enough of the waiters having terrible attitudes last Friday. I asked for no mushrooms in what I ordered and he shook his head, rolled his eyes and laughed at me saying there were none in egg rolls. When my husband said something to the manager and woman at the counter they couldn't have cared less. We ended up leaving. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been going here with my family for as long as I can remember. The family who owns the place is always friendly and helpful and the food is the best Chinese food I've ever had. I choose to go here every year on my birthday. The dumplings (especially the sauce) is my absolute favorite and and we often order extras to go. Egg rolls and won ton soup is great, and my favorite entrees are ginger chicken and pork fried rice."}
{"text":"Been pleased ever since we moved here 9 years ago that there was a Chinese place of House of Taipei's caliber so close to home. Have only gotten one thing during that entire time that I would consider not so hot. The teriyaki steak. That makes about a 98% hit rate though on a hell of a lot of at bats so, not too shabby. 

Funny to me that in all this time we have never had a meal IN the restaurant!  Take-out all the way and have never been told anything other than, ready in 10 minutes. Oh yeah, and the order is always right when I get home!"}
