{"text":"Food was Great. I order Lamb CousCous and my friend ordered Duck. It was rally good. Well cooked and delicious. The waiter was awesome. so friendly and kind"}
{"text":"My salad had rotten lettuce in it-- not just wilted , ROTTEN!!!  I told the manager, he still charged me for it.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  I can think of 5 places there on Coventry with better food for less money."}
{"text":"I am not great at doing restaurant reviews so the other 5-star reviewers can speak for me. However, I must say the meals that my friend and I had were fabulous. I had the Mediterranean Seafood dish. It was soooo good. The lobster, scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly. The sauce was to die for. The portions were huge.It is a lovely room and everyone was very nice. I felt I go my money's worth and more."}
{"text":"I had the salmon pizza, and that was some NASTY A&& $H!T!!!!!!!! I've had way better FROZEN salmon pizza from Trader Joe's, so yeah. And once again the wait staff totally sucked. This is my definite last time going to Bohaters, I'm sorry I mean Bodega's."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the ambiance. The calamari with sesame seeds and the raw tuna with avocado were good. Although the tuna dressing may be a little too sweet for my taste. It's a great place for a date and a classier choice to hang with some friends! Chic with comfortable couches.  Service is good also."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food, great service and atmosphere. Very accommodating to our 2 year old, even she had a great time"}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience. I went for dinner on a Monday evening. The waitress was personable and attentive, the food was fantastic (both in portion and in price), and the atmosphere is very modest and comfortable. Great place to entertain out-of-town guests, or grab drinks after work. I love this place"}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall kind of places - great food, no service, no pretense.  So why 4 *s for this dimly lit, yuppish, basement bar with an overdone chandelier?  HALF-PRICE TAPAS on Tuesday nights.  The tapas are not traditional but nonetheless tasty.  There are several seafood options, and the menu changes from time to time.  The place makes itself to be fancy, but I like going with friends to stuff our faces with tapas.  Since the food is half-price, it's the only tapas place where I can leave full.  If you go early enough, you can enjoy those cheap eats with a $2 Brooklyn Lager.  Go to Bodega for expensive frou frou drinks some other time.  Tuesday nights are right for tapas."}
{"text":"My husband and I randomly chose this place, because it was after 10 and we were hungry.  That's sometimes hard to satisfy on Coventry, so I'm really glad we found Bodega.  We were overwhelmed with their drink menu, which is a great problem to have.  My husband wasn't wowed by the Ommegang Hennepin, but it tasted decent enough.   We were, however, wowed by the tapas.    We ordered the caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes, calamari with spicy alioli, hummus and quail stuffed with prosciutto and gruyere.  Oh my, my my.   The tomatoes were delicious and the mozzarella melted in our mouths.  The calamari was perfectly crispy and had a good kick to it.  Hummus was yummus!  Now the quail was something to behold.  We came from two big restaurant cities - SF and Chicago and we thought we'd take a chance to try something that has amazing potential for goodness.  But we were still a bit worried.  But thank god we ordered it. SO tasty and melty.  The quail sat on a bed of spicy corn that could have been a dish in and of itself.    Good, attentive service and if it hadn't been late, we might have hung out longer.   A really good experience and I would definitely come back.  Maybe during that happy hour when everything is 50%!"}
{"text":"I have been reading some very poor reviews so I decided to write one myself. We were there on a Thursday night which is 1/2 price wine by the bottle night. This brought the bottle price to just about retail. They have a nice wine selection and I picked out a Portuguese wine.  The food is very good. We had the tuna tartar, roasted mussels, seafood paella, short ribs, and the lamb couscous.  The portions were huge. In fact they was so much food that everybody took home half of their dinners. Yes, most of the dinners come with mashed potatoes and asparagus but so what the sides are tasty. We all came away very impressed and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I used to live in Cleveland and was back for a visit so decided to try somewhere new.  Overall it was a good experience.  The tapas was solid to excellent and the drinks were creative.  The service was attentive but not overbearing, although our server seemed a little inexperienced.  We never had an empty glass on our table.  Bodega just seems a little out of place in Coventry, with its college bars and pub grub.      There was a huge martini list for about $10 each with a range of interesting concoctions categorized by dominant flavor (berry, citrus, etc).    The tapas was good, but felt a little overpriced.  We ordered 5 dishes for our group of three for a light dinner.  The standout dishes were the stuffed quail that melted off the bone and an eggplant thing that was rolled up, stuffed with cheese and fried served with a spicy tomato sauce that was awesome.  There was also a lounge area toward the back of the restaurant with couches that looked like a fun place to sit and have cocktails."}
{"text":"I tried the stuffed salmon with lobster, shrimp, and crab. It came with garlic mash and asparagus as well. Great dish from start to finish. Everything was on point. Also I had a few Moscow mules that evening to mix up the night. Bodega is a very chill but good place to enjoy good food and spirits."}
{"text":"One word: TAPAS.  If you're looking for some small plates to share (or keep for yourself - hey, I understand) then you most certainly need to check out Bodega.    You will be completely surprised when you enter this restaurant - you will totally feel like you just walked into a hot spot in the middle of Manhattan.  The decor is very contemporary, crisp, and beautiful and the vibe is very downtown trendy.  You'll be instantly sucked in.  I've usually sit at the bar - quick service and easy access to the drinks ;)  I would suggest trying a martini or a mojito - both are excellent.  I've only eaten the tapas here, mainly because they are that good I can't get past them on the menu - my desire stops here.  My favorites: the lobster mac & cheese, tuna tartar with mango and avocado, and the lobster nachos.  The hummus plate is also really great!  As for the rest of the menu, beware that the entrees are quite pricey (whmm..maybe that's why I've never ordered one??), but they look delicious and I'm sure they are.    All in all, you'll have a great meal and the experience of dining in NYC (except you'll really be in the CLE)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. So-so food. Pom frites too salty to eat, lamb chops ordered med rare were well done, oysters small and many pieces of shell in them. Quail special was really good.  The kitchen needs work especially as it was not even a busy night"}
{"text":"I want everyone to know about this restaurant because it's just that good!    There's a decent wine list...any varietal that you're into will probably be offered there.   The quail alone is worth the trip. I think it's the best item on the menu. My companion and I ordered it, split a wedge salad. He got the ravioli with tiger shrimp (amazing) and I got the Mediterranean seafood (very good). The food is artful, delectable and there seem to be a few ways to bust the bill. We used a coupon from restaurant.com which was spend $50, redeem $50. So the price was reasonable.  If you've got room, give the bread pudding a try. But the real showstopper is the coffee. It tastes like a blend sold in Chicago; Papa Nicholas. It's wonderful and a nice way to end the meal.  The food gets a 5, definitely.  The only thing preventing me from giving this a perfect 5 is the service. I've been to Bodega twice. The service has been friendly both times but the servers do not seem experienced or sharp. They miss details and in a place like Bodega, the success or failure of the place will rest on getting the details correct. The other Yelpers seem to be agreeing with me.   So the critique simply is this: the servers need trained on the details. When you present the wine and decant it, pour a glass for each. When you approach the table and the wine glasses are empty, fill them. The devil's in the details but that's where this place will go from good to a must-do!"}
{"text":"Bodega is beautiful inside.  I especially love the chandelier!     The tapas however are mediocre ....  The lobster bisque was the consistency of paste.  Don't do it.  The ceviche, which was the winner of the evening, while not traditional, was quite good.  The mussels were overdone, but ok.    The service was not what you would expect - unbelievably we were served a basket of half eaten bread and they were out of several items on the menu we wanted to order ..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I don't know why more people don't know about this place?! The tapas are all awesome, especially the pomme frites!! It is true moroccan food mixed with other styles of food. I've been here the last 3 weekends!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever stepped foot in. When we walked in the maitre d ask if we had reservations.... There was one other table seated and no one else in the restaurant. The plates had black tar all over them and there was one server for the whole restaurant. I would expect more out of a place that charges $20-$40 an entree. Service was monumentally slow and the  menu's clearly hadn't been updated in quiet some time as they had wine stains and other unknown stains all over them. We left after waiting 20 minutes for our wine and our server that disappeared once we placed our order."}
{"text":"This facility has a really nice decor. The inside is small, I wouldn't say it's intimate so keep that in mind if you are considering this place a date. I did not order food, just drinks. I liked the music. If you spend lots of money, they will love you."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for my pre-birthday celebration and I must say, \"I made the right choice!\" I made reservations for six (6) and was running late. I called ahead and was quickly accommodated upon arrival. My family and I were seated at a center table and the manager/owner greeted us and was nice enough to wish me a \"happy birthday.\" Our server(s) greeted us immediately and recommended a drink, the pear martini (I think) & it was delicious! All at once, we had three (3) servers and they in turn, took our drink and dinner orders. Fast forward to dinner, I ordered the seafood ceviche as an appetizer prior to the main entree, stuffed chicken Florentine with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. Everything I must say, was \"Delicious!\" Compliments to the chef! My family was also very satisfied with their appetizers and dinner as well (unfortunately, I don't remember what they ordered, sorry). Needless to say, \"Kudos! Bodega rocks!\" Hurry up & get there! You won't be disappointed. Enjoy! I'll be returning, for a more intimate dinner and am looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I got the lamb dish, it really yummy, but a little crazy that it didn't come with any carbs or vegetables. It was literally only lamb, which was overwhelming"}
{"text":"Omg.. the food was terrible! I did not expect that at all. We ordered a couple of dishes from the tapas menu. The waitress brought us what she suggested that we should order instead of what we ordered. The lobster nachos was okay but we didn't like the calamari or the quail. Entrees came in very small portions. We ordered what was supposed to be a seafood dish but turned out to be vegetarian fried rice!?! I don't think I would eat here again (not even during the happy hour)."}
{"text":"Needed late night food. Hummus was good, liver was good but the flat bread sucked. Overall I guess I would come back, kind of a hip vibe which isn't my thing though. Lots of white t-shirts at the bar- take that how you need to"}
{"text":"Went here to see my dad's band play. The atmosphere was really nice... A bit dark. The lighting and decor is very modern and pretty cool. We walked in to sit at the bar and were immediately approached by someone asking where we were going... It was pretty rude. When we said we were headed to the bar he just walked away. We ordered calamari and the prosciutto flat bread. Both were very tasty and well presented. The bartender was a little unfriendly and seemed to careless that we were there. No one asked how our food was or if we wanted another drink. The check was just brought to us.  All in all... The service was pretty bad. Actually didn't meet anyone that worked there who seemed friendly. I watched a server near us clearly roll her eyes at a couple that was having a hard time deciding what to order... BUT  the food was good! I would probably go back just to eat... But I won't expect anything good from the staff."}
{"text":"Widely divergent Yelp reviews gave me pause about going to Bodega, but happily our experience came out on the very positive end of the continuum. Ambience was pleasant and service was competent, but what really stood out was quality and quantity of the food.  My meal was two tapas: quail stuffed with prosciutto ham and gruyere cheese, over a bed of truffled cream corn -- delicious! -- and Truffled Pommes Frites (excellent French fries). My partner had lamb mrouzia (generous serving of lamb shank braised with caramelized onions, prunes, roasted almonds, cinnamon and sesame seeds). She asked for extra spice and that's how it was prepared -- just right. Don't remember the other two entrees at the table (a pasta dish and possibly couscous), but both got high compliments and everyone had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and would suggest a great place for a date however, when I went (the whole 2 hours) no one else showed up to eat. I was baffled that my guest and I were the only ones eating in the restaurant.   I started out my order with the hummus which I found to be delicious but nothing about it stood out from other restaurants. I ordered the kabobs for my entree and while the meat was cooked correctly the couscous was underwhelming for being Moroccan cuisine."}
{"text":"Bodega is my most recent surprising discovery. I'm sure I've walked by this place hundreds of times and never thought anything of it. But now that I know what lurks behind that modest neon in the window of the storefront that holds Phoenix, Coventry has changed for me.   The drinks are simply ok. I'd say the highlight of this place is definitely the food, because the drinks could use some improvement, though I found that sticking with a dirty martini is a safe bet. That said, the happy hour is a great deal! I've had the ceviche, lobster nachos and calamari. The calamari was ok (with a few sauces that really had me intrigued and excited), but the ceviche and lobster nachos were fantastic! Those nachos were surprising and GREAT. I'm also not huge on lamb, but the lamb lollipops were SO GOOD. I'd definitely come back just for those babies. The limoncello mousse cake is a perfect ending to a delicious meal and drinks, too. I wouldn't come here starving, because the portions are a bit dainty, but if you're here for 1/2 off tapas on Tuesday, it's well worth it to get an assortment of things. Though things are dainty, don't be fooled; the amount of flavor packing into these things is huge.   The service here is actually some of the best I've ever had. They always greet you very nicely at the door and the servers are the friendliest. They help when you're indecisive, which is super for me, and aren't put off by indecisiveness even after some great help.   This place is really a great little hidden gem and the patio is beautiful; you'll probably forget that you're in Coventry."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place near Coventry for a colleague's birthday party. Bodega has tapas Tuesday and happy hour, which worked out for us. All of my friends at work have never been here before so it was a pleasant surprise and I got all the praise for picking the place.   The interior is quite nice. Adequate lighting and ample space for friends to hangout. we were a big party but well accommodated. My friends enjoyed their happy hour martini es and beers. I had their vegetarian couscous. It was nice. All of my friends enjoyed their food a lot. Wait staff was nice and attentive.   It is a nice place to hangout with friends after work and also for a nice date on the weekends."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place higher!! The decor was great and the menu is awesome - something for everyone.  Our food was definitely 5 star material, but our service was terrible. I feel bad even saying that because our server was running his butt off and he was trying to hard, but he simply had too many tables. We could see 4 tables he had, plus us, and he informed us they had given him a table of 25! WTF? It took about 2 hours to have dinner and pay and we were seated right away.  The hostess was great - she was running around trying to help everyone too, but unfortunately they lost some business because of this. A few couples walked in and left because there was no one to greet them and after waiting a few minutes they must have grown impatient.  I will def give this place another shot, the food was amazing, I think the main issues here are bad management and short staffed."}
{"text":"I asked the waiter 4 times for bread and was told first he forgot then the kitchen hasn't baked anymore after he asked three times... not very happy at all with my service . I came with a total party of 14... very disappointed first time last time"}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday.  We enjoyed the real moroccan food. The seafood stew called berber Sew was out of sight!  The Quail app was the wife's fav!  We will be back for our next special occasion."}
{"text":"Came out for date night with my wife and initially impressed with the decor and ambiance of the place. The food is only mediocre, we had the calamari appetizer and it was obviously not fresh made but frozen. My wife had the Pan seared duck and it was very good but I had the Seafood pasta and it was only so-so. The past was both over and under cooked and the seafood was rubbery. I would probably give thia place a second chance just on the ambiance."}
{"text":"Bodega is the new tapas place on Coventry in the former Utrecht space. The space itself is absolutely beautiful with Spanish tile, slate water wall, beautiful chandelier, unique wine wall, & spotless bathrooms. It's very fancy!   I wish that the food lived up to the decor. I was immediately disappointed that the menu was not traditional Spanish style tapas. But that would have been OK if the food was good enough. We had the heirloom caprese salad, tuna tempura roll, monkfish something or other. The only remarkable tapas was the caprese. We had the banana bread pudding for dessert and it was absolutely delicious, but did not really make up for what was lacking in the tapas.   The service needs polishing -- we had to ask for bread (all of the other tables had it); and the server really couldn't describe anything on the menu. But she was very sweet, probably just inexperienced.  Granted we did not try that many things on the menu, it is possible that I will go back to try out more of the food. The website states that Tuesdays is 50% off all tapas from 4-9pm, so that might be a good opportunity.   They have a ridiculous drink menu (12 pages of martinis), so if you are in the mood for drinks & dessert, maybe this is the place.   PS -- The menu on their website is definitely NOT the menu that we were offered. Which is fine, but just note that if you are expecting to do some research in advance."}
{"text":"Bodega has a great atmosphere and ambiance, but I was surprised to see on a Friday night that this place was empty.  Maybe a total of 15 people there....service was pretty good at the bar.  Food: Had the Lobster Mac N Cheese, was delicious.  Wish they would of put smaller pieces of lobster in it, only thing I didn't like about it.    Drink: Went with the fancy pants, was vodka, pink lemonade, and champagne mixed together, was pretty good.  Overall:  I thought it was a great place to go with a group of people or a nice date for two.  Will 100% go back to Bodega, they did impress me."}
{"text":"I found this place blind, with the aid of Yelp. I was wandering Coventry to see what's changed since i was here as a kid, and I had some time reserved for a decent dinner-for-one at the bar after a 5-hour plane ride.  The bartender was very kind to offer me a taste of the wine before I got a full glass. Unfortunately, the glass smelled like bubble gum and had lip prints all over it because it hadn't been properly washed. Too bad he didn't check before he poured, as most bartenders would. He promptly re-poured, and the wine was fine.  I've lived on both coasts and worked in restaurants during college, so I know enough to stay away from seafood in the Midwest. I try to order seasonally and locally. Today is June 25. It is most definitely tomato season and I'm in a city where I expect people can appreciate heirlooms, so I ordered the caprese salad.  It was composed of thick slabs of hard, flavorless SYSCO tomato ice-cold from the fridge, interlaced with just-ok fresh mozzarella. I even checked the plate for condensation to see if it had been pre-assembled and pulled from the cooler (I don't think it had). This burger-sized stack was topped with Italian salad dressing. From a bottle. This is just wrong. And scattered with some arugula, which they mistakenly call \"micro-greens\".  A caprese salad is, in my opinion, pretty hard to screw up. It's just a few good ingredients, sliced and put on a plate with some oil, totally un-fussy. But this assemblage was so bad, I did not finish it.  There's no excuse for this. You can't charge $8 for this pile. I don't want to pay for the two guys behind the bar to shoot the shit instead of serving the three of us who are seated there.  Once i got the barkeep's attention I tried to cancel my second-course order so i could leave, but it had already been fired. In fact, when I asked about canceling it was sitting in the window, getting cold.  The foie gras was okay, but was basically overpowered by the risotto on which it had been parked. There was a green oil on the plate which could only be appreciated visually.  If you're going to put up this kind of a facade with the decor, you cannot fall this short on food. I'd suggest that they skip the pretense of being a restaurant and focus on drinks and music, which the other reviewers seem to appreciate. It is a good space for a bar/club vibe, so unless their liquor license is dependent on having a menu they should toss it in the trash. Or, fire the chef and start from scratch.  Luckily I also bought a half sandwich from Grums, thinking this was just a bit of cheap comfort food to eat on a long car ride the next day. Too bad it had to stand in for my dinner."}
{"text":"Not a good experience!!! Expensive for the quality of food..... I won't come to this place again"}
{"text":"So I ventured into this establishment with some doubts. To put it lightly I was very surprised by the size and intimacy of this tapas bar. If you go early in evening like 5:30pm to eat you will have plenty of time to enjoy some drinks and night life. The food was excellent, there is a lot to choose from I personally loved the Mediterranean themed menu and it is fairly affordable hence the four stars."}
{"text":"Extensive menu with a lot of options and all of them are amazing. The price point is high, but the portions are large (even tapas and plates) so it's definitely worth it. It is very unique high quality food. The vibe is laid back fine dining with a full bar. Their Moroccan food is exceptional, all seafood dishes are to die for, and they make some dope martinis. I love this place, there's nowhere like it."}
{"text":"Great decor, good food.  It's somewhat hidden in the barrage of restaurants and shops on Coventry.  Once you step down the stairs, the atmosphere is breath-taking and nicely done (I'M A HUGE FAN OF MODERN DECOR).  The service was relatively attentive, but the waiter took a while to take our order.  The waiter also boxed only half of my leftovers.  I went during half price tapas which was good.  I would only go during half price tapas- it's too overpriced for the quality/taste of food during normal dinners.  I sampled almost every tapas plate: foie gras, kobe beef burger sliders, calamari, truffle oil fries, mussels, tuna tar tar.  If you decide to get tapas, skip the kobe beer burger (waste of perfectly good kobe beef- overdone and dry masked with a spicy mayo to mask it). The calamari was relatively good- a little salty and nothing special (same dish different restaurant).  The mussels sat in a curry like broth (however the broth lacked any real kick or standout flavoring).  The foie gras is good, but very heavy which is expected for liver.  The fries are good, but not great.  Tuna tar tar wasn't too bad either, but nothing special.  Overall, the food is somewhat good, but nothing exceptional.  I like the atmosphere over the food, overall you aren't missing much if you don't go."}
{"text":"I was shocked to stumble by Bodega on my trip back to Cleveland. who knew the eclectic little coventry neighborhood would ever be home to a trendy restaurant/lounge?    I was intrigued by this anomaly, so we went for drinks.  the place is gorgeous, the service is great, and they even had a DJ that night.  If I was still at Case, I'd probably be back more often."}
{"text":"Our second time at Bodega. Just as delicious as the first time. Sat on the patio. Don't recommend it since we kept catching whiffs of a dumpster. Food was excellent though!"}
{"text":"I went to Bodega with some friends for dinner this week, but first time dining here in 8 years. I didn't particularly care for it the first time around, but thought maybe after several years, things would have changed. I was sorely wrong. The service at the restaurant was absolutely appalling. The waitress was rude right out of the gate, setting the tone for the evening. It took 45 minutes for us to receive our food (one order was mac and cheese, another was soup) and when I asked the manager about the wait time, he looked at me like I had 5 horns coming out of his head. His response \"Morrocan food takes time to cook.\" Minutes later, the waitress hands me a slip of paper and said \"My manager wanted you to see what time the order was put in.\" As if to prove me wrong, that it was indeed, not a 45 minute wait, but pretty damn close. I was shocked. No apologies, no real explanation. The restaurant was not crowded and some people seated after us, were served before us. I would seriously think twice about dining here. The experience was one of the worst I've ever had. I have no idea how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food. Mixed grill main course is big enough for 2 to share and meet was cooked perfectly. Had 2 appetizers - foie gras and lobster nachos, both were ok, nothing extra special. Limited dessert menu so my wife and I went somewhere else for dessert"}
{"text":"Bodega is pretty darn awesome :) I love coming here Tuesdays for half off tapas! They also have a great variety of $5 martinis on Mondays! Here are some items I've tried:   - Truffled pomme frites: WOW OH WOW I just simply love the texture of the fries paired with the rich truffle flavor! Seriously my favorite appetizer here.  - Calamari: Very crispy and savory :) I definitely recommend this!  - House made hummus: this tasted like your average store-bought hummus, but it did come with some olives and stuffed grape leaves.  - Vegetarian couscous: this was kind of gross :( My couscous was a bit too watery.   Overall, I've enjoyed my dining experiences at Bodega. They have some of the nicest servers around as well. Definitely recommend checking it out, especially during happy hours!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my boyfriend and his parents last night. First, our server was Peter, who is only a month old employee but was very enjoyable. He had great conversation with us and you can tell he cares about this job. Coming from a fellow service industry peep, that attitude can be hard to maintain. Although his knowledge of the, largely extensive, menu wasn't a hundred percent, he tried to give suggestions and ended up nailing it on the head with our meals. Also, the lead bartender came out to serve us our bottle of wine and she was very knowledgeable and pleasant to talk to as well. The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because it seemed as if our meals' timing was just slightly off - a couple of us got our plates first and the others were waiting. Also, mine and my boyfriend's food was a little cold.  Overall, the experience and atmosphere was great and we had a wonderful time. We'll see you next time, Bodega!"}
{"text":"I went to Bodega with my boyfriend for a little date night. I had a Groupon for this place and was excited to give it a try. We got there late in the evening on a Wednesday night, after the dinner rush, so it wasn't especially busy. Nonetheless there was no server in sight and we waited at the hostess' desk for 5 minutes before someone came to seat us. After being seated, we ordered drinks (a little disappointed that their drink specials don't apply if you have a Groupon, but I guess I can only get so many deals. No ladies' night for me). Our server disappeared and never reemerged. After waiting for 30 minutes and not even receiving our drinks, completely unable to flag down any employee, we left in a huff. It was absolutely absurd and disgraceful, especially for such an upscale restaurant. Even Denny's has better service than this place - and from seeing people at tables around me frustrated about the lack of service, having to go into the back of the restaurant to find someone to give their check to, it seems like my experience wasn't unique. I called a couple days later to complain; I asked to speak to a manager, but they said the manager wasn't it (apparently nobody works there). I left my name and phone number and was told I'd get a call back the next day, but naturally I never got a call back. Instead I contacted Groupon and got a refund for my voucher. It's not worth wasting any more of my time at this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"WOOOOOW!!!! This food was amazing!! It was very authentic, very comfortable, had live music, and a very comfortable patio area. The waitress was training another server, and they were both awesome ladies!! My husband and I enjoyed the Lamb Lollipops, Crab Croquettes, and the Mussels w/ the Fennel. THESE WERE THE BEST MUSSELS WE HAVE EVER HAD!! and we dine all over the country!!! For dinner we shared the \"Fez Chicken\" which our server recommended. I did not think I would like this dish b/c it said it had cinnamon, but my God was it good!! I was so grateful that our server suggested this authentic Moroccan dish. WE WILL BE REGULARS!! YOU MUST TRY!! They also have really great happy hour prices, and weekly specials!"}
{"text":"The staff acted like they had never served a party of 6 before. At the encouragement of our waiter 3 in our party ordered the rack of lamb special. 15 minutes later we were advised they were out of the rack of lamb. The entrees didn't show up together.  15 minute spread. We waited another 15 minutes for a bottle of wine to arrive which was after we finished our entrees. Great decor and ambiance very good food and a friendly and inept staff.  My favorite line of the night came when I asked if they had espresso and our waiter replied \" Yeah right,  that would be a stretch.\" So would my coming back here. This is Cleveland, Bodega . If you charge top dollar you'd better deliver consistently.  Thankfully we have so many other options."}
{"text":"Expensive and sub-par food. The service was very novice. Things like making us eat on a wobbly table with wine glasses and then putting a napkin under the base instead of moving us? Or when we asked for ketchup for our fries, we were brought approx 2 teaspoons and had to request more.   I can usually overlook service (unless it was rude or something) if the food or ambiance made up for it. The food was ordinary, sometimes a bit over greased ( perhaps to make up in lack of flavor). The ambiance was average. Worst was the price. Anyways, off to the next spot!"}
{"text":"Went to this awesome place last night. The ambiance is everything and everyone was so accommodating! I live in Columbus Ohio and wanted \"real food\" after watching coming to town for a Cavs game, GO LEBRON!!!, anyway this place serves the full menu late night until close which is 2am which was amazing! Definitely plan to come back, I would have given it 5 stars but the Lamb Lollipop dish I got wasn't that great but The Mix dish was everything! Lamb, beef and chicken spiced and cooked to perfection. Definitely worth a shot!!"}
{"text":"Seafood? More like NERF balls.  On first glance Bodega looks great. The decor is a little trendy (I'd hate to say it but almost exactly the same as Lolita). You walk in through a coffee shoppe door and down some stairs. If Bodega were quiet (which I will comment on later) you'd be sure to hear the baristas making the frothy coffee drinks for the hipsters next door, but I digress. On to my recent dining disaster.  Bodega pimps itself as a posh, classy, fine dining establishment. The only part of the dining experience that was fine or classy were the prices. We walk in 7PM Saturday night. We have reservations. We are seated right away. Unfortunately it was in front of a portion of the dining room curtained off for a private party that can only be described as raucous. Across from our table is a couple who appeared to have been living on public square and who had not bathed in at least a week. I don't mean to be a snob (ok well maybe I do) but if you want to go to a fine dining establishment. . . . PLEASE BATHE!   Our waiter is fairly quick to come for our orders which we shout to be heard over the party  I order Lemon drop martini 10 Lobster mac and cheese (for us to split as there wasn't much worth ordering on their tapas menu) 12 Jumbo tiger shrimp with mushroom ravioli 23  The boyfriend orders a stella 5 Mediterranean Seafood Pasta (special) 32  First come the drinks. His beer is draft beer kinda impossible to screw up.  My lemon drop however, tastes like rubbing alcohol no lemon and the sugar rim runs all the way down the stem. We have no water glasses so I can't even wipe the stem of my glass to unstickify it. Soon after the lobster mac n cheese comes. Ok so it's mac n cheese by definition nothing too difficult any first year culinary student can make a decent batch (as well as many American amateurs), this mac and cheese was GREASY and OILY and had way too much wine in it. The lobster meat is in HUGE chunks and over-cooked. We weren't impressed but it wasn't unpalatable. We just hope for a better experience with our entrées.   The entrées emerge from the kitchen. They both appear ok, but looks can be deceiving. For starters the shrimp in my entree was neither jumbo nor tiger (a minor culinary faux pas). The lobster meat in the Mediterranean pasta was chemically treated pollock aka imitation seafood (more than a minor faux pas). The shrimp in both entrées was majorly overcooked it was chewy dry and rubbery like a NERF ball. The pasta had a nice sauce with just enough curry to compliment the cream. The mushroom ravioli however was SYSCO (maybe I have the brand wrong but it was brought in) and not mushroom it was bland cheese. There was mushroom in the sauce. The sauce resembled Durkee brown gravy from powder though so it was anything but redeeming.   We asked to see a manager after a few bites each. He listens (well half-listens) takes our plates back to the kitchen. He returns and asks if we would like to try something else. I say absolutely not and that we refuse to pay for the entrées. He comps the entrées but we still have to pay for the drinks and app (bad customer service). We pay our bill and tip the poor waiter who was mortified all the while being watched by the bartender and manager who were giving us every old world curse imaginable.  Next morning I wake up very ill.  A word on desserts. They had 4 or 5 listed on the menu all obviously brought in from an outside vendor likely SYSCO.  Don't miss Driving past this place  Hit or miss um. . . service  Avoid like the plague Eating anything from this sad excuse for a restaurant"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place for the first time, and finally did last night. Entered the restaurant from the main entrance. The decor and design inside looked pretty nice. We were asked whether we'd prefer to sit inside our out. It was a nice day, so we chose to sit in their outdoor patio. We were seated right away. That was the only thing that we didn't have to wait a long time for. It took a while for a server to acknowledge our presence, after which we ordered the seafood ceviche as appetizer. As we were waiting for the ceviche, I figured the server would come back within a reasonable time to get our entree orders. She did not, and the ceviche took forever to arrive. I'm a fan of ceviche and I've had a few different variations. This one was \"meh\". They didn't even serve it with any crackers or the sort to eat it with. I had to ask for something, and we were given warmed rolls, which turned out to be a decent complement.  When she finally came back to take our orders, I ordered the seared duck with garlic mashed and asparagus. Wife ordered the chicken fez with a side of couscous. Again, it took a while to get our food, but we enjoyed our entrees. Well prepared with good flavors.  Then the server noticed we were done and came over to clear our table. Seemed like she was in a hurry and my wife asked for bread pudding for dessert as she was turning back towards the kitchen. A few minutes later, she drops off our check without the bread pudding. Had to wave her over a little later and asked where our bread pudding was. She apologized that she misunderstood - thought we wanted our check. Anyway, the bread pudding came... \"meh\" again. Had chunks of hard bananas, and the bread pudding itself was overall bland.  Lastly, if smoke bothers you avoid sitting in their patio. Not sure if this is common in most restaurants that have outdoor seating, but it seems they allow smoking. We were seated next to a party who were smoking. To make matters worse... their patio is located in the rear of the restaurant. Just as the inside, the patio is decorated very nicely. The ambiance is completely destroyed by the fact that they place at least 2 dumpsters (that I was able to see) right next to the seating area. Every time a breeze came by we got a good dose of dumpster waft. Horrible!  Overall, main course was good. Experience leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Living Social (LS) deal and ladies night caused many issues!   Living Social (LS) will not allow you the happy hour, which I understand. Today, apps  slash Tapas are half-off, but associated with LS or Groupon, it's not allowed, even if entrees had been sold to us on top of it.   Today they serve up half off bottles to ladies, but if you bring a guy, it's not allowed! If you use a living social, it's only 25%off, and if you let a guy taste it, all deals are off!    I have to say that I am not normally overly critical, having been in the industry for over a dozen years. I have never honestly seen so much red tape in order to utilize a Living Social Deal. Having experienced this, I can definitely see the writing on the wall that the establishment is choking for cash.   Purchased a groupon /living social, supposedly good for a certain dollar based on the coupon purchased, I could understand that happy hour deals are deleted from the package. So we paid for the entrees. They were fine and cooled correctly, but the wine was another ordeal. We ordered a bottle that was currently out of stock. Being a Thursday, most restaurants have already received their deliveries early in the week. The fact that the wine which is very esoteric slash not quick seller was out of stock was either a sign that the restaurant did not have the funds to fulfill an order with the Supplier, or that the wine list had not been updated for who knows how long. I was very excited to experience the 08 Spanish red. Sad face. I'm glad I tasted the next bottle which happened to be available by the glass. The barkeep claimed it had been opened for only a day, yet the wine had the inexplicable aroma showing off-ness, spoiled-ness, and acute flabbiness, all of which would not be present in a bottle opened even two days prior.  That was the second sign of issues in the wine. As a wine geek I give kudos for offering a Zweigelt by the glass, but the waste must be huge. Stop doing favors for your suppliers and do business with normal brands that might supply you with some commentary umbrellas next summer. Just saying!   Again, being in the industry we honestly would have been okay with the \"red tape\", had it been sold appropriately, reflected on the LS / Groupon, and felt like a true guest. There was obviously a \"script\" created in order to counteract every question on the Living Social / Groupon deals, which are clearly obsolete....I felt like a mortgag-ee losing my home trying to talk sense into a twelve year old supposed \"Licensed Loan Officer\".  It is apparent that the establishment bought in to the coupons-sites to bring a Quickie Guest. My advice- don't do it; rely on the talents of Chef and the clientele to gift you the repeat business factor, because this place does have an under-rated creative Chef and a similarly under-rated cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place it's very clean and their lobster macaroni and cheese is to die for. Oldie but goodie"}
{"text":"My wife and I just tried Bodega for the first time and it could NOT have been more disappointing.  The salad was too many greens with very little dressing but the worst was the fries which must have been sent back by another table and then sat out for about an hour before they thought it was a good idea to put it on our plate.  We will not be back and you should know not to try it.  There is too much good food in Cleveland to waste your time at Bodega."}
{"text":"Let me start with Bodega's ambiance.  Its a dimly lit spacious space along with plush booth style seating in the back that can be blocked off with curtain for larger parties.  As you step down into Bodega from the Coventry road entrance, you pass by  their live performance area ( a small cozy corner) and into the lounge area, further back you find the bar (almost to the very back).   The arrangement and placement of the bar seems very odd to me.  It's almost as if the bar was an after-thought.  The bar is angled and one-third of the bar opposite to the kitchen.  This fact would have been fine except due to its angular placements,  if you are seated in that one-third you are should-to-shoulder as the wait staff ferry food from the kitchen.  The noise, smoke from kitchen, and foot traffic can be quite distracting to your enjoyment.   In my opinion the front part of seating and ambiance is done well.  The bar and back part requires some more thought planning to maximize the space as well as mesh with the rest of the effect.  Check out pictures of the bar as well as the seating space.  I sat at the bar during my visit.  The bar tender was prompt and attentive to our needs.    It was  a quiet night with very few other patrons.   The noise level was very quiet.  There was middle eastern (maybe Moroccan to be specific) modern music playing in the background.  At times, the music seemed loud but other times it seemed normal.   I had a Bloddy Martini - a blend between a bloddy marry and martini.  I found this drink to be far too much a bloddy marry than a martini.  I feel this martini could be toned down on the 'bloddy' side and tone up on the 'tini' aspects.  Our tapas were Kobe Beef Moroccan Sliders, House Made Hummus, and Dijon Herb Crusted Lamb Lollipops.  The beef sliders were topped with Harissa Aioli and served with crispy shallots.  The kobe beef patties were prepared medium well as recommended and were of a small burger portion.  The two burgers are definitely larger than a typical slider.   These were well made and carefully prepared.  The Aioli was a good pairing to the taste and enjoyment of these burgers.  The house made Hummus was served with cubed feta cheese, kalamata olives, a mini Dolma and warm pita bread.  The Hummus was good and not overpowering of garlic or Tahini and was not too runny or too chunky.  The dolma was warm and the pita was served warm and airy.    The lamb lollipops are made with dijon mustard, herb pesto, panko bread crumbs, over mashed potatoes & madeira infused demi- glace.  I found the mustard-pesto-panko bread crumbs topping to be far too salty.  After I scraped off the topping the lamb chop itself was tender and tasty.  The mashed potato with demi-glace was prepared quite well and offer a curious yet tasty combination of flavors and texture.  Overall,  I have to admit that I have had better than Bodega.  It could be nice stop over for before or after dinner dinner drinks or for light bites on a long night out.  There are definitely some aspects Bodega is doing well,  however, there are definitely more room for improvement.   If I'm in the area I might stop by again to compare and contrast for consistency with their other Tapas and Bodega Plates.   They are surely upto something with this establishment on Coventry Road.  I would love to see them up their game as time passes."}
{"text":"I adore this place it's a home away from home being that the cuisine is just as delicious as it was when they first opened several years ago. Why tinker with something if it isn't broken. The lobster mac & cheese is always cooked to perfection, the calamari is soft with a delicate crunch, the shrimp au gratin is a tongue teaser, honestly I've sampled the entire menu and have yet to be disappointed. What I love about their menu is that the classics I've grown to love, the entrees and wine selections that keep me coming back have remained the same and I'm happy to say I am a loyal customer for LIFE. Even though at times the service could be slightly improved I continue to enjoy myself dish after dish time and time again!!"}
{"text":"Great food great music love coming here service is great street park tho but overall I love coming here"}
{"text":"This place is an overlooked gem in Coventry.   Pros: - Extensive menu (American, Mediterranean, and Moroccan) that is well executed. Usually, when a menu is too big, the taste takes a hit. I highly recommend their hummus, lobster mac-n-cheese, braised short ribs, moule frites, seafood paella, and soy-chili wings. - Portion sizes are almost stupid big. My husband and I ordered a paella, and it was big enough to feed 4 people. - Reasonably priced, fantastic specials throughout the week, and there is always a Groupon - Service is good, especially if you let them know it's a special occasion for you.   Cons: Despite the luxe trappings and mood lighting, the space feels a bit cavernous to me, and just doesn't quite hit that note of \"intimate.\"  Overall, solid restaurant, and I'd recommend it for date nights, after work drinks, or a girl's night out."}
{"text":"My brother had a groupon for this place so we decided to go here for dinner. My brother had been here before and said his experience was 3 1/2 stars. He did say almost everything on the menu was out.   Arrived around 8pm on a Saturday. Only two other families were there. Beautiful decor. Very modern and an overall warm feeling.   Ordering: Waiter gave the specials and we ordered martinis which took a bit to make it to the table but they were pretty good.  To start tried the tuna tartare. The color seemed a bit off to me and it had a little bit of a fishy smell. A friend from japan told me fish only starts to smell fishy when it's on it's way out. I was hesitant but hungry lol so forks up! It was pretty good but a little bland and lacking flavor. The avocado should of had like garlic salt and pepper mixed in or something.  The salt was missing. For my entree ordered the short ribs which the waiter tells me its out. My brother tells me they were out the last time as well. My guess is they only order so much because they don't have a lot of business then run out super fast. Most people will order this item. So it boggles my mind why they get so little.  As a back up I get hanger steak over a red pepper salad with mash potatoes on the side. My steak was medium rare in some places, medium and medium well in others. I asked for medium. The flavor was pretty tasty though. The roasted red pepper salad was long strips of red pepper and poorly pickled onions underneath and arugula on top. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and lacked any flavor or salt.  My brother ordered one of the specials which was stuffed seafood salmon. Which was salmon stuffed with shrimp and crab that came with a cream sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The cream sauce was excellent.  I kept dipping my steak in it. The salmon was really good as well. The only frown on that is some restaurants leave the blood line in the fish which makes that bite taste muddy or just off. (Blood line=brown strip in middle of fish). I give his entree 4 stars.   Conclusion: Service was ok and food was average.  They really need to flavor things more.  The food was not worth $114 ..but it was worth $54 which is what we paid after the groupon.  I would say check it out if need be but don't have high expectations. I can think of many other places worth $114. I will say our tummies were a little sour after. Maybe the tuna? Not sure but nothing too bad."}
{"text":"Go here for 1/2 OFF TAPAS on Tuesday nights! Or 1/2 off Tapas & bottles of wine for ladies on Thursday nights!  That's the only reason why I come to this restaurant.. cheap I know.   My favorite tapas are: Lobster mac + cheese, Lobster risotto, Seafood Ceviche, and the Kobe sliders. The calamari is pretty decent there too.  Most of my servers have been pleasant, but there is one lady who is snotty and rude.. probably looks down on us because we're coming here for the tapas special. Other than that, I have an overall great experience every time I come to Bodega!   I recently took a big group of my girlfriends there, and all of them loved it. :) And for a lot of tapas split between us, we spent about $10-11 total (tip+gratuity included), and walked out satisfyingly full."}
{"text":"We first tried this restaurant due to the fact that we had a Restaurant.com coupon for $100 off of our meal if we spent $100.  It also included alcohol so we dove right in. Fiancee really enjoyed the dark, romantic atmosphere.  Service was great including the suggestion by our waiter to serve my manhattan with Rye instead of bourbon.  Great wine and drink selection and the food is above average for the area.  Last time we were here they gave us complimentary hookah so that we would stay there instead of going down the street to City and East.  Class act here.  Only complaint is that it gets very crowded late on Friday and Saturday and management of the establishment doesn't do a good job of ensuring egress."}
{"text":"After reading the complaints about the slow service, we had prepared ourselves for a long wait, but the service was great. Out waitress came to our table to order before we even decided on what we wanted. She was friendly and brought our food out promptly. Even the chef came out to say hello so we have no complaints about the service.  We ordered the hummus, the lobster risotto and the mushroom ravioli with shrimp (can't remember what the name of this was on the menu), and the chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was amazing. The food was a Moroccan and American fusion. I think my favorite part was the bread at the table which came with a dipping oil. It was so soft, and warm that we could tell that it was made fresh. The risotto and the ravioli were both heavy yet delicious. The chocolate cake was nicely presented and also delicious. We had a great experience and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I picked Bodega for my birthday as soon as I saw its Moroccan menu and I'm glad I did. Everything was excellent. I started with the lobster macaroni and cheese appetizer. This is a good one to share because they give you a lot and you want room for the rest of your meal. I then had the lamb mrouzia for the main course with a side of couscous and it was excellent too. My wife had the mixed grill, which has lamb, beef, and chicken on skewers. I expected this to be less interesting but the meat was real tasty.   Finally, we had bread pudding and chocolate cake for dessert, both winners. We'll have some for later on, too, as we got doggy bags because there was more than we could eat.   The service was friendly and efficient, all good. This will definitely be a good restaurant to come back to."}
{"text":"My food was amazing (had pasta) my husbands food was not to his liking. Told the waiter and he told the owner who was a piece of work to put it nicely. Because of the owner I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Cleveland Height's finest!!!! The sliders are heavenly as well.as the curry pasta... Run, don't walk to this amazing restaurant! Cool vibe too!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough things I can RAVE about when it comes to this place. For starters, I had my sons baby shower here 3 years ago and it was phenomenal! Last night I went for a birthday dinner. We sat on the patio. The ambiance is to die for. You feel as if you've just stepped into a small town in Morocco. Live music, sultry lighting...perfect for a romantic date night. Our server was attentive and lively, he enhanced our experience. Just ask for the gentleman with the full ginger beard (lol). We were approached by who I thought to be the owner and manager and they asked how our experience was as well. The food was excellent--(food orgasm for sure). Great selections and big portions. The martinis were strong. I can go on forever. If you want to be pampered, this place is a must try. They were thorough on every element and the experience was one for the books!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Bodega. I have dined here a few times and everything was pretty good. This time, however, things did not go so well.  For the price I would have paid, I expected better.  My Fiance's birthday was yesterday and we decided to take a walk. After the the walk, we were hungry. Bodega sounded really good and being that it was a Thursday evening I felt that we stood a pretty good chance of being able to sit immediately. We were right!  We walked in and within a few moments we were seated. We ordered some beverages and the waiter brought us some waters. Unfortunately things were already starting to go wrong.  The outdoor patio area is surrounded by trash. When I say trash, I am saying literal trash. There are huge grease dumpsters and terrible smells wafting around back there. We almost decided to switch and sit inside. However, knowing our drinks and food would be out soon we decided to fight through the pain and stay outside. To be honest, the smell seemed to go away shortly there after.  When our first drinks were brought to the table my fiance noticed something odd. Her wine glass had something floating in it. Luckily it was just some of the cork. I could understand this going unnoticed in a dimly lit bar or even at a friends house over an $8 bottle of wine but we are talking about what was likely an $8 GLASS of wine. Being that it was just cork, we decided not to mention anything about it and just kept to ourselves until our food arrived.  The appetizer came (baked brie) and we devoured it in seconds. This was the star moment of the entire dining experience.  Shortly after, the main entree's arrived. Fantastic! Or so we thought. As my fiance started to cut into her chicken it became apparent that the food was barely cooked. Let me emphasize this - her chicken was basically RAW. I picked up her plate and walked it inside where the staff waits around and said   Me: \"Excuse my but I believe her chicken is...\" Waiter: \"Under cooked?\"  Picture trying to cut through some chicken on your dinner plate and the whole piece of chicken is just raw.  They told us how sorry they were and that they would get us a new plate immediately. My fiance no longer wanted the same chicken so I gave her my plate of food and just told them to bring another plate of exactly what I received.  They decided to be nice and get us free drinks. The drinks came to the table and my beer glass was so disgustingly dirty that I could not take even a single sip from it. My fiances wine glass was covered in lipstick stains.  I informed the waiter of this and again they were super sorry.  This was quite possibly the worst birthday experience. However, they brought us a $40 gift certificate and 2 free pieces of cake. The waiter/manager decided to take care of our entire check (i offered to still pay it because we did end up eating at least one entree). They then also informed me that they had just hired something like 7 new staff members. Because they handled the situation well I felt the waiter did their job. I left a $20 tip and we walked out the side entrance.  Just for an idea of what we ordered as I feel that it helps explain the experience.  Food Ordered: -Baked Brie: $15 -Grilled Amish Chicken: $23 -Grilled Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: $23 -2 blue moons (one complementary) -2 glasses pinot noir (one complementary) -1 piece of chocolate cake (complementary) -1 piece of weird tasting bread pudding (complementary)  So basically, we would have spent at least $80 with tip.  Conclusion: If you are going to spend $80+ for dinner for two people then it better be right. There are too many restaurants in Cleveland that we could have gone to. Due to our poor experience it is highly unlikely that we will ever go back. However, they did take care of us in the proper way. Taking care of our food and giving us complementary drinks, dessert, and a $40 gift card was a really great way to handle things.  Note: Found this on their online menu. $15 minimum credit card charges. 18% gratuity added to parties of 6 or more.  $15 sharing fee on our featured offers and a $5 sharing/split fee on our regular entrees"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, not sure how this place is only in the 3 star range. It is one of the best I have ever been to.  A true 5 star place.  The decor is awesome, very classy modern style with a nice bar top. They have nice couches inside as well on the romantic patio. Really like the options they provide to fit your dining style.  The food was amazing; the tossed green salad was perfect, the nice touches of great dressing, quality parmesan flakes and gourmet olives made this salad stand out from others I've had.  The bread they give you is so soft and bursting with flavor, they really got some skills in the bread arts.  I had the Fez Chicken, which was a dish consisting of sautéed sweet onions, ginger, cinnamon, honey, raisins and garnished with roasted almonds. The chicken was very tender and juicy. Very unique combination and delicious, very uncommon flavor. I also tried a bite of my beautiful girlfriends Lobster Mac, wow is it amazing. They have a ton of great options, can't wait to try more.  The waiter Mike was the best we have had (Sorry New Orleans French Quarter Waiter, you're #2 now). Great personality, passion, and overall knowledge. Really great guy, glad he was our waiter.  This place gives a great overall experience, the food is more Moroccan based, so it may be different than what you are used to since they use many different spices and flavors that aren't always traditional in America, but they do have some more common options as well. If you like this type of food or want something unique this is the place. As I said before definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the martinis here at BODEGA. It's good for happy hour. Nice lounge feel. Never crowded but a good place to relax and have a drink. The food is delicious! I enjoyed the wings, fries (previously,  not this occasion ) and a lobster pasta that I foget the name of."}
{"text":"Living within a mile of this place, I now wonder why I never stopped in sooner.  Decor is very modern, lighting a bit dark.  We had a large group, and sat at the largest table, which accomodates up to ten.  Nice menu, with tapas, bodega plates, entrees and desserts.  Also had several nice specials.  Emphasis is on seafood, which is OK with me.  None in my party tried the beef offerings.  Mussels were yummy.  Seafood ceviche was great.  Raw oysters good.  Salads were nicely size and very fresh.  Entrees were great.  Duck was flavorful, well cooked.  We tried several of the salmon entrees, all were great.  Wine list is extensive, with a nice variety of selections.  Full bar as well.  Good dessert selection, bread pudding very nice.  Service was attentive, but expect a leisurely pace -- it took us two hours for three courses.  Overall, great experience, will return when we want a nice meal in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place except the decor. They are quite pricy. Was there with a party of 9 and I ordered the kobe sliders with fries. Since the sliders were thicker than I expected they would be, I thought maybe they would have asked me how I wanted it cooked. Anyway, this was not the first time I've had this beef but it was nothing to write home about and the fries were quite mediocre. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Definitely come here during their 1/2 off Tapas nights!!!  On Thursdays, Bodega is ladies night with 1/2 off Tapas and wine/beer. Then, on Tuesdays, it's 1/2 off Tapas for everyone. Because of that, I can only speak for their Tapas. But, bodega has NEVER ONCE disappointed me.. and i've been here about 5, 6 times now.   By now, I've probably tried everything on their tapas menu and i have not yet found a dish I would not recommend. You really can't screw up on your ordering over here. If I had to pick my top 2-3 foods here, it would be: Seafood Cerviche, Calamari, and Seared Foie Gras.   I know, I know... I probably look like some seafood whore, and i am. I love seafood and in Cleveland, it is HARD to find restaurants that can actually make good seafood dishes, and Bodega is the place to be!!   I have to spend a good few seconds telling you about the Seafood Cerviche though. The sauce is soo perfect on this dish and the squid is so fresh. THis dish... it's just Bodega at its perfection! If you like seafood or eat it, I plead you to try it!  As far as those who don't eat seafood, I would then recommend the slider and the lobster mac & cheese. Yes, lobster mac & cheese has seafood but it's so little you can take it out. The mac & cheese is YUM YUM YUMM!!!  Either way, PLEASE TRY BODEGA. This place is just so amazing! And, its's probably the classiest place in coventry."}
{"text":"This place does a few things well, but our dinner was a complete disaster.   Our waiter spent half his time boasting about how long he'd worked there and the other half of the time trying to bump up our bill. Yet he spent the entire time missing the essentials. For example, he came to take our orders having not noticed that we didn't have menus. He repeatedly missed the mark, but never missed a chance to suggest a more expensive dish or use command language like, \"and what do you want as a starter?\" His tactics were offensive because it was obvious that he wasn't there to take care of us as much as himself.   Lobster Mac n' cheese is not tapas, sorry guys. In fact, nothing on the Tapas section of your menu would be considered tapas anywhere else.   There was no salt and pepper on the table and none in the kitchen. Food was bland and lacked seasoning. I didn't trust the authenticity of the dishes so I opted for something safe with the short ribs (Mediterranean?). The dish was tepid at best. The meat was tough for short ribs and not scored, leaving large fatty chunks for me to cut off myself. Clearly no one in this kitchen expedites looking at the dishes and considering if it looks like something they would want to eat.   At one point the chef came out of the kitchen and asked how we liked everything. An awkward silence fell over the table as our party of ten was collectively not impressed. No one wanted to make the situation more awkward by telling him the many things that weren't good about the meal. The chef looked perturbed that we did not have anything to say so he crossed his arms and starred at us for a while. That was totally comfortable, way to check your ego dude!   Then the waiter comes with the tab telling us that the house normally adds 18% gratuity for large parties, but he didn't add the 18% because he felt that he should only be tipped on what we thought was right. It couldn't have been more obvious that he was bucking for a larger tip than 18%. It was so obnoxious, I just wanted to tell him to shut up.   I wouldn't return to this place to use the bathroom. The food is absurdly over-priced and the pretentious, pushy staff would ruin a meal even if the food was decent."}
{"text":"Ate here on 9/19 - food excellent as always, the lobster nachos are fabulous as well as the hummus, good drinks, the filet dish is very good, deserts are good as well. Look on restaurants.com for a discounted \"coupon\". The service however this evening was disappointing. Very very slow, made the evening drag on, I hope on our next visit it has improved. You can also make reservations via opentable.com"}
{"text":"There was a group of 3 of us that came to dine later in the evening. We made reservations and they were not quick to greet us. The place inside was not crowded but there were 2 big parties seated. When we finally got seated, we were greeted by our waitress. I wanted to order a bottle of wine for the table and the girl gave us a sample of red wine. The person I was with was not really familiar with reds so she wasn't sure.  We asked for another sample and she did bring another sample. But this time she did have an attitude and said this wouldn't be a good time to try red if you really don't like it. I was also asking questions about the menu and she rushed me off said I have other tables to attend to.   After we decided on a white wine, we also placed our food order as well. She brings the bottle of wine and said she would bring bread to the table. She never brought the bread and the girl who filled our water was the one who brought us bread after I requested it. The waitress never came back.    Once the food was served, it was actually flavorful. I ordered the Mediterranean seafood pasta and it was tasty. I can't complain about the food but I don't like the service there. The food is not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant.  The atmosphere was fantastic! They had a piano player and singer tonight. It was beautiful. The low lighting, the drapes, the candles. It was absolutely beautiful.   My husband and I were celebrating this evening and he took me to Bodega. Our server was Mike. Very friendly, he picked our meal for us.  Our starters were the tuna tartar and the lamb lollipops. Both were so flavorful. The tartar reminded me of Hawaii.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delightful. I wanted to try the quail because I've never had it. So, I did and WOW! It tasted how I thought quail should taste. A bit gamey and nothing like chicken which was a huge surprise.  I absolutely loved it! I will most definitely order it again. My husband ordered the lamb and it was incredible!  It was an awesome night. I do wish our server paid a bit more attention to us. He was super friendly, but I only saw him when he was delivering food. When you spend $150 on a meal, a little bit of attention goes a long way. More water, bread, etc.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is fairly decent. Service fairly deplorable. We've been to Bodega several times over the last few years. It has always been pretty hit and miss. And that goes from course to course. Some dishes will be delectable and others atrocious. Poor service has been consistent. Dined with a party of three on a Friday. Decided to go all tapas for our meal and ordered a good cross section from the tapas menu. Stuffed quail, Lamb Lollipops, and truffled pomme frites were highlights. Several disappointments included lobster nachos (barely any lobster), tuna tartar, and seared foie gras. Martinis were lacking in flavor and booze - we quickly switched to wine because the wine list was extensive and cocktails were sad.  Our disappointments were exacerbated by our relative clueless server. Don't want to call him out, but his name starts with a P. - so good luck. When we were served our tuna tartar which consisted of a pretty paltry portion of seemingly over-seared tuna on top of a too generous bed of arugula which was basically frosted lightly with avocado like a birthday cake, I mentioned to P. that there was an awful lot of greens in proportion to the other ingredients on tuna tartar. He smiled, said OK, and walked away. When we were served a fois gras dish that included one delicious piece of perfectly cooked liver and a second that was so overcooked it looked like a cat turd on a bed of surprisingly delicious mushroom risotto, we had to try and track P. down. He had no clue what to do. He finally tracked down a manager who had us pick up the cat turd risotto and place it on a bread plate for her so she could take it to the kitchen for some reason. Why wouldn't she just take the whole plate it was served on back you may ask? When you have an answer let me know. Because I knew what was coming. While I was waiting for the new slice of fois gras to be prepared, that aforementioned tasty risotto was getting cold. I'm not going to eat it while waiting for a new piece of fois. Which took way longer than it should. So then a sad little piece of new fois is delivered from P. and I mention the cold risotto to go with it. Do I eat this with the cold risotto I ask? Yeah he says, and walks away.  Kicker to this is that the refired fois gras comes out cold and undercooked. Apparently at this point, P. is scared of us because we do not see him for another 10 minutes. When he comes back we tell him about the cold fois and he does eventually track down the manager again who argues immediately about our cold risotto and how I should have asked her to redo the entire dish if that's what I wanted. I disagree that this should be on me, but I assure her that not being able to enjoy an entire composed dish with all warm components was a 10 minute ago problem, now we have the cold fois to deal with. She did take this off the bill, but it was bittersweet as this dish could have been the best thing we were served if everything was cooked properly. As it was the cold slice of fois sat untouched and wasted on our table - a fate no fois gras should have to suffer. No additional refire was offered.  After this, P, did not want to come anywhere near our table and we wanted to order more food and another bottle of wine. Spent plates piled up in front of us and water glasses were not refilled. Had to practically jump out of our chairs to flag him down at this point. Don't be scared of the table when the kitchen is messing up; not your fault. But you make it your fault when you avoid us.  Overall, I think this was probably our last try at Bodega. We had a restaurant.com gift certificate, but without that, I would have been even more disappointed with the value for the money."}
{"text":"Best service in Cleveland Heights area!  We don't want to leave. Nibbles were great. Hummus was great, scallops could have been cooked another 15 seconds, and rested on a bed of lettuce less peppery."}
{"text":"Love the location (trendy, eclectic Coventry) and décor (chic, upscale, lounge-like) of this place! First went for my birthday with a few girlfriends and had a ball (mainly drinks)! I like that it's not a large, overbearing restaurant, but quite cozy and quaint. The second time around, I took my mother for her birthday; there weren't many people in there, but that worked out perfectly. We had the stuffed quail with creamed corn - very tender and seasoned perfectly; duck; quite tasty and cooked to perfection; and the bread pudding which mum loved was a decent serving. Service was on point. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening to celebrate a birthday, not really knowing what to expect. Our reservation wasn't necessary as it wasn't busy at all. It was clean and modern-looking, although I agree with previous comments about the chairs - not comfortable. Looking over the menu, I was completely shocked at the prices. The menu online is not accurate - they've raised some of the prices. $12 for hummus? $15 for two stuffed peppers? Even the best restaurants in Cleveland aren't charging those prices. Based on the prices, we had high expectations for the food and the service. Both my parents ordered lobster bisque, which for some reason took 15-20 minutes to come out and didn't actually have lobster in it. We waited another 10-15 for chicken wings. Our waiter told us at one point he'd be bringing us bread, which we never received. One of us ordered seafood pasta ($30) which was probably the best thing I tasted - but still, completely overpriced. Overall nothing we ate was terrible, but certainly not worth the price tag, and service was just so-so. There are so many better values and much better food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Needs a bit of updating. Carpet was a bit tattered music was cool...at first... it was Latin! Unfortunately then went into weird top 20s rock...just didn't flow with the atmosphere or the crowd.  Couches a bit tattered and artwork was hung in odd formations. Staff was extremely good. It's been a long time since I paid over $10 for a glass of red blend."}
{"text":"On my return trip, I think it's worth bumping this one up a star.  Coventry needs a classy cocktail lounge, and this place provides.  Was super-quiet on a Sunday night.  I was hoping it would be a bit more lively, but there are plenty of loud venues in the neighborhood, and some contrast is nice."}
{"text":"We took a weekend trip to Cleveland for our anniversary and had dinner here. The outdoor seating is very nice, and the indoor has an amazing vibe. Most importantly, the food was incredible!! I had the seafood stuffed salmon and it was absolutely perfect. Our server was so sweet, and even worked to accommodate my drink order that they no longer served - she recommended something similar and doctored it up a little for me. Would definitely recommend this place. Wish it was closer to us in Columbus!!"}
{"text":"I decided to meet up with some old friends and someone suggested Bodega. Good location, cozy restaurant with beautiful decor. The crab nachos and calamari were delicious! I had one of the daily specials... salmon stuffed with crab, asparagus and mashed potato for my entree! It was amazing. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"The food is ver good when they get your to go order right. I ordered a chicken salad didn't get my chicken.  Then they had no what for me to get a credit??? They should also update their online menu, half the time you call in they don't have what's on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is total garbage. The owner is a drugged out pompous jerk who thinks he's the best chef in the world, the bartenders are rude self-righteous dirt-bags who expect a generous tip even when they serve you an extremely watered down drink. The ice-machine rarely is cleaned, I once found a black mold-like thing in my ice; when I told the waiter about it, he acted as if I put it there. The majority of the food is overpriced. The \"fresh\" food is all stored in a freezer on the side of the bar. Don't be surprised if you end up with food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"This review is entirely for the ability to get escargot and foie gras in the middle of the night. I mean, that is truly impressive. These guys are killing it with the food, the ambiance and basically, the whole package."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here (that I can remember...oy!), but I can say that I enjoy drinking here. Is it cheap? Nope. But I'm worth it, darn it.   With a trendy atmosphere and blasting music, this is a great place to grab a drink with friends, chill on a couch and chat, or dance on top of a coffee table. Anything goes.   This is definitely nicer than any other bar on the street and you pay the price for that - but the upscale pricing helps to keep drunken college kids out. Something I'm completely ok with. Leave this nice place to us drunken old folks.   Worth checking out if you're in the area, like mixed drinks, and want a more adult evening."}
{"text":"I was hurt about the price of this stuffed salmon, but Lord have mercy!!! It is so worth it! This is delicious and the portion is huge! Everything is cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many great comments about this restaurant, my fiancé and I decided to have dinner here as part of our monthly date-nights. The decor was quite lovely and modern; however, the chairs were not comfortable and reminded me of ones for the patio. We were seated at a four-top table  lined with a white tablecloth. The dinner menu presented to us was expansive and included a variety of standard dishes as well as Moroccan ones. We decided to start with the Escargot de Marseille and Moule Frite. Right off, our orders came out wrong. Instead of the Moule Frite, we received the Truffle Pomme Frite. When our correct order arrived, we were already finished with the Escargot de Marseille, which, never had eaten them before, was quite tasty. The Moule Frite was not what we were expecting: steak-fries covering small mussels. The mussels were mediocre and the fries weren't even eaten. Big disappointment!  Hoping our entrees would save the evening, we ordered the Jumbo Tiger Shrimp with Mushroom Ravioli and the Tangier Seafood Paella. Now, the last time I had paella was at a spanish restaurant in Cleveland. It was the most amazing dish I had ever had at the time. I was soooo disappointed at the dish that was presented to me that evening. The portion was large (expected); however, the seafood was not fresh or cooked properly at all! The clams were chewy, the octopus (which wasn't even on the menu) was tough, and the rice lacked saffron and tasted bland. The chicken was juicy and tasty, as were the other vegetables: tomatoes and sweet peas. The other dish, the Jumbo Tiger Shrimp with Mushroom Ravioli, was ordered by my fiancé and he said that it was cooked well and delicious. I was jealous!  Thinking now, I will give them one more chance with the desserts, we ordered the Tiramisu and Baklava. He said the Tiramisu was better than what he's had before and said it was a good dish. AGAIN, disappointment prevailed on my dish: the Baklava. I know how difficult baklava is made; it takes lots of time and patience to make the perfect dessert. I was not looking for perfection here. However, I was looking to have a dish actually made in the kitchen and not microwaved. How could i tell it was microwaved? It came out hot (which it is served room-temperature) and after a few minutes, it started to harden (like what microwaved cheese does). Not only was it not made, it came out drizzled in caramel and chocolate sauce! No! It does not need those things because the sweetness from the honey is enough. I did not even finish it up because I didn't have a knife to cut it and it was already nearing rock hard.  After hearing so many accolades for this place, I will have to disagree based on my experience. There are so many other far better restaurants I will choose to dine at and spend my money. My fiancé suggests we try the place again and this time order basic, non-fancy food. My thought: if they have it on the menu, it ought to be executed well the first time. Otherwise, do not have it on the menu. This diner comes back when she is pleased with the first experience."}
{"text":"This place was a letdown. Went here on a Friday night with my sister for a birthday celebration. I hated the lounge seating with coffee tables as an eating space. I may as well have dribbled all my food on the floor/myself. Good news is that the food was tasty for the most part. Fries, lobster bisque, mac and cheese, I liked it all. The drinks were another story though. Water-y and not even a hint of alcohol.   What really sealed the two star review for this was the waiter. He was so clearly overwhelemed and took that out on us.He was also extremely snappy about comments made. For instance, when I mentioned that a mixed drink was barely even over half full in the glass, he told me off for questioning his mixology skills. Unfortunately, it was automatic gratuity. In actuality he would not have earned a 20% tip. SO OVERALL, if you enjoy poor drinks and rude service then I guess this is the place."}
{"text":"The food was very underwhelming and not impressive - there are so many better restaurants in Cleveland for the price point. The \"tapas\" are not actual tapas that you would expect from Spain. The decor and environment is cheap (I believe you will be sitting on white ikea chairs) and almost club like with weird black \"leather\" futons. Identity crisis. The waiter was nice but wasn't efficient at all."}
{"text":"Great environment great food! No a ton of vegetarian dishes but they are accommodating subbing meats with veggies. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Found parking across the street (24 hour meters - .25 per 30 minutes; first 30 minutes free; I was told that banking parking lot across the street at night is free). It's a little misleading when going in at first because it's connected to a store, but the restaurant is in the bottom, very snazzy/elegant, ambiance totally shifts. They had happy hour half off appetizers/tapas and wines (~$20 -- was a bit taken aback when I got the bill). Ordered duck (very good!), mash potatoes and asparagus (both overcooked). I loved the ambiance and duck. Service was nice too. But wish I knew about the $20 glass of wine and the rest of the food was too cooked. It's not that I didn't like it. It was just a bit too pricey for the value. By the way, it seemed like everything was accompanied by mash potatoes and asparagus, no much creativity."}
{"text":"Bodega is a pretty room. It's the kind of place you feel like lounging around and getting slowly sloshed in while chatting up pretty people with pretty accents whose origins you can't quite place. Or maybe that's just me. My only complaint on the food was the \"ceviche\" my husband and I ordered. Mainly because I strongly suspect that it was actually boiled seafood soaked in a not altogether unpleasant sauce of some kind. In any case it was dry and rubbery and I wouldn't order it again. The stuffed quail, however, I kind of can't stop thinking about. Crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and don't even get me started on the heavenly creamed corn it's served over. I don't even like creamed corn, but I couldn't stop dipping my bread, truffle fries, or spoon for that matter in the stuff. The service kind of sucked; everything was fine until it was time for the check and then the guy took FOREVER. Hate that."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a date night. Food was incredible! The service was great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Bodega for my wife's birthday, along with my two daughters. Ordered two glasses of wine, 3 appetizers and 4 main courses. Service was fine, appetizers were ok, hummus exceptional, lobster nachos unremarkable. My daughter ordered a burger with no bun (she is gluten intolerant) she asked for cheese on it. Waitress came back and said that the chef said that would be a $1 extra.... Really??? On a $150 tab.... My Carne Asada was over cooked (ordered med.. Came well). Burger over cooked (med well... Came well).  Overall missed the mark and was insulted on having to pay $1 for a slice of cheese even not ordering the bun."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place ( I've come one more time 4 years ago but that was just for drinks). My server was Mike (according to our receipt) and he was the perfect server, attentive but not over bearing. The food was amazing and flavorful as always. The atmosphere is a romantic - dimmed lights, etc. Perfect for a special event like an anniversary but also relaxing for a group. Overall, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just fantastic food! Bread was a little too salty for my taste though. Otherwise great place! I loved their patio! Will definitely go back! Or waitress was awesome and attentive too! Thanks Julie!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Beautiful decor and nice people.  I've been four times.  Each time, more irritating.  Good variety of food with and unbeliveable price range.  In theory, something for everyone.  I had a $9 draft beer at Happy Hour.   Food is varied and wildly inconsistent.  They will not last long.  I have never seen it half full.  Again, great job cleaning up the space.  Should have spent the same amount of time on the menu/"}
{"text":"Unlike my fellow yelpers who have reviewed this place a whiles ago, I thought Bodega was great.  I was surprised at the decor of the place when I walked in. Comfortable couches, great layout, great ambiance- a great place for a date or just a classier place to hang out with your friends. Definitely a lot better than your other Coventry/w.6th places. I put it up there with Velvet Tango Room.  I admit, I didn't try the entire menu, so I can't give it a full review. Nor did I try the drinks. This place is super comfortable- we sat in the comfy white couches off to the side, and ordered some appetizers/tapas. The place was really empty (I think it's more because no one knows about this place), but we still enjoyed it nonetheless.  We got three small plates. First off, the CALAMARI was so good. It was cooked surprisingly well, and was covered with a thick sweet/sour sauce blended with wasabi. So good. We also got the mussels- which was cooked well as well. Lastly, we got the stuffed quail- I was surprised how good the marinade was- it was some kind of sweeter soy sauce glaze, and the stuffing inside consisted of prosciutto and gruyere cheese with sweet corn/truffle oil on the side. Omg, we were so surprised at how good it was...although, we left it until the end. I had only had quail in cut-up form at Cantonese restaurants...he had never had quail.... so when it came out.. as the full body without its head... it took us a little while to get used to. hahah. Once we cut into it.... Mmmmmmm. So good.  The waiter was great as well. He knew his menu, through and through. I always hate it when the wait staff is reading off their menu or is like, \"I've never tried it.\" In my head I'm always thinking, \"really? REALLY??\" This guy knew his stuff. Kudos to that.   Great place. I definitely recommend this restaurant/lounge/place to grab drinks. It's such a great place- I'm definitely going back. I rarely give out five stars, but for Cleveland, I give Bodega five stars, all the way."}
{"text":"The food was great and the ambiance was amazing. The server was really efficient and friendly. There was an area to relax and hang out after for cocktails after eating. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"First off this is not a place for a large party. So if are considering think twice. This service here is extremely slow. The atmosphere here is chic besides me tripping over a rug because they decided to roll up a rug and not tuck it in. So we finally sat down and looked at a menu. The menu was paper and had food stains and crumbs stuck on it. I was disgusted... . They ran out of clean cups and told us to wait  mind you that the restaurant is not crowded.    I ordered the Braised beef short ribs it came with asparagus and mashed potatoes, it was delicious and my wife ordered the stuff salmon which also was delicious. i preferred the the braised beef over the stuff salmon."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Not a single vegan option on the menu. Asked if there was any egg or dairy in the VEGETARIAN  Couscous and they replied with \"it's made with chicken broth\"! Never coming back."}
{"text":"The place was not very busy when we went on Tuesday night. The server was very knowledgeable and gave his recommendations of menu items to us and explained how the menu was set up. He was training someone while he served us and they both were friendly. He explained the chef/owner is from Morocco and that the best menu items were from the Heart of Morocco section of the menu, also the part of the menu with the largest dishes. The fez chicken did not disappoint. The chicken was served with a wonderful mix of sweet onions, ginger, cinnamon, honey, raisins and roasted almonds. The portion size was good too.   If you don't want Moroccan food there are many tapas and smaller entrees that are not Moroccan themed - the waiter said they are known for their mac-n-cheese.  We ordered baklava for dessert - it was served warm with a chocolate drizzle, both of which I had never had before with baklava.   With a $30 for $60 Groupon, dinner was an absolute deal! I would definitely come back - I want to go on Wednesday for Moroccan tea and belly dancing."}
{"text":"The food was good, as always and the service was great.  We ordered the escargot, which was delish, and the lobster mac and cheese, which was great, as always.  However, my favlorite salad there has been changed and no longer includes hearts of palm or the light lemon dressing, but rather now has mozzerella balls and a heavier dressing.  Still tasty, but not as good.  In addition, there was a small private party booked that night, and the online reservations were not working and the restaurant was FREEZING.  But we will be back, of course, for the great food!"}
{"text":"Nice little place just around the corner from us... it's actually our second time there, but review would have been the same both times.  We went for a late dinner on July 4th... we work crazy shifts/hours and needed to eat on a national holiday.  They were open, friendly, and had great service.  We got the quail, hanger steak, and the paella to share.  The quail was delicious but a little salty for my preference.  The steak was a little tough but seasoned perfectly. The paella was amazing and it's a jumbo sized portion.  I'm so impressed at how great the food and service were on a day when all other places were closed or had limited menus.  Glad it's right around the corner.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Third visit here. Took my college son. We had everything I'd had before. We started with Oysters Rockefeller and Christmas Ales. He loved the stuffed quail on cream corn best. He really liked the mushroom ravioli with tiger shrimp. The Kobe sliders were great. Service was very good. Can't wait to visit again. A favorite."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Definitely a favorite of mine! Amazing cocktail menu and the ambiance is always perfect! Great food as well!"}
{"text":"Meh It was my husband birthday and I specifically chose the location because of the menu they had online. My husband loves Bronzino and online it was an entree. We got there to a totally different menu. There were only one fish option and it was Salmon. The tapas were better than the entrees. We liked the salmon flatbread and the sardines were very good.  I told the waiter three times that we were there for a birthday. He brought the check before we could order desert and when he brought desert he still couldn't put a candle in it. The irony is that they put candles on two other tables desert. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Tapas Tuesdays where ALL the Tapas are 50% off; surprisingly the restaurant was pretty empty. The decor and the atmosphere were very nice, loved the music, and the service from our waiter Mike was excellent! This was my first time so I wanted to take advantage of the special. The shrimp lobster bisque was descent; it would've been nice if it had pieces of shrimp and lobster in the soup. The lobster nachos were ok; the guacamole over powered the other flavors. The lobster Mac n cheese was not what I expected; it was a little to rich for my palate and the combination of cheeses too strong. The lollipop lamb chops were good (medium), but the potatoes they were served on tasted like box mashed potatoes. I ordered a Peach Bellini Martini; no complaints at all. All and all, it is a nice establishment but in my opinion, it would be a great place to go as a lounge and have drinks because the atmosphere is dead on for that. The food was just ok, but the over all experience was nice hence 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food is so good and I love the ambiance! I love their lobster bisque and lobster Mac and cheese. I look forward to the return of lobster to the menu! Also had the lamb lollipop and thought they were quite good with delicious mashed potatoes on the side. The sea food curry pasta was to die for... absolutely yummy and the sauce was perfectly done. The wine menu was extensive and descriptive. Particularly like the drinks here. The service was very good, even remembered my friend's drink of choice from a previous visit.  Only small complaint is that the patio was disturbed By loud music playing from a van in the ally way as well as the smell of garbage at one point which drove us inside. Both are not an issue with Bodega and they attempted to rectify the situation personally."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious, and they stay open really late with a full menu. It's a very trendy restaurant, and all the wait staff are more than helpful. They serve bread with dipping oil for while you wait for your food, the bread alone is as good as a full course meal."}
{"text":"I've only had drinks here, so if you're looking for a food review, you should skip my review...so you can finish reading the rest of the reviews and head right out to Bodega!   We went here for drinks one night after a friend's art opening on Coventry. When I went inside I was immediately blown away by the great music and trendy lighting\decor. We were seated on a couch in an area that was surrounded by curtains. The entire effect made the place into one of those hip places the girls on Sex and the City would go...I used to watch that show and think there was nothing like that in Cleveland! We went here again to celebrate some birthdays, and when I learned we were going here, I was excited all week long.  The drink menu is enormous to the point where I eventually gave up trying to find the \"perfect\" drink and simply ordered a James Bond martini (called the Vesper). If you can't find a drink on the menu that you'd like, you're probably just too picky.  I have been here twice, and the music has been amazing both times. Once, there was a live jazz band; they got major kudos when they played \"Careless Whisper\" after I requested it. The second time there was no band, but there was TECHNO playing! I don't think there was a live DJ, but it sounded just as good...the mix was fantastic for the entire time (I was there almost 2 hrs). The music can be a bit loud (some of the folks I was with thought it was incredibly loud) but it's soooooo good!  I'm excited to try the food here sometime--my mom was a Spanish teacher who traveled to both Spain and Mexico, and hopefully I can get her here sometime...just gotta see if there's a time when the music isn't blasting!  All in all, this is definitely an asset to Coventry. I love the sports bars much more, don't get me wrong, but during the dry season between the end of basketball and the beginning of football when there's nothing on...this makes a fantastic place to grab a few drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow. But warmed up a little. Started with a stout from England. Very smooth and tasty. Then split the happy hour tapa's with a friend: Pomme frittes w truffle oil, cevice, moule frittes, lobster mash, and kobe sliders. All very good and i would order again. Trendy scene, very cool place to hang out. I'll be back with the wifey soon. She would enjoy this place. Parking 50 cents per hour at the meter. Bring your quarters."}
{"text":"This place can easily be missed. I initially thought it was a fancy expensive place on Coventry but we had a coupon for it which made it opportune to try it. Walked in and felt like a baller! Super trendy with a very chic décor inside. There's a nice intimate section on the side of the restaurant with lots of plush, comfortable couches with decorative pillows in a Moroccan theme.  As for food, we got a seafood medley in a tomato broth, not quite a cioppano but this was on the Moroccan menu (sorry forgot the name). I wanted to throw my classy broad card out the window and just drink straight from the bowl. Had a little spice which I love. Great to dip some bread in and sop up all the last few drops. Also got a lemon chicken which was laden with salt and some surprisingly large potato chunks. It was a good sized portion, loved it at first but the salt and potatoes turned me off after a while.  Bathrooms were very clean. I believe Wednesday is ladies night (half off wine along with other specials which I failed to hear). Parking either on streets (meter) or across street in lot (more meters)."}
