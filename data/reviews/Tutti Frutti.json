{"text":"Everything is just okay. Nothing surprise me or let me down. Probably, next time, I will try the fruit plates. Crêpe is too sweet."}
{"text":"The service was okay but the served portion was rather small. The potatoes were a bit too salty in my opinion and the plate looked kinda empty. However, the chocolate strawberry crepe I ordered tasted good. I haven't been to a lot of brunch places but I would recommend \"Allo mon coco\" over Tutti Frutti despite its pricier menu because the food portion and quality you get there is more worth the price."}
{"text":"Starving after visiting the Notre Dame Basilica, we stumbled upon this restaurant nearby. Wish we would have continued walking just a bit further to all of the lovely restaurants to choose from a few blocks away. Rookie mistake. The food here was edible, but not good. The service was atrocious even though it was not crowded - long time to order, long time to get food, food delivered and no silverware, long time to pay. Would never return."}
{"text":"I will never return!  Poor service, rude.  Shoddy food, and they RAN OUT OF COFFEE.  How does that happen at a breakfast place?"}
{"text":"Breakfast was terrible beyond terrible.  1/3 of fruit on the Groumand dish and my wife received the other 1/3 of it.   The other tutti fruitti provide a full slice of each fruit.   The toast was beyond cold, the coffee tasted burnt and the bacon tasted and felt that it was microwaved twice.   Don't eat here just walk a little further and enjoy somewhere else."}
{"text":"A great little breakfast place in the vein of Cora.  The menu offers a huge variety of classic breakfast staples, ranging from waffles to crepes to omelettes to Benedicts.  They all seem to come with a generous helping of fresh fruit, and the prices are quite affordable.  Tasty food, well prepared.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"less than average breakfast joint .
If they don't have fresh orange juice , they shouldn't be calling it tutti frutti.
never again"}
{"text":"I really recommend coming here, not only do they great tasting treats but the building itself is colorful and fun!!."}
{"text":"We did not like the potatoes that came with the breakfast. The service was very slow. We came on a Saturday morning (July 22) and it took a long time to get water, our food and the bills. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever.  If it looks busy inside then don't go in.

After being seated, it took 15 minutes just to order a coffee and a strawberry banana smoothie, with both that never came.  

At the 30 minute mark, I went up to the front desk to request service.  The manager came to take our orders.  So we reordered this time including the food as well.  The manager said it's not possible to have a strawberry banana smoothie, it's not available. So we ordered a mango smoothie.

Another 10 minutes passed, finally coffee arrived. A few minutes later the mango smoothie arrived.

About 20 minutes later, still no food but a strawberry banana smoothie arrived, which we sent back.

Food finally arrived 10 minutes later.

Fried Potatoes were soggy, toast was stale.  Had to get cream and ketchup from an adjacent table.  My fried bacon was also soggy and very greasy.

My potatoes were way too salty.  My girlfriend's omelet had a big piece of eggshell in it which she bit into by accident.

Tables around us were all experiencing the same crappy service.  People demanding their bills.

I didn't finish half my food and the manager came with our bill and the visa machine. 

This is my first ever review.  I need to warn you people.  There is another breakfast place down the street.  Go there instead."}
{"text":"I placed an order through Uber Eats and optioned an extra $1.50 for beans.  Once I received my order (order total came up to $32.78) my beans were missing and there were no fruits.  Excuse me but your name is Tutti Frutti, should be named Tutti-NO-Frutti. Apart from that, I called the resto and got transferred to the Owner, ASAAD. I mentioned to him that I did not receive the beans.  He tried to push me off stating that Tutti Frutti did not get paid but I had to call Uber Eats. What?? You're telling me that you do not charge your clients for the food you provide??? All I wanted was to get a credit since I was charged an extra $1.50 but ASSAD here completely rude and unprofessional hung up on me! Well ASSAD, lesson learned.  For $1.50, people will know what kind of owner/manager Tutti Frutti has on St Jean. Next time, treat your customers with respect no matter how much the price is."}

{"text":"I used to go here often back in the day in 2008 and it was pretty good. I went there two weeks ago and has the most horrifying experience. 
I ordered the salmon bagel plate. 

I was happily eating my bananas, I went to grab my bagel to close it up (because it comes as an open face serving with the cream cheese on one side and the salmon with capers on the other). THANK GOD IT WAS OPEN! I saw a dark short hair on my salmon. I was immediately grossed out and called the waitress over. She brought the plate back to the kitchen and my friends and I just starred at them to make sure this would be made new. Instead they called over the other waitresses to look at the plate, then they called over kitchen staffed, then the chefs, pretty soon the whole staff of Westmount Tutti Fruitti was looking over my haired plate with surprised faces. 

The chef made a new bagel. The waitress brought over my plate with the new bagel and THE SAME Fruit... the same original plate that the nasty hair was found on. And I knew this because my half eaten bananas were still there... 

I'm not being a diva but if there was a hair on that plate, I can not bring my self to want to touch anything on that plate. So I was very upset to see that A. The same plate was returned to me rather than the staff throwing the food out and starting with a fresh new plate. And B. the manager didn't even bother to apologize for this gross mishap. 

I didn't touch anything on the plate and all the food was left untouched. The waitress asked if we wanted the bill and saw my plate was FULL still and brought my bill. I noticed the plate was charged in FULL. And I asked why this was seeing as to how I couldn't even stomach one bite. She responded with \" Well, the chef made you a whole new bagel so we have to charge full price.\" 
I replied, \"I didn't touch my new bagel or any food because you brought me the original plate where I found the hair. 
She left to speak to a manager and came back with the negotiate solution of \"half price\".
I declined because why would I pay for food I didn't eat. I came to eat breakfast starving... and now I've been traumatized by the hair. The waitress went back to the manager and they removed the plate from my bill. 

Tutti Fruitti has always been my favorite for breakfast and this experience has nothing to do with the chain at all but with the service and experience I had at this particular location. I still go to the chain here in Edmonton and they are above and beyond amazing with their food and service.  But I know that next time I come home to Montreal, I WILL NOT be going to Tutti Fruitti in Westmount... GROSS."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was not good at all, I hate throwing away food but my friends and I all didn't enjoy our 3 different meals"}
{"text":"Si il y a une note en bas de 0 ... Je l'applique pour ce resto!! Pas de bacon dans le club déjeuner de mon mari! Je demande une crêpe \" érablière \" au fruit la jeune serveuse sans aucune expérience visiblement, m'apporte une crêpe avec bacon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Everytime we visit Old Montréal my family has to have breakfast here. My daughter loves the crêpes, super huge and tons of fresh fruit.  My son cannot get enough waffles, nutella, and bananas.  Super strong coffee my husband and I and our breakfasts were superb.  Everything is tasty, fresh, and made to order.  Plus, our server was excellent."}
{"text":"First the good news, there were plenty of newspapers to read.

Now that I got that out of the way, let's have a look at why I gave it one star; it would have been zero, if that had been an option.

My wife and I ordered the exact same thing, the Tom & Jerry breakfast (2 eggs, 4 strips of bacon, 4 sausages, and choice of toast). I'll chalk the one star up to the eggs having been cooked correctly (mine over-easy, my wife scrambled). However, it was clear that the time between us placing our order and how long it took for the plates to be placed in front of us that the bacon and sausage had either been cooked hours earlier and were reheated or were microwaved in the time it took for the eggs to cook.

The bacon and the sausages were so oily and were clearly just sitting in their own oils while waiting to be ordered. They were lukewarm at best. I don't mind if my bacon is not crispy, but there was nothing crispy about this bacon. The \"cooked\" sausage looked exactly like it had come out of the wrapper and was barely warm, but  for what its worth, it was cooked. The toast must have had half a pound of butter on it. The butter was literally oozing out of the bread, that I was worried if I ate it, my arteries would clog up within seconds.

I understand that the \"chef\"  may want to get ahead of any potential rush, but come on, cooking eggs, bacon, and sausages does not take that long. On top of that there were only two other tables being used (Wednesday morning at 8:30am).  When I went up to pay, I looked over at the grill and sure enough, the bacon and sausages were lined up side by side, sitting in their grease, and ready to be re-heated.

I have been to other breakfast places and even a Tutti Fruitti in Chateauguay and this place was by far the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. Not only would I recommend not going to this restaurant, I would recommend skipping a meal before I would even think of going in here."}
{"text":"How fun! I guess I've been living under a rock cause I didn't know these serve yourself, buffet o'toppings, froyo places existed. 

Well it is our new favorite treat place to take our children. 

Great flavors of frozen yogurt. \"Not as sour\" as other frozen yogurt my 12 yr old commented.  They had a sugar free chocolate flavor, which was delicious. 

The buffet of toppings is super fun.  Everything from Boba to fruit and typical candy toppings. 

We have 5 children and we usually spend under $25!!! Which is an excellent price. That's a lot of dessert we are buying.  

Go!"}
{"text":"This place looked so good...funk name...we decided to try it on out last day in Montreal...Big disappointment! First of all they didn't serve half of food on the menu for the reason that I didn't even understood...I think just because...
Secondly, the food was horrible. I ordered baked beans with sausage and fried potatoes. what I got was overcooked can of beans with something looked like sausage.. tasted horrible...
I will never go back..."}
{"text":"Les brunch qu'ils servent ne sont pas à mettre à la poubelle ce qui signifie que les plats sont assez bons. Cependant, il n'y a rien d'exceptionnel et il existe des places pour déguster de bien plus mémorables brunchs.
Parfois, pour certains restaurants, on ne ressent pas qu'il s'agit d'une chaîne. Or, là... on le ressent grandement dans le service, dans la manière dont c'est gérer, etc.
Il y a de bien meilleures places pour profiter d'une bonne matinée de brunch."}
{"text":"I don't like to bad mouthing restaurants but,  I  have never in my life been to a restaurant where people were sleeping while waiting for food.  Our meal took an hour and 20 minutes  before  it arrived.  According to our waitress there was only one cook in the kitchen.  Based on my experience my advice is to avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't even know where to begin with how awesome this place is! 

From the outside it doesn't seem like much,but once inside the face that it's so large while still giving off a comfy feel is already impressive. 

As we stood and waited to be seated we noticed how amazing the food that was being served looked, so we were excited to sit down. Our waitress was the epitome of great. She made suggestions, checked on us often, and made small talk. 

The fact that there is an English version of the menu was such a relief! As we looked at the pictures in the menu we wanted to order everything! We settled on the bagel with cream cheese, lox, tomato, onion and capers served with fresh fruit. If you think they just made the food look fancy in the menu you've got another thing coming b/c it is just as impressive in person! The fruit was carved into cool patterns and there was an orchid on the plate! I had to take a picture. I was hoping that the taste would live up to the beauty and boy did it! Everything was deeelicious! We were told that even the type of orchid they use is edible! 

This place made me wish I lived in Montreal, so I could come more often!"}
{"text":"We were pleased to find that Tutti Frutti in the Vieux Port was not at all busy on Valentine's Day at noon ... I guess everybody else brunched earlier than we did, or was scared away by the cold. 

Everyone in our group of four adults had a generous breakfast for about $15 (plus tax and tip), which is on par with other breakfast chains like Chez Cora or Eggspectations. The food was better than Chez Cora (I haven't tried Eggspectations). The vegetarians in our group were impressed by the number of veggie options, especially in the eggs benedict part of the menu. 

My blueberry pancakes were crèpes instead of American-style pancakes (yay!) and real maple syrup costs extra. The bacon was a bit funny (other reviewers have mentioned that it's like the pre-cooked kind you can get at the supermarket), My hubby was disappointed that he had to choose either the mountain of fruit or a meat option and not both. I was disappointed (but not surprised) to find that there were no non-dairy options (e.g. soy milk) for coffee. Service was so-so but the food came out hot and that's the most important thing for me on a day that's below -20 C!"}

{"text":"I see a lot of negative reviews given to this place. But we really liked it. Excellent place for breakfast! Delicious food, freshly squeezed juices, and very good service! They took a bit longer than expected to bring the food, but then again, the place is in a very busy area of Old Montreal, right next door to Notre Dame Basilica. So I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am changing my previous review from last year (3 stars) to 1 star. 
Today I had a quiche with a soup, salad, potatoes, and coffee. It was my 2nd choice because they were out ingredients for my 1st choice. The vegetable soup was greasy. The coffee was less than ordinary. The quiche was burnt on top. (See picture.) The potatoes were too salty. The salad dressing was too sweet. The only food item that was OK was my glass of water. Service was OK, not great. With the many other (and better) restaurants around, I am not planning to go back."}

Breakfast.  Wasn't in the least impressed with the food.  Ordered a tuna club it was God awful.  There was just something about the taste of the tuna that wasn't right. Tuna club isn't on the menu - \"club\" is can't remember which one.  Beef barley was the soup of the day that came with the meal....couldn't eat way too salty.  The only thing appetizing about my meal were the homefries. One friend ordered the chocolate banana berry crepe which hands down was the best meal of the group.  Other friend ordered quiche and said it was just ok.  We agreed we wouldn't go back.  Waitress was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

Thanks to another WagJag deal my husband and I went there twice.

On our first visit we had the \"Three-egg Feta Omelette With fresh fruit\" and the \"Blue Velvet\" (= \"Two eggs, bacon with delicious blueberry crepes\").

\"Blue Velvet\" looked better than it tasted.

The lettuce had brown spots
The crepes were oily and the blueberries sour & overpowering

The omelet on the other hand was good and it came with two sides of buttered toast which we appreciated.

The service was kind of slow although the place was 3/4 empty at 1 pm.
But they also had only one waitress...


On our second visit we ordered \"Steak and Eggs\" which came with two slices of toast and home fries.
The steak was on the smaller side, but made up for it with tenderness and taste. The rest was also very enjoyable.

This time the service was pretty fast, but we were the only patrons inside so that can be expected.


Overall my experience at Tutti Frutti was OK, but I know I won't be back. The restaurant is just not really my thing.."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here and I'm so impressed with the general quality of this chain-resto and the service that really goes above and beyond.

This place is a few months new- franchised restaurant.  I'm not a chain person- but this particular location (although I've never been to any other location) went above and beyond to make my experience spectacular.

highlights-
-the service- the servers genuinely enjoy working there and they are just smiley people- 100% attentive and awesome
-the manager- seems to really care that everything runs smoothly and everyone's happy : )
-the food- the portions are MASSIVE.  I had the smoked salmon eggs benny and it was done well except giant sized.  These sliced potatoes were not the average hash browns but they were surprisingly seasoned nicely and tasty
-the bonus that everything comes with a heaping portion of fresh fruit- sweet and in season- unlike cora's or eggspectations (which are examples of chains I kind of hate)

Even though it's in a food court setting it IS a restaurant with sit-down service.  I had no idea!
They also have a patio that's nice to sit on and do some Bay street people watching.

Prices are standard for the area 10-15$/ entree BUT they have early bird specials that I will definitely come in for just because I AM up that early and it's in the 'hood.

This place will almost definitely replace my other fave cheap breaky in the area- sunshine diner on adelaide/front."}
{"text":"Kind of felt like walking through a portal back to America. Mostly English, huge portions, fruit tasted preserved. There are better options around."}
{"text":"I come here just for the fruit plates. Absolutely delicious! Oh and the coffee is AWESOME too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the smoke salmon bagel and it literally just came with 3 salmon slices. It's a 16$+ plate and it was definitely not worth the high price! Good fresh fruit though."}
{"text":"We highly recommend this place if you enjoy great food, clean atmosphere, value for the money, and awesome hospitality. We enjoyed our experience so much that we came twice on our trip and everything consistent on both visits. We split the Gourmet meal along with there fruit crepes meal so we could try everything. The portions are very generous as well xv adding to the value part I mentioned above."}
{"text":"Our group arrived for breakfast. It took about 20 minutes to be served. The waitress plopped down the pot of coffee and walked off again. Not even asking if some of us wanted tea or juice instead.

She did eventually come back and take our orders. One of us at the our table ordered the French Toast. The picture looked good, and we've seen how it was served at Cora's, so it was a sure bet. 

The food arrived, and the French Toast was there. But that's about it. It was a slice of French toast, on a plate! You would think that a place called Tutti Futti would serve Fruit with their plates. Especially since they were charging $14 for it.

We brought this up to the waitress, and she told us that if we wanted fruit with our plate, we should have ordered it with the fruit for $1 more. She didn't offer to bring us the fruit or ask if we wanted to order the \"extra\". She treated us like WE were wrong, and then walked away.

After eating, it took another 20 minutes to get our bill, but only after we physically got up to the register and ask for it. 

Needless to say, she did not receive a tip for this meal, and we have no intention on returning again. (We go to Eggs Oeufs now, and it's amazing!)"}
{"text":"Interior is just as nice as DFM's location. Can't complain about service since you serve yourself. The only thing is that they seemed to have less topping options than the DFM's location, but no biggie!"}
{"text":"Average food, rock bottom service. In town for vacation and spent 1.5 hours of my day stuck in this place because the wait staff were so terrible. Waited over a half hour to get my check and then even longer to pay after that."}
{"text":"My cousins and I ate here.The breakfast here is mediocre. I realized that Canadians cook their omelettes different than Americans. Even the hash browns were different. But I do like the fact the fact that the serve fruits with their eggs. Also you get half off if its your birthday."}
{"text":"The chocalte bana crepe was great!"}
{"text":"Super convenient location by the metro. Run-of-the-mill breakfast joint (similar to a Cora's or Eggsmart). Crepes are thicker than they are supposed to be... so they are more like pancakes, in my opinion. Decent service though when I went twice."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here while on vacation last year in Montreal.  The food is nothing special.  It all seemed relatively fresh but, could have been fresher.  Their menu items are similar to Cora and iHop, offering breakfast and lunch options.  It's better than iHop but, far worse than Cora or Eggspectations.

The only reason I gave this review two stars instead of one is because, the food was decent.  The service was absolutely horrible.  Our server was nice, but barely came by.  We saw her maybe four times during our entire visit.  I was a server myself for years, so I am defiantly in a position to critique other server's service.  The entire place was dead, maybe 5 tables including us with at least three servers.  There were dirty dishes all over tables near us and they were not getting cleaned, most of the tables were dirty our entire visit.  Not very enjoyable to be sitting in a restaurant surrounded by tables full of dirty dishes.  Our server took way too long to initially introduce herself and offer us drinks.  We had to wait almost ten minutes, and keep in mind it was dead!  I didn't even see her running around dealing with other tables, guessing she was just in the back?  Maybe taking a smoke break?  She took too long to bring us our drinks considering we just ordered waters.  Our food also took forever and the kitchen seemed very unorganized.  The cooks also didn't seem like they were in good hygiene to be cooking, I didn't see hair nets with cooks with longer hair for one thing.  Our server did not check back with us until we were finished our meal!  And we are not fast eaters.  When I was a server I was always taught the two bits rule, keep an eye on them, once they are two bites, in check back.  That way if there is something wrong, they don't have to sit there for a long time, getting hungrier with a plate of food they can't eat.  I understand when it's busy, the two bite rule is hard, but there were about five tables and at least three servers.  Even if for some reason she didn't have time for a check back, she should have gotten another server to do it.  When she came to check back, we requested the check which also took a long time.  She was fairly nice (especially at the end), but I was server for years and I know the trick she was trying to pull, but unfortunately being nice for the short times you are there and extra nice at the end while you are an absent server, and being lazy does not work.

After writing this review, I'm realizing everything that was wrong with this place.  It was very depressing in there too.  I am changing it to a one star.  If the food was good, I would make it two stars but, the service... sorry I was a server so I have higher expectations.  My mom has never even worked as a server and said it was some of the worst service she's had.  Being nice does not make up for being lazy.  I would suggest going to Cora or Eggspectations!  They are both amazing!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the World Cup. I feel like the city didn't prepare for the massive amount of people that would be coming in. (Like with this restaurant only having one cook the day of the game)

That being said, im surprised that Tutti Fruitti doesn't have massive amounts of amazing reviews. Yes, we waited about an hour for our food. On a normal day, I don't think that would be the case. Even so, it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT! The food was amazing. By far our favorite breakfast place we visited on our trip! We had the tutti frutti special, the black magic crepes and the banana and Nutella waffle and the fresh squeezed orange juice was wonderful! The waitress was so pleasant and apologetic for the slow service but made sure we were taken care of. We will make sure we go back every time we are in town!"}

Les serveurs ne sont pas souriants et l'ont a l'impression de les déranger lorsque nous osons demander quelques choses.

Vraiment dommage !"}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss depending on what you ordered. The fiance ordered some maple syrup crepe that tasted horrible. However, I ordered the raspberry crisp. It's this AMAZING crispy french toast with crumbs on the outside. OMG trust me.. it's just the best thing you'll ever taste. No joke. GO THERE AND ORDER IT!! I should have taken a picture but I seriously was too busy devouring this freaking amazing dish. It's super light and fluffy yet crispy on the outside. Ummmm Their coffee and bagels are meh."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not special. The variety could be more and they should also offer pancakes. They don't have. 
The main problem is the bad service. It was so busy but there weren't many employees so we have waited for so long for the food. The waitress didn't bring water and she also brought the coffee after 30 minutes. After the food came and she made a mistake. She mixed up things and didn't even say sorry. Also the tea was cold and not hot. For sure I won't go again."}

{"text":"Great little diner-vibe place!

The reviews for this place are mixed and I think we have to disagree with some of the negative ones.

The food was great! We both had crepes from the sweet category and they came out very nice. The custard filling was delicious but we do have to agree that overall they are too sweet. Her maple crepes were so sweet the sauce was gritty with sugar. Mine had excellent flavor but they were just too sweet to eat all of even if you're very hungry.

The service was great and the coffee hit the spot!

We diddnt know this was a chain place when we went in and we wouldn't have guess it after eating there! Definately worth a try and we both would go back to try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The potatoes tasted like they were soaked in oil from the night before. The service was bad. And the staff were smoking in the parking lot
There are far (far!!) Superior places for breakfast within walking distance of this place.
Do not go here"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Not sure why such low ratings. Randomly found this place and the food and service was great. The freshly made fruit drinks were very tasty. I ordered the black magic, thought I would receive it in form of a crepe but instead it was like chocolate chip pancakes. Still very delicious. My boyfriend had the chocolate hazelnut crepe with strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries- soooooo good! Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 10:30 table wasnt ready until 10:50, we had to wait over 1 hour for the food, had to get up twice for coffee...staff was rude as hell. Worst service. Going to Allo Mon Coco next time."}
{"text":"Wow!! I can't believe all the different toppings that you can put on your yogurt. Just a word from first hand experience, don't fill your cup up more than 2/3 with yogurt or you won't have any room for the good stuff ;) We really enjoyed our dessert here and the selection of yogurt & toppings was second to none."}
{"text":"I ordered the Banana Nutella Crepe. It was super delicious.The whip cream was fluffy and the bananas were not completely mushy!  The Crepe had chocolate drizzled on top. The Bananas we're covered in Nutella! When we took our seat we were seated in a booth of 6. We were a group of 4. Overall a WONDERFUL breakfast."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. Everything you need don't forget the French toast with strawberries."}
{"text":"Tried it on UberEATS, moist is the word most appropriate to describe the food. It was kind of expected because breakfast is good on the spot but I gave them a chance anyway.

The two stars are because it was decently fast."}
{"text":"I've been to a few brunch places, and went here for lunch with my sister.

The decor is a bit cheesy-cheap (bad yellowish lighting and cartoonish colors/photos), so you'd expect the prices to be as such, but they're a bit pricier than they should be.

I will agree that the quantities are copious. However when you factor in the grocery-store-like quality of the meals, the menu items could be at least $4-$5 cheaper than they are.

The service was meh. I didn't care much for the lack of up-sell. If I ask for hot chocolate instead of coffee (which comes with my meal option) instead of saying \"No you can't...\" say \"sure, at an extra fee\" or \"may I recommend tea or milk instead?\" The service, much like the decor, conveyed affordability over quality (which again, the prices did not lol).

I also appreciate being left alone after I'm done eating not being rushed out, but to not check up, or walk past the table for over 20 mins is a bit much. I don't enjoy having to go find someone to pay for my meal. I'm not going to beg, \"please take my money.\" If I don't see my waitress, I usually walk out (luckily only happened once in my life).

Overall, decent in a pickle, I prefer Universel for the atmosphere, but food quality vs quantity... it matches Eggspectations in my book."}
{"text":"C'est une bonne place à déjeuner si vous aimez le traditionnel deux oeufs bacon! L'assiette vous coûtera peu cher et vous serez comblé! Toutefois, si vous voulez manger qq chose de plus exotique/ hors de l'ordinaire, je vous conseille d'aller ailleurs ! Les assiettes moins basiques sont chères et peu goûteuses à mes goûts !"}
{"text":"I dont like tutti Frutti that much. It doesnt have the same quality as Cora or Eggquis. I will give  points for the service, the waitress was great. 

Overall, I think it could be better.... the food menu isnt so bad to pick but the food tastes pretty bland for me. The one I pick has too many carbs which unbalance the whole dish. Pancake, potatoes and breads serves with sunny side eggs and bacons. Something was missing... fruits, maybe?"}
{"text":"I went today for breakfast with 3 other person. The service was long despite it not being too busy. The menus where inconsistent, one out of 4 of our menus didn't have the same pricing (of course we ended up paying for the most expensive one)

We never got refills on our coffee nor water. The food wasn't really enjoyable, the fruits didn't seem fresh. Two people sit next to us, waited for service and ended up leaving while we where there. 

We used to love this place but I think it's our last time."}
{"text":"This place serves breakfast and lunch and the menu consists primarily of crepes, omelettes and fruit bowls.  It's located conveniently right outside Notre Dame and is reasonably priced.  

The crepes here were gigantic and a bit thick (more like a pancake really).  Portions were incredibly large, I'm not sure how one person can finish.  Egg dishes ran on the small side but they give plenty of potatoes and toast to fill you up if you're so inclined.  Food itself was just so-so and service suffered primarily due to the fact that they only had one waitress on a Tuesday morning (which I assume is not a busy day).  She was very pleasant and attentive when she wasn't  dealing with the other 5 tables.  Not a bad choice if you want a quick bite in the area but there are probably better choices a few blocks away."}
{"text":"It's not a 1* it more like a 3.5*. It's not a the best breakfast in town but for two ppl & $17.00 in tip. It's decent for a fast on-the-go breakfast. Go. You would be thrilled but you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"I have to say this is probably going to be one of the most memorable moments on my vacation to Montreal. I went twice because I fell in love with four things, the first thing is the banana hazelnut crêpe(I got it twice and it never failed to satisfy me yet leave me enough for later), the second reason was because of the gluten free crepes they had which allowed my mother to eat there as well, the third reason is because of the wonderful hospitality from the waitresses who were happy to explain the culture and language surrounding us, and the 4th and final reason is because of a wonderful, pretty, and very interesting waitress who was unfortunately married but none the less was quite nice and awesome. I would highly suggest going here on a trip to Montreal(I would also suggest getting the hot chocolate)! It's sad to see a beauty of a restaurant be put down so heavily in the ratings, I hope those who have rated it badly come to see the good parts of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Tutti Frutti. I always feel like their food is just so damn oily and stale but considering the fact that I was lazy and didn't feel like driving around to find another brunch place, I stopped here with a girlfriend of mine. 

We were seated fairly quickly. Our waitress was extremely nice and very quick. I opted to for the \"Waist Watcher\" which includes a poached egg, cottage cheese and a heaping pile of fruits and you know what?? I was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice fresh plate, the fruits were crunchy but tasty, not high in fat, high in protein.

Would I go out of my way to come back? No. Would I eat here again and order the same thing? Yup!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not like other breakfast places. The service was quick but the food was not good. It had an off taste. I had le gourmet. Pancakes, ham, beans, bacon, sausages and eggs. The pancakes were not fresh and the taste was as if it was defrosted before being put on the plate. Eggs and sausages were ok. Bacon was burnt. We were also handed the check while we were still eating. That was the big turnoff."}
{"text":"This is meant as a 3 &1/2 stars
This chain has always been, for me, exactly what it is, a chain restaurant. There is something about chain restaurants that is so generic that it is hard to be attracted to (with a few exceptions of course)

I have been to other Tutti Frutti few other times in my lifetime (lol!) but this one was a first. Thought I'd finally leave a rating now that Im such a Yelper :P

The staff here is nice & very attentive.
The food, generic. It wasn't bad nor was it great. It was okay for too-lazy-to-make-breakfast-this-morning. We got the combos as you will see with the pictures, I asked for the Nutella on the side and I think there was enough to feed a small family with that... LOL!!! 

I would go back if I was too lazy to make breakfast again on a weekend and this wasn't too far away on my path."}
{"text":"Came in around 11:30am, and waited to be seated for 25min. Not that we were told there was a wait, but were ignored. Finally got seated, waited 30min for water and coffee. We didn't get our food for 40min and the waiters were extremely inattentive and rude. Perhaps they were understaffed, but still. The food was average. I'd recommend going to Eggspectation right down the street. Much better"}
{"text":"Went there as it was the only place nearby that was still open. They were on a skeleton crew on the holiday so half of the stuff we could not even order. Asked for a chocolate milk and it had gone bad 2 weeks ago. Since I returned it and didn't want milk anymore I asked for a cola and they charged me for both drinks even knowing what happened. 
The fruit was good. That is about it. Everything else was bad. The crepes were watered down. the syrup tasted awful. The beans came from a can. The has browns were burnt. Should have kept this place closed if it was going to be that bad."}
{"text":"If I get could give -7 stars I would.  By far the worst dining experience I've had.  They advertise soup and coffee included in your meal and they decided not to make soup that day.  We asked for tea, never got it.  3/4 had water which took way too long.

Next, I ordered a chicken crepe and an asparagus crepe was brought to me.  I asked the waitress for my correct crepe she rolled her eyes and was being argumentative about the crepe.   I asked for a manager and they claimed there was not one available.  Another server brought me a chicken crepe and then our waitress brought another chicken crepe and she again was arguing with me about why I had a crepe.  It was a mess.  The hamburgers are made with fake meat.

PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU HATE YOURSELF."}
{"text":"The food is meh but its fine if you just wanna go out for a quick, stale breakfast. I ordered the vegetarian omelette specifically because i dont eat meat, the waitress handed me my plate told me it was the vegetarian.  As i ate i realize i was eating ham! She had given me the wrong thing, i gave it back said i didnt want anything else and still got CHARGED ME FOR IT. If the food was good, i'd look overthat mistake. But there was nothing good about that experience."}
{"text":"The all you can eat pancakes for 10$ wasn't worth it at all. I probably could've made better pancakes at home."}
{"text":"Service merdique .... Longue attente 1h30 !!!!!!!!!...table à moitié monté... Bouffe froide..."}
{"text":"En passant du salée ou sucrée, il y en a pour tous les goûts pour l'heure du brunch. On sort d'ici avec le ventre bien plein, ou tout y est bien bon."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the reviews about the bad smell are? They seemed to be from quite a while ago, so things have changed I'm guessing because I just had some today and no smell that I noticed?

On to the froyo! Yummm! I got milk tea and cotton candy mix and wow Soo good! Not too sweet which is what usually turns me off from froyo or ice cream. I topped mine with a bunch of mochi and it was perfection!

I got my dad a coconut froyo topped with all the fruits in the topping section and he ate every single bite!

It was an awesome little afternoon treat!
I liked it a lot! Also, if you didn't know, they have soy options as well, which is incredible for vegans! Yay"}
{"text":"Loved our meals at Tutti Frutti so much when we visited Old Montreal that we made sure to go back again before our vacation ended.  Best crepes and French toast we've ever tasted! Service was friendly and our server even remembered us when we returned. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"American breakfast, nothing particularly special. The atmosphere and decor were mediocre"}
{"text":"Deux visite.

La première fois, un dîner du samedi. Presque personne dans le resto à l'heure du midi, Quand même bizarre. Je me rend compte à la fin que je n'ai jamais reçu mes fèves au lards avec mon repas. Le service était lent.

Menu avec plusieurs options comme la majorité des place de déjeuner.

Deuxième visite, un vendredi d'une fin de semaine de trois jours. Prends la même chose que la dernières fois, assiettes gourmand. Bien remplis, mais plusieurs chose comment les fèves au lard goûte pas beaucoup, Comme trop bouillit. Dommage.

Spéciaux 10$ crêpe à volonté la semaine.

Rabais de 10% avec la carte caa."}
{"text":"restaurant de déjeuner comme les autres,  Rien de spécial.  plusieurs types d'assiette de déjeuner typique mais pas bon. 

j'ai pris l'assiette oeuf,  bacon,  jambon,  saucisse et crêpe. j'avais en plus des fèves au lard,  patate et rôties. 

pas mal toute goutais l'eau. les fèves au lard était liquide, les patates blême,  les oeufs petit et toute les viandes était gorgé  d'eau et sans goût. Ma crêpe était mince et très sec.  tellement qu'elle était croustillante comme une chip. J'ai jamais vu une crêpe comme ça  et ce n'est pas bon. 

les étudiants et employé de la place dupuis  on 15% de rabais. Mais même à ça, Je n'irai pas la.  j'y suis allez deux fois,  la fois d'avant plusieurs années avant et ce n'étais pas mieux. J'ai voulu leur donner une autre chance mais pas une troisième"}
{"text":"The first brunch place my boyfriend and I wandered in in Montreal. We were walking past and was extremely hungry and saw the great semi-outdoor seating and decided to come in after checking the menu. Alas, we were seated in the back much to our dismay, but our server quickly came over and introduced herself. Throughout the meal, we had exceptional service. My boyfriend ordered an omelette. It was a big serving and he liked it a lot.. I had the eggs benedict and it was very delicious. The fresh fruit that came with the dishes were great as well. To top that off, I had the latte which was very good. My boyfriend had the fresh squeezed orange juice and he absolutely loved it. Overall, solid place. Will come back if we had more time in Montreal."}
