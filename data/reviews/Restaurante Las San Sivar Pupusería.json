{"text":"So happy to have found this place. We had pupusas, tamales and plantain and it was all excellent. The owners are very friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to place thanks to yelp. This is one of the best Pupusas place I ever went to eat, in Toronto. I order just cheese and pork and cheese. Both had a good balance between corn tortilla and cheese and pork.The only down side was that their hot sauce was not hot enough for me."}
{"text":"Delicious, homey, cheap and authentic Salvadorian food! It was absolutely delicious and the service was very friendly and great. It was also packed when we came in - always a good sign. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"good value, 3 large chicken or beef tacos for $12. not fancy but lots of meat and very filling. pupusas have a lot of cheese, less bean than other places. friendly staff.dm"}
{"text":"My new fave spot for papusas.  So happy they opened up so close to me.  My wife is Salvadoran and she approves as well.  The sopa de res (hearty beef soup) is also on point.  Good value and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great add to the neighbourhood with fresh pupusas ! Bus stop located right outside and parking can be found across the street near Walmart. Our service was very friendly and attentive, would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"TIP:  Park at the Walmart...across the street.  Otherwise there is limited street parking here and keep in mind there is a bus stop that runs right beside this place, so that even further limits the parking.  A solid 3.5-4*, DEFINITELY better than another pupuseria in Kitchener that I went to recently.  Pretty authentic, as I did not see a single gringo here.  All the patrons seem to be Spanish-speaking.  The waitress' English was a bit rough, so that gives me an indication of authenticity.  Tamales are PRETTY BIG.  I wasn't that hungry, so initially, I was gonna share a chicken tamale.  However, the waitress said it was small-medium and indicated more on the small-side with her hands.  It was MORE than enough alone...as a complete meal imho!  I found the tamales more on the \"wet\" side.  Cheese was salty.  I think I still prefer Mexican tamales, but these were pretty good.    ***I must mention though that they arrived lukewarm.  Definitely not hot, so they needed to be nuked more!***  Pupusas are probably the star here.  If you're just a bit hungry, these are the perfect snack.  I think I just got a bit too stuffed from the tamale to actually enjoy their pupusas.  Splitting 2 pupusas + 1 tamale was a bit much for me.  So I'd make sure I was pretty hungry before coming here again.  Don't expect a balanced meal here though.  It's pretty carby, albeit cheap, so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"Pupusas sent from heaven! i didn't try any other food there but the pupusas are to die for. they are juicy, filled to the brim and the service is fairly quick. the only downside is they close at 21:00."}
