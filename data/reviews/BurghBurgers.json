{"text":"Some I'd the best burgers in the area.  Made fresh to order and you must get the loaded fries . . . AMAZING.
Also, you can get it delivered with UberEats!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this place along 51 because there are so few burger places in the South Hills, particularly fast casual rather than the expensive and slow sit-down burger restaurants. I have had excellent service each of the 3 times that I have gone so far. The fries are very good, they appear to be fresh cut and are seasoned well with seasoning salt. They use  high quality ingredients and I was told that they use never frozen beef that contains some steak to improve the flavor. The buns and toppings are excellent as well. Unfortunately, the beef patties are a bit on the rubbery/chewy side as if the beef is being overworked in the mixing and forming prior to cooking. Because of that it is hard to rate them higher than 3.5 stars but I decided to round up because of the good service and ingredients. If they fix the texture of the beef patties I will raise the score of my review. Overall they are doing many things well and I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"This place is always so neat, clean and inviting. I went there for my second time and the food was just as amazing as the first! The fries are great, everything is just so fresh and tasty! The serving sizes are plentiful and most definitely filling. The bread is so fresh and soft as ever. I've had both their grilled chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger in which neither time was I disappointed! The staff is very friendly. The peach milkshake I had was amazing to top off my great meal! If you want good quality food, I suggest giving this place a try! I know I will be back again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Nice little burger joint. We came here for the first time on a Sunday evening. We ordered the chicken cheese burger, double burger combo, and 2 pierogis. I thought it was a little pricy. $9.99 for a grilled chicken and burger patty (no fries or drink included), $1.99 for two pieces of pork bacon, ect. But we did like the flavors and were full after eating. The burger patties were smaller and thin but you could taste the seasonings and wasn't bland. The fries were fresh cut as well. We really liked the pierogis. We had potato and cheese and they were fried with butter. The workers were friendly as well."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to stop in this place since it opened and finally got the chance today.  Overall I was very happy with the experience, however I think there are some areas that could be improved.

First off, the workers are extremely friendly and helpful.  I chatted with them the entire time they prepared my food.  They explained the different menu options and also how all of their food is fresh.  A lot of places have good service but the workers here really seemed to go above in making sure I was happy with my meal.  

Now to the food.  I ordered a single cheeseburger with lettuce tomato and onion.  I also had a side of fries.  The fries were the first thing I ate and they were great.  You can tell they are housecut fries and it really made the difference.  They went perfect with the malt vinegar hey have on the tables.  As for the burger, it was very good for the type it is.  Do not expect a burgatory type thick burger, it is more like five guys style.  You could tell it was fresh and tasted very good.  I also thought the bun style was a good choice for the type of burger.

As I said there are a couple things I think they could change.  One, they have packaged ranch dressing rather than house made.  With how good their fries are, they need a good house made ranch.  Even people who don't eat ranch on their fries would want this for a topper on a chicken sandwich or even one of the burgers.  Another thing I noticed was the burger being smashed down while cooking.  Even though they are thinner burgers, the number one rule cooking burger is to never smash.  I think it would make for a much juicer burger if this rule was followed.

Overall I enjoyed my experience here and I look forward to going back and trying some other burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better! They made it very obvious that our personal preferences were extremely important to them. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The burger are very good.  The chicken sandwich was also good.  Fresh toppings.  Top it off with Penn State Creamery.  Excellent finish.   Stop in and give them a try.   You will be surprised.  Support a small business."}
{"text":"BurghBurgers is a tasty little joint if you are looking to grab a sandwich and some fresh cut fries!

The service here is excellent. Both the woman and gentlemen working (I think he is the owner) were super friendly and talked to us while making our food. She even went above and beyond and put my chicken sandwich in a separate bag then my husbands since he got burger and I had told her I do not eat beef. How nice! 

The fries are fresh cut and they have vinegar available to put on them which is my favorite! My chicken sandwich was cooked well and had a nice seasoning. I love that they have turkey bacon here! Also the buns- MMMMMM!! My only complaint is I do wish they had buffalo sauce and Home made ranch, this could make for a delicious chicken sandwich.

I cannot wait to go back and try their ice cream!! :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are great, the fries are good, but the milkshake is a joke at $7.50 (see attached picture). So get the burger and fries and stay away from the milkshakes."}
