{"text":"Blue Taj used to be good with great taste. I am back in Charlotte and my first buffet this time was in Blue Taj today but I was very disappointed with the food, servers and the billing process.  We arrived at 11:35 am (open time was 11:30 am) but door was still locked up. When knocked, one person opened and left as though we had forced him to welcome us. :) Food was not ready that time and they were still ordering their dishes.  About the food: mediocre food, nothing close to Indian for starters, main course (veg/non-veg). Goat curry was smelling bad, chicken had no taste and not very hard as though taken out from freezer and put in gravy. Desert (Rabri) was ok for consolation.  Servers: I had asked for some roti for my kids and they said they will bring if kid ask for it. Believe they know more than parent as what all each kids eat and when.  Billing process: I went to bill at the main counter and he charged for my 2 year old along with 7 year. when asked he said they charge for 3 year and older so I told them that my little one was 2 years. The person said that so what kid was eating  a piece of nan and some food in a plate. He said we have to clean the plate and it should be charged for that. I asked him so you are charging for washing an extra plate. He then removed the charge and said fine but we normally charge.  I said next time would be too much to be here. Better head to Peacock instead :) It was a big show off. The hospitality is bad and food was not authentic Indian at all. Last time here."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved here from Los Angeles and have missed all of the ethnic restaurants in the City of Angels.  Indian food is one of our favorites so finding The Blue Taj was quite a treat!  The food is amazing!  My husband tries something new each time and is never disappointed. I join him for an adventurous new appetizer on each vist but each time we go I order the Chicken Tikka Masala. It's unbelievably good!  Also, the naan at the Blue Taj is better than any naan I've ever had. If you love Indian food or have been looking to try it, I highly recommend The Blue Taj. The wait staff is super friendly and always very helpful with recommendations based on your tastes."}
{"text":"The noise and darkness scared me at the host stand. I'm glad I fought through the fear to sample this Indian deliciousness.  Chicken amritsara with vegetable samosa. Outstanding. The vegetables that came with the chicken were perfect.  Quick refills on the water, too."}
{"text":"Blue Taj is one of the best Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area.  I've been there at least half a dozen times and each experience has been great.  Their food is flavorful, fresh and very tasty, and their staff is attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  The interior is nice too - sophisticated and modern.  I will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"Great Indian Food! Came here with the family, some of which were a little hesitant about the spiciness and trying Indian food.  But i'm glad i talked them into coming.  All the things we ordered were flavorful and tasted great.  Vegetable samosa- very good Chicken Tikka Masala- tender meat and flavorful sauce Vegetable Korma- Flavorful curry Garlic Naan- not to heavy and fresh  I did order everything not spicy, considering my fellow diners.  Although I would have upped the spiciness level for myself a bit.    The service was great as well, our waiter was friendly and very efficient.  The atmosphere is decorated very nicely.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with 2 friends, ordered the chicken bryani.. big mistake..the rice was so dry and unappetizing like it just came out from the microwave. Asked 2 servers for a curry sauce on the side to help boost the flavor.. sauce never arrived. Had to leave the whole dish for the kitchen after 3 bites..bad bad experience, will never go back !"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food and great service. The staff is very helpful in identifying food you would like if you just aren't that familiar with all the different curries. It is so good we go once a week."}
{"text":"The Blue Taj is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area by far.  I've been twice with my latest visit a few months ago.  I ordered things that weren't exactly on the menu.  The waiter, who was really nice and knowledgeable asked what things I wanted and I said I like tomatoes, peppers, and I like my curry spicy. The dish they brought out was exactly what I wanted and tasted awesome  The Naan was good and the paneer appetizer was great as well.  If you've never had Indian food or you are an Indian food pro, this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"have been intermittently visiting this place since the last 6 years; unfortunately, quality lately has been hit or miss; will avoid the buffet on sunday; lesser number of options compared to other nearby indian restaurants; many of the dishes end up tasting the same! (one of the servers was joking  when i was telling him about similar taste in multiple dishes--he said \"this is the gravy made this week; try coming next week and you might get different tasting gravy\"!!!!); good and attentive service staff though whenever we go for dinner but gets very loud at busy periods. malai kulfi is their asset and so is shahi paneer (we sort of go there just to eat these two things)."}
{"text":"Wow was this Indian food ever great. We are from the MD area visiting here and love Indian food, and this was some of the best we had. Bin our waiter was great, the food was out of this world and if we lived here we'd go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Food sucks. Bad customer service.Very expensive for the quality and ambience. Only good thing is in a good area."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is absolutely to die for!  I love their food, service and ambiance. It is definitely the best restaurant in Ballantyne Village. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for the best butter chicken in town and I found it!  Food was great and filling!  Definitely will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  My husband and I eat lunch here a few times a month.  We are on a limited budget and its a real treat for us to go out to lunch and really never going anywhere but Blue Taj.  Why risk it?   A staff member we particularly love, Bim filled us in on how the food is so wonderfully flavored, all the spices are hand tempered.  Yeah what dedication and devotion they have to their high quality of food.   The flavors of their dishes are incredible and everyone we've recommended Blue Taj to looovvvve it."}
{"text":"First off I love indian food. My girlfriend n I we're in charlotte visiting from.california. and I wanted her to try indian food. The environment was upbeat with the decor and lighting. And the waiyets were top notch very friendly and helpful. We ordered the.chai tea and some curry dishes. Gotta order spicy tho. She orders mild and I felt.like it. Would be so much better hot. Price is good for the quality an taste.of.our.meal. 4.5/5 definitely go back and try the whole menu"}
{"text":"The first time I went there, I was reluctant, thinking it would be overpriced like others in Ballantyne Village.  I was so wrong. This place is quaint enough to take your spouse but something you could enjoy weekly.  The Tikka Masala (spelling?) is great and another dish that I will not attempt to spell that has an onion based sauce is spectacular. The service is as good as it could be seeing that the place is always packed (during lunch).  I go 2-3 times per month because it's a great deal and the service is friendly and always with a smile. Try it and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Charlotte. I used to go to copper all the time but now I usually drive to Ballantyne if I want Indian because blue taj is just awesome. You seriously can't beat the value of the lunch deal. Soup/salad, curry dish, naan, and a side of spiced potatoes and rice, all for about $11-12. I just love the richness and depth of flavor in the curries. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  Blue Taj is one of my favorite restaurants in South Charlotte.  The staff is very friendly and are great guides if you are new to Indian food.  My favorite is lamb in the lentil sauce.  And, even if you are not a cauliflower fan, you have to try the cauliflower appetizer.    Whether you prefer your food on the milder side, or native hot (level 5), they can adjust almost any dish to your liking.    I"}
{"text":"staff at reception perhaps needs to learn some manners. ordered food to take out and  it took ages to prepare and none of the staff including manager has courtesy to offer seat while I was kept waiting near reception. who cares how the food is if they don't know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"My colleague in Charlotte highly recommended this place and we reserved for dinner for a party of five on Wednesday (weekday). Should I say I was disappointed...yes utterly disappointed. The ambience was ornate and very cozy. But the service took ages and when asked, we were told that it was a busy day. I went around to check how busy it was, and less than 20% of the tables were occupied. Do not know what the problem was. The food itself came out as quite not upto the mark...Maybe 3 stars for the food. But plenty of scope to improve on the service. Will I visit again? Yes, if there was a compelling reason."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to this restaurant,i had heard a lot about the chicken tikka masala that is served there , so no doubt wanted to try that as the first thing. I liked the taste of it ,it had all the butter and spices to make it a good chicken tikka masala. We tried the malai kulfi too,i didnt like the sprinkled thing at the top, but overall it was good."}
{"text":"The management prefers servicing any customer as long as you are Caucasian. The basic concept of Indian hospitality is to treat every guest to the best, whereas the concept for this restaurant seems to revolve around ignoring the indian customers and ensuring all their white customers are provided with all the attention. Make your pick if that's the business you want your dollars supporting. The owner should be ashamed at such a racist culture being the prevalent focus of this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's not often I make the trip out to Ballantyne... But for Blue Taj's naan and Chicken Tikka Masala, I will hop in the car right now! This place is legit. Very modern and unique decor with a cozy atmosphere and excellent service. Ask for Bhim!"}
{"text":"Best indian food I have had in USA , their pani puri at Sunday buffet is to die for !! Decor is very classy / hip !!  Cool outdoor seating too ..."}
{"text":"Everything is nice except price. I have eat at best called restaurants in Minneapolis- minnesota, Columbus- ohio,Ashville - north carolina, new jersey, chicago....but best customer service and consistently tasty food I never found. But the prices are killing. I just order two vegetables curry to go and it's $30...really!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed on two separate occasions with the customer service/staff. This evening upon requesting a table, the host's first question was essentially how long do you think your meal will take? There was certainly no shortage of seats. Not a very welcoming greeting. On a prior visit, this time with a friend, our waiter approached the table and said, \"let me guess, two chicken tikka masalas?\" My friend and I found this off putting. I do not enjoy being stereotyped over dinner. I will not be taking my friends or family back after these two experiences."}
{"text":"We were at Sunday buffet with our 18 month old baby. The food was good, nice variety. We were talking about coming  back.  All that until we were ready to checkout. They charged a kids buffet ($7.95) for my 18 month who is still on baby food. When we asked the guy he just reprinted another receipt taking off  kids buffet.  No apology, no acknowledgement. I would suggest checking what is on the receipt before you pay.  An apology or acknowledging the mistake would have been nice. I don't think we will be back there any time soon ."}
{"text":"WOAH!!! This place is amazing! From the food to the service! I'm in town for the night and after cruising Yelp I knew I needed to give them a try. Since I'm solo I felt a little funny dining alone so I did take-out. When I arrived I was greeted by a friendly smile and an employee willing to give his suggestions which I always love to hear what the employees like best. So I went with the chicken tikka masala, vegetable somosa, and garlic naan. It was by far the best I've had! The chicken was tender but not mushy and with just the right amount of spice. The rice was even amazing!  Now I know I shouldn't grade them on their service since I did take-out but they were the nicest group of gentlemen. They offered their bar for me to wait. Every server who walked past asked if I wanted something to drink. The manager came over to acknowledge they are preparing my food. I can't wait to come back to Ballantyne and take my husband here. He's never had Indian food before but I'm confident anything he eats here he will love!"}
{"text":"Really weird - I've been to this place two times.  On both occasions, the food was amazing.  Really good top to bottom (this last time we ordered the veggie app, chicken korma, and the lamb with spinach -oh, can't forget the garlic naan).  The waitress was genuinely sweet, but a tad slow.  Most likely because she had too many tables.    My beef, again, is with the hostess stand.  I've now commented on this twice and I see at least one more review with similar feedback.  This visit, the hostess seemed frustrated at our arrival.  I walked up to the desk and said \"Hello, I'm Zach, we have a reservation for 2 at 6:30\" to which the hostess replied while rolling her eyes \"Everyone has a reservation tonight.  Please follow me.\"  So not only was it an inappropriate comment, if I could fully interpret what she meant, but she proceeded to sit us at a table that had yet to be cleared and seemed bitter the entire time.   Provide some customer service training to the hostess staff and I'll most likely give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow, this has to be the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant, and I've been to places that no human being should ever set foot in, around the world.  We waited here for over 15 minutes, and not one person came to take our order.  That doesn't even happen in Manhattan!  You can see the workers here play favorites, though: I don't know if it was the the manager or just some worker running the show that day, but he had a long conversation in Hindi with some family with their kid, and then let them in and serve them....all the while pretending that we and some other patrons were not there.  Whoever owns this place: this took place at lunch time on Veterans Day, 2013.  I think you need to fire or deport some people here.  One person who was really nice was the lady up front.  She was really kind and welcoming,  and it looked like she was angry at the servers for being slack, but they were disrespecting her.  It was sad to see.    This place looks nice and has nice decor: but 15 minutes with no service?  Maybe they think they are in India, and patrons need to bribe the servers for service?  Seriously, do NOT go there if you are starving or on a date with someone you care about.  You will be utterly humiliated.  It's like that episode of \"Seinfeld\" where they go to a Chinese Restaurant, but never get seated; the only difference is that you get seated, but then forgot about and left to die.  lol.  We just walked out and got great service at Mellow Mushroom a few doors down.  Great vegan pizza there.  We were visiting Charlotte and whenever we return, we won't be coming to the Blue Taj, which should be renamed the \"Ewww Taj.\""}
{"text":"First experience with Indian food. It was definitely an experience - I can't say Indian is my favorite food at this point but it had some great spice. Service was great and very attentive throughout the whole dinner. I'm willing to try it again and maybe I'll find my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Legen... wait for it... dary!!! Amazing food, awesome service, my favorite place in charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went here with the wife and we both had great food. She got the Masala Chicken - which she really liked - and I got a goat dish which was exceptional. You can sit both inside and outside which is nice on a late summer evening. The inside is decorated nicely, and the staff was very courteous."}
{"text":"Great food! Very smooth, perfect blend of spices. I had the Chicken marsala, it was great!  Best Indian in Charlotte. I didn't give it five stars because our table was so tiny the food plates had to overlap, giant plates, tiny table. Service was good, I had a very hard time hearing and understanding the waiter but he was very nice and attentive but not over attentive. Didn't feel at all rushed even though it was a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"Awkward experience with yummy food!   Like a tourist restaurant that only expects to serve you once, I guess because the coupons and gift certificates are so widely available.   Reviews are 100% accurate. Not cozy or intimate. You sit at tiny tables way to close to other diners in a very open setting. Awkward. Modern decor but just plain awkward seating arrangement with sounds bouncing around everywhere and ridiculously noisey chairs making loud farting sounds every time you move them. Ridiculous for sure.  The place is hard to find, directly across from mellow mushroom hidden in a sidewalk \"breezeway\".  Understaffed seems the norm. You will get your water refilled but definitely not your drinks.   The garlic naan is yummy and the white rice is delicious. I would still prefer whole grain options on both. Dinner was good, small expensive portions but just enough to take a little home. If you want an extra drink or extra bread definitely order it with your meal.   One attractive waiter serves too many tables with the assistance of a bus/water girl and a food expediter both of whom speak little English and can do very little for you. I would go back if I had another free gift certificate but would try even harder for off hours and I would keep my service expectations low and order extra garlic naan and a drink refill early. Get reservations too."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times. The wait staff and excellent, attentive and the food is always top notch. The ambiance is cool and date appropriate."}
{"text":"I like the food but few people are so rude especially when it's a busy night. I don't like how they react to people of their own community when they are themselves Indian.   I asked for the seating to be changed when few other tables were empty but this guy (who calls himself manager) refused and was so rude. I believe they need to polite and loving to their own people and stop being rude."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of 6. We had reservations and got seated right away. Service was very attentive and friendly. Our server was a young guy who was quick on his feet, nicely explained the different menu options and helped everyone decide what spice level would work best for them. I had the non-vegetarian appetizer sampler first. It was a combination of some Tandoori items (chicken, lamb and salmon I believe). It was good but probably a bit much for an appetizer, would be perfect for two people. I then had the much reviewed Tikka Masala and it was very good. I've had Tikka Masala before at some places on the west coast that I liked a little better, mainly because they included chunks of tomato and onion. Overall a very nice place, great interior design, great service and very good food. It was very busy on a Saturday night, so you want to make sure you got reservations."}
{"text":"We were in the area for work and my wife wanted to go here since she was craving some Indian food. She found this on Yelp and since I read some of the reviews...I had a feeling it was going to be \"Americanized\" Indian food. Poor service the moment we walked in....hostess was not welcoming and refused to give us a different table because the table she took us to a small itsy bitsy table for my wife and I. There's many options to choose to eat in this area and you choose to not accommodate us? Advice for the hostess...you need a job change, because hospitality/service is not working for you. No one wants to see your sour freckled face before they walk in for dinner. It's okay...we are spoiled with better service and real Indian food in Seattle...for now I'll just stick to good ol' soul food for the time we are visiting North Carolina :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, great atmosphere and friendly staff. The same care is put into take out as if you were dining in. I order from here often and have yet to have anything but a stellar experience:)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here has a modern ambiance and flare.  The dishes are traditional and you get to pick the level of heat (1-5).  I had the Scallop Nilgiri Kurma (heat level 3) and it had more heat than I would have preferred.  Go lower than you want!  Also be careful sitting near the door in the winter because the draft will freeze you!  You have to buy naan if you want it where as some Indian restaurants serve it complimentary.  I thought it was ok but I really like the modern Indian dishes at Copper personally."}
{"text":"The food and the service was absolutely amazing!!  I got the chicken tikka masala and a side of naan and it was almost impossible to stop eating. The server was very friendly and helped explain some of the dishes when I had questions. They were very quick to refill my drink and check to see if the food was to our liking. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for great Indian food!  I hope to be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Why Blue Taj doesn't have 5 stars is beyond me.  Blue Taj (and their sister restaurant Copper) is hands down the best indian food I've ever had in my life, let alone in Charlotte.  I eat here at least 2-3x per week.  Everything I have had is awesome.  I usually order Chicken Tikka Masala because it's so good, every time I think I want to order something else, I come back to it.  It really is THAT GOOD.  But Southern Indian Curry is also amazing, as is the Curry Goat and butter chicken (if you like dark meat).  Samosas are on point as well.  Their lunch specials are great and the ambiance is perfect for date night.  The service is always amazing."}
{"text":"I don't eat Indian alot and I went here with my date and it was amazing. She wasn't sure what to order and received an amazing suggestion. I had the  Chicken Tikka Masala, which was incredible. We also had Naan and Samosa's that were great too! The service was excellent and the atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the most enjoyable meals and evenings I've had in Charlotte. The food is incredibly tasty but the service is beyond anything I've experienced. Support this local Treasure!"}
{"text":"Indian food, Americanized :) Good service! Tables are small for the number of people to be seated."}
{"text":"My family dined at the Blue Taj for an after Christmas meal.  We ordered:      Popadams (Starter)     Shahi Paneer (Vegetarian)     Amritsari Chicken Tikka     Tandoor Ka Jhinga (Prawn Tandoor)     Tandoori Chicken     Sides: Nan, Rice, Plain Raita  The first time I went to this place, I LOVEED it. Indian food is one of constant top three favorite types of food (though don't ask me the other two, they're constantly rotating...) While it's far from the best Indian I've had, it's a relief such places exist in Charlotte.  I took my family here after Xmas, since most had never had Indian. Everything looked pretty good, but the Chicken Curry had a bit too much fenugreek flavour for my liking, and the chicken looked a bit dry. The Shahi Paneer was a bit too saucy (all the Paneer had crumbled, and didn't see signs of Cashews, which would have been nice). But when I asked them to make it \"Indian hot\" - they did. And it made my very happy.  Rankings      # of times dined here: 2nd     Cost of Bill incl. Tip: around $100 for 4ppl     Food Rating: 7/10     Service Rating: 7/10"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for Indian food in Charlotte.  We used to live in London and had top notch Indian there regularly, so our expectations our high.  I know everyone says Copper is the best, but I have always had bad service there and just don't think the food is as good.    The lamb chop here is great.  It's a main course item though, so if you are trying to get curries and dishes for the table to share,as is customary with Indian restaurants, just know that.  We love the tikKa masala and the korma is great too.  We always get the garlic naan and raita to go with everything.  It's great for take out.  The restaurant itself is comfortable and the decor is a little funky, the service has always been good.  I havent tried their Sunday buffet but would love to.  It's always a great way to try new Indian dishes that you may not normally order."}
{"text":"This will be your new favorite Indian restaurant. Everything on the menu is absolute perfection. The Blue Taj is the only eating establishment that I would consider myself a true regular of... The servers are very attentive and the food is high quality, always colorful and delicious. If I could only eat at one restaurant for the rest of my life, it'd be this one. Saag Paneer and Paneer Tikka Masala w/ naan forever. Treat your date to a movie in the theater up the elevator, then a meal at the Blue Taj and congratulations, you're already a  professional lover.   There's also a restaurant closer to uptown called Copper Modern, owned by the same people, so if your up that way, try it. Same deal, equally amazing."}
{"text":"Blue Taj, I have waited for a year to find you here in Charlotte, and now I feel more complete.   I've always thought the best Indian restaurants are in Boston, where I went to college and where my in-laws live.  But no more.    The decor is dark but bright and uber-modern, and frankly I wasn't sure if this was one of the more overrated restaurants that's all about decor, and rate low on taste.  Instead, the food is seasoned extremely well, prepared authentically, and the servers are very helpful explaining any unfamiliar menu items.   I highly reccommend getting the appetizer sampler (vegetarian or meat) which is tiny, but just right to get a taste of many of their starters.   Instead of ordering the usual chicken tikka, I asked my server what he recommended, and I ended up with a delicious shrimp, scallop and fish in a curry-coconut spice sauce...divine!   The nan here is puffy, tender and crisp in the right places too.  Our server explained how he likes to get it out at the right time so it's served fresh and hot like it should be.   My husband's kabob medly too was some of the best tandoori chicken I've ever had.  Not tough and overcooked like other white chicken dishes, but just right.    For dessert, we took some gulab jamun to go, which were tiny balls of dough, soaked in a honey syrup.  It was ok, but a nice ending to a large meal.   Service: The first time we went, it was ultra slow, but the second time, we asked for expedited service so I could get back to work, and our server was spot-on and got us in and out of there in about an hour.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"im pretty impressed, food was fab. So many flavors, if your in the mood for something different try this place"}
{"text":"I do not know a lot about Indian food but they were amazing here. The Server helped me pick out a great dish, and every time I have been here the food and service are still amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used a Living Social deal for this restaurant.  We preferred it over Copper.  The serving size was much larger and the food was delicious.  We had the Chatpate Tikki Chole for appetizer - Spiced potato patties served over a bed of a zesty garbanzo beans stew and topped with duo of mint and tamarind chutneys - highly recommend it! So much flavor!  I had chicken tikka masala and garlic naan and my husband had Tandoori Lamb.  Both of them were excellent.  There was enough for us to take home and have for dinner the following night.  I just made some rice to go along with it.  We'll visit here again...with a restaurant.com certificate.  It's a little pricey.  Chairs weren't exactly comfy but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"While on travel for work I went to Blue Taj based on a friends recommendation. The food was good the service was good and although I ate at the bar the decor was nice too.    I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome. Chicken tikka masala was the best. Good selection of wines. Ambience was outstanding. Service was very attentive.  Reservation is must for weekend. Worth trying"}
{"text":"Food is ok service is terrible. God forbid u have to send something back! They treat you like crap.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food and service surrounded by a quite atmosphere"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here, even though it is pricier than I am used to in other Indian restaurants. Tonight I came in and ordered Garlic Naan to go. That's it. I placed my order at approximately 8:55, and just walked out because no one seemed to know about it. The other reason I am writing this review is because the man at the front who was taking my order was constantly coughing. In this deathly flu season, someone unable to stop coughing is not who I hope to be exchanging credit cards or taking money. I ended up asking for a refund and am leaving without the Garlic Naan bc it no one knew about my order and I can't afford to spend more time waiting while is coughing. SN: I do fully recognize it is Valentine's night, but 30-40 minutes for a to go order of Garlic Naan is not a huge or complicated."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding from minute we walk in! Recommend reservations as this place is usually very full every time we go (we go a lot) We don't use the menus as it's easier to tell Vic what we want.....perfect every time!!!  Place is clean and noise level low so I can actual hear the people I'm dining with!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday - truly enjoyed the meal, the service and the ambiance - great flavors ! Definitely recommended and will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent Food, Friendly Server  Cons: Overall experience - we waited 15 minutes to be greeted by our server, everything was extremely slow in coming out, tables around us had: 1 dish sent back, 1 glass of water spilled on a patron (didn't see the actual server on scene until 10 minutes after the fact), and everyone complaining about the speed."}
{"text":"Working under the assumption that a restaurant is only as good as its most recent reviews, I feel I need to update my previously glowing review of Blue Taj to reflect the experience I had at lunch there today.  Unlike most local Indian restaurants, Blue Taj serves off a menu, not a buffet, for a weekday lunch. They also have some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala in town, so I stopped in today.  I was seated by a gentleman who appeared to be the manager, and throughout my meal it was never clear who my waiter or waitress actually was. After seeing me wait for several minutes with no one coming to take my order, the manager came by and took my order.  My food was brought out in a perfectly reasonable period of time, but the issue today was water, plain and simple.   I'm an easy customer at Blue Taj. I know exactly what I want, and I pretty much just drink water with my meal. Keep my water glass filled, and heck - just glance over at it once in awhile to check, and I'm happy.  The two women who were waiting on all the tables around me, couldn't be bothered to look in my direction once. Every single time I needed more water, I had to wait several minutes, try to catch someone's eye, and flag them down. It was a different person every time.  What really sealed the deal for this one star review was when I flagged the server rushing past me without a glance after dropping off someone's check and asked her if I could have some more water.  \"Sure, I'll get that,\" she said. And as I sat in full view of the cash register and water pitchers, I saw her walk up to the register and start talking to a friend who came into the restaurant. I don't know if my request never actually entered her mind, if it slipped her mind the first second after that, or in the 10 seconds it took her to go up and socialize with her friend and forget all about her job, but I was annoyed.  After that failure, I had to wait for the manager, who was outside talking on his cell phone, to come back in, finally turn around after 5 minutes and glance at the tables, and flag HIM to bring me some water. It's not rocket science to keep a glass of water filled.  After today's experience, I plan to just keep going for the buffet at Hyderabadi Biryani House down the road for lunch when my Indian food craving hits. Sure, buffet chicken tikka masala isn't as good as a freshly prepared individual dish, but at least they can keep a water glass filled."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about my experience at The Blue Taj.  I live in the Northlake area, so I don't make it out to Ballantyne hardly ever.  My husband and I love Indian Food and had this on our list of restaurants to try, and I'm so happy we made the drive.  The entire wait staff was super friendly and attentive.  I have a gluten allergy, and was thrilled to see that I could eat almost everything on the menu.  We asked for recommendations, and were blown away by how amazing the food was.  I've been dreaming about the food ever since.  My only complaint is that it's so far away from where I live - otherwise I would be back every week.  Eat here now!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere for a girls night out or any celebration! Loved their Chicken Tikka Masala, simmered lamb entree paires with some in house hot sauce to go with it! Definitly a great find in South Charlotte! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Staying consistent - love it every single time, perfectly great.  Staff is friendly and warm, food is always exceptional - love it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I would go back again.  The food is great!  The chili chicken appetizer has awesome flavor and a good kick.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala both times and was not disappointed either time.  The chicken itself is tender and flavorful, but the sauce is unbelievable!  The service is somewhat interesting, and the only drawback.  The first time, I went with a female friend and was basically ignored.  She had superb service, but it was as if I wasn't even at the table.  She had to basically order for me!  I am just gonna chalk that up to my dinner guests distracting beauty. The next time I went, I was not ignored at all, and the wait service was adequate, a little slow with the check but overall friendly and helpful.  The strange part of the second visit was the wait to be seated.  We went on a Friday and had no reservation, but I counted literally 15+ open tables that remained open the entire 20 minute wait time to be seated AND the entire time my guest and I were actually eating.  I can understand waiting and can be patient if there are no tables open, or if there are actually a lot of people coming in with reservations, but come on, 15+ tables that remained empty the entire hour and a half including WAIT TIME?  The food is worth the hassle of the service, I just hope maybe they read this and do something about the problem.  I definitely will be visiting again though."}
{"text":"The Blue Taj is not the worst Indian restaurant I've been to. The food is tasty, the ambiance is swanky. The prices are average for an Indian dinner.  The plates used are conducive to being handled by hands. The presentation is good. The portion looks small, but are larger sections.   Cons:  My biggest complaint to this place is the arrangement. The entrance to the place [where the hostess is] is closed off, and there is a sign for people to enter from the side door [covered by an unheated tent] This is very awkward, and can cause conflict for people leaving and entering. Another issue is due to this setup there is no buffer between people eating and the air coming in from the door. I saw a couple refuse to eat there because of this. The flavor of the chicken tika masala, wasn't very out standing. It was a sauce, but it wasn't very complex. I asked for a 4/5 spice level, so I expected there to be a kick to the dish. There was none."}
{"text":"Ok why leave the take out orders by the door which is not watched? Yes someone stole our food. Smh"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at the Blue Taj, you are met with an ambiance that could be mistaken for a yuppie martini bar, with the fancy pastel lighting, weird fiberglass chairs and tables, etc. I usually steer clear of these types of places, feeling that they are trying to be too trendy and contemporary; This is where the management usually focuses their efforts on...form over substance, and the food is generally given a seat on the back-burner. And let's be honest, we are in Ballantyne, NC...not LA, NY, or Miami. However, we were here, and hungry, so I decided to put my misgivings aside and dive on in.   Turns out, my initial worries were quickly laid to rest. The food was amazing and authentic. The Tomato Coconut Bisque had the perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and salty...my three favorite culinary attributes. For the main course, my wife chose a safe bet...Chicken Tikka Masala, which she said was out of this world. Me, being a little more daring, went with the Lamb Vind Alho (sp?). The rich spice in this dish was amazing...but at the same time, not the most overpowering, burn the roof off your mouth, Vind Alho I've ever had, which was actually a pleasant surprise.   Service was great...run like a military operation, but with much more personality. Perfectly timed drink order, appetizer/entiree delivery, and check presentation. Our server took time with my wife (an Indian food first timer!) to explain certain dishes to her, even though he was clearly slammed on a busy Friday night.   Price is the only issue with this restaurant...it runs a little high for Indian food. If want to keep more of your hard earned greenbacks in your pocket, but want the same quality food, I suggest Cafe Nirvana, right down the street from Blue Taj...all the same great food, with half the pretense of a trendy hangout!"}
{"text":"I still love this place! Is it authentic Indian cuisine? How the heck would I know...I've never been to India! All I know (and care about) is that the food & service remains above average. The wine by the glass list is still small but now has more adventurous choices."}
{"text":"Good food but service needs improvement. Our entrees came out with the rice but the naans took forever. We got the naans after we were almost done eating.  Food quality and quantity was excellent.  I will give it another try since the food was so good. If the service is still bad, then I might write it off."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here.  The decor/ambience is so nice - I really loved it.    We got the veggie platter for an app - it was all delicious, especially the samosas :) We got a curry dish and chicken tikka misala with rice & naan.  Both entrees were fantastic!  The naan was fresh baked and it was perfect.    We even got desser - we ordered the Indian ice cream and it was so unique and tasty.  I'm not sure what flavor it was, but it was really interesting and I would get it again!    My only complaint was they didn't clear any of our plates from the table, so it was pretty cramped towards the end of our meal.  Other than that, this place was great!!"}
{"text":"The food, location and parking are good. The service is slow, and the lighting dim. But if you have time and want good Indian in S Charlotte, it's solid.  The appetizers tend to be small (good entree size, though). I wish they'd add Chicken Saag, but I've enjoyed all entrees I've had here."}
{"text":"Amazing place! To be brief, the service was awesome and the food & drinks were delicious! We came in on a Friday, without a reservation. The wait wasn't long at all. The staff was great. Very pleasant and helpful. In addition, the bartender used to be the head bartender of Carnival Crusies! When I asked for a special request, (a frozen margarita) the server called him over and he was so friendly and more than happy to whip up my requests! He even came over later to check and make sure I liked it. Such a personable place!! You don't get this type of service just anywhere!"}
{"text":"Great service, attentive waiter was happy to explain menu items and help make a choice.   Experience, appetizer, entree were all 5 star, but dessert was a bust."}
{"text":"This place looks good. Ambience is nice but they serve Americanized Indian food. We asked for spicy chicken Biryani and I felt they added more chilly powder."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great choices. Reservations required. I like leak kofta and veg biryani."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Blue Taj.  The food was really great.  The atmosphere and ambience was pretty good.  I actually sat out in the tent area that had great mood lighting!  The interior of the tent actually changed colors.  The food was really really good and full of flavor.  The service was good.  It was however, the first Indian restaurant that I had gone to...and had to pay extra for naan!  That was a little surprising...and disappointing.  However it was pretty good.  I plan on going again the next time I am in that area.  It was certainly worth the drive from downtown to Ballantyne."}
{"text":"There are lots of great Indian Restaurants in Charlotte but this is by far our go to. The staff are very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions. The food is incredible. I recommend the Chicken Korma or Kerala Style seafood. If you are new to Indian food their Chicken Tikka Masala is amazing and fairly safe. Also do yourself a favor and get at least two orders of garlic naan, it's addicting!"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed! Superb flavor on everything. Super nice and friendly staff made us feel at like we were guests in there house. Nice atmosphere. We had an amazing experience from start to finish. It is rare for me to give five stars, but this place hit all my stringent requirements for a five star rating! We are definitely coming back and telling people about it!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Indian food I have ever had. The decor is clean and modern, and prices are very inexpensive. My mom and I are visiting Charlotte and came here this evening. The flavors were clean, fresh and delicious - the specific textures and flavors came out in the food, and there was no overpowering spiciness. Our waiter was friendly, had a very relaxed and calm demeanor, and was extremely helpful when it came to ordering. I've had Indian food in a lot of different places and this was honestly the best I can remember having."}
{"text":"You will leave feeling blue and a little green.  The overpriced appetizer, the Tandoori Platter, consisted of two bite sized shrimp, two bite sized chunks of chicken and two bite sized pieces of, \"lamb.\" At 2.17 per bite, this was SO not worth it. The prawns were rubbery and fishy. We could not even cut them with the edge of our forks, that's how rubbery they were. The chicken was dry and flavorless, I left about $1 worth on the plate and the lamb was undetectable as lamb, tasting more like overboiled beef.  None of the delicious fatty, gamey lamb flavor.  No salt or pepper on the tables either so, could not help it with seasoning. The entrèes we ordered were Lamb curry and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Two soup bowls were brought to the table and a dish of rice.  Again, my lamb very well could have been flavorless beef, there was no way to discern that it was actually lamb.  The sauce had a slight hint of coconut but, not much.  The chicken, likewise, was dry but, at least the sauce was a little better.  The naan had a good texture but, some portions had a fishy taste that had me worried the were handled incorrectly after handling seafood. To their credit, the fried bananas and ice cream was tasty and actually edible as was the Perrier. However, we were up for hours with nausea and stomach cramps.  My guess is those fishy prawns and the fishy naan. Save your money, find a recipe on the internet, and buy fresh ingredients to cook sanitary food at home.  What a shame this restaurant has such inflated prices and inflated ratings, so many people will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always consistently good and had a nice modern atmosphere. I usually get the chicken in a cashew cream sauce which is to die for, or the paneer (cheese) tikka masala. My husband will try the lamb dishes or more exotic fare...I stick to the same things because they are just so good! Love the appetizers as well and the naan is fresh and flavorful. Definitely worth it if you're in ballantyne! Or even if you're not :-)"}
{"text":"I was expecting too much from the place but whole place was a big show off.. The hospitality sucked and the howt and servers were rude and sloppy. Also the food wasnt authentic indian but an americanized version."}
{"text":"Very over priced. Palak paneer was nice. Small portions for desert though.  The worst thing was the peshwari naan! It had cherries in it!! Really not nice at all!!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here. I have enjoyed both lunch and dinner, just well done. The food is fabulous and the staff is excellent! I have been a regular for many years and will continue to support this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The chicken tiki masala was by far the best I have ever had!! I would creep up on the spice, the level 5 was a bit much, just don't stop eating kind of spice. But a 3 was what my date had and it was perfectly cooked. Both had really tender chicken and garlic naan to pot it with."}
{"text":"THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON TAKE OUT ONLY!  I had been craving Indian food, and my girlfriend brought it over for a movie night...  I had Chicken Tikka Masala with garlic naan... It was flavorful, perfectly spiced, the chicken was tender, the naan was SO delicious... this was the best take out I've ever had.  EVER!"}
{"text":"The shai paneer was excellent!  Nice bar and ambiance   Definitely more pricey then the two dollar."}
{"text":"Being the Social Media Juander that I am....I depend on Social Media networks for entertainment, information and deals! I mean, it is a reccession! What I do is view deals on Groupon/Living Social and then read Yelp reviews to see if I should purchase them or not. The Blue Taj had mixed reviews, some complained of the spicy food, the crowds, the swanky design. Those who liked it lauded the food selection and price.  I took a chance based on this and wasn't dissatisfied! I visited during lunch, so it was not as crowded. Bim, our waiter made my friend and I feel as if we were the only ones in the restaurant. His service with a personal touch added to the ambiance. This is definitely not your normal Indian restaurant with good food but Big Lots decorations! It's tucked in the back under the theatre.....but once you enter it's like stepping into a new world. The food is good, not great. To be honest it's an amercanized version of Indian food.....so if you are an Indian food fanatic you have to request your food be made spicier. I had the Curry Salmon.....and my friend had the Mata Paneer(sp?) We were both statisfied with our dishes and LOVED our mango lasis! All in all a great place, great service and good food! Worth a second, third or fourth trip!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal at the Blue Taj.  After hearing about this place for almost a year, we finally made the time to give them a try.  We are so glad we did.  The service was excellent, attentive, and friendly.  The food was incredible and the value was good.  We were hesitant at first because of the cramped feel.  As we were seated and got comfortable it was actually pretty nice.  The arrangement makes each table feel pretty private.    We had an appetizer and two lunches which was a tremendous amount of food.  Neither my wife nor I were able to finish it all, even though we really wanted to.  My spicy chicken curry was phenomenal.  It had great flavor with a nice heat.  The rice was cooked perfectly and had a great aroma.  The Naan, oh my goodness was it good.  My wife's southern Indian curry was also very good.  I would either of them again without hesitation.  We really enjoyed our lunch.  The food exceeded our expectations and has ready for many return trips!"}
{"text":"The Best Indian we've found since residing in the QC. Blu has been a savior to us Northern'ers in search of good Indian food.  We have so many options and choices up North that are awesome and once we got to the QC there were slim pickins for GOOD Indian cuisine.  We frequent Ballantyne Village for various restaurants like Terrace Cafe and Jade, one night we looked toward the back and noticed the sign. I pulled his place up on Yelp to bookmark and started reviewing the reviews and took a mental note. A couple of weeks later the hubby and I decided to go out for a date and that is when o suggested this place. I made reservations on OpenTable.  Upon arrival the hostess greeted is and was extremely pleasant. Once seated we noticed Indian families gathering and eating. My husband and I have a theory that if you are having a cuisine from a certain country and the natives of that country aren't eating it, that insist that the food is still good or authentic. Seeing this made us happy and the waitress was very knowledgeable.  We ended up with two dishes that the chef made up according to what we explained to the waitress that we liked :-) The sauces were full of flavor and the naan was fresh and flavorful. I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Another stellar take-out order from Blue Taj.  I figured out what the delicious potato ball dish was - it is called Leek Kofta.  AMAZING!  A mom in my playgroup told me they do brunch and that it's stellar....on the to-do list SOON!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the fabulous food at Blue Taj, especially the chicken tikka masala. We shared the vegetables samosa which is delicious and savory. The chicken tikka masala curry is perfectly seasoned and delicious. The garlic naan is savory and hearty. The white wine albarino is awesome! They are super busy so plan on a reservation or waiting for a table. We had a reservation but they were packed so we waited about 10 minutes for our table at the bar.  It worked out because we were able to eat outside and it was a perfect fall evening. Parking is in the garage nearby and it's usually easy to find parking."}
{"text":"Checked out Blue Taj for a business lunch recently and was a little underwhelmed, especially after reading some of the reviews. The place is located in the Ballantyne Village, but it's a little hidden in the back under the escalators. There is some outdoor seating but it faces the parking garage. It was also pretty dark inside, which if I was on a date, may have been ok, but for a business lunch, the mood didn't need to be set :)   All the lunch entrees were under $10. Ordered the popular chicken tikka masala, which came with soup/salad. The salad didn't sound interesting, so I went with the the coconut tomato bisque. It had great flavor and set the stage for me. The entree came separate with rice and the tikka masala. The tikka masala was good, but not great. My only issue was that the flavor of the soup and the entree were so close (red cream sauce) that it felt like a continuation of the soup with some change . May not make sense, but a different soup choice would be nice especially since the tikka masala is so popular."}
{"text":"We went to the Blue Taj for the first time this past Saturday night.  I love the dim lighting and Indian decor and tapestry draped in the main dining room.  It really creates the perfect ambiance.  Unfortunately, we weren't seated there.  We were seated in a white and blue modernly decorated hallway next to the windows with a wall between us and the much nicer dining room.  Our table was on the end, too, next to both sets of doors to the outdoors.  There was a lot of coming and going and blasts of heat.  Ahhh...   We were seated right away for our 7:45 reservation.  We took two steps from the hostess podium and were seated.  (I told you it was close to the door.)   We received our entrees at 8:45.  We received the complimentary appetizer Naan bread soon after.  So...you tell me how our first experience was?  Our server did make sure our drinks were always filled, and the food (once it arrived, out of sequence, and all at once) was very tasty.   I had the Scallop Nilgiri Kurma (Sea Scallops simmered in a herb-spice paste flavored cashew curry sauce with scallions.)  It was green and flavorful.  I hadn't had scallops in such a long time and I was impressed that they were (for once) reasonably priced at a restaurant.    Would I go back?  Hmm...probably not.  I'm sure you can guess why.  I just don't have enough hours in the day.  We were glad that we weren't doing dinner and a movie that night."}
{"text":"I love eating at The Blue Taj. I do recommend they work on their customer service a little. I noticed the last time I was in there that one of the girls took the fork I was using for my appetizer right out from underneath me as we were still eating -and I snatched it right out of her hand. I think it's rude to assume that people are done eating and try rushing them. Maybe ask patrons if they are finished before taking their dishes and flatware? Another thing that should be fixed are the chairs. Oh. My. Word. I cannot tell anyone how annoying the chairs are. I feel like if I bring my chair out from under the table to sit in it everyone starts to stare at me or something -they are so loud! I would suggest putting something like felt pads under the legs. Other than that, I think everything is good. The food is great, the decor is pretty, the manager is awesome. Oh, and I suggest making a reservation to anyone who wants to get a table for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Had chicken tikka masala and vegetable samosa.  The chicken was moist white meat and a large amount.  It was spiced perfectly.  Samosa was served over a tamarind sauce and it went together very well.  Friend had saag paneer and it was the best I've tasted in a long time.  Overall it was a wonderful experience.  The restaurant is trendy and the wait staff was very pleasant.  Definatly will return."}
{"text":"It was the worst food. My husband birthday mood was spoiled because of eating in blue taj.. I really spoiled his mood by choosing this restaurant. samosa quality was bad.. it was very worst. We ordered shahi paneer. It wasn't shai paneer at all. It taste so yuck. Jeera rice provided with it is next disaster. It wasn't cooked fully. Really wasted my money and spoiled my day too."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and once again I was amazed! I went with a friend who has never been and she was overwhelmed at how great the food and the service was. We both had two drinks, shared two apps and then an entire each. I also had the tomato coconut bisque. Everything about our dining experience was impeccable and I will most definitely be making the drive again real soon. If your not sure what to order, ask for Vickie...he knows how to recommend something that you will be very pleased with."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was modern, upbeat and artistic. I felt the culture. The food was absolutely delicious.  Presentation was everything. The service was impeccable. The waiters are very attentive and gave me quality service. I had the Chatpate Tikki Chole with a potato patties on top of garbanzo beans stew with mint and tamarind chutneys. It was superb and for dinner I enjoyed  the Kerala  Style Seafood with just jumbo shrimp (*my preference) in a Kerala style curry sauce with coconut, spices and tamarind paired with garlic naan and aloo parathas, again delicious. Perfect place for a date, dinner with friends or a more casual business meeting. Love it! Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte. Their buffet is phenomenal, just be sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"Ambience, staff experience and food - all 3 aspects are good. Vikanth was excellent in engaging with us on our choicest order and ensured customer experience. I will definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"Best buffet I had in Charlotte so far. Their pani puri on Sunday buffet is the best. Amazing dishes and desserts!  Great ambience. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite restaurant in Charlotte, we live in the opposite side of town but still drive there pretty regularly. The first time we went to Blue Taj was for Valentine's day dinner 5 years ago, it was my first time eating Indian. I let the server know that I had never had Indian and have no idea what to order, he asked what kind of meet I like, I said seafood, he said I got you... He got me when he called \"seafood Miti Korma\", which is not even on the menu, and it was the best thing I ever had. I actually order the same thing every single time, while my wife has tried all their chicken entrees, loved every singe one. The service is a hit or miss, would be nice if they can work on that. The servers themselves are not bad, they try really hard, but every time we get a new server I get the feeling that they are not trained properly and they are setup to make mistakes, so I hope management takes note of that. By now we have tried pretty much every indian restaurant in town, and none compare to Blue Taj, not even close."}
{"text":"WORSE ..WORSE..Just ordered  goat and chicken biriyani for to-go with medium spice. It's nothing  but full of oil and masala(spice blends). Not at all worth the price. And on Sunday they charge dinner prices for lunch menu.They will not let you know until they bill it . $18 for GOAT Biriyani, and in my opinion you are paying $14 for Oil and Masala +  $4 for actual biriyani. The quantity is only half of what other Indian Cuisines give in this area.Worthless!"}
{"text":"This place has nice atmosphere and decor - that being said, the curtain up front needs to go. It doesn't let anyone know when someone walks in. We stood there for a a while before a hostess found us, and she looked surprised to see us standing there. Get rid of the curtain.  The tables were nicely set with very interesting, \"modern\" silverware and plates. The first glass of water poured was pretty tepid, but that's okay. We ordered, and I have to say, I've never had naan better than here. The naan was the best, I wanted to take a basket home.   I had lamb in a garlic sauce, which was absolutely delicious. However, it didn't sit right with me, and I've never had that problem in any other Indian restaurant. I didn't get like super sick or anything, just a little stomachache. It's not a huge deal.  The price is okay. I couldn't spend what I did every day. Oh, and there is a pretty great wine selection.   I guess I would probably go back, if I was in the area and everything else was closed or packed. I don't know. I'm indifferent."}
{"text":"Joke of an Indian restaurant - gimmicky and pretentious at best, which is probably why many Charlotteans starved of decent Indian cuisine think this place is awesome.   Today was my 2nd visit to the restaurant; first was a pick up order while today my wife and I decided to dine in without reservations.  At the front counter we expressed our interest in being seated outside - 2 out of the 3 ladies standing at the counter said ok/yes, while the third disapprovingly nodded her head and said \"no no, its too windy, no.\" I thought that came out a little rude specially as 4 tables were seated outside, so asked my wife if we should simply leave. She said we'll give it a try, so we agreed to be seated inside.  We then were ushered to a table for 2, right behind another couple who were comfortably seated. Instead of cramping behind them, I asked if it was ok to sit one more table down which was empty. She seemed unsure and said ok after I asked if it was ok twice, then continued to say that if they get a table for 6, they would prefer to use this table to join to the table for 4. I, once again, considered leaving, but was again told to give this place a chance.  The next group of 3 that came to the restaurant asked to be seated outside and were seated outside. What changed in 5 minutes?  Anyways - my wife read the menu in dim lighting and decided to order chili chicken appetizer and a karhai lamb extra spicy entree with onion paneer kulcha and 1 roti.   The chili chicken (4 tiny pieces in a huge, square plate) came out rubbery while the sauce was good. We had one piece each before deciding to wait for the entree.  The karhai lamb with kulcha, roti and rice were brought out to our table a few minutes later. I, once again, thought the gravy of the lamb curry was decent  - but neither of us could chew through even one of the lamb pieces. I have had enough lamb dishes from many different cuisines to know that this was probably how chewing on rubber feels like. We left the curry, all lamb pieces and rice untouched - we both had one piece each of the roti.  We did contemplate if we should speak with the manager, but decided against. I had just had enough and simply wanted to leave. I wonder why many of my colleagues rave about this place; even why yelpers rate this place highly - I can only attribute it to the lack of authentic, Indian restaurants in the area or being mesmerized by the dim, blue, gimmicky interior design of the restaurant.   Passage to India, Spice 9, Cafe Nirvana, Maharani Indian Restaurant are all better choices."}
{"text":"Wow.. if people give this restaurant a 4 star, they are deprived of good Indian food. Please note that my review is only for the weekend buffet lunch. The appetizer (chaat) had cold potatoes, served with various generic cold chutneys which had a bottled aftertaste. The butter chicken was swimming in a thick sauce which was obviously old (cream was curdling and tasted rancid), the chili chicken was not spicy and drenched in oil (I'd suggest the chef goes over to Cafe Nirvana a couple of miles down the road to see what chili chicken should taste like), the dessert was a sooji halwa (cream of wheat with butter, sugar and raisins) often considered a poor man's dessert in Indian circles and never served in restaurants, and a sad looking chocolate souffle of some sort which had not set.   Disappointing, to say the least. If you want better Indian food, try Cafe Nirvana down the road, or Woodlands, or Fu Lin (for Indian hakka Chinese). If you want less expensive Indian food, try any other Indian restaurant in Charlotte except Copper, which is owned by the same person."}
{"text":"Blue Taj used to be our number one choice for Indian food but recently we have experienced a drastic decline in the service.    The crew have a sense of entitlement that permeates across all the staff.   It's a pity that success seems to have gotten to their head.  The food is still good but the service is patchy and uppity.    It's time Charlotte got a strong competitive player in the Indian fine dining space."}
{"text":"Fabulous find while traveling. Great good, fantastic atmosphere and wonderful staff! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner here: yummy garlic naan and chicken tikki masala!! The chicken biryani was just ok. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Only took me two years to come back and try at  lunch. Lol.  Very tasty and nice deal for your wallet. Most options  come with an entree, plain naan& salad/soup for under $12. Not bad and the portion are just right and you will be satisfied.  Service was sufficient  and was not too crowded for a Friday. Promise  to return before another  24 months ;)"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have forgotten to review my favorite place for Indian food, hands down, in Charlotte.  I have been here too many times to count. I have been here as a party of 2, 4 and 8 on different occasions and I can't remember anything but stellar service. I will say that most of the wait staff may recognize me or even know me by now.  Our waiter usually makes suggestions and guides us through the menu based on what we are looking for that evening.  I have never had a bad meal here, but I do usually get the Vindaloo and I am up to 5 out of 5 spicy.   I really need to try different things on the menu for myself, but the wife and I usually get a vegetarian dish to share and each get a meat/protein entree, so I at least get to try hers. Always got to get naan bread to pick up all the sauces that come with the entrees and they give you all the rice that you need for the table.  We usually have enough left over from everything for at least lunch the next day.  I highly recommend Blue Taj for anyone looking for an Indian food fix."}
{"text":"Great selection and quality of Indian food. Yet on the weekends it becomes a family fun house v.s. a peaceful place to have conversation. This is not a daycare people, please be respectful with your wild misbehaved children and respect that people want to have conversation at their own tables."}
{"text":"Blue Taj is located in the Ballantyne Village, where everything is shiny and new.  Sister restaurant to Copper,  beautiful space, great service and an expensive menu.  The restaurant is divided into sections, one is dark with pink and orange sheer curtains, a small dining room off to the side has stark white tables with blue chairs and tiny blue glass bread plates, the dining room in the back is dark wood with green chairs and green glass plates.  I thought about changing some plates around, but decided not to aggravate the nice waiters.  Service is stellar and very pleasant.  I think the great service is going to carry them.  The food is very good, I am so bad, I ordered the chicken tikka masala, just like I order at Copper!  It is so yummy.  If you like heat, make sure you remember to tell them spicy.  I think it is pretty tame unless you specify!"}
{"text":"I went with four other co-workers to try this place out at lunch.  We arrived at around 12:30.  First off, when we arrived, the lady at the front was working on ringing up some checks she looked up & told us she would be right with us.    We thought it was a bit odd that she left us all standing there awkardly while she continued to ring up at least 5 checks.  Tick-tock, tick-tock... we felt our lunch hour creeping by as we waited to be seated.  There were plently of available tables, so that wasn't the problem...  but, finally we got seated.   I tried the tomato-coconut soup, which was good... but as Todd points out, if you end up getting the chicken tikka masla, the flavors are much the same. It would have been good to have another selection for the soup.   I did order the chicken tikka masala which comes with a little side serving of vegetables (in a separate bowl) that looked a little mushy and over-cooked, but actually tasted good.   The basmati rice was served in big bowls for everyone to share.  I thought the chicken tikka masla was average - not the best I have ever had, but not the worst either.   They didn't bring the naan out until our entrees were served. It would have actually been nice to get that up front along with the soup/salad course. The naan was delicious -  hot,fresh, and tasty.   At the end of our meal, they brought out a rice pudding for everyone. It was tasty but by this time, I think everyone was really too full to enjoy it.   The biggest problem during our entire visit was the slow and sluggish service.  Also, we were not pleased that our waiter brought out one check.  When we asked for separate checks, he was too lazy to do it properly and asked if he could just split it 5 ways. I didn't really appreciate that, but went along with it just to get out of there.   Overall, I thought the food was pretty good but found the service to be sub-par."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to spots in Charlotte.  You cannot miss with any item.  The waitstaff will take the time to explain everything too.  Try some of the special drinks and have the appetizer platter to start."}
{"text":"My mom had recommended we try this restaurant while I was visiting.  Now, I must go to Blue Taj whenever I am visiting Charlotte.  The food is amazing.  You can order the dishes in the spice level that is personally preferred.  The cauliflower appetizer is delicious.  I had never had anything like it.  The sauce is so flavorful and full of dimension.  The chicken tikka masala is the best I have ever had.  I order it at the spice level 3- which is spicy yet tolerable.  The garlic naan is the best to soak up the leftover sauce.  It has diced garlic on it to add more flavor to the already flavorful meal.  I do not think anything ordered would disappoint.  The staff are very friendly, great at suggesting wine pairings, and overall  very genuine.  The atmosphere is casual  with a soothing ambience.  The lighting is dim, there is music playing softly, and the decor is clean and trendy."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful place to try Indian food., its my second time trying indian food and I walked to this place because of yelp!! Such a great service and food!! I tried three different dishes and they were all to the point!! Highly recommend visiting this place if you like indian or other countries food"}
{"text":"Really good! One of my favorites in CLT."}
{"text":"It seems that any time my husband and I want to go out for a date-night dinner, we find ourselves at The Blue Taj.  The food is always delicious and fresh and the service is always good as well.  Although our favorite entree is the chicken tikka masala, we have made a point of trying to venture out and try something new.  We tried the chicken methi curry this weekend and were not disappointed!  Make sure to order a side of garlic naan bread with whatever you order and save some space for dessert!  The homemade Indian ice cream is delicious and so is the kheer."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Their tomato soup was excellent. I also had a chicken dish that was spicey with flavor not just hot. Decor is upscale and lunch is a bargain. If you like authentic Indian food I believe you will make this place a regular lunch stop.  Staff was friendly and place is very clean."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 5 stars. My husband and I are visiting for work and walked in around 9:20. They were so kind and seated us right away.  Our server,Harvin, took such great care of us (heck everyone did).  I asked about Vegan options and they had heaps! I went for vegs in a coconut ginger sauce. Husbae had chicken marsala. Both were delicious!  Like I'll be dreaming about your food good!  Thank you for being so kind serving us delicious food!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Ballantyne is the Blue Taj Indian restaurant.  I've been here several times and each time has been a great experience from the service to the food. If you've never been to an Indian restaurant, it can feel somewhat daunting but here everything is explained in a clear to understand manner on the menu so you know exactly what to expect. You also have the choice of which spice level you're looking for from none to the real deal, I personally prefer the spiciest level and it's delicious.   I'm still learning the menu, so I can't make a good recommendation but the Chicken Methi Curry seems to be my go to choice thus far. The prices are slightly higher than you'd expect but the food is worth it. Definitely, a must go to spot in Ballantyne. The location can be a little hard to find since it located inside of the common shopping area but when you smell the alluring aroma of the curry then you've arrived. Also, the noise level is higher than I expected on the occasions I've gone, so wouldn't recommend this a quiet romantic venue for dinner. However, by far one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food and spread. Delightful dessert! Strange that the buffet was missing Indian daals, and had an  overwhelming number of potato entrees. Good service, overall defiantly  recommend the place again."}
{"text":"Blue Taj has the best Indian food in south Charlotte. The Tikki masala is just spicy enough and the lamb dishes are rock solid. Try the appetizer sampler it won't disappoint. Decent wine list and good bar make this a worthy night out in Ballentyne."}
{"text":"I ended up on the south side for lunch and since Cafe Nirvana does not open on Mondays, I decided to see if all the hype of Blue Taj was legit. I would suggest just parking and asking someone where the restaurant is because you will never find it just driving around.....it's around the corner from Terrace Cafe. I loved the decor of this place and the service was grand. I started out with samosas which were good but I felt that there was an ingredient missing from the actual turnover pastry itself(not that I'm an expert on Indian food:-). I tried the Kerala Style Seafood which was very good, with naan and a salad......again, I felt there was something missing from the naan......I dunno, but I would like to try the Sunday buffet or dinner at some point. Overall, I think I like Copper better."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian Food you will get in Charlotte. The Dal Makhani actually tasted like its from India.  Service is ok.   Would Definitely recommend if you really want to get a taste of authentic Indian taste."}
{"text":"Very nice and balanced Indian cuisine. Everything we tried was very good, especially the land Sagwalla. The Kulfi was very good as well. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice place to enjoy all the flavors of India.  Located right of the parking deck,  there is no need to walk far in this torrential rain. Try the chicken briyani"}
{"text":"Blue Taj is delicious and is my go to Indian restaurant in the Ballantyne area. Food is great, always flavorful, and I really appreciate their vegetarian menu. Yum!"}
{"text":"We tried to Blue Taj a couple of weeks ago since we are planning a trip to India and were inexperienced with Indian food. First, like others had mentioned, the decor is bright and mod and I think it added to the enjoyment of our meal.  But what I really enjoyed was the FOOD!    We had a great waiter, his name is Vikrant (I don't know if I spelled that correctly) and we asked him what we thought we should order. He asked us how spicy we like our food, did we like chicken, fish, beef etc. And then he planned our meal.  I highly recommend this method when going to a place (or traveling) where you are outside your comfort zone.  Waiters know what food is good and they often do a great job with recommendations. We had the chili prawns to start (I don't think they are on the menu) and I couldn't get enough...just spicy enough. Then we had Chicken Tikka Masala--make sure you get some garlic naan to dip into the creamy sauce. And we had a lamb dish which the name escapes me but it was also great.  It was cooked in a tandoori style and very flavorful.  I have been craving the Tikka Masala and Naan (and the chili prawns) ever since and am looking forward to going back.  Vikrant was very friendly and helpful and I would ask for him again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. They let you choose your spice level. So even if you don't like really spicy food you can still enjoy Indian cuisine. I personally like a level 3 or 4.  This restaurant is busy every time I am there. But I am always able to get a table. The staff is amazing and they remember you when you come time after time.  And if you don't know what to order they will help you and they are very knowledgeable and even if you are a first time visitor they make great suggestions!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and I have a lot of friends who rave about this place but I honestly just think it's 3 stars.  The buffet was pretty good (the Baignan Bhara (sp?) was the best choice) but I have yet to find an Indian buffet I love. I honestly just think the buffet isn't for me, especially since I like my food spicier than most. Otherwise the food was good and the service was great and I'm sure I'll be back many times as it's close to home. I still think Copper (their sister restaurant) is better though :-)"}
{"text":"The Blue Taj has been excellent. I have gone to this restaurant several times and is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The service is wonderful. The waiters and hosts are cordial and treat you very well. They help you to make a decision based on what you would like if you're indecisive and will make adjustments to the food/type of meat/level of spiciness as needed. They usually make good recommendations for new things to try and accompanying wine as well. The food is always delicious. The portion sizes are respectable when it comes to your meal. A little small with the appetizers. But the food is consistently flavorful and filling. We usually get some version of chunks of chicken in the various delicious sauces (i.e. Chicken tikka masala), garlic naan, rice and a nice white wine. Between the food and the calm atmosphere it always helps to soothe my day. The service is fast and attentive. I love it! I definitely recommend it if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Indian Food yesterday, and I must say... I'm glad it was at Blue Taj. Not only is the decor warm and comfortable, but the wait staff was above and beyond helpful. As a vegetarian, it was easy for me to tell the server what I did and did not eat and he easily gave me a recommendation. And man was the food aawesome!  My good friend Mo was educating us on the ins and outs of Indian food, including the naan and spice levels. I would gladly go back to Blue Taj and leave my food decision in the hands of the staff. Well done!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing I've eaten a lot of in my life (no, loyal fans, it's not ice cream this time) it's Indian food. This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to, and that includes restaurants actually in India (helpful note: do not eat at any restaurants in India if you ever happen to go there-- jk, why don't you try expanding your cultural horizons, douchebags!). We ordered the lamb kabob dish and it was probably the best meat I have ever had (non-sexually speaking).* The only problem I had with the food was that there wasn't enough of it -- all of the dishes were really, really small, especially for the price.   The service was pretty friendly, as I learned when I was waiting by myself for 15 minutes while my brother and his girlfriend took their sweet ass time getting there after they were looking at a house they might buy (aww they are so cute). Not that I'm going to read too much into this but I think it says a lot about where I'm at in life when my brother is looking for a house with a person he's in a stable relationship with while I'm sitting by myself drinking a beer and pretending to text my friends and then saying fuck it I'm ordering some samosas for myself. Anyway the waiter was really nice and I think he sort of felt bad for me and probably thought I was lying about people meeting me there because he really chatted me up. He told me I should hella move to North Carolina (I swear if one more person tries to get me to move here SO HELP ME-- it's not happening, you guys! I haven't alienated everyone I know in the Bay Area and failed at life out there yet, but when I do, then OK I will consider it.) because he thinks North Carolina is tits or something and also people don't say hella here. My friend James tells me the word hella sounds retarded and that dude speaks with a genuine Southern accent, k? Let's think about that, Bay Area friends.   And just in case someone at Yelp HQ gets a wild hair to make this an ROTD, let me just add that my newest sexual fantasy is to lick the chicken tikka masala sauce from here off of somebody's dick.** OMG my mouth just hella watered.***  *If you can already tell that I need to get laid soon, just keep reading because it gets worse.  **I told you.  ***Also, please do not PM me about this."}
{"text":"Don't call them for reservations.  They have very phone etiquette.  Kept on hold forever.  Hung up on me once.  And then told us us to come at a time that we could only be accommodated on separate tables"}
{"text":"Blue Taj is a classy, upscale but not unaffordable restaurant in the same area as Terrace Cafe. It's a little hard to find because it's tucked away in an alleyway of the shopping center and you can't see it from just walking on the sidewalk - literally a hidden gem. I love that you walk in and the entire eating area is hidden by a dark curtain. It sets you up for a pleasant surprise when you see the awesome decor behind it.   I had the chicken tikka masala for lunch with a friend. It looked a little small but after I was finished, I was absolutely stuffed. The naan bread was to die for and I was ecstatic when the waiter asked us if we wanted more after our bread basket was empty. Also, we weren't too sure what spice was added to the rice but we weren't huge fans of it. But because the spice flavor is drowned out by the tikka masala sauce, I didn't mind it too much.   Lastly, when your done you get a complementary mousse to cleanse your palate. Honestly, it tasted like my friend's room (funnily enough, she's Indian too) - mango and coconuts. If I didn't feel like I was licking the air of her dorm room, then I'm sure I would have loved it haha."}
{"text":"In search of Indian cuisine? It's tucked away next to the elevator...we were driving around the parking lot and ended up calling them to figure out where they were. I'm sure that happens often. (I should have paid closer attention to Todd W.'s review.)  Like others, we were seated in the hallway next to the windows. Had to move because it was too chilly especially whenever someone opened the front or side doors. It was no problem to move.   Great veggie dishes! Delicious rice, flavorful okra dish, and some cheesy dish in red sauce. The garlic naan was a nice touch with the entrees. Definitely order a couple dishes and share because they are very flavorful and may be too much to eat one dish only with the same flavor.   We used a Restaurant.com certificate, which allowed us to choose a variety of dishes and appetizers to try. However, without a certificate it would be too pricey to eat here often. To help justify the price, I figured we're paying for the location, atmosphere, and service.   Enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"Good food was tarnished by horrible service. We were snubbed by our waiter, and the Indian family who was seated about 10 minutes after we ordered our drinks got both their meals AND check before we even finished our dinner. Manager tried to help us out by taking the 2 drinks we ordered, but never got after mentioning 5 times, off the check as well as a discount but the service was so piss poor I should have just walked out without paying. And I've been a waiter, and NEVER done that. Screw that."}
{"text":"My review is based soley on my to-go experience. Vikrum(sp?) was very sweet and offerer great service for me. He gave me wonderful suggestions for both chicken and vegetable options. My food was very good. I decided to do 4 out of 5 on the spice level and as a spice lover I felt it was probably more of 2... I'm hoping to come enjoy a sit down dinner soon. The bar was beautiful."}
{"text":"Great for dining in or takeout. Clean, spacious, indoor and covered patio, great friendly staff, who make you feel like family. The managers all try to get to know you, and really embrace the regulars. Great menu with large, fresh, piping hot portions. They have a good \"heat scale\" so all dishes can be made to your tolerance for Indian spices. Takeout is very easy and always well packaged. Parking is tough due to construction on ramp, but Blue Taj is well worth the short walk."}
{"text":"We live in NYC but were visiting Charlotte.  The food lived up to its reputation.  Very good and well prepared.  The service was OK once we got to the table but they could not seat us within 15 minutes of our reservation and the bar is not really set up for people waiting to be seated.  On warm nights it probably does not matter because people can wait outside the restaurant but it was a bit annoying in the cold.  I would absolutely go back for the food if I am ever in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Just got take out yesterday. Got leek kofta and naan! So good!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but very good Indian food. No complaints.  The bar section is kinda tacky and looks like a storage area with couple of bar stools. Pretty bad use of space. Overall fantastic and lots of innovative cocktails as well."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome and the service was outstanding. The ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five was the place was, for reason, overrun with screaming children even though it was pretty late when we went. The screeching and silverware being banged o or  lobbed off of the tables did detract from the otherwise fabulous atmosphere. The decor is gorgeous!  Our server was extremely good and nice."}
{"text":"Where have we been to have taken so long to find The Blue Taj.  It is cleverly hidden behind the movie theater in the Ballantyne Village shopping center that has the tower thing and Mellow Mushroom.  At the junction of Ballantyne Commons and Hwy 521/Johnson Road.  We went for lunch and here was the conversation with my wife:  wife:  This is wonderful               me:  munch, munch wife:  The naan is exceptional    me:  slurp, slurp wife:  These sauces are delicious and unusual      me:  gobble, gobble glump, glump  To say the least we were very impressed.  This just ain't the chicken curry and tandori chicken joint so regularly found in town.  Taj is classy, serves unusual sauces and combinations that we have not found around. It is pricier, but the unusual offerings make up for the price.    The lunch menu had one choose from appetizers, which included an excellent tomato soup flavored with coconut, and then you could go with an express lunch or regular lunch.  Express offered 5ive sauces, so pick one, then what meat or veggie you wanted with it.  Included were rice (and a decent portion it was), naan (we got a basket with four wedges of it) and dessert.  Other than the express one could choose delicious entres which also came with rice, naan and dessert.  Wife had leek kofta which was croquettes of potatoes and leek with cashew tomato sauce.  Scrumpcious in all respects.  I had the methiwaala korma consisting of chicken chunks in a creamed cashew and onion sauce with fenugreek.  Ummmm...got you with fenugreek, eh?  Fenugreek is a mild form of tarragon.  The sauce was so flavorful that we never found our socks that got knocked off!  It was so flavorful, dotted with little bits of leaves and seeds and spices that each mouthful (amplified with chunks of chicken with rice or naan or all of it together) had your tongue serving as a  dance floor for on which the flavors danced.  When we mentioned this wonderful sauce on checkout, two of the wait staff smiled and hardheadedly agreed that it was also their favorite sauce.  You might not be able to pronounce it, but the wait staff knows what you are asking about.  We concluded that this is the best Indian restaurant we have found to date in Charlotte.  May the search continue, with many stops back into the Blue Taj."}
{"text":"The server was friendly albeit a bit slow when we first got there.  I'm half Irish so the speed at which I get my martini matters.  I'm not sure the girl that brought our water wanted to be there, but the food made up for all this.  We had three different entrees, one of which wasn't on the menu.  The waiter made it very easy to convert their vegetable korma to chicken korma and had the good grace to not look annoyed. I'm an American and can't really comment on the authenticity of the entrees, but I will say they were all delicious and well presented. One of our party wants me to mention that they have Tiger Lager - her favorite Thai beer."}
{"text":"Alright, living not too far from the village, I only saw Blue Taj recently as it's tucked back in what's been a doomed corner.  Ok, a lot of businesses in this center have been doomed by the recession and other factors.  But, Blue Taj is the only restaurant I have seen in this particular space that has been busy - even at 8:30 on a Tuesday evening.  The decor is very nice.  I guess I would label it \"Modern Indian.\"  We sat outside on the small patio with a view of the color-changing fountain.  The colors above us in the patio also changes.  I was almost beginning to imagine that I ingested something I should not have due to all of the changing colors near me :)  The service was mostly good.  We had one main server but at least 4 different people waited on us.  The food was very tasty.  The vegetable samosas appetizer was almost bigger than my entree - actually it was.  That's where there place loses a star.  The chicken tikka masala was a pretty weak portion with no more than 10 small chunks of chicken.  The sauce, however, was flavorful, and the basmati rice was good too.  The naan was also fresh and delicous.  We used a discount from restaurant.com too, which took the sting off the wallet.  I definitely would not pay $15 for the small portion entree I received - no matter how good it tasted.  The presentation was nice, but that will only go so far.  They have a ton of vegetable options, so if you're vegetarian, you will probably like it.  I'll go back again, but maybe for lunch when it's a little cheaper."}
{"text":"I have tried several Indian restaurants in this area severs times incl persis. This a very nice and modern place serving excellent food. Price is about a dollar more expensive  than the others. And at some places you may get poppadoms for free but the food is excellent, the naan absolutely better so overall good experience. Oh, and more chicken in their dishes! I had tikka masala and loved the gravy/sauce. Chicken was perhaps a bit dry but will definitely come back to try another dish!   They also have some new and different dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place in Charlotte.  Consistently outstanding.  I have nothing but positive experiences here.  I frequently phone in an order and pick it up for my staff.  They do a great job of packing the food and it still tastes fantastic by the time I sit down to inhale it.  When I do take the time to eat in, the experience is even better.  I tell everyone who is smart enough to listen that this is the place to go.  Do yourself a tremendous favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Lovely food. Excellent service.  Fourth time at this restaurant and never been disappointed. Food is really tasty and authentic Indian dishes. Can be as spicy as you like. Healthy too - these dishes are rich in flavor but not floating in oil as many Indian meals can be. Take your time and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My wife never liked Indian food until trying Blue Taj. Now, this is her favorite restaurant!  We probably eat here once a week now and I take clients here when they let me pick the place. I'm eating some leftovers from there right now, which is why I'm inclined to write this review.   You will clearly realize that the Tikka Masala is the bomb. We get it with chicken. The naan is perfect and the rice is delicious. At lunch, you get a tomato coconut? bisque (that is my choice every time, even when it is hot outside), naan, and a small dessert for one great price. Go for the 4 spice level - you'll be able to taste it without it being masked by the creamy tikka masala sauce and it's really not that hot. You can use more rice to offset it if you think it's too hot, but I doubt you will. Also, the service is always friendly and helpful. Give it a shot and try my suggestion...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Blue Taj last night.  It was great.  The services was excellent.  The food was excellent. We sat outside  under illuminating wavesof  light blue and red lights covered by a big white split  cylinder shaped cover on the ceiling.  If I were to come back with the kids, I would sit inside so couples could enjoy the romance without little feet.  :) The price was reasonable for what we received.  We really enjoyed the mix of styles , but I was in the mood for indian. Everything was made from scratch, even my chai soda, which was awesome. What we ate: Peri Peri Cauliflower, apricot thyme tandoori bread, Norwegian Salmon, Chiken new deli style (which is the best tikka masala I've had in Charlotte), and a mango moose cake. I wanted Chai tea so they made me some from scratch off the menu.  I really appreciated that touch.  Execellent all around, but if you have something against indian or asian food you probably won't appreciate it."}
{"text":"Service is deplorable. This is high priced Indian food, in a really Nice area of Ballentine and one would expect decent service. Well you won't get decent service here.... I was never quite sure who my actual server was because our table got waited on by three different people, when somebody could be bothered to wait on us.  The staff seem to be more interested in speaking with each other and with customers. The food was decent but still high in price compared to other Indian restaurants in the area, however I don't mind paying a little bit more for fresh food rather than a buffet.  That said, our food was room temperature by the time we finally got and we could never catch servers I just send it back within five minutes after I arrived at our table.  Just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Today for Lunch: Dessert first!  Kulfi: Malai Kulfi: mmmmmmmmmmm.  Last time I had one before the meal and a second one before the entree.  Today I only had one.  Kulfi is a Frozen Indian Dessert and few places in Charlotte have good Kulfi (Copper has Three).    The Blue Taj makes their own (many places do not) and it is Fantastic!!!  This Malai version is: Rich and creamy flavored with Saffron and Rose water.  I'll Guess the other ingredients (Sugar, Almonds, Pistachios, Heavy Cream)?  Fantastic!  Next a Very Special Salad (so special I spell it Zalad) called Kachumber - This is a simple dish with simple ingredients when mixed offer a wonderful experience:  Here's the breakdown of this amazing salad: Cucumbers, Tomatoes, RED Onion (red is a plus for me), Lime juice, Cilantro and a mix of Spices called Chaat Masala.  Chicken Jhalfrazie: Chicken breast and thigh cut into chunks, sauteed with carrots, ginger, onion, red and green bell peppers, simmered in a zesty tomato base sauce.  This is very good and my third time having this dish. It is quite filling served with Basmati rice and Naan bread though not anywhere as heavy as Tikka Masala.  So I think this is a dish many will enjoy especially in the summer.  I prefer the taste of Tikka Masala though the Jhalfrazie is a great dish and change from the usual!  I ordered it medium spice level and it came out perfectly!  Each course was timed perfectly and the service was fantastic!  They remember where I like to sit and ask if I would like the same table I had the last two visits - Amazing!  About half the restaurant was full at lunch time today (a Monday)!  They play so cool Indian Music - all Modern, all upbeat, some Techno - Yeah!!! Today was my 9th Dine at the Blue Taj.  Chicken Tikka Malsa is one of my favorite Dishes (out of ALL Cuisines and Restaurants) and this is one of the BEST!  Tikka Masala is a \"Gateway\" Curry!  Yeah!  Your Sun will be Brighter on the cloudiest day!  Ahhhh!"}
{"text":"I was there for the lunch buffet today and the food was the worst one I ever had in any Indian restaurants. We had to wait with plates in our hand not because there were lot of people it was because they were not refilling the food.. Everything was empty always. I asked for yogurt and the waitress said that she will check and let me know and I didn't even get any response. When I asked her again she said she didn't understand what I asked her for. The sheek Kabab or the lamb curry were empty the whole time I was there... I just have lot of things if I go on keep writing.. Please avoid going there for Indian food.. Sincere advise try somewhere else...!!"}
{"text":"This is not the best of the Mel Oza family of restaurants, but if you can't get up to Copper you should at least come here. Each and every time I step into one of these Indian establishments the quality and variety of the food is top notch, and the flavors are always astounding!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night.  Place was packed on a Friday night, so we ended up sitting outside in a little heated extension the restaurant had added.  Ambience still nice, dark and candlelit.  Ordered chai masala and a mango lassi to start, and both were quite tasty, though the mango lassi could have a been a touch less sweet.  Paneer pakora was our appetizer.  This dish consists of chunks of paneer stuffed with spinach and fried.  It was ok, and the main \"taste\" was that of the mustard (cheese itself was bland).  Had lamb vindaloo, seafood Kerala, and garlic naan for dinner.  Seafood dish was good, and the cream curry sauce was tasty.  Lamb dish tasted like a lamb-filled pasta sauce - almost no kick, even though we asked for a four (out of five) on the spice scale.  Naan was good.  Nice that they included rice for free given that the dishes are quite pricey - we spent $53 before tip for the two of us.  All in all, decent food but overpriced.  Hopefully something better can be found in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"There were empty seats and it took 40 minutes to get drinks and we weren't even able to order food. We kept asking if we could order and they kept telling us the kitchen was too backed up for us to order--but there were a ton of empty tables! An hour and a half later we decided to call it quits and just get the check. It seemed like they were prioritizing take out orders to dine in orders. Worst restaurant experience in my life."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in Charlotte, must get the free soup over the salad its amazing"}
{"text":"Surprised by how delicious I found the food here. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food generally, but perhaps because they toned down the spice for us (you can specify the spice levels) I found myself enjoying the food a lot. I really liked the palak paneer and the chicken tikka masala, which actually had fairly tender pieces of chicken in it. I was a bit disappointed that the much raved about cauliflower dish ended up being not quite as interesting or tasty as I was hoping. But all in all, probably one of the better options for a late dinner in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"The food here was great.  Oddly there menu is very cheap looking compared to the rest of the decor and the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service, and atmosphere!! I wish I lived closer to this gem!  I really enjoyed my dinner here last night- it was a little pricey... But everything was absolutely delicious!! Make sure to try the chicken tikka masala- it was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Yeah, for the food, it's great. However, manager VIC can be a nasty SOB! The owner of Copper also owns Blue Taj. After a very upsetting experience with Vic being SO disrespectful after all the business we gave him, I called Copper and spoke with the manager/owner. We were promised TWICE that they'd send a gift card from Blu Taj (I told them that Vic would NEVER send it). And he didn't. 'Nuff said?"}
{"text":"We were in the area waiting for traffic to clear and saw Blue Taj on a Yelp search. We both love Indian food and decided to give it a try. Glad we did. It was really good.   Despite having the address and Google maps, we couldn't find it. I had to call as we were walking aimlessly around. It's underneath the theater far in the back corner.   Service was prompt and efficient. Not sure it was due to the fact we were there early and the only ones there or if that's typical. We started with the masala-chili cauliflower florets which were quite good. Had better but these were good. The menu is more limited than many other Indian restaurants but adequate. It's also a little pricier than most by a couple bucks per entree. It's rare to see entrées priced at $15-17 but here it's normal.   I had the chicken mehti curry extra spicy and it was quite good with great spice level. My wife had the scallops which were terrific. I'd recommend them.   Atmosphere is cute for a strip mall environment and the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We've wanted to go there since they opened and finally had an opportunity due to a tremendous offer from Restaurant.com.  Blue Taj is located in the back part of Ballantyne Village, where there used to be a pizza place. The interior has been modified to be more Far East themed, but with a modern twist. In particular the space has been carved up into 'rooms', some which work better than others. Unfortunately, for those sitting by windows or outside, the view is of the Ballantyne parking deck and the dry cleaners. . .  Service was inconsistent - long waits for service and food, but interspersed with really positive interactions with our waiter. In particular he was very good in explaining some of the menu options and also upselling the Sunday brunch buffet, which sounds like a great deal ($12.95 pp)!  We ordered a fairly typical Indian meal - Chicken Tika Masala, Saag Paneer, Chicken Vindaloo, Raita and two different Naan's (plain and Pashwari). Overall, the quality of the food is excellent - top notch ingredients, well spiced and not greasy (a common problem with Indian food that isn't prepared carefully). While the standard spice level is mild, if you ask for hot you will get it. I was especially impressed with the Saag Paneer, the cheese was homemade and I'm fairly certain the spinach was fresh.   Regarding the Naan - it was fluffy and crispy, a great contrast. I LOVE Pashwari naan and this didn't disappoint. We did not have desert (opted for frozen yogurt later).   My biggest concern with Blue Taj is the pricing - simply put, the cost per dish is fairly high for what it is and the size of the order. Perhaps I am biased, having eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants throughout the world, but the price points ($13-$16 per dish) seem high given both the market and competing Indian restaurants. I suspect the owners are pricing based on what the market used to bear when the economy was better versus what the reality is today.   As a result, I recommend this restaurant for the occasional date night meal, but not for regular visits or takeout."}
{"text":"Been here few times for dinner and once for buffet, nice place for a date, food taste and portion is good, clean, noticed friendly and attentive service during all my visits... Sunday buffets($30 for 2) are awesome and I am a fan of there pani puri and pav baji...  on the flip side few tables have poor ambiance lighting and hard to even read the menu during dinner ( noticed people on neighboring and our table using mobile torch lights to read the menu).."}
{"text":"How excited am I to have Indian food just down the street from the office?  Pretty dang excited, I'll tell ya.  I'm even more excited that it's good Indian food.  On my first visit, I started with a tomato and coconut bisque.  It was delicious: smooth, creamy, and just the tiniest hint of coconut under the tomato and spices.  It avoided overwhelming sweetness.  For my entree, I had saagwala.  It was tasty: tender lamb and good flavors.  I might order it spicier next time, though.  I specified a \"3,\" and it was pretty mild, although certainly not bad.  The interior is fun as well.  Red and blue contrast and various designs decorate the wallpaper.  The only criticism I have is that the waiter took quite a while to return our check.  He was apologetic when we flagged him down, but when you're on your lunch hour, you notice things like that."}
{"text":"And the search for great Indian fare in Charlotte continues. Chose Blue Taj since it wasn't far from home. The place looked nice enough. And service was friendly. The food? Mehh.  Had the vegetable samosa and Tawa fry to start. I liked the samosa but the Tawa fry was just warm and didn't exactly taste fresh. My lamb vindaloo was decent, the accompanying rice was blah. Needless to say, I wasn't too impressed. On to the next spot."}
{"text":"retroreview from Sept 2015:  went here while visiting my bf in Charlotte because one of his friends said it was the best Indian food ever! SO i went in expecting to be disappointed because come on ...Im indian and a pretty bad ass cook.  But to my shock this place was REALLY good and had unique stuff I'd never seen in any Indian restaurant before.  FIrst and foremost was the fact that it had specialty indian inspired cocktails. If you frequent indian restaurants you'll know that the drinks menu is usually not very extensive if even in existence at all.  So we got two cocktails that were not only good as \"indian cocktails\" but I would truely rate them as some of the best cocktails Iv ever had....sadly I cant rememebr what the were called and even looking back at the menu now they dont have them list! ARGH!! Im starting to sound like an alkey! so ONTO the food dang it... we got chatpate tikki chole as the appetizer, he was skeptical as it was vegetarian....but i told him that doesnt matter with indian food! And boy was i right cuz it was sooo yummy we practically licked the plate.  For dinner we got chicken makhani and lamb curry with some rice and naan. I know boring but it was his first time trying indian food (double gasp!!! - he was dating an indian chick the situation needed to be rectified ASAP). ok back to the food.... it was excellent and very good portions of everything. We had to take some home, mainly so that we could still get dessert ;) We got a tried and trusty Gulab Jamun and it was exact yummy finish that was necessary to such an awesome meal."}
{"text":"The food was overall very good but the chana masala was quite bland.   My overall gripe is that they nickel and dime you for small items. We ordered a samosa appetizer and it came with a very spicy chili chutney. Usually the green and tamarind chutneys come separately.  We requested some tamarind chutney and the waiter finally brought it out. When we got the bill, they had charged $1.99 for a tiny amount of chutney. We complained because the waiter never mentioned there would be an additional charge but he said it was out of his hands. It's a shame...the customer service used to be much better."}
{"text":"If only The Blue Taj were not so far away! My husband and I recently schlepped out to Ballantyne specifically to eat at the Blue Taj because a co-worker recommended it. (Full disclosure: an Indian coworker ... so it carried a little bit more weight.) I am so glad we decided to test it out. It was absolutely worth the drive and the extended time on the babysitter clock.   The biggest shocker of the evening for me was that this restaurant is the sister restaurant to Copper. What? How did I miss the memo? I am not a fan of Copper - too fru-fru for me when I just want good, authentic Indian. The Blue Taj is the answer to that problem. Delicious food. Traditional dishes. Optional spiciness... everything I miss about my favorite Indian restaurants back home in Boston.   We enjoyed everything we ate ... cucumber salad, samosas, naan ... for starters ... chicken tikka masala and a delicious scallop dish for the entrees. We devoured our rice and our server promptly refilled it. Love that. I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for my wife's birthday this month... and it blew our socks off!!!  Everything was cooked to perfection, especially the Saag Paneer and the Chicken Tikka Masala! The staff was awesome, and this has become our favorite spot in he area!  It can be a bit 'swanky' - something we don't really like (but I guess it's part of this  area of Charlotte). Regardless, the food is top-notch!"}
{"text":"Updated review...this restaurant isn't quite up to its own standard.  The service has fallen and the food quality isn't what it once was.  Remains a decent option but only 3/5 stars now."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night. Enjoyed everything we ordered from the slow simmered lamb in tomato paste/ sauce to the chicken maysala. The garlic naan was also delicious. This restaurant had a cozy comforting feel to it-dark intimate and trendy. Will return again!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday not realizing it was a buffet. We asked to look at a menu and was argued with about the reason for this request. The service continued to be subpar throughout the experience. From just apathetic to being severely rude.   That being said, we did decide to try the buffet and it was absolutely delicious. Tasted very fresh and flavorful.   It's a shame that the service didn't meet up to the quality of food."}
{"text":"If not the Queen City's classiest, Blue Taj is without question one of the city's hippest Indian eateries to date. Its coolly lit, swanky-modern interior but echoes the style and panache associated with Ballantyne Village, in which the restaurant resides.  For some, prices may be BT's Achilles' heel. A dining experience smooth and polished as the restaurant offers justifies comparatively premium costs, but whether or not menu items admittedly simple in nature like their 'Masala-Chili Cauliflower Florets' or 'Mustard Tawa Lamb' need require a $5 or $9 decrease in one's wallet, respectively, is understandably debatable.  It must be affirmed, however, that food taste and quality are consistently outstanding. Though non-appetizers offered below $10 are virtually non-existent, both lunch and dinner menu selections are more than substantial [despite opposing reviews]. Looking past the $13-20+ price range, nothing disappoints... each and every dish utilizes a considerably more robust complex of ingredients compared to those presented by competing Indian restaurants. Moreover, portion sizes are satisfactory.  One aspect worth highlighting is BT's selection of drinks and cocktails. Prices are expectedly high, yet the sheer uniqueness of each drink due to its fusion of traditional Indian herbs and spices far outweighs any initial pangs. Execution has always been flawless, and said reason is why I've swiped too many a card on alcohol alone.  FYI -- (1) the restaurant's front door is situated \"within\" the shopping complex's ground floor... NOT INSIDE, just not on an exterior wall that's visibly seen from the street/parking lot; (2) if there's a wait, fancy cozying yourself up at the bar located to the left upon entering; (3) SUNDAY BUFFET for $30; (4) first-timers beware Ballantyne Village's ever full parking lot at any hour past 4 PM... if need be, a garage is available.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.25 - Food taste and quality = 5 - Portion size = 3.75 - Price = 2.75 - Atmosphere = 5 - General service = 4 - Waitstaff = 4.5 - Location = 5"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Decent value. Nothing remarkable or innovative on the menu although the variety on the menu makes each visit worthwhile."}
{"text":"One of the best indian foods I had in the US. Undoubtedly best gol gappa in the US. We went for Sunday buffet which was quite detailed and amazingly tasty. All the dishes were delicious.  I heard the similar reviews from other friends who went for dinner at this place. 5 star for food!!! Ambience is also trendy along with soothing music.  Service is not that good as I felt they are short of people.  That's why I gave overall 4.5 star to this place."}
{"text":"Tonight's meal was mediocre at best  This is the third and probably last time for me and my family.  I have never been wowed yet and truly wonder if most of the positive opinions of this place are based on uneducated palates or I have been unlucky each visit."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Great Ambiance, Unique Dining experience with 3 separate dining rooms.  The owners are wonderful people and the staff is very knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend  The Blue Taj to anyone who loves Indian cuisine or is an adventurist in there cultural dining endeavors."}
{"text":"Superb chicken tikka masala. Highly recommend the vegetarian app platter. Service was fast and friendly. Will be back if in Charlotte area again!"}
{"text":"Great takeout for dinner tonight. The scallop nilgiri kurma is delicious. I also had the garlic naan which on its own was a little bland but great for dipping into the curry sauce from my meal."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Blue Taj.  Saturday night was very busy and very noisy.  Service was sporadic.  The prices were too high for what you got:  the seafood curry dish and the vegetarian lentil balls with peas dish were mostly sauce with little else.  We'll not go back."}
{"text":"The Blue Taj is my favorite Indian restaurant by far. Start with their Malai ka Jhinga (jumbo prawns) or Samosas (baked pastry with filling). I like the Naan too (flat bread). The Chicken Tikka Masala is a great entree. Try \"Indian hot\" if you want a bit of a kick. Their friendly staff remembers me and always makes me feel welcome. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Cuisine in Charlotte!  For starters-you have to try the Masala Chicken Cauliflower (vegetarian, but so full of flavor you won't believe it's cauliflower...), and the Assorted NON-Vegetarian platter. The flavors of the grilled meats are OUT OF THIS WORLD. You'll be drooling about the dish every time you think about it in the future, I promise!   I have tried SO MANY of their dishes, as I always go with a group and share. My favorite? The Kerala Style Seafood-Jumbo prawns, scallops and fish stewed in a Kerala style curry sauce with coconut, spices and tamarind. So creamy, the seafood is so moist, the flavors robust... a nice heat and a little bit of sweet lingers in the background... this dish does NOT disappoint! I am pretty sure I have dreams abou this dish, I wish I could replicate it in my kitchen!! The first time I ordered, I got a 3. It was a WARM 3. The second time I ordered, I got a 2. It was a WARM 2. So-depending on how \"warm\" you like your curry, be warned.   The next favorite is an oldie but goodie, the Chicken Tikka Masala-which you can never go wrong with. Creamy & tangy curry goodness surrounding extremely tender chicken that will keep you going \"mmmmmmmmmm\" all night!  The best part about Blue Taj-is that if you have no idea what to order, your server will order you the perfect dish. Just ask for help-tell them what meat you want and flavors you know you like-or think you like-and they'll take it from there.   Don't forget the garlic Naan!  Great for groups-but you better be sure you call ahead or you'll be waiting quite a while. Take a group of your friends and share-it's the most fun AND you get to taste EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Back again. So good I wished they delivered hint hint. Try the desserts different but very good."}
{"text":"It was recommended to us as a really good indian food restaurant, and we were not disappointed. We have visited the restaurant now quite a few times for lunch and dinner, as well as takeout. Food is always fresh and delicious. I love going there for a lunch special they offer during the week.   Why not five stars? Complimentary naan for eat in clients would be nice. At least for dinner."}
{"text":"This place serves authentic Indian food with sophistication. Our plates were really well done. The chefs have outdone themselves ... Truly! We ordered the Veg Assorted Taste Platter for starters, Paneer Tikka Masala and Dal Makhani with Aloo paneer kulcha for main-course, and Gulab Jamun and Malai Kulfi for dessert. Each and every dish was spot-on and service was pretty good too. In all, a great experience."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying as a cuisine overall, I am not a huge fan of Indian food.  However, when go with a group and two of your friends are LITERALLY from India and they are ordering for you based on your tastes, you get to try some new things.  I hesitate to say this, but I actually enjoyed my dinner (don't tell my friend who for years, had to listen to me say how much I hate Indian food).  I ordered a glass of Pino Noir.  Pretty solid wine for $9.  Everyone else ordered an Indian beer that came in a huge bottle.  The cold glasses for them were a nice touch.  We had a bunch of apps, from cauliflower to a spicy shrimp/veggie dish to samosas.  The samosas came two to a plate and were shareable.  Next for dinner, I had a chicken dish that came in a bowl with a ton of sauce.  I am pretty sure it was the Chicken Makhani, which was more of a tomato based sauce.  Paired with rice and naan, it was delicious.  The most unique item was the cherry naan.  I would recommend this place to anyone just looking for good Indian Food...period.  They have a good size patio outside, and nice decor inside.  I'm not going to full on say that I love Indian food now, but Blue Taj has certainly changed my mind."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and this is by far the best I've ever had.  Definitely try the Chicken Tika Masala"}
{"text":"OMG.....simply delicious food!!!  A must for Indian fare if one is looking for such cuisine in the Charlotte area. Excellent and friendly service. Mary L. St Augustine,  Fl"}
{"text":"Good food , but certainly alterations to the spices may be more for people who cannot handle the authentic Indian spices.."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian Cuisine in Charlotte. It's one the place where you can take your date and know she will like it. Decor is very modern and the food has very good flavor to it.  The service was just as good.  They are all so pleasant and helpful.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go to The Blue Taj for over a month..the first time we couldnt make it because of the snow fall in Charlotte. Last night we went..I wish it would have snowed! The atmosphere is eclectic Indian, thats is interesting, the menu online looks good, so we ventured off to try it. When we sat down we were served an \"Amus Bouche\" It is just a one bite little appertif. It was the tinest speck of pear with a golden raisin and a sprinkle of curry powder on top...Okay...not anything spectacular. We started with Appetizers, My husband had the Wok Stir Fried Filet with Peppers and  I had the Tomato Coconut Bisque. The soup was the best item of the whole night! I wish I would have had three bowls of it. My husbands stir fried filet was good and spicey but for 13.00 it was less than  1 ounce of meat. We went on to order our entrees. I chose the Lemon Chive Corvina with Leek and Wild Mushroom Stew. My husband had the Scallops Sczhuean Peppercorn Sofrito with Chinatown Green beans. My fish was a flat filet, no lemon chive sauce on it, I called the waiter over and asked him what kind of fish was this..it did not look nor taste like Corvina..he said..\"Oh no we cant get Corvina so that is Halibut!\" Nice of them to tell me before I ordered...It was dry and tasteless, I asked for a chutney or sauce, the waiter said sure, He brought me a bottle of Sriracha Hot Sauce. As far as the mushroom stew..there may have been Mushroom broth underneath the fish, but I saw nor tasted no mushrooms. My husbands Scallops were okay, 4 med, no flavored scallops...The meal for four of us ( the other couple had almost identical items as us) with Two glasses of wine apiece came to 204. Not worth have of that....I was so very disappointed, and hungry when I left...Just not the fusion cuisine that they advertise...No flavor...anywhere...Save your money..dont go there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down, the best Indian food in Charlotte. Love the waiters, they know us by name. The beer selection is wonderful. Our favourite waiter even lets us order stuff that's not on the menu. We love Indian and know a lot of their dishes that sometimes you can't find in America. Everything about this place is great. Atmosphere, bar, food, service... Just love it! Now I'm craving it..."}
{"text":"By far mine and the hubs favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte. We eat here pretty much every weekend. Here's what we normally order: -Kachumber Salad -Tossed house salad -Seared Tawa Salmon (salmon and roasted veggies with an amazing creamy red sauce which I normally order on the side. They have a tendency to slightly overcook the salmon so you may ask for it a little more rare if that will bother you.) you can also do this dish with scallops which are great too. -Chicken Methi Korma (2 spice level) -vegetable korma (sometimes we order this) -garlic naan -or the naan with potato inside  Great food and great prices. Service is usually pretty good depending on your server. Sometimes things can lag a bit. The chairs are a bit noisy which can get annoying if you arrive early and you have to listen to the place fill up with patrons. With that said, the beautiful decor, great food, and great prices should be more than enough to keep you coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I was in town and needed to carry out food for a family gathering. My girlfriend recommended this place to me. The food was great! We ordered the food (about 10 dishes) and they were all ready to be picked up in a hour. We ordered Panner tikka, daal and saag. They were all good, the panner tikka was everyone's FAV. Looking forward to going back there when I am in the area."}
{"text":"First time here. Wow what fantastic food! Great service and excellent food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Spice levels are good.  They must start having Buffets on weekdays too!"}
{"text":"The Blue Taj serves Americanized, dumbed-down, Indian food without the characteristic spices.  For a Wednesday night, service was really slow and inattentive.  I started with a shrimp appetizer that wasn't on the menu.  It was drowned in this super oily red sauce that tasted like Ragu pasta sauce from the jar, but really oily.  For the entree, I had a lamb dish that was way too creamy and lacked the distinct Indian spices.  The worst part: the lamb didn't taste like lamb at all.  It sort of tasted like dried beef cubes.    I wanted to try a new place, which is why I came here.  Now I know that Bombay Grille in Pineville and Saffron at Arysley are two of the better places in Charlotte, for Indian food."}
{"text":"This was our first time at The Blue Taj. We made reservations so there was no wait. The food was amazing. The rice was so fragrant and the garlic naan is a must have if you dine here. I could eat it with nothing else. The only reason I didn't give five stars is the service is a little slow. I don't know if it's because they were so busy or if they were understaffed.  I can definitely deal with the slightly slow service in order have the amazing food again. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First thing they get is an attitude when I get in and say I don't have a reservation. The place was empty on a Tuesday.   Second, I blew out the candle at my table because it was giving me a headache. Someone rushes over grabs and with a forced polite notion \"you don't want this?\" And let's out a heavy sigh in disappointment as if I dropped a $15 dish.   Third, I asked for a bag  for my to-go boxes. He doesn't look at me as he keys in the order and say these words with pure irate: \"please go back to your seat. We're very busy! You should have asked for it when you asked for boxes.\"   They also added a mandatory gratuity for 5 people. Pretty sure gratuity is charged with parties of 6-8 or more.   This was all tonight, but for the record NEVER cater from these guys. They forgot the deserts and half the guests didn't get any. The food was cold. The naan wasn't fast enough for people. Their food is good in house. Don't cater from here."}
{"text":"Again, I and so many folks I know agree that the Blue Taj is at the top of the list for authentic, delicious Indian dining. Very cute place and outdoor patio that is covered. I've only had one disappointment there, and it was recently. I had to use the lady's room for the first time there and found myself in an unkempt, dingy, dirty room that was gross to use. How easy and inexpensive it would be to upgrade the bathroom, make it cheerful, clean the stalls (and toilets!). I was not able to continue eating my dinner after using the room. Had it wrapped up for another day. Such a nice looking restaurant with excellent food and service, a dirty icky bathroom that doesn't even live up to some of the roadside rest stops can affect business. Some cheerful colors, décor & a cleaning person would do wonders to keep this place on top Maybe most men don't care about these things, but most women do."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since Sweetie and I ate at the Blue Taj.  We had an impromptu date night come up and scrambled for a place to dine on a Friday night in Ballantyne.  We crashed and burned on our first choice and thought about The Blue Taj.  Ballantyne Village was hoppin and we didn't think we'd get in on this chilly night.  We walked in and were asked if we had the dreaded reservation.  I pretty much figured we were going to have to drive down to Showmars at this point but were ushered to their outdoor seating area which was awesome.  They had these heaters on and it was like we were dining in Tahiti!!!  We started off with the vegetarian appetizers which had samosas and other stuff that I couldn't really identify but they were all good.  They had a homemade sauce served with them which couldn't have had any more flavor!  YUM.  I had a lamb dish suggested by our waiter which was both full of flavor and had just the right amount of heat.  Sweetie had a shrimp dish that she enjoyed also.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the dishes, but just going off the recommendations of the waiter we did really well.  Oh, I forgot the NAAN, holy crap get the Garlic Naan.    Service was a team effort and we stayed taken care of the entire night.    Great experience and We'll add The Blue Taj back into the rotation"}
{"text":"Fancy Indian cuisine in the heart of Charlotte. Very classy atmosphere and the food was absolutely tasty. We only ordered appetizers and drinks, all of it was absolutely perfect portions and was shareable with 4 people. I highly recommend this place when you are in the Balantyne area of Charlotte."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to The Blue Taj and reading the reviews and ratings, I'd say I was disappointed by both the food and service.  We ordered a veg appetizer plate, which I think was the best thing we had that night (except for the paneer pakoras). The quality of Paneer used was below par. It was dry and hard, not the type of quality you expect from a such a fine dining restaurant ! I was worried as I had already ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala for our entree and onion paneer naan bread and the quality of paneer was the same in both. To add to our woes, it was bland ! The cocktail drink we ordered with our appetizer took ages and finally I asked the waiter to cancel it.  Il not recommend anyone to come here considering  the price we paid for our experience !"}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at Blue Taj and chose some menu items I wouldn't normally order. I had a variety of spicy and traditional dishes as both appetizers and my main course & LOVED everything including the service. I will definitely be back many times to enjoy the ethnic decor, good service & delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. Great meal and service. Just enough food for lunch and even got to bring a little home. Rice and bread were plentiful and full of taste. Definetly going back to this one. We had the chicken methi curry which was very good and another chicken that was in a spinach sauce that was very good - the two complimented each other well."}
{"text":"Unexpected flavors. Wonderful service. I'm not a big fan of Indian food but they definately showed me what a great Indian meal can be. The Naan with garlic and butter was to die for. The meal (veggies in some type of cream cashew sauce) was delightful. The host helped guide me and he was a joy. The dessert was a sampler with some type of mango pudding, a frozen spicy dome (my least favorite), rice pudding and a \"donut.\" I am so glad for the experience. The ambiance was warm, friendly and relaxing. There was outdoor seating and a band was playing. Too loud for my tastes but others might love it."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience. Great service. Stupendous food. You wont hit upon better Indian food or a better Indian restaurant in the greater charlotte area. Right from when you walk in--the decor, the ambience ---to the delectable desserts at the end---everything seems to hit the right note. Personal favorite- vegetarian taste platter----assortment of vegetarian appetizers--each better than the others--in one word-delicious. Also....chicken tikka masala...highly recommended. And do not skip desert....they look fantastic and taste even better. Haven't tried the weekend buffet yet...have heard great things about that though....will check it out soon."}
{"text":"Baby sister of the restaurant Copper. Terrific Indian food. Tiki masala is bar none  delicious garlic naan. Can't say enough good things about this place. It and copper are the go to Indian spots in Charlotte"}
{"text":"We relocated from the Bay Area and this is our favorite spot in our new home so far.  Authentic food, perfect service and great atmosphere.  If the chili chicken appetizer doesn't top your list of all-time favorite Indian offerings, we need to talk.  Not a loser on the menu.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant and the food was amazing!   Timing for cocktails and appetizers was a little off.  Next time I will make sure to order them separately.   Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to go this place because it's very close to my house and I was in the mood for Indian food and didn't want to make the trek to Saffron.  OMG!  Most menus at Indian restaurants are the same--you won't find too many varying entrees to choose from, but still, the Paneer Tikka Masala (I think that's the name) was out of this world.  I've gone back a few times since and have nothing but positive things to say about the staff and the restaurant overall.  This is a great place to get some solid Indian food at a pretty decent price."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Charlotte for connaisseur and the 1st timer!  Wait staff is outstanding. They will always help you with the choices and if it's your 1st time expect them to take care of you.    The cauliflower app is a great starter and the tomato based soup is a must for my boyfriend every time.   Like most Indian restaurants, if you want it spicy, you will want to emphasize that.   Beer and wine menu pretty decent.   Everything I've had on the menu is good...and if you want a recommendation they will not disappoint. Often times offering to \"make\" me something that they will \"guarantee\" that I will like!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food we've had since we moved here! I got the chicken tikka masala and my fiancé got the goat curry. They were both delicious. We split the dessert sampler (it was my birthday!) which was amazing - recommend the mango mousse!our waiter was very pleasant and never made us feel rushed. Will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"We've always had a special spot for this place.   The owner is very friendly and accodomates all requests at any given time. The food is exceptionally best! We've been here for lunch as well as dinner, both times the food and customer service has been one of a kind. This is hands down our best place to goto for aunthatic Indian food. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing. My kids are always treated special when we dine here. We simply love this place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Indian restaurants in Charlotte. Very pleasant dining rooms, super quick service and delicious authentic food. Conveniently located in the same building as the movie theater in Ballantyne Village. There is a large parking ramp right beside the building so parking is convenient to. My husband loves the chicken masala and I like the Saag Paneer creamed spinach and cheese. You can choose the spiciness of your food. The tomato soup is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is good but I can't find it. I tried going about 2 years ago and we drove all over that \"village\" and never found it. I tried again today, couldn't find it so I called them. The girl that answered was no help. I'll have to go with a local one time. Maybe they can find it.  MAybe add a sign somewhere."}
{"text":"the food here is phenomenal... I honestly felt like I was going to explode like Mr. Creosote from Monty Python's \"The Meaning of Life\"  Everything on the menu is good...how's that for a review?  Seriously. We ordered probably 8 different dishes tonight between appetizers and entrees and everything was superb."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We had not planned on eating here this evening, but decided to give it a try. We were so pleasantly surprised!! The nan bread is so good and we tried different variations of the lamb and chicken. So we asked for 3 out 5 for slice level and it had some heat!  Whooo!  Very good and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had mixed feelings here, so I'll break it down:   Atmosphere: 5 Very cool place. Lighting very moody. Walls painted funky, drapes hanging everywhere, very cozy. They've done well with a small space.   Service: 3.5 Our server was very nice and attentive. The hostess seemed entirely uninterested in helping us however so we waited a while before she even spoke to us, kinda strange since we were standing right in front of her.   Appetizers: 3 Your standard indian appetizers, nothing special.   Main course: 3 We ordered 2 dishes. They were unmemorable and made us regret spending as much as we did for the meal overall. Just very uninspired cooking and not as flavorful as most other places we've been.   Probably will give it one more shot simply because it's a great vibe, but the food needs to hit the mark next time or we're done with them."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors as always.  The kerala style seafood is wow.  So good that I have ordered it at least 10 times and can't bring myself to get anything else.   That said,  when you order something so many times it is easy to notice if something has changed.   The last two times there was very little seafood in it and it was mostly sauce.   This was the least so far.   One scallop that was cut in half and two smallish shrimp and two very small one inch  pieces of salmon.  Given the price it was a problem, especially since it wasn't the first time.  My daughters goat and husband's chicken were more reasonably sized.   Four stars still for flavor though.  We ordered 5 on the spice scale.   We love spicy.  Mine was very spicy but perfect.   My husband's was very very hot and he was almost crying.   So beware!   We got what we asked for but might go for 4 next time."}
{"text":"Our preferred CLT spot for chicken tikka masala and vegetable samosas (with the noted exception of Passage to India, though that's clear across town). The waitstaff at BT is friendly and generally pretty good, though one of our usual servers regularly tends to be a little overconfident about remembering orders and sometimes has to come back to reconfirm (just write it down!). Definitely worth checking out if you're in Ballantyne. Both indoor and outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"This is the worst and unethical business I have ever experienced. They quote you different price when you place a carry out order and charge you double the amount taking advantage of your situation."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice, however this place is overrated & over-priced.  I have had much better Indian food at other places in Charlotte.  The service is okay but not the best.  Unless I was in the area and craving Indian food, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here to eat."}
{"text":"Perfect! My GF and I went there last night Saturday, reservations for 6:30pm. They were ready and had our table set! Very friendly greeting and even told us where there was a secret elevator that would bring us up to the restaurant door next time. Our waiter was extremely nice, smart, funny, and attentive, regardless how busy he was. Our table was intimate and warm. Prices are perfect for a nice night out without breaking the bank. Food was out of this world! We had the fried-ish cauliflowe for an appetizer... excellent. Main course was braised Lamb and a Chicken Tikka Masala with a coconut sauce. To die for!!!! Definitely recommend, and WILL be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Taj on several occasions and it is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Charlotte.   This is a great spot for a date night. The funky coloring and design inside makes for a trendy environment. Everything I have eaten here has been delicious.  This last trip we tried the non-vegetarian appetizer platter that had a selection of tandoori meats. Everything on that platter reflected the wonderful light smoky flavor associated with the tandoori.   This time I decided to branch out and I ordered the tawa scallops and the waitress was kind enough to suggest the sauce pairing. The scallops were light and amazing! It was great to find such subtle flavor especially for someone like me who is still a novice with many of the spices used in Indian cuisine.  The other dish I usually get here is the chicken tikka masala which is the best I have found in Charlotte. The kitchen also has some great variety of naans if you order off the menu.   The experience here has always been great but I can't quite justify 5 stars for the price. You could order one chicken or vegetarian dish and a side of naan and be out over $20 before drinks."}
{"text":"I was in here the other day for lunch with a friend.  We were there a little later so the place really wasn't that full.  I decided on the chicken tikka masala and asked for it hot.  I also went with the tomato bisque soup.  My friend got the vegetable korma (hot) with the tomato bisque as well.    We both thought the bisque was really good, no complaints!  The tikka masala and vegetable korma were both really good as well.  It's some of the best Indian food I've had in a long time.  I put would it up there with Copper as my two favorite Indian restaurants.    Both entrees with soup and naan were $9 each.  Not too pricey for lunch in my opinion.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time dining here. The food was fantastic and very affordable. Service wasn't bad, but not perfect either. There is a large selection of authentic Indian cuisine; which is nice to find in an area like Ballantyne. I ordered a cucumber salad, garlic naan, and Chana Masala. All were delicious. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The Blue Taj is perhaps the best looking restaurant (Indian or not) in all of Charlotte. You go inside and the music, the curtains and everything transports you elsewhere. Don't get me wrong - I love the food at Woodlands, but it doesn't exactly transport you. I totally get that there are parts of the world, in Charlotte, India and elsewhere, that are total dives, and I have no problem with that. But for those who have a desire to go somewhere else when you dine, this has to be at or near the top of your list. Copper is right up there too, but where they are elegant, Blue Taj is more magical - like you expect Aladdin to come out and take you on a magic carpet ride (and not the LSD sort). Pretty neat trick being that you're in a strip mall near Ballantyne.  Service is generally friendly - though it pales a bit in comparison to the atmosphere. I mean really, what wouldn't? They do keep the glasses filled, though it service tapers off. I don't know if this is an Asian thing, as several other Indian-type places (Situl, Woodlands come to mind) in Charlotte just forget about you later in the meal. Maybe it's cultural.  As to the food: Very solid offerings. It's not the best I've had in town, but far from the worst. Like much of the Chinese that you'll find around, it does have a tendency to be a bit heavy on the sauce - though instead of the sweetness of the Chinese variety, it's just a thick sauce that can be on the spicy side if you order it that way.  Perfectly serviceable option, and well worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"I don't see what people find good in this restaurant. Food isn't bad, but isn't anything different. It's really average and nothing that I've ever had here is worth a mention. The serving sizes are so small for the price, when they brought out the appetizers, I almost thought it was a joke! The interiors are okay, and are very un-Indian, so it feels different, rather than having Indian style art everywhere. I was impressed the first time I walked in. It feels like you are in a French restaurant or something. The last time I ate here, we wanted to sit outside because the weather was good. But we regretted our decision owing to their lights. I don't know who designed the place but the continuous yellow-red-green-blue lights are completely unnecessary. This is a restaurant, not a discotheque, you know! Another problem I have is with how snotty these guys are. I once dropped by 15 minutes before closing time and all I wanted was a drink (chai or soda, not a fancy drink), but the guy at the counter told me they were closed. Come on, there's still 15 minutes, what's the whole deal with making a chai? I'm Indian and I know how much effort it takes! Given the average taste of the food which is typical of Indian restaurants in the US, I wouldn't bother going out of my way for this place. I'd much rather pick up food from Bollywood Bites or just make it myself. It's just as good."}
{"text":"I had a really positive experience here. Came here with a friend. We didn't have reservations and we didn't have to wait long at all. The service and food was excellent. I got the chicken tikka masala and it was the right amount of spice. The flavor was good and I had a good amount of chicken. I also got the garlic naan and it was fresh and soft. I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. The food is absolutely delicious and if you aren't familiar with Indian food then every server can help recommend something for you according to your tastes. Even when they are busy, we never have to wait longer than 10 minutes and then after we order our food comes out promptly. The ambiance is great for a date or business dinner but I probably wouldn't take kids here."}
{"text":"Soooo... I came here thinking they had a lunch buffet during the weekend. I was wrong- only on Sundays. But.... I've never been so glad that I was wrong! It was such a good dining experience.  First off, this restaurant is so cute inside and has a great lunch OR dinner date vibe. I could take my mom here for post shopping lunch or my husband for a romantic dinner.   Second, the service is fantastic. The hostess greeted us warmly and seated us right away. Our water was constantly being refilled as soon as levels were low. Our waiter was very kind and helpful.   Third, the lunch is a great value! You get a salad or soup to start. I had the salad, it came with a mango dressing that was Devine. Then you get your choice of meat with your choice of sauce. I had the chicken tikka masala and it was fantastic. My mom had the curry goat and it was so tender. You receive a generous basket of naan with your meal. To finish it off, you get a dessert. I had rice pudding and my mom had a mango mousse. My meal was $10 and my mothers was $11. What a great deal!  I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Tucked behind Terrace Cafe, this place may be a little hard to find in Ballantyne Village.  But once you step in, you're glad you did.  The ambiance was quite nice, dimly lit and cozy, good for romantic dates or a small group.  I had the Tandoori Lamb Kahari which was very tasty and nice chunks of meat.  I wish it had more of a sauce to spread across the rice or naan, but a good tip is to share with someone who has a curry or saucy entree to get the best of both worlds.  The garlic naan was great, warm and flavorful.  I could eat this all day.  This was my first visit and was happy with the little I tried. The menu is plentiful and I would like to try more of it. It's a little pricey but great for some good ethnic diversity in this area."}
{"text":"Okay food. Order Paneer Tikka and it was filled with red color. Waiter said it's tomato but it was not.  Not authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Well worth the Ballantyne price.  The Naan was perfectly warm and the service was fantastic. Already want to go back!"}
{"text":"Holy lunch deal, Batman!  In an ornately dressed and dimly lit space, Blue Taj offers up a lunch special that is not to be missed! $9 for your choice of salad or soup, entree, rice and naan! And the best part is that it's super delicious and comes out fairly quickly - perfect for a work lunch! Here's how it went down...  1) Salad: 3/5: A small serving of bright greens with a strange but flavorful strawberry dressing. The dressing was a bit a la strawberry smoothie, but good nonetheless.  2) Chicken Tikka Masala: 5/5: Spicy, rich and creamy. Perfect with the complimentary rice. The big chunks of chicken are delightful and the sauce is filled with tons of flavor. Spice level three was a nice amount of heat, but nothing to set a fire to my mouth.   3) Naan: 4/5: Yeeeeah free naan. Four triangles between my dining partner and I. And it went very well with the tikka masala.   One other note...if you're headed to the restroom, be careful going around that corner! I almost smacked right into a server carrying a very full tray of eats. Moral of the story - hit up Blue Taj for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch."}
{"text":"Blue Taj has amazing food in a unique atmosphere. The wait staff has great suggestions, like when to get sauce on the side etc. If you don't know Indian cuisine then tell them the protein you like and they'll help you. The cauliflower appetizer is beyond amazing. It's a crispy cauliflower with a red chili sauce. They offer take out if you don't have time to sit down."}
{"text":"Last night was my third time at Blue Taj.  My only reference for Indian in Charlotte is Woodlands and Jaipur.  I convinced a few friends to drive down with me from Plaza-Midwood because I think Blue Taj is worth it.    We had the Paneer Pakora, Punjabi Chicken Curry, Lamb Curry and (of course) Chicken Tikka Masala.  I try not to order the Tikka Masala because I want to try new dishes but it is ridiculously good at Blue Taj.  Your entrees are always served with rice but Naan is a little extra.  Worth it though, need the Naan to soak up all that delicious sauce.  My friends poked fun at me for asking about the amount of sauce with the Punjabi - I ordered the Lamb Kadahi previously and it was very light on the sauce, which I should have expected from the menu description.  My boss is vegetarian and loves the Aloo Gobhi.  Also they have Tiger Lager (among some other beers - all bottled).  My only issue with the restaurant is the service.  The staff can be a little rigid and not very friendly.  Its just that they don't really speak very much to you.  Also last night we were slow to be waited on after we initially sat down and towards the end of our meal  couldn't get our water refilled.  From reading other reviews I would say the staff seems to be the biggest problem so maybe they can whip that into shape.  And if you don't really care about a little weirdness from the staff (I don't really) then I've really got nothing but love for Blue Taj."}
{"text":"Coming from DC, I have had my fair share of awesome Indian food. But, Blue Taj knocks all those places out of the water. My hubby and I had a craving and placed a to go order on Doordash. Let me say,  this is hands down the best Indian I have ever had. Chicken tikka masala- divine, cauliflower and potato- amaze, samosas- yum and garlic naan? Yes please!!!  We will for sure be coming back for more. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Given my recent addiction to Indian cuisine lately it was only natural for me to jump at the Restaurant.com special for Blue Taj. I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first since it seemed like a swanky place, and that can sometimes be red flag #1, but also I was concerned because it was tucked back into what Brian F. fittingly dubs the \"doomed corner\" of Ballantyne Village. But this place is nothing close to doomed. Before I get into the dishes we ate and give my recommendations, I'll just cut to the chase and say it: this is the hands-down best Indian food I've eaten in Charlotte.   For our appetizers, my husband ordered the Tomato-Coconut Bisque, which was outstanding. Not being much of a coconut fan I usually don't like when I can taste it too strong in the cooking but there was the perfect amount of it in this soup. I went with the Mango Chickpea Chaat, a starter that was so out-of-this-world I want to make this the next time we have a party. It is a cold appetizer, with mango, potatoes and chickpeas tossed with onions and cilantro in a tangy tamarind-yogurt dressing. It was simple and packed with flavor, and surprisingly priced at $5.    For my entree I went with the Saag Paneer and on behalf of all of my tastebuds, you HAVE to try this dish. It was as if the Indian version of that girl from the Fiat commercial rose up out of the creamed spinach and slapped me in the face with a piece of paneer. Fan-TAS-tic! My husband got the Kolmino Patio, which was jumbo shrimp sauteed with spices and tamrind glaze and ginger. This dish was also great, but we both tried to play it cool as we fought over the Saag Paneer. Both meals came with rice, and we ordered garlic naan for dipping of course.   When we finally put down our forks we were so happy and full that we felt \"food drunk.\" We learned that the owners from Blue Taj also own Copper, which I could not believe - no offense to Copper, but while their food may be \"prettier,\" the taste and quality does not come close to Blue Taj.   Overall it was a great experience and we will be back for sure. The only thing I would do differently is to order only one main dish instead of two, since they definitely do not skimp on the food here."}
{"text":"I  liked this place. Funky decor, good food and accommodating but never annoying staff made this place a find. We shared the Mango Chickpea Chaat appetizer which had a nice full flavor and for dinner had vegetable korma and shahi paneer. The korma was very good, not overly creamy but I preferred the shahi paneer probably because I'm a big fan of Indian cheese plus it had a delicate flavor balancing out the sweet (raisins) with the creamy, delectable sauce.   Just remember to order it according to your liking, i.e., mild, medium, spicy. I was expecting less and got way more than I bargained for in taste, atmosphere, and service."}
{"text":"This really is excellent Indian food and their drink list is the standard fare kind of drinks but with an Indian twist. So don't expect their Mohito to be your traditional Mohito. They spice it up Indian style and it's awesome. The last time I was there as a group of six we asked the waiter just to bring us some food. He was a little surprised and we said that we trusted his judgment and he could surprise us. Unfortunately neither he or the chef were all that creative and what we ended up with was standard fare items from the menu that we probably would've chosen ourselves. We hoped he'd be a little bit more exotic"}
{"text":"We went to Blue Taj after a movie, and I'm glad.  First, there is clever usage of heavy curtains to partition off sections- it creates a very intimate setting to not see the entire restaurant from your seat. I have no idea if there were 20 tables or 200.  The host and hostess at the door were warm and friendly, and our server was engaged as well.  There is an extensive wine list which surprised me, but I just ordered a glass, and my friend ordered a Kingfisher beer. My wine was a generous pour.  We started with a cauliflower app. It was a little more tomato-pasty than I liked, but the textures were varied and it still was pretty good. We also ordered the Cod, Saag Paneer, and garlic naan. We ordered everything medium heat, but it was not really hot at all, so next time I might try at least one dish hotter.  The naan was very good- warm and garlicky...yum! Unfortunately, the cod was quite overcooked and dry, which is why I didn't give 4 stars. Even the sauce it was served with couldn't save it.  I dont get to Ballantyne that often, but I'll keep Blue Taj in mind when I do. I'd like to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Of all of the places I've eaten, Blue Taj certainly is my favorite. The waiters are very friendly and the food is exceptional (I could eat their naan (which is made fresh and served warm) by the basketful). I have ordered the chicken tangdi korma every time and have yet to regret it. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"We don't have great Indian food options in Columbia, SC, so when we had need to go to Charlotte we asked around and found Blue Taj. It's a great place: cool looking, in a neat indoor/outdoor mall, the service was great, and the food was exceptional.   We had two apps, red wine, two entrees and naan. All were fantastic. Bill was c. $50.   We will go back anytime we have a reason to be in Charlotte.  It'd be great if you could open a location in Columbia."}
{"text":"Best Indian I've found thus far in CLT."}
{"text":"What a great place!  The ambiance of this place is just outstanding.  Colorful lighting illuminates all over the place from the red accent lighting in the bathroom to the color changing ceiling on the patio.  The background music fits perfect, an Indian inspired electro mix.    Many people in the area may not be too familiar with a lot of the entree selections.  Our waiter was very helpful in making recommendations.  Most of the entrees are about $14-18.  The vegetarian is a little less and there are some specialty entrees that are about $25.  I do not quite remember what I ordered but our waiter asked if I liked a couple things and adjusted my meal.  All I know is I had some goat in a red sauce with peppers and onions.  This was the first time I had goat.  It was similar to the lamb but a little more tender, probably because of the bones.  If you are very familiar with Indian food you can order anything you want.  The garlic naan is outstanding!  It is a must get.    There are a couple Indian beers on the menu and specialty cocktails.  I tried one of each.  The Haywards 5000 beer was good, a little more full bodied than a traditional world lager.  The recommended cocktail (I believe he called it a Dizzy Mumbai or something) had whiskey, absinthe, ginger, cumin seeds, and maybe a couple other ingredients.  It definitely paired well with my entree.    I do not see myself dining here often but I am looking very much forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"It's pricy, but really really good!! They do a great take out packaging and I'm so glad they're in ballantyne....they're very accommodating when it comes to spice levels. By far one of the best tikka masalas I've had. My personal favorite is the saag paneer - spicy and well puréed spinach with nice sized paneer pieces. Rice is awesome and always cooked perfectly. (That's important)"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and was treated to the best buffet in the area. So great to be able to try out different dishes. Tons of main dishes but the chicken tikka and the paneer dael  were outstanding. Under cover seats from the sun,  so we sat at an outside table which gave it a fun holiday atmosphere. The interior is beautiful and would be date worthy!   Average prices-business casual dress-relaxed on Sunday for buffet-great parking."}
{"text":"We tried the Blue Taj as takeout one night at a friend's house. I trusted their opinion because they're from the United Kingdom, where some of, if not the best Indian food outside of India can be found. I ordered the Korma (which I always order) and garlic naan. We probably ate our food an hour and a half or so after it had been cooked, Even still, it was delicious! This was the best Indian food I've had outside of England. My husband also feels the same way (he's from England). We've gone back many times since then (including for my birthday supper). I love the restaurant itself. Its got a great atmosphere and I thought the service was great! Love this place."}
{"text":"We are originally from New Jersy where there is a ton of great Indian food and I have lived in India, so I know a good Indian restaurant when I eat at one.  We have eaten at all the Indian restaurants, including the Blue Taj's sister restaurant Copper and Blue Taj has the best Indian food in Charlotte.  Almost, but not as good as NJ but excellent chicken Machkni, raita, samosas and Rosen josh.  I would give it five stars if they made fresh pan daily, but otherwise a very good place for Indian food!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome AWESOME.  I've never had Indian food before and I have to admit - I was a bit *gulp* scared.  All I could think of was me having an Along Came Polly moment later on in the evening.  BUT.  I am a believer of you must trying something (especially food) at least ONCE if you've never had it before.  So...I tried it.  And I liked it.  Our waiter had me and my friends giggling all night long.  He recommended my appetizer and my and a friends' dishes and he nailed it.  I think he could tell that I was the \"virgin\" when it came to Indian food.  I looked up at him with a \"please help\" look.  My food was awesome.  I had a seafood curry dish that was awesome.  I could have jumped in the bowl and ate my way out.  So good.  Patio area was nice and soothing.  A tad too dark when dining at night.  The waiters and the staff were all pleasant and so welcoming.  I will def be back ma'ams.  (inside joke)"}
{"text":"The BEST Indian - period!!!! The restaurant itself is very cool and eclectic - seems like something out of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot to have some really delicious, spicy food.  I came here awhile ago and hope to get back one day soon!!  The restaurant is very nice inside.  The decor is mostly upscale.  The service was wonderful!  I came with a huge group and the waiter was extremely attentive.    The food is a little more pricey than just your average place, but it is definitely worth saving and going for a special occasion.  I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"The Blue Taj is by far the best Indian cuisine in Charlotte.  Full of flavor and color the dishes are sure to satisfy.  From the chicken tikka masala to the curry lamb or seafood dishes like the scallops, or even vegetarian, it is all delicious.  The atmosphere is also very pleasant with good service."}
{"text":"Self-styled as the \"best Indian restaurant in Charlotte,\" The Blue Taj invites high expectations. We arrived around 130p for the Sunday buffet, and the place was hopping.   The good:  lots of veggie options (including several I hadn't tried before, and the most amazing cauliflower), spot-on flavors, quick replacement of empty buffet dishes, and very tasty naan.  The could-be-better:  expensive for a Sunday lunch, an awkward set-up, making it difficult to carry a plate and bowl at the same time while navigating back to ones table, no saag paneer on the day we visited, and tip added to parties of 5 or more.  For delicious, authentic Indian food, the Blue Taj nails it. For pricing, service, and logistics, there's a little more work to be done."}
{"text":"Brought some friends here who had limited experience w. Indian food. They just loved it and I have to concur - blue taj has solid Indian food, and I've eaten at most of the Indian places in Charlotte. For appetizers we had samosas, mango chaat, and chole chaat. The mango chaat was excellent - everyone kept reaching for that dish. Samosa was tasty and the chole chaat was beautifully presented (and also tasty!). We had chicken tikka masala (can't go wrong w this one, spice level of \"2\"), shahi paneer, and lamb rogan ghosh. The lamb blew us all away - it was so tender and flavorful. My only quibble is portion sizes are on the small size for price. Service was excellent and attentive, and I can tell you this is typically a weak point for Indian restaurants, but blue taj clearly trains staff well. Atmosphere is quite nice as well. If you're looking for an Indian restaurant to take guests, you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I am giving 1 star only because of the delicious food i was served. I would have give 5 star thanks to the poor customer service.  Vicky, was the name of the waiter who served me the delicious food, he was an arrogant waiter I have ever seen in my entire life. Right from the moment we stepped into this restaurant his behavior was rude and unacceptable. Being an Indian he took us for granted and was not bringing our beverage for at least more than 10 minutes. This behavior is totally not accepted considering the reputation of the restaurant. I wish my review reaches the higher management of this place and takes necessary action towards the waiter."}
{"text":"Pure class of all Indian delicacies. Ambient, Serene and to  top it off good service.  Any dish here will score the points for your taste buds.  Verdict: Must visit. Best Indian food"}
{"text":"Blue Taj is good for what it is.  With that said, this is definitely NOT an authentic Indian joint.  But I don't care.  It tastes good.  Having traveled to India and lived in Pakistan, I don't go to B.T. when I need my indian fix..... nope, that's when I cook.  But if I want a tasty meal - sure... why not?  The meat is always tender, the food is consistent and the portions are great for the price.  Service can be lacking at times but I usually get it to-go.  Overall, this place doesn't fullfill my cravings for Indian food but I definetely recommend The Blue Taj as a restaurant because hey - if it tastes good it tastes good!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I love the salmon and lamb dishes. Their buffet on the weekends has a great variety and excellent flavor. The wait staff are enthusiastic and give great advice for helping choice a meal. They also know their food inside and out. I always come here with my Indian friends and try what they suggest. We all love it. You cannot go wrong with the Blue Taj!"}
{"text":"Pretty good although consistency in service is an issue. Ive had horrible to great service, but I only go back to get my spice on!!!"}
{"text":"The Sunday buffet is good, but inconsistent. Perhaps they have different chefs, not sure. But for the price it's not bad"}
{"text":"Since Christmas is the busy season for a concert musician, we decided that the cooking of a huge Christmas dinner after a morning of work was just not on the table this year.  Luckily, Blue Taj was open on Christmas day, offering a full menu of Indian goodness.  We started our meal off with a mixed grill appetizer which included lamb, shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken two ways.  It was very tasty, though a little scant for the price.  However, dinner itself was superb.  Our waiter asked us our preference on level of heat--mild, medium, hot, or India hot.  We weren't up to India hot, but my saag paneer was nicely medium spiced and creamy.  My husband went a level hotter with the lamb kadai, which had lots of fresh vegetables and as the name would suggest, succulent lamb.  The garlic naan was buttery and toothsome, and we got a big bowl of rice for the table.  Gulab jamun for dessert--there were only two, but they were really good.  There was a bit of a wait for the food between each course, but it was Christmas day, and the tables were all filled, so that was likely the reason.  We plan to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious scrumptious Indian Food, the dishes are prepared with so much flavor, the mint chutney is thick and delectable (unlike many watered-down versions I've had in other Indian restaurants.)  The staff is friendly, service is quick and courteous but the food is the major winner!  Congrats on being successful, particularly because the location is slightly hidden from public view."}
{"text":"My wife had previously eaten here with someone who lived in India and let her know what to order so she wanted to take me. I would have been lost otherwise.  The ambiance was great inside and I liked the secluded seating throughout the restaurant. This is a great date place. Heads up, you get to choose the spiciness of your food. I I loved the spice level at three which wasn't too hot. In fact, next time I might go with a 4 for a little more kick. Everything was great, but I have to say the Chicken Tikki Masala was my favorite. We had the Chili Chicken for the appetizer and it was solid as well. I would definitely recommend this for an authentic Indian experience."}
{"text":"Went for a date night last night. Loud, over served regulars tried to get in a fight with a polite gentleman who asked them to try and limit their swearing. Then manager bought the regulars a round of shots. When this was mentioned to the staff. The response was \" they're regulars, the other guy isn't\" which was a very odd response in my opinion. Not going back."}
{"text":"This place is always money...if you are in the area and don't stop you are missing out. If you've never eaten Indian food and wanted to try this would be your entry point. Just be fore warned that you will measure every other place against them which you'll be back."}
{"text":"As an Indian, I normally can't justify going to a pricey Indian restaurant & paying for food that either I can cook at home myself or that my mom or an aunt can cook for me. But, in the last few months, I've found myself at Blue Taj twice (once with co-workers for lunch, and once for an anniversary celebratory dinner) Both times, I was impressed by the food, the ambiance and the service. I still believe it's expensive, and may be not entirely worth the money you pay , but it's not complaint worthy. It's worth visiting at least once, specially since I haven't found or heard of any other good Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Ahhh indian food how i love you so. Blue taj does not disappoint, you know its decent when half the place is packed with indians. That said, they definitely use a bit too much cream in some dishes but everything from the ambience to the service to the actual food is spot on and definitely impressive for a city like charlotte. i also like the little outdoor mall its in, you can have indian, grab an espresso and even some dessert all in the same area, so thats key. definitely the only place i would go in CLT for indjun."}
{"text":"Good buffet. Paneer chilly was too good. Less number of dessert options for the buffet. No non veg biryani."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a group of old and new friends. The food itself was delicious, portion sizes were fine, service wonderful and decor beautiful. However the price was ridiculous! To pay $4 for naan with a $15+ entry when it should be included. $5 for a mango lassi is overpriced.. And $15+ for a single entry of vegetable korma is overpriced for the portion size. I can understand $15 for curry goat, being that it's meat and not a common meat compared to cow, pig or chicken. I will not be returning unless it's for buffet or if I have a coupon.   FYI: They also add an 18% gratuity to groups of 5 or more."}
{"text":"Everything was five star from start to finish.   From the Tomato Coconut bisque to the Chicken Tikka Masala to the Mango Mousse dessert. Awesome! Best garlic naan and Chai Tea I have ever had."}
{"text":"Food wasn't all that great. Excellent ambience. But value for money is a little on the lower end."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala!!!! Get it. Just get it!! It is the beat dish I've ever had. I usually like butter chicken but they didn't have it here so I ordered the Chicken Leg Tikhad. It sure does have a kick to it!! I would have enjoyed it just fine if I hadn't tasted my boyfriend's Chicken Tikka Masala. I didn't even want to look at my dish after I took a bite of his. I was in awe when I took my first bite of his dish and was envious throughout dinner lol. He shared his but I knew I had to finish my own. On out second trip, we both got the chicken tikka masala and was very happy. Their naan is the best naan i've ever tasted. So fluffy, moist, and crunchy toasty on the bottom. It was good! We had to order two so we could finish as much of the Chicken Tikka Masala sauce as possible. The staff was very attentive and kind. They'll always get good tips! This is my new favorite Indian place and I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple girlfriends and we had such a great time! The food was definitely on point and the staff was very friendly. Our waiter made a suggestion on a certain lamb we should try and it turned out to be my favorite dish(I don't remember what it was called sorry!) I would definitely go again and highly recommend it the only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is its a little pricy (the rice pudding was $4 and tiny, and no refills on the nan, entrees were a little pricy too). But overall loved it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the lower level at Village of Ballantyne. It was my first Indian food experience And now I'm a huge fan! The server suggested a bottle of Malbec to go with the spiciness and it was SO good. The pita was so fresh and the best I've had so far. Loved the butter chicken. And the kabob appetizer.   The interior is beautiful. Date night material with a darker dining room, linen clothes, etc."}
{"text":"The staff is genuinely helpful and the food is most always on point. There has been some minor inconsistency with dishes, but when they're on, it's the best Indian food I've had to date. I feel their dinner service is better than during lunch and their vegetarian and vegan options are some of the best in the city. Highly recommended for dinner service although it is pretty dark and loud usually."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner last week at Blue Taj. I eat only vegan, whereas my associate does not. However, we both love great Indian cuisine.   We arrived with no reservation on a Thursday evening, around 8:00PM and were greeted quickly and cordially. We were seated within five minutes. The atmosphere was very nice, quiet and our table fairly private. The wait staff were attentive and knowledgeable. I mentioned my vegan requirements and suggestions were quickly made to accommodate me.  The food presentation was great. Plating was clean and simple, food looked great. But the best part of the taste and quality of the food. It was perfect in every way. Spices were exactly as ordered. Mine was modestly spicy. My table mate's was much hotter, as requested.   Vegetables were fresh, tender, cooked perfectly. The sauces were excellent. Our food was hot, but not too hot to enjoy immediately. Everything was delicious!  Prices were very reasonable and fair. Our overall experience could not have been better.  We both agreed that we would return to Blue Taj. And I would recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for excellent, authentically Indian cuisine and courteous service."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had in my life. Not just best Indian food, but food period.   The curry goat is phenomenal as well as the chicken tikka.   You have to get their coconut tomato soup.   I recommend going for lunch though, it's the best deal. You get soup, an entree and desert for $12 and it's almost as much as the dinner portion.   I highly recommend that you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here on  Saturday night and it was packed!!  I felt the quality of the food lacked.  The chicken was more \"tough\" and the naan was burnt.  Also, the service was sporadic...we were either being bombarded or the girl was ghost or the one girl that was very available didn't speak english so she would have to go find someone to interpret what I was asking so that didn't help in terms of service.   The most disappointing aspect of dining here on the weekend is that they don't serve that little appetizer that most indian restaurants serve for free before the meal.  I have NO idea what the technical name is but it is like a thin cracker served with mango and mint chutney for dipping.  I was told that they don't offer that on weekends.  BOOO.  My tip---go to Blue Taj during the week.  I have been a huge fan of theirs but I was pretty disappointed by my first weekend visit."}
{"text":"We visited the Blue Taj Saturday night at 7:30, and it was very busy. We are from out of town and wanted to enjoy The Blue Taj again. This would be our third visit to this restaurant. We were delighted with appetizers of vegetable Somosa and cauliflower Marsala. Both had great flavors with a hint of heat. We then enjoyed the Kerala seafood and Rogan Josh as entrees. The Kerala seafood was just fantastic with it's slight sweet sauce. Then the Rogan Josh had tender lamb chunks in a rich and spicy sauce. Overall we loved our dinner, enjoyed the decor, the atmosphere, and menu choices. There is something for everyone, and the staff can make great suggestions for those who are new to Indian cuisine. Would recommend anyone to visit and look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Enjoyed the Chicken tikka masala (3 heat was just right if you enjoy spicy but not extra hot) served with rice; and an order of garlic Naan. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place seriously if they keep up the quality and customer service is one of the best indian restaurant I have ever eaten a couple of the refreshing changes to old indian classics are amazing Kudos to these guys"}
{"text":"Had Been there for weekend buffet , it was ok. Options were not great and saag was burnt ; when complained the server said that's the taste of veggies they added which was more confusing."}
{"text":"I was overall really impressed with the Blue Taj.  My boyfriend took me here on a date a while back and it was absolutely fantastic.  The atmosphere was very upscale but still cozy, the food was delicious, but what really made it for us was the service.  We made a reservation which I would recommend, and the service was amazing from the moment we walked in until we left.   I wish we could remember our server's name but it was forever ago.  He was so helpful (which is why I would definitely recommend this place to anyone unfamiliar with Indian cuisine but curious) and even suggested a dish that wasn't listed on the menu.  It was quite possibly the most delicious entree I've ever had.  Ever.  The Blue Taj is definitely an excellent date spot, however they did have accommodations for large parties.  I would recommend this restaurant for just about any occasion that calls for awesome cuisine and super friendly service."}
{"text":"Best Indian curries I have had outside of India. In fact, their chicken tikka and chicken tandi korma are absolutely delicious, make sure to get a 3 level spice if you can handle spice.   The best curry I had was in Mumbai based on a local friend's recommendation. That set a tremendous standard. I will say this, Blue Taj's curries have come very close to what I had in Mumbai. The curry was well-balanced, well-spiced, and appropriately flavorful. I know it has the same owners as Blue Taj, but it must be the chef or something because It's leagues beyond Copper in terms of authentic food quality and taste.  Truly the best Indian restaurant I've been to outside of India!"}
{"text":"Sunday Buffet review only.  We decided to come here earlier today because there isn't that great of an Indian food selection near Carolina Place, we have heard Blue Taj is good (but pricey) and they offered a Sunday lunch buffet from 11:30a to 2:30p. The two of us walked in and were able to sit down right away, I would call in earlier for a wait time if you have a larger party. Lunch buffet is a little over $13 per person, our bill was $33 with tip. The ambiance is a little dark, they have a red curtain that is pulled out near the door to block the natural sun light.   I really enjoyed Blue Taj's buffet because of the quality of food followed by the selection.  Our favorite dish was the Chicken Tikka Masala, just as our fellow Yelpers have found. I must admit the Chicken Tikka had a great earthy flavor just as it should have but lacked heat. Very tasty dish and safe for those who don't like hot food. Actually, none of the buffet offerings were hot, just flavored with traditional Indian spices like cumin and coriander. I also enjoyed the chili lamb, it was especially succulent. The Shahi Paneer and fried Bhindi were also delicious. This was also the first buffet I have seen that included Gobi Manchurian, it wasn't as crispy as it would be right out of the fryer, made to order but, it was still somewhat crunchy, kudos. Dessert included a cream/fruit dish and Gulab Jaman, I didn't try the Gulab Jaman I wasn't looking for anything heavy after that meal. The fruit and cream salad was actually really refreshing and crisp with apples, bananas, grapes, melons, strawberries, and watermelon. It was the perfect end to a heavy meal.   I was not a fan of the Pav Bhaji, it looked right but didn't have flavor. I also didn't like the pakoras (possible attempt at Vadas), they were way too doughy. I did not attempt to take on the Pani Puri station, I was pretty much stuffed and looking for tea at that point.   The staff was very attentive, they quickly picked up empty plates and refilled water as expected. Definitely a very good experience. I won't come back for dinner service but count on me for weekday lunch and Sunday buffet. YUM."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! My wife and I have been here probably 25 times and each time everything has been fantastic. The service is awesome the food is unbelievable and I enjoyed the experience each time. The ambience is very nice, they have just added some heated outdoor seating, and there is soothing music playing throughout.  I have had Indian cuisine in several cities and countries around the world, and have never been as happy with my meal as I am at The Blue Taj. I would highly recommend the chicken tiki masala or the lamb vindaloo. Make sure you make a reservation ahead of time, as this restaurant tends to fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Holy smokes...in all my years I have never had a restaurant fall so far so fast...I have eaten here for lunch a few times and had 4 to 5 star experiences...yes the dinner experience was that bad.   We came in tonight celebrating a family event, I made reservations for 4 people for 5:15 (cold and rainy day in Charlotte).  Before I start the review....for the love of all that is Holy..PUT SOME SLIDERS underneath your chairs...everytime someone moved their chair it sounded like nails across a chalkboard.  Service: At 5:05 we walked in..bar was open, one other table was seated, but hostess said they needed 10 minutes to get ready before we could sit as restaurant was not open.  My wife noted hey, it's freezing out there and instead of suggesting even waters at our table the hostess shrugged...we went to a different restaurant for a cocktail.  When we came back 15 minutes later, 4 tables were already seated.   We ordered a cocktail, and of course it was 15 minutes before we got it.  We were then given 3 menus, when we had 4 people .  We asked for a fourth menu and were asked why...your kids can share.  Really?  Even my kids were mad, their waters were never refilled, the waitress seriously grabbed the appetizer plates from underneath them mid bite.       Food: We had the Veg and non-Veg app, non veg was nice but overpriced....all the Veg was deep fried with little differentiation in flavor....  My wife ordered currry, and it looked like an oil slick...my lamb ven de alho was very good, except the rice they brought stuck together and looked like it was day old leftovers.  Both dishes were $17...again overpriced...and na'an was $6 even with 2 entrees.    I hardly ever give 5 stars, nor do I ever give 1 star...but what an incredible discrepancy.  Maybe I will try it again for lunch....but I will never come back for dinner.  My wife thought I was crazy for even recommending, and she is very easy to please.  I cannot remember a time when I just wanted dinner to be done with so I could get the heck out of a restaurant....  Net...food quality suffered tremendously, service was rushed and awful, food came out slow, ambience was incredibly bad....and $108 I will never get back.  Did I mention...PLEASE PUT SLIDERS ON THE CHAIRS...three Advils later and I'm still haunted by the noise!"}
{"text":"Maybe we were there on a bad night?  Our first time there, and it was so highly recommended.  It was crazy busy, no problem.  We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks while waiting for our table.  When our table was ready we closed our bar tab and went to the table.  It was insanely warm...like sweat dripping down our backs warm.  Our waiter was very nice and made recommendations. The waiter kept stopping by our table and apologizing and saying \"only 5 more minutes...\".  It took well over an hour to get our food.   Finally it arrived and while it was not bad, it certainly was not great.  Definitely not better than the much cheaper take out we usually order.  Then came the bill.  My husband noticed the drinks we had at the bar were on our table bill, even though we paid the tab at the bar.  My husband explained this to the waiter.  He then comes back with the manager who demands to see the receipt.  My husband pulls out the receipt to show him...it was very embarrassing.  Finally he agrees to take it off the bill.    Then, my husband hands the waiter his credit card to pay.  The guy comes back and hands it to my husband.  There is no place to sign.  When asked, he said it was because it was a \"reprint\" due to the drinks mistake.  My husband asked \"ok, but it's paid right?\" He says yes.  We leave.  We get halfway to our car and get chased by the waiter who says we have not paid our bill!  Granted...there is some language barrier here...but was hugely embarrassing.  The waiter was very polite and apologized over and over but the whole experience was pretty awful.    Between the heat, the mediocre food, and being embarrassed not once, but twice...I doubt we go back.  Two stars because the waiter was friendly and the appetizer was good."}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with the area or Ballantyne Village, it could be a bit hard to find. But if you park anywhere near Terrace Cafe, then follow the walkway to the right of it, it's right behind Terrace Cafe and the Escalators. You can also park in the Parking Deck and walk right up to it.   I came right after the lunch rush on a Tuesday so there wasn't a wait to be seated. The hostess greeted and seated me right away! I was also poured a glass of water immediately. I didn't need to scan the menu much because I already knew what I wanted but it's a pretty simple lunch menu with very reasonable prices. I ordered the Daily Express Lunch of House Spiced Curry with Chicken. He then asked me how spicy I wanted it which I thought was GREAT that I could use my own heat index. I said I wanted about medium heat spices and he understood. The Daily Express Lunch specials come with Naan and Rice with Soup or Salad. I opted for the soup of the day which was Tomato with Coconut Curry.  First up was my soup which came out quickly. First sip, melted my heart!!! It was absolutely delicious! Very smooth texture bursting with flavor and you can tasted all the herbs and spices in it. To be honest, I wanted more! My waiter came by and asked how I liked it, and I could barely look away from it to answer! Just as soon as I finished my soup, my lunch entree came out. A nice Bowl of the curry with just enough chicken, 4 pieces of Naan, and a large portion of Jeera Rice. I was pleasantly surprised!!! The Naan was soft and warm! I found myself dipping that in my curry as I ate. I'd never had Jeera Rice before but I loved it. It had a nice, light aromatic flavor cooked just right. Where it wasn't overly cooked and wasn't under. The curry was delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it but I just went with it and i'm glad I did! You could definitely taste all of the herbs and spices in it and they got my medium heat just right! I was so happy... then sad... because I got full only a few bites in lol.   Before I could ask, my waiter, whom had been very attentive and friendly the entire time, came and asked if I wanted a box, which I did of course! When he brought my box he explained how to box it. Was it necessary, no... but did I appreciate the extra concern to make sure I properly boxed my food to be able to enjoy it to it's fullest potential later.. DEFINITELY! He told me to pour my curry in the large section, the rice in both of the smaller section, and then take the bread with the paper holding it and place it on top. Great! No soggy bread here! He brought my check, I paid cash and I exited. Great meal at now my favorite Indian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Get the cauliflower appetizer.  It looks like cauliflower in tomato sauce, but the taste is excellent.  I enjoyed the amritsari chicken tikka.  So good, fresh chicken with veggies and a light sauce.  Would totally eat it over and over!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant for dinner after flying into Charlotte Airport. The decor is lovely and the food is rich and on point. Service was great as well. I recommend the sweet lassi (I'm sure the other flavors are great as well). It was a little pricey for what we got but still a great spot to go to if you are craving (North) Indian food."}
{"text":"This is only the second time I've had Indian food let me start off with that. But, the food taste and quality was AMAZING! I'd only previously eaten at a great little Indian restaurant in NYC and that was phenomenal, but ,my only point of reference.  I'm happy to say that The Blue Taj was equally as impressive. Everything from the service level to the food's taste/quality to the ambience was top-notch. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering our food-related questions and even made a few recommendations - both of which were spot on!  For an appetizer we shared the Chatpate Tikki Chole which are potato patties on a bed of seasoned chick peas with wonderful sauce poured over, with a crunchy flat bread to top it off. The flavors were wonderful and the potato patties were very well cooked, soft and flavorful.  Next up were the entrees. My wife ordered the Saag Paneer, which is one of the many vegetarian dishes they offer. Sautéed spinach and cream sauce cooked until it's almost like a porridge with chunks of homemade paneer (soft white cheese) which is flavored with fenugreek and is savory in every bite. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, mild, and I was in love! The chunks of white meat, cooked to perfection in a bowl with the Masala sauce poured over stewing away with all those amazing middle eastern spices....my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  Both entries come with Basmati rice which is as delicious & flavorful as it is aromatic. Additionally, I recommend to anyone reading this to ask for an order of Garlic Naan. Naan is a flatbread that is fire-roasted and served up warm. The garlic version kicks it up a few notches, especially when you dip it into the variety of sauces served with each entree, it's to die for!  Finally, feeling extremely full but wanting to have a little something sweet, for dessert we ordered Malai Kulfi. Essentially this is Indian ice cream that is homemade with Saffron and Rose Water and is very creamy. I wasn't too impressed at first since it was still a little too cold to eat, but as it slowly set to room temperature, I was able to appreciate this as the perfect compliment to an Indian meal, especially since some dishes can vary in spiciness from none to extremely hot. The cream-base helped to dull to flame from the Tikka Masala and the honey-like flavor was a nice end to an incredible meal."}
