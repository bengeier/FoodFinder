{"text":"So happy that there's a gluten-free bakery in Pittsburgh. My husband and I tried some of their baked goods for the first time this past weekend. I had the chocolate lavender cupcake. It was too much lavender for my taste but the cake was nice and moist. The \"oat\"meal cream pie was huge and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try their fresh bread and waffles!"}
{"text":"After seeing their Sweet Potato and Black Bean Empanada on their scrumptious Instagram account, I had to come in! (Plus, I'm vegan, and the variety of options appealed to my foodie side). Easy to find location, and walking in I thought that it was a good sized space for couples and groups alike. The long wooden table was beautiful! Simple white walls and a whole lotta goodies. Service was okay at the front register; perhaps it was the early hour, but the cashier didn't seem eager to take our order. As if she would rather be doing something else. Anyways, the Empanada was flaky and so tasty, I would come back here just for that. My sister got the Strawberry Rhubarb waffle, which she thought was okay. I tried a little bit and thought that the strawberry rhubarb compote was the star of the plate. Not worth $11 in my opinion. Next time I'll be back to try their vegan cheesecake because they're the only place I know that sells it fresh. 4 star rating for the memorable empanada, variety of vegan options, and nice simplicity of the store, but took off a star because of the service and okay waffle."}
{"text":"The apple cider donut was amazing! Didn't even notice the difference!!"}
{"text":"My ideal morning includes a cup of coffee paired with an excellent baked good, which is why I have been so delighted in recent recent months. I keep running into treats from Gluten Free Goat Bakery in coffee shops throughout the East End. Then today at the Pittsburgh Public Market I bought a whole sampling to share with my family visiting from out of town. I was reminded that above all else, it's their raison cookie! Yes, I know their donuts are capturing most people's attention, but for me it's all about their fabulous raison cookie which I love because it is perfectly moist, with little crystalline sugar accents and sweetened just right. As an aside, I wanted to shout out to whoever is behind their simple, clever brand. Yes, the logo is cute, but I get a serious kick out of saying Gluten Free Goat out loud."}
{"text":"Even if you aren't gf or vegan it is worth stopping in for a sweet treat. The lemon raspberry donut only made it as far as the car! Lol."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I walked a good bit to visit the bakery from finding it online. Once I got there, I couldn't even tell if they were open because there was barely anything out to look at to purchase. She listed off 3 items to choose from. I also didn't taste much of a difference from the apple cider and pumpkin donuts. They were good but wouldn't go back until they were set up somewhere I happen to be."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gluten free bakery! The desserts are amazing and their food is delicious! It's a great atmosphere. Very clean and cute inside. Great place for breakfasts, lunch or just a treat and some tea/coffee."}
{"text":"First time here - love this place! Bright space, Great food and super-nice people. If you're looking for a pleasant place for a healthy break and with good energy - stop in! My first time, but not my last for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely patient and helpful (...my mother and I had several questions), and the food was fabulous! Very fresh, great textures, and considering the specialty ingredients and housemate quality, surprisingly reasonably priced. 

Also loved the bright space and ocean of beautiful dessert options."}
{"text":"Yay!  Despite the name, everything here is vegan.  The proprietor was very friendly and excited about her products, and I picked up a donut, but decided against a pie and other items.  

It's located in the Pittsburgh public market, which has a ton of hip food places (the nearby pasta shop has lots of vegan options).  

Unfortunately, I can only give this place 4 stars - there weren't a ton of items out (I think it might have been early in the day, so this might be unfair), and the donut was good, but not amazing.  Still, it's exciting to see so many vegan options in Pittsburgh (as a visitor from Oakland, CA), and I'd definitely come again on my next visit."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with Gluten Free Goat! The food here is excellent and caters to an ever-growing population of those with food sensitivities. They have a variety of sandwiches, salads, and soups as well as an extensive display of sweets to select from. We stopped here for lunch and were not disappointed. The Vegan Sammy on their rosemary GF focaccia bread was out of this world. The flavors all worked together so well and made for a great, palate pleasing sandwich. It comes with the option of a side salad or soup as well, with the soup varying on the week. We did not have the pleasure of trying any of their sweets at that time, but will certainly be back for more!

The space is open and inviting, and it is set up as a bistro. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you when it is ready. The seating can be challenging as it is limited. If there are others there working or eating, finding a table can be difficult. There is bar seating along the wall, however it is quite narrow and makes it difficult to sit there comfortably and eat. Despite this, I highly recommend for those looking for GF options, or anyone looking to try something new!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending an event at this bakery and becoming introduced to how delicious gluten free food can be. My favorite treat was the biscuits and gravy, a special that is made on the weekends for brunch. The taste was excellent and hard to believe it was made with gluten free and vegan friendly ingredients. I also loved the donuts which are sold at coffee shops throughout Pittsburgh. In addition to all the awesome food, the real gem of the place is the owner. Warm, welcoming, and inspiring she started cooking this way after she was diagnosed with celiac disease. This place is a real gem and I can't wait to try this place out again!"}
{"text":"I have visited Gluten free goat bakery multiple times, both weekdays and weekend.  My favorite by far is their waffle with chocolate chips.  Great texture to the waffle and huge portion size.  The staff is always super nice, friendly and willing to explain their products.  I have had the apple cider donut and though it is a different texture than you would expect from a more traditional donut... the flavor is good.  Nice gluten free strip district choice"}
{"text":"Incredible! They just opened up their brick & mortar  - such nice people! Got their grilled cheese of the day - they know how to pick their flavors! Rosemary bread was full of flavor and a great consistency. The cheese selection balanced the bread perfectly & had an added crunch with apple slices. 

Donuts are perfection. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've only had the ice cream sandwich but it was so delicious! Everything is gluten free and vegan. Amazing place. Only reason I gave them one less star than perfect is because their ice cream sandwich was less than advertised. In the display case they showed massive amounts of ice cream and what I got was a smaaaall amount. Pictures shown. I'm definitely going back though. I just wish I got the ice cream that was shown."}
{"text":"This place is great for certain gluten free baked goods, but their bread/sandwiches/salad were not great. Fortunately, I'm not/do not require on a gluten free diet, so the fact that the items are gluten free isn't a particular draw for me. I've tried the donuts and cinnamon rolls and think both are delicious, but their focaccia for their sandwich was so dense and wet that it tasted almost like eating a sandwich on a dessert bread rather than a more traditional sandwich bread. It definitely was not for me. Also, the salad that came on the side had a green vinaigrette dressing that had almost no taste. I'm leaving 4 stars instead of 3 because I think their baked goods are worth a try, especially if you are following a gluten free diet. I wouldn't recommend their other fare, though."}
{"text":"**Same review from the Yelp Swing Into Summer Party.

Super Awesome American fun. Thank you, Rachel, for a great Yelp party.

I would like to have a special shout out to Gluten Free Goat. As we were checking out all of the stands, we stopped at GFG because my friend's husband and 5 year old son have celiac. We tried some items (the snickerdooldles tasted amazing). As we chatted with Jeanette and my friend talked about how sometimes gluten free baked goods are hard to find and some just don't taste right, Jeanette said \"Let me just give you some cookies for your son and husband\" and like that bam! my friend had some to go treats. Thank you for going above and beyond with your great product."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful bakery! The gluten free items we purchased included donuts, cookies, cup cakes, and a flourless torte. It's located in a cool part of Shadyside. It's a must visit!"}
{"text":"Both this business and the amazing owner easily earn a 5-star rating in my book! I've tried several of the donuts as well as the almond butter brownie and the waffle (topped with apples, real maple syrup, and almond butter) and each one is incredible for being gluten-free, not to mention they happen to all be vegan as well. An added bonus (to me at least) is that everything from this bakery is made with quality ingredients rather than unhealthy substitutes, and I think that's what makes the taste so great. The owner is extremely personable and really cares about her products, and it shows. I'm so happy there's a permanent storefront now, because it means I'll be eating even more of those waffles."}
{"text":"As someone with Celiac Disease, finding gluten free sweets that actually taste good can be difficult sometimes! I'm so happy that I found this place and their Pumpkin Spice donuts!! I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that I live a block from them now!! I want to go back every day!"}
{"text":"I always loved these donuts, I purchase them almost every time I go to zeke's and have had them at various yelp events. I wanted to bring in unique donuts for my birthday at work and thought this place would be the perfect spot to go to. I have never been in the bakery itself so I was really excited to finally check it out. I came in on a Friday to order them to pick up on Sunday. I ordered 10 assorted donuts. I live on the completely opposite side of town and therefore had to make a special trip to get here on Sunday to pick them up for my birthday the next day. I arrived around 3:20 pm and was told my order had been sold. They tried to call me and did leave a message, however I had been busy all day and didn't check my phone. I couldn't believe they would sell my order. Isn't that why you make an order? To reserve the product? I was clearly upset when I was informed my order was sold, but the gentleman behind the counter didn't do anything to make my experience pleasant or to try to earn my business. I was really hoping to have some delicious apple cider  donuts and wow my coworkers with their unique flavors but instead I'll have to grab something else. If they are going to be that picky on when a person arrives to pick up an order they placed, they really should consider making the customer pay for their order ahead of time, or even just charging for 50% of the order right away. That's what they do in many bakery's, and I would have had no problem in doing so when I placed my order in person on Friday, had I been asked to do so. I also would have appreciated a little more understanding or a simple apology when I came to pick up my order and realized it had been sold. Really disappointed and do not think I will bother returning. Any place that can't honor an order isn't worth my time."}
{"text":"Wonderful place and wonderful owner. She is such a sweetheart! Jeanette is the best!! Must go! Located in the Pittsburgh Public Market"}
{"text":"Great experience here!! Everything is 100% gluten free great for a celiac like me! Delicious food and vast selection of coffee and teas available. Definitely something here for everyone. Gluten free or not. Peaceful atmosphere and very sweet staff. Felt right at home here."}
{"text":"Great simple cafe eats! I visited twice already and was very impressed with the deliciousness of gluten free and vegan dishes. First, I had the vegan benedict with the soup. It was very good but the portion was small... which left room for donuts. Upon returning, I got the waffle with banana and almond butter.... so massive and filling no room for donuts hahaha. I will probably add this to the list of places that I frequent in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"My partner has celiac's, and I'm vegetarian, so I am always on the lookout for a place that can accommodate the double whammy of dietary restrictions. Gluten Free Goat to the rescue!

We came in for brunch on a Saturday. It was reasonably busy, but we had no trouble finding a table. We ordered the vegan biscuits and gravy and the vegan benedict to share with each other.

The vegan biscuits and gravy were the much more successful dish - the gravy is nice and the biscuits have a good texture. The benedict on the other hand worked less well because the chickpea egg was quite dry and there was not much sauce to compensate. There was nothing to evoke the runny yoke of a normal benedict.

For dessert we had a blueberry poptart and a cinnamon bun. The poptart was perfect, but the cinnamon bun was a bit dry. I think more cinnamon syrup and/or icing can ameliorate that.

I'm so, so grateful this restaurant exists!"}
{"text":"This place offers many vegan/gluten free options which is a refreshing change. The place has a great interior and the staff was friendly. There were mostly ups with the food however a few missed the mark for me. The mac and cheese was delicious, the cupcakes were good as well as their donuts. The falafel waffle didn't quite hit the mark for me and the apple turnovers also weren't up to par. Overall a good meal though!"}
{"text":"I am an avid fan of the Gluten Free Goat. I love coming here for a late breakfast or brunch in the weekends. It is the only place where I can eat waffles, lattes, and donuts in a single meal without ending up feeling terrible about myself and super full. They're all gluten-free (obviously) and vegan - so it's a great place to get your morning almond milk latte.
They use thoughtful, high-quality ingredients, so it's one of those places where you won't feel like you're \"missing out\" on the real deal or where they're restricting what you eat."}
{"text":"This is a seriously cool place to eat! I am not gluten intolerant or anything but I love to eat gluten free or vegan (or both) if I get the chance! I have tried several things from here now and I would like to make this a cafe I frequent. The owner/cook here has celiac and has spent 10+ years perfecting her recipes and trying new things. For the average non-vegan/gluten free diner, I would say it could be a hit or miss with her hot prepared foods but a homerun for any and all desserts. As for the vegan/gluten free people.. this place is heaven. 

Only drawbacks are that it is pretty pricey and her hours aren't always the most convenient. They are only open until 2 unless it is the weekend. She is trying to make dinner happen, and I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed tonight's Yelp event as an individual with no food allergies or restrictions. I was pleasantly surprised during evening as Jeanette presented some traditional dishes which were gluten free and vegan! 

We began with macaroni and cheese which was the least interesting to me. The combination of gluten free noodles with a cashew cheese was the greatest departure from what I know as traditional Mac-n-cheese. The sausage gravy and biscuits was delicious! I was surprised by the lentil \"sausage\" which was very reminiscent of a traditional breakfast sausage. KUDOS!

The desserts included an apple cider-cinnamon donut, raspberry turnover and \"oatmeal\" cream pie, which had no oatmeal! All of the desserts were phenomenal and I would highly recommend them to my gluten-free friends AND people with no restrictions. 

Jeanette was very informative to help us understand the difference between celiacs and gluten-free. This establishment is a great option for those seeking:
Gluten-free
Corn free
Soy free 
Oat free
Peanut free ... and ...
Vegan options!!! 

My gluten-free friend really enjoyed the evening and is looking forward to returning for your products in the future."}
{"text":"A spiritual vegan experience.  This place provides a safe vegan experience.  I trust the ingredients that they use, and find their dishes delicious.  The establishment is somewhat small but provides a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast there this morning. We had Belgian Waffle with seasonal fruit and maple syrup. It was delicious as was our Americana coffee and Latte. Service is excellent. Desserts are amazing! Definitely we'll be stopping in again in the near future."}
{"text":"Went to GFG today for coffee and an Apple Cider doughnut. The shop is adorable and the coffee & doughnut were perfect. Great place to hang out for a couple hours on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"Thrilled to see more gluten-free options popping up around Pittsburgh. I had previously enjoyed Gluten Free Goat's donuts from Amazing Cafe and couldn't wait for their brick & mortar to open. We arrived a bit late on a Sunday, so I knew they would potentially be out of a few things. I was hoping to try the carrot cake, but they were sold out (I'm also not 100% sure if this is an item they typically sell by the slice in-store, or if you have to special order).

We went with a Belgian waffle with almond butter and bananas, which was perfection, and the grilled cheese of the day with salad, as they were out of soup. The grilled cheese was very good, but I'd absolutely suggest the waffle if you stop by on a Saturday or Sunday for brunch. The donuts were excellent, as always, with apple cider being a great choice any time of year.

I know they just opened not long ago, but in the future, I'd love to see more seating as it gets busy on weekends, and possibly some background music playing. Always a big fan of supporting local businesses, so I'd highly recommend giving Gluten Free Goat Bakery a try."}
{"text":"Came here for a yelp event and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know what to expect from the menu I was going to try but I would come here again. I am pescatarian so I like the fact that I can eat anything there. The Apple cider donuts are so good. I didn't particularly like the Mac and cheese though but everything else was really tasty."}
{"text":"Great food. Great space. And not a gluten to be found. Soup of the day is delicate and delicious."}
{"text":"This review is with regard to a cake. I ordered a cake for my sons graduation as he is vegan. The cake was extremely dry and tasteless. I have ordered from other gluten free bakeries before and wanted to try this one. It was quite pricey -$50. It was the lemon flavor. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a coffee and a catch-up. The space here is bright, open and inviting. We sat on the couch that faces the front window. The cappuccino that I had was close to perfect. The folks working there were all positive and great to interact with, which I believe can be a rare find behind an espresso machine! I didn't have anything to eat, but I will be back soon, and I'm not GF!"}
{"text":"I read about this place in the newspaper today and remembered visiting it when it was part of the Pittsburgh Public Market. They now have their very own permanent place. Everything is made on the premises using local, seasonal, and organic ingredients. They are also soy, oat, and corn free. i also learned that they have a brunch menu. WiFi is free and the pass-code is written out for you.

I learned that nothing everything on the menu is vegan but they will point that out to you on the menu. The do have quiche dishes for example The \"cake\" on display is used for special ordering. They have a nice selection of baked goods, desserts and even some lunch options. I decided to try the salad of the day which was overladen with chick peas. The green dressing that came with it was all natural made. Course I could not pass up one of those tempting donuts! I opted for the pineapple ginger donut but believe me the apple cider one looked good as well.

My salad was not too heavy but very nutritious and the green dressing was unique. When I had my donut it was laden with their special sugar but it wasn't too overwhelmed nor overfilling. It was just enough for dessert! Metered street parking is available and it is close to Children's hospital. This is a must return to try out their other offerings. It is centrally located so you can shoot out to some of the other neighborhoods while you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great space on Penn Avenue.  Visually beautiful and tasty gluten-free pastries. Had a great lattes in a mug.  Nice staff.  . Penn Avenue gets better every day."}
{"text":"Not inexpensive, but such a delight for a Celiac with a sweet tooth. 

Apple Cider doughnuts are probably the best item offered. 

Salads, sandwiches, and quiche are great. Waffle wasn't my favorite. 

Nice casual space for meeting friends."}
{"text":"Five stars all around! Look I'm not someone who seeks out gluten-free foods and I typically don't even care. But I'm not against eating gluten-free either. Also I like donuts but not enough to search out. I may eat one or two a year. Everything is changing now because I am addicted to the lavender lemon donut."}
{"text":"I love gluten Free Goat! 

The first time I came here was for some baked goods to bring home. I picked up a scone and a chocolate pistachio cupcake. Both were delicious and my dad LOVED the cupcake. 

The second time was for Saturday brunch. My dad and I both had the vegan Benedict while my mom and brother had the French toast. Both were delicious. The egg in the Benedict could've been a little fluffier but still an interesting texture. The hollandaise sauce was delicious and the bacon tasting mushrooms. 

We also shared a cinnamon roll, it was so tasty! Such a cute place."}
{"text":"It's funny, I had eaten some tasty bites from GFG for a couple years at off-site events they were at, but hadn't had the chance to stop in to the New(ish) brick and mortar. Well, fast forward to my recent celiac diagnosis and this shoots up to the top of my list! 

First off, I want to say the owner is so kind and knowledgeable. She is also a fellow celiac, and takes care to make things the right way. That way is healthy, natural and delicious! 

I've had a handful of items. Basically when I went in I had a hankering for all the things I couldn't eat normally. So I got cupcakes, cookies and brownies. I told you, I needed it all. Legit the sugar cookies taste exactly like regular flour based ones. The brownie chocolatey goodness. I'm picky about brownies and hate when they're cake-like. I want a gooey, fudge like brownie, and this is. The cupcake frosting, which I later found out is coconut based, it delightful. It's light and delicious. The cupcake itself is good, but probably one of the sweets I could tell was different from a white flour base. It wasn't bad, just a different taste and a little denser. 

I've also really enjoyed the savory vegetable tarts. She seriously has a flaky crust down. AND THE DONUTS! Do not come here without getting a donut, specifically the apple cider one. I love cake based donuts (I know, I'm contradicting myself because I don't like cake style brownies), and these are probably some of the best donuts I've ever had! I cheated and tried the chai donut the other day and it was just as good as the cider ones. 

They're really on point. I'm excited to come back for brunch and I love that she is now hosting themed GF dinners. I almost forgot to mention the chai here is great and they have a full coffee bar, so it's a nice place to stop in and enjoy a drink and sweet (or savory) treat!"}
{"text":"If you're a person on the hustle, brace yourselves. Great food and great atmosphere but unfortunately it takes the staff 20 minutes to make an espresso and 40 minutes to make a waffle. The speed at which the staff works would never fly in most East Coast cities, and probably not even in the South. Pick it up guys, you have a viable business here that you're going to lose the second you have competition!"}
{"text":"Finally got to visit the brick and mortar shop. Had a very solid latte from the coffee bar, and had a tasty vegan waffle with vegan butter and syrup. Awesome texture and taste. Also tried the nut butter and banana waffle. Very nice taste with the nut butter . I liked the aesthetic of the place, maybe needs some artwork or something to make it feel more cozy. Loved the tables and the service was super nice . I will be back for sure ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It is so cute and definitely somewhere I could spend a day, nibbling and drinking iced tea. The food was divine and the service was great.

The ONLY downside is the hours. I can't make it here unless it's the weekend."}
