{"text":"A very nice place for a after work pizza. First time here, after searching yelp review. The pizza there is great, smoothies even better! I wouldn't say the same for their pasta. Even tho the sauce taste fine, it's nothing comparing to a fair pasta experience at any Italian dining. Over all love the place, would come again on the way back from work."}
{"text":"This is a pizza joint. Why are people rating it based on decoration? Go to a $$$$ 5 star michelin restaurants if you want service. Be real.  The pizza - Amazing.  Love:  1. Selection.  2. Pizza size - 1-person pizza.  3. Price - $5-6 + tax.  4. Efficiency - Hot fresh pizza ready to pick up within 5 minutes.  5. Simple - You pick, you pay, you pick it up and eat it. When you are ready, they are ready to serve you.  6. Inspiring stories and quotes on the inside of the pizza box. Gives a personal touch. Very special indeed. Never seen it anywhere else.  Will definitely go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've worked by coco brooks for a few ears now and I don't think I'll ever get bored with it. There is so much I choose from. I love that they have a kids menu, and the portions are huge! I like how they do fundraisers with the frozen pizzas as well. Won't stop going here any time soon!"}
{"text":"I love Coco Brooks. I've been coming here for years and every time I get excited and feel like a kid in a candy store albeit that it's a pizza store.  Perhaps it's the nostalgia of the once a year personal pan pizza day at school years ago or the fact that there are so many selections to choose from with very reasonable prices but this has always remained my favourite pizza place in Calgary.   When I come with my family we each choose a different pizza and share so we get to try lots of varieties. When many chains and mall pizza joints are skimping out on ingredients and toppings Coco Brooks pizza still remains top notch and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have to give Coco Brooks full credit!   After my very honest, but scathing review they reached out to me and were genuinely concerned about the problems I faced.   They did a great job of explaining what happened without trying to justify the situation. They wanted me to know what happened and accepted full responsibility.   I was told to expect a gift card in the mail. Well, it arrived today and I was concerned it would be for a token amount which would have frustrated me more.   While I didn't have an idea of what would be acceptable, I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised with the amount I received.   Well done Coco Brooks, I will be back to try another large order with you! You've earned that.   Thanks."}
{"text":"Back in the early days of my career, one of my workplaces was a few blocks away from here and I don't think my coworkers and I went more than a week without devouring pizza from Coco Brooks.   The best thing about this place is that their pizzas are premade - all the ingredients are listed so what you see if what you get. No moderations, no substitutions. I think this improves their efficiency, but also it guarantees consistency in their pizzas. My fave is their hot wing pizza, juicy chunks of chicken breast smothered in hot sauce, cheese and spices.   Pizza's not your thing? Their pita bread salad bowls are quite delish. And really, how often can you eat the container your food comes in?   One thing you must try here is their banana bread pizza, a thick layer of cream cheese filling is sandwiched between two slices of super moist banana bread."}
{"text":"Coco Brooks were one of the food vendors at the Calgary Comic Expo in 2015.   I ate a pepperoni pizza. It was ok, but not amazing.   What was amazing was what happened the next day. It's called Ecoli food poisoning and it makes you ill. Specifically, you get light headed, a headache and bad stomach pains and cramps. You also throw up everything you have eaten, including water. If you haven't thrown it up, it will burrow it's way out of your body one way or the other. Expect to be sick for about 24-36 hours.   I would not choose to feel like that again, so beware of where your food comes from unless you want to see it twice in one day.   The only good part was losing 4 pounds."}
{"text":"Well this place is a little different, and I love it. This place has amazingly delicious personal sized pizzas. Baked in 12 minutes and served piping hot. There're many choices. Several on my favorite list. This day I enjoyed the Beef, Onion, Pineapple and gawd it was good.    Whenever I'm in Calgary I try to get to this place for a delicious affordable pizza. So good."}
{"text":"Having been someone who worked at a Pizza Joint back in the day, I can surely appreciate a good pizza.  Coco Brooks definitely has good pizza, but I'm gonna be honest, the restaurant (if you can call it that) leaves a lot to be desired. It feels like a cafeteria when you go in there and most people eating there are glued to one of the two TVs coming down from the roof.   There is NO decor and it gives me the 'ghetto vibes'.  On the plus side though, you can call ahead and your pizza will be ready when you get there.  It's damn good pizza, so I suggest you order ahead, get your pizza to go, and skedaddle outta there!"}
{"text":"I came to this location for lunch and ordered 3 pizza's to take home. A Saturday afternoon lunch treat.  Ordering at the counter was quick and easy. I was advised my order would be about 10 minutes to make. No problem since I could reply to some emails and keep busy till it was ready.  Ordered: 1 kids cheese pizza, 1 classic veggie and 1 Big Al's pizza  (a meaty type of pizza). All was ready in that time frame and ready to take home and enjoy.  There's ample seating for those who want to stay and dine in.  This location was clean and had a steady amount of patrons eating in and taking orders to go.   Coco Brooks pizza is great. We all really enjoyed it. It was fresh, hot and one of the best veggie pizza's I have had. Love the pineapple combination with veggies. YUM!!!!!  Their selections are great, their staff is super friendly, and the pizza is affordable. Will be back when I am in that neck of the woods again."}
{"text":"The place is definitely a hole in the wall restaurant with tacky decor and obscure location. My friends and I ordered the calzones and they massive. We all enjoyed our food. You get your bang for the buck here, overall, it's a nice place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"#133  I had seen this location as well as the 42nd Ave location several times but never a gander to be had until today when around 3:30pm MT, I was driven here by fellow elite Al C.  Those whom know me would describe me as anal retentive when it comes to food so it should come as no surprise when I got upset because you cannot change out an ingredient such as sausage on Big Al's pizza pie for bacon as the pies are apparently pre-made.  So, I ended up getting the Egg n Bacon (scrambled eggs, black pepper, mozzarella cheese, smoked bacon, aged cheddar) and a regular fountain drink. It took about 15 minutes (literally). When I got my pie, the paper was baked onto the crust. And as much as I probably need fiber, wax paper fiber was probably not what the doctor ordered (though it should make the food go down easier).  Al C. then proceeded to exchange the pie for me which the nice lady said sorry (so very Canadian), proceeded to replace the pie, and the gentlemen offered a free salad while I waited which I declined but thanked him anyway. About 10 minutes later, I received my replacement pie. It was delicious and wax paper free.  Even though the experience was less than stellar today, it's a mistake and we all make mistakes. The point of this review is that a mistake was made and the staff took care of it without being grumpy or rude (and that is what customer service is about and what is sorely missing in many places in Canada).  I would love to be able to customize a pie even if takes longer to make but that would likely be a company policy update to fix.  Because of the customer service, I will most likely be back soon to this location because I know if something is wrong, they will take care of it.  I would like to rate 3.5 stars but Yelp! has yet to implement a half-star system.  Oh I forgot to mention the free slice of banana bread the gentleman gave with the replacement pie.  Got milk?"}
{"text":"Ok I finally tried coco brooks... everyone kept telling me how good the pizza was and because I work close to there I thought i would try it.  I was there at 1130 and was shocked at how busy it was... there was a line up to the counter  and a massive menu to choose from. Luckily I was with a seasoned regular who talked me through the ordering process because god help you if you dont know what you want when you get to the front..  Something I didnt know was that there are 2 ways to order here...you can order an  express pizza ( premade ready to serve pizzas in a variety of selections) or you can custom order one however in that case you will be waiting about 10 - 15 mins.   The pizza is very very good... a huge assortment of options on a delicious deep but crispy crust.   The sauce is zesty and tasty.   The staff are efficient and friendly. One neat thing are the coco brooks pizza boxes. Each one has a ton of interest bits of writing on it...quotes,stories, and anecdotes....all positive and upbeat.  There are a variety of different boxes.. Ok now onto the decor... Moez is right, it looks like a prison cafeteria...dark horrible colors with plastic garden furniture chairs.  You dont go in here to relax and eat...we did, but I wont again. I will order to go.  So all in all great food, nice service and horrible decor."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas!  And the price is just right.  I would go here again if I was ever in the neighborhood.  They didn't have a driver in to deliver to my hotel tonight, so I made the trip over and glad I did!"}
{"text":"Now featuring Gluten Free HOT for take out or eat in!!  I'm sure I mentioned it for the other location of Coco Brooks  - but all locations have this for your dining pleasure.  I am so very happy to know these folks.  They've contacted me previously about using my comments on their website.  I am a very happy & loyal customer.  I buy my gluten free pizzas in bulk frozen to bring back to Edmonton. I even have a special cooler I give them so I don't have to take a plastic bag, and they make it home still entirely frozen!  So much to say - I understand the regular people pizza is very good, they offer great salads, and I am NOT a smoothie lover, but the Strawberry Banana ... no trip to Calgary is complete without one.  They're ready in the super cold fridge for you - and don't be a dud like me - just poke the straw through the plastic on top. (Yes, in hindsight my struggle to figure it out was really amusing. And my struggle was because you used to get it straight from the machine - it's new to me!)  Regular pizzas are also available as Hot eat-in, Take-out, and Take n Bake. There's even a Take and Bake Membership!!   It's a great deal!  From the website: Order your favorite pizza to take with you and bake from the comfort of your own home!  For only $7.99 you can become a Take n Bake member.  This membership includes:  An oven thermometer to ensure proper baking temperature A real pizza wheel for easy cutting Two pizza screens for proper cooling Pizza lifter Preparation instructions Save up to 17% from the hot menu pricing!  They also support local schools and organizations by hosting fundraisers - if someone asks you if you'd like to purchase pizzas - it's a definite win-win for everyone. Delicious food, money in the charity's pocket, and keeps Coco Brooks supporting their work in the community."}
{"text":"I love coco brooks!! I would give them 5 stars if they didn't push their religion on me with EVERY pizza I buy!!"}
{"text":"This is a locally owned and operated pizza joint. I heard the owner named the pizza place after his kids.  All of the pizzas are personal pan size, so everyone in your family can get their own pizza with their own choice of toppings.   I especially like the Bootlegger Pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green pepper. There's also calzones and salads available.  I also quite like the banana bread pizza complete with a cream cheese topping.  If you want, buy some pizzas to make later in the week. (They come frozen)."}
{"text":"very causal very fast and very good pizzas! you can almost get any kind of pizzas you want the moment you order it.  it's a good casual place to meet a friend or something."}
{"text":"Why haven't I ever Yelped Cocobrooks before?    I love cocobrooks and it's probably been some of my favorite pizza for over a decade.    I buy it from fundraisers for cooking at home and I find excuses to stop in when I'm around one (sadly no actual restaurant by me even though they have a large number of locations now).  This location is my \"coming home from the airport\" tradition if the opening hours work out or something to check out when I'm in PM Hobby next door.  I find the food reasonable and everyone gets what they want.  There is no compromising at cocobrooks and with lots of options the issue is usually \"which one to pick this time?\"   I love the new orleans veggie personally  (the tomato sauce was substituted with hot sauce) and it's a nice fiery treat that leaves my lips tingling for a while after I'm done but it's not really that spicy.  Banana bread pizza for dessert is an absolute must but you should probably plan to share that as it's really made for 4 people or so."}
{"text":"I have had pizza from here a few times. It has always been super yummy! My husband and love it!   Lots of options to choose from.  But I just get a classic veggie one every time.  The pizza is always so hot...so I recommend just taking it home and then eating it.. by that time it's perfect temperature haha."}
{"text":"We loved Coco Brooks!!  Great food at a reasonable price.  I'm glad we found this gem.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant interior is not that classy, but so what.  I care more about value than fancy tile and snobby wait staff.  The service was also very friendly and helpful. They treated us like they actually appreciated our business... That's very rare nowadays.  If you have the chance, try it out!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of working close to Coco Brooks for about a year.  It was a pleasure due to the ease of getting there, but also due to the convenience it afforded my employer to order from them during company functions (lunch meetings and the like).  Their pizza is really, really good.  While certainly not the cheapest pizza you can find, the quality and variety are amazing and the price is very affordable.  I tried a few of their pizzas, ultimately deciding on Ranch Chicken as my favourite.  And every time I had it, it was just as delicious as the last time I enjoyed it.  Now the location itself leaves a lot to be desired.  It feels like a prison cafeteria in that place, so I would recommend against eating in (most people don't).  Actually, I should say it looks like a prison cafeteria, since I have no firsthand experience of what a prison cafeteria feels like (or do I?  The mystery continues.)  If you're in the mood for a personal size pizza, stop in and enjoy, but leave quickly."}
{"text":"My love affair with Coco Brooks Pizza started out 8-9 years ago when I used to work in the SE and it was offered up for lunch.  We hit it off instantly.   Fast forward to the present.  Hubs works in the NE and we are a family of 4 pizza lovers each with individual tastes.  Coco Brooks satisfies our uniqueness with a nice selection to choose from.  It's not uncommon on a Friday evening for us to pick up their take n bake and enjoy Coco Brooks pizza with a movie at home.   Or even grab hot pizza's and head to the park for a pizza picnic.  My husband is a creature of habit and always gets the Mile High.  I like to shake it up a bit and try different ones although admittedly I tend to defer to the Chicken Hot Wing Pizza (spicy goodness).   I am only giving Coco Brooks 4 stars since we typically phone our order in and pick up the take n bake.  On at least 3 occasions this year there have been mistakes on our pizzas which have not been noticed until after taken home and baked.  Also participated in a Coco Brooks fundraiser and did not find the fozen carrot cake pizza very tasty.  We are fans and will continue to frequent Coco Brooks for Friday night movie nights!"}
{"text":"Coco Brooks, both locations in Calgary are a great example of a thriving small business.  Service appears to be at the heart of this organization, you can sense it the minute you walk in the front door, when you pick up the menu, when you are greeted, when you pick up your pizza and you definitely feel it the minute you sink your teeth into your first bite of \"Big Al's\" or \"Buffalo Wing Pizza\" or a Calzone."}
{"text":"Coco Brooks... the way I figure personal-sized pizzas are meant to be. There's no full-size here, but there are a myriad of terrific toppings to be had on. My favourite? The Mile High. It's one club that's easy to be a part of.  As an order out option, Coco Brooks is the talk of many an office. Once upon a time, when I worked in the NE, this was our favourite monthly office treat. We'd place our orders a few days in advance and then 'za it out at lunch time with our personal orders and some treats in the form of rice krispie pizza, banana bread pizza and cinnamon pizza. FYI - the banana bread pie takes the take.  On location, there's nothing fancy about Coco's. It's fast-food cafeteria style seating, but still with same yummy-in-my-tummy taste. While you're eating, take a gander at the box. It's full of quotes and stories to keep you entertained.  Now, what's a review about Coco Brooks without mentioning their fundraisers? I don't know how many times the order form used to show up on lunch room tables for another co-worker's offspring raising more than pizza dough for their school, but how can I not order some frozen Coco's to stash at home in my freezer?"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Coco Brooks when I was visiting my family and I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about.  The pizzas were good - we tried the option of take-and-bake, and I took the pizzas home that day to Edmonton to share with my boyfriend. I realized too late that the woman got my order wrong however, it was supposed to be two Ala Mo Wana Pizzas, and when I looked in the bag at home the pizza on the bottom was Beef and Mushroom... I was pretty disappointed with that but it's partly my fault for only checking the top pizza and not bottom one. By that time I was already in Edmonton so there was nothing I could do about it unfortunately.   The one Ala Mo Wana that we did try was good, and we picked off all the mushrooms on the other one and it was fine, nothing to be blown away by though.  Even though I should have checked my pizzas, I feel like this mixup was also a testament to the service there. From my experience it wasn't great. I was with my dad and he ordered 8 pizzas of his own and that was a struggle. The girl at the till didn't understand that we weren't there for pickup and just wanted take and bake. She tried to give us someone else's cooked order instead of starting a new one for us. When we finally got everything sorted out two of the pizzas were missing, and it was explained that they forgot to make them. So we were there for a total of about 40 minutes which is a lot considering we were the only people waiting for food, all other customers were simply eating.   I mean the pizza was good don't get me wrong, but like I said before - I'm not sure what the fuss is about. One good thing is that the prices are decent since they are personal pizzas, so about $6 a pie. But the service is questionable."}
{"text":"There are 3 Coco Brooks locations in Calgary:  - 32nd Avenue & 19th St. in the NE - Blackfoot & 42nd Avenue in the SE - 52nd St. & 48th Avenue in the SE  The only location I've been to is the one in the NE.  It is located right on 32nd Avenue in a plaza along with PM Hobby shop and Big Al's Aquarium.  When you enter Coco Brooks, it smells like fresh baked goodness!!  There is a big menu behind the cashier up on the wall and a huge selection to choose from.  They specialize in pizza, but also offer calzones, pastas, salads, ciabattas, fruits & veggies and dessert!!  For myself, I usually stick with the pepperoni mushroom pizza while Spence goes for the Louisiana chicken...once in a while we get a dessert pizza too!  After ordering, you get a number and wait for the staff to shout it out to tell you your order is ready.  You can dine in, take out or get it delivered.  We usually dine in for lunch.  The seating area is cafeteria style with up to 100 seats.  People usually just eat and go, so you are bound to find a spot.  Moving onto the pizza...I think it's a perfect size!  For me, it's filling but it's one of those things where you're super full but you continue to eat because it's just so good...the pepperonis are small but there's a lot on the pizza, the mushrooms are juicy, the cheese is stringy and the crust is crispy!  Spence and I always enjoy our pizzas from Coco Brooks.  There are many pizzas to choose from!  They even have veggie pizzas and gluten free, but the gluten free is only offered 'take n bake' (frozen) style.  Not to worry!!  I've had the take n bake and it's still just as good!  The instructions tell you to thaw before baking, but it works if you just throw it in the toaster oven frozen too!!  Same great taste!  Like I said above, once in a while we get the dessert pizzas...my favorite is the fruit pizza!  Banana bread with a layer of cream cheese and more banana bread and ...more cream cheese with fresh fruit on top!  It's definitely a Jenn pleaser!!  Coco Brooks is definitely Pizza Heaven and then some!  A large variety to choose from, great staff, good prices and delicious food!!!  If you haven't tried Coco Brooks, I'd say GO NOW!!  BEWARE: It can get pretty busy during lunch hours!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the people who work the counters have no idea what's going on. If they had better service is give them a five. But I found the girl working the front had no clue what was happening and came off condescending"}
{"text":"Pick up frozen take home pizza and save a bit from the regular price. Follow baking instructions at home and it tastes just as good at home!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. Personal sized, tons of toppings. A little light on the sauce, but that is my preference. The restaurant looks horrible. The dining room was filthy.   Half the tables were dirty, napkins and food on the floor, even though the place didn't look like it had been busy in quite a while. I agree with the person that said it had a cafeteria feeling.  Cheap plastic chairs, cheap wobbly tables.  1 small tv on the wall, otherwise no decorations.  If you judge a place by its looks, do not stop here.  If you want to get an excellent pizza to go, for a great price (pizza, drink and carrot cake for $10) this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I love coco brooks, we decided to order out for work and it was awesome. Every 10 pizzas you order, you get a free dessert. I love their Santa fe personal pizza.  Oh and don't forget the banzana bread.  We ordered 18 pcs. Of pizzas and they got every order correct. I would go back...totally"}
