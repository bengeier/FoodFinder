{"text":"We were waiting for my dishes over 20 mins. Finally we cancel our French Toast because they didn't start to make after 20 mins! I just saw that all staff including chief were eating beside our table! We pay money to enjoy meal, why we need to wait too long! Food not bad but not good ( 2 pts). Service just ok (2.5 pts, only 1 waitress was ok )! Over all 2 pts!"}
{"text":"I came here for family dinner (6 adults) on a Sunday and was hugely disappointed. There was a bug in our soup! A man in plain clothes (the manager?) came by and explained that their dried vegetables are sourced from China and that they have no control over the quality control overseas. He said sometimes bugs wind up in the food no matter how well they wash their vegetables beforehand. Seriously?!?! I was pregnant at the time so this was more than a bit disconcerting. They did not replace the uneaten soup and still charged us for it. The other dishes tasted OK (had to keep checking for bugs) but were WAY overpriced for their quality and presentation, especially in this area which is full of good, cheap Chinese restaurants.  To add insult to injury, the waitress brought us the bill before we even requested it. And then IMMEDIATELY after we paid (literally after handing back the card machine), the manager asked us to leave because it was crowded that night! INCREDIBLY rude, and simply inexcusable after we purchased a $160 meal."}
{"text":"I am a Chinese who born and grow up in Hong Kong. Hong kong style restaurant is my favourite and I m a big fan of it. That said, most of the Hong Kong style restaurant in toronto either does nt live up to my standard or too expensive. This restaurant is an exception. The price is not a very cheap one but it is very reasonable and the taste are great. Try the fry stick rice and onion sauce. It is great as a Hong Kong style dish."}
{"text":"Another average HK style cafe. Nothing special about the food really. Servings are decent but like everyone has mentioned, service is SLOW especially when its busy."}
{"text":"If you were looking for a casual HK meal, this used to be a decent place at reasonable prices. No more.   They no longer sell any western style dishes (baked dishes, breakfasts) and instead have an all-chinese menu, including lunch set menus starting at $45.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Good Standard hk style restaurant,large portion at cheap price,comfy sitting,recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered beef brisket rice noodle soup, no flavour. Worst noodle soup ever had.  Slow service."}
{"text":"Great HK cafe in Richmond Hill to grab all day Chinese breakfast! Not many places offer all day Chinese breakfast, so I love coming here for that. The prices are reasonable and offers good sized portions. Pretty much all meals comes with a hot milk tea or coffee. I have never tried the coffee but the hot milk tea is very smooth and flavourful.  Their lunch portions are pretty generous as well and can be split between 2 people if you both aren't two hungry. Again the lunches come with a free hot drink as well. Don't expect much out of the services as is with most Chinese restaurants. But this place is consistently busy especially around lunch hour, so I would suggest going there just before noon."}
{"text":"The lunch is like a Hong Kong Style cafeteria plus you can order dishes like dinner.  The quality is really average.  If I have to eat Hong Kong style lunch, there are better places.  For dinner, I like their set dinner with both the lobster and grouper.   The lobster is of 5 lbs, enough for a table of 10.  There are various ways of cooking it though some has to pay extra.  Quite some time the big lobster is sold out and has to settle for a smaller lobster.  It is delicious to have the big lobster as every piece is meat.  Tip: You can negotiate to exchange for another dish if the big lobster and trade in for a smaller one"}
{"text":"Not the first visit. Location is near Time square north of time square.  The four of us went for afternoon tea today.  Service is great as always.  We ordered 3 afternoon tea set and their signature dish shredded chicken.  Two of the tea set can get the red bean drink without paying extra.  The other one is regular drinks.  Total cost $50 excluding tips.  We ordered ???, which is my favourite for this store.  ????but they are out of rice noodles ??so we got spaghetti instead.  They cook it like ??????instead, but it taste pretty good so we don't even bother to tell them.  Also got ???????All the food taste good.  The chicken was a bit on the salty side but will be great with white rice.  I was too cheap to ask for their upgraded red bean jelly drink.  If you are ordering separately you should get it.  Highly recommend it.  Free wifi available. Can book table ahead of time. Their seafood dish is fresh too, especially if you tell them ahead of time when booking. Their Chinese soup is good too.  We couldn't finish the food, so we've got the fried rice home for later dinner.  I will return."}
{"text":"This place is not bad at all with reasonable price. They serve chinese wok food, and steam food, so don't expect something like chinese hk cafe style. Overall I like it, and it is good place for family or friends around 4 to 5 members to have dinner there. We had lobster, ox tail, and veg. The lobster was quite fresh. I would recommend to ppl who want dinner in a small group."}
{"text":"Busy Chinese restaurant in the Hwy7 Leslie area specializing in Cantonese style stir fries, seafood and homestyle cooking. Very busy so don't bother trying to come without a reservation on a weekend evening.  Complimentary soup and dessert for all customers - minimal / no msg. Similar to home cooking.  Most of the menu items on the wall are in Chinese. Many dishes have to be reserved in advance. Would be nice if there's a list of those speciality dishes so we can remember to call ahead.  Seafood tank is maintained well so have good confidence in their seafood dishes.   Ordered: Onion and ginger chicken - basically their steamed chicken with soy sauce like steamed fish. Very meaty, good quality and delicious.  Stir fried beef cubes with 2 kinds of mushrooms - most flavourful dish of the night. Comes with mushroom and king oyster mushrooms. Goes well with rice  Bok choy with double preserved egg sauce - too big for a small family. Not as flavourful or as tender as I imagined. Could be improved  Tiger prawns and pumpkin in egg yolk paste - very generous portion for price. Prawns are fried crispy and just the right amount of salted egg yolk paste for flavour. Pumpkin is a bit greasy but is soft. 10 big prawns in total for $25!  Other than the fact that it's super busy and the servers keep coming by to shoo you away, the restaurant serves decent food for the price as long as you're able to get a seat!"}
{"text":"First visit to Chi Star House was a disappointment.  Cons: - Seafood dishes come in small portion sizes and not true to the description.  Beware.  We ordered the lobster for $24.99, the single lobster was guaranteed to be 1.5lbs but it was closer to just 1 lbs or slightly over 1.  Definitely dud not meet the minimum of 1.5lbs.  When the staff was selecting the lobster, I heard them say the lobster shipment hasn't arrived yet, but then they pulled out two from the tank and brought it in to weigh.  I assume they knew those lobsters were too small but went ahead to serve it anyway. - Honey Pepper Oyster.  At $18.99, again the oysters were very small, only 2 out of 6 was a decent size.  Other restaurants have more generous portions for this price, such as Fancy on 14th and Kennedy. - Chestnut Pork Ribs, this dish was good but not spectacular. - Lotus in sauce, not bad tasting but very basic. - Meal does come wuth soup and dessert, which is good.  Place: interior is clean and more of a chinese cafe than restaurant.  Service: not bad but not great, just average.  Don't think I will come back for dinner but their lunch assortment is completely different. So maybe I will give it a second chance and try their cafe foods during lunch instead."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Treated like we were hobo begging for food, will never go back. We went twice during their afternoon tea special,  20 minutes before it ended, the waitress rudely said \"no, no more\" and she turned away."}
{"text":"Just another HK style cafe. I usually come here for lunch and they have a good variety of foods from noodles, breakfast items, chinese dishes and western dishes.  They renovated recently but I overheard that they only renovated the ceiling to add fans, chairs and inside the kitchen.   The food is just alright and what is expected from a HK style cafe. I ordered the baked ham and mushroom with cheese on spaghetti recently and the cream sauce itself was so watery. It was like eating spaghetti out of a noodle soup base. As well, I thought that they add too much cheese on top.  I would recommend staying away from their western spaghetti dishes after this encounter.  I like their beef fry noodles with egg sauce. Its probably my go to dish here.  Prices are cheaper than other HK style cafes out there and they give you a decent portion too. Oh, and they offer free wifi."}
{"text":"Chi Star is a real, authentic Cantonese food restaurant off Hwy 7 and Leslie. As one who grew up as a Cantonese, this restaurant reminds me of the taste at home. Unlike Canadian Chinese food, which most people not of Chinese origin won't be able to tell, they cater mostly to Chinese patrons who probably don't even consider say, chicken balls or chop suey Chinese food. Their dishes are on par with my expectation, price is fair, staff are friendly (perhaps only if you speak Cantonese/Mandarin?!). Most importantly, you get served free soup (not the kind with pure msg but with real meat and Chinese herbs), free rice for order over certain amount, and free red/green bean soup as dessert. Don't be overwhelmed or flustered by the tight space and constant crowds of people lining up during peak hours when you are dining."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea on a Sat evening.  Place was more packed than I expected.  Service was quick but food took a while to come out.  I could hear tables around me complaining as well.  So it seems like it is normally like this.  Food was decent for a Chinese diner, price was comparable to other diners for tea time.  Will come back for dinner or lunch next time as there was so good looking dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service. We arrived around 5:30PM on a Friday evening and had our selection of tables. The place is a little cramped but there is ample seating. By 6:30PM, the place was packed. Food was delicious and arrived quickly. I normally find bitter melon too bitter but even their spareribs and bitter melon was very good."}
{"text":"YUM. Fer reals. The food here is solid good for an HK Cafe and the crowds agree. The place is crazy busy for both lunch and dinner, and it's always best if you make a reservation. They have your usual HK Cafe options, as well some more homey foods - braised pork on salted cabbage for example (my dad's favourite). The service is rushed, and the seating is a bit odd (they have two rooms for the larger tables, but it's always packed and uncomfortable. And you feel like they've forgotten about you!).   I love their curries. Both are great options here - portions are a good size. The baked spaghetti is a little smaller than I'd like, with less sauce than I'd like. I want to come back and try a few more dishes, but we'll see if we can get a seat next time!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed that they no longer serve breakfast.   We tried to order pork Jowl with mushroom on rice and they said the chef hasn't arrive yet to make it.  This was at 10:45 am.  So they suggested we order noodles in soup.  We ordered pork Jowl with rice noodles in soup and they said they didn't have rice noodles so have to order egg noodles. Our noodles  didn't not arrive until 30 mins later."}
{"text":"If you ever have a craving for traditional Hong Kong Cafe Food, then this place is for you. They have anything you can hope for; from the cheap priced food to the weird service attitude.   Coming in, it is usually very busy, but this time, it wasn't that bad. Had a seat very fast. The environment is the same as some of the other cafes that I went to in HK. Nothing special, but not ugly either.   The service was bland. No smiles, nothing welcoming, but if you call them, they will show up. There are many waitresses for the size of the location, so if you call someone, they usually arrive very quickly.   Food is nothing special, but it isn't too expensive either. Standard place in my opinion. Overall, it is a bland place with a bland feeling. Nothing good to write home about, but nothing bad about the place either."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat if you are in a hurry and want something cheap. There was nothing good about this place. I highly recommend you not to come here. Did I say cheap earlier? It's definitely not cheap for the portion you're getting! The soup and food had a lot of msg.. It was like I had a bowl of Pho (except Pho taste so much better). Service was slow, too slow.. And just... Nothing good to say! No saving grace this time.."}
{"text":"Used to come to this place very often because they have decent food with an affordable price. However, their quality of food seems to be getting worse every time I go there. Their service is getting very bad as well. Their servers don't seem to care about their customers at all. They are too into chitchating among themselves. If you don't care about customer service and would like big portions with cheap price, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Tried the clams, not so great but the honey pepper beef was good! Decent for something fast"}
{"text":"I went to this place for my Family's Mid Autumn Festival dinner, which is one of the busiest days for Chinese restaurants in the year. Considering all those factors, this restaurant did particularly well, at getting our reservations correct, as well as the food in a timely manner. The service was a typical chinese restaurant, fast, and efficient.                  The food itself, most of the food was up to the usual standards of a good Cantonese style restaurant. the one dish in particular that was very good of course, was the maggie sauce Lobster. this was the main dish that has attracted us to come to this restaurant. it is not served in many other restaurants or done well. This is one of those must try for this restaurant. Another of the dishes that was very much on the top of our list is also the oyster, the sweet oyster that is fried, is very crunchy and tangy, it is a dish that a lot of restaurant has. but this restaurant definitely does a good job at it.                 Not every dish is good, the cube sirloin were average, as it wasn't as tender as it should be. This restaurant comes with a lot of cool combos for 2-8 people. this meals come with lobsters and free lobster fried rice as well as lobster steam egg. It is definitely cheaper and more affordable when compared with other lobster house places.                  This restaurant has definitely been one of my families go to places. Although it is not one of the fancier chinese restauarants in the area, it is a no frills place for dinner that covers all our needs. During lunch hours this restaurant turns into a HK cafe style restaurant. I would recommend anyone in the area who wants an affordable but good family meal to come to this place."}
{"text":"We've come here for dinner a few years ago and decided to try lunch. My mom heard/read about the XO beef fried rice noodle (XO ????being good so we got that. The noodles were good in that they weren't oily or too moist but the beef was spottily marinated and she got one that was overly salty.   We also tried the baked pork chop tomato sauce rice (??????) and the sauce was too think and by the time it got to our table it had coagulated with a film on top. Not very appetizing based on looks alone and the flavour was better at ???.   My spam and egg sandwich was ok but the bread was very dry. Golden Phoenix has much better bread.   Milk tea wasn't strong enough (watered down) and the iced lemon tea was average.   Pretty average HK style cafe."}
{"text":"This is one of my no frills choice for Chinese dishes to go with rice lots of variety and good wok hei the place is small and packed especially on weekends so better make reservations service is good and friendly dishes are good size and dinner comes with comp soup and dessert soup and the end. Sweet and sour pork 3/5 Steam pork patty 3/5 Shredded chicken 3/5"}
{"text":"Came during peak lunch time with a group of 10 people.  We were given a table almost immediately.  The waitress was very friendly and patient with us as it was our first time here and we studied the menu (so different from what other yelpers have experienced).  The food was decent and they had something my very picky eater son actually ate and liked, so I was happy.  It can be hard to travel with an extremely picky eater, but their menu offered something for every palate."}
{"text":"2.5***  So many Hong Kong style cafes opening lately I can't even catch up. Since its closeby and saw Jennifer K. Review it i decided to come here for brunch today.  Ordered: the satay beef vermicelli with 2 eggs and 2 slices of toast... $4.99 only.. quite a deal i would hafta say.... quite alot of beef slices with heavy satay sauce.   Family member ordered eggs with corned beef sandwich.. @ 3.99...average price   The pricing is acceptable. Food quality is ok.. nothing memorable that would make me desperately wanna come back. Jus an average hk style cafe....  10% off during grand opening"}
{"text":"Decent HK style food and reasonably priced.  I find the dinner quality is better than lunch and breakfast, but it gets really busy so wait time can be long. The service is quite bad.  We waited 15 minutes before someone would give us the menu and teas.  Then, when we were done, we got plenty of unfriendly stares from servers thinking we were hogging the table, but in fact, we asked for the bill 10 minutes ago.  If they felt that strongly to have a staring contest with us, next time just ask us what's wrong!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner...be prepared to wait as lines can last about 30mins...they do take reservations for large groups but you still may need to wait when arriving for your reservations.  Good variety of Chinese food...all the dishes we ordered were tasty which included lobster, chicken, beef tenderloin, bitter melon, pea shoots, and string beans. It included free soup to start the dinner and also free dessert! Price is reasonable and service is quick & friendly.  I did have a beer (Coors Light) and it was cheap, only $3.50!  Overall, you can't really go wrong...food is pretty good and consistent...prices are fair...service is efficient. I'd recommend if you're looking for something simple and nothing extravagant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on new years day. The place was fairly busy but we were seated right away.   Tried a few different dishes here: Baked fish + rice with creme and spinach sauce Lemon grass pork chop with rice Fried seafood udon Satay beef in noodle soup with eggs and toast on side  All dishes came with drink and we all got milk tea  All the dishes were pretty good and comparable to other HK style cafes. The pork chop dish was really the only thing that stood out for me. There were 2 large pieces of pork chop and it was soft and tender.  Service was quick. All dishes were under $10 and the one breakfast dish we got was less than $6 so price wise its an affordable place to grab some quick grub."}
{"text":"Can't say I am too impressed with this place for service - even with a Chinese run restaurant.   Food was ok, I had their fried e-fu mien and it wasn't too bad. Their fried rice noodles in xo sauce looked more intriguing - but our friend's hoi lam chicken rice dish was missing the requisite soup that comes with the dish and when we had asked after the soup - the kitchen gave us a bowl of the borcht instead - which was odd.   Few notes - the VIP rooms are not very VIP at all as they are separated from the main dining area, which you might say is the whole point of having a VIP room. However in this case, VIP meant out of sight and mind.  It was surprisingly busy for a Monday that was a non-holiday - so it maybe the reason for the so-so service.   Also the set meals come with either daily soup or drink, not both if you are used to the typical HK style tea cafes in Toronto."}
{"text":"Average Chinese fast-food restaurant.  I must say that before a lot of people discovered this place, the service was a little better.  Today, they neglected to pack my drinks with my take-out portion of the food.  The Hainan chicken rice was also way too salty today but traditionally, it has been mediocre.  XO sauce beef rice noodle is pretty good.  Unfortunately - very atypical of Asian restaurants, service is quite slow when it's busy."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Chi Star House is located beside the famous Inatei, and you would probably spend a quarter of the amount you would otherwise spend in Inatei. It's a HK style cafe restaurant during the day, and more of a traditional Chinese restaurant at night.  I came here for dinner with two others, and we only ordered three dishes as we weren't that hungry: BBQ duck with plum sauce, general tso's fish, and shredded chicken. Nothing was terrible, but nothing really stood out. The prices were also quite low (but not crazily low like Ocean/Hai Tang).  Service was very good for a typical Chinese establishment; I didn't need to wave anyone down for any sort of requests the entire time I was there. However, I had nothing that I ate which attracted me to coming back, at least for dinner."}
{"text":"- Dinner Review Only: 3.5/5 stars - I can't speak for lunch service and menu items since I have only been to Chi Star House for dinner a few times. Overall the Chinese entrees/dishes will satisfy your cravings. Big fan of their sweet and sauce pork, enough said!   I love their 5 spice duck since the duck is very flavourful and tender. Typically you have to preorder the duck, and they will make 1-2 more ducks in addition to reservations. So if you're lucky, you might get to try this duck dish without preordering!   I also love how they can cook 1 eel and serve it in 2 different methods. The first is steamed with black bean sauce. Again, very flavourful and the eel is cooked perfectly! The second method is fried with salt and pepper. The eel is deboned and there is a perfect crunch!   It lost 0.5 stars because... it's hard to get service sometimes especially on a full night. You might end up waiting a long time until they refill your teapot. This place can get pretty packed for dinner, especially on the weekends, so expect the wait!"}
{"text":"Cheap greasy food that is filled with MSG....I was so thirsty after eating their food, even tho their prices are cheap I rather save my money and pay a bit more to eat somewhere else then this crap"}
{"text":"Typical chinese diner/ cha chan teng that serves breakfast, individualized or family style lunch and dinner dishes.  Not very spectacular unless you are looking for a quick no-need-to-think meal.  However, few items to keep in mind: Breakfast (egg sandwich, satay beef macaroni, ham and egg instant noodles... etc) - ranges from $6.50 to $8.50 not inclusive of add-ons (substitution costs or drinks on ice cost)  Lunch - had the family style lunch where I ordered 3 dishes to share with family of 4 (eggplant with meat sauce, beef brisket, seafood with veg).  Dishes comes with a side bowl of rice.  I eat low sodium so I do find dishes a bit salty; may not be easily noticeable with regular diners.  Dishes range at $10.99 each but portions do not match this value nor the taste.  Service - when there is line it is usually expected of cha chan teng staff to give you a number.  No one got numbers so wait time is fairly unknown.  Once seated and trying to order, the wait staff spend more time looking around than attend to the table even if they have already started writing orders.  One fast thing is that they do give water and cutlery fast :).  Noticed that they do let patrons jump the line if they know the person as a regular  Would I come back? Probably not since same dishes at most cha chan tengs"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place over the weekend for breakfast.  Let's just say, with My Kitchen literally next door, it had a tough act to follow.    Pros: Portions are good  Cons: Food is average at best Very dirty under the tables  I'm a little biased here maybe because one of ma favourite places for breakfast is just next door.  We decided to try this place to see how it was like.  When you walk in, the place is pretty big.  There are a lot of tables so wait times are almost never a problem.  We are seated very quickly.  Taking a look at the menu, I see there are actually very few breakfast specials.  They have 5 items and 4 of them include congee.  The menu also says any special with congee does not come with a drink.  That's a drag because I'm used to any special always coming with a drink.  Also, there's a completely separate special menu but it's all in Chinese.  There's no English anywhere on it whatsoever.  I'm always against all Chinese menus even though I'm can read them myself.  When you're a business in Canada, you need to have English included in your menu plain and simple.    I ordered the beef brisket noodle and my GF had the french toast with \"beef cookie\" which was ordered from the all Chinese menu.  For those who don't speak Chinese, I translated \"beef cookie\" directly from Chinese.  This item is usually ground beef that's steamed in a round (cookie-like) shape.  However, when we received the French toast, it just came with ham.  We have a word for ham in Chinese but it's not beef cookie.  I guess they couldn't be bothered to change the menu or something.  My brisket noodle was alright.  The bowl was pretty big and it came with a lot of noodles.  The brisket though was mainly fatty pieces.    Halfway through the meal, my little one dropped her cup under the table.  When I went to pick it up, I noticed how dirty it was.  The floor was basically covered in dirt and filth in the corners.  I couldn't give back the cup to my little one after.  It was a complete turn off.  So all in all, i think i'm going to stick with My Kitchen next door.  I just wasn't impressed with this place at all.  I may have been more critical because of the competition next door, but when you do have competition you should step up your game to meet or exceed it.  Chi Star did not unfortunately."}
{"text":"First time coming here for a seafood/Chinese dinner..ordered typical dishes such as sweet & sour pork, deep fried lobster, fish/tofu, etc. I have previously come here for the lunch combos and they are pretty decent.  Meals are served with daily soup & sweet dessert soup.  We were mainly excited about the scallops (shell included) which were priced at $8/each. You get a choice of garlic or black bean.   When our scallops arrived.. we were shocked to find that they were PLACED into the shell.. it was a complete scam as they charged a premium for the scallops but all we were served were mediocre frozen scallops."}
{"text":"Overall, 2.5 stars.. would prefer to not come again..  There was nothing wrong with our meal... dinner for 7 including tip was $350..  Let's forget about the price, just food review  Ordered a 4lb lobster.. 2 stars (fail) Lobster was not 4lbs.. probably around 3.2lbs Not even garlic  Hand rip chicken 2 stars Poor garnish, just didn't look or taste delicious..  XO stir fry Clams 2 stars Although clams can be eaten raw, it is expected to be cooked 100% when going stir-fry style. Not everyone of us were able to eat it  Fresh Steamed Tilapia was over cooked   Other dishes were ok... had a few issues with he kitchen being slow so we ended up waiting for food..  Nothing was out of the ordinary.. definitely not worth $50 per person.."}
{"text":"This place is packed. Came here for dinner and they are really disorganised. They crossed off our spot on the list and if my party hadn't seen it happen, they would have thought we'd left. Constant streams of people arguing with the servers about not being seated so they get even more confused because it's a new person yelling at them. No real organised queue list here.  We ordered our dishes. One of which was a steamed whole fish. It makes sense if they run out as it is a busy holiday and lots of people are ordering. But she forgot to put in our order, so it was about another 30 minutes before the first dish arrived. We weren't in a rush, but still, it was difficult enough to get the attention of a server as they're severely understaffed.  Not sure I'd want to wait that much time and deal with that disorganization again."}
{"text":"all their dishes don't LOOK that great, but they all taste good!!!!!! :D  would have been a solid 4* but they forgot one of our dishes, and even after a couple times of asking them to check up on it, it took the third lady to finally actually do it and notice that it wasn't punched in :( so we got it after we were pretty much done our meal."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars/5 stars. This restaurant is like a family go-to Chinese restaurant. The prices are very good and the food is not too heavy and similar to Chinese home cooked meals. They have a large menu and a lot of different options to pick from.   It was very busy on the Saturday night, so reservations should be made in advance. The service was very good and the waiters couldn't have been more kind and helpful. It is not a fancy restaurant but more of a casual Chinese restaurant.   I would recommend this place to some friends. I would revisit this place, but there are better Chinese restaurants out there but for the great prices, it's worth a check!"}
{"text":"Change of ownership. The food quality has changed. Most dishes are not too salty but very oily. The wok chief uses alot of oil in all dishes. This place also used to be a HK style cafe during lunch service. This is no longer the case. I mean, who would get a lobster for lunch special? I guess some people would. The lunch menu is disappointing. All dishes that are serve are mostly for dinner.   I really hope they would read this review and bring the lunch menu back. They used to have a good bake chicken rice."}
{"text":"Excellent home cooked Cantonese food. Don't trust the naysayers. Wtf expects service at a Chinese Redtaurant."}
{"text":"Chi Star House just open 2 days ago..   I expect confusion during the first week or so when a business opens up. So this review is based on their soft opening and trying to figure things out.  The open concept deco is really simple. The space feels really spacious and inviting. Tons of booth seating which is great for small group.  Chi Star House is kind of a mixture of Cantonese and Hong Kong Style Cafe. With breakfast (8-11), lunch (11-3), afternoon tea (2:30-5:30) and dinner (5- 11 pm). All time slot has set special available the includes a drink or a soup.  Arriving at 6 pm looking for something light and the waitress gave me a regular menu that only have dishes that are good for groups... I feel really not single friendly. I should have left but ended up suck it up and ordered Satay Beef with Vermicelli in Hot Pot ($7.99). The portion was really good at that price point but just lack satay taste and the sizzling hot pot factor.  While talking to another waitress complaining about the lack of other options during dinner. She said they have noodles, fried rice and even all day special from $4.99!!!! Ended up I was not given the special menu and they didn't realize that the all day menu is grouped under breakfast.....  I guess I need to come back and try out their $4.99 special... but for now 2.5 star rounded up to 3 with room for improvement!!"}
{"text":"I came here in November with a group of four for a weekend lobster lunch special that was advertised in newspaper. The lobster was steamed with garlic and tasted really good, though personally I prefer the ones at Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse in Scarborough. We also ordered a seafood congee, snow pea tips, and steamed chicken. All of the dishes tasted great. The interesting thing about the chicken was that it the skin was very yellow, which I haven't seen before, but tasted very fresh. The restaurant was fairly packed, and service was slow."}
{"text":"I've been to Chi Star House several times and the most frustrating thing is the wait and seating arrangements. It's not unusual for Chinese restaurants to give preferential seating to frequent customers, but this place takes it to a whole new level. Every time I come, I could feel my blood pressure going up. I want to write about 2 specific experiences.   The first time, I arrived around 7 pm for a party of 3 and we're told that the wait was about 30 min. In the end we waited for more than 1 hr +, not because turnover was slow, but because they kept combining small tables every time they became available to accommodate bigger groups. This is because they generate more revenue per person from bigger groups. After they did that for about the 5th time, I was quite livid and yelled at the general manager, after which we were seated fairly quickly.  The second time, we arrived around 7:30 pm with a party of 3. Not sure if the general manager recognized me from our last encounter, but he repeatedly reassured us that our wait should only be 10-20 min. Of course, that was not the case. At one point, his in-laws scooped in and took a table by jumping the line, and he had to profusely apologize for the extra wait. Everyone waiting is so riled up because they do such a poor job managing expectations of wait times.   I give this place a 2 star because the food is pretty good at a reasonable price. However, I would highly recommend coming really early (before 6 pm) or late (after 9 pm) to avoid this waiting/seating fiasco. Also, if they give you a wait time estimate, be mindful that it will likely take twice or three times as long."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the bad reviews!  My family and I love this place - as do all of our Chinese friends.  You can't expect much from service - it's pretty much on par with all other Chinese places that are about high turnover.  Actually, their servers can be downright frosty-faced most of the time.  And if you come when it's busy, the wait can be atrocious (so make a reservation for weekend dinners!).  The food though, is always reliably delicious.  Authenticity is a given.  But their Chinese dishes (\"siu chow\") are just right!  Sweet and sour pork is delicious (and stays crispy til the end of the meal), their meat pies/patties are delicious and hand-chopped, which is the traditional \"right way\" of making it (try the one with squid!), their stir-fried veggies (gai lan) with preserved meats is delicious as is their ginger stir-fried gai lan, their fish and tofu pot (hung siu ban lam) is awesome...we almost never have anything here that we don't like.  Prices are reasonable, though not dirt cheap.  We come here often for \"proper\" Chinese food and especially for things we don't make at home."}
