{"text":"Went for lunch and then again for a few drinks.  The food is fresh and the coffee does its job.  They also have a good beer selection and different drink specials every day of the week.  The bar tender was nice and outgoing."}
{"text":"Finally got out to give this place a try. We ordered two coffees, one Carmel iced latte and one white chocolate mocha macchiato, both with a robust coffee flavor unlike any chain you'd order an iced drink at. Ordered the hummus & pimento plate, which was more than enough for two people. Served with cucumber and carrot sticks and warm, crispy biscuits. Flavors in the hummus were spot on, but the pimento cheese could use some work. More kick and less sweet, maybe more pimento, too!! This place has a lot of potential. I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This spot just opened so I figured I'd stop in and give it a try. So glad I did. My cappuccino was SO good that when I finished my first cup I immediately ordered a second. I ordered the chocolate cappuccino. I had to do some work stuff on my computer (they have wifi which is super convenient) so I ordered a lox bagel and I was really impressed. The staff was very sweet and helpful. The manager, Taylor, introduced herself and showed me around. It has so much character! A lounge and a pool table. A great place to come to any time of day in my opinion. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast there and had a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. Incredible and coffee is robust but smooth. Great experience. It's lounge so would imagine a great place at night."}
{"text":"Terrible. We ordered breakfast for delivery and the 2 orders of chicken and waffles was aweful! Soaked in grease! My kids couldnt even eat it. They also gave the delivery driver a hard time on the 2 missing items that they foregot to put in our order. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The perfect place to grab breakfast or lunch along with supporting a local business. 
If you have the chance, ask for Taylor the GM of this place. Awesome conversation and a great leader for sure."}
{"text":"Walked down to grab a beer a little before 9 on a Monday night. Thanks for closing an hour early."}
{"text":"Stopped in for coffee and breakfast, and am pumped about this place! They have an excellent menu. They have \"grab n go\" items on breakfast and lunch menus that are fairly priced and a great option for folks who work locally and need a quick bite. We had the breakfast strata which was delicious, a couple of lattes -yummy- and an emulsion coffee (get it, it's amazing!).. we ended up staying for a drink because the service was so good and friendly we weren't ready to leave. Thanks and we look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place during the week for a quick bite or business meeting .. Cocktails and craft beer are all on point!
Check out the wine list- you won't be disappointed with the food or service!"}
{"text":"Really low key kinda place during the day seem like. But it apparently opens early and closes later than most one area. Definitely will return and often."}
