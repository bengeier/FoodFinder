{"text":"I love fish and chips and this is the best shop I have found in the west end of the city.  I am a regular here.  Great Fish and chips at reasonable prices.    The Halibut and Cod are delicious.  The fish is freshly battered.   Haddock is good....but not as good as Cod or  Halibut.  Chips are fresh cut.   The staff are very friendly, portions are generous.  Decor is casual.....no internet.     

They have an Alaskan Pollock special (7.99)  that I have tried once and would not recommend....seemed to be as much batter as fish."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for a long time. The kids love it. The portions are huge. I always end up taking some home. But not as good as fresh made."}
{"text":"This was among the top 3 fish and chips I've ever had in my life. The fish was just unreal, the fries tasted fresh, and it was a huge portion for $11. I'm super picky about coleslaw though, and while this place was one of the better ones I've tried, I still didn't care for it. Their tartar sauce was a little too pickle-y, but the fish was so incredible that I didn't even end up having any. The waitress was great, and we chatted with the chef a bit too. Can't wait to go back here, and next time I'll be trying the supposedly famous house-made mushy peas. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times in the last couple of years and  I can't say that we've ever been disappointed.  The cod was incredible but so was the halibut on previous visits.  The fries are fresh cut and excellent.  Friendly service and owner.  Even has free parking. Really don't have anything bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips (and mushy peas). Popped in whilst in the area the other night and was not disappointed! Great fish with light crispy batter(I had haddock) and delicious mushy peas. Massive portion of chips. Well recommended"}
{"text":"Good Fish & Chips. Halibut, Haddock and Whitefish. Good value. 
In response to another Yelper about having to ask for tartar sauce. I don't use tarter sauce so why should a restaurant automatically put it in my bag and then I will toss it. I prefer malt vinager"}
{"text":"You know that night of the week when you and your significant other get home from a busy day at work, your exhausted, hungry and the thought of cooking actually makes you want to cry? Well we had one of those days last week and after a busy month of take out/eating out while we prepared to move we were not looking forward to another pizza or paying $70 for dinner for two.

We hopped in the car to explore the local neighbourhood and I saw Longbranch F&C. Sachi (my lady) is a huge fan of Fish and Chips and I won't say no to them either so being literally at the end of our street we decided to check them out.

You don't want to judge this book by its cover because yes it's a little dated, but so is the neighbourhood. That doesn't take away from the fact that this place is serving up some great eats at very fair prices.

We decide to do take out and went for a halibut and chips each. Battered and cooked while I waited and ready in about 10 minutes. While the food was cooking I got a chance to chat with the owner, I told him we'd just moved to the area and he immediately wiped his hands off came over and shook my hand and welcome me to the area!! Who does that? Such a class act!

Out two dinners were ready shortly there after and came out to a mere $30 and change plus tip - very reasonable. Got it home and everything was still crispy and not soggy at all - my favourite part was that they wrapped the fish and chips in newspaper just like the old school places!!

The meals were massive! Honestly, in future we're ordering one F&C dinner (fish and chips) and one order of fish (no chips) we had enough fries between the two of us to feed a family of 5!!! Crazy! Halibut is my favourite Fish to have but also the smallest portion so in coming back here again, I would definitely order an extra piece of fish!

Gotta love this local joint for quick takeaway or dine in - they seem to have lots of regulars! Check it out

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! We were in the area on a Saturday afternoon in need of a lunch.  This place totally hit the spot.  The fish was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and has solid fries.  We had the haddock and the halibut, and both were tasty.  Our server was very nice, as was the chef who chatted up our 3 year old a bit.  They even recommended half servings of fries since their servings were generous, and saved us a bit of $ by recommending their special based on what we ordered.  Yum! :)"}
{"text":"Great fish & chips. Cod, haddock, halibut, and shrimp are all well worth the price you pay. Plus the owner is a great guy to chat up!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. This place is bright and clean. I had halibut and my husband had haddock. Both were cooked to order and nice and crisp, with the batter being light and not greasy. The portions are very generous (we had to take some home, next time will order one fish without chips and one with chips.) The menu is limited, but well worth a trip. Friendly owner-chef who prepares food in open kitchen"}
{"text":"First time my wife and I ate here was a month or two ago. Didn't realize they were about to close, but staff was incredibly friendly and insisted we stay for our meal. 

We got two specials, and everything was awesome. Batter was light and crispy, fish was moist, chips were nice and chunky, tartar sauce and coleslaw were to die for. Everything seems to be made in-house, including the tartar sauce (none of that bland tear-open-pack stuff). Portions are insane in the best way possible. I'm a man with an appetite, and the last couple chips are always a struggle.

First impressions were great, but the *exceptionally* friendly staff, good food, and great value for money is what keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"BEST fish and chips in the city!!! Reminds me of the chips we used to get in Scotland when I was growing up. My husband had the fish and says it's the best he has had in a loooong time. Staff are extremely friendly, especially Bradley the chef/cook.  i would hire him for any job, anytime. Great customer service skills!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for fish. Drove by with a friend of mine, hankering for some fried fish. Not really a fan of fries in general, so just ordered two pieces of haddock. It really hit the spot. Glad they have the fish doubly wrapped in paper to soak up all the grease."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and food was really good we had the Cod which I have been against eating for quite awhile due to the overfishing, however I couldn't wait any longer. I also had the poutine which is one of the best purines in Etobicoke, Honestly made with two types of cheese curds and a nice thick gravy. I enjoyed my meal and the restaurant that has a very old school look and feel to it, might have something to with the fact they haven't updated or renovated since at least the 80's. I like these places that focus more on the food then the look of the place. If you are looking for a good quick meal I would hit this place up for sure."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding ,the staff is always so cheerful and pleasant.they go above and beyond to make your experience amazing. it has that warm personalble feeling to it makes no difference if taking it to go or eating in the food and the staff treat you amazing.portions are huge very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers. The server was very uninformed and quite rude.   We ordered 3 polock lunch specials and one halibut special.  All the fish were overcooked (dry and more like fish jerky).  The fries were OK but not seasoned and quite bland.  I will try out different fish and chips in area before considering returning."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is pretty good. Even the sizes are pretty interesting, no pun intended. I would rate this place higher, but I hate the fact that the dude is stingy with his tartar sauce. They don't give it to you unless you ask for it, which makes me ask the question, who the &%@# eats fish and chips without tartar sauce?"}
