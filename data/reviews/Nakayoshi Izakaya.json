{"text":"I love this place. I'm almost here every week. I'm here for the ramen as I see this restaurant as more of a ramen shop than an Izakaya. Service is so good. The ladies do speak English but I can always practice my japanese here. I recommend the spicy miso ramen. It perfectly seasoned not too salty. If you're not in the mood for ramen, the karaage, kaki fry, nabeyaki and Zaru soba were very good. Shouga icecream is recommended too. I always watch Japanese TV there too which is a plus."}
{"text":"Toronto has been building a long list of ramen restaurants, most of them noisy and over-hyped. This one is a refreshing surprise: creamy tonkotsu broth *without* a horde of hipsters screaming at each other over Ramune and vodka. The noodles, broth, and toppings here are the real deal. The noodles are bouncy, chewy, and curly (the Holy Trinity of Ramen), and the broths have silken body without being too sticky or cloying. The tonkotsu broth was amazingly milky and rich but smooth, without any annoying globules of fat. The shoyu broth was tangy, with an underlying fermented funk that stood up to the saltiness of the broth. And the portion size was just right: big enough to turn a late lunch into a supper, but not such a boatload of noodles that things got mushy by the end. 

I've been to Kinton, and Kenzo, and Guu, and I can honestly say Nakayoshi's ramen is better. It's not gimmicky, it's not crowded, and they do Japanese home-cooking classics like curry rice, oyako-don, and yakiniku. The prices are reasonable, the ingredients are quality, and the technique is on point. I really hope they stick around."}
{"text":"I love this place. Love the Tonkotsu Ramen or Shio Ramen on a winter day is great. Compared with many other Japanese restaurants on Danforth and in the annex, this place deserves a good rating for the price point and service and reliability. Much better noodles than Kenzo in the annex and many other places that supposedly specialize in Ramen."}
{"text":"Still maintaining it's quality after about 4 years. This is still our favourite place in the area for more quality or authentic Japanese food. Have tried more of the extensive menu now and it is quite consistent. Over the years have had various ramen, udon, soba, black cod, grilled eggplant, sushi, ohitashi (spinach), and more. Had the Katsu Curry Rice today and really enjoyed it. Steady clientele but not so packed that you have to be reserving or lining up which is a relief with kids. And they get free ice cream!"}
{"text":"We love this place and go at least twice a month. The chef worked in Japan for a long time, and the dishes taste authentic - which we can't say for most places on the danforth."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, and eat here frequently.  The ramen is fantastic - I almost always get either the katsu ramen or the karaage ramen.  My partner raves about the miso ramen.  The food always tastes fresh and homemade and the atmosphere is pleasant; it's a quiet enough to have a conversation and the staff never rushes you.  It is by far the best Japanese restaurant on the Danforth.  You can get a ramen card and get the 10th one free if you're a regular.

It is kid friendly, but may be a problem if you are disabled.  There is one step up to the restaurant, the washroom (nice and clean) is on the main floor."}
{"text":"My mommy friend and I ventured to this place nestled between Pape and Donlands subway station to try out their Ramen. We ventured in with our two strollers to find the place very spacious and the waitress very accomodating.  They are very kid friendly and had a few high chairs on hand. 

So we decided to order two Ramens - the Katsu Ramen and the Fried Chicken Ramen.  Both came with the breaded cutlet and fried chicken served on the side. The Ramen was very good served with some seaweed, half an egg, some Japanese type of processed seafood, and some sparse veggies. The consistency of the noodles were good, the broth was hot and savory, and it was served with a side of chili flakes if more hot-ness was required.

They brought a separate cup with a straw for my toddler and did not give us scathing looks when he flung his entire lunch onto the ground.

The service was great. The waitress was very pleasant and polite. Water and tea re-fills were plenty.  The cost was also quite reasonable. $32 for a lunch for 2.

It is a 4 star for me as I have had better Ramen in HK (not yet anywhere else in Toronto that compares). I have not tried any of their sushi/sashimi dishes or Izakaya type of dishes so cannot compare. Overall, we were very satisfied with the place and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Top notch Japanese with real style and grace. I will definitely return with friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"The quality of the Japanese food is superior - of course, the restaurant is owned by Japanese and they know their food. The decor is nice, the service friendly and efficient, the seating comfortable and roomy. You don't have to endure other people's conversation. Don't miss the ramen. One of the best in town."}
{"text":"Top notch ramen (went for spicy miso) that is packaged meticulously. The soup base and ingredients harmonize well together to make a ramen you will go back for."}
{"text":"Finally something better than mediocre Japanese on the Danforth! This place is great - the noodles soups are clearly their specialty, and they are spectacular. The sushi pizza is also fabulous. They're located on the wrong side of Pape, unfortunately, but once Danforth people discover it, it's going to boom. It's terrific."}
{"text":"Great service, OK food, good prices. The most disappointing thing so far was the Ebi Fry, which was from frozen breaded shrimp you can buy in the supermarket. I get the sense the non-mainstream menu items are better, so maybe skip the ramen and try some of the other noodle soups.

Haven't tried the sushi yet, as I would rather go across the street to Aji Sai."}
{"text":"Went here today for dinner. Me and a friend were at \"the only cafe\" for a beer when we got hungry. Btwn the two of us we ordered edamame, spicy crab salad, yam tempura, salmon sushi pizza, and cucumber rolls. We each had a bottle if beer too- our bill was $59 without tip. We were both full. Quality was better than most sushi places. This is more of a Japanese restaurant, the selection is much more than just sushi. Place was very clean and well decorated. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I love Nakayoshi! This is my favourite spot for Japanese food on the Danforth. 

THE GOOD:
- I've tried several different items on the menu, and everything I've ordered has been delicious. We usually stick to the ramen bowls (~$9.50 plus tax), which are awesome value and the foodie equivalent of a big, warm hug. We've also tried their tonkatsu entr√©e (~$13.50 plus tax), which comes with rice and and the most scrumptious curry sauce. There's also sushi, Japanese-style seafood \"pizzas\" and more. 
- As a starter, I also love their veggie spring rolls - and they're just $3! 
- Service is quick and pleasant - I've never waited more than 15 minutes for our food to come out. 
- The inside is nothing to write home about, but warm and pleasant with Japanese-inspired decor and paintings on the walls. 
 
THE BAD:
- I'm docking one star because while Nakayoshi is surely a hit with East York residents, I'm not convinced that it's the best ramen in the city. If I could give half-stars, I'd give Nakayoshi 4.5/5. 

To conclude, I'm definitely a Nakayoshi fan and I will continue to come back when my ramen cravings strike and I don't want to venture too far from home. Danforth folks, be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"Nakayoshi has by far the best Japanese food in the East End of Toronto / on the Danforth. They are one of the few in the city still owned by Japanese people. Lots of Vegetarian /Vegan options!"}
{"text":"A Japanese run restaurant with an extensive menu but it seems to be a case of spreading themselves too thin. We tried many Japanese izakaya classics like shishamo, cod cheek, goma-ae and shoyu and tonkatsu ramen. None of these dishes was above a 5/10 sadly. The amaeebi was ok. There is however a very good shochu and sake menu. 

Decor is overly bright and a bit cheap. TVs seem like a holdover from whatever it was before and in general there is no true izakaya vibe at all. This could be easily fixed by turning half the lights off, the TVs and some rock n roll instead of jazz. 

I know the chef is trying to provide all the choices of a big Japanese restaurant but this area cannot support a restaurant of this style. I hope for his and our sake that he reduces the menu by 2/3rds and focusses on his very best dishes. I will go back in 2 months to do a follow up. 

All this said, the food is still better than Guu."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Service is fast, nice and friendly. I typically order the small plates such as sushi pizza, tempura, black cod, mackerel etc. All are done really really well. The sushi pizza is quite delicious. The tempura is spot-on, very light coating, not greasy at all. I have eaten the sushi and the sashimi and both are fresh, tasty and I like that they don't drench the specialty rolls in mayo. The fish and rice are always at the forefront. I always return as they are a great restaurant for our hood."}
{"text":"Ordered shoyu ramen, miso ramen and the agadashi tofu.  The tofu was good but for some reason it was put in a bowl with far too much broth or sauce or whatever was in the liquid pool.  The ramen was okay.  I have had better elsewhere.  Service was okay. We had to go up to pay as the two women were busy chatting and checking their phones."}
{"text":"After searching for a place nearby for good ramen (and I've had some reeally good ramen) my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. The ramen was exceptionally good for an izakaya, the sushi was good too. It's hard to find a place that does both, especially both done well. The service was also prompt and place was relatively clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Not sure why it's so empty during lunch time, but I hope they will survive. A small place on the Danforth, they serve less Izakaya stuff, but more hot japanese food like rice bowls and ramen. 

Despite the growing ramen trend, there haven't been much in the East side of town. I like their ramen, the noodles dense and bouncy, with lots of different flavours $8-12. It's not mind blowing, but if you're in the area worth a try."}
{"text":"It was literally my first time eating ramen so I have no idea if it's \"good ramen\" but the food here was absolutely delicious and was cheap. I got inari ramen which was basically tofu and noodles in soy sauce broth. It was topped with seaweed, egg, bamboo shoots, and narutomaki. The broth was very flavourful and the toppings were all delicious. The noodles had a really good bite and texture. I ordered a refill of noodles because I liked them so much and still had broth. I had the house sake which was cheap in price and tasted fine but was like any other house sake. I finished with the green tea cheesecake which was lightly sweetened and a great end to the meal. I had the soup (8.50), a whole order of extra noodles (2.00), 6 oz of sake (5.00), and cheesecake (3.00) and the bill with tax came to just over $20. Great value for dinner. Cutting out the booze and dessert would be a great cheap lunch too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"As far as Japanese food on the Danforth goes, Nakayoshi is pretty good; they offer options beyond the typical tempura/bento/teriyaki fare found in places further west along the Danforth. I saw okonomiyaki and takoyaki on the menu!

However, when compared to ramen/izakayas downtown, Nakayoshi is lacking a bit. While the ramen was not bad, it lacked the depth of flavour and richness Ive come to associate with a hearty bowl of miso ramen (perhaps Im just used to the oiliness of Kinton). The noodles were alright; could have been a bit thicker and chewier for my taste. The chicken karaage was mediocre; although crisp, the chicken was on the drier side and the batter was thick. 

Tonight, service was slow, even though the dining room was not busy. The servers didnt seem knowledgable about menu items; when we asked whether certain items were vegetarian or dairy free, the servers hesitated and seemed to guess about the contents of the dishes."}
{"text":"I had the shoyu ramen. It seemed ok but before I even finished eating I felt nauseated. I rushed to the washroom and threw up. Sorry to be gross. I should've questioned how fresh the food was considering the place was empty during what should have been the lunch rush. I felt so terrible so I just paid and left. I didn't feel up to an argument. Btw, I felt fine before and after, so I'm sure it was the food.  Never again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the entire experience here. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I had the Sandi Soba Ramen and the Nakayoshi cheesecake. The Ramen was amazing, considering it was all vegan. I also loved the cheesecake, not too sweet. 
The service was excellent. The wait staff are so pleasant and kind."}
{"text":"Delighted to have discovered this place!  I tried the avocado salad, ramen and sushi pizza and was impressed with all 3.  The ramen wasn't overly salty which was great.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  I really like the ramen here.  It's delicious.  They also have a variety of foods including tempura and teriyaki and some interesting rolls.

The sushi pizza is great and worth a try.  The pizza base is great.  Really crispy and not too thick.  The topping choices include vegetarian, salmon or tuna.

They also make a great vegetarian dragon roll ~ and it's delish!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for ramen this evening and very few places are open after 10pm. It was surprising to step into such an inviting space as the outside isn't the most alluring. The staff here seem authentically Japanese so I was quite stoked as I sat down. Could this be the hidden Japanese gem on Danforth?

I must admit I was pleasantly distracted by the Olympics on the TV; something about beach volleyball and beautiful ladies :P

Anyhow, this is equivalent to Japanese homey fast food. Their menu is quite large and mostly focused on cooked items; ramen, curry, tempura, rice dishes...etc. There's tremendous value here with quite a number of affordable combos for under $15 to get you full. Since, I was craving ramen, ramen with chicken karage it is. The broth was mediocre but not necessarily bad. The noodles have the right consistency but lacked the freshness of the handmade stuff (that distinctive chew!). The chicken karage was quite miserable; bland, batter is a bit hard and chicken was tender but void of any juices.

I wouldn't hesitate to come back and give them another try. I do like the casual yet warm atmosphere but above all I love the value! If you're looking for a quick and affordable Japanese fix of homey items then this is your calling."}
{"text":"We came in last minute on a Wednesday to get our ramen noodle fix on , we had a very cranky baby 

We were on edge hoping we wouldn't  Disturb any of the other patrons 

The waitress was ever so sweet with her Japanese accent and accommodating towards our child 

 food was great and the ice team
Was awesome"}
{"text":"I think I cannot find a better place for ramen in the East York area for its reasonable price and good quality ramen.  The restaurant is very spacious and clean with tidy and simple interior decoration.  There's always only one female server during day time, but her service is always friendly. 

The BBQ pork is made thicker than other ramen place and the portion is generous.  Meat is very tender.  There are various types of soup base and different combo to choose from.  I like that the soup  base is never too salty but not bland.

However, the waiting time for food is a bit long and sometimes longer than expected even though the lunch hour is never full.  Other than this, I love to come here whenever I am craving for a bowl of ramen on my work days:)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!

Tonkotsu ramen is awesome! The bamboo is chewy and sweet, and the meat is juicy and tender. The pork bone broth is delicious. A popular dish here.

Shio ramen wasn't was good. Very garlicky. I didn't like it very much. 

Chicken karaage - crispy and nicely seasoned.

Tofu cheese cake - very smooth and creamy. My first tofu cheesecake. I didn't really like the flavour, but if I judged this on the texture, it would be a 5!

The dishes are reasonably priced! Accepts credit card.

Only complaint: Drinks and food took awhile to come. 

It was pretty packed a Monday night. Take out is available.

If you check in on Yelp, you get 10% off on any ramen dish!"}
{"text":"Well, they advertise themselves as an Izakaya and ramen place so we tried deep fried Saba and karaage ramen. The Saba was good, nice and fishy. The karaage pieces were small and more crunchy than crispy. The ramen was almost indistinguishable from packaged ramen, although not as salty. It lacked depth of flavor and umami."}
{"text":"Amazing food with exceptional service!!! Their Tonkotsu ramen is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try since it was in my neighbourhood and I wouldn't have to go far. Came here for a late lunch on a Friday - there was a few tables, but nothing crazy.

We had ordered:

- Spicy Miso Ramen
- Salt Broth Ramen

They were ok - can't say there were great and can't say it was terrible. The noodles had a nice texture to it, a bit chewy and not too soft. But the broth was a bit bland - definitely lacking some depth to it like another reviewer had said.

Looking at the menu, they definitely did have quite a few ramen options - perhaps too many options and they should try to narrow it down to make them better.

Perhaps next time we should try the other menu items and not the ramen."}
{"text":"I went there with my family today to see if real ramen was any better than instant ramen and now I can happily say it's at least 1000 times better! It was incredible the noodles much more flavourful and the pork cooked was to have the perfect texture and it all just blended together perfectly! I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to be making this update. I've gone a few times since my initial review and I feel like each time the quality and taste of the ramen declined heavily. 

The broth is no longer rich and delicious, instead it's just salty and tastes like it came from a powder pack.

The meat is tough. The toppings have gone down the toilet. The quality over all is just..... Bad.

The eggs are still perfectly cooked... But I can make eggs at home instead of fishing them out of sub par ramen."}
{"text":"I think there might be a problem with consistency. I had an absolutely inedible meal there (tempura don), and one of my favourite bloggers also hated it. But some people I respect claim to have had delicious ramen there. 

I will probably not go back, but I hope my meal was an exception rather than the rule."}
{"text":"Clean, cute, friendly space. Had no idea it served ramen there until recently as I thought it was just another sushi joint, which are pretty plentiful in this city. It's great to have a place you can get ramen at and not have to go downtown and wait in a huge line to get it. I like ramen, but to wait in line for it? Crazy.

I had the miso ramen and the broth was delicious. I preferred it over the soy broth. They even provide little wooden spoons to eat it with. Also, they were playing Japanese pop music when I was there, which I appreciated and made the experience more authentic. The last thing I want to hear in a Japanese restaurant is Justin Bieber. Ya know?

I can't speak about their sushi, but I will be back for ramen. They also do it as takeout which I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Korean/Chinese-run so-called 'Japanese' restaurants are as hip as a Porsche SUV and as useful as a crucifix hanging from the rear view mirror of a car. These are things that only those who don't know any better and have no clue entertain.
Here the owner and chef is Chinese, but he has spent time in Japan and even speaks some Japanese.

That is why it was a surprise that the food followed actual Japanese recipe and was not watered down or Canadianized or served with hot sauce like Korean food like they do at Kushi. The items were actually prepared with care, marinated in advance correctly and did not try to innovate or to be creative. Great... No short cuts here!

Truth be told their main items are sushi and ramen and my friends and I had tempura, nabeyaki udon and katsudon and they were both great, but I cannot write about their main features. There are so many terrible and fake sushi and ramen restaurants in town that probably whatever Nakayoshi serves is better than the average.
Nabeyaki udon was rich, the noodles were tasty and the broth was flavourful. Certainly the chicken was marinated in advance and the vegetables were mushrooms were exactly the Japanese way.
The katsudon was tasty too and perfectly Japanese. The cut of meat and batter was perfect. This was like eating it in Japan.
Tempura came with a crisp and fresh batter and was not thick or oily.
The beer was cheap.
To be precise Nakayoshi has a couple of fake Japanese or trendy items like teriyaki this and teriyaki that including teriyaki poutine.

They have a wide menu, which is why they call themselves an izakaya, and there are some items only in Japanese on the wall (the embarrassing 'dumpings' is on the menu... eeewwww). They have a wide range of drinks and appetizers.
The restaurant was mostly empty, which we appreciated (I am sure unlike the owner). There is a good Japanese-style decoration and attempt at atmosphere and to their credit play Japanese music on the PA. Unfortunately, they have two TVs which are on CP24, which is not my idea of a classy restaurant or izakaya or Japanese restaurant. Still, the TVs are far and one could instead focus on the nice Japanese dolls in the cases on the wall.
The sole Japanese waitress was very friendly (or nakayoshi) and efficient. She did make a mistake in our order and quickly tried to rectify it and make up for it. She was very service-oriented.
The restaurant is very clean. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I am not impressed. I ordered a spicy salmon and spicy tuna hand roll as well as dynamite rolls to go and was provided with the wrong total twice. 

I was over charged, quality of the sushi was mediocre and the quantity was subpar. 

I am including an image of my order so everyone sees how much sushi $20+ gets you here."}
{"text":"Good for the family to have an early dinner. Nice assortment of ramen and their sushi is well made. Friendly staff. 

Great place for a casual dinner"}
{"text":"Our server was beyond adorable. Very attentive and sweet. The decor is nice and clean. The food came quickly and the portions were decently sized. I ordered the dinner special of the evening: gyoza (4), sushi of the day (tuna, salmon, shrimp), teriyaki beef, ebi-shrimp served with rice, salad and soup. Came with ice-cream, I chose ginger. It was a nice spread. Many more dinner options than most a la carte restaurants (especially in the area). Extensive ramen options. I will come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking up what to have around this area, came upon this place.  I'm actually quite surprise by the great rating here.  First off i have to say the service is great, she was very patient with us, since we just kept chatting away once we sat down.  We ordered a few items to share.  The grilled squid isn't overcooked, the flavour wasn't overpowering, we did enjoy this dish very much.  Tonkotsu Ramen, the booth was tasteless, we kept putting the ramen seasoning spices in there.  The noodle itself was overcooked.  Sushi, takoyaki are okay, not the best i had. Soft shell crab, not much of a seasoning, and it wasn't crunchy enough.  We finished off with the mochi ice cream, got vanilla and green tea, green tea mochi is abit on the sweeter side."}
{"text":"I popped in here for a quick lunch and I really enjoyed it. The place was clean and comfortable and the service was good. I had the fried chicken ramen and it was very tasty. I would not hesitate to return to try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"THEY DELIVER RAMEN!!! And they do it properly too! The broth arrived steaming hot in its own container, the noodles with the veggies / egg / meat in another, and if you order the Karaage ramen - the Kara-age comes on its own in a Styrofoam container with a noticeable hole poked in it so that the hot steam can escape from the container, preserving the crispiness of the Kara-age.

I had the Tonkotsu and Kara-age ramen and they give you about four pieces of protein for each and they provide a generous portion of noodles. Their noodles are a bit chewier than the rest of the ramen places I've been to (not that it's a bad thing). They provide lots of broth, seasoned well and not overly salty. Overall, I loved the Tonkotsu and the Kara-age was delicious as well. Will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get ramen in the area. They do a veggie miso broth with boiled egg and veggies that's really delicious."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but really not as good as I was expecting. They do have actual Japanese food on the menu (not just what we Canadians know, like teriyaki and sushi), but, while their gyudon was good - it did not taste Japanese at all! I could have easily mistake it for a text mex fajita dish or something. I honestly don't remember the rest of the stuff that we ordered, but overall neither my wife and I were particularly impressed. Still, I would eat here again if I had a good reason too, it just wasn't the Japanese experience I was hoping for. Also, when you see the word \"Izakaya\" you (I, at least) usually think loud and busy crowd. That was not the case here at all.

Oh and another plus - the staff were extremely accommodating in terms of making substitutions."}
{"text":"Nakayoshi Izakaya has a good set up and really roomy. Maybe because there were only 2 tables including us on a Saturday prime dinner hour.

We shared an order of Udon ($12) and a Sushi Platter ($23). The udon was well cooked with just the right bite. Love the fish selection for our Sushi Platter but the nigiri has too much rice and packed too loosely. So they just fell apart when I tried to dip them in the soy sauce.

Service was attentive and friendly. 

Not a bad choice if you have craving for Japanese food when you in the area. Especially after having a few beers at The Only Cafe!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for good ramen where I know I won't have to wait in line to squeeze into a small table.  It's roomy and service is attentive and prompt, making it kid-friendly.  The food is great too of course!  The tonkatsu ramen is a must try.  Also really like their dragon roll."}
{"text":"Delicious, jaw dropping ramen! Good service, nice room.

Took a friend from Rochester here and it was a blast. They have a great selection of sochu and sake, and offered more traditional Japanese goodies than you'd find in most sushi restaurants in town. We each got a ramen; her the spicy miso and me the pork tonkatsu. The broth was creamy and slightly smokey, the pork slices were moist and fell apart at the slightest touch: It was the best ramen I'd ever had, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to Greek Town for Greek, ended up eating Japanese. How does that even happen? The old, \"I'm hungry, spin around and point at the nearest restaurant\" game.

I'm pleasantly surprised to find this little gem.

We were the only people in there which made me a little nervous and skeptical but I suppose a 4 o'clock dinner is a little early. My skepticism was taken away with the food.

I love ramen and Tonkotsu is my go to. It was brilliant here. From the presentation to the flavor, it stood up well to any specialized ramen restaurants I've been to, and I've been to lots.

The katsu (a Japanese schnitzel) curry rice was pretty bomb too.

Service was very accommodating and decor was very interesting and quaint. If you sit in the booths, the figurines and ornamentation on the wall and shelves are a great conversation topic."}
