{"text":"I LOVE pizza but this place is straight garbage. The employees are nice but the pizza tastes DISGUSTING. When you walk in, the pizza on display (the one they put in the oven for you) looks like it's been sitting there for 3 days. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! I got 2 slices of pizza and a drink and it came out to $18 and some change. I forced my self to finish the first slice which was burnt and had a funky taste but as for the second slice I tried to force it down but made it only half way ... I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife was craving pizza and we decided to try this place out since it was across from the Wynn. Pizza was great. Thin crust, pepperoni was oh so crispy, huuuuge slices. Did not disappoint. We also had some of the wicked softserve which was a dream in a cone. Great location in front of fashion show mall. Will visit next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I worked in the pizza industry for 13 years so this is close to my heart...uh stomach? The pizza here is truly well made.  The sauce is the best I have had, period.  The crust is perfect and the toppings are super high-quality and plentiful (finally! a pizza place that puts enough on!)  I tried the wings as well and they were superb, crispy, juicy, big, yum!  Service was super friendly and quick too.  This place should be a destination for you, not just if you pass by."}
{"text":"Lynn assisted me during my first visit. Pizza was fantastic and she even let me try to Nutella soft serve! Great food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza shops. Had the carnivore slice and it was amazing! The inside is very clean and service was fast. Thank you Luis and Daisy"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Stumbled across this gem a week after they opened. Pizza was some of the best I've ever had. One slice is an entire meal. Superb customer service. Will be back. Don't pass this one up!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place 11/25. Decided to order the Jurassic Slice. A lady by the name of Valerie helped me who was very knowledgeable of each pizza and helped me decide on a slice that would best fill my appetite. Her service was also very quick even was engaging in questions on how my day was going and if I had gone Black Friday shopping made me feel welcomed....If you're looking for a great dessert I highly recommend the Nutella soft serve came in a waffle cone with coffee cotton candy around it! Very good. All in all great service, great food, great location!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza.  We split a slice of the Jurassic meats and  we're both very impressed.  A slice is $6 which seems high but you get a massive piece of pizza. We will def be back !"}
{"text":"Checked this place out this afternoon.  Huge slices of pizza with great ingredients and creative combinations. Very good all around.  Prices are excellent considering the great location!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service! This place has vegetarian options which I love. The Roasted Cauliflower & VEGGIE sausage pizza was legit! Not only that we got lucky and got some free ice cream with our pizzas. Good vibes and Good pizza to get your pizza fix."}
{"text":"We were passing by and decided to check the place out. It did not disappoint.  Not only the pizzas are very good but the staff is very friendly. We met Joe the chef there and he told us all about the place, even offered us some samples of the beer and their delicious Wicked soft serve. It's something that combines taste with art. I w cream is served on a cone topped with a plate that holds an espresso infused cotton candy. Sounds crazy right? Well, you'll have to see it to get it. I forgot my phone that day but I'm sure you will find it posted. Look it up! Now back to the pizzas: you won't find the traditional topping; God knows everyone has those. This place offers pizza toppings that seem to come from actual dishes, whether the roasted garlic, chick peas or cauliflower. You feel like you are eating straight from a pasta dish and somehow it still seem to compliment a slice of pizza without seeming to be too much. The crust is very good and the sizes are larger than your average size. The decor is beautiful; most of it imported straight from Italy like the counter marble tops while still having a sort of an industrial look. Very nice especially for a tiny place on the strip. Check it out and make sure you ask for Joe; he would be happy to tell you all about it..."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza - huge slices for $5.00 filled with toppings!! Owner is very nice! Definitely recommend to anyone in Vegas lookin for pizza!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that Wicked Slice is one of the BEST pizza places on the Las Vegas Strip. They have monstrous servings and they are very affordable! 

Wicked Slice is located at the Fashion Show Mall, right across the street from the Wynn hotel. Great note for all Fashion Show employees: 10% DISCOUNT! They have an awesome user friendly app too, so you can order and pay ahead of time if you're short on time. 

Their dough is hands down what makes their pizza so great. It's chewy and crusted with a generous amount of cheese. It's New York style pizza (the best kind) so it gets pretty messy. Their pizza menu has a great veggie pizza that has roasted cauliflower and mushrooms--A MUST TRY. They also have a pizza called Jurassic Meats, which is essentially a meat lovers dream! Wicked Slice also offers wings, sub sandwiches and salads. 

If you're ever shopping at Fashion Show and need a break, take your stop at Wicked Slice, YOU WONT REGRET IT."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They just opened in fashion show mall. The wings are so flavorful and the pizza is perfect. The staff is so pleasant and friendly. Makes you feel like you are home !! Shout out to Zach and his crew."}
{"text":"This place was a real surprise! Tried it on a whim while staying in Vegas. Really delicious affordable pizza, right across from the Wynn Casino. They are in the Fashion Show area of Vegas. If you have a late night pizza craving they don't disappoint. With pies such as Jurassic Meats, Triple Pepperoni and Six cheese. They have something anyone can enjoy. The workers Valerie and Kim are very nice and helpful.  Did I mention affordable? You get amazing quality and portions for not a lot of dough.  Getting a slice The Wicked Slice is doing Vegas right."}
{"text":"great pizza!  i had the jurassic meats slice, and it was amazing.  great food, great prices, and great service!  Ask for Valerie, she is super friendly and helpful!  and the pizza slices are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was original and delicious. We tried a new dessert...Nutella flavored soft serve with coffee flavored cotton candy was to die for!"}
{"text":"I knew when I bit into my slide that this was no ordinary pizza joint. I was transported back to NYC where the slices are gratuitously huge and flop over with the weight of hot cheesy saucy goodness due to the super thin crust. The ratio to sauce and cheese was perfect too. We got the pepperoni pizza because you can never go wrong with pepperoni let alone 3 types of pepperoni. They even sprinkle the crust with freshly grated Parmesan. The owner was super personable and offered us their ice cream which was a reason to come to this place on its own. Great location! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, the best affordable meal I had in Las Vegas. The pizza slices are huge and one was definitely enough for me. I really enjoyed the Jurassic Meats and Roman White Pizza as well as the garlic knots. I will definitely come back again. The cashier/waiter was also extremely nice and polite. He gave us the free nutella ice cream dessert. It was soooo unique and delicious even though it was a little sweet. Amazing food, vibe, affordable, and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I don't get it but I wish I did. This place is just okay. The pizza slices are huge but the pizza itself is probably slightly below average. The toppings sound interesting, but the execution is poor. I got the Roma White or something like that and the chicken cutlet on it tastes like it had been deep fried 2-3x, so that there was no chicken left on the inside, just an overly greasy shell of bread crumbs. Very strange. 

The garlic on the pizza was good though.... and the employees are nice. That's about it. So yeah, convenient and pricing per slice is decent if you happen to be walking by, but definitely not somewhere I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"A small place on the strip with great pizza and great sides. Owner is very friendly and provides great service! Intimate place which makes it great for couples, definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! my Thursday night was wonderful with a great meal what a change of workers and attitude. They had all type of pizzas on the display, i was help by a young gentleman i ask questions about every pizza, i thought he will get annoyed by me since i am very picky on what i eat but not once this worker gave me bad gesture or a bad attitude. He kept his cool answer all my question very professional, i believe he must of been the cook since he knew all the answer to my questions  he stop making a pizza and help me out. I was happy with my meal delicious jurassic meats pizza and good beer. I love this place thank you cook LOUIS and thank you to the cashier which i apologize for not asking for your name but u guys were wonderful. KEEP UP THE WONDERFUL WORK AND WHAT A GREAT PIZZA JOINT love this guys thanks again."}
{"text":"Plenty of great pizza!!! The Jurassic pizza is delicious, And the roman white with crispy chicken!!! Oh I could eat here every day. But the dessert is chocolate ice cream with expresso cotton candy!!!!! Oh this place is off the charts with amazing food. 5 stars and the service is very personable and the staff takes great care of you."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  The garlic knots are overrated. 
Stick to the pizza and you can't go wrong!  They've only been open for a couple of days. Once they get the kinks sorted out, it'll be a fined tuned express pizza option. Great value/quality for food on the strip!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great. They didn't have pepperoni and they did offer to make one, so we got it fresh out of the oven. The other slices looked like they had been sitting there for a while. Coke products- YaY!
At one point the girl working there stood on the stainless counter where they do food preparation to stock that area with Pizza boxes. I am going to assume they cleaned and sanitized that area after (although not while we were sitting there eating), but it gives a really disgusting presentation to customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza & knots. Friendly staff. Clean & organized. They even have beer coming soon!  Highly recommend when you are walking around the strip!"}
{"text":"lol I'm not sure why on yelp it says it's closed but they have the best pizza for your buck. The slices are HUGE. The garlic knots are bomb and the Nutella desert was amazing as well! Must try this place out."}
{"text":"The cotton candy is dope so are the workers. Come on in if you want some awesome fun while eating great pizza.  WOOO"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but Valerie is WiCKed!!!! lol  .. Great Location, Great view (literally)."}
{"text":"Came to the mall for some Xmas shopping and stumbled upon this gem!!!! So good fresh ingredients and fresh dough!! The ranch is delish.  They offer wings, salads, subs and even cold beer on tap!! Luis was awesomesuper helpful . Cute indoor and outdoor seating over looking the strip.  This is totally gonna be my go to place for great pizza!"}
{"text":"Well all I wanted was a quick slice of pizza and what I found was an awesome pizza experience! The pizza pies were actually \"pretty\" -I notice details and I like how they sprinkle pretty cheese on the crust. I know sounds silly but it's the truth. The staff was very friendly and personable. I felt like I was home and not just a tourist. 

Now for the simple slice of pizza, OMG it was delicious. Much more flavorful than I expected and it was not \"just a slice of pizza\". I'm not a regular pizza person but I recognize great tastes and this was on the mark!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Service and food were wonderful. Lyn explained everything to me. From the Pepperoni Pizza, the Wall Street Pizza to their Salads and Wings. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Pizza and it was delicious. I love roasted cauliflower! I also had the Garlic Knots and Wings. OMG they were both amazing! The Garlic Knots had enough garlic and salt on them that it made me want to drink it down with a beer. So, I ordered a PBR... Lyn asked me how spicy I wanted the wings. I got it very spicy. Many places who serve Hot wings say they're hot when they're normally not. Wicked Slice wings are extra spicy. They use the Carolina Reaper pepper, which is the hottest pepper in the world. I must say, the wings were hot. They were so good!!!! I wanna go back and order more."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a diamond in the rough!! Such a great crew, amazing food at an outstanding price. As well, the location couldn't be better!"}
{"text":"Awesome slice of pizza right on the strip. Super nice staff. Don't be scared to try the soft serve as well."}
{"text":"I came into Wicked Slice today and was greeted by two very friendly people, Luis and Lyn. They made my experience a very positive one and I will definitely be coming back. Not only for the food, but for the amazing service I received!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a bite. Delicious pizzas and desserts. Friendly staff, will come again"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing people!! The manager Ramone was so good to us and made our experience wonderful! I work at The Fashion Show Mall and this is everyone's favorite place to eat !!! Love love love !! The garlic knots are to die for !"}
{"text":"Food here is great! But with the setup and having to be so close to the bigger manager guy being a complete dick to all his staff a foot away from you waiting for the food watching the faces of everyone in there being so taken back by his behaviour is ridiculous. Witnessed this twice today"}
{"text":"The Nutella soft serve in the espresso cotton candy wrapped cone is the most amazing dessert I've had in years. It's a must try dessert!!"}
{"text":"Wicked pizza was awesome huge slices and good price very filling. Nutella dessert with espresso cotton candy was very good. Now on to the matter at hand that Valerie is one nice piece of aceeee. Real talk Valerie is awesome very sexy and my brother is really digging her and I can see way... his name is Randy"}
{"text":"This spot is located across the street from the Wynn hotel in front of the fashion show mall, next to Benihana and Kona Grill. This is nice place where you can get pizza by the slice or pie. The six cheese pizza was big and pretty filling. A bit greasy but no more so then other places. They have other options including dessert and chicken wings. Reasonably priced for its location and the food is pretty decent. A good place to go for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This spot is my new favorite pizza place in town!! Good price for what it is, super good flavors plus the slices are big. Lynn and Luis are super nice and accommodating too!

Also, try their Nutella soft serve with coffee cotton candy on top. It was a new dessert experience for us. 5 stars all in all! Love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Good pie! Great staff! A little expensive for a slice and a drink, but it's the Strip. Go here. Order food. People watch. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I had the greatest, greasiest service from the phenomenal Ms. Valerie. Fast and delicious pizza made satisfied my stomach in ways I didn't think were possible. All in all it was a pretty good pizza- would eat again. I got lost in the nothingness that is my significance compared to this phenomenal pizza. The lone fact that I was able to partake in the decadence of this sensational meal keeps me going in this cruel world. There aren't words to describe the magnificent seconds I spent in this wicked paradise."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! The pizza is as big as your arm! The employees here are really high energy and really courteous and friendly. The manager, however, hovers over the shoulders of his employees being incredibly rude and absolutely degrading. and because of the way the place is set up, they make the food right in front of you. And you're just awkwardly standing there while he insults his team, being so mean!! Other than that, the only thing on the menu I didn't have was the subs and I'm assuming they're delectable by the looks of them! Definitely suggest the white roman pizza."}
