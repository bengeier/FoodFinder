{"text":"We heard about Hardy's from my dad, who raved about their burgers and great prices.  He did not lead us astray.   Two weeks ago, my husband ordered the Holy Redeemer (burger) and loved it. I listened to my conscience and had a grilled chicken salad, which included generous portions of chicken and olives. The seasoning on the chicken was different, but very good. The dressing was excellent. Bonus: they have a great app for ordering.   Fast forward to a week later, and we were looking for a local spot to cater a small family get together. Hardy's was perfect. We met with Kelly and Drew to select our menu only three days earlier. Ultimately, we chose a platter of Grovewood sandwiches, which feature tender roast beef on toasted sandwich rolls, saut√©ed onions, and a side of au jous for an appetizer.  They were a huge hit and disappeared quickly.  For dinner, we chose a pan of chicken parmesan, which came with a of ziti. Everything was cooked to perfection, and the sauce made the meal.  Kelly delivered our order to us on time as well, and as expected.   All in all, we were all very pleased with the food, the quality, the price, and the service. We would certainly call Hardy's in the future for takeout, or catering.   Foot note: these are very nice people who strive to make their customers happy, and it shows."}
