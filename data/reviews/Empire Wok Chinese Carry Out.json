{"text":"This is the worst Chinese-American 'food' that I have had in a long time.  Since I'd never had their food before, I went with a safe dish: General Tso's chicken.  It was wholly inedible.  The chicken was chewy, and the sauce that came with it seemed to be a mixture of corn syrup and soy sauce.  I don't recall if there was garlic or ginger in it.  All I remember is how horrible the food was.  And it was.  I'm losing my appetite just by recalling my experience.  *shudder*"}
{"text":"The food is always on point and fresh out the pan when you pick it up. This guy works his ass off to provide fresh, tasty food. Much respect."}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout in the Berea Strongsville area. Food is always good. Prices aren't bad. And the portions are huge. The owner is always nice and friendly when you pick up your food. Food is always done really fast too! A must try for anyone who likes Chinese."}
{"text":"I have not eaten Empire Wok's food in a long time and it will be a long time coming. They must have changed hands and not for the better.   Mexican flour tacos instead of traditional mu shu pork pancakes. I suspect frozen or definitely store bought pre-prepared chicken for the sweet and sour chicken. A meal that my 11 year old grand daughter rejected. Ordered a small fried rice got a large. $32 meal. All in All not a great experience and not one to repeat. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice hard working guy making good take-out food.  He does the Americanized-Chinese food standards well."}
{"text":"I agree with Kristen W. The one guy who runs this place is amazing. He is very personable, hard working, and an excellent Chinese Chef. I love looking at the recent pictures of his family, and fun little reminders of them he brings to work (Kid-made Christmas Gingerbread Houses....etc.)  We've ordered from this place many times and never been disappointed. One word of caution - if it's marked \"hot\" on the menu (in red, with an asterisk) and you don't like REALLY HOT food, you better ask for mild or no heat. My kids love the fried rice and won ton soup, I love the Curry Chicken (MILD, PLEASE!), Twice Cooked Pork, and Hong Sui Tofu, and my husband is fond of the Mongolian Chicken - although he says it's prepared a bit differently than he gets other places. Yes, if you order something with breading, there will be LOT of it. Last week we ordered the Poo Poo platter, and those shrimp were surrounded by a heavenly pillow of fried, battered goodness! This was the first time my 4 year old tried Beef Sticks and it is one of her new favorites. I just noticed that the latest menu includes something different, that I've not seen on other Chinese take-out menus (Homemade Mustard). I believe we'll try that the next time we order.  The prices for the Value Dinners, Extra Family Specials, and Family Dinner are really good prices for the amount of food. Great for get-togethers!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good with a constant stream of customers.  General RSP chicken and lomein are wonderful.  Also try peer beef, best we've had in years"}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout around! You wouldn't think that fried rice could be anything special... until you try it here. For those who love shrimp chips as much as I do, they are made fresh to order. The owner is amazing. Works hard and recognized me, by name, after being in only two times."}
{"text":"It's time somebody shows the most hardworking Chinese cook some love! One man runs this shop and churns out fresh hot food in less that 25 minutes on average.   We have been coming to him since we moved near here almost 15 years ago. You have to know what to expect because his food may be different than you would Expect. For example most popular chicken dishes are fried with a thick breading if that is your thing. I much prefer fresher things on the menu. The portions are large and the lunch specials are a great deal. My favorite things to get from here is the pork lo mien (seriously the best I have ever had!), fried rice, wonton soup, and spring rolls. The pork lo mien is a go to when we can't decide on dinner! Such a friendly hardworking man churning out tons of Chinese food, give him some love!"}
{"text":"The owner was so kind and even provided plates for us, wonderful general Taos and yummy rice"}
{"text":"Hmmm I hate when people just rip on a chefs work from ordering only one thing... Plus lady all u ordered was the Chinese version of chicken nuggets if u want nuggets go to mc Donald's..... I orderd a good variety of food things that I use to judge the quality of the restaurant and things I can make myself but am to lazy to do....  The Singapore mei fun the spring roll and wonton soup was good the shrimp and lobster sauce was more soup then sauce needs work.... Also didn't help u got my egg rolls turned into spring rolls luckily they were good..... If your mad at Chinese American food be mad at America because Chinese food was perfect the way it was...... That's why I stay Going to Chinatown downtown almost any resturant past e30th between st Clair and Payne.... Enjoy"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Chinese, love the the generals tso and fried rice. Been going here for years. Hardest working owner, amazing watching him cook the food."}
