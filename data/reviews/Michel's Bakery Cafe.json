{"text":"Surprised at the value considering I'm in an upscale mall. Had a great blueberry Danish on a previous review recommendation. Also a German chocolate cake coffee. Better fare than Tims any day! Nice place to crash while wife hunts down sales."}
{"text":"Fresh bread and croissant makes everything so tasty.
Great place to eat for lunch or snack especially after long hours of shopping"}
{"text":"What better place to have breakfast than here. The almond croissants are one of my favourites. The broccoli and cheese danish are impossible to miss. Get it warmed up, absolutely perfection. The staff is always perfectly friendly, and the environment is suitable for practically type of sit down breakfast. I've been there with my mother, boyfriend, family, friends, but it's still on the nicer scale with a good amount of class."}
{"text":"Ordered a panini, soup and quiche.  The cajun chicken panini was okay, not a lot of chicken in the panini for me.  The clam chowder soup were very good if you like oceany soups (tastes briny I want to say, or how certain fish taste fishy), the quiche was okay, nothing special.  Those 3 items plus a small chocolate milk set us back $21.  Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch with mom and was sorely disappointed by the service and only later slightly consoled by the cajun sandwich. The lady we solicited help for deciding our menu was inexplicably grumpy and seemed to lash out at our questions which were fairly reasonable (i.e. which are the gourmet soups among the regular soups?) The beet salad we ordered with the sandwich was far from fresh and the gourmet thai chicken soup was salty and the regular soup so-so. Not the place you want to grab a meal with a friend (or even by yourself if you care about customer service) but the breads and coffee I wouldn't mind having to go.
Honest review written after I finished the meal."}
{"text":"I love everything. There's a lot of vegetarian options. The bread is perfect. This is my new bakery. I love this place so much. I live near there. I just want something different."}
{"text":"Killer sandwiches and pastries. When I first tried their chocolate crescent, I fell in love with it instantly. It was so fresh, so soft and the chocolate was not overly sweet, dusted with powdered sugar, it's to die for when you have a sweet craving! Not to mention how much I love the variety of specialty sandwiches and deli sandwiches that they have. One thing that could be better in my opinion is definitely the pricing. I feel that the sandwiches and certain pastries are overpriced. For example, a simple tuna salad or chicken salad sandwich is about $7.99 (that's the price of an entire combo for food elsewhere)."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place even before the renovation.  

The blueberry cheese danish is my favourite item...flaky pastry with a ring of cheese surrounds the blueberry centre.   My mouth waters every time I'm near this place.  

For a breakfast treat, I love the broccoli cheese danish...

Michel's Baguette is irresistible."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the ONLY way to do chocolate croissants. The spinach and feta is good too but my fav is chocolate. The food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Got a bacon croissantwich that had one piece of bacon for $4.90. What a rip off. The seating is fine at this time of the day but given the price point i am very disappointed. The staff are inattentive and disirganized even with the assembly line stlye."}
{"text":"Come here often for breakfast on Saturdays. Usually easy to get a seat or do take out! Their freshly baked goods are the bomb!!! And lots of selection too. Also, the Italian wedding soup is top notch!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite bakery because of how incredible their sandwiches are. Not everything in this place is incredible, but it still gets 5 stars from me because of how amazing certain items are. The best part, is that the quality hasn't changed in over 20 years. Whenever I come to Yorkdale I have to order the tuna sandwich on a sesame seed baguette. The quality of the ingredients and skill cooking/baking the food really comes through. I often pair it with minestrone soup, and lately I've been having cream of broccoli, and a coffee. The double chocolate croissant is amazing. I recently tried one of their newer croissant flavours, I think hazelnut? Wasn't good. But the cheese danishes are, as are the non-sweet croissants. The location at Vaughan Mills doesn't compare. Don't even bother going to that one. The one at Fairview isn't as good either. This location is doing something right. They renovated about a year ago and added more seating, which really helps, because it gets packed sometimes. This is the best part of Yorkdale for me!"}
{"text":"Small brunette cashier is so impatient and rude. Other than that, location is packed with few available seats and decently clean. Food old taste better if I haven't lost my appetite from that rude cashier."}
{"text":"I find that this Michels doesn't taste as yummy as fairview mall. Fairview mall location has more selection with desirable options. Most of the pastries in Yorkdale Michels are hot dog or raisin lol. 

Fairview offers a lot more and their pastries are made bigger. 

It is a hefty price for mall food, but I guess its a better choice compatibly to the food court"}
{"text":"I've walked passed Michel's bakery right in the morning and I can smell the fresh pastries being pulled from the oven. I got the almond croissant for a friend but I had a piece and it was good. I liked how the almond butter wasn't too sweet and that the almond croissant was still super fluffy."}
{"text":"Cute bakery for when you are at Yorkdale Mall. Cool selection of puff pastry savory and  sweet."}
{"text":"I just love this place! The soups I have had are flavorful (Tomato bisque reminds me of back home!) I like the feel of the whole place and the staff are always friendly to me. I recommend the grilled Cajun panini- it's superb!"}
{"text":"Not bad, just nothing special.

Michel's Bakery Cafe is inside Yorkdale Mall. There's a lengthy wait, especially on the weekend and if you want to get a seat. Instead, I just had some pastries to go. The lineup is about 5-10 minutes, at 4pm in the afternoon.

They offer bagels, croissants, buns, Danishes and other pastries. I tried one specialty chocolate croissant and another cheese and jam Danish. Total added up to $7.35 including tax. They tasted meh, maybe even a bit dry. It wasn't bad, but just nothing special. It tastes the same as the pastries at the grocery store. 

They have a good display and presentation. But I feel like this place was more hype - you are only interested because you see a long line and big crowd."}
{"text":"Tried this place multiple times. Service is horrible, the employees are complaining about working while helping you and are super impatient. The food is overpriced and I would recommend going somewhere else!"}
{"text":"the bread is ok, lacks flavor, salt, something....but the chocolate almond croissants are to die for...lite lunche fare , salads, sandwiches but overall always a good experience...."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bakery with my family and myself for the last 15 years or so, and I swear, the chocolate almond croissants never fail to disappoint! Each pastry is flaky, crumble, crispy, sweet, and salty all in one and is a definite pit stop every time I go to Yorkdale.

Personal favourite is the spinach and feta pastry :)"}
{"text":"A great place to have a quick breakfast. Very casual. Loved the French-Italian combination of food here! The bakery is packed with tasty and sweets goodies.  The sandwich selection is very impressive."}
{"text":"There's nothing I enjoy more in this world then a freshly baked light and fluffy piece of bread! Most people do not understand my appreciation for bread, but I kidd you not, when they made the phrase, \"Man can't live on bread alone\" they clearly did not sample the whole population! 

I went here last weekend for lunch.  Yorkdale is a pretty busy mall, and Michel's is no exception.  There's two counters, one where you can go buy breads and other goodies from behind the counter, and then there's the line where you can buy food such as soups, sandwiches and desserts.   For first timers like myself, it's all sorta confusing because the two lines intersect each other.  I tried their onion and cheese bun, which was a good size and absolutely delish!  

They do have a pretty good size seating area so you can sit and eat. It's like a food court, only they have people to clear the tables. If you are lucky to find one that is clean during busy hours, then grab it.  Otherwise you'll have to wait until someone comes to pick up the trays and plates.  There is no designated place to put your used plates even if you wanted to clear your table for the next person.

{"text":"I was blown away by how GOOD this place is. I'm not a fan of bread/bagels/baguettes.. anything like that really. But my friend and I stopped by and when I tried his fanzette with cheese (basically a gourmet croissant with a sausage and cheese- looks like a westernized 'cheun jai bao' for all my cantonese folks)

The pastries and baguettes look super fresh and they are not understaffed at all. So many people working hard in an assembly line and customer service was great. The pastries are also very unique and they have stuff like a pizza croissant. They also had a staff giving out free smoothie and baguette/cinnamon bun samples- THE MANGO SMOOTHIE BLEW MY MIND. Also, very fresh samples because when I came back a second time ten min later to get my own cheese stick (my friend's fanzette taste lingered in my mouth and begged me to come back for more. That tease.), anyway- new samples were out. Yum! Only downfall is that it is a bit pricey- his fanzette was around $5... 

Very efficient although there's always a inevitable line here. I'll try the other things next time and maybe sit down as well."}
{"text":"Wow what a good find I always past by this place and never eat here cause the line ups are ridiculously long and it's crazy packed inside for a reason the food is fresh tasting!!! I did a take out and ordered some of the pastries a 6 pack box of any pastry in the front window was $15.75 not bad pricing for high quality patty the cheese croissant and broccoli cheese croissant was my favourite very fresh tasting at 8pm at night. I was very impressed with the quick service and many employees serving it up the line up was month but it did go fast they are fast fast!!! They usually have samples of breads or smoothies on the counter be sure to look out for those or even ask they are more than willing to place some. I had a pleasant experience very impressed with quality and service would be returning again thank you !"}
{"text":"Looks like I forgot to review this place!
We visited Michels at the end of December, during the holidays so you can imagine the line up at Yorkdale to get a seat. We waited for a while but luckily got a place.
There is so much to choose from - sandwiches, soups, baguettes and a huge assortment of delicious pastries. Naturally, I opted for the broccoli and cheese crossaint with a mocha and was extremely satisfied with my selection. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious and price is also quite reasonable - on par with most coffee shops. 
It was a little noisy and cramped as tables were squashed snugly next to each other but I think that's the charm of such places! My husband and I both enjoyed it and queuing up was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I love it at Michel's bakery. A perfect place to meet up with friends if you plan on catching up at brunch. Since it is in the mall you can always go shopping afterwards or even go to the movies. I usually get the chocolate cookies from here. They are loaded with chocolate chips and are the softest cookies I've ever eaten. If you are looking for something to fill you though, I would recommend getting their Cajun chicken panini and always makes sure you get it on the sesame bun. Also the their pizza, they just recently changed their style of pizza so it looks like a personal pizza you order at restaurants. The last thing that I would recommend everyone to get and suggest trying at least once is to get their bagels (plain specifically) with their butter. They are the softest bagels you will ever have in your life. It's like it melts in your mouth as you eat it. 

Pros:
- everyone is very nice when serving you 
- sometime they have deals at the end of the night, usually BOGO 
- great place for brunch and breakfast
- a lot of seating on the interior and exterior of the restaurant 
- large variety of sandwiches and snacks 

Cons:
- sometimes the wait line is ridiculous 
- pretty pricey- the Cajun chicken sandwich alone is about 7-9$"}
{"text":"The cheese and fruit danishes are always awesome, just wish they were fresh or warmed up.

This location is always pretty busy, but the line goes really fast if you're just ordering a drink and a pastry. Good place to get a quick bite to satisfy your sweet-tooth."}
{"text":"For Yorkdale  this is a 4* choice in terms of quality and price.

For all other purposes this is really an average 3.5. Anyways this place is cafeteria style and you can select from a variety of lunching foods from pizzas to salads, sandwiches, wraps and hot specials. It's all good home cooking. 

The bakery is quite good too for pastries and such.  Stop in here if your not down for food court crap and don't want to busy ur wallet on the shitty rainforest cafe."}
{"text":"Last Night! Dessert from a classic place in Yorkdale Mall! Michel's Baguette! I've always had a Love for this Classic Place! I would say its one of my favorite places! 5/5 Everything in there is Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The croissants are on point! Especially the Chocolate Almond and Ham & Cheese! Everything is always fresh!"}
{"text":"There is no reason to be getting your bagels & pastries from anyone else in the mall when there's a Michel's Baguette around. Their bagels & pastries are so light and fresh, you don't feel as if you've just ingested heavy carbs. Service is always great, and their coffee's pretty good too. Also a nice place to sit in the mall, away from the crowds..."}
{"text":"Service great , food great , prices great , can't beat it, I highly recommend it , orange juice was a little small lol but otherwise great"}
{"text":"Taste really bad in general after owner changed. TBH coffee is bad... come on it's coffee. Staffs are not nice and owner is worst. Owner should treat their employees like family and not garbage. I over heard the conversation from the kitchen. It was not pretty. Oh if that was @ my work place. HR right away.
Please improve."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! My favourite baguette location still! Go early, 30 mins before mall the opens to get fresh breads. Love the egg bread, croissants and bagels. Soups and salads are good but can get pricey. A bagel or fresh egg bread paired off with a German Chocolate flavoured coffee is my Yorkdale morning bliss. 

Please note: service generally okay, the boss sometimes sits in the back corner on his laptop or phone. However, sometimes those waitresses/cashiers behind the counter can get feisty! Ladies: guards should be slightly up!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on an early Friday morning. Had the cream of broccoli soup and a chicken salad sandwich. The cream of broccoli was really watery by still good. The chicken salad sandwich was pretty small but it was better than most places I've tried. However the staff is super unhelpful and rude even. There was no one at the soup counter so we asked someone by the bread if they could help us and they sighed and walked very unwilling to the soup area. We asked another staff where the line to pay was and without eye contact or speaking they just pointed in the general direction. I understand this place is higher quality but the prices are a little high considering there are similar options in the mall for way cheaper."}
{"text":"First time to try this place out after passing by it for so many year. Always thought it only sells pastry and bread. I went with friends and the place inside is big. There are lots of things to choose from. Soup, salad, lasagna, quiche, sandwiches, curry, stew, jerk chicken and etc etc. I ordered the lasagna and jerk chicken with basmati rice. Both are good. They handed out free pastry for people to try and the almond croissant pastry is not bad."}
{"text":"This place is slightly better than the Yorkdale food court in that it's not quite as loud and dirty. The food selection is a bit uninspired for Toronto - this is back-to-basics soup, sandwiches, and salads. That being said, you can probably find something here you won't dislike entirely.

I had a pretty decent 5-bean salad and although it was somewhat overpriced, it was also pretty tasty (and not too oily)! I managed to find a seat on a Friday when the parking lot outside was rammed, so that gives me some hope that finding a table here isn't an exercise in futility.

Check out the freshly baked bread!"}
{"text":"Things do not always taste the way they look.

Hurried and harried service - and ... always tons of customers.  

Meh-tasting baked items.  Even their \"signature\" item (croissant with cheese and broccoli) tasted lackluster and had a droopy appearance.

Bagels are just round pieces of bread, this is not a good schtick of bagel, its round bread.

Meh."}
{"text":"This is a nice Michel's Baguette location. It opens early on Saturdays & it was already busy when we arrived. They have a nice seating area for those who want to eat off their deli style menu. They also have the quick service window where you can buy bread & pastries. Their loaves sell quickly & for the cranberry loaf they were baking a new batch. They said it wouldn't be ready for another 10 minutes. My mom decided to come back for the new batch but by the time we got back it was already sold out! For myself I bought a scone & it was delicious."}
{"text":"This bakery looks awesome. Such a unique and large selection. You have to go and see. I had the eggplant parmesan croissant. I loved the idea of it and the taste was just as good. I wish I had more room to try more of their savory items and the desserty things were too many to count. Go and just look at the display case."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that bad. But it is always so crowded and busy. There is a lot of choices on the menu but there doesn't seem to be anything special. It is all soups, sandwiches, deserts etc. The prices weren't so bad. There seems to always be a lot of employees and they seem to be hustling around looking busy, I had to call for them multiple times until they finally gave me my food. 

Seating is really hard to find. So I suggest just sticking to their deserts and taking out the food instead of dining there."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my goto stops while at yorkdale. It is very inconvenient when your washroom is being occupied and the men's washroom doesn't have a change table it makes it very difficult for parents. Your staff also threw out the entire feeding kit for my kids. When I returned after 3mins of realizing I may have left it behind. No one even bothered to keep it on hold in case we returned. Not coming back."}
