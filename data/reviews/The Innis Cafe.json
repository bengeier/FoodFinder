{"text":"Awesome prices, huge portions, great taste. The grand trifecta! 

Honestly the best value for dining on campus. The spanakopita is freshly made every day, and the pastries are made from scratch. Their meals and salads are tasty and filling. Their juice bar is absolutely highly recommended. $3.50 for a small (12oz) juice, with the largest size at around $5-6. You can blend whatever combo you'd like and they'll charge the same price. Considering the exorbitant pricing on juices in Toronto, this cafe is a godsend.

There's some seating available on the  window side of the cafe, and also great picnic tables just outside in the courtyard if you are craving some sun."}
{"text":"Just fantastic. Can't describe how refreshing it is to eat fresh and home-made food on campus. Excellent pricing. Their 8.80 lunch combo (most pricy) is filling. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"$5.50 for a chicken burrito and salad, incl tax! Tasty, fresh, homemade, friendly. No-brainer."}
{"text":"The staff are really nice. Prime spot and nice environment."}
{"text":"I used to come here 10 years ago when I was a student. I remembered great clubhouse sandwiches with a yummy big generous salad.  I came back today and got my usual with a mango smoothie.  It came up to $16 which seemed higher than back in the day but hey I guess there's inflation.  Clubhouse was still big and tasty would like a little more bacon.  I got the bean salad I used to like that still good and some greens.  Salad portion used to be bigger.  Overall still good, not as big portions as before.  Same friendly service.  Overheard them saying they might be forced to leave Innis in a RFP bid.  Hope they stay."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, and delicious. It's hard to get a seat, and there will probably be a line whenever you go, but the food is good, the prices are low, and I love that I can get fresh juices and smoothies on campus, as well a a decent selection of salads and vegetarian options.

Currently one of my favourite places to grab food on/near campus. It's not fancy, but you're eating on a university campus!"}
{"text":"I always love to stop by here when I don't feel up for the routine poutine, burgers, and hot dogs that most of the nearby food trucks serve.

They serve freshly squeezed fruit+vegetable juice, all day breakfast, hamburgers, salads... a huge variety of delicious and filling meals. The portions are decent and the prices make this place a great option for students on a budget. 

Although they have a debit machine, I recommend you bring cash here just in case. If I could, I would eat here all the time but seating is rather limited during the winter (in warmer weather you could definitely eat outside) and the line-ups can get rather long."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place, it was convenient to come here since I go to UofT and was looking for a quick lunch place. I had the roasted veggies with pasta/salad. It was soooo good. Best roasted veggies ever! My friend also had the beef lasagna and she loved it. Definitely coming back again for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing little cafe tucked in Innis Hall just off St George. Fresh baked treats and culturally inspired dishes. The jerk chicken was delicious and came with a great romain salad featuring quinoa, chic peas, and fava beans. Super fast service too."}
{"text":"I was TRICKED by all the good reviews and comments about how great this cafe was inside Innis college. To my surprise I was more than disappointed when i got my order from them. I ordered a chicken quesadilla but what I got was a small plate of what looks to be like a chicken wrap with a slice of chicken in it, some melted cheese, and a piece of tomato. (I UPLOADED A PHOTO, PLEASE REVIEW). So guys, what happened to \"good proportions, fresh tasting, and good prices?\" Because all I got was not even what I attempted to order. I call fraud and scam to all the other reviewers. What can I say, I was desperate to look for something actually DECENT to eat within campus and I sure don't need you little stinking liars giving FALSE information. THANK U VERY MUCH!"}
{"text":"Finally! Cheap, filling food on campus that isn't crap! This little cafe tucked away inside an Innis College building at the U of T serves hot plates, burritos, made-to-order salads, sandwiches, fresh juices and smoothies. Come early, as the line-ups can get long during lunch. The people that work there are super-nice. I'm a fan of the burrito -- a chicken burrito and salad will only set you back $5(ish), and you'll be full 'til dinner (if not beyond)."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable and healthy. I've tried most of the menu and the quality has been very consistent. It does tend to get busy during lunch hours though and there are times when I'm forced to eat outside of the caf. The best time to eat at Innis is during the warmer seasons when you can go up to the patios and eat while you take your time and enjoy the sun."}
{"text":"Nice, appropriately-priced food. They have an all day breakfast available for about $5 -$6 each. They have a wide assortment of fresh juices too!

I ordered a daily special of grilled omlete sandwich. Took a few minutes to get, and the serving size was okay, maybe a tad bit on the small side. The omlete was filled with onions, cheese and tomatoes though, definitely a good deal for around $6 with tax. Only caveat is that it is a bit off main campus."}
{"text":"I'm a bit baffled by the positive reviews. This place is a dorm cafe, and it wasn't obvious to someone unfamiliar with Toronto. And unfortunately the  service was sub-par. I ordered an omelette with ham and cheese, and apparently the woman who took my order thought I would like a scrambler on toast instead. The touch screen used to take my order looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months, and the table we sat at demonstrated the same lack of cleanliness. Poor all around."}
{"text":"I was at a conference for 3 days at Innis Hall and ate at this cafe several times. It's awesome. I wish all universities had cafes like this, with homecooked food and a down-to-earth attitude. None of the corporate BS that you get with your usual I would go there even if I wasn't stuck in a dark room listening to lectures. The salads are tasty with generous portions and fresh with beans, pasta, and potato as options to add variety to the usual lettuce tomato mix. There are veggie burgers, burritos, soups, kabobs, smoothies, panini and even fresh squeezed orange juice! The staff is kind and friendly and it's a great value if you are trying to eat cheap. GO TO INNIS CAFE!"}
{"text":"Simple & fresh!

All menus are very simple, but amazingly tasty and fresh.  Prices are also just right.  The best chicken soup ever!"}
{"text":"Good food, ideal place for a quick bite. Very close to Robarts. Might be hard to find if not familiar with Innis college."}
