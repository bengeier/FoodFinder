{"text":"The pizza is good and flavourful, very good dinner option in the west island. The service can be spot on or sometimes very rocky, which can be disappointing. I've been to this restaurant at least once a year since it opened probably 10+ years ago. It's definitely was at its prime in the past and seen better days. However, if looking for an intimate place to grab decent Italian food in the west island, this restaurant should meet expectations...but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here.  Every time I go, I tell myself I will get something other than pizza, but then I think about how awesome the pizza is, and it's pizza again.  It is the best pizza I have had since being in Sicily many years ago.  Cooked in a wood burning oven with very fresh ingredients, the crust is thin and amazing and the toppings are plentiful and fresh.  The menu itself is very extensive, but I just can't get past the pizza, it's just awesome.  One day I may try something else, and I'm sure it will be excellent as well.  When I am in town for business this a go to every time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always for lunch. Great place and great service! Excellent pizza. Thin crust with good variety of choices. Tried their veal with spaghetti; the pasta and its sauce were very good but the veal was tasteless."}
{"text":"Pizza was great !  Pasta was a little on the sweet side which is fine ,  Appetizers needed some salt  We had to wait 50 mins to get our food but it wasn't anything special .  Chicken was cooked perfectly so that a good thing  Would come back ? Maybe ?"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about...Good food..good pizza...good service but nothing out of this world and nothing too exciting (or too negative) to report unfortunately. For me personally, it's not worth the drive but my husband sometimes insists to come because he likes it that much! What I can tell you is that they have a varied menu, so if you're on a health kick or want something other than pizza you will definitely find it."}
{"text":"So many pizza choices! I'm an out of towner that came here based on my aunt's suggestion. She frequently eats here with her family so I assumed the food had to be good. We ordered four pizzas, but one pizza is surely enough to split with another person. I got a Santa Fe pizza. Flavorful and slightly overpriced in my opinion but it's worth it. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good Italian food and wood stove for pizza. Try the pizza."}
{"text":"Good food, very large serving. I had the veggie pasta with goat cheese and it was enjoyable and enough leftovers for 2 more meals at home. Darkest restaurant on the West Island and the tables are a little cramped, but overall nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this little gem of a restaurant on the west island.  The atmosphere is always so warm and inviting, the service is fantastic and the food never disappoints.  On our most recent visit, we arrived a little later than usual (around 8:00 PM) and were pleasantly surprised to find that although it was quite full, there was no line-up.  We'll have to remember that for next time, since the place is always packed if you arrive earlier in the evening.  We started with the mussels marinara and my husband practically licked the bowl clean - the sauce is THAT good!  He then had the angel hair pasta with melted bocconcini and basil in a napolitana sauce which was just the right size for me to savor a few bites - delicious!  I had the salmon from the Table D'hote, which was perfectly cooked and served with a baked potato, fresh vegetables and a sumptuous lemony white wine sauce that was simply divine.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  Although we were eagerly eyeing the desserts as they passed on their way to other tables, after cleaning our plates and emptying the bread basket, we just had no more room at the end of the meal, so instead we finished off with coffee and a digestif.    I have to mention that our waiter was like a mind-reader - appearing with water, bread and freshly grated cheese for the pasta without even having to be asked.  Bonus points for making sure my wine glass was always full!  I definitely recommend this restaurant for a relaxing dinner any time - and in the summer you can also enjoy their cozy terrace."}
{"text":"Arrived early on a weekday afternoon for supper.   Was able to sit on their patio, its in the parking lot of the strip mall, however the flowers are so much in bloom and plentiful you kind of forget your in lot.   Had Straciatella soup to start, loved it!  for the main course, i had the veal and pasta.  It was very good, not too heavy just the right portion size.   They also have  a very good wine list, with a few private imports to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a nice dinner. Started with smoked salmon and calamari. The smoked salmon was amazing but the calamari wasn't the freshest. For my main, I order the same pizza every time because it's so good and i can't choose anything else. It's called the \"Caparina\",  it has goat cheese, spinach and pine nuts. The service was on point, the waitress was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time for my birthday, we all had a really great time and received a good service. I would definitely come back to try other pizzas, but in the summer time to try the terrace, you'll see there are lots of choices to choose from. I tried the West Island pizza and I really liked it. You can ask for your pizza to have two different toppings. Love that they have a pizza oven, it makes all the difference ! The ambiance is really joyful and it was pretty busy on the Saturday night we went, so try t to reserve just in case !"}
{"text":"I've eaten there many times, have had the pizza, the pasta, veal, chicken etc and all were delicious. My daughter had her sweet 16 party there and the staff gave the kids the same service and consideration as anyone else. We often bring home food as the portions are generous - not american size but generous all the same.  Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Premiere visite à ce restaurant ouvert depuis 20 ans. Belle salle a manger de restaurant chic mais les prix sont abordables.  Les pizzas cuites au four sont délicieuses et le choix est incroyable.  Bon choix de vins. Se service par Emilie était parfait.  Stationnement un pu difficile.  J'y retourne c'est certain."}
{"text":"Last night I had the seafood past and loved it.  Will definitely try one of their pizza's the next time I come as they cook it in a wood oven."}
{"text":"Le Vieux four Mango is located in a strip mall on St. Charles Blvd in Pierrefonds. It has a nice layout with ample seating. They also have a terrace . They have a wood pizza oven right when you walk-in . The menu has a great selection from salads, pasta, pizza,chicken and veal. I had a hard time deciding which pizza since they have about 25 to choose from. I ordered the SANTA Fe pizza which comes with chicken bacon tomatoes and onions. The crust was thin and crispy. I would say it was good but a little dry. The chilli oil did add a nice kick to it . My wife  had the mango avocado salad which she say was amazing. Catherine our sever was very helpful in recommending  items in the menu. The only negative was there was no servers or helpers in our area for a good 10 minutes so  getting napkins and refills on water was unacceptable. We will be back and this place is a nice hidden gem where the local do eat. This was a hit ."}
{"text":"I came for lunch while on business in Montreal.  Parking seems like a nightmare - I don't know if I should attribute it to the small lot, the icy roads, or the bad drivers (kidding!) but everyone seemed to take up 1.5 spots.  No matter.   It wasn't very busy at lunchtime.  I didn't have their pizza - I decided to be adventurous and try their pesto pasta (with cranberries and nuts and goat cheese).  It seemed a strange mixture on paper but it was the most savory delicious pasta I've had.  The heavy cream was contrasted by the bite of the cranberries and crunch of the nuts.  It was enough that I saved my leftovers (despite having company-paid meals).    This place makes me think the cold winters are worth it!  (almost)"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a luminous feel with very high  ceilings, a cottage like-feel. The house salad is fresh with a light vinaigrette and the onion mixed in was good, not too strong.  I ate my meal so quickly because it was so good, the veggies had so much butter and everything was cooked perfectly.  With a generous amount of veggie, the meal still felt healthy. My friends ordered pasta and sandwich, even thought they did not eat as fast as I, they were all satisfied."}
{"text":"Le Vieux Four Manago has the usual Italian food, plus a wood-burning pizza oven. I was pleasantly surprised by the Salmon Pasta. Otherwise, everything is just fine."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe italienne, une coche au-dessus de Scarolies sur St-Jean, atmosphère plus moderne, vaste salle mais parking limite. Je devrais y aller plus souvent pour le lunch.  Pour les clients, Mundo Trattoria ou Mezzagiorno (ou La Serenata) serait plus judicieux, pour le soir du moins."}
