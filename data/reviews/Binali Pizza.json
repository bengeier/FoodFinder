{"text":"Great food and friendly service!!!   They make an amazing Pie!  Pizza that is.  Everything they make is great.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Expect your order to arrive 2hrs30mins late, but do not expect them to tell you on the phone.  Expect to not understand anything they say, but do expect to be very frustrated by lack of professionalism."}
{"text":"the food was HORRIBLE!  I have ordered before and it was okay.   This time staff didn't know what she was doing, even after putting the manager on, he didn't get it right either.  The food was cold, salad was hot - go figure.  Soup was the ONLY thing that hot and half decent - never again"}
{"text":"This place has gone through 3 name changes in the past few years. Each time it has gotten worse. This used to be our number one choice for delivery, but now only when we want certain things. Even then I hesitate, because of the bad service we have received. 

I love their popcorn chicken \"salad.\" It's a pittsburgh salad. Be prepared for tons of slightly spicy round crinkle fries and cheese. It's good if you aren't trying to eat a real salad.

Pizza is meh. Used to be good. :-(

What IS nice is that they have just about everything. Burritos, pasta, gyros, falafel, kabob and more. No one in your ordering party will be disappointed. That is, unless they forget half of your order, which is possible.

Half of the time, ordering is a hassle. The person taking the orders can either be with it and all is fine, or you can totally not understand each other and have to repeat everything and god forbid you have a \"special\" request. 

Delivery. Oh, delivery... They have this one guy that has been to our house probably 15 times and still gets lost. Then he just drops off the food, cold and late, with no apology. Dude is just gruff. I get that he is not a native english speaker, but a hello and a smile goes a long way. And really. Half of the time our order is wrong too."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic.  Never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Friendly staff and quick delivery times"}
{"text":"Would of gave one more star but gyro did not come with any sauce and no tomato. The meat was pretty good but it was super dry. The fries that came with the platter were inedible.  Just a soggy mess. I also got a med. Cheese pizza which was not bad but not memorable. Like I said, just 2 stars cause of no cucumber sauce and tomato for gyro. Otherwise, would have been 3 stars. I will probably give them another chance because of diversity in the menu."}
{"text":"Way out on Library Road is a very good little pizza joint. Their Ultimate Meat Pizza is pretty darn tasty. I'd recommend it if you live around there. We had to eat-in here sicne we're out of their delivery zone."}
{"text":"Ordered a Kabob today and bogie today. Hoagie was good, however the kabob came as a mound of rice with random pieces of chicken tossed in it. This left a bad impression. Called to ask why it came as is, it evidently ALWAYS comes this way unless you specify you would like it on a stick. several items out of stock... No notification on that. You'll just get a pile of rice instead."}
{"text":"I love this pizza!!! We used yo live 45min away from this place, and would still drive twice a week to get it! We had moved and now live somewhere else..Is it still open?"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from them was great, but after that, overcharged, undercooked, wedgies with almost nothing inside them, forgot ot bring my whole order, 2 hour wait times, made wrong, and got sick. Done with this place."}
{"text":"This is now called Vecenzo Pizza. I made the discovery this weekend when riding past it. Why do pizza shops change hands so often??? Or did it change in name only?"}
