{"text":"I like this place.  The daily lunch specials are good, pizza rolls are excellent, the hogies are great too.  They have good weekly specials in the deli department on meats and cheeses.  The staff are great, very friendly people, I love the mom and pop feel of the place."}
{"text":"I just moved to this neighborhood about a month ago. Being a sandwich fiend, I almost immediately sought out the best sandwich options around. I hit the jackpot when I found Fazio's just a few blocks away.  Fazio's is totally legit! Its actually a pizza and Italian specialty store but at the back of the store is a deli where they make fresh, made to order subs (or Hoagies as they call 'em here) on their own fresh baked rolls. The slice all the meat and cheese to order and that really makes a difference.   Service is fast and friendly although there's usually a small line at lunch so you'll have to wait a few minutes; not long but well worth the wait. The prices are so cheap ya' feel like you're stealing. I mean, I used to own a sandwich shop and I can't imagine how they sell these big, meat packed subs for less then $3.   If you're in the area, give it a try! You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I live in LA, but I come home in the fall, Fazio s is a must, the fresh bread ,rolls, deli meats and cheese,  and always get the olives. I ordered a lg tray of Rigitoni w meat sauce. for my birthday party, it was excellent. Everyone loved it. Great family bussiness, nice people, good prices, and great quality. Im so glad they are still here in my hometown, I ve  been shopping here for atleast 40 yrs. The best:)"}
{"text":"Love this store! I get the pizza \"kits\" .  Get the sauce and shredded cheese out of the fridge and the shells from the deli.  The lunch meat is so fresh.  Don't forget the fresh rolls for your sandwich.  I also pick up the frozen meatballs large ones for when I make spaghetti and small ones for when I make wedding soup."}
{"text":"It is in the restaurants section and it is definitely NOT A RESTAURANT.  What food they do offer is what they feel like cooking that day, once a day at lunchtime. There website is inaccurate and there excuse was that the password was forgotten. The one thing I did go there for, is now only offered in the frozen section for you to take home and cook yourself. Does anyone do tortellini justice anymore? Or is it all frozen?  What I ended up getting was the pizza pillows, which I was told was filled with pepperoni, sauce, and cheese. If all that was in there it was ground down to a paste and a thin layer was placed on each \"pillow\"."}
