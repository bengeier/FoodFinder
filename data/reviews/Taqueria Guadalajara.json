{"text":"One of the most perfect, small, family run Mexican food places that I ever encountered. Atmosphere was authentic, the place is clean and the food is great. Not upscale by no means. I had a Huaracha for the first time, and I loved it; it is loaded with good ingredients (including a cactus, which I had for the first time and it was great). I stumbled upon the place following a Yelp recommendation, and was shocked at first how tiny the place is, but you discover there is more to it later. Although, try to sit at the bar if you can (if you like it), for a feeling different from other usual Mexican joints."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast before the Great Taste. I was trying to find a Mexican part of town, and just happened to see the pink house looking building.  I could not have done better.   This is real Mexican food. A small joint, devoid of gimmicks and frills. The staff was super friendly, and there was a soccer game on tv. You know you have found a decent place to eat when they lead you through the (tiny, but clean) kitchen to your table.   I had a steak huarache and a lengua taco, and they were deliciously devoid of the massive piles of melted cheese some places use to hide the fact that their food sucks.   This is the good stuff. Fresh and bright flavors for a great price. I will make a point to stop here anytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review yet.  This place has the best Mexican food I've found so far in Madison (I've had better elsewhere, but it really is quite good for serving white bread Wisconsinites) and they are quite affordable!  SO sticks with the Lomo de Puerco en Salsa Verde every time, tender with a nice heat. I jump around and have tried a variety of taco, burrito, quesadilla, and platillo combinations. I recommend pork for your choice of meat, flavorful but not tough or stringy. Definitely try a horchata, Mexican Coke, or Jarritos with your meal. Tamarind Jarritos is my favorite.  The place is small, with a pick up spot and small counter in front, with maybe 10 tables in the back. I recommend an early lunch/dinner especially if you want a meal on the weekends (!!) so you don't have to wait in the cramped space up front (the line extends outside even during winter..). Thankfully food comes out pretty fast and you get free salsa and chips to curb your hunger pangs."}
{"text":"i'm from california and i think that this is the best mexican place in madison!"}
{"text":"I loved this place for one reason only. It reminded me of all the divey Latin American places I've eaten at while abroad: Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, etc.  The food was good and decently priced and the ambience was totally authentic: dirty, tiny, black and white TV, flies buzzing around.... Great place."}
{"text":"My new fave: tripa tacos!! And the menudos aren't bad, either.."}
{"text":"You will not find better mexican food in Madison, that's a sure thing, possibly all of Wisconsin, maybe something decent in Milwaukee. This is the closest thing to the kick-ass mexican offered in Los Angeles. If you expect to be seated in a middle of the road white surburban scared of foreigners sort of way, you're way out of your league. Go back to Applebee's. This is a family owned and run authentic mexican joint. They know what they are doing and they do it well. I have found the tamales to be pretty awesome, the burrito is okay, the fresh salsa is amazing and spicy, I love the roasted jalapenos, of course I do that at home myself now, my wife likes the tortas. I've had the Guadalajara plate, which was pretty good. Try some things that you would not normally try, and have some new experiences. It might not be super duper fantastic to you, but then you know what you like and what you don't.  If you go to LA ever, try La Fogata's on Van Nuys in Sherman Oaks. That is truly kick-ass, the fresh salsa, the burritos, the tamales, etc. That would get 5 stars for sure, and compared to La Fogata's in LA, this place in Madison would probably be 3.5 stars. But I gave it 5 based on Madison, and what little quality food there is in Wisconsin in general, unless all you eat are brats and cheese, then you are in the right place! Go Badgers?"}
{"text":"So let me start out by saying I'm not a chimichanga kind of person. I don't usually like how heavy and bland they are. BUT taqueria Guadalajara has converted me.  The chimichanga outside was crispy yet fluffy, and inside the extra cheese and beef was just awesome. I felt like I was eating the best meat pastry ever (because I probably was). It was also a good portion and only 7 bucks.  I also tried the huaraches (the regular ones). They left a little bit to be desired. They were not as flavorful as I expected. The guacamole was also not very good (probably came out of a can), and the fried jalapeños were not at all what I expected. They weren't bad, but they were not anything like a jalapeño popper. The beef tacos were solid.  The bottom line: I will be back for the chimichanga, and will probably never get around to trying anything else."}
{"text":"I thought we had finally found an awesome neighborhood Mexican place, but nope, the food kind of sucked.  My gorditas tasted kind of old.  The steak was chewy and tasted kind of weird.  The burrito was bland and very soggy.  Aren't they supposed to fry it a little on the grill first?    I feel bad saying it because the atmosphere was so cool.  It was little and cramped and the furniture was shitty.  There was a tv!  And like kids running around screaming who were somehow attached to the people running the place.    Oh well, maybe they were having an off night or something"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Madison.  I had lost all hope when I visited multiple \"Mexican\" restaurants and they put velveeta cheese on everything.  Then I ate at Taqueria Guadalajara and I am so happy that I did!  The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and I am happy to report that they use non-synthetic cheese. Score!  I usually get the Burrito Mexicano or chicken tacos, but anything on the menu is sure to satisfy you and won't break your budget.    I feel like I need to get a burrito right now after writing this review! Luckily they do take-out.  :)"}
{"text":"I am from Texas and I have tried every variation of Mexican food you can imagine.  The food at Taqueria is basic, satisfying, and comforting.  There is also a sense of community at Taqueria that makes the place very special.   Go there with an open mind and keep your expectations at \"great food for the price\" and you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"We had a party of 22 that I made a reservation for, not realizing how small the restaurant is. While they couldn't guarantee that they'd have a table ready, they were able to seat ALL of us within ten minutes, and even added chairs for a few add-ons. The service was impeccable; one server managed to take care of our tables seemingly effortlessly. Everyone got their food at the same time. No mistakes. Deliciousness ensued. It was a wonderful dinner. Some of the best service and food we've had in Madison. I will definitely, definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is seriously in my top 3 restaurants in Madison. Whenever I can't decide where to eat, I end up here. The enchiladas de mole (with cheese) are incredible and are always my go-to. I've had other entrees including the huarache and chile relleno, both of which are also incredible. The service is always fast and the food is always hot. As for drinks, the horchata is excellent, as well as the champurrado. The only way this place could get better is if they served margaritas. I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"I love this place and for a while when they closed down after the fire I was so sad thinking that is it for my favorite mexican food place. Heaved a sigh of relief when they re-opened, and boy, were they popular! They weeks right after the re-opening saw huge crowds even after they expanded their sitting area. You can tell this place is authentic by the sheer number of mexican diners ~~  The moment you get seated they will start you off with water and tortilla chips with salsa while you look over the menu and wait for your food.  Love their huarache and their tortas. And the grilled cactus plate. Well you could hardly go wrong with mexican grilled meat, potatoes, fresh salsa and avocado/guacamole etc. And these are all made to perfection!  If you visit on weekends, they have the menudo, a soup with beef tribe (stomach). Caution: The serving for that is humongous! Probably that alone will fill you up, so if you are going to order something else in addition, might be a good idea to split the soup with your group.   I can't stop going on and on about this place. Their service is awesome for such a busy eatery. The waitresses are always smiling and friendly and service is prompt. If you like, you can also sit at the counter area where you can watch the chefs grilling the meat as you munch away on yours =)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very impressed with Taqueria Guadalajara!! I got the chicken enchiladas - and they were divine. The staff was friendly and FAST! Seriously delicious authentic Mexican food. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Only cons are seating space and no margaritas. However, I wouldn't want TG to change their location, because it's the home town feel that makes them the diamond in the ruff that they are."}
{"text":"The food at Taqueria Guadalajara is at least as good as the Mexican food I got used to back when I lived in Northern California. I usually opt for their excellent tacos (try the delicious lengua de res [beef tongue]), but the sopes are also terrific.  The atmosphere is definitely homey and a little run down. I try to sit at the counter because I enjoy watching the action in the kitchen, but also because the back room where most of the tables are is a bit depressing and claustrophobic.  Another plus for Taqueria Guadalajara is the friendly and attentive staff. And the prices! I'm always way over-tipping here because I feel like I'm not paying nearly enough for the delicious and filling food."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic and cheap spot, very small and very low-key but definitely the best Mexican food around.  Viva la horchata"}
{"text":"It's easy to miss this place when driving by. It's such a small place, but the food is great. I ordered a wet burrito with chicken and 2 tacos (1 carne asada, 1 beef tongue). Yep, you read it right, beef tongue. All the food was fresh, authentic, and most importantly, delicious! I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Madison from out of town, and this place reportedly had good Mexican food. I am not a snooty restaurant goer in the least, but I was initially off-put by how dirty the kitchen and dining area were. Not enough to make me leave, but enough to leave a bad first impression. The restaurant is also very crowded and uncomfortable to sit in. The food was good and authentic, but I've had better in cleaner environments."}
{"text":"Terrible with vegetarian requests. I've been there twice, ordered a vegetarian meal twice, and found chicken pieces in my meal halfway through... Twice."}
{"text":"\"Mexican food\" is such a loose term in Madison. Some people think that Pedro's or Laredos are good places to find the elusive, delicious and authentic fare but they'd be wrong. If I can hear the staff speaking in mostly English then I know the food won't be what I'm looking for. If my tacos come with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream then I'm looking for the nearest salida.  Taqueria Guadalajara is hands-down the best place to find authentic and tasty Mexican food.   They do it right: fast, friendly service, authentic meals and a very reasonable, if not underpriced, price point. This place is a home run and it's somewhat unassuming from the outside. I haven't had a single item from the menu that didn't make me want to keep eating. This place is the epitome of Mexico. Come here and eat some good food but don't be \"that guy\" and order flour tortillas. That's what Taco Bell is for."}
{"text":"Amazing, cheap, authentic tacos.  Hard to find and not in a great neighborhood, but well worth it.  I really enjoyed the al pastor and the lengua tacos."}
{"text":"We frequent taco shops around the valley. I'm putting this place ar the top of my list! Excellent food and service. Also comes with free chips and salsa like a sit down restaurant!   Very happy with my carne asada burrito.  According to my husband the other types of burritos are just as good :)"}
{"text":"My review on Food Coma:  Don't let the peeling paint and crumbling exterior fool you.  Taqueria Guadalajara is has the best mexican food in town.  Get a table in the back dining room, and prepare for a culinary trip south of the border.    Read more: http://foodiecoma.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/taqueria-guadalajara/"}
{"text":"Always enjoy an afternoon meal here. Food is consistent. Cooked with proper temperature. Even when it's been busy, we haven't waited an excessive amount of time for our meal.   The grilled cactus wasn't good.   I'll come back"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Madison. Very small inside so it can get crowded, but service is good and food doesn't take long to come out."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed after dining in this week. Service isn't quite as friendly, good, or efficient as it used to be. They literally give you two tablespoons of salsa on first pour, with a few chips. My husband ordered a steak dish that was mostly onion and a few pieces of sparse steak. It looked nothing like the picture. Everything tastes good, it just seems they are getting skimpy on ingredients. I hope that changes soon, as competition is heating up for tacos in Madison! I won't abandon this place, but it might want to revisit its business plan. If they can't keep up with the costs, the menu could stand to go up in price just a tad to make up for it. I'll see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"I think this is the best place in Madison for Mexican food. I could be wrong but there really arent that many places and this one is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Simply the best in town, maybe even the state, but I haven't tried them all.  This place has the look, the feel, the hospitality, the amazing flavors and great prices.  Enchiladas + Negro Modelo = Happiness"}
{"text":"I like this place, always my go to for good tacos!  But all the food is good.  Make sure you try different things in the menu, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As many have noted, their roast pork is absolutely delicious. Be sure to order at least 1 of your sope, gordita, or taco order with the pork. So flavorful and moist.  The gorditas were better than the tacos, in my opinion. Corn tortillas were a little chewy for us, but the gorditas had a nice crispy exterior with the cheese and refried beans which add to the flavour.  Also had a burrito, which is really good as well. Not quite as much meat as I would have preferred, but the variety of ingredients within does provide a good flavor profile.  Overall it's relatively inexpensive, very flavorful, and efficient service."}
{"text":"Words (except these) cannot explain the FRESH, AMAZING, wonderful flavors.  It was like being back in SoCal.  Carne asada tacos were outstanding. My husband ordered a torta which was also outstanding. Prices-great! Everything was on point. Will return soon!  Clearly this place is popular and the seating is crammed so the space literally fills up and gets cramped, so don't attempt to dine during lunch there because it was packed, and there will be nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"Fresh food, well made, great service. We were looking for a casual meal while visiting Madison. We were very happy to find this little gem. Not a huge menu but they do it all well."}
{"text":"Best. Mexican. Food. In. Madison. Always good.  Always full of people. Recently opened a new seating area that doubles their capacity.  I you check the wall, you will see tha this tiny hole in the wall was suggested by a national newspaper as one of the best places in the nation for Mexican fare.  It is delicious, it is quick, it is very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Really good tacos and salsa.  Nothing too special about the place.  I've dined in and gotten delivery.  Will get it again, no doubt."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat here. The food is great and the staff are friendly! My favorites are the tacos de lengua and asada."}
{"text":"There must be a reason why these are listed as the first items in Taqueria Guadalajara's menu.    Out of the extensive lists of Tex-Mex Mexican inspired items (burritos, enchiladas, etc) these are the truly authentic Mexican items in this taqueria.  The key item is the taco. What are they?  These are small soft corn tortillas with your choice of carne asada, pastor, chicken and if you happen to be truly adventurous even tongue.  Eat them like they do throughout Mexico. Asked them with a bunch of cilantro and onion, top it off with a glob of guacamole and a spoonful of the house hot sauce.  If you want them American style then you can always sub the cilantro for lettuce and tomatoes and even make them more American by adding cheese or sour cream.  In my book everything else at this taqueria is decoration. If you eat the tacos as described above you will step out of Taqueria Guadalajara as if you have just stepped out one of the best taqueria anywhere in Mexico.  After all the restaurant name says it all \"taqueria\" that translates closely as \"Tacos stall\" in Spanish.  If you have a sweet tooth drink a cold horchata, a cold Mexican CocaCola or a cerveza fria to ease down the incredible tacos.  TREMENDOS TACOS!  I rate this 5 star for value, freshness and for an authentic flavor of Mexico."}
{"text":"Great simple, affordable, and authentic. 'nuff said.   The entrance is misleading, there is more seating in the back."}
{"text":"Lord how do people ever give this place less than a five!! This place is the best authentic Mexican food in town. I've been going here for the past five years, throughout college and beyond. No other place in town can hold a candle to their quality, and the price is really excellent!! LOVE their tacos, enchiladas, horchata, sopes, everything. Service is always amazing. Love these guys. Had a fire and were closed for a while last year and I was on Mexican food withdrawal. Glad they're back and going stronger than ever!!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why everyone raves about Taqueria Guadalajara. Although the atmosphere is cool, because it seems like a real family owned restaurant, the food is subpar. I have eaten here on a couple of occasions in order to try to convince myself that my opinion was incorrect, but there is better Mexican to be had in Madison.   Inexpensive and quick, but other than that it lacks."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food this is the place. inexpensive too."}
{"text":"Try as I might...I always end up ordering tres tacos de carne asada...con todos...whenever we go here.  If you've never had real Mexican tacos...served on the street preferably, you don't know what you're missing.  It's simple, street food...but so delicious! The carne flavor is transcendent...and when coupled with onions & cilantro...and real corn tortillas...and the essential salsa...ephemerally flavorful and satisfying.  My bf sometimes opts for the huarches...a spectacularly beautiful combination of meat, beans, avocado, lettuce and cheese with a drizzling of sour cream...all in appropriate quantities instead of the typical Americanized Mexican where everything is drenched in cheese or sauce...  Go.  Eat.  Savor...and take some to go...it's equally good or better later or the next day..."}
{"text":"I tried the nachos mexicanos vegetarian style. Don't get this. It's pretty looking but not enjoyable. The cheese goes cold fast and then it's just rubber when you get it. It's quite dry. The beans are at the bottom somewhere and just a little of it. Sour cream was nonexistent."}
{"text":"Been there 2 times!! Maria has great service!! Food was amazing!!!! It's packed with people which means people want to eat there!!!! Keep up the good work!! Parking is limited."}
{"text":"Visiting from Michigan and ordered dinners for the family.  Delicious and very tasty.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly even when they are very busy. The great food helped to ease the pain of the first round loss by the MSU Spartans men's basketball team."}
{"text":"Horchata is awesome! Food is good. Great prices!  The place is always packed during lunch, so its not a place to go to if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great, authentic, inexpensive Mexican.   I especially recommend the chile relleno.   Fast service, but in no way, \"fast food.\" Difficult to get extra chips and more delicious salsa out of the wait staff (in either Spanish or English).  Noisy, back dining room. Don't come here to hold a meeting."}
{"text":"Bomb ass authentic Mexican food! I travel the continental united states for work, ever week it's a different city/town and this place is an absolute Gem! Will be returning everytime I visit Madison!"}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in Madison. Don't trick yourself into believing anything else."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, better than La Hacienda!"}
{"text":"I've been here for the past 7 years of my life at least once a week. I never learned how much I should appreciate this food until they closed for a few months. I've had everything in the menu from A-Z. Some items were better than others of course, but they all satisfied my expectations. Let it also be known that I have high standards when it comes to food."}
{"text":"I was excited that they served taco de lengua beside taco de pastor which is a common type of tacos. The salsa sauces were perfect to me. I really like the spicy one but not for mi amigos mexicanos. Lol  only complaint is they didn't serve a lot of pieces of lime same as in Mexico,  it's just small piece of it on the plate and that is not enough for the real tastes of Mexican foods.  I also had sopa de pozole. It's tasier than when I had in Mexico, maybe bcoz of the well prepared broth. The ambient was just right. It made me think of the taco places in Mexico. All in all, I definitely recommend u guys for this place if u feel like going out of the American atmosphere for an hour. :)"}
{"text":"Growing up in southern California, just over an hour away from the Mexican border. I know what qualifies as authentic Mexican food. Since moving to attending the University of Wisconsin finding a quality Mexican joint was on my to do list. After several other failed attempts, i found Taqueria Guadalajara. SoCal Mexican food authenticity right here in madison. Their menudo is the best in the area. I would recommend this place over any other mexican food joint in the area. Keep up the great work.  -loyal customer"}
{"text":"best mexican restaurant in madison, hands down, no question.  it always amazes me that (clueless) people rave about laredos and all the other toned down spots here in madison.  that stuff is not mexican food, that stuff is taco bell.  this is the real deal.  place is a little divey, and is packed most times, so expect a wait. but the wait is worth it. IT IS PACKED FOR A REASON.  oh, and not only is the food excellent, it is cheap as hell. i have paid more at culvers for lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison.  The prices are great, the food is delicious, and they even have non-boring vegetarian options, especially the vegetarian huarache and sope, and the potato gordita.   I'm from Portland OR, where you can find pretty good Mexican food.  This place is by far the best Mexican food I've had in Madison, and beats anything I could find in Pittsburgh, PA.  It even rivals my favorite Oregon Mexican places in Portland (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sirenita-portland) and Eugene (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-siena-eugene).  If you go, be sure to try a sope or huerache if you've never had one before.  As far as I can tell the huerache is the bigger version of the sope.  The base is a 1/2 inch thick (!) soft corn tortilla, made there and freshly grilled.  Next come the beans.  The vegetarian ones are then topped with grilled veggies, including broccoli and carrots, and a generous amount of fresh avocado (scooped right out of the skin while you wait), and finally cheese and sour cream.  Add some of the delicious homemade salsa (there are two kinds) they serve with the free corn chips, and you've got the best meal in town :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Came with family just 5 mins before closing and they entertained us without any issues."}
{"text":"Food made with love by lovely people.I eat there often and  I love this place and the people who own it and work there. everything is damn good. last year the kitchen staff came out and sang to me on my birthday too... I don't know what else I can say...except the Mi Rancho is a hell of a meal for any cowboy!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Madison and have been CRAVING tacos for the past month.  I stopped in for the first time last night on the recommendation of a good friend, and am I glad he told me about this place.  Firstly, the atmosphere is GREAT.  I love the the small, cramped, homey feeling of the restaurant.  The fact that it's a converted house gives it extra character.  You walk in and there's barely enough room for a table, let alone customers.   I had steak, chicken and pork tacos with rice and beans.  Topped with fresh cilantro and onions and paired with a Dos Equis, it's just what I needed to finish off a lazy Sunday.    Did I mention it's CHEAP!  I'll definitely be satisfying my taco cravings here again soon."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week and I loved it. The moment we walked in, we were seated at the bar where the smiling waitress immediately gave us chips and salsa. As soon as we ordered our beef tongue tacos and carne asada tacos, we had to wait about 5 minutes to get our food (and personally, I was so drawn into the soap opera on the TV, I hadn't even noticed). Everything was delicious. The meat and the tortillas were hot and fresh, sprinkled with cilantro and a splash of fresh lime. We devoured our meal in no time flat.  The best part is that it was crazy cheap! We spent under $20 for two people with a ton of tacos and beer. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally...a real Mexican restaurant in Madison. Order ahead and take out. This is as authentic as it gets in Madison. The key......no yellow cheddar cheese. A good friend from Mexico taught me they only use white cheese in Mexico....The menu is varied with items I've never heard of before. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town that I have found.  This is a gem of a hole in the wall Mexican joint.  When we got there the restaurant was totally packed.  We took the only seat available, which just happened to be on Univision adding to the experience.    The food was great, and very well priced also."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  It's literally walking into someone's house and enjoying their food.  The staff and even other patrons have always been friendly to me, no matter how crowded it gets during lunch.  Definitely the best Mexican food I've had in Madison.  Very inexpensive, nicely portioned, most importantly delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is hands down, unbelievably delicious... we typically get the chicken or veggie tacos and the chile relleno... and extra chips and salsa please! Whenever we have a hankering for authentic, flavorful, awaken your taste buds food we come here... our toddler loves it too!"}
{"text":"Let's start of with a great atmosphere. The place is small but cozy and has great smell of authentic Mexican Food!! The staff is great and friendly!! But the best part was the food the tacos were great I especially like the chopped cilantro and onions on the top it gave it great flavor! The only complaint I had the chips were cold and bland! Overall it was a great experience"}
{"text":"These are my favorite tacos in Phx thus far and for $.99 each who can beat it?! The food and the price is more than right, the hours? Well that's very odd. Closed Sun-Weds. Then open until 6pm? They must make their money catering, but I'll make it work to get there when they are open because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, I know Mexican food. Taqueria Guadalajara has great food, but lack of atmosphere. A lot of people were getting food to go while we were there."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. They have amazing amazing food. The service is speedy and friendly. Try the Mole. Its out of control delicious."}
{"text":"We came here on a yelp recommendation and were not disappointed.  If you are looking for haute cuisine, this is not your place, but if you love authentic and inexpensive Mexican food, look no further.   We ate here twice about 10 days apart, and the second time we came were were thrilled to find that the back room with additional seating was finished being built.  We didn't have to wait for a table.  Although we liked the new spacious area, I have to admit that there is some charm in eating at the bar and watching all of the food being made."}
{"text":"When we hit Madison we go here.  We could go anywhere....we go here.  My girlfriend has sampled the menu way more than I have.  I had the chicken mole when she first showed this ex-west-coaster this place, I've never ordered anything else in two years.  It's always been very friendly.  They're always busy but food is still served without a long wait. Great prices.  Last time we were there they had a sign stating they would prefer if you paid cash.  They still would take debit or credit though.  We had cash so we paid in cash.   I imagine margins are tight and even small credit card charges make a difference.  I will remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by its cover.  Okay, this place is pretty shabby looking with the neon pink paint and all. This shack isn't necessarily HGTV-worthy inside either. BUT, the food here is amazing!  My friends, a Bolivian-American and Mexican-American, adore this place so I HAD to check it out. We dined in, which wasn't the best experience ever, but the waiter (I think he is the son of the owner) was so sweet and helpful.  If you want authentic mexican food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Yummy, authentic Mexican food and sweet staff. Quaint restaurant with outdoor patio -- not very glamorous, but has character. Location is good with parking in back. I have been with a friend and for small gatherings; they accommodate small (2) and larger (10) groups."}
{"text":"I come from California, so I've had my fair share of excellent Mexican food, and Taqueria Guadalajara is definitely on par with some of the best Mexican food I've had.  My favorite item here is straightforward: steak tacos. Fresh, soft corn tortillas packed with fresh seasoned steak, onions, cilantro, and lime. It's heaven, plain and simple. Their other meats are of course excellent as well, chicken and chorizo are my other favorites, but seriously, I wouldn't mind only eating their steak tacos for the rest of my life. Would also recommend a horchata to go along with your meal. Many places in California are guilty of diluting their horchatas, but not in Wisconsin!   Ever since finding out about this place, I now go every week, usually twice when I'm desperate, and always sit at the counter. Always amazing service, and amazing food. Will continue to go here every week while I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos!!! This is the place to get them. They are perfect!!! And cooked on the trompo which is the only way to cook them."}
{"text":"Ok, this is not my favorite taqueria, but it is good. The biggest issue here is that the meat quality seems to vary, sometimes a bit tuff, sometimes a little overdone, but when they get it right, it's very good. My wife loves the place for the roasted jalepenos and onions. They are scrumptious, but my fave items are the salsas, you have to try them."}
{"text":"Best in Madison, easily...More like a 4.66-star place, with 5 stars reserved for my favorite taquerias in L.A. (Tito's, Cactus)  -- It's dirt cheap and tasty, but what makes this place work so well for me is that it's always busy, so everything is super fresh, which really is the key for this type of food..."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food I've ever had! Don't let the exterior of the building turn you away...the pink paint makes it look a little sketchy, but the taste of the food put out by this kitchen is off the charts.  To start with, there are 2 kinds of salsa that are really good. Then, I had the Huaraches with steak...so good! My boyfriend ate a chicken chimichanga..best chimichanga either of us has ever tried! The portion sizes are huge, and the prices are really good. Definitely a place I will visit again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I never Yelp places since I started using it about 6 years ago, but this place is  .  Watch out for the habenero salsa."}
{"text":"Great prices that can't be beat! We paid $13 before tip which included 2 dinners and beer. Don't let the small size fool you either - there's plenty of seating in back and it's usually busy with locals who have discovered this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Favorites include cheese mole enchiladas and platilo guatelahara  which includes thinly grilled steak, fried jalepeno, onions, beans and nopale salad...mmmm so good."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. The wait staff was good and were very helpful ordering our food. I had the chicken mole enchiladas. My lovely wife had the carnitas quesadillas. And we split a Chiles Relleno. Food was hot and okay. It lacked some flavor. Making me wonder if the food was frozen not fresh. Definitely needed more spices. Especially the mole sauce. Not great, just average.  Would try the other Mexican restaurants in the area before I would go here again."}
{"text":"Upon further review... if it were between Taqueria el Asadero in Chicago and Taqueria Guadalajara in Madison, Asadero would win every time when it came to steak tacos, steak burritos or any other item containing steak. Otherwise, Guadalajara would win on every other dimension."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends and I had been meaning to try out this place because it is so close to where I live, usually looks busy, and we are curious people. We finally got around to it last night, and it was the best homemade Mexican food I have had yet in Madison!  The front part has a dining counter with a grill, which looked inviting, but we sat in the back part of the restaurant with tables. The two salsas they serve before the meal are great - although the green salsa was a bit more spicy than I prefer, it was still delicious, and I'm sure people with a higher tolerance for heat would absolutely love it.    I had a burrito mexicano (which comes with mild red salsa, sour cream and guacamole spread on the top to look like a Mexican flag) with steak. It tasted far better than any burrito I'd had in recent memory. I was surprised at how few beans were in it, but it may have been because the two people I was with ordered theirs with no beans and they came back a couple of times to make sure they had our order correct. I was happy with the staff there for that very reason and also because they were just pleasant to begin with.  For what you get, there's no beating the price, either :) I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  Small place but worth the wait if there is one. Tried the burrito, tacos and enchilada. All excellent.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Then enchilada was crispy. The way it should be. Both salsas were excellent. Just wish there were margaritas,  but i understand....laws."}
{"text":"If you like real authentic Mexican food you have to eat here. The tortas are amazing.  Have to spend $10.00 to use a debit card but the food is so good you won't mind."}
{"text":"For the life of me I cannot figure out how this place got so many raving reviews. Granted, my boyfriend I have lived in San Diego, El Paso, and Las Vegas and perhaps the bar is a bit higher there for what qualifies as decent Mexican food.   This **hands down** was some of the worst Mexican food I have ever had. To the point that I ate a tiny bit of my meal and didn't want to take any home to relive that horrible experience. My boyfriend and I got the enchiladas de mole, chile relleno, carne el pastor tacos, and a gordita.  First, the enchiladas de mole. OK. Mole sauce is the crown jewel of Mexican food. Maybe this was too hard a test for the first encounter. But the \"mole\" tasted like it was the mole sauce from a jar mixed with canned enchilada sauce. There was absolutely nothing interesting about it, no dimension, no spices (not hot, I mean spices), nothing. And it tasted processed, as does the sauces from a can or jar.   The chile relleno was mournful, soggy, and flavorless. That is what my boyfriend got, I tried a bite, and that was it. Hell. No.  The tacos were good. Not great, just good. They don't make their own tortillas, and I don't particularly expect them to, but they were low quality and you could taste the dough conditioners and preservatives in them.  I didn't even bother to try the gordita, and I hope to never, ever, ever try the gordita, or anything else from this place ever again.  *****shudder*****"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is easy going. We were told it would be a 5 minute wait and we're sat in a timely manner.  The server was nice enough to give me a sample of the horchata (which is absolutely delicious). After this, she disappeared for about 10 minutes before taking our order. When the food arrived, my cousins order was wrong (she had asked for the dish without beans). We attempted several times to get our servers attention with no luck. My cousin ended up just eating around them (luckily they weren't mixed in the meal).  While we were eating, another server put her tray down on our table to deliver drinks to the table next to us. This is not only off-putting, but also unprofessional.  Food was fine, only standout was the horchata.  Needless to say, it wasn't good enough to make up for the service."}
{"text":"Always delicious and interesting food. Sometimes, my friends are really confused when they receive a taco with cilantro in it instead of cheese, beans and salsa -- all smothered with sour cream.  My favorite experience was the beef tongue tacos and the tripe tacos.  The tongue was incredibly soft and tasty and the the texture of the tripe was really unique and satisfying."}
{"text":"My family tried this the first time a few weeks ago for Menudo which was ok , kinda bland. My wife asked the chef or owner if they had good Tortas Ahogada and the man told her his are better than the ones you get in Guadalajara ! He also mentioned that they were going to start serving Pozole as well.  We were excited to return today April 14 to try these things ! Well unfortunately when my wife went to make an order to bring home,the young girl taking orders told my wife they didn't have Tortas Ahogada today and no Pozole!  This place just recently opened so shouldn't be out of anything! If your gonna brag to customers how great something is, you might want to actually HAVE IT! Good luck,we won't be back."}
{"text":"When people ask me what I would miss most about Madison, I always say Taqueria Guadalajara. Great authentic Mexican food and the portions for the price make this place a gem. The customer service is great and the people who work here take a lot of pride in this cozy space."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about Taqueria Guadalajara my boyfriend and I finally decided to go. It definitely did not disappoint, I would say it is by far the best Mexican food I have had in Madison. I got a pork sopes and a pork guardita. I liked the sopes better all around as the flavors were fresher (had lettuce and tomatoes). However the pork inside the guardita was to die for great flavor but very greasy. Not food I would eat on a regular basis but great to cure that Mexican craving."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a little bit \"weary\" of this place.  $2 tacos, good quality food? Seemed wayyyy too good to be true. NOPE! This place is AMAZING! Even my friend who generally doesn't like Mexican food, she enjoyed her food here!!! I came here with a group of friends and they first served us their unlimited chips and salsas. All of which tasted great, great flavors, good amount of spice, and unlimited!!! I ordered a Huarache with Intestine, and a pork stomach taco.  For $7, the huarache was definitely worth it. Piled high with veggies, and given a generous amount of GOOD QUALITY meat, I was absolutely satisfied, and super full.   The taco was great too, two corn tortillas with good quality toppings.  I was so happy with all the food I ate here, and surprised by the price and quality (in a good way of course).  I would DEFINITELY recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican food in Madison (though to be honest, there is very little decent Mexican good in this city). Usually I order delivery, though if you go to the small hole-in-the-wall restaurant, you'll be greeted by a very authentic experience; it appears to be run and frequented by Mexican-Americans. Just don't come looking for an upscale experience or a place with plenty of cocktail options or a nice wine list. The Burrito Mexicano is delicious and comes looking like a Mexican flag on a plate."}
{"text":"The rice and beans were some of the best I have ever had! I was quite disappointed though when I had limited options of meat for the chimichanga."}
{"text":"Heard great things about Taqueria Guadalajara and expectations were high.  The decor and such are quitey basic but you know that going in.  Staff were friendly and service wasn't slow, unlike other reviewers' experiences.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre (my husband used the words \"uninspired\" and \"somewhat bland\").  He had sopes and I had tacos.  Prices were quite reasonable, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is so clean! The staff was very friendly, and the owner(Jesus) is very proud of his food. I had to try 3 different tacos, and they were all delish! The tortillas were so soft, and believe me, they were loaded! Jesus was a chef at MGM grand, and it shows. The salsa bar has 6 different salsas in it. Everything seems pretty darn fresh! We are coming back..."}
{"text":"I completely fell in love with this place. It's hard to find good Mexican restaurants. They haven't been opened long and I've been to this place more than a few times. Their sopes are to die for. I've tried a few items on their menu and have never been disappointing. On top of their amazing food their customer services is very welcoming. I've never had to wait more than 15 mins for my food. I recommend their tacos and sopes of course! Go check this place out, they more than deserve the business."}
{"text":"My first meal upon arriving in Las Vegas. I found it on Yelp and am glad to say it lives up to the hype. Prices are very fair. Portions are large and the quality is incredible.WARNING: the jalapeno dip is delicious but not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"Delicious! Gave it a try last night after looking for a new place to eat and were not disappointed. Had the super quesadilla with carne asada and it was the best quesadilla I've had in some time. My husband had the al pastor super taco and carne asada taco and said both were great- but the al pastor was his favorite. We got an order of churros to share, too, and while being stuffed still manage to eat them all! They come filled with caramel and about 8 in total. We spoke to the owner who told us they'd been open 2 weeks and had 2 other stores in the Bay Area- hopefully more will open in Vegas soon!"}
{"text":"When walking into the restaurant, it seems as though it's an order-to-go kind of hole in the wall place, but our party of 9 had been reassured on the phone that there was space for us without a reservation. There is actually a dining room in the back, full of people on weekends while other guests ate at the small bar. Staff was super friendly and even though our whole party wasn't there, me and two other members of the group were seated in about 5 minutes. Speaking to those of us who could speak Spanish, we got to see even more of their personality and the love that goes into this establishment.  The menu is nothing short of emotional for a starving person around 7 pm, and we ordered the nachos while we waited. They were placed over refried beans, then topped with tomatoes, chicken, queso, and thick pieces of avocado. They were delicious and recommended. Do not be scared of the pictures on the menu, they do not tell lies.  They also had a great list of imported beers for about $3.5. I indulged in a sol while a couple other members of the party explored corona and modelo options. Two of my friends ordered the horchata and we're pleased to discover it was homemade. And tasty.   When the rest of our party arrived, we were quick to order. 7/9 of us ordered the enchiladas mole, but there were also enchiladas verdes and a chile relleno (stuffed pepper) present on the table. And lucky for me, I had ordered my boyfriend the pepper for us to share. No losses here.  When the first members of our party received their enchiladas mole, there were sighs of happiness. Two of our friends, who are Mexican, proclaimed the plate delicious. When we all finally got ours we were in agreement. The spices were just right and not overpowering, while it came out hot and accompanied by rice, a little salad, and beans.  The chile relleno was also fabulous. The pepper was quite large and cheese oozed freely when cut. The red sauce it came in complemented it well, and if you're scared of spice - don't worry.  We will be returning soon! There's so much more to try."}
{"text":"For those of you who fancy yourselves urban adventurers, if you find yourselves in the vicinity of 27th Ave. and Van Buren you could do a lot worse than Taqueria Guadalajara.  That may sound like damnation by faint praise, but it's really not.  What I mean to say is that at the end of the day I'd rather have a taco at Gallo Blanco, America's, or La Condesa.  But those places are playing in a whole other ballpark - hell, a whole other game - and they're catering to a whole other demographic than Taqueria Guadalajara is.  I first heard about this place at a \"taquiza\" first-birthday party that I attended in one of Phoenix's historic neighborhoods.  The kid's folks are lawyers, and I guess they wanted to bring a bit of authenticity to their Mexican-themed party (to compliment their custom-made robot shaped piñata - very authentic).  The Taqueria Guadalajara van was parked outside their house, and a very nice Mexican woman had set up a grill in the back yard and was making tacos to order - carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas - along with a full condiment bar.  It was pretty f'n cool.  I ate eight tacos, and was stuffed.  I thought the \"taquiza\" was a brilliant idea, took their card, and told my girlfriend and her family about it.  They thought it was a great idea too, and thought it might be good for an upcoming party they'll be having at their house.  I decided to do some due diligence before I gave that idea my blessing.    I checked Taqueria Guadalajara's license with Maricopa County's Environmental Services Department (I often do this with restaurants, and that's how I knew about True Food Kitchen's critical health code violations a while back).  Taqueria Guadalajara had no red flags on their report.  Today, my girlfriend, her mother, and I sojourned down Van Buren to check out the actual digs.  The place was very clean and easy on the eyes in every sort of way.  As my lady said: \"I shouldn't like these baby-poo colored walls, but I do.\"  Among the three of us, we ordered four tacos al pastor, four carne asada tacos, two carnitas tacos, a quesadilla, two Diet Cokes and an horchata, and our bill was $21.00.  All the tacos were savory.  Nothing really stood-out about them, but then again, nothing about them was bad.  The condiment bar was fully-stocked with the typical Mexican taco-goodies (salsas, pickled carrots, radishes, onions, etc.).  The food was ready quickly, and we were served with a smile.  Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.  As I said, I don't foresee myself making the trip to 27th Ave. and Van Buren for this stuff, but if you're in the neighborhood, you can stop by and expect a good experience.  If you're looking for someone to use for an authentic \"taquiza\" at your place, look no further."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small but the food makes up for that. Typically the owners/employees are nice. I wouldn't bring a large group of people."}
{"text":"Delicious mexican food...probably the best is Madison WI can't wait to eat here again ..."}
{"text":"Love the beer choices. Too bad there aren't margaritas. Staff are great, attentive enough to have your needs met. Quick enough for work lunch! Chips and salsa replenished a few times.  The place is small and cozy, windows along the back wall. I like the bright walls and flatware.  The food was excellent - rice, beans, burrito, tacos, steak, fried jalapeno, chips, two types of salsa, Modelos. I'll be back for sure; there are many more items on the menu I hope to try."}
{"text":"GORDITA GORDITA GORDITA  get it! Chicken gordita. This is SO good. Think a traditional taco, but fried tortilla. and a little \"fatter\".   Chicken taco - mexicano (cilantro + onion) - still a little bland (the chicken needs \"something\" in it).  Small space but they have 12 4-person tables. Bigger than expected. They have Jarritos and Victoria beer.   Free chips and salsa - the mild is mild and the spicy is medium. Both very GREAT flavors."}
{"text":"Seriously hands down taste that reminds me of when I lived in the southwest. Other places try.  This place gets it right. And with every bite I get a bit more nostalgic thinking of Arizona."}
{"text":"Had driven by this place a few times while visiting back in Madtown, looked pretty real and was on the right side of town so had to try. Yay! Real mexican, made & served by the same, and the place full of local hispanic families. Yes, it was hot & humid (Madison in August, right?) and my togo sat for 5mins before I got my ticket. The world didn't end with a 5min wait and the food was FANTASTIC! Lingua tacos, melt in your mouth good. Carne asada burrito, best since San Diego street food.  Realize your a gabacho, gringo, and get some darn fine mexi here!"}
{"text":"We were driving through and decided to stop after reading the reviews. The food is at a very decent price and the portions are very generous. You won't be disappointed! We had tacos, burritos and carne asada, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This place looks super small from the outside. It is still pretty small from inside too - probably could fit overall 25 - 30 people. The service was fairly slow but the food was good. It was really fresh. We got some colored chips and salsa. We also got some entrees which was good and we shared among 3 of us. 2 entrees were good enough."}
{"text":"This rating may have been higher if I'd went at a different time of the day. 3 stars because the food was amazing but the service was subpar.  The Positives  I love the building and it stands out. Looks like you're going into someone's house then boom, a whole entire restaurant. The dining room is very bright with its windows. You can tell that it's been renovated. It had a modern feel to it.  The food was amazing. My measure of a Mexican restaurant is how they do Enchiladas verdes. They hit way above the mark into orbit here. I demolished everything on that plate.   The Negatives  Understaffed: Their dining room was filled to capacity (each table was full) with only one server. This sucked/was awesome for her but our service was not what it could have been had they have anticipated our rush. It took at least 10 minutes for us to get started with water, chips, and salsa. We were barely able to get water refills in the course of meal.   They do not do tap fountain drinks. You can order beer or a soft drink in a can. That's it. I really hated that. That alone is a big deterrent from coming back.    All in all, if I knew the service were gonna be like that every time, I'd never come again. I'd recommend going when not many people are there for the best service. I liked it there--I just wish they had more than one server working at the time."}
{"text":"Born and raised in houston, tx to having to move to ft. Knox, KY. I had to be in ft. Mccoy, wi for a training event. Me and my partner were craving mexican food and decided since we were in the area of madison why not stop here. I must say this place hands down brought me back to my mexican roots. I have been craving some legit mexican food that not even kentucky can satisfy and this restaurant was just hands down the best. We had the enchiladas de mole one of chicken and the other of cheese and it was delicious. Reminded me of being back at my families in mexico. I was even surprised that they sold posole and menudo! Not that many mexican restaurants in Texas do that! When this restaurant says authentic mexican food they mean it. Even the restaurant reminded me of the ones in mexico. we really enjoyed ourselves and next year I will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They  have actual authentic ingredients that you won't find at a chain restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and allowed me to try a few things first before committing and they are so genuine. Truly will make the drive back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a business trip and was very happy to find all the positive reviews were right on. Nothing fancy, just good, simple Mexican food!  Prices were great and the Negra Modelo was nice and cold. If you're in the area, Taqueria Guadalajara is a great choice."}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place before, but have to again, they are that good!! Spent the weekend there and ate there twice.  Had the taco dinner with carne asada and pollo en mole.  Both delicious.  Very generous portions and cheap in comparison to other restaurants.  Salsa verde is very spicy and flavorful.  Love the horchata, can't find one that even comes close!   If you're in Madison, you gotta go.  They are voted the best in Madison, and you won't be disapppointed!"}
{"text":"Given that there are already over 200 reviews for this place, I doubt I will add anything of value. That being said I love this place and would like to support it's fantastic food and service in any fashion possible.  I've said it in other reviews, unfortunately there isn't a depth in diversity of dining in Madison. This is one place that helps solve this issue. Taqueria Guadalajara offers authentic Mexican food in a laid back atmosphere and with warm, friendly service.  As many reviewers have already elaborated, this place is packed at peak times. Luckily service is so fast that waiting doesn't exceed past twenty minutes per party.  When I do go here, I have a tendency to order the same thing over and over again, the steak chimichanga.  I see a lot of people order variety though, including a various assortment of foods with Verde sauce, breakfast, etc...   All food is made fresh and to order. This is a point of distinction between this taqueria and others in Madison. A clear example is that the steak is made for burritos, tacos, etc. in small batches to satisfy the orders needing steak. At other places, the steak will be made every few hours and will be allowed to sit around. This makes all the difference in taste of freshness and providing restaurant quality. The produce is also prepared in fresh as well every few hours. The tastes are very reflective of going to a classic place in Mexico and asking for a particular food.  The price, friendly staff, and great quality simply has no rival in Madison.  Oh and they also have Mexican cokes, horchata, Jarritos, and a few beers for selection - a nice touch."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. The horchata is the BEST around. Very good enchiladas, both with the verdes sauce and the mole sauce. My husband has gotten both the nachos (delicious pieces of steak and avocado!) and the chimichanga. Both HUGE. This place is a really good value. Very tasty chips and salsa as well. I have also ordered tamales to-go from here. They aren't on the regular menu, and you need to let them know in advance, but they are AMAZINGLY delicious. The place is pretty small but they do a good job moving things along. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love guad. Had a vegetarian huarache and some refried beans and rice and was just the happiest camper. I would say this is authentic, significantly better than any chain Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately I can see this becoming a weekly delivery order. (Side note: I've only ordered delivery and never actually been there.) (second side note: mild salsa is amazing and the guac is ever so spicy.)"}
{"text":"What a little hole in the wall gem on Park St.! I've heard a lot of buzz about this place in the past, but this is my first time. It's quant and authentic in decor; I like the mix of Badger memorabilia and vibrant yellow, pink, and teal Mexican color scheme.   I got the enchiladas mole with chicken. I don't think this mole had a chocolate base, but there were definitely notes of cinnamon that showed. Served with a side of beans and rice, this traditional dish was a big eat for only $7!   My dad got the Platillo Guadalajara, featuring steak, refried beans, pico de gallo, a grilled jalapeño (caution: very spicy!!), and a grilled cactus salad. I've never had cactus before, but it was tangy and tasted pickled...I liked it!   I would come back just for the complementary verde salsa and chips. It was a smoky flavor, and I couldn't stop eating it! Large portions, definitely a leftover kind of joint. Would be good to-go food too. Yum!"}
{"text":"I dined  here today for lunch. 5 stars for the food and 1 for the service. The  waitress was literally the rudest waitress I've ever had.  I've been here a few times and they've never been really friendly.  The younger waiter was better to the table next to me.  The only reason I left a decent tip  is because I'll be back for the carne asada tacos.  They need a serious personality boost."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Better quality and way more options than other Mexican restaurants in this area of old Henderson."}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch here a few times a month for about a year and have found this restaurant to be consistently good and the staff friendly.  I've tried only the tacos and my favorites are the carnitas and carne asada.  The dining room is always clean, parking is easy, and the prices are a great value."}
{"text":"Ate here in Sept while searching for the best Mexican food in Madison...the search stopped here, this has to be it!  Ordered takeout and the place was packed. While Sitting in the front waiting for my food, I was able to see the work the cooks put into their food. Everything was fresh and made to order.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla which was outstanding.  Moist fresh chicken with cheese, guacamole, lettuce salad and sour cream. Really was a meal in itself. My wife had chicken tacos which were very good according to her. I went with a beef Chimichanga.  While the flavor of the chimichanga was good, it was fairly greasy. Something of a guilty pleasure really and it is HUGE!  This was accompanied with chips and salsa that weren't bad either. Overall my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Pricing was good I thought for the quality you get. Will be a stop often for me on my drives North. Recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! Real authentic Mexican food. Definitely a good helping of meat and cheese in each item they have. I wish they had a little more selection on the menu but everything I have ordered is amazing. My favorite Mexican food stop in Madison for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions, great prices and all in all a great atmosphere! I'm really happy I was introduced to this place! Their pork enchiladas with green sauce and Horchata is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison last week to visit my niece, and we went here for dinner. I had a chicken mole, which was pretty good, especially the mole sauce, however was a bit disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because it was on the later side and our waiter was ready to leave for the night, but both my niece and I felt a bit rushed. If we were going to come back another time, I'd definitely come a little earlier. But as far as the food goes, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"On a recent visit we met a lovely couple who run the city's Spanish radio station and they recommended this restaurant.  My boyfriend, his son, and I had an incredible meal of pork and cheese tamales wrapped in corn husks, nachos, and burritos.  Just for the heck of it we tried AGUA FRESCA DE HORCHATA, a sweet rice drink that was surprisingly good, albeit in small doses.  Our entire meal cost an unbelievable $26! This was by far our favorite meal of our five state road trip!"}
{"text":"Taqueria Guadalajara is a small place bustling with people waiting to warm up with delicious Mexican food.   I had the Huarache Mexicano, and was blown away by the flavor. Guac was also on point.   It's a must visit if you're passing through Madison, and well priced too boot!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, one was to order, and the other to dine in. Both times I ended up getting chimichangas. The first time, I ordered the chicken chimi, and it was alright, the meat was pretty dry. But the second time when we dined in, I ordered the pork chimichanga and it was so flavorful and tender. We started off with complimentary chips and salsa and the salsa was really really good. Unfortunately they were served in single serve bowls and there were 4 of us eating so it wasn't enough. We also started off with some guacamole and that was pretty small too, it was super super good, but I don't know if it was worth the money to get that small of serving. Besides small servings of chips and salsa, the service wasn't that great either. Not a deal breaker but not that efficient. There was only 1 wait staff person for all 9-10 tables which made getting more water, chips & salsa, the bill, etc. a lengthy wait. I do wanna come back here and explore more of the menu"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is loved. They make their food with love. It's authentic alright. I still prefer Casa del Sol and Laredo's any day tho. The salsa is tasty but full of chunks and the really hot salsa is just that, reallllllllllly hot. Too hot to enjoy. But the chimichanga and the steak quesadilla were delicious. Juicy, shredded chicken, buttery quesadilla, great guacamole for only $2! Just watch out for bones in the chicken. I crunched into a large one. Almost made me lose my appetite. Food was too good to stop eating tho. I decided not to mention the bone because I just wanted to have a good time without any drama. I'm not afraid to mention it here tho, just as a warning to you all. Chew carefully and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Madison - and I have tried most of them.  The vegetarian tacos are delicious, and you can get the taco dinner (2 tacos, rice, and beans) for only two dollars. Their salsa is also delicious.  I will quickly become a regular here - I can't believe it took me so long to find this place!"}
{"text":"Well, let's see.  They completely screwed up the order, and when I called - as they speak no English - I politely did my best, in Spanish, to explain the issue.  After denying many times that yes, in fact, they had given the wrong order - SHE SIMPLY HUNG UP ON ME.  No, I will not be using them again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Highly recommend it! The carnitas are on point!  and the Carne Asada isn't far behind."}
{"text":"This is a \"5-star 1-star\" place. You know what I mean?  The food and decor really reminded me of real taco stands in Mexico. Cheap. Yummy. A breath of fresh air after all the terrible or pretentious Mexican food that I've eaten in Madison.  Real Mexican people eat here. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican joint in town! What are you waiting for? Cheap and tasty.  What's good? everything I've tried on the menu. I love pastor (pork) and Asada (beef) as the meats. They go fabulously with Tacos or Gorditas and the new Sopes! Horchata is the most authentic in town - thick and smooth and lots of cinnamon.  New fave bistec con Rajas y Queso - the beef is so good!!  I love this place. There are so many Mexicans visiting they have to be authentic! They just reopened a few weeks ago and it's really busy, but just go early/late on weekends or be prepared to wait a little."}
{"text":"Dam it, I picked another place for lunch which was very popular and a line waiting to get a table. We would wait about 25 minutes while watching how the well oiled staff handled the onslaught that was in full action.  The place is small with a bar area in the front and a small dining room in the back. The place had colorful fresh looking walls with open duct work on the ceiling. The tables and chairs are cheap cafeteria style placed in the room.  I was worried when I opened the menu and nothing it was more than $11 and change. I would have the taco dinner for a whopping $7 which was steak and pork with a Negra Mondelo.  The chips and salsa were complementary and filled at least twice while we were there. The salsa was standard but the green was the hot one with better flavor. The chips were commercial tri color but did do the job.  The tacos were very good I must say for $7. They were my kind, meat, cilantro and onions. The corn tortillas had great flavor and cooked perfect on the flat top grill, just in the middle of soft to hard with flexibility left in them. The steak was flavorful and slightly seasoned. The pastor was melt in your mouth tender, i sampled the meats before I put the salsa on them and ate them. The beans were thick and lumpy with onions in them which I liked. The rice as usual does nothing for me. Not one mystery gristle or fat chunks in the meat so they trim the meat well.  Over all for price vs quality this is a solid joint. The tacos were very good and I can see why people wait in line for the place. We had to wait in line to pay on my way out so line in and line out. For price vs quality vs value there cant possibly be anything better and my only problem was no margarita on the menu to complete the whole experience. I wish this was in my neighborhood because I don't anything even close but I'm glad I we stopped by."}
{"text":"I travel to Madison frequently for work, and I was delighted to find a good Mexican restaurant that wasn't all about overly sweet margaritas or bland enchiladas.  I can say without any doubt that the food I ate here does not lack taste!  The atmosphere is modest but certainly not objectionable, and the service was just fine.  My companion and I ordered deep-fried jalapeños, which were a surprise, and cactus salad, as appetizers.  Quite good.  I had a lovely pork dish in a tomatillo sauce--can't remember the name, but found the pork seasoned well and the sauce quite tasty.    Our only complaint was that the prices were so low--my dining companion couldn't possibly meet her travel per diem that day!  OK, I would also have enjoyed a full-service bar, but the selection of Mexican beers was good."}
{"text":"wow, this place is no joke.  as authentic (by california standards) of a taqueria i've seen outside the west coast."}
{"text":"If you are craving good, authentic Mexican food in Madison then this is your place. My husband and I came here because we saw all the great reviews it received, and it did not disappoint!   I ordered the \"enchiladas de mole\", which was incredible. The mole sauce had a wonderful flavor, with the perfect level of heat. I ordered my enchiladas with chicken, which ended up being a great choice. I am usually pretty picky when it comes to meat in enchiladas or tacos (not a big fan of finding bone or gristle...but who is?) and this shredded chicken was perfect. Their guacamole is also delicious, I highly suggest it.  The prices here are amazing as well. For dinner on a Saturday night, for both me and my husband (plus an appetizer & 2 cokes) our bill came to under $30.   Great place overall, we will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Doing a cross country road trip means you get to utilize yelp to its fullest potential and this is a prime example of why I'm a true believer of Yelp.   I found Taqueria Guadalajara while rolling through Madison on my road trip back to the West Coast when my partner in crime and I were craving for some good Mexican food.   Yeah this place doesn't look like much from the outside. In fact, this is probably the epitome of what one would term, \"hole in the wall.\" But this hole in the wall will definitely shut your pie hole once you have a taste of their food. Go ahead, let them blow your mind, you'll really enjoy it. I did, and would do it again if I'm ever back in WI."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food authentically prepared. Speedy service. As Yogi Berra famously said, \" Nobody goes there anymore; they're too busy.\" Best enjoyed for a late lunch or early dinner. (FYI: clean rest room.)"}
{"text":"It was good... possibly great.  Coming from San Diego, it's hard to satisfy my taste, but this place is authentic, especially considering we're in the midwest.  I only had the street tacos, which were great, and yes, you can definitely mess up a dish that only consists of 4 ingredients. It's fast, you get chips and they serve up coke in a bottle.     I'll definitely be back to try out the other dishes; although, there really is no reason to stray away from good tacos."}
{"text":"The best authentic steak tacos in Madison! They rarely disappoint and are consistently good!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Madison. All but one of the servers I've had there have been really friendly, the food is great & a fantastic value. The potato gorditas are like little pitas fried in a pan & stuffed with seasoned potatoes and refried beans and they're great. I also love the torta with carne al pastor. Great place."}
{"text":"In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave \"don't believe the hype.\"  For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the \"best Mexican restaurant in Madison\" and other people call it the \"absolute best Mexican food period.\"   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.  I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.  FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.  SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!  THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.  So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"JUST GO HERE. Go with friends. Get one of everything. This place feels like a true taco shop, just like the places I went to in Mexico. The staff was delightful and so helpful. They have a SALSA bar with lots of delicious salsas. The diablo shrimp plate is sensational and \"muy picosa\" which means actually spicy, and an excellent flavor. A \"side\" of guacamole is huge, absolutely worth it. All the tacos we had were delicious and a great size. ABSOLUTELY worth a visit, one of the best authentic taco places I've been to in the states."}
{"text":"Delicious food every. Time. Food has always tasted fresh, and is prepared fairly quickly. Decent prices. Authentic. Staff is friendly. I recommend this place to all my friends. Very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday.  Parking is not very good, all street parking.  I was expecting \"authentic\" Mexican food.  Immediately I was disappointed.  The chips appeared to be mass produced multi-color chips.  Not warm or anything special.  The food was bland.  I had the steak chimichanga and there was no heat or much flavor.  I doused it in salsa to give it some flavor.  The other meal we got was the same with no flavor.  The service was great, that's the best I can say.  I will not be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Giant and I mean giant portions. Everyone friendly and food is awesome. We ordered two burritos and a super nachos, the three of us ate the nachos only and had to take the burritos home for later. We will be coming back! Great prices and food."}
{"text":"I had horchata, beef tongue taco and pork stomach gordita for $7.4! the price is just amazing. And this is the only place in Madison I know where I can have pork stomach or beef tongue, they are yummy! the horchata is a little too sweet, and the waitress seems not very friendly to Asian, but I'll come back here later, for food!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and I love this restaurant. If you are a Mexican food lover like myself, and hate shitty yellow cheese nachos or lettuce/tomatoes with your tacos, this is your place. Onions, cilantro, lime, and pastor is the way to go. They even have cactus and 2 great salsas. Insanely cheap as well."}
{"text":"Meh. Decent food, building and environment was alright, our waitstaff seemed mediocre.  Nothing really exciting..."}
{"text":"Why isn't there 10 stars?     GREAT food.  Authentic.    The food is priced for an average budget !   Clean,  fast service.  friendly.     We go at least once a week --"}
{"text":"5 stars for the chimichanga alone. HUGE portions (woohoo leftovers for lunch tomorrow) It's your basic Mexican restaurant décor. The food is served fast and the margaritas are to die for. Only regret I didn't order fried ice cream"}
{"text":"My favorite a la carte Mexican restaurant in Madison is back, with a fresh new coat of paint and the same familiar vibe. My favorite dish went up in price and was renamed to Platillo Guadalajara, but it's still the same fatty thin-sliced steak with crispy ends goodness. I like to eat half the plate with corn tortillas and pack the rest away for tomorrow's lunch.   It can be fun to watch the kitchen bustle at the counter seats, but you'll definitely leave smelling like tortillas and onions. The spacious room in the back is usually filled with couples and families during lunch on the weekends. Taqueria Guadalajara is on its way to becoming a Madisonian institution."}
{"text":"Great carne asada burrito. Awesome chips and salsa. Everything very authentic."}
{"text":"Is it me or is Taqueria Guadalajara fun to say? It's easy to ride past this restaurant and say to yourself, \"I wonder what that place is about?\" or maybe not even notice it.  When you walk in, you know it's going to be good.  They bring pico, salsas and fresh limes out pronto. You get hot salsa without having to ask, that is a gold estrella from me.  Comfort food and great service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison. It is a tiny space and I'm so glad they expanded out the back part of the restaurant. The only down side, if you go during the summer, you may need to bring a jacket, they REALLY blast the A/C in the back area. But enough about that. During peak hours, they do get really busy and there may be a short wait. Parking could be an issue too, but nothing that should deter you from going.  Their food is fantastic. The tacos come with just onions, cilantro and lime and a choice of meats. Their sopes are homemade, and are delicious. I also love the tamales there. I prefer the green tamales over the red, but honestly, they are both great. I also love their pork tenderloin in tomatillo sauce, it's spicy and tangy and is so good! Their salsa is homemade, the mild is so good. and the hot one is really smokey and really hot! Pretty much everything there is great.   If you call for take out, your stuff is ready in less than 10 minutes, so get in your car as soon as you hang up the phone. The tortillas do get a little soggy once they get packed for a to go order."}
{"text":"Damn good food. Not greasy. Nor over spiced. Simple. The service was chaotic but the food more than made up for it. I would def recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite mexican restuarant in Madison.   I can't speak highly enough of the staff or food.   My favorite is the the chile relleno.   Their flan has a smooth consistency that is often missing from that desert.   On top of that the small items- tacoes, at are great a great deal.  They don't serve tex-mex so don't go in expecting taco bell.  :)"}
{"text":"Our group of six recently tried Taqueria Guadalajara for dinner. We arrived around 7 on a Wednesday evening. The place was crowded but they were able to seat us in about 15 minutes.   The menu was filled with dishes which aren't on every other Tex Mex menu. Between unusual meats like tongue, stomach, and intestines, they offered huaraches: oblong masa base, covered with refried beans, choice of meat, green salsa and melted cheese; sopes: deep fried thick tortillas with raised edges, topped with beans and your choice of meat; and gorditas: deep fried pockets of corn meal dough filled with your choice of meat cooked in a green sauce. It was a pleasure to see some non-ubiquitous dishes.  The chips came in the colors of the Mexican flag and were served with a fresh flavorful salsa. I had the enchiladas verdes. The rice and beans were just the right texture and the sauce was amazing. I practically licked the plate clean. One of my friends had the huaraches and she said she would be willing to eat that everyday for a week, it was so good. Everyone enjoyed their food and thought the flavors and textures were spot-on."}
{"text":"Move aside, Chipotle, because I've found my new go-to Mexican place in Madison!  After a day of tailgating, my friends and I desperately needed some food in us. Then along came Taqueria Guadalajara (aka I used Yelp). Between four people, we placed an order of their Platillo Guadalajara, the taco dinner (two tacos with meat of your choice, refried beans and rice), the chicken quesadilla and their Huarache Vegetariano.   25 minutes later, our food was ready, packed and good to go. They also included a variety of sauces (the spicy one was absolutely delicious), some guacamole and chips. All for $35 post tip!  It was tempting not to eat all the food then and there, as the scent of comfort Mexican food wafted through the air. The moment I arrived home, we immediately tore into the food like fiends, and devoured every last piece within minutes. It was a sickening sight to behold, but oh, was it delicious.   The Platillo Guadalajara was definitely the standout, but everything else held their own as well.   My stomach actually just rumbled while writing this review. I think it's time to grab some food."}
{"text":"Great pork tamales, and if you haven't yet, try the huaraches. Seating is good for couples and small 4-6 groups. It's definitely a lot quieter and quicker service around 8:30/9pm past the dinner rush. But service in general is good.  My only reservation is that TWICE now I've found hairs (embedded/baked in) inside my pork tamales. This is over several visits so it's not a very common occurrence. But 2 times is probably 2 too many.  My rating is a testament to the food quality aside from the occasional hair. Worth a try for more genuine Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican food I have had in the year that I've lived in Las Vegas! Quesadilla was stuffed FULL of cheese! Al pastor that melts in your mouth.  Highly recommended and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best taqueria in Madison for sure.  Doesn't hold a candle to East- or West-Coast Mexican food, but it's very solid."}
{"text":"I guess I went to a different restaurant than everyone else because Taqueria Guadalajara had nothing great going for them! It is small and loud to start with, but that is easy to get over in exchange for banging food.  We had six of us dining and we all ordered something different.  We were all very disappointed as the food was bland and just not very good.  The service wasn't great either as half of the table received their food quite a while before the other half.  I have to say after reading the reviews, I was excited to try this place and hopefully find a decent place for Mexican food in Madison..I guess I will keep looking..."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, and I would happily give 5 stars... But it is distractingly dirty. :( The menus, floors, walls, tables... all need a decent cleaning. But I enjoyed the food! I got the huarache done vegan. Delicious."}
{"text":"The entire evening every table was full. The food was fresh and the open kitchen was very clean. They had very good service, despite only having one waitress. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Lets just say that this place has the best Mexican in Madison."}
{"text":"Went here in hopes of having a good pozole rojo, but it was a Tuesday and they only make pozole during the weekend. Instead I was torn between the flauta dinner and the enchiladas verdes. I asked the server which she preferred and she actually offered to serve me a plate with one flauta and one enchailada just so that I could enjoy both! Super attentive and really knew how to please the customer. She also refilled my chips and salsa which were great for snacking. I really enjoyed the chile verde on the enchilada and overall the dish was very good. I also ordered their champurrado which was delicious and perfect for a cold winter day. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after hearing nothing but good reviews from friends. There was chicken in our \"vegetarian\" tacos, and the quality of the food in general was sysco-tastic (read: no nutrients or taste). Both my girlfriend and I felt ill immediately after eating half our meals. We won't be going back again, ever."}
{"text":"If this is the \"best mexican in madison,\" then I'll not be eating much mexican. It is authentic, but there were bones in my chicken taco, which was somewhat bland besides that. I also ordered a torta and a pork taco. The pork taco had flavor, but the torta was light on meat and felt like a mouthful of bread. I didn't finish my meal, which is very unusual for me.  Edit: Adding a second star upon visiting the place in person. Good atmosphere, and the vegetarian dishes are solid. Just don't get the meat, basically."}
{"text":"Taqueria Guadalajara re-opened August 8 after re-modeling due to extensive fire damage.  The layout is the same but everything is new and clean so the place does not have quite the same hole-in-the- wall feel.  It was packed with a diverse clientele and many families out for Sunday dinner.  Service was friendly though slow.  The food was very tasty and portions were ample. My husband had chicken quesadillas, my son chicken tacos and I had the pozole, available on weekends only, and we all enjoyed our dishes.  The noise level is high and tables along the side wall are cramped but overall it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I went here on a suggestion and was not disappointed. Low prices, fast services, huge portions and tasty. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"I have these as the best tacos in the country (and I've eaten the top-rated tacos in Chicago, and Phoenix). I went here on the Yelp reviews a year back, and have been going back whenever passing through Madison craving tacos. The bar seating and liquor license give it extra points, and the location is actually a plus (some say not-so-nice area, I say plenty of parking). Yes, bizarre that these are some of the best tacos are in the country, but that's just the way it is."}
{"text":"Tasty traditional Mexican food in the heart of Wisconsin? Check. The price is so right and the service has always been prompt and friendly. Tacos, enchiladas, huaraches, horchata, tamales... You can't go wrong.   Taqueria Guadalajara is one of those trusty no-fuss joints you can hit up any day of the week. Don't forget about their weekend brunch menu that features various egg dishes and soup specials.   Also, bring cash, as they are trying to avoid charging customers by credit card."}
{"text":"Pork huarache had great flavor but was a bit fatty and gristly.  I preferred the chicken, sadly.  Extremely fast service.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite shop and home it's here to stay! We've been to the surrounding taco shops: Santa Rosa, Taco Bell, Cueva Market and taco shop on Boulder, and Sonrisa Mexican restaurant at Lake Las Vegas. This shop beats all of them by a mile. Everything is fresh. Portions are big. Prices are appropriate. Staff is nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison. Very clean atmosphere and friendly staff! I recommend the Tortas!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  The smell of freshly cooked tortillas was wonderful.  The staff was nice, and the food was amazing.  I highly recommend it.  It's a \"hole in the wall\", but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"This restaurant is bomb! I got a chicken burrito and it was perfect. Add in a Modelo and it was the perfect meal. I've had their food several times now and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing portions enough for two. Best Mexican food in Madison. Service is extremely friendly and quick. Would highly recommend to any one looking for authentic Mexican food and flavor. Parking was a little hard to come by but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Tons of flavor, HUGE portions,  super clean restaurant, and fantastic service (special thanks to the cashier - Selene and to the chef - Jesus). The surf and turf burrito, the super nachos,  and the habenero mango salsa is by far the favorites amongst my family. WE WILL BE BACK SOON!!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time going to Taqueria Guadalajara, and the food was so good it reminded me of back home in California, I will be coming back again, and the service was so good and everyone was so nice. Thanks everyone at Taqueria Guadalajara. Carrie"}
{"text":"Okay okay okay..... I went back to this place with a friend... I was reluctant at first but meh I said what the hell.... I will try it again... We actually ate inside of the restaurant we where seated quickly we ordered extra chips and salsa but I think our waiter had forgotten... We asked him like three times... My friend and I chatted it up so we weren't to worried about it... I had flautas the chicken ones yummy next time I think I will ask for the dressings on the side they got really soggy... But they were really good so this place isn't that bad... It's okay"}
{"text":"This place has been well described by others so I will just say that it is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Pork tacos + some real sugar Coke and some great genuinely hot salsa = happy happy.  My Wife loves the tortas and the food is cheap, fast and delicious.  The only down side for me was that the in-room kitchen put off a bit of grease in the air and during the winter and the place is pretty closed so I had an asthma flare up from breathing the smoke and ended up wheezing my way through my tacos.  But I suppose if they had good ventilation the place would not be the quaint, authentic inexpensive gem that it is."}
{"text":"Wow, is this place great! I was a little apprehensive when my boyfriend showed me his favorite Mexican joint in Madison--it definately looks like a dive.  But he loves food and so do I, plus I read all of the previous reviews, and gave it a shot. Walking in was a bit... icky? It is not the cleanest or nicest place-at all, but we were greeted by smiling faces.  Space is limited here and we sat at the \"bar\" which is really where the cooking is going on, which is nice because you can watch them prepare your food.  I got 2 vegetarian tacos and a potato chalupa. Oh, and a tangerine Jarritos!  Oh my goodness, it was all so great and SO cheap.  The tacos are $1.75 each and chalupa $2.50 (I think).  My boyfriend got chicken enchiladas which he had never had and loved as well Plus, the chips and salsa werer really good (minus the fact that they were replenished by a gloveless boy :/).  If you can get over the clean factor, this place is amazing.  4 stars b/c of the no glove thing, but the food is super good and very fast.  I will definately come here if I want fast Mexican instead of taco bell lol.    AND my bf said they have outdoor seating in the summer! Yay!"}
{"text":"This is a family-owned, family run business that makes a variety of flavorful Mexican food.  They are reliable, friendly, and quick.  I consider this the best Mexican food  in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant twice; I had the dos fish tacos and the super shrimp burrito. Both are excellent. They have an amazing selection of salsas. Nice clean restaurant with friendly staff. The menu has something for everyone in the family. I cannot wait to visit again and try another menu item."}
{"text":"This is generally a really good spot for some Mexican food. The only reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is because there have been a few times where the food has not been as good. I mostly chalk this up to off days as for the most part it is delicious. I also think I usually have better luck with steak dishes as opposed to chicken ones. For the weekend, they have a delicious menudo and breakfast options (all day I think?).  The restaurant is often packed but we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes. Service is fast and efficient with unlimited chips and salsa. Prices are also very affordable."}
{"text":"Today I ordered a take-out vegetarian burrito from the Taqueria Guadelajara in order to check out the generally laudatory appraisals of previous patrons.  Unhappily, I could not concur with the consensus.  While the burrito was tasty, it couldn't be customized.  That is to say, there was ONE burrito on offer, whose ingredients were mandatory.  This contrasts with other taquerias of my experience which offer dozens of options.  In addition, it was expensive (comparatively).  While the menu listed burritos at $6 each, I was charged $8 (because it was VEGETARIAN?)  Since the most expensive ingredient in a burrito is the MEAT, why does Taqueria Guadelajara charge a 34% premium for a burrito that EXCLUDES it?  In short, the Taqueria Guadelajara burrito was OK, but neither so toothsome nor such a good value as to merit a return.  (Full disclosure:  I'm not a native, so perhaps this is the best that can be had this far north.  I will continue to search.)"}
{"text":"I had the enchiladas de mole with chicken, and they were delicious. My boyfriend had some kind of burrito that he also liked. The service leaves a bit to be desired, but the food is top notch. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food that is hard to find in Vegas best one I have found and it's not expensive !"}
{"text":"I live six blocks away, but its natty exterior scared me off. The other day, I scoped Mexican restaurants and this came very highly rated.   As we walked in (with my 11-year-old), it was clean and rustic (another word for an outdated and sparse sh*thole). The clientele combined many Hispanics casually speaking Spanish (big plus) and face-filled Caucasians. Within 10 seconds of seating, we had a bowlful of chips and fresh mild / hot salsa and very pleasant greeting from the server.      Opening the menu, they filled the pages with Mexican perfection. We're a little adventurous (me more so than my 11-year-old) and was excited by the menu items of tripe, tongue and cactus. OMG, right!?!?! Those items are only found in a Taco Bell entree by freak accident.   Don't worry, there are many conventional items as well.   Chowing on chips, we slugged a couple of Jarrito sodas (I had tamarind and he had lime). Before 10 minutes passed, our burritos came. He had beef and I had seasoned pork steak (carne el pastor). While digging in mine, I had to nibble on his too. Both were incredible; the meat was tender and delicious and included sides were refried beans (perfectly seasoned, cooked and homemade) and delicious rice (slightly smoked and cooked to perfection). We were in such delight, I do not know we recalled breathing.  To go, we picked a beef tongue taco (he would not promise to resist French-kissing the taco); Platillo Guadalajara (special with steak, chile and cactus); chimichanga (MASSIVE); tamale dinne and  two Cokes (glass bottle) for UNDER $50!   Before I typed this up, I sampled the plates and the food is consistent. All the food is homemade, filling and perfectly textured/seasoned.   I feel like such and idiot for holding out on this joint."}
{"text":"After seeing the 4 star rating and reading the rave reviews about this place I was really excited to try it out but my experience was an utter disappointment. My wife and I had the carne asada tacos and the huarache. The carne asada in the tacos was bland, it didn't have any flavor at all. The huarache tasted a little bit better than the tacos, the carne asada in it had a bit of flavor and the melted cheese and guacamole helped a lot. I think there are much better authentic Mexican restaurants in Madison but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Moved here from Southern California where there is absolutely no shortage of amazing Mexican food. THIS is Mexican food done right. The service was also exceptional. Overall, this place wins - hands down - best in Madison."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the outside. This place was initially just a kitchen for a catering business but then they decided to make it a restaurant too(hence the location and outside look). Tacos are very authentic to what you get in El D.F(Mexico City). They actually have Suadero, no other place in Arizona sells it. The pastor was extremely good, best in Arizona. The Asada has some fat but not much. They have a big salsa bar and you put the ingredients you want. They have some tacos for $.99 i think chicken was one of them. Definately a go to for authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"If you want to eat REAL Mexican food, visit Taqueria Guadalajara. It's a tiny space with an open kitchen. Sit at the front counter if you can, so you can enjoy the full cultural experience.   We've visited several times, but I'll focus on my most recent visit. It was Saturday lunch. We arrived just prior to 11:30, after having been to indoor cycling class earlier that morning, so we were starving for an early lunch. Good thing we arrived when we did, as the place was completely packed 10 minutes after we arrived.  I ordered the huarache el Paisano, which is refried beans, a piece of grilled cactus, fried onions, green salsa, melted cheese and topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado and sour cream. It's an entire platter of food for only $7. The steak version of this dish is also $7, so they keep the prices very reasonable.  Service was super friendly and fast. I also enjoyed a Mexican Coca-Cola.  Do yourself a favor and visit this authentic Mexican restaurant on Park St."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer in this establishment since 2009. It is unfortunate that it has closed down because of a fire a while ago, but yes, it came back and the quality is still as good as before. Although the price went up a little bit after it reopened, the decor and ambiance has improved by many levels. The service is usually pretty fast.   We had huarache and three tacos. Yummy. This is one of the best affordable, fast, yet delicious places for a budget foodie like me.   By the way, I don't know if other Mexican restaurant in town serve the soup \"menudo\" or not, but they do! The portion is huge. I suggest sharing it with a group of people, otherwise you may end up not able to finish it like us."}
{"text":"This review is for people like me, who see the great reviews and want to try it out. I buy that it is authentic and I buy that the food is ok, but it also seems to be overinflated due to some bandwagon hype.  Obviously, this is only one experience, but I went with my wife on one of the first nice Saturday afternoons of the spring. When we arrived, it was absolutely packed and some people were just milling around outside. I poked my head inside to find a small room with the dingy \"kitchen\" right there surrounded by bar-style seating. I say \"kitchen\" because there were at least two microwaves going at all times.   Maybe things are different when it isn't crammed full of people, but I had no idea whether to sit, wait, walk through to the back (where there is apparently more seating) or try to give a take-out order. We were eventually offered a seat by the waitress and placed our order. I got a steak torta...I don't recall what my wife had because they brought the wrong thing out at first. I have no idea how they could have kept track of the orders with all the people there. I will say this, the tortra was huge and the food came out fast...so fast that I almost suspect is was someone else's order that also had a torta, since my wife's plate was incorrect. When we were done, neither of us were overwhelmed by the food.  So, first timers, just be aware of what you may be walking into. Based on the majority of the reviews, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! We catered from them too and they delivered great food for our party."}
{"text":"After the review in the local newspaper and rave reviews online for this restaurant my husband and I tried this restaurant over the weekend. My husband liked it more than I did. He would go back, I wouldn't eat at this restaurant again. Service was slow and the waiter barely spoke to us. The chips placed on our table when we arrived came right out of a Frito Lay bag, were cold and the basket was only half full - no seconds on chips until you ask for them. We were sat at a small table for two against the wall facing the bathroom doors when there few patrons in the restaurant and tables for 4 were available with views out the large windows to the back of the property. The food was only so-so with no garnish on the plate. I've had better take-out food. Prices were cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.  La Hacienda is just a few blocks north, go there and you'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"The food is good, and fresh.   I have been there many times and have no complaints.  This place is also not anything at all flashy but still feels like home and is super cute. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Guadalajara is an authentic taqueria. Their food does not arrive covered in sour cream and cheese and that is fine with me. Food is overall very good but can be inconsistent at times. Not much to look at on the inside with wooden booths that aren't the most comfortable.   When this place is good - as was my last visit - it is four stars. However sometimes the meat is overcooked; this is where the inconsistency comes in. The carne asada is cut a bit too thin; the steak ranchero can come out a bit dry. But when everything comes out right it is fabulous!  What brings me back time and time again is the side order you can get of roasted onions and jalapenos. For $2 you can get a plate of six large jalapenos or 7 large scallions that have been grilled; they will transform anything rolled in a tortilla to be absolutely delicious. Ordered taco's a la carte since I can't stand a plate loaded up with carbs.  One carne asada which was $2.50, one al pastor which was $1.50 and one barbacua which was $1.50.  Served simply with a bowl of cilantro and a bowl of chopped onions. Topped with their various salsas and grilled veggies it was a tasty meal.    New this visit was a menu of fruit pulps; kind of an exotic shake. There are several kinds from the usual - mango, papaya, blackberry - and the unusual - passionfruit, soursop, tamarand. The descriptions mentioned the health benefits of each fruit, like good for kidneys, antioxidant, intestinal transit, and others which were pretty amusing to read. They had a shake made from Lulo;  some kind of citrus fruit I had never heard of before, so of course I had to try it. It was sweet and tasty, would definitely come back for some of the others."}
{"text":"Take out, delivery or dine in. Yummy 2$ tacos with add on options like avocado cheese and grilled onions. I've had steak and chicken which come with cilantro and onions. I wish they offered fish tacos as well. They make their gorditas in house. Offer two homemade salsas with their chip baskets- a mild and spicy one that is very unique. Offers authenticity at a great value."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for my wife's dissertation defense and it hit the spot!   We ordered 10 chicken flautas, 10 tacos dorados, and 10 tacos (beef n chicken) plus some chips n guacamole. They were prepared with care and hot. The sides were individually packed. And the chili and quac tasted just like grandma used to make.   While they don't have a catering menu - they are definitely worth ordering from for your next party!  When I went to pick up the order I was surprised to see that they totally remodeled and the back of the restaurant was bigger!   We will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"I'm ok with this place. I've actually only gone here a couple times after the rebuild after the fire damage. The food is quite good ranging from average to above average. It's light years ahead of some of the guck I had earlier from Fuzzy's Taco Shop yet I can't say I'd drive here over similar neighborhood tastes like El Pastor or La Hacienda. The reason this place won't get stars higher with me is honestly trhe seating and noise. It feels like I'm in some kind of lunch room in High School all over again when there are more people there. Everyone seems friendly and the servers are friendly but its strange for me to have a meal with people at my elbows that I don't know. The other issue I've come across there is cleanliness ranging from strange things floating in the water to finding a rubber band in the salsa.. It looked like something to just tie jalapenos or tomatos-not a hair band..but still.. I'm sure curiosity will drive me back here again in the future or will venture into a delivery option sometime again."}
{"text":"Very good, very authentic dishes! Great portion sizes. Berry margarita was so yummy and thirst quenching. Large, open dining area with a lot of seating. Large sectioned off room great for parties. Only disappointment was the flan. It was not as creamy as others. Just a strange consistency. Very gel like. Bland, too. Otherwise, it's a favorite place of ours!"}
{"text":"You won't get gourmet Mexican food here, but you will get pull-up-a-bar-stool-and-slab-some-salsa-on-your-taco authenticity. This small place is hard to find, but the tacos and burritos are great, and you'll likely be shouldering up against some Spanish-speakers. The owners are super friendly and will make you feel like you are being served by your long-lost Mexican abuela (grandma)."}
{"text":"I went for lunch a couple of weeks ago and I was quite happy with what I got.  I had their special pork burrito with a coke. As soon as you sit they serve some tortilla chips with salsa and try to not get too full with those. Portions are good and food is tasty and definitely not light. The prices are really low for what you get so I'm pretty happy with it.  I've only tried one dish, so for now I don't have much to add. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"Was a really good experience, has authentic Mexican Food,  so delicious,  definitely going back soon, really recomendable"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in LOVE with this place!! Staff is SUPER nice and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food, this place is where you need to be. Reasonably priced food, menu full of options, and food comes to table fast. The only downfall to Taqueria Guadalajara is their size. They are a little small for a place thats so consistently busy."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Madison by a very, very long shot!    This is not the sort of place you go for the ambiance.  It's teeny, cramped, and hot, and loudish cheesy music videos were blaring from a television.  But honestly, who the heck cares when you're eating food this good?  Admittedly, my first dining experience (two or three years ago) at Taqueria Guadalajara was sort of meh -- I had the Burrito Mexicano (the one that looks like a Mexican flag!) and it was just okay.  But my second meal was so delicious that I'm thinking that the first must've been an off evening or something (for me or for them).  I had the chicken tacos, and even though it was just seasoned chicken and lettuce in a corn tortilla, it was absolutely delicious.  No dry chicken here, no sir.  My boyfriend got a pork taco (super freaking good -- I'll be getting this when I go back), a tongue taco (also very good but I personally can't get over the whole I'm-eating-something's-tongue thing) and a vegetarian sope which was just fried heaven.  I do wish they had soda from a fountain rather than in cans, but really, a minor complaint.  All that yum for $13.50?  You'd better believe I'll be back.  Soon.  And often."}
{"text":"Best deal in Madison. The enchiladas were fantastic. The price was below market. Can't go wrong here. If you like Mexican food check it out."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in the USA The price is right. I go for the steak tacos and the magnificent menudo. ( only on Sat. Sun) A friendly staff greets you."}
{"text":"For the price, the place way over performed. I'll be going back. Great selection of authentic food, made fresh, nothing processed, with local Hispanic community taking up many of the tables. Don't let the unassuming front throw you off...great food."}
{"text":"What is this  is what I should ask. The menu is full of nouns that are new to me.  I was not to hungry so I went with a puro queso quesadilla. it was good came beans and a few chips and even a nice garnish.   My co worker loved his carne asada burrito. And we both love the chips hot sauce and guac sauce here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison by far! Food is always top notch (try the chimichanga, you won't regret it). Great atmosphere if your eating in. Staff is always very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow ...this small hole in the wall is wonderful  from the servive and  love the food totally authentic Mexican food. Awesome salsa,tortas,enchiladas, amd the flan was so good. I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best authentic mexican restaurants in Madison. You have to park on the street and the place is smaller so I recommend going on an \"off\" time.  The food is fresh and delicious but more importantly the  flan is the BEST I've ever had.  Great customer service too."}
{"text":"Certainly the best Mexican place in Madison, if not all of Wisconsin. The restaurant is shabby and it's not in the nicest area, but the food makes everything worth it. The mole sauce is the best I've ever come across. Everything - from the chips to the veggies - was incredibly tasty and fresh.   Don't expect a lake view or 5 star service, but if you're looking for a Mexican experience, this is the place for it. The portions are huuge and the prices are great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally some real Mexican food in Henderson! Authentic traditions of flavors here.  My family ordered tacos de lengua, tacos de res, enchiladas y ceviche. All were really good, and I'm super picky when it comes to Mexican food because I like the real deal.  They don't mess around when it comes to the salsa bar either, make sure you order a drink so that you can calm the spicy-ness on your tongue.  Hands down great food! We'll be back and are glad Henderson finally has a place like this we can come to regularly - it's about time!"}
{"text":"This place is everything that has been described. Small, authentic, shabby looking, iffy service.  It was a little hard to find parking, but I guess that is not an uncommon problem in Madison. They advertise they serve mixed drinks but they don't. They don't even have margaritas.   I got the Mexican Burrito and a veggie taco. The burrito was kinda bland, possibly would have tasted better with meat in it but I was less than impressed. The veggie taco was much tastier and wished I had gone that route instead.  It was also kinda hot in there but I guess air conditioning isn't common in Madison since it stays cold most of the year. I may consider going back there again but I wasn't completely sold."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if decor is important to you.  After walking through the kitchen to get to the tables with mismatched chairs in the back, my BF and I suspected we were in for some tasty food and we were not disappointed!   I had a huarche al pastor- sort of an open faced burrito with pork and he had the enchiladas verde.  Both of us completely cleaned our plates, and even with a generous tip the total was at least half of what we might spend at a nicer place with lesser quality food. We will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be really great for some fast food, staff was friendly but a little slow. The cook took my order since the lady at the register was being a little slow entering the orders from the guests in front of me which I appreciated because it was a to go order and I was on my lunch break.   I got a carnitas burrito bowl and the meat was a little dry so next time I'll try something else but I do appreciate you can get the burritos as a bowl where the rice and beans come on the side.   Update: I went back today (3 or so days later) and I ordered the same items but the total was less today so I was either under charged today or over charged on my first order. Just be aware to check your receipt :)"}
{"text":"If you want some authentic Mexican, this is THE place to go in Madison. I was incredibly impressed by the lengua and chorizo tacos, and the \"mi mexico\" platter is a great value for $10, giving you a BIG portion of flank steak, grilled nopales, beans, and peppers! I didn't have a chance to try the tortas or huaraches, but watching them cook up on the flattop grill was awesome.  Two warnings:   1) This is a converted row house, so there isn't that much seating. There's a couple of small tables and a big countertop / bar that runs around the grill.  2) When they're really going and have all of the gas stoves and grills going, you get a very distinct whiff of gas in the place. It didn't bother me too much, but some people may not like that."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in the area. I've loved everything I've tried here. The tacos with lengua and steak and cactus salad are my favorites."}
{"text":"I feel really guilty writing this, because this is my Madison Mexican secret place (MMSP), but I'm feeling generous.  Yes, this place has good food; really, really good food. *You cannot get better/more authentic Mexican food in Madison. Plus the name is fun to say.  No, it's not a nice place- It's the first floor of someone's house, which makes it even more legit in my book. Actually I''m currently on a waiting list to move upstairs of Guadalajara.  If you are looking for mediocre chain Mexican food - skip this and go to Pedro's."}
{"text":"Fun fresh and authentic. I would definitely go back. If you're craving Mexican food, try Taqueria, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was browsing through my Bucky Book when I found a coupon that said \"two free tacos.\" I thought well I do like Mexican food s, so why not? I went down about 11:30 and sat right at the counter in front. They instantly hand me a menu and ask me what I'd like to drink. I tell them Coca Cola, they bring me a glass bottle. I order my two tacos, one steak, and one chicken.   After I order a guy walks in and sits two seats down, he looks familiar.... I see his name tag on his shirt. It's Chris Rickert the columnist from Wisconsin State Journal. Mr. Rickert was there to interview the owners about the redevelopment of the Park Street area near Fish Hatchery Road. Turns out the owners of the restaurant just bought the building yesterday... She said she is not going anywhere and her family loves Madison. I earned myself as little spot in the article as Chris and I started talking about his columns and the food.   Chris and I came to a determination, Taqueria Guadalajara is the best Mexican food in town. Service was great and food tasted very fresh. I will be back for sure, also prices are awesome $1.75 for a taco!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff!  Headed here based on reviews after Canoecopia.  There were Six of us.  All enjoyed their burritos - chicken and beef.  I had tacos al pastor that were he best i have ever eaten.  The guac is a definite order!  Line out the door on a Saturday at 2pm we just missed the rush...eat here!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed my favorite Madison Mexican joint?  This place is sooo good.  Free salsa and chips? Check. A nice assortment of Mexican Brews? Check.  Fresh Tamales? Check. The only thing they are missing is Margaritas.   I swear you could order your food and have it served in the time its takes Univision to do a commercial break.  They are that fast.    I had never had a huarache before coming here.  Now the Huarache Mexicano is my go to.  My gf loves the burritos.  Their tacos al pastor are a lesson in simple awesomeness.    I actually came here up talk up their chicken chimichanga.  I was hungover and wanted some comfort food that only The Taqueria could offer.  I had heard the chimis were awesome but I never got around to trying the deep fried goodness.  Oh My God was it great.  It was cheesy fried awesome.   I don't want to know how many calories are in a deep fried chicken burrito.  The worst part about my last visit is now I know I like deep fried chicken burritos.  I didn't need to know that.  I was perfectly fine with regular burritos. Oh Well."}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Mexican food I have ever had! Had the QUESADILLA MEXICANA with  marinated pork. Wonderful flavors!  This place isn't fancy, but the food is fantastic and the prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"Pros;  tacos have lots of meat on them They have cabeza  Tortillas taste hand made Meats are juicy and very minimal fat  Cons; Salsa is poor  Arguable con; Price is $2.90 a taco"}
{"text":"i've been making my way through the cheaper mexican restaurants around town for years and was just introduced to this place- I hope I'll never have to go anywhere else.  The tiny, rustic atmosphere makes you feel like you just left madison and wandered into mexico accidentally and the enormous delicious portions are so cheap- exactly the kind of unique experience that makes this place stand out."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Mexican with very reasonable prices. We tried enchiladas (chicken) in verde sauce and the chimichanga with Pork. Though the chimichanga was a little greasy but perfectly crispy on the outside. They serve warm colorful chips with an awesome spicy salsa and okayish mild one. Do try the guac, it's nice and refreshing. We also gulped the meal down with a Jarrito lime, a good call."}
{"text":"I will just briefly add to the chorus of positive reviews. I went on Cinco de Mayo, and even though they had a crowd, the service was quick and friendly. I had a taco with lengua, and enchiladas de mole. Both excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome. Their sauces are great, service and prices are good. Plus they give you a lot of food. Plus they're pretty great."}
{"text":"A great little hole-in-the wall, authentic, that is SUPER kid friendly. Perhaps the best authentic Mexican in Madison. Awesome salsa. Friendly staff. Don't kill it you hipsters."}
{"text":"Tiny hole-in-the-wall...two tables that can seat 2 people each, and then a small counter.  Most of the kitchen is right before your eyes--so you can see how they prepare the food.  The food here?  Absolutely top-notch.  Very fresh.  Muchisimo sabor!!!  The hot salsa here is so flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it even when my face was burning.  Lots of fresh avocado, onion, cilantro, everything was so good and balanced just right."}
{"text":"All these years I have gone without knowing about chicken huaraches. I highly recommend ordering the Mexican sandal plate (huarache). The dish comes with masa (dough) on the bottom with beans, cheese, meat, sour cream, and avo on top. I also ordered chicken and steak tacos with beans and rice, which was yummy as well, but nothing to remember like the huarache. Initially I had asked for grilled chicken, but they only have shredded chicken, which was amazing! It tasted like they had my grandma in the back kitchen cooking it up.  4 stars because the horchata tasted like someone just threw a cup of sugar in the milk. Where's that cinnamon at? I'll pass on the horchatas and keep it simple with some water."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Madison! Amazing price, super fast service, and lots of options. Not a lot of room for dinning but made for a nice atmosphere. Will be my go to spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Tasty authentic Mexican food. Small seating area but quick service. Bathrooms were very clean. Salsa is a little thin but tastes good. Could have used a second basket of chips. Tacos come wrapped in 2 corn tortillas.  UPDATE: Then next time we went they were on top of refilling chips and salsa and even brought a hot salsa which was true to its name but delicious.  Ordered Nachos Mexicanos, no meat but added veggies. Tasty and a huge portion. Wish they put queso on them instead of just melted cheese though."}
{"text":"Yet another gem from a Madison Hole in the Wall restaurant. The Platillo Guadalajara was my prime choice and I was not disappointed. The price is very affordable and the service was very good. Definitely gets my vote for best Mexican restaurant in Madison!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 star except that I'm still a tough love reviewer and I only reserve 5 stars for impeccable ambiance and food to match.  The food was delicious and the wait staff was very attentive.  I had the torta de carne asada, and my dining buddy ordered the torta mexicana.  I know a thing or two about tortas because my family used to run a taco truck in the 1990s with only Mexican customers. I expected the torta de carne asada to be similar to what my friend ordered, the torta mexicana-- a flat strip of tender meat, cilantro, and tomato, mayonnaise, salsa, etc.  I would order what she ordered since my torta carne asada came undone too easily.  I don't want to be a messy eater if I'm about to go to another meeting afterwards.   Enough with categories-- the tacos looked delicious, and free chips and salsa. the spicy salsa was pretty spicy, stick to the red mild sauce for the faint of heart.  This isn't child's play.   I also ordered the horchata rice milk cinnamon beverage. Good stuff.   To one side of me was a group of gringolandia college badgers, and to my right were Mexican customers who only spoke Spanish with the owners, in a very friendly demeanor as though they are regulars. The seating availability during lunch was spacious, but it might be during when school was not in session.   Try this place before you decide to drop money at a chain Mexican burrito place."}
{"text":"Damn, sooo good. Great portions. Friendly staff.  I will be back. Place is worth the drive from the northwest"}
{"text":"I don't know Mexican, but I know what I like. And this is it. Also, it's cheap. Easily spend less than $7 on a meal.  I was introduced by a friend who lived down the street. He's since moved, which removed a ready excuse to visit this fantastic place. Luckily another friend has moved into the area.  I just love the flavor of of the food here, my absolute favorite being the steak huarache (avocado, lettuce, tomato, and meat piled onto a flatbread). It starts out great, but spoon a bunch of the mild salsa (true, I can't take too much heat growing up in the Midwest, but I like chunks of veggies in my salsa and the flavor more than the saucy hot) and it gets even better. The tortas (big ol' sandwich) are also good for a change of pace. Haven't been able to resist the standbys enough to get deeper into the menu so I can't comment on the burritos, enchiladas, etc but have heard good things from my friends."}
{"text":"I've been there numerous times. Quite frankly, I don't get the hype.   I'll keep it short: The food here is good. Tacos are good. Tortas are good. Mole is good. Unfortunately, \"good\" doesn't get you very far in Madison.  Advice: Go to Guanajuatance for great tacos and, well, everything. Mercado Marimar is better. Hell, even Gemelos is superior.  Sorry, Guadalajara. You just don't cut it anymore."}
{"text":"Very good, but not the best in Madison. Great steak and pork tacos, with the tortillas cooked in griddle grease. Yum. Decent torta though it's covered in margarine. Definitely worth a visit.   The only thing is that this place is really dirty and grimy. It qualifies as 'beyond-dive' in that way, though everything is cooked out in the open and in front of you and seems professional enough. Why not just mop the floors once in a while?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in town. Fast service, low prices, high quality. Can be very crowded during peak hours, I suggest ordering take out nights and weekends as you can often wait 30 min for a table, but only 15 min for takeout order to be done. (and you can call ahead) I eat here several days a week, everything on the menu is great. The mi rancho, tamales verdes and huraches are my favorites. Grilled cactus is the best side dish."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this restaurant in hopes of a good torta ahogada. Therefore, replacing the place we visit in Chandler.    At the time of ordering a lady which might of been the owner was in the back of the register grabbing chips and all sorts of things, but that isn't my problem. She went to grab chips no gloves no nothing and just grabbed the chips out with her hand when the tongs were next to the chips. Needless to say we and the people after that were served out of the same tray with the tongs.   I realize this might not be a major crime, but please she looked at me as she did it. If these things are going on with customers watching what might be going on in the back where we cannot see.   We should of maybe listened to all of the reviews on the tacos and just done the drive to Chandler for a torta ahogada. The torta just tasted like a carnitas (pork meat sandwich) with the red salsa they provide at the bar poured on top. I had a regular quesadilla de asada, which consisted of mainly fat.   The service was really good the lady taking our order was friendly and the food did come out fast. But friendliness and fast food doesn't bring customers back."}
{"text":"Divey goodness at its best! This is a tiny family-run restaurant serving really good, authentic Mexican food. My Mexican husband and I checked this place out recently after a few recommendations from friends in Madison. We were both really impressed (which is really hard to do - especially my husband) with everything.    I had a carne asada huarache - which was a large plate of excellent carne asada, lettuce, onion, cilantro, avocado and cheese atop a thick, bready tortilla (sort of like a pita). F was excited that they had tacos de tripa (I won't explain) but he also got asada and one al pastor. It was all great.  Excellent prices - great, authentic tacos, friendly operators - go here!"}
{"text":"I'm spoiled from the south side of Milwaukee where food carts and restaurants serving excellent food are aplenty.   Still, they serve two tacos for two bucks on corn tortillas with carne asata, cilantro, and onion. That's my goto whenever I hit up the pink house."}
{"text":"Our first time today, food was really good service was great very friendly and clean, my only thing were the salsa's they were way to hot for me."}
{"text":"I haven't had good Mexican food in Madison since I first started visiting in 2009, so I was excited to try this place that some local Madison friends enjoy. Guadalajara Taqueria is a small restaurant with a counter for maybe five people and seating in the back with maybe 8 tables. We got seated around 6pm on a Tuesday evening, and the places was packed with a line by the time we left.  Like many taquerias, we were served chips and salsa when we sat down at our table. The chips were kind of fun because they were red, green, and yellow, and the salsa was good, but nothing outstanding. Our chips were refilled when we finished them.  I ordered a burrito mexicana with carne asada. It was a standard burrito on the inside with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream covering the top to visually look like the Mexican flag. Creative! The burrito was good, though what I crave is a San Francisco super burrito.  We also ordered a side of nopales (cactus) and grilled jalapeños. I enjoyed both.  I give this place four stars for Madison, but if it were in California, it'd get three stars."}
{"text":"My understanding is this place was recently re-constructed after a burn-down fire -- nice work!  The interior is welcoming but definitely sit by the back if you can.  Lunch gets verrrry busy so aim to time it right.    As far as food, I can only speak to the tacos which were flavorful and mostly authentic.  The other dishes looked hearty and balanced.  The appetizer chips didn't appear to be made on site, which is disappointing -- but the salsa seemed homemade.  Service is attentive and prices reasonable.  I look forward to working my way around the menu."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and got my order correct. It was cooked to perfection. The restaurant was clean and so we're the bathrooms. The price of the meal I felt was fair. I will probably make this my go to place when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Always passed by this resturant when driving on park street  and finally decided to come in and check it out. Upon walking in inmediately greeted by open kitchen which was clean and professional. Sat in the comfortable dining area in the back. Had the enchiladas verdes which were extremely tasty and portioned well for the price. Also had the beef tongue tacos which were again well portioned but less tasty in my opinion. Drank their horchata which was very good. It was spiced more than what I have had in the past which I enjoyed. Overall I have never been a huge fan of mexican food but I found the food here very tasty, reasonably priced and quite satisfying. Will come again."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed. The place was messy the service sometimes there or not and the food was one dimentional.   Menudo soup need the cilantro and onions that were on the side to give it some  spark.  The Platillo Guadalajara was good but easily be made at home better. Fresh items with not much herbs or spices added to them.  The only good thing was the Horchata that was perfectly sweet and spiced.  Hopefully just the items I chose. The nacho looked amazing. Steve L. better check them out."}
{"text":"Food is good and reasonably priced. Just look at all the photos posted here!  The staff is very pleasant. We were very pleased with the service.  I was afraid they couldn't accommodate a party if 6 because the place looks so tiny from the front, but there is a decent (small sized) dining room in the rear."}
{"text":"This place is really good, not just 'good for wisconson' or 'good for suburb mexican', It's straight up good. I only had a steak burrito and some guacamole but both were delicious and the guys here were nice. Everything tastes fresh and authentic. Reminds me of Chicago."}
{"text":"Brand new taqueria. Replaced a nasty looking burger joint. Cute little restaurant that holds around 52 people (according to the sign) ! The young lady at the front counter was so nice and patient while we reviewed their extensive menu. Tons of options from burritos, tacos, mole, tortas, and churros! We ordered our good to go and waited about ten mins for fresh food as the chef went to work on our order and the drive thru orders by himself so I'd say that's a good wait time for fresh! The tacos I ordered were flavorful and I ordered 4 thinking they were going to be little but the chef packed them out! I only finished 2! Don't worry they didn't go to waste, my greedy husband took care of them.  Everything ordered had good portions but a bit pricey. Maybe I'm just accustomed to Mexican food being cheap because I'm from Texas ?. Overall we're happy with our food and service so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food in Madison HANDS DOWN.  Great assortment of options - from specials like Camarones a la Diabla  (Spiiiiiicy!) to your quintessential Mexican fare like tacos, enchiladas, tostadas - all done with an 'authentic', spicy, flavorful flare!  Ambiance is very mom+pop-ish - understated, very cramped, mixture of families, singles, and a few good friends.  AKA not the kind of place you go on a nice date.  Still, somehow this modesty adds to the fun for me (and I think it does for the other patrons as well).    Love it."}
{"text":"Marisol and Martin were working today at the (day before) Labor Day party I attended with my family. It was a Mexican themed fiesta, with authentic food thanks to taqueria Guadalajara!  Brilliant and oh so fitting...and the tacos were delicious.   Guests had their choice of rice, beans, and tortillas with chicken, pork or beef (I had chicken) + a huge condiment bar including veggies, chips, and several types of salsa.  I am not sure what the cost was to bring these guys in, but I totally may have to \"borrow\" this idea for future entertaining needs. Gracias amigos... Ojala probarte restaurante y verte mas en el futuro pronto!"}
{"text":"Like some people have said, this is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that seems to cater to native Spanish speakers. I'm big on places like that because they usually have pretty good food and provide a cozy, intimate dining experience.  At Taqueria Guadalajara, however, you really don't get that vibe. The place is pretty low end as far as restaurants go (in order to get to the back for additional seating you literally have to walk through the kitchen).  The prices are amazing. You could easily feed a family of 4 for $20 if you wanted. The cost of these low prices, however, is the quality of the food. I will give some bonus points for authentic ingredients and recipes, but the food was mediocre in general.  Overall, the price was right, but you get what you pay for in ambiance and food quality."}
{"text":"Five stars.  Knocked it out of the park.  This is where you should be getting your Mexican food, Madison.  Friendly service, good sized portions, reasonably priced.  Very kid friendly (that's a thing).  I played it safe and went with enchiladas.  But they were rockin.  I can't wait to come back here to try out more options."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Great salsa bar, service and prices. Definitely worth going back to!"}
{"text":"Awesome and fast! Lunch was outstanding, and seriously, the food was up quick. Not a ton of seating, three 4 tops in the back, and two tables and a dinner style bar up front."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall, but in my opinion, great food comes from hole in the walls.   I'd like their carne asada to be a little bit more marinated.  I had two carne asada tacos and one al pastor.  They were generous wiht the cilantro which is a definite plus.  I'd love a salsa verde option, but I'll take what I can get.  I didn't particularly enjoy the burrito as it felt a bit soggy.     There isn't really enough seating for big groups here, but take out is always an option."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place. I was disappointed off the bat when they didn't offer appetizers, like bean dip, etc. Our food was just alright,  enchiladas with mole sauce, portions were small and sort of sad, everything tasted kind of blah. As we left, we paid up front. The waitress wiping down clean silverware dropped the cloth she was wiping silverware with on the dirty floor, picked it up and kept on wiping down \" clean silverware\"... I can't return after that."}
{"text":"We have been on the search for good Mexican in Wisconsin. This is it!!!!  Their salsa is fantastic, fresh and you'll want several helpings. The al pastor (spicy pork) is incredible and their carne asada is delicious. I ordered a chimichanga and my husband and and sister ordered burritos. All of it was great, flavorful, generous portions and best of all, AUTHENTIC.   The service is fast, friendly, and the staff is really friendly.   We'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"Everyone was raving about the tacos so I tried them today and sadly I wasn't impressed. The chicken and beef tacos were super dry because the meat was overcooked. I'll give the tacos another try some other time hopefully I'll have better luck. Aside from that, their tortas are amazing and really filling! The staff is very friendly staff and they have great prices. Don't be fooled by the size though - from the outside it looks really small but once you step inside it's a fairly decent size! I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out.  The Torta was the best.  Very good. Huaraches good but not my thing. Sopes were very good.  Everything had good flavor and the salsas were excellent.   I am so used to Americanized Mexican food that it is hard for me to get used to this more authentic cuisine.  So if you aren't familiar with this style of cooking you may find your meal different from what was expected. The service could be a little bit more friendly.  I like the smallness of the eating area.  If I lived near here I would eat out here just because of it's small space.  Watch the first step inside, it's a big one."}
{"text":"Ok i ordered here for the first time for delivery. My house is litterally less than 10 mins away but i ordered anyway.  1 hr and 50 mins later they came and offered me a free soda and delivery fee deducted. Ok I can deal with that but when i opened the bag totally wrong order.....wow gave them a couple chances but they really blew it with that one. It would take 45 to 60 mins to get the actual food but i went with the full refund which they offered me (Mr. Delivery)"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican around! And you can't beat the low prices. My go-to for Mexican."}
{"text":"1 and a half stars.  Previosly i would have given this place 3 or 4 stars because it is authentic greasy mexican food that was always pretty decent.  However the other day me and my roomate went here for lunch and both got food poisioning.  So I'll  leave you with this caveat, eating at taqueria guadalajara is like rolling a pair of dice.  It might come up good and you get some alright mexican food or you might crap out and get food poisioning.  I definately won't be eating here again but once again that is due pretty much entirely to getting food poisioning which was lame."}
{"text":"All these Yelp reviews hype this place up a bit... I was so excited to go here but the food didn't impress me! The horchata was a spicy (not hot, spice-y!) creamy dream, and my friend described her stuffed chile pepper as a \"veggie delight.\" But the chips and salsa and my other pal's chimichanga were both average, and my Platillo Guadalajara was just meh! The corn tortillas and beans were good, but the beef and veggies were too oily and I didn't like that the cactus side, although tasty, was served cold. Mexican food is Mexican food and it's always good to eat, but I won't go out of my way to come back here! Los Gemelos is still the king of Madison Mexican food in my book."}
{"text":"Tacos and burritos are great - much better than I'd expect to find in the Midwest.  Mole also gets a thumbs up.   Dine in, takeout, delivery options all available.   Small bar up front by the kitchen is a good spot to wait for your takeout."}
{"text":"There was no parking available out front, so we drove around to the side street to see if we could get to the \"additional parking in the rear.\"  We took a chance and turned down a one lane dirt driveway behind some houses.  Bingo!    They have a walkway ramp that leads to the dining area in the back of the restaurant.  When we stepped just inside the door we were immediately greeted by an intense and humid heat.  There was zero air flow in the dining area, and it was quite stifling.  Like another reviewer, Brian T., mentioned you don't know if you should sit down, wait, stand around with your finger up your nose or what.  Everyone who is already sitting at tables looks up at you curiously, and I couldn't help but wonder if we were just gigantic dorks.    I flagged down a waitress who said it would be 1 to 5 minutes before we were seated.  Ok, progress.  But as I'm watching her, she actually went over to one occupied table and asked them to move to another table.  Then she had us sit at their table.  Why?????  I felt kind of awkward and tried not to look in their direction after that.    We ordered a steak chimichanga, chili relenos, potato gordita, and a steak gordita.  They were just ok.  I grew up in California, and I have Mexican friends who taught me some of their authentic Mexican cooking, so I wasn't falling down and convulsing with glee over what we had here.  I definitely wouldn't say it's the best you can find in Madison.  In fact, I'd say it's similar to what you can find just about anywhere in Madison.    After we finished our meals, we waited and waited and waited for a check.  We were sweating because of the overheated dining area, and really just wanted to get the heck out of there.  Check eventually arrived, but not before my dining companion started to have a mini meltdown.   He stood up from the table and looked like he was either going to pass out or start chewing on his shirt like a weirdo.  I was going to send him outside to spare the other patrons, but then I saw the waitress coming with the check and we were all saved.    There were just too many problems here, and the food certainly wasn't worth all of the hassle.  So to all of you reviewers who feel like they are having a religious experience when you go here because its just so good, I say \"enjoy\" because I don't wanna!"}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak.  The delivery service (Eats24) contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito... so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong!  What a joke, food was at best average otherwise.  Won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is good. I found absolutely nothing to be annoyed/upset about, and neither did the wife.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"It was taco Tuesday and I decided to eat here for the first time.  Before I review the restaurant I would like to talk about tacos....and food in general.   I LOVE tacos.   I could eat them more than once a day...and I have (don't judge)!  In my mind there are two types of tacos.  Regular tacos and craft tacos...or fusion...new age...call them whatever you like.  Designer tacos...ok...ok....anywayz....I'm not going to walk into a restaurant like Taqueria Guadalajara and expect tacos like El Dorado Grill just like I'm not going to walk into Glass Nickel and expect pizza like Pizza Brutta.  It's important to know the restaurant BEFORE you go.  I hate all the reviews that say \"meh...it was okay...but nothing outstanding\".  What??  To the restaurant~  I had 4....count 'em....4 tacos.....2 carne asada (steak) and 2 pastor (marinated pork).  They were delicious.  My partner had a chicken quesadilla with beans and rice.  Her's was delicious and she ate all her beans and rice!!  It was what we expected.  I like this place....the food is good....inexpensive....the service was great....they sell beer although we both had diet pepsi...and we had fun."}
{"text":"Establishments like this are the exact reason I am grateful for yelp.  We are currently crossing the country from Maine to Washington and have had to rely on either word of mouth, chain restaurants or (thankfully) yelp.  I can honestly say that we probably never would have found this gem if it had not been for yelp.  First of all, we ate at the counter in the front and watched all the magic in the kitchen.  It was warm upfront, but my husband cooled himself with a Negro Modelo, I enjoyed a mandarin soda and our daughter stuck with water.  Everyone was terrifically friendly.  It was a delight to watch all the cooking happening.  The food was incredible to boot.  I had a chicken chimichanga which came with rice, beans and lettuce, my husband had a burrito mexicano with a gordita on the side and our daughter had three chicken tacos.  Combine this with tortilla chips and some of the best salsa I have ever had and we were in heaven.  Just when we thought our meal couldn't get any better, one kindly gentleman who worked here gifted us with a green tamale, on the house.  It.  Was. AMAZING.  Fresh, perfect consistency and positively tasty.  And then there is the thing that drive this amazing establishment into overdrive:  The price.  The grand total for all of the delicious, tasty goodness above?  $26.  Seriously.  The three of us can hardly go out for breakfast at that price, let alone some of the best mexican food we have ever had.    If you are in Madison run, don't walk, to Taqueria Guadalajara.  You will be delighted that you did."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! I had the chimichanga with steak and my husband had the burrito Mexicano. Both were very good and I don't think I've ever had a better chimichanga in my life! The horchada is also very creamy and flavorful. Our new Mexican restaurant favorite!"}
{"text":"When most people think of Mexican food, they imagine Chipotle. This makes me sad. Mexican food, like Southern food, doesn't look all that fancy, but they taste fantastic. And Taqueria Guadalajara achieves this, in my opinion. I've been their twice now - first time I ordered enchiladas de mole, and the second time I got their marinated beef tongue and some tacos. They do a good job making sure the meats are marinated thoroughly, and they have what seems to be house-made salsa with two spiciness levels, which you can use to taste. Also their beef tongue, scary as that might sound, is actually *incredibly* tender. It's really cozy, and they're open fairly late too - two more points in their favor."}
{"text":"The best burritos in the area.  I wish there were more beer options, but the food is still fantastic.  Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I thought the catering prices for the chain Mexican places in town were high, so looked for the highest rated Madison Mexican place  when I wanted catering for a birthday party. Called  Taqueria Guadalajara as they were ranked favorite Mexican in Madison. So glad I did!! They were happy to recommend portion amounts and favorite dishes. I requested the order for 4 p.m. on a Sunday and it was hot and instantly ready when we went to pick it up. Their service is outstanding and everyone at the party raved about the food, especially the guacamole, gorditas and their homemade salsa. They provided an entire gallon tray full of fresh onion,lettuce, tomato, lime wedges and cilantro: like at least 20 limes! We will be back: recommend them for any event or meal. By the way, the cost was about half what the chains charge."}
{"text":"This is a busy little place for good reason. The food is always fine, the service fast and friendly, and the prices are nice"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some afternoon tacos because I had heard so much about this place. The tacos were really good and the staff was extremely friendly. Great child and salsa as well. I was also really surprised to see how crowded it was for 3:30 on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in Madison. Eat here ASAP."}
{"text":"Friendly and Efficient Customer Service. I Love their Al Pastor Fries which is marinated in Fresh Pineapple and grilled well done. Oh So Good!"}
{"text":"No one does Mexican food better in Madison than Taqueria Guadalajara. The best part is - every time I go, I try something new. So, I cannot provide a quality review on one single menu item, but I can say they do it right. There's usually some form of soccer/futbol playing on the televisions, and the homemade chips and salsa are completely satisfying.   The weekend specials are worth the dedicated trip - I had menudo for the first time here and was delighted. While I'm not one to order tripe (beef stomach) specifically - it's use in this soup was spot on.  Overall Taqueria Guadalajara offers wonderful service, wonderful food, and a wonderful atmosphere. Make a trip, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"God bless this restaurant. I thought good Mexican food didn't exist in Madison...then I realised I was talking to people who thought a to-remain-nameless local tex mex chain was \"pretty great\" \"Mexican\" \"food.\" and then I found Taqueria Guadalajara, and my life hasn't been the same since.   They have super friendly and fast service, insanely good prices, cute decor, and amaaaaazing food. They are super busy on weekends so prepare for a wait but it will be worth it! Try the pozole, available only on weekends. It's incredibly soothing and satisfying, the perfect cold weather and/or hangover cure. They also have the best horchata in town. Taqueria Guadalajara forever!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the pink siding and the decor inside scare you away.  The food here is in my top 3 in Madison.  Basically working off of a flat top and deep fryer, the small kitchen puts out solid and delicious (and very affordable) eats.  Their tacos are great.  Classic two corn tortillas wrapped around a meat, cilantro, and onions.  They bring out two different types of salsa for you to choose from.  Make sure you try either the sopes (ingredients on top) or the gordita (ingredients stuffed inside).  Both are made using a thicker tortilla that puffs up when fried. They are out of this world and for around $2.50 each, they are a bargain.  Note:  If you decide to sit in the front of the restaurant, be prepared to carry the smells of the kitchen with you the rest of the day.  To me, a small price to pay to eat excellent fare!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Tied for most authentic Mexican restaurant in town.  Prices are great and never had anything bad.    I will be a bit more adventurous and get the beef tongue next time.    They provide two salsas.  Both are good.  They are slightly stingy on how much they pour but will pour more for you.     One minor knock is that the way the main dining area is built it can be a bit loud from the various conversations.  I almost knocked the rating to 4 for that reason.   I choose not to because I don't expect it to be easy to converse here.  Meaning, not a great place for an I'm getting to know you date."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Got the alambres plate and is was cooked perfectly and very flavorful, the sliced bacon gave it amazing flavor. They have some of the best salsa I have ever tired, the habanero salsa had a good kick to it."}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly excellent service! During a very busy night with a large group, we always had chips and full cups of water.  That being said, I tried the chips and guacamole, two types of tacos (pork and steak) as well as the steak quesadilla meal. The chips and guacamole were tasty and the guac was well done. The tacos were alright, with the flavor of the pork ones being much more bold and tasty. With some lime squeezed on, they're pretty tasty. I do think that Tienda Los Gamelos has better tacos though.  The steak quesadilla was also very good. It was very cheesy and thick, and if this is what you're looking for, very very very filling and oily (but that's something you have to have once in awhile, right?). The refried beans and rice that come with it are very tasty. The minor downsides, again, are the crazy greasiness as well as the tiny portion of guac that is included (less than a tablespoon).  However, overall, this is a budget friendly establishment with great, authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Madison.    It's a little small, and noisy, but the staff is always friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place isn't the best restaurant in Madison.  It's not even the best Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Best Mexican-Restaurant-Housed-In-An-Obnoxiously-Pink-Building?  I think we can safely give it that.  A work colleague and I were in downtown Madison the other day and looking for a place to have lunch.  Usually when we want Mexican and are a bit further west La Guanajuatence is our go-to place.  Being further east I scoured Yelp and found that Guadalajara was likely our best bet.  We were not disappointed.  I just want to say that this is only a four-star review because the previously mentioned place got five-stars from me and Guadalajara was just not quite as good.  In every other way other than direct comparison it was spectacular.  I had a chicken sope and a three-pack of tacos.  One tripe, one tongue, and one el pastor.  My colleague had a pork chimichanga.  Obviously, we both had chips and salsa + Mexican coke.  Chips and salsa were good.  I see other reviewers rave about them, but I really thought they were only okay.  La Guanajuatence has a salsa BUFFET w/ fifteen salsas.  You really can't compare the two.  Tacos were GREAT.  The tripe taco was the best thing I've eaten yet this year.  It's probably better than anything I ate most of last year.  Crunchy one one side and soft and unctuous on the other.  It was the highlight of my week, seriously.  So so so good.  Everything else was delish as well.  The sope was chewy and thick and cheesy and delicious.  W/ a little of the hot salsa from the chips on top it was just what I needed to top off the meal.  Service was awesome.  We were on a tight schedule, let the waitress know this and were in/out w/in thirty minutes of placing our order.  I really enjoyed this place and will go again w/out hesitation if we're in the area.  That said, since I gave La Guanajuatence five-stars I don't see how I can give this place the same rating.  Four Stars from me, but go yourself because it's probably five-stars good."}
{"text":"We're traveling and trusted yelp to find a restaurant.  This was authentic, delicious and best mex I've had in a long while (since taco alley in cancun).  If you like true mex with homemade everything this is it."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Lovely little place, they cook the food right there, authentic, and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Passing thru Sunday afternoon from Rockford, Siri helped us find this place.  Not much to look at but great food, fast service, and clean. I had enchilada dinner.  Wife had tomale dinner. Server a little short on personality but pleasant. Good prices."}
{"text":"Good Mexican option.  Best I have found so far in the 608."}
{"text":"Maybe fast food and fast food-esque burgers didn't work out here, but these tasty tacos have a good chance.  Taqueria Guadalajara is a new fast-casual restaurant on Boulder Highway just north of the more well-known Omelet House on this road. If you're approaching from the north, take the turn after the Hyundai dealer, then settle into the small parking lot and get inside.  The menu is straightforward and what you'd expect at a typical taqueria: tacos, burritos, tortas, plates, and various appetizers. I went for the regular tacos ($2.50) and had five of 'em, all with different meats. It's Cinco de Mayo after all.  Cochinita Pibil: pork achiote. Easily my favorite meat here so far and my favorite cochinita pibil, and the reason I was trying to convince myself to give this place five stars. This is a marinated, sauced pork that is rich in flavor but not spicy. The meat itself is very tender. Get this.  Cabeza: beef head meat. One of the better versions of this meat which I've had as of late. Fatty bits mixed with the meaty bits, along with the typical cilantro, onions, and salsa verde.  Al pastor: adobo marinated pork. Not the best pork here or the best al pastor around, but it was delicious despite not having any pineapple or caramelized onions - yes, the latter are in one rendition which I've tried.  Lengua: beef tongue. This was tender and pretty good, but not as much of a standout as the cabeza or as rich in flavor as the al pastor.  Tripitas: beef intestine. It wasn't bad, but it was slightly less interesting than the rest. Perhaps it was because I was pretty full and ate this last? That said, I didn't ask for them to prepare it extra crispy, so maybe that would be a positive change next time.  Tacos all came with two corn tortillas, although they didn't quite cook the tortillas as much as some places do. I also got a small complimentary portion of tortilla chips, which go well with the salsas off in the corner. The habanero is labeled as very spicy, but be careful with the two pico de gallo salsas on the right-hand side. They look similar, but one was mild and the other was pretty hot. Otherwise, I didn't have any issues handling the spiciness in that area.  Taqueria Guadalajara is an excellent choice for cochinita pibil and a solid taco joint apart from that. I'm glad that they're on my side of town, and I'll definitely be back again when a craving strikes."}
{"text":"Get the tacos!  I've been here loads of times and 99% of the time I go for the tacos. My favorites preparations are carne asada, chicken, and their vegetarian. I always order a mix of the three. I love their corn tortillas, but they have flour tortillas too if you ask for them.  They also have fantastic horchata! Tastes just like Christmas!  The staff are really friendly and they are very fast on take out orders."}
{"text":"Out with the old (Burger Shoppe) and in with the new (Taqueria Guadalajara). It was a quick turn around but seems like a worthy one to me. This taqueria fed me well the other night when I finally stopped in.  I considered getting tacos but I instead ordered a burrito. Not just any burrito, in fact, but a Super Burrito. Rice, cheese, avocado, sour cream and choice of meat and beans. I went with pollo asado (grilled chicken) and black beans. It took just a couple of fast minutes for them to prepare and serve this burrito. Quicker than I expected honestly.   I took the burrito home on this night. I'm more comfortable at home. By the time I got home the burrito was still hot. Mayne because of the way it was wrapped in all the foil it was wrapped in. It took me forever to open the damn thing. It was kind of funny. But then came that first bite and, holy guacamole, it was good. The chicken was grilled perfectly. The sour cream and avocado were placed throughout the entire burrito. And when I say avocado I mean nice solid slices of fresh avocado. None of this prepared avocado sauce. Everything in this beast was perfect and harmonious.   It was a lot of food though. They make a sizeable burrito here. By the time I reached the last few bites I almost didn't want to finish. I was stuffed. I would order it again but maybe when I am more hungry. I would also still like to try the tacos. I imagine they would be of the same quality as the burrito but with the ability to manage consumption better.  The service was friendly. My food came out hot and fast. More importantly it was delicious. I got a small bag of chips with my meal. And I was full by the time I finished. This is a solid place which I hope stays around longer than the former tennant of this location."}
{"text":"We were able to get a table about an hour before they closed. My roommate had already tried this place out and highly recommended it.  Great lunch and dinner spot. The parking -- limited. Tables are limited too. It seemed like a lot of folks were getting to-go orders, which is such a great idea. The food comes out FAST and HOT. I was pleasantly surprised.  I love their chips and salsa. Their enchiladas are great. The rice and beans are good too. Service is pretty attentive. I haven't tried other menu items. I'm pretty basic -- give me good beans, rice and enchiladas and you are a keeper."}
{"text":"Holy hell this place is good! Gorditas are ridiculous. I just finished my meal and ordered a 2nd helping."}
{"text":"Very small place, super friendly service, really good food, awesome family \"feel\". 1st come, 1st serve seating. Went with a party of 6 total. 2 adults, 2 young children, 2 college kids. There were two large parties of people (6 top & 8 top) waiting to be seated when we arrived. We arrived as my 5 year old was melting down from hunger (and sitting through his sisters orchestra concert). Waiting was becoming a problem--shortly after we arrived as my 65 lb child was sprawled across the only hallway between the kitchen and seating area--he was just DONE. One of the staff, saw me struggling to get my kid up & took it upon herself to bring him a basket of chips & salsa!!! She smiled sympathetically while delivering them. OMG my kid got up and started cooing over the tricolored chips while scarfing them down. That move on the part of that lovely staff person was one of the most thoughtful public displays of parenting support i have ever experienced. We were seated about 7-10 minutes after we arrived. The food itself was very good. All fresh, good flavor, good size portion without being overwhelming."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! I do have to say that I like tienda los gemelos a little bit better but they are quite comparable. The food is cheap and the service was fantastic. They brought us chips promptly and our water glasses were always full. That is always appreciated! The tacos I had were good and the quesadilla was very very filling. Overall an awesome experience, one of the better ethnic food options around."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to see new restaurants near us, as choices are very limited. I have to say that this restaurant is very good, I'm very glad that I tried it. The portions are huge and the meat is very tasty. I ordered three regular tacos two Asada and one grilled chicken. I was only able to finish 1 and 1/2 because they are very generous with the meat! Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened and it is now my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Jesus, owner/chef, and his entire staff are friendly and the food is authentically spiced and cooked to perfection.  I had the carnitas super taco (has more toppings than the regular taco) with a side of rice and beans and I was stuffed.  They brought a large basket of taco chips to my table and they have about 6 different salsas from mild to spicy.  They will be adding beer and wine to the menu in the future.  Jesus plans to have a grand opening soon so visit it now before it becomes famous and you have to wait to be seated.  Very casual atmosphere and prices are reasonable.  Everything is cooked to order so, unlike so many places, nothing is frozen and microwaved.  Plenty of parking .  They will serve the traditional Menudo on week-ends so will be back."}
{"text":"On our way back from Chicago, we stopped here for some Mexican food.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  I had the PLATILLO GUADALAJARA Steak, refried beans, cactus salad (nopales), fried onions, pico de gallo and a deep-fried jalapeño. Served with warm tortillas.  My fiancée had the ENCHILADAS DE MOLE Two corn tortillas rolled and stuffed with chicken or cheese, covered with our homemade mole sauce, melted cheese and sour cream. Served with rice and refried beans.  My dish won some awards and found the cactus salad to be very good.  It was nice to wrap my own tortillas with steak, beans, and cactus.  I was concerned about the spice but it was perfectly fine.  She like her dish as well and we were full and satisfied."}
{"text":"5 stars for the recently added fried (pressure fried)  and roasted chicken menu items- came for tacos, they brought us a sample of the chicken, and I had that instead.  2.5 stars for regular taqueria menu items."}
{"text":"I think authentic pretty well sums it up. This spot has excellent basic Mexican staples, is affordable, and probably rocks it out for best Mexican in Madison. Very different atmosphere from La Mestiza, which is typically quiet and more private. This place is bustling and loud; great for groups. The tacos were delicious, served on double corn tortillas (good move). Chips and salsa were so-so (Mestiza much better). Odd thing: soft drinks served in individual cans, not as fountain beverage (not a huge fan). But overall, where it counts-- for an entree, this place was the bomb."}
{"text":"Their chips they served were lackluster and there wasn't enough salsa. My taco was fantastic, but the gordita was not good. I was just disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited this place for an event showcasing other local South Madison eatery's and I am definitely a fan.  I actually cannot believe that I have not been here before.  The food is fantastic!  I ordered the tacos with rice and beans, so simple but so good.  The meat was really tender and well seasoned.  I should also mention that the chips and salsa pre-taco were also really good; you are given two options, one with kick and one without.  Both options were really good.    I look forward to coming back to this place and trying many things on the well sized and well priced menu."}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic food. We all shared flautas and some tacos, which were delicious. The interior is nothing fancy, but the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I'd give it five stars if only the Camerones Diablo were always on the menu. They are very hot, and very, very, very good, but are an occasional special. -- The horchatas are also a bit better than the usual."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on our way to visit the Clark County Museum and the Hoover Dam.  Read the reviews and decided to try it out.  I had wanted the Dos Fish Taco, but they were out and recommend substituting shrimp.  My husband had the shrimp burrito. Both meals were outstanding and seasoned perfectly. I loved the salsa bar, especially the creamy avocado. Everything was very fresh.  The grilled onions and peppers in my tacos were slightly blackened and added some perfect smoky flavor.   So glad we found this great little place."}
{"text":"Fast,  in my neighborhood,  friendly.  Slight grilled flavor to my asada super burrito. Huge, filled to the brim.  I know there were other components,  I could see them, but truly great beef flavor. Now I don't want to be totally out of line but let me be straight.  You know that hungry? The hungry we get as a woman when it's that time of month?  The I'm so starved I could eat the ass out of a rotting rhino kind of hungry?  That was my appetite tonight.  After this burrito I'm feeling the beast curl up for the night.  It's no longer gnawing at me threatening to cause me to rip something from limb to limb to satiate my hunger. I may just delete my Cafe Rio app after this.   Oh, and the avacado verde salsa is tangy,  spicy,  creamy.  I'm in food heaven right now."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food is hard to find in the Midwest, but you can find some here. The corn tortillas are made fresh, which makes a world of difference. The salsa is spicy, and the pastor and carne asada tacos are what you should get. They also offer classic Mexican dishes like mole, chile relleno, and menudo and pozole on the weekend. Tacos are served Mexico City street taco style with only chopped onions and cilantro on top. The only thing I don't really like about Taqueria Guadalajara is that the entrance opens onto the kitchen, which feels really weird. Dining room is in the back."}
{"text":"Best in Madison by far. I have had almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed yet. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp because I never would have tried this restaurant without reading the great reviews!  The food was absolutely incredible - good sized portions, very cheap, very flavorful.   We sat at the counter, so we were able to watch them make our meals, which I highly recommend.  I had the veggies tacos and the potato gordita, my husband had the mole burrito - everything was so good!  I can see how the atmosphere could scare some people away, but I think it added to the experience of eating there."}
{"text":"Probably the best kept secret in Madison.  If you think you like Mexican you haven't seen anything yet.  Go here and you'll never eat faux Mexican (i.e. Taco Bell, Chipotle, etc.) ever again.  You can get a seat at the bar and watch them cook the food right in front of you with Telemundo playing in the background.  This place is authentic Mexican food and the people are very nice.  I am a fan of the sopes and their cow tongue is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean restaurant. Great customer service. Only issue we had was on the cheese that is crumbled over the enchiladas, a huge hair smack right in the middle of it. Due to having facial hair myself, right away I could tell that it was from a mustache or beard. From there we looked towards the kitchen and noticed that the counter girl, who was also helping in the kitchen, had her hair in a loose pony tail with no hairnet. Pretty sure whoever had facial hair was not covering their face as they were cooking as well. This might have changed our view on the food before we even began eating. But nonetheless, without complaint, we ate and the food was good. Very generous portions and you are given fresh chips and salsa while you wait (which was great). Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I can't say I've tried a lot of the dishes on this menu before, but that's only because the first thing I tried at this place was their beef tongue, pork stomach, and beef intestine tacos; I love them so much that I've never really had the urge to get anything else! Of course, those tacos are not for everyone's tastes but I really love that traditional items like those are available here. I've tried bites of their burritos as well as bites of their dinner platters and really found those to be tasty, too. Really, I just love to bring others here so I can order my tacos and steal bites from their order so I can sample more of the menu--ha!"}
{"text":"OMG.  I LOVED this place.  It is exactly what I look for in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  The atmosphere is crowded and chaotic.  The prices are low.  And the food is great.  I had chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, but I plan to be back for much more."}
{"text":"The food was delicious will definitely be coming back. The employees here are very nice ."}
{"text":"I've lived in Henderson for a year and 1 month.  My husband and I moved from Chicago and were completely spoiled with the most delicious Latin food.  Tacos, burritos, carne Asada, shrimp Diablo and so on.  It was always fantastic.    We have had extreme difficulty finding anything worthy of being called good here in NV. Yesterday we tried the regular sizes chorizo and chicken tacos and they were slightly better than good.    I only have four stars because the meat options are not as good as I'd like.  I do not want chitlin tacos.  The beef option was from an odd part of the animal and I couldn't bring myself to try it.  The tacos we had were flavorful and spicy.  The chorizo was so spicy that we were both blowing our noses.  We like that kind of spice.   I found the two regular sized tacos and a handful of chips (free when you eat in) to be very filling.  Right now this is the only place I know of to get a decent taco."}
{"text":"DON'T LET THE SHADY PINK BUILDING FOOL YOU! YELP helped me discover this hidden gem. The food was super good and super authentic. I found my inner fatman while I was here and sampled two tacos, a gordita, and sope. The TACOS were to die for. By far MY FAVORITE. I had one steak and one pork. DELICIOUS! The SOPE and GORDITA were just more of the same goodness in a fried tortilla. Super Good, and Super Cheap. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is five stars for food but the service is lacking. Food is the best in Madison. The chips and salsa possibly the best I've ever had. The only problem is they give you a really small basket and you have to ask a few times for a refill of the chips but be sure to always ask for salsa because getting them to refill that is also a chore. Everything I've had is delicious not a bad item on the menu. The taco dinner only comes with two but they are hearty and filling even if you're use to getting three."}
{"text":"1st off its new and they have a few service issues but are so friendly they made it fun to deal with.  The tacos are excellent and the menu has everything even Vegan options. I'm not vegan, just want to make that clear lol The orders from other tables looked great too. .............. They had a salsa bar but No pickled carrots or onion and cucumber, If you're the owner and reading this, that's a must.  I will give you the 5th star when I see the carrots"}
{"text":"First visit here, the shop just opened about 3 months ago.   Super Tacos Carnitas: Amazing. I bought three not knowing what to expect I would have been completely satisfied with just one. They are topped with avocado slices and sour cream, not my usual go to but glad I wasn't turned away by it. I absolutely loved the combination and the flavor was well balanced. I finished two and had to take the last one home. It was well worth the $4.50 charge per taco. The super taco is the perfect blend of a taco and a sope.  Carne Asada Fries: Huge, fresh guacamole, jalapeños, sour cream, the usual. It tasted really good and I'm not someone who would normally order this for myself. I was allowed to taste and can safely safe they were great. Everything just tasted fresh, the meat was flavorful, everything was bountiful.   Charritos: $7 It came with 8 slices total. If you have a sweet tooth this is the perfect go to. Brought some home and they tasted just as great the next morning.   Salsa Bar: I was impressed with the salsa bar. Normally the salsas are bland and made for the mass majority. That's not the case here, you can definitely find one that's spicy, medium, mild and have them still taste really good!   Would I ever come back? Yes! Authentic? Yes. Pricier then others? Yes.  Well worth it? Yes.   I have been going to Fausto's for almost 10 years now. It's the best fast food option for Mexican over others. I like it but if I'm ever near Taqueria Guadalajara then I'll definitely just go here."}
{"text":"Demand in our house hold for REAL Mexican food is high. Husband is from LA, Phoenix, and comes from down home Mexican cooking family. Myself, I look and need flavor, but not overwhelming heat. This place... The Mexican gods above smile down upon.  We've had a few Mexican places and living in a city that thinks great Mexican food is Pedro's.. We never thought we would find a place that reminded us of home cooking. TG hit it out of the park.  Chips and salsa given to us at the start were impressive on the salsa front. Mild with a bit of heat. Husband ordered the menudo, lengua tacos, and Horchata. All phenomenal. I ordered the green chili verde enchiladas. Everything was melt in your mouth with amazing flavor. Couldn't have been happier. Ran around $26 for everything. A steal.   Family is visiting in the fall and we will absolutely be bringing them here. And we will be going back again.. And again."}
{"text":"FINALLY! I found good carry-out mexican food in Madison. I usually go to La Hacienda out of old college day habits of seeking cheap cheap cheap mexican food. Lately, I've been seeking something better like I got used to while living in San Diego...Guadalajara was pretty close. I went to Francisco's first, but they were closed on Sundays (they did have a sign in the window \"$10 margarita pitchers\" so I have a feeling my straw and I will eventually try it out).  I got a burrito which was outstanding and only $6. My only complaints were that the cheese was melted on the exterior (making it hard to eat w/o a fork and knife), it was zapped in the microwave (unnecessary if the cheese was placed inside), and the lady was trying to be skimpy on the salsa (I wanted to try it all).   Everyone was speaking Spanish, it was extremely quick, the staff was very friendly, all the other food going out looked great, the place seemed clean despite its quirky late night drunken Cabo taco shop appearance and the salsa was really good in my opinion.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since moving from California.  And so far Taqueria Guadalajara is the best, hands down, of all the places we've tried.  We've been here twice.  On both visits we ordered the Burrito Mexicano, which is huge and has an excellent balance of meat, cheese, rice, and beans.  The salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on top (which helps create the colors of the Mexican flag) give it good additional flavor.  We've also ordered both times the tacos, which are also tasty--we've ordered the carne asada and pastor tacos.  Great meat flavor and greasy enough to add flavor but you won't have grease dripping down your arms.  We've also had the chicken and cheese tamales, which had good flavor but there wasn't a whole lot of filling inside (especially the cheese), and a sope with chicken, which was delicious with a thick corn tortilla that is crispy on the bottom but soft on top and delicious meat, again.  For our son, we ordered a kid's quesadilla which was alright.  The cheese wasn't melted, but I think they did that so that he didn't burn himself.  If that's the intention, then that was very nice of them.  Our son, as well as do I, loves the horchata, which is a sweet rice drink.  It was tasty and wasn't too thick with rice.  A little more cinnamon would be nice,  though.  And, to be honest, last time we went, I had read Brad R.'s review and was scared about getting food poisoning.  I probably hate being sick more than the average person, so I understand his warning.  However, as I let that thought leave my mind and focused on enjoying the food, I started to think: I'm sure that if you talk to enough people, you'll find someone who has gotten food poisoning or has had some horrible experience at EVERY restaurant there is.  If you want a surefire way to avoid food poisoning, you'll have to stay away from ALL hole-in-the-wall, but authentic places like this restaurant and go to Taco Bell or cook your own food and cook the hell out of everything.  Again, I believe Brad, and I feel bad for his experience, but at the same time, I think you've gotta have trust in a place and hope that you don't get sick."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Madison. Great prices. Good food.  We got a variety plate with roasted jalapeño that was so, so hot.  I couldn't believe a jalapeño could be that hot.  Horchata was amazing to cool it down."}
{"text":"Two weeks after visiting San Diego I'd been craving real Mexican food worse than I'd ever craved Chipotle previously. Came here with my buddy from SoCal to try to dwell the pain.  Carne asada burrito and horchata were quite good. Had I not been enlightened by the bliss that is San Diegon Mexican food, I'd probably give this 5 stars.   Neat atmosphere, you can see the whole kitchen from the \"bar\" area and it's in what appears to be an old house. I'll probably be back soon."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Madison. Better then la fuenta on the 92nd street in Milwaukee. Traditional Mexican. Expanded seating area in back."}
{"text":"The food was meh. The service was extremely slow. The times that I've come here I've often waited for at least 25 mins for my food to arrive at the table. That was horrendous. I understand the restaurant is usualy packed, but I don't understand why it takes that long for the kitchen to prepare the food."}
{"text":"This is considered one of the best taco places in Madison, and it is just that.  The best taco place in Madison, not the best I've had regrettably.   I decided to go outside \"the norm\" and ordered the cow tongue and intestine taco.   It was well cooked, garnished, and presented, but lacked taste.  Some foodies believe that to truly appreciate the taste of a meal you shouldn't season it, but I'm not them.  A pinch of salt would've carried this dish a long way.  I also decided to be adventurous and ordered the cactus huaraches and unfortunately I didn't like it.  Something felt amiss.  Maybe it's because it didn't have meat, but from perception alone I was hoping for a heartier feel after eating it.   Nonetheless, better than most taco places, but I miss my taco trucks."}
{"text":"Yep, this is definitely my favorite place in Madison for Mexican food. It's not only extremely good, it's consistently extremely good.  The place is pretty small, but I've only ever waited 2-3 minutes one time in all the times I've been there."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while now. The menu is pretty extensive. But the cashier/ owner will answer any questions you might have. I ordered the carne asada fries and they were yummy! Skinny French fries covered in refried beans, cheddar cheese, sour cream, guacamole, crispy edged pieces of carne asada and topped with queso fresco cheese. It was a huge plateful. I ate what was just maybe 1/5 and yet I was already full. The place was clean. I will definitely be going back again for something else on their menu sometime soon!"}
{"text":"As advertised. Excellent Mexican fare. Tremendous service and personality. Weekend soup specials worth the visit."}
{"text":"Nice local Mexican restaurant. Pricing is excellent, and I enjoy my usual pork chimichanga. Food is served fast and service is great every time. Only complaint is it can be awkward while paying or waiting for a table with the narrow walkway at the front."}
{"text":"Ravings on Yelp got me curious. So I finally went there with my beau to satisfy odd hour early evening hunger.  Um, not my type of authentic. Yes, it's cooked by very very friendly Mexican family, and I appreciated their service. But based on my backpack trip experience in Mexico, I'd prefer Mercardo Miramar tacos over this one.   What's authentic is the group of guys at the counter with beer, munching on food, and having small talks in between watching soccer game."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with authentic Mexican food this restaurant is a little bit of a let down. Food is filling and a good amount for what you pay for. One of the only Mexican restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Steak chimichanga is damn delicious! The cheese when you first cut into it is a work of art. The tacos are also very good. I like all the taco meat options. You can't go wrong with pastor or steak or chicken.   I just love this place. The service is fast, the chips and salsa hit the spot and the prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"I love this place! One of the BEST taco places in Madison. You can pick anything on their menu and it will be delicious! This is a great place to sample the menu with a friend."}
{"text":"I challenge you to find better Mexican food in Madison.   Just dined there since it's re-opening and it's only gotten better. Clearly they invested in the infrastructure. The salsa got even better and they will sell it if you want to put it on everything you have at home. (guilty)  It's authentic and flavorful. Squeeze limes on everything like its your job. Ask for more salsa because it's that delicious. The torta can easily feed two & is crisped to perfection. My partner in crime had the tacos and left none standing. Everyone was silent as they dined.   So glad you're back taqueria!  There isn't a lot of seating, so I'd be careful during peak hours. TOTALLY worth the wait. (And easy on your pocketbook!)"}
{"text":"Yes!  Finally, a Mexican place that is totally authentic. Went here to celebrate a new job three weeks ago. My kid raved about his burrito Mexicano, as did my fiancé. I got the chimichanga and was not disappointed at all.  Everything from the guac to the fillings was authentic. If you love Mexican food, come on in!  It's great!"}
{"text":"Local local local. We came here for a late lunch and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The food was authentic and the atmosphere was quaint. Expect to feel like you're eating in someone's living room. The menu had plenty of choices, but I was surprised to see there were no margarita choices. Luckily, we were planning on drinking. They did have some Mexican beer, if you're really needing an adult beverage."}
{"text":"If all you're concerned about is the food, then I would strongly recommend going. This place has excellent authentic Mexican cuisine at an incredibly reasonable price. It was even named by USA Today as one of the Top Ten Authentic Mexican Restaurants in the U.S. So the food is great!  If you're going for the whole dining experience, I would have second thoughts. The place isn't very nice, definitely a dive, and there isn't much seating at all. The waiter struggled with English, not that there is anything wrong with that, it just makes it difficult to get a good recommendation. Last but not least, the place isn't located in the greatest area, there is limited parking and they don't have a full bar."}
{"text":"The food is very good I love the salsa bar..... very good customer service fast and clean menudo in the weekend yummy I recommend habanero salsa"}
{"text":"Found this place searching up lunch in my work area and seen they're new so I definitely had to try them out and hands down-- BEST burrito I've ever had. It was huge and almost couldn't finish it (keep in mind that I have a B I G appetite). This place definitely surprised me! Upon entering I was greeted immediately by the cook over the counter grilling a heap of what looked like shredded chicken on the grill. First look the actual building itself looks dated- supposedly used to be a burger joint(?), but when you walk in you can tell the place was remodeled nicely and they definitely do a good job keeping the place very clean. The salsa bar was also very neat and I had the chance to try the guacamole and the reddest salsa there (which was pretty spicy).   I had previously ordered for pick-up and the man on the phone said it'd be ready in FIVE minutes.. So it definitely was ready when I approached.  It came out to about $7.52 after tax, and the lady who rang me up thrown in some tortilla chips which tasted homemade along with my heavy burrito.  I had the al pastor burrito (no beans) and it was phenomenal. You can tell the cook actually 'prepares' the food. Something most mexican 'fast food' restaurants I've been to ignore to do. The tortilla was actually slightly grilled on the bottom of the burrito to seal it nicely. The meat was well done and not runny at all. The Spanish rice was flavored nicely, and the pico de gallo tasted very fresh.   I know this was beyond in depth, but they deserve this 5 star review. Great job Taqueria Guadalajara. I'll be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality, probably the best taqueria in Henderson. I've had menudo everywhere you can get it in South Henderson (Faustos, Robertos, Cuevas, Don Tortaco, Santa Rosa), and these guys have the best - hands down. Also, it's the only taco shop that sells beer and the michelada was on point. Their prices are a little higher, but you get what you pay for. So, if you find yourself suffering from a hang over, you owe it to yourself to get a bowl of menudo and a beer from this place. I'll definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Take all my money in exchange for the closest thing I'll come to in Wisconsin for breakfast tacos.   Their service is surprisingly good for having such few staff. Those few staff are working their butts off though, boy howdy. If you know you'll want extra salsa, tell that to your server right when they give your table the first batch of chips and salsa. They always customize my weird requests like subbing out meat for an extra egg, instead of sunny side up, wanting scrambled, and getting the hot sauce on the side (confession: I'm a \"dipper,\" I'd prefer to dip my food into sauce rather than have it spread on my dish).   Come here if you want a delicious, legit Mexican-style dish and are willing to wait a little bit extra while you sip on coffee or a real sugar cane Coke and eat chips and salsa. Doooo it."}
{"text":"There is much to like about Taqueria Guadalajara 2.0: the service is efficient, the menu extensive and you get incredible bang for the buck.  I like but not love the food; there are sub-par elements of any meal juxtaposed against some near transcendent elements.  While not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, it is certainly in the conversation.  The Parrillada that my table ordered during my last visit to Taqueria Guadalajara exemplifies uneven performance of the kitchen.  This dish for four consists of various Mexican grilled meats, roasted potatoes, knob onions, deep-fried jalapeños and grilled cactus.  The steak and rib meat was superb, with a char on the exterior but not overcooked. The same goes for the slightly sweet knob onions, which helped balance out the pile of unctuous grilled meat.  And the oh-so-wonderful corn tortillas served on the side were thick, fresh and loaded with flavor.  On the flip side, the overcooked chorizo added a crunchy element the dish did not need.  The potatoes could provide that textural component if properly prepared, but instead, the limp, under-seasoned spuds seemed out of place, considering the generous pile of starchy Mexican rice served on the side.  The same study in contrasts occurs with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The bland, slightly stale tri-color chips seem out of place in a restaurant that serves such wonderfully fresh corn tortillas.  Taqueria Guadalajara serves two salsas with the chips.  The flavor-packed spicy version is expertly prepared while its milder sibling is a watery mess.  Once you get past the uneven performance of the kitchen, the performance of the restaurant shines.     The expansive menu offers a vast variety of choices, including numerous vegetarian options.  Adventurous eaters can dine on pig stomachs or beef intestines while the kid's menu gives you the ability to feed the bambinos when you elect to bring them along.  On weekends, the restaurant offers pozole and menudo.  The generous serving sizes mean you will be toting a doggy bag when departing the restaurant.  I have enjoyed top-notch treatment during my visits.  While not overly gregarious, the servers are cordial and efficient.  Even when slammed with customers, I always receive water and complimentary chips and salsa within a couple minutes of being seated.  Also appreciated is how the servers keep a keen eye on the chip basket.  When the chip level starts running low, the server will promptly ask if the table if they want a refill.   They also consistently perform other service basics liking checking in after they deliver the food and promptly removing dirty dishes.    For a mom-&-pop Mexican restaurant,  Taqueria Guadalajara gets a gold star for cleanliness.  The stainless steel open kitchen still gleans as it did when the restaurant reopened and the tabletops are always spotless.  The serving area is relatively small and there is scant space between the tables.  Eating during peak hours means it may be difficult to carry on a discussion with tablemates at conversational tones.  The dining room has the obligatory muted flat screen tuned to a Liga MX match or other Latin programming.   Pro tip:  When perusing past reviews, be aware that a completely remodeled Taqueria Guadalajara reopened on August 8, 2013 after a fire closed the restaurant for over six months.  You should discount any comments about the gritty nature of the eatery before that date.  So if you find yourself travelling the South Park Street corridor with a heavy appetite and a light wallet, do not hesitate to pay Taqueria Guadalajara a visit."}
{"text":"Love your tacos! Sill our favorite Mexican plan in Madison. Quick service. Great prices. Keep it up"}
{"text":"If you consider service, price, consistency, speed and quality of food, this is hands down the best restaurant in Madison. While it should not be mistaken for a high end affair, if your stomach is the final arbiter, you will feel like royalty when you stumble out the door and back on to Park Street. Required stop for visitors :)"}
{"text":"Ok, the burritos and tacos are good. The staff, however, is consistently rude and condescending. They look at you and grunt if you don't hurry up and choose quickly. On more than one occasion I've had the girl taking my order roll her eyes at me! So if you're ok with rude staff then you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Not as impressed as I wanted to be. I tried this place on two separate occasions because of the great yelp reviews and getting well ranked in the Annual Manual. I just wasn't a fan. Had tacos one time and huaraches the next but both times I felt it something was lacking."}
{"text":"I am basing this on one visit and usually like to visit multiple times before reviewing, but I'll give it a shot. When I go again, I'll update. I would probably have given it three stars, but I'd heard so many good things and I was disappointed, and I also always like to promote what I call Madison's triumvirate of awesome if lesser known Mexican places: Taqueria Guanajuato, La Hacienda, and Antojitos El Toril (technically in Monona, but that town is ours too :) ).  So all I got here were three gorditas containing three different meats. I haven't much more than this to say: all three of them were very standard, nothing that stood out positively in either the meats or the toppings stuffed in, and the ultra greasiness, like to the point of nigh-on immediate heartburn, stood out negatively.  I do understand that good and/or authentic Mexican is greasy, but not like this."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....I love love love this place!! I've been trying to find good enchiladas and chile relleno since I moved and came to Wisconsin and they have both. The food was hot and fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. My husband enjoyed the steak tacos. They give you two types of salsa with tortilla chips when you are seated ...one was very hot but both were tasty. Qdoba, Chipotle are fast food compared to this place and I can't even go in those places with a straight face after going to this Taqueria. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Very good. Good service. Authentic Mexican fare. Very, very casual.  Ignore the 2star reviews and just go. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Hola. Los burritos de taquería Guadalajara los Recomiendo mucho. Sus salsas están muy sabrosas especialmente la de chipotle, cualquier hispano que viva o trabaje en el área de henderson taquería Guadalajara es buena Restaurante para comer o cenar, es comida como echa en casa muy al estilo Guadalajara. Yo recomiendo Taquería Guadalajara. Gracias."}
{"text":"I love this place! I moved to Madison from New Mexico, so I was understandably mourning the loss of my favorite Mexican restaurants back home. I can't say it's as good as those old favorites (hence 4 stars rather than 5), but it's consistently good, and you can't beat the prices. I've had every vegetarian item on the menu, and have been pretty happy with all of them. Their tortillas are fantastic, and I highly recommend the horchata."}
{"text":"Back and better than ever!  How do you take an already solid place and make it more remarkable? A new sleek space.  New furniture!  New paint! Stunning... I'm talking stunning stainless steel! A really cool storefront that's a bajillion times better than the old.   But what hasn't changed?   Still (in my opinion) the most authentic Mexican joint we have in Madison. It's meat on a corn tortilla. With some pico and cilantro. That's what I ate for 7 years, I'm thrilled to keep the tradition alive, and I haven't found anything better in the 608. (People try though... why does everyone want to convince me to keep looking?)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Madison has real Mexican food! And Guadalajara does it well. Cheap prices, cane sugar sodas, Mexican cable channel blaring, an open kitchen so you can actually see them cooking your food, and a friendly atmosphere. We ordered lunch to go and it was delicious. Their house marinated pork is AMAZING. The chicken enchiladas are also very tasty. Guadalajara is also open quite late, which is great if you ever get those late night munchies.  The waitress also seemed incredibly capable and on top of things. I see a lot of complaints about the service of this place, but I was honestly impressed. Considering the restaurant was kinda packed, we received great service for being to go customers. We were greeted with a friendly welcome, and she even gave us chips and salsa while we were waiting to take home our order. I usually don't tip when I get take out, but I couldn't help it after seeing the waitress handle everything so swiftly and elegantly. I guess I just have a soft spot for hard-working, capable waitresses :)  I didn't get to try the tamales this time, but I saw some people buying them by the gallon-size bag and they looking delicious. I'll have to get tamales next time..."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Reminds me of the restaurants in California. The tacos are packed with meat and the burritos are huge! Everything has great flavor. I'm looking forward to trying the menudo on a weekend. Don't hesitate to go here, you will leave stuffed and wondering when is the next time you can go back. Warning the salsas are spicy, but hey that's how they are supposed to be!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  Reasonably priced.  Quick.  Must try.  Would go everyday if i could.  I believe they serve beer as well.  Try the chimichanga.  Best Burritos around."}
{"text":"Mahogany high-backs, salsas x 5, and cheap, nummy lunch deals. Yup, they bring you as many salsas, just for sitting down, as there are A's in Guadalajara.  What it isn't: high-quality ingredients. What it is: almost free from Tex-Mex super-flavorful Taqueria that also does Tortas, Chilaquiles, Chile Rellenos, etc. There were Fajitas, so that's the almost. I had slighty-angry belly later that day, which is the no-high-qual.  There's so much good food lining this road that the small lunch crowd we were part of made sense, I guess. Still, the flavors are solid, Chilaqulies done right - crisp but soaked (and part of a combo so I could have an enchilada or Relleno too!! first for me!), fried egg on the side. They drew a smiley face with Crema on 'em for me.   I like you guys too."}
{"text":"I had their super burrito with grilled chicken.   The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful.   The burrito was huge and very filling.   Restaurant staff was very courteous and helpful.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Came here for lunch last weekend and everything was wonderful...the food and service! The salsa is yummy and the servers don't seem to mind when you ask for more tortilla chips.  They were also very helpful in making sure that we had vegetarian food and were great about making substitutions. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"Went there again and the refried beans did not taste like I remembered. I think they changed up the recipe. Everything else was still solid though."}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite restaurant in Madison, anything you order here is going to be great."}
{"text":"Food wasnt hot when we got it,slow service, store bought chips (stale) with salsa. Taste of food was decent but definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"I moved to the midwest from southern california and on a cold day felt like having Mexican food. It took a few minutes to get seated, a good sign. It was Southern California style, although my food could have been hotter. The tacos were okay, but I'd probably try something else next time. Their horchata came from a mix, but they added some spices, and it was good. Friendly staff, and things moved quickly, but were didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"Found a toothpick in my chimichanga (bit into it and have a cut in my mouth), this is second time it has happened to myself and a member of my party on two separate occasions. The staff didn't seem to care when I brought it to their attention. The food is good but not sure it's worth the health risk."}
{"text":"Es buen restaurante. Lo recomiendo. Dan un excelente servicio y la comida esta genial."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. This place is authentic. Don't settle for any of the chain \"Mexican\" restaurants. The prices are cheap too."}
{"text":"I didn't have the same experience as all these rave-reviews.  The food came fast and the wait staff were polite but the food was distinctly average and bland.  Not good or bad, just meh. I've had better and will likely go elsewhere for my next Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"Incredible Mexican food. Very authentic and delicious. It gets very crowded but the line goes pretty quick. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went in last Thursday night with another couple. Had very quick and friendly service. I got the mole enchiladas which were excellent and filled me up. Tried the beef tongue taco that my friend got and it was extremely juicy and flavorful. For great food and awesome service I highly recommend Taqueria Guadalajara. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place opened not far from our house in Henderson.. family and I decided to give them a try.. so glad we did!! We had the tacos carnitas, lengua and cabeza de res being from Texas we were glad see these items on the menu!! We definitely will be back and support a local business!"}
{"text":"So happy I stopped in! With places that serve \"authentic Mexican food\" it gets tiring trying to find a good spot in town. This place is totally hidden, but so worth it. They have a pretty extensive menu, different choices for different tastes- seafood, chicken, al pastor, carne asada, head, tongue. It's so good. They're on the pricier side - made us a bit apprehensive to try, but man, do it! I ordered nachos with cabeza. They were super prompt. My food was hot, looked phenomenal and made my mouth absolutely water. The chips were made in house- crisp not greasy and crunchy. The meat was cooked perfectly and they featured 3 types of cheese. They were so yummy. Seriously go to taqueria Guadalajara- it's boooomb."}
{"text":"The real thing- a hole in the wall type of place with delicious food that is very reasonably priced.  And it's open until 11.  Yum."}
{"text":"Taqueria Guadalajara on Park has some huge positives going for it, which will certainly bring me back, but on the occasion of my first visit there were a few things that were less than stellar. I could see TG regularly hitting a 4 star review and occasionally even a 5 star, but this was my experience today:  Chips and salsa: These were really disappointing. The chips seemed undercooked and were a little leathery. I came in with my son and we were given very few chips. When we asked for more we got another very small basket. The salsas were pretty good (especially the hot), but again the quantities were very limited. I'd happily pay a bit more for enough chips and salsa to enjoy rather than having to ask over and over for very small batches.   Burrito Mexicana (w/ Carne asada): The burrito was a good size and the guacamole on top was pretty tasty, but that was all of the good. The carne asada had a nice texture, but it was pretty flavorless. A little salt and lime could have gone a LONG way here. There was WAY too much lettuce inside and no enough of everything else. There was also a LOT of tortilla relative to the size of the overall burrito, but fortunately the tortilla was quite good.   Lomo de puerco in salsa verde: Overall this was my favorite dish of the day. I was hoping for something close to chili verde (which this is NOT), but I enjoyed what I was served nonetheless. The salsa verde has a really good taste, but was a little on the thin side. I also enjoyed the grilled onion served with dish, that added a lot. The pork loin was sliced very thinly and seared pretty hard on the flat top, so it was a little dry. The rice and beans on the side were a nice compliment, and the corn tortillas were excellent! In fact, the corn tortillas may have been the single best thing I had during the entire visit.   The best thing about TG is the authenticity of the food. There are a number of other dishes I'm excited to try that I think could benefit from this exact authenticity. It's also nice that TG is VERY affordable, but as I mentioned above I'd be okay paying just a bit more for a few things to be a little better. Parking can also be a bit of a chore, but I was lucky and got a spot right out front. The service was very good, and the space is fairly comfortable, albeit slightly on the smaller side. I expect to update this review in the future, but for this particular visit I'd say TG was about a three star stop."}
{"text":"I had to used the Eat Street service because I couldn't get out for lunch and was hungry for Mexican food.  I had never been to Taqueria Guadalahara before so I was a little scared about what I might get.  I ordered the Enchiladas Mole with cheese and it was fantastic and exactly what I wanted.  It came with refried beans, Mexican rice and a little wedge of lime was a nice touch.  Sour cream and fresh avocado were extra, but at .35-.40 cents each, it was well worth it.   Loved it!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Madison for the Great Midwest Beer Fest and prior to getting in line for the opening we headed west a bit and via Yelp landed in this little Taqueria.  From the front it almost looks too small to dine-in as there are no tables and just a small counter.  But the server will lead you back, literally through the kitchen, to the dinning area in the back of the restaurant.  As we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't spend too much time searching the menu, quickly selecting a torta.  Our server brought some colored chips and two types of salsas; the chips were good but the salsa was nothing great.  The torta on the other hand was excellent, the steak was juicy and had a hint of grilled, smoky flavor.  The sandwich was huge and was more food then needed (had to save room for 5 hours worth of beer sampling)."}
{"text":"Drove two hours to this place. because someone said it was good The food was terrible, I have a lousy waitress with a bad attitude. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The (very few) negative reviews on here are a joke.  This place is awesome.  We've had a number of their tacos and burritos and all have been excellent.  The service can be a little slow on the weekends, but only because they make everything from scratch.  It's well worth the wait.  We also went on a weeknight and had our food within 5 minutes, so it just depends on when you go.  A great addition to the limited food options in older Henderson."}
{"text":"Stopped by said they just opened 4 days ago and it's close to my work. Everything I ordered was fresh made and tasted excellent..tacos were flavorful, one of the best tacos I've had. I liked the salsa bar great choices and fresh flavors..and xxxxxx- hot slasa which I love. I hope this location lasts because everything else has failed there. Go check them out you might be surprised..and a bonus they have Coke products! If they get busy they might wanna increase the staff had to wait a bit but all my stuff was made fresh and they are new..will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.  Clean and affordable.  I had the carne asada and pastor Tacos and a side of Orden de cebollitas cambray.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the taco meat had been better seasoned.  The pastor was not bad, but the steak was very bland.  Everyone I was with seemed pleased with their meal and my husband said we could come back for sure (he is kind of picky). He had the steak quesadilla plate."}
{"text":"Delicious and very well-priced!  When my boyfriend and I visited this place we both had the equivalent of two meals, plus our daughter also had her own tacos, and the total came out to be less than $30 - including the tip!  Not to mention that the food was better than anything else we've had in the Madison area!  I had the chicken mole enchiladas and it was beyond delicious.  As soon as the waitress was walking up to our table I smelled the spices and thought I was smelling something out of a bakery!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Very authentic and great prices!  I had the chicken chimichanga which was awesome. It came with rice, beans, and pico on the side and it was plenty of food for one person.  My friends had the beef tacos and they also looked amazing with just the right amount of cilantro. Just make sure you ask for cheese if you like cheese on tacos like I do. I would defiantly eat here again and for the cheap price why not!"}
{"text":"Mi amor...how did I not review you earlier, Guadalajara? Have been going here since it first opened and it's really exciting to see it flourish!  Chips are now served with both a mild red salsa and a quite hot green salsa.  The tacos and gorditas are the best with either steak (carne) or carnitas (pork), in my opinion.  The gorditas are just steaming hot pockets of deliciousness with refried beans, meat, and cheese.  They do have some vegetarian options on their menu as well.  The guac is the one item that's kind of \"eh\" since it's overly pureed rather than with big chunks.  If you have a group of 4-5, you can order the parrillada, which is an assortment of sausage crumbles, pork al pastor, thinly sliced potatoes, and green onions& potatoes.  All of this is served with rice, beans, guacamole, pepper mix, and tortillas, and it'll feed a crowd!  Love going here, always satisfied with the food, and it's great to see the same friendly faces when you go."}
{"text":"Tried this on a dare.  An awesome \"little hole in the wall\" place.  A very small place that offers an abundance in variety of hispanic foods.  This has to be one of the best Mexican restaurants I have visited here in Madison.   Staff is great and food comes fast.     You are not there for the ambiance...its all about the food.  This is a must try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Qualifications:  Resident of San Diego for 4 years, frequenter of Taco Shops.  Quick synopsis:  Highly Recommended, great food great prices.  Will go back soon.  We had a group of 4 total, one of which is an 11 month old baby, for lunch around 1:30 on a Saturday.  We sat at a table pretty quickly however the 2 baby seats were taken.  By the time were were leaving every available seat was taken.  To start they brought out some chips and salsa.  The chips were regular but the salsa's were home made and fantastic.  There was a red and a picante.  I bought a cup of the picante for $4 to take home, it was pretty much the perfect spiciness.    Between us all we order Chile Relleno, Taco Dinner, Veggie Sopa, Chicken Enchilada, and a Chicken Taco.  My order was the Relleno and for $7 I couldn't expect anything more.  Rice, re-fried beans, lettuce, tomato, the chile, and 5 corn tortillas.  I was really stoked on the tortillas because usually a place only gives you like 2.  Everything on the dish was very good.  I was actually really surprised on how tasty the chile was.  It came with a \"traditional red sauce\" on it that complimented it really nicely.  I am a pretty big eater and was satisfied after I was done.    My baby had the chicken taco for $2.  She can't talk but we are pretty sure she loved it.  We were really happy that there was something so simple on the menu we could offer her.  I finished off what she didn't eat and I thought the shredded chicken had a great flavor and was tender.  My wife got the taco dinner that came with beans and rice.  It came with 2 tacos carne and pork.  She said she really liked the carne but the pork was pretty standard.  She wanted to specifically note that the tortillas were fantastic, I agree.  Mother in law got the Sopa ($3) and Enchilada ($7).  I had a bite of each.  I haven't eaten too much sopa but it was absulutely delishes, I like to call it an open faced tamale.  Her burrito was covered in a green sauce that had quite a nice flavor, you could really taste the pepper in it.  MIL said they were really good and the value for the price was excellent.  I wish I could give out fractions of stars because I don't really like giving out 5 unless it totally blows me away.  I would give them at least 4.5 though.  It exceeded our expectations, which started high, and the prices were very good.  The dining area isn't very large so if you have a big group I would probably stay away.  But for a family I think it was perfect.  Nice moderate ambient noise to keep baby happy and great food for dad."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. I've driven past this place over 100 times, so I thought with the reviews it's received, I'd try it out. Not too impressed. I had the Super chicken burrito, free chips/salsa, and a can of Diet Coke. Without the chips being complementary, I would've given this place 2 stars.   The burrito wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Like others have said, it's HUGE. Then again, so are most other \"taco shops\" in Vegas. The difference here, is it was very tasteless. Everything blended in to a blah tasting mess of ingredients. No flavor in MY burrito.  Another complaint, is not that they only have cans of coke products(not fountain), but that they charge about $1.50 a can. That's frigen crazy. There could charge $.50-$.75 a can, and still make a profit. $1.50 is what you usually pay for unlimited fountain soda.  The chips were just ok. They have to be from a bag, and not made in restaurant. Most mexicans places in Vegas either make their own or serve mexican-restaurant style chips vs these Tostito's type chips.  Their salsa \"bar\" was good, and even though it had more options than Roberto's or Don's, I actually like Baja Fresh and Rubio's salsa and salsa selections WAY better.  All in all, I'm not saying I wouldn't eat here again, and will probably give it another shot to try out something else... but if it's the same again, I'd probably just drive 6ish blocks away to Roberto's from there on.."}
{"text":"I used to live practically across the street from this place, and finally went one balmy summer night.  It's really good food, and great service - especially at such reasonable prices!  It really is a hole in the wall.  There are a couple of tables jammed in with a lunch counter, so it's definitely a place for small groups.  There is also a porch for a few extra tables in the back, which is great for warm summer nights.  If you're sitting at the counter, you can watch the cook prepare your meal right in front of you."}
{"text":"If I want to get tacos or a burrito in Madison this is the place I go. The place is small and can have a wait sometimes but if you ask me that's how you know it's good. The burritos are more than enough food to satisfy most anyone and the tacos come in a ton of varieties. And of course why not wash everything down with a Mexican Coca-Cola!   You might have to walk a block or so after you park but it is more than worth it."}
{"text":"This is the real deal restraunt. Home cooked food with a home felt decor. The $2 tacos are out of this world and very affordable. I'm happy to frequent this restraunt often."}
{"text":"Taqueria Guadalajara was a great place for Mexican food. We met some friends for dinner. The seating area is fairly small, but the restaurant has a good ambiance. Our waiter didn't do much for us, other than taking orders and bringing the food. He didn't check back with us once. We received 3 out of 4 plates at one time, then the last plate a few minutes later. My friend also ordered soup and our waiter did not bring the soup until later on, despite having brought the soup toppings with the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Small, but awesome! We've been here a couple of times now. Had the carne asada, chicken, carnitas and empenadas. Everything was great! Super nice people that own it. Service might be a little slow, but not too bad, but that's because they make everything fresh. Highly HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"I found this place by just driving down Park Street,  looking for tacos, as one does on the weekends.    Everything they were taking out to other tables as I waited looked really good and smelled amazing.  But my food was not anything to write home about.  I got the 2 pastor taco meal with beans and rice,  and an extra taco-- because I wanted to try the lengua. The pastor was really bland.  In my opinion,  if I have to add avocado, a ton of lime,  etc. to the taco to make it taste halfway decent, it's probably not a good taco.  The lengua taco was eh. I've had good lengua before,  and this had an old beef taste-- like it sat in the fridge thawing too long before it was cooked kind of taste.   I ended up just scooping up beans and rice with chips and left my tacos to be tossed.  I expected better,  since they had a couple best of Madison framed certificates up on the wall. Sadly,  I probably won't be returning to try anything else. If the tacos are blah,  I can't see the more complex dishes being much better."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place one night a few weeks ago so we tried Taqueria Guadalajara. The tacos are amazing and very large, pork el pastor and carne asada are my favorite so far. This was my second time eating here and it was better than the last. This place really knows authentic Mexican food. The restaurant is very clean and well kept. The staff is very friendly and brings your food to you at the table, they are really nice people. I read on their Instagram page that they originated in the Bay Area where is also where I grew up, In my opinion this place is far above Roberto's and the rest of the taquerias you see all over town. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Still haven't dropped the ball. Been going here for years now. Mi Ranchero is my favorite, Chorizo, Steak, Grilled Cactus and whole grilled onions. It brings back memories of Oaxaca, warm nights & Modelo Negro."}
{"text":"This is one of those true Yelp success stories.  I grew up mostly in Madison but lived in Milwaukee for a number of years where Mexican food is ridiculously good.  Whether it be from one of the amazing restaurants on the Southside or the authentic Mexcian grocers (El Ray), you really can't go wrong.  Up until I went to Taqueria, I hadn't run into a restaurant in Madison that I would even deem \"acceptable\" for Mexican food.  There's a few places that were decent, but nothing that ever stuck out or that had all the right stuff put together.  Each place lacked either taste, proper pricing, or variety on their menu.  Well Taqueria Guadalajara solves that issue ten-fold in my opinion.  They are pretty much just what others describe here; a very very small mom & pop operation with a comfortable environment and amazing food at good prices.  Portion sizes are also quite generous.  The staff is polite and the TV usually has either soccer or mexican soap operas on, adding to the authentic vibe.  The food needs to be emphasized here though, they have some fantastic options.  First off, the chips and salsas are tasty, they give you a hot blend which I found enjoyable and a mild blend which is has a very traditional taste (cilantro, tomatoes, etc).  Make sure though that you order Guacamole, even if it takes them a while to bring it out.  Their fresh homemade Guac is out of this world, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like Guacamole.  I have to put it on everything I get here though, as it's just that delicious.  Secondly, there are a few main dishes I've had worthy of note.  I'd say the best deal they offer are the tacos, my girlfriend got 2-3 tacos each time with a side, and I think they were about $1.75 or $2 per taco.  This isn't something from taco bell though, these are flavorful and fulfilling jam-packed tortillas, and if you get a side of rice and / or beans it should be more than enough food.  Some of my other favorites, albeit pricey, are the Mexican flag burrito and the Tortas (Mexican Sandwhiches) with slow-roasted pulled pork.  I'd rate one meat over the other, but the Carne Asada, the el pastor pulled pork, and the chicken were all mouth-watering.  Just make sure you wash it down with one of their many beers / sodas available.  Nobody's perfect, so there are a few minor qualms.  The service is terribly slow and inattentive.  They make up for it with warm hospitality, but we often had to wait for drink / chip refills to the point where we had finished the main course and usually had to wait a while to put in our order.  That said, they do get the main courses out promptly, the last time I went I had my meal in less than ten minutes.  Only thing is, we've seen this behavior when we went at 8pm at night on a weekday, so I have no idea how it is when they're packed.  My girlfriend said she went for lunch and it was crazy-crowded (she still got her food though).  Overall, Taqueria is a slice of delight in an unexpected location."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good authentic Mexican place in Madison, but for the price here, it is pretty good.  The mole was not very impressive, but I usually try to avoid mole made in the Midwest.  However, the enchiladas verdes were tasty and came in a good portion for the price."}
{"text":"The expansion in the back of the restaurant looks great.  They did a really good job and added a nice amount of tables so you're not waiting too long but at the same time the small kitchen isn't overburdened with too many tables.  Food is still great."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places! I love street tacos, and this place is solid. I honestly can't speak to anything else other than their tacos! Cheap and good!"}
{"text":"We tried the cactus dish, burrito and quesadillas. Everything was well prepared. Love the also sauce they serve with nacho chips  I like the open concept kitchen"}
{"text":"Mexican patrons lining up outside a Mexican place is always a good sign. The place is a hidden gem in Wisconsin. It doesn't show up on most internet top ten lists, but most residents know about the place.   I had a pork chimichanga for $7. When they say stuffed with meat, it was stuffed!! They did not shortchange me. The same item in a fancier setting would be at least $20. It was a little greasy, but hey, it is a deep fried burrito.   The spicy salsa is good. But do ask for gauc. It was very well done. I also tried a Jarritos which is supposed to be a Mexican soda. I went with lime though most people recommend the tamarind. My partner had the chicken enchiladas which was flavorful."}
{"text":"After living in San Diego for 7 years and eating at virtually every taco shop in SD county, I know what constitutes a good taco.   Taqueria Guadalajara whips up some legitimately GOOD tacos, especially the al pastor. In the last 2 weeks, I have been probably 5 times and have tried carne asada tacos and al pastor tacos. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but I am confident it is all delicious.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"We had a really good dinner here and will definitely be back. It is a small place, but there is seating in the back, so do try it. We were there early and got right in, but it was filling up by the time we left. I had the chicken enchiladas verde and my dining companion had the burrito mexicana. Prior to our entrees they brought us chips and two different salsas. I am a fan of heat, so I loved them both, but the hotter of the two maybe too intense for some. Our dinners came with rice and beans, and they there both delicious! Everyone that waited on us was pleasant and cordial. After we got there we noticed they prefer cash because of the service charge, and I felt bad we only had a card. Note to self next time bring cash. I love frequenting local places, and this is one we will definitely be back to. Tasty, flavorful food and good prices."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Madison (well chimichanga, at least!). I love the green salsa and the chicken chimichanga. Perfect hole-in-the-wall family-owned  kind of atmosphere; everyone is super nice. Highly recommended.  Only downfall is no margaritas!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican in Madison.  If you are up for a divey delicious and reasonably priced Mexican fix...this is your place.  Parking is a bit of a challenge but well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food. Stopped in one night not too long ago.. The place was packed! Thought we would have to wait for a table, but they were able to get a spot almost immediately! They were out of Tamales which made me really sad :( But what I got instead was fantastic. Service was great - they were quick and attentive but not over the top."}
{"text":"Does not live up too its name! I have traveled all over the world and that includes Guadalajara MX, where the food is amazing!! some would call me a bit of a Food Snob. The food was over priced and wasn't very tasty. They had no limes or radish's there salsa game needs a lot of help tried all they had and everyone of them were sour and made the food taste worst. Which with so called Mexican food the salsa should compliment the food not make it worst. Giving this place there well earned two stars due to they did marinate there meats I had. Which is more then most do places do. But not enough to make me come back again. This used be a burger joint which was so so. But this place I don't think will be open very long. So (Real Mexican) food lovers you have been Warned!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface my comments that this 5-star rating is based on best of class.  This eatery is not a white-table establishment, rather a hole-N-wall red and white checked table cloth kinda place...   I rate the food 5-star, the unique Mole sauce for enchiladas is unique and not an everyday experience... The average bill is about $10 a person.  They take credit cards but prefer cash...   Bottom line, great food at quality prices..."}
{"text":"I was kinda scared to try a new taco place honestly this is probably the best taco place in phoenix, due to the location I didn't expect it to be as clean as it was. I'm very impressed. The carne asada tacos were wonderful, not full of lard. They have a salad bar with different type of salsa that is fresh!!! This is our new taco joint!!!"}
{"text":"TG has risen from the ashes and spread it's wings. New front room, bigger kitchen but same good stuff. Try a bunch of tacos ($2) and a couple of sopes (a $3 pile of awesome) if you like but the steak Platillo Guadalajara ($10) is my favorite. Wash it down with a couple of Negra Modelos and walk away a fan muy contento."}
