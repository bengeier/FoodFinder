{"text":"By far one of the best and healthiest restaurants in the city, every gym in Montreal should have a Bistro Fit in it.    Try the sweet potato shepherds pie or the great all day breakfast.  If you work in the neighborhood, great place to grab a quick and satisfying lunch fix.  Better (and healthier) than anything else around."}
{"text":"The burger's quite nice and you can quote me on this, the thick x-lean patty is actually tastier, better seasoned, and easier to chew than a lot of the burgers dites \"gourmet\" in this city. Prices comparable to health-conscious chains downtown.  And of course, the staff and everyone around you are driven and fit people who also workout at the gym so the vibe is great. I'm starting to believe in this Fitness City concept.  Every rep is a step to your best."}
{"text":"Perfect healthy option in a cavernous gym...though you don't have to enter the actual gym to access the Bistro.  Pay by the pound options with pre made sandwiches and a huge variety of healthy shakes. I'm always on the road and looking for healthy food options that are easy... This solves that problem perfectly!"}
