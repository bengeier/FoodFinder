{"text":"A bit out of the way but a small price to pay for, by far, the best gluten free baked goods I've come across. We tried their baguette, some kind of a country loaf, wraps, some hamantash, a cherry pie, and of course the bagels, and all were outstanding. Not just gluten free, but top-7 allergen free (not everything, but a large amount of what they sell), and very open to doing special orders to accommodate requests."}
