{"text":"Great pizzaz but the subs are the best treat!"}
{"text":"I've been getting my takeout pizzas from Bardeco for over a decade, and have occasionally dined in, and Tara F.'s first paragraph nails this place.  They've gone through a few patches of inconsistency, and seem to have chronic trouble keeping staff, but they're firing on all twelve cylinders these days.  The video poker machines are gone, the salty peanuts are back, and the Lolo Brigidas (like an all-dressed on amphetamines) have never tasted better.    The garden veggie was always a winner, too, back in the day, but I haven't eaten one in a few years, because the Lolo's had me wrapped around its crust for so long.  And the El Gringo would be a killer pizza in any other setting, but the Lolo's absurd richness and color kicks it into the corner.  If you're on your way to a party or movie night in Lachine or western Lasalle, and you need to be bringing a pizza...they've got your pie."}
{"text":"OMG I miss this place.  Best Pizza in Montreal.  I think the worst moment in my life was when the Pizza fell off the plate.  The restaurant was a little run down and I didn't like the pizza tray because it is \"raised\" and the last 2 slices fell off but definitely worth the visit if you a pizza lover like me."}
