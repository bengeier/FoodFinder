{"text":"This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Cleveland. I'm a vegetarian(though I admit I'll still eat seafood) and this place had a ton of extremely delicious options for my boyfriend(a vegetarian who does not eat seafood) and I to try. We shared everything and were very pleased with everything we picked:  Guacamole / pineapple / jicama / chile habanero / mint- Extremely delicious starter, but be prepared for it to make you insanely full, we didn't even come close to finishing it.  Chile poblanao relleno / smoked gouda / chile guajillo / tomato sauce- The best chile relleno I have ever eaten in my life, the smoked gouda was a fantastic touch to spice up an old favorite.  Butternut squash + goat cheese empanadas / oaxacan red chili + chocolate mole- Absolutely wonderful, the squash and goat cheese blended perfectly with the semi sweet mole sauce.  Remolacha / roasted beets + spinach / spiced peanuts / chihuahua cheese- This the was entree we split and the beets were roasted to perfection, since we were splitting the server went ahead and brought us extra tortillas without us having to ask, big plus in my book!  Spicy Mango Margarita- You burn my mouth in the most delicious way! I am obsessed with spicy food and cocktails and this one hit the perfect balance of sweet and spice for me.    I really hope I get an opportunity to dine here again before I leave Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I sincerely miss!  I often find myself craving their food, and they amazing drinks.  I love this place."}
{"text":"I have only been here once for just one reason- the food was decent but in my opinion extremely overpriced. Not only that, the wait was ridiculous! The fact is that in Cleveland it is exceptionally difficult to find anything resembling good Mexican food (that isn't Taco Bell or Chipotle). If you're willing to shell out a pretty penny for some guac and margaritas feel free to go here, but I'd honestly rather make my own at home."}
{"text":"Of course this place gets 5 stars. Great happy hour, great prices, great anytime. Only regret: It's really, really hard to get a reservation."}
{"text":"GROSS!!!  A couple of friends and I were enjoying the taquitos, when one of them asked me what the dark spot on his tortilla was... the tortilla was spotted with furry blue-green MOLD.  Oddly, he had already eaten one of the 'spotted' tortillas, thinking they were a specialty.  It was pretty darkly lit in there.  When he showed the tortilla to the bartender, she agreed it was gross and then joked that she \"hoped he enjoyed his last meal.\"  She tossed the moldy tortilla in the trash can and then said nothing about it again.    Without a word, we collectively decided against ordering entrees.    I'm just wondering how long those tortillas sat in the warmers?  And also, if the Bartender bothered to tell the chef about the food being served.   The margarita were pre-made.  They are poured from gallon jugs.  After questioning the food's freshness, we were left questioning the drinks."}
{"text":"Can't say enough fabulous things about this place! Great food, good service, and killer margaritas. The happy hour is one of the best in Cleveland, though space is very limited. I would recommend Momocho and any of Eric's restaurants to anyone."}
{"text":"A. Mazing.  We wanted a Saturday night reservation, and all that was available was the chef's table.  I thought this involved a tasting menu, and wasn't too keen on the idea.  But at Momocho, the chef's table is just a couple seats at bar height that look into the kitchen.  You get to chat with the chefs and watch all the magic.  I was nervous at first, because it was Saturday night slammed, and these two chefs were cooking for the whole restaurant in a tiny space.  I didn't want to interrupt them.  But Damon and Justin were fantastic.  They didn't mind answering all our questions, about the preparations, ingredients, flavors, equipment, everything.  And we even got free tastes when we just inquired about something.  About the actual food: I'm not even a big Mexican fan, so I was impressed that I was so pleased.  We got way too much of everything.  Note - the guacamole sampler is too much food for two people.  Either taste and then pack it away quickly, or just settle on one.  If you like blue cheese, that one was scrumptious.  The jicama pineapple, which is supposed to be the spiciest, wasn't too hot for me, and I'm a bit of a wuss.  But don't waste your time on traditional guac.  The margaritas were all delicious (we tried four different ones), but believe them about the cucumber.  I was skeptical; I was wrong.  My date proclaimed the mole pork chop to be the best pork chop he had ever eaten.  I enjoyed the pumpkin seed crusted trout, but the sofrito green beans were the best part.  Delicious melt in your mouth garlic flavor.  We got a taste of the fried balls of cauliflower, hominy, and corn - I would eat a plate of these and nothing else any day.  So sweet and yet crunchy salty fried.  The red pepper sauce they come with was smooth and tangy, but finishes with a good punch of heat, so beware.  There was no way we could fit any dessert, so we decided to give up.  But then we were graced with a chocolate cream dessert, thanks to Damon.  I wasn't even interested in it, but the subtle mixture of chocolate cream, salt, and ancho chile powder was phenomenal.  All in all, a tremendous night out.  I can't stop raving about it.  The service was exceptional, despite the fact that it was a busy Saturday night.  The food was all tasty and some downright amazing.  And I highly recommend sitting at the chef's table if you enjoy talking and learning about food.  It was dinner and entertainment all in one.  And all of this food and booze (with ungodly amounts of chips and guacamole, plus half my entree, leftover), for just around $50 per person.  What a value.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends on a Saturday night.  The restaurant itself is very small and only accommodates a small crowd of people.  So if you plan on going here during the weekend, it would be smart to make a reservation.  Anyway, the atmosphere is modern/contemporary with a Mexican flare.  There are two floors.  The first floor has a reception area, bar and a few booths.  The main seating area is upstairs, along with the kitchen.  Upstairs there is just enough room.  My party sat down and ordered the guacamole sampler.  It was delicious.  Out of all three selections, the blue crab was the best.   For dinner I had scallops.  The scallops were done just right, however were slightly over seasoned (salty).  This is why the review is 4 star."}
{"text":"The margaritas, guacamole, tamales and taquitos are the BEST I've ever had.   To the people complaining about the authenticity of this cuisine must be blind & deaf, as Momocho has made its \"mod mex\" approach very clear.   Eric Williams, we are not worthy (bows down)."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago decided to try based on the DD&D recommendation. Loved the ambiance but found the drinks and meal very average compared to many Chicago-area Mexican restaurants. Had the smoked trout guacamole which was decent but lacked any kick. Had the spicy mango margarita which was too sweet. Later noticed the bartender pouring margaritas from what appeared to be jugs of concentrate. Split the coffee brisket dish and tinga chicken with a friend. The brisket was very good, very tender and flavorful. Our waiter was a bit of a d-bag; very impersonable; not at all friendly.  Don't believe I will return if back in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal: I adore just everything about it. The atmosphere is both intimate and yet energetic, with warm colors, creative lighting, and comfortable seating. When it's open, the patio is a pure delight: warm \"Christmas\" lights wrapped along the fence, plants, and a comfortable distance between tables. You feel like you're in your own private oasis, but from which you can enjoy people-watching in Ohio City. Elegant and low-key. Really hip feeling without being trendy. They've got a great collection of art too.  The drinks. Can I just say that the cucumber chili margarita is literally the best margarita I've ever had? The balance of flavors is just sublime. Get it by the glass rather than by the pitcher (sitting in ice waters it down too much). Their other drinks are great too, but you will dream about this margarita.   This same creativity is carried over to the creative guacamoles. Again, every single one of these is delicious and clever, but not *too* clever: the balance of flavors is just spot on. I especially love the guacamole / garlic confit / bleu cheese / chile verde and the guacamole / goat cheese / tomato / chile poblano. The portions are extremely generous: parties of four have a hard time finishing the sampler of 3 guacs.   The rest of the food is as delicious as the appetizers. The chile poblanao relleno  (with smoked gouda) makes me want to throw confetti, it's so great. Same thing for each of the entrees: everything tastes fresh, the spices are perfectly balanced, and there is just an obvious love of food and flavor to everything. Food this good is an act of generosity.   I've always had very good service, albeit a teensy slow at times; I think they could use one more server during the busiest hours. Regardless, servers are always well-informed, thoughtful, and in good humor.   I lived in Tucson for 6 years, so I know Mexican food. This is almost as good as Mexican fusion gets."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and it was delicious. Great staff...checked in on us the whole time but weren't annoying. Got the margarita sampler they were all great, had a good selection and a variety of flavors. Had a huge selection of tequila as well. Salsa's and guac were very good. Got the taquitas for dinner which are basically fajitas, I was happy with my decision since they were also delicious. I would definitely recommend trying this place and I am excited to go back again."}
{"text":"This was good.  I will definitely return to Momocho.  It was delicious and a really neat place, just not what I expected after all the hype.  I feel like I need to eat there again.  Everyone in our friend circle was raving about Momocho, so we went on a Wednesday evening.  When we got there, we waited about fifty minutes for a table.  It was chilly out and we had to wait outside because the inside was just packed.  Waiting wasn't a huge deal, everyone was kind. Across the street there was a kid dancing on the roof of his mom's van.  We just watched him while we waited for our seats.  I'm sure that this kind of entertainment does not happen every day, but the stars were aligned for us.  We were seated on the patio. This was not ideal because it was getting colder, but we didn't mind.  Ordered drinks and food and our server came out to tell us that a table had opened up indoors and that she would love to move us in there if we wanted.  I really appreciated this.  It definitely made extra work for her to move us and our drinks all upstairs but I appreciated being out of the cold so much.   The walls upstairs were decorated with paintings of luchadores.  I LOVED them.  I could NOT stop looking at them.  I went home and made a painting of my sister and her husband as luchadores and gave it to them as a wedding gift.  It is hanging in their living room.  My husband ordered the duck confit tacos and I got the goat cheese guacamole.  I am extremely leery of people putting things into guacamole.  I like it very simple.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The goat cheese and poblano guac was very good. The chips were perfect. My husband's tacos were also very good, just not as good as I was expecting after all of the talk.  They were also very small for the price.  They just weren't mind blowing enough to be that small.  I will be back.  The service here was just wonderful. The restaurant is well decorated and cool.  They definitely make the most of the space that they have.   The food was great.  I will definitely be back to try some more adventurous guacamole."}
{"text":"Since Momocho's was featured on the food network, I was very excited to go there. However I had problems with both the service/attitude of the restaurant and the food.   ***SERVICE/ATTITUDE = THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS WRONG!:  When I arrived wasn't sure how many people were coming so I requested a table for 10 (3 of us arrived early). Their first response was, \"we cannot accommodate you.\" Afterward, I asked about sitting out on the patio, which was vacant. They said it was ok but would not allow us to put 2 tables together. This was because they did not want to collapse an umbrella at one of the tables. We would just have to break up into 2 groups. Then we sat down and took a look at the menu. When the waiter came back we asked about the happy hour specials. His response was that we are not allowed to partake in the happy hour specials if we are out on the patio, which I thought was ridiculous! After calling the organizer of our little get together, I found out that our party of 10 was only going to be a party of 6. So we moved inside and all sat at the bar. After everyone arrived and we ate our meal, we decided that we wanted to move back outside. Happy hour was over and we still wanted to hang out and have a few drinks. When we got the bill they added a 20% gratuity (parties of 5 or more), which I didn't think they deserved, but moreover, they added that even though we sat at the bar. I thought that was inappropriate. Then they REFUSED to split up the check! Again ridiculous! At this point I wanted to leave, but the others still wanted to have a drink on the patio. Now there was only 5 of us. So we went to the patio and only 3 of us ordered drinks. However, when the bill came there was the 20% gratuity again! Summary: They were very unaccommodating and I felt that they did not care about the customer.   ***DRINKS = SUGARY:  Firstly, the Margaritas were pure sugar. I did not care for them. Plus, for being so expensive I would have expected them to make each drink individually, but instead it was all premixed. I understand that they do this to save time, so I really am not going to doc them for that. I was just surprised.   ***FOOD = NOT WORTH IT!:  5 of the 6 of us ordered food. The waiter seemed to think that the wild boar and the duck were the best items on the menu, so in addition to those 2, we also got the tuna and mahi mahi. No one thought their meal was particularly amazing. Actually, the menu made the dishes sound more flavorful than they were. The tuna was good, but if the sweet jelly-like salsa would not have been included, it would have been very forgettable. The duck was good, however duck is very fatty, so when they cooked it all the fat melted into the bottom of the dish and they did not drain it. So a good portion of it was soaking in a pool of grease. In addition, I don't know what authentic tortillas are supposed to taste like, but these had a very strong woody taste that I did not care for. Summary: Not worth the price and would not go back.   ***DECOR = I ACTUALLY LIKED IT!:  Ok, so this place's one saving grace was the décor. The interior has a very unique feel with a lucha libre X day of the dead theme. I really liked it. The bar was beautiful with a backlit wine rack and irregularly shaped hide light fixtures. One of the main art pieces involved several crosses carved into wood and some cut out and back lit. It was very interesting and visually appealing.  ***FYI: I am posting this on Yelp because my comment on Google and a couple other negative comments were mysteriously hidden on the Momocho's Google page. . . Very fishy."}
{"text":"Overrated kid of a strange menu for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I am always amazed at the magic Eric Williams weaves into dinner at Momocho. He is a master of flavors! I could stop just for the Mexican coffee and jalapeño ginger bread pudding-  I travel from the east side for dinner at Momocho- the spicy mango margarita and guacamole are perfect starters.  Great place and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE.  Had dinner here with my husband and brothers-in-law, and we had a grand old time.   The restaurant is so cute, great atmosphere for a date.  Dimmed lighting and the art on the wall is a good conversation starter!  We had margaritas and guacamole to start.  The cucumber margarita is spectacular.  Not too strong, and very refreshing. We tried the smoked trout/bacon and the blue cheese/garlic guacamoles.  Both were outstanding. And the homemade chips were hot and crispy.  For our entrees, we all got taquitos: wild boar, adobo braised pork, hanger steak and pork belly.  YUM.  Homemade tortillas were SO delicious.  For dessert, we had the horchata pudding. No words. Just get it.   I would move to Cleveland for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was traveling with my sister and friends and we stopped in this place because of the great yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. Kevin was our server and was awesome as was all the other staff. Food was delicious. We asked for our waiters recommendations and got those."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy guacamole in my tummy. They have so many guacs to choose from. I tasted the goat cheese and traditional guac and they were fabulous. The beet, spinach, cheese dish served with tortillas was very different and satisfying. I will absolutely return soon."}
{"text":"We had a lovely late dinner here after checking in to a nearby B&B following a long drive from Chicago.   We sat outside on the quiet patio and were immediately welcomed by a gracious, but not overbearing server. we started with a guacamole with jicama, pineapple, mint & habenero peppers! Fresh, sweet with a wonderful kick. My husband had the machaca taquitos, a delicious coffee braised beef, and I had the shrimp taquitos with a sharp pineapple jicama salsa. The portions were perfect as was the service.  If you are ever in the Ohio City neighborhood in Cleveland and in the mood for Mod Mexican, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Was super excited about the empanadas I ordered and they were just okay. However, my margarita was great (and strong!), the guacamole was fresh and incredibly amazing and the side of dumplings I ordered were so good I could have just eaten a few orders of them for my meal! We will definitley be going back."}
{"text":"Momocho is one of the best, if not the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. It is \"Modern Mexican\" so it's a lot different than the Mexican food most people know. There are no Quesadillas and burritos covered in mole sauce. They still have about 6 different types of guacamole ranging from traditional to smoked trout  guacamole which are all very good although they often need a little salt. They have salsas as well but they are flavorless and not worth getting. They make their chips fresh to order and are some of the best I've ever had. Momocho is known for their taquitos which consist of a meat, peppers and onions, two sauces, and small flour tortillas. They are phenomenal. I have been here several times and I can say with 100% certainty that the duck taquitos are the best. The wild boar taquitos are good as well. The shrimp taquitos aren't enough food and are not worth the money. I generally don't order dessert when I go out to eat but they're fried ice cream is amazing. Ordering this is a must. I'm not a big margarita and sangria guy but my girlfriend says they're great. I recommend Momocho to everyone that comes to Cleveland and I would say that it's one of the better restaurants around."}
{"text":"Margarita's are delicious and refreshing. Place gets packed after 5:30 pm but doesn't get loud. Tortilla chips and guac with jicama was great. The steak/bifteck tauquitos not so much; steak was chewy and not appetizing, skip."}
{"text":"Overall our trip to Momocho was a pleasant experience.  The place itself is fairly small and a bit cramped.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have trouble walking or are handicapped.   Although there is a small lot next door, parking can be a bit tight.  The service was friendly and knowledgeable.   We ordered the guac sampler which I would highly recommend, since it's almost impossible to pick one.  However at $18 it was overpriced.  We tried the traditional, goat cheese, and blue crap.  The goat cheese and crab were fantastic.  While of great quality, the traditional was nothing exciting.  It is on the chunky side.  My wife also tried a blood orange margarita which was one of the best she has ever had.    For main courses we had the plato (duck), chancho (wild boar), and atun (tuna) tacquitos.  The duck was excellent, especially when accompanied by their bbq sauce.  The wild boar was fairly decent as well.  It was not very game-y and was perfectly cooked.  The tuna was also cooked to perfection and comes highly recommended.  Overall a very solid 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"ALL TIME FAVE!  This place is great for any occasion. The best margaritas and guacamole, hands down. We've tried almost everything on the menu and everything has always been SO DELICIOUS. Hooray for Momocho!"}
{"text":"Tho place was awesome. Great service, Great margaritas, great apps, great dinner, great desert."}
{"text":"Go hungry, leave happy! Intriguing decor. Best margaritas I've ever had.  The guacamole sampler is worth it; it comes with 3 full-size portions of guac and 2 baskets of chips. For kicks, I tried the remolacha taquitos with beets and kale.  This dish definitely changed my opinion of beets, which were delicious.  On top of everything, the staff were very friendly, hard working, and obviously trained very well.  Thank you for an excellent experience."}
{"text":"You can always count on amazing, consistent food/drink here!!! Never disappoints... worth the drive . The duck and pork belly were spot on tonight, as well as our favorite trout guacamole.... beyond amazing... if u haven't been here, what are u waiting for?"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Cleveland, hands down.  Recommend trying the Crab or Goat Cheese Guac.  Don't eat too much of it or you'll never make it to dinner.  Check out the wild boar, coffee braised beef or scallop entrees.  Oh and make sure you wash it all down with a (or 3) custom margarita."}
{"text":"Delicious. FOund out about it from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It is none of those, but it was fantastic! On the trip through Cleveland we decided to stop here. Unfortunately, it didn't open until 5pm, so we waited four hours for dinner. It was well worth the wait. We sat outside on the large patio, it was a beautiful day in Cleveland (yes, it happens). The service was very good and helpful with what to order and how large the portions are. The machaca, coffee and ancho braised beef was amazing!!! Also, enjoyed the goat cheese guac and chips. The camerones (shrimp in a garlic wine sauce) was delicious. Dessert was fried ice cream. It was fantastic. More than enough for two people and very satisfying. The machaca and fired ice cream are must orders when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and yes! The guac is delicious, as well as the margaritas! Haven't been in a while, but from what I remember, it's definitely a place I'd like to go back to."}
{"text":"The bomb digity. Great food fun service. Enjoyed the roasted corn and crab guacamole. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their guac and entrees are delicious.  I like how they change the menu on a frequent...but not too frequent basis!"}
{"text":"I did not have a lot but i am certain to return given what i had.  the place is not inexpensive. priced similar to comparable chicago establlishments.   they have different types of guac. i had the ones with goat cheese + poblano, pineapple + habanero. mind you, the guacs are expensive - $9. but they are worth every penny. the reason i say is that, it felt someone made it with a lot of heart. the flavor was well rounded, a bit tart for usual guac, but so much better than the usual.  then i had the mahi mahi with the chimichurri. the fish was perfectly grilled - with chimichurri spooned ver. now this is not your usual chimichurri - it has all the flavors, but the oil is the basis. it comes with an awesome tomatillo salsa - quite a kick and the pineapple+habanero salsa.   hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I chose it for a family special occasion. We got our food after nearly an hour wait, and one main dish came out nearly 30 minutes after the rest; nobody apologized or even took note of the strangeness of this, and we had to ask for the manager.   The venue was small, packed, loud, and too dark.   The food was alright, but not special by a long shot. I had hoped for better.   The only saving grace was our server, who was very helpful and professional. The manager also held herself well when she came over.   Definitely won't return though."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming here b/c Jack Craps is terrible and I igured same owner would provide a similar experience. I was pleasantly surprised by the tastes, but the rules for gratuity (20% automatic for a party of 5...bogus)...and no split checks...pretty lame. Our group of six needed to pay separately, and I ended up calculating each person's amount...the customer should not have to spend a bunch of time doing what 99.99% of restaurants already do for their customers. High prices for what you get. $16.50 for 5 pieces of shrimp with some tiny tortillas is a little ridiculous...and charging for extra chips for some of the most expensive guacamole is a bit frustrating. Fairly pretentious, not as much as Jack Craps, but still a one and done restaurant for me. I wasn't expecting your run of the mill Mexican restaurant prices, but give me a break. It wasn't THAT much better to warrant that type of price increase.  Just thought of this...our group's food came out at different and rather lengthy spans of time from one to the next...made it awkward for eating as a group!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit into Cleveland, I landed in Ohio City, yet another west-side neighborhood with restaurants to rival my Nabokovian standby. We chose Momocho, a hip Mexican joint with dangerously delicious margaritas and handmade guacamole.  I'm pretty sure Momocho means \"Capable of eating 2 entire bags of chips and three bowls of guac\" in Spanish, or at least that was my excuse for doing so. Exceptional flavors, like cucumber margaritas and goat cheese guac, not to mention fried grasshoppers, make it easy to forget that Lake Erie is in your backyard. Though I still think Lolita's entrees outmatch those at Momocho, I've been craving their crazy combinations ever since I returned.  Simply driving in and back from Ohio City reveals the full flavor of Cleveland as well. Though the street where Momocho rests is busy with diners and other rather bourgeois restaurants, blocks away sit abandoned houses, grocery stores locked up like Fort Knox, and rather unsavory signs for \"Peep Shows.\" Riding these streets is a bit like going back about 3 decades, since none of the buildings have changed and the characters that walk past look like the stepped out of Times Square in 1973. I swear saw a child prostitute a la Jodie Foster in \"Taxi Driver\" wearing white bellbottoms and smoking a cigarette. The ride is more bizarre than alarming, as old fashioned saloons and barbershops whiz by, a living metaphor for the city's struggle to develop since its decline in the 1970's and '80s. Yet, with an impeccable pineapple margarita and some blue cheese guacamole resting in my stomach, I recognized that parts of the town had revived enough to support importing grasshoppers."}
{"text":"Food was amazing priced well and large portions. I will be visiting anytime I'm in that part of town. The outside seating was very spacious. And bonus they have a small parking lot with handicap access."}
{"text":"I ordered the wild boar taquitos, but got chicken. I would have sent it back but it took so long to find the waiter that I just gave up and ate it. My dish was so spicy I could barely eat it - and i like spicey food. My friend got the carnitas and couldn't eat it either cause it was too spicy. The third person in our group didn't get her food until I had almost finished my item - she sat there for at least 15 minutes without her food. The waiter said there was a mistake and appologized, but we weren't compensated on our bill.  The outside patio was a very nice space and the drinks and guac were good. But I can't recall ever getting something too spicy to eat and have never seen one person wait so long for theirfood after it was brought out for the others - completely unacceptable.  A fine place for drinks and I hear it is very popular, but I certainly had a much less than ideal experience"}
{"text":"We love coming to Momocho!!! Fun margarita flavors, killer guac, and I'm obsessed with the machaca!!! It's making my mouth water just thinking of it!!! I definitely recommend it!! The blood orange margarita is my fav and I prefer the  plain ol guac :)) service is good but our server was a lil over zealous and cut my mother in law off a few times while she was asking about the food- take a chill pill dude."}
{"text":"We couldn't make reservations but we went anyway. They said 45 mins, but we waited no more than 15.   The beers where modestly priced at ~4.5 and the margaritas were a more at 8 dollars. The margaritas were inventive and very good. My friend had the mango, pineapple, and guava. The guava was my favorite since I chose to try hers.   I had the pato taquito as my entree. It was Duck Confit, chili relleno and pomegranate shredded Barbacoa (pork)! The ingredients were amazing and the interesting flavors blended well! However, the soft shell was rather bland or had an odd taste that I wasn't a fan of. I set aside the soft shell and just ate the mix and I was very happy!   The atmosphere is dark and could be a romantic spot if you choose. We were at a high table near the bar, I've heard the upstairs is really cool but I didn't check it out. I liked the crowed, kinda a hip young crowd littered with trendy older business Types. If you want dress up and look snazzy, you will not feel out of place.  The service was great, our server was very attentive but not too attentive if you know what I mean. We were not rushed and we enjoyed our dinner.   It's pricey if you get Margs and apps. I didn't feel like blowing through my wallet so I just ordered the Taquitos and a Pacifico Beer. It totaled to 25 dollars.   I would definitely go again, maybe try the guacamole everybody raves about. Good experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great place that would be great in any big city. The first floor is hip, trendy, noisy, quirky, and dark. It could easily be a corner bar in New Orleans's Bywater or Irish Channel. Upstairs is more low-key and a bit less evocative but also quieter. The food is great--modern Mexican. A highlight is the imaginative selection of guacamoles. The various taquitos are fantastic, especially the machaca (coffee-braised beef). Don't expect to be seated without reservations on the weekend, and it's a good idea to plan ahead most nights. Great service. Wonderful patio. Afterward, take a walk on the narrow streets of historic Ohio City. You'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This may be the best Mexican restaurant in Ohio.  Warning: It is definitely not your typical Tex-Mex cuisine -- It is much, much better!  Because of this, it is very popular, so you may need to make reservations ahead of time.  My wife and I have eaten here twice without reservations, and the only space available was at the bar.  That's OK with us, as it was just the two of us.  Plus, the bartender was willing to give us a quick course on tequilas and some of the delicious cocktails that can be made with it.  Most recently, along with our margaritas, we enjoyed shared orders of goat cheese guacamole with tortilla chips, shrimp taquitos, and smoked gouda tamales.  All of it delicious!  Their parking lot is small, and was full, but we were able to find a space on the street a half-block away."}
{"text":"Unprofessional. Lazy service. I had a reservation and they act like they couldn't pull up a extra chair or table to accommodate my party."}
{"text":"I must have came on an off day because I would rate this place 3.5 stars. We didn't make reservations but luckily got seated after waiting 20 minutes. Our server was really enthusiastic and graciously explained the menu to us.  We started with the guac sampler and choose the goat cheese, smoked trout, and crab flavours and our server offered to bring us some salsa too. They came out really quick and were tasty but good thing we had the salsa because after a while, all three of them started to taste the same and the salsa helped cleanse the palate a little. Then we waited for our entrees..... and waited.... and waited.... it pretty much took 35 minutes for the entrees to come out and by the time they did we were sooo stuffed with guac and I was got really sleepy because I was full haha.  The duck and brisket taquitos were OK, they weren't amazing but they weren't bad. I reallyed liked the pepita and pecan crusted trout but it was pretty salty. The green beans were also good but salty.  So pretty much I can see why people like the restaurant since it has a cool menu and vibe but I wish the service was a little better and that the food wasn't as salty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were passing through Cleveland and decided to detour to Momocho; as we recently saw it featured on a food network show. For a Tuesday night, this place was packed, which I took to be promising. There was a 20 min wait and the hostess advise us to order a drink and an appetizer from the bar and sit in their back patio while we waited for our table. Which is what we did. We order guacamole with pineapple and Chile. The guacamole was good, however you could not taste the pineapple or chile. That being said I will say our entrees were delicious! I had Machaca and my boyfriend has Chile Rellenos. Our biggest issue was the service. Our waiter was un-attentive through out the evening. He left our table abruptly when we ordering and never came back to clear our appetizer plates or menus. I understand it was a busy night however our waiter was observed socializing with other table and by the time our food was served half the dining room had emptied. Overall though we were pleased with our meal!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a really nice meal here on a Friday night. Our table of four split a pitcher of margaritas and a guacamole sampler. The service was friendly and attentive, and each of us was happy with our entrees. At our table, we had the wild boar taquitos, the carnitas taquitos, the sea scallops entree and the pepita-crusted trout. All were very well done. We had an assortment of desserts as well, and the only one that was a standout was the capirotada. All in all, a very good experience and we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Despite what Guy Fieri might have you believe this is neither diner, drive-in, nor dive. It is however, one of the best places to eat in Cleveland.   For anyone that fancies a good mashed avocado, the guacamole sampler is a must, but good luck trying to decide which 3 to choose! A similar problem emerges with their margarita sampler with choices like Blood Orange and Spicy Mango on the menu.   Be aware that the guacamole \"sampler\" is more than enough food for two people, so be prepared if you order an entree as well. Entrees are filling and delicious as well; you can't really go wrong no matter what you choose!   The staff is really unbelievable as well. Out server was incredibly genial: when it turned out they were out of steak for the taquitos we ordered, he was apologetic and even ended up giving is extra food when we changed our order! When we left, taking our extra guac with us, he also gave us a big bag of chips to go.  You cannot go wrong with Momocho!"}
{"text":"Overrated, overpriced, completely underwhelming!  With all the hype this place gets, along with the line forming out front at 5:00 on a Friday night, we were hoping for so much more. Boy, were we disappointed!  When a so-called Mexican restaurant cannot master the simplest things like beans, tortilla chips, and guacamole, one has to be suspicious of how the entrees will turn out. These failures should have been our cue to leave, but it was an absolutely gorgeous Summer evening and we were without the kids.  The menu is weird. One example: there is but one \"salad,\" and it does not contain anything green or leafy. Strike one. Tortilla chips obviously from a bag: strike two. The overhyped but very mediocre guacamole was strike three. Out.  Next batter at the plate. Upcharging for a small cup of bland salsa with the aforementioned $9 guacamole. A swing and a miss--strike one. The completely tasteless and textureless corn tortillas that come with the taquitos were strike two. Flavorless and uninspiring beans served with the entree--another whiff. Two Ks for the visiting team.  Third batter steps up. Two lackluster entrees for a big swing and a miss. Nothing with chocolate on the dessert menu--strike two. Total bill: $130.00. He retires the side!  I really like to support local businesses that are at the forefront of Cleveland's rebirth, but sadly, Momocho is one and done for me."}
{"text":"Just got back into town after 15 years, and this is an area I wouldn't have been in after dark back in the day.  What a difference 15 years makes!  Momocho is built into an old a 2-story house with a few outdoor seating areas.  There's great art and ambiance as well as a surprising amount of tables.   We had a reservation but outside is first come/first served unfortunately.  They quoted a 30-40 minute wait time for the patios, so we chose to be seated right away upstairs.  Server (and the couple we were with) recommended the Guacamole Sampler (of 3 different types).  We ended up with the Goat Cheese, Trout, and Crab.  I honestly didn't know how I would feel about flavored guacs, but all three were really good, and 4 of us couldn't finish all of them.  The chips are made to order so an extra basket took a bit of time, but they were hot out of the fryer when they came.  3 of us had tacos which are served like fajitas with small tortillas and you make your own.  Two ladies ordered the spiced chicken, and I had the Mahi Mahi.  Our fourth ordered the Scallops well done.  Nice size portions of everything.  Everything was cooked perfectly (even the well done scallops) and tasted great.  We also ordered a pitcher of Cucumber Margaritas (which again I was leery of adding anything to a good margarita),  but these were excellent, refreshing, and with a spicy chili salt rim extremely unique.  I'm going to try these at home...  The only reason it's not a 5-star review was the service.  The server (who's name escapes me and I was lucky enough not to pay so I can't check the receipt) was extremely friendly throughout the evening.  He was apologetic for the delayed greet telling us there were a few Server call-offs that night.  The food then came to the table at 3 different times for the 4 entrees.  Server said the kitchen put up the food for the whole restaurant at once, and was apologetic for that as well.  The quality and taste of the food, the vibe, and the cucumber Margaritas are enough to ensure that we'll be back though, and just hope that the service issues were just a one-off incident."}
{"text":"Thank heavens for the tequila. The food was a complete disaster. Chicken was completely and utterly burnt. The remainder of the food was very salty."}
{"text":"Everything here is completely wonderful.  Only bummer is the price, and the length of happy hour!"}
{"text":"On the pricier side with small portions - but the food and drinks are handcrafted to detail. If you think Chipotle is \"mexican\" food, you may not like it here. All the margaritas are phenomenal, the tacos are delicately created and served, artistically I should say.  This place would fit into Manhattan's Lower East Side - famed for their famous dining experiences - perfectly."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW! We've been trying to come here for months. Finally got a reservation! Got the guacamole sampler (goat cheese was our favorite). Got the margarita flight (habiscus was our favorite). Had the sea scallops for my entree and it was absolutely incredible. Best scallops I've ever had. The creamed corn that it came with was super delicious. Tried the fried ice cream for dessert and it was only okay. Apparently, the jalapeño bread pudding is the dessert to get. Overall, best restaurant in CLE that we've been to."}
{"text":"Everything was delish! You could go get the guac sampler and drinks and fill up with no problem. Very cool atmosphere, great service, and loved the Cucumber Marg. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amaizing... This place had it all; great food, fun attomsphere and good prices.   My wife and I went during a weekend visit to Cleveland. We saw it was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives and decided to check it out. We tried the goat cheses guacamole and the carnitas...All I can say is \"WOW\". We also sampled the cuccumber margarita, while I found it quite tasty, I don't think I could drink more than one. The regular margarita was very good too.  The only bad thing I can say here is that Momocho is 7 hrs from home :-(. I think I would go back to Cleveland just to go to Momocho for dinner again."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best Mexican I've had in a while. Go for happy hour and don't let the word \"taquito\" make you order more than one - the servings are huge.   The guacamole sampler is worth it - but is literally enough chips and guac for 4.   The Portabello mushroom taquitos are amazing."}
{"text":"I've had mostly so-so experiences here. The guacamole is always good but my entree's have always been hit and miss. I think it is incredibly tacky that the margaritas come out of old milk jugs but they do taste good. I love the artwork on the walls it's fun and hip.    Overall I like it more for happy hour or just going with the girls for drinks and app's but I'll head somewhere else for dinner"}
{"text":"The best and pretty much only Modern Mexican restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and even worse service. We we're told it would be a one hour wait. We same back in an hour and then they told us it would be another hour. They are terrible."}
{"text":"First being there with my roommate, we were craving some tacos and we heard a friends say that this was the place to go, and boy were they right! Our server was awesome and friendly I loved the atmosphere and the decor. The margaritas are fantastic ! We got a pitcher and we almost got another ! The food was delicious as well. I think this place has barrio running for its money. This is my new food spot for sure !"}
{"text":"So tasty! I love their guac and their margaritas. I have been a few times and the staff is attentive and friendly. A server who was working on another table even checked to make sure we were ok.  I also have"}
{"text":"You will need reservations to get in here (we got the last one for a Saturday night a week out). They have two floors and a patio of seating, bars both up and downstairs, and just oozes ambiance. The host man with the glasses was so nice and we had amazing service throughout our dining experience (the perfect waiter seriously). I will mention that you should plan to be there for about 2 hours when you eat.  They offer a modern twist on Mexican cuisine, smaller menu but it all sounded amazing. I HIGHLY recommend the fried pig tails (dear god so good!), and had I not been pregnant I would have gotten the margarita sampler and been more adventurous with the guacamole (they have an array of guac). Both the husband and I ordered taquitos and were not disappointed. Portions are a pretty good size, lots of food for your $$.  Last note, the coffee was great. Brewed with cinnamon and brown sugar and so smooth. I would recommend a to-go order to take with you."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible and hostesses are rude on more than one occasion. Table was reserved on Wed for Sat at 8.30 and wasn't ready at 9. Adding one chair to a table for 5 caused an unexplicable commotion. Very unpleasant experience especially that we are regulars and keep coming back for the good food and drinks but service has been unfortunately unpleasant and hostesses rude each and every single time. It's just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent Mod Mex! Pretty long wait to get in, but worth every second. The margaritas are very well made and delicious! We frequented the sister restaurant, 'El Carnicero', in Lakewood because it was a shorter drive and were equally impressed."}
{"text":"Bottom line first, then the details....  The bottom line: Is it good? Yes. Would i come here again? No.    Details:  Food: The food tastes great and is presented very nicely as well. The portions are not large.   Atmosphere: Cool and hip small restaurant. Limited seating but doesn't feel too cramped.   Service: Fine.   Price: too high. This is why I won't be coming back. The cheapest entree is 14 bucks.   Of course this isn't a ridiculous price or anything, but for what you get (a small plate of mexican food), I feel that it's too high.   Don't get me wrong, I had a good experience and the food tasted great, but there are so many options of good eats on the west side....because of the price, I just won't be returning.   3 stars = \"A OK\", and Momocho sits in my memory with that exact phrase."}
{"text":"Having a James Beard nominated chef and being featured on Food Network, I had high expectations for this place. Firstly, our party all ordered Margaritas. Everyone ordered a different flavor, I obviously ordered a Traditional- how else are you going to judge a Mexican place's bar without a traditional margarita.   I am a Food Scientist by trade, and work for an ingredients company that just conducted a 2-week long Sensory Study/Focus group on what makes a good margarita.. I think I would have a general idea. The server and bar-tender would seem to disagree.   The margarita was TERRIBLE!! It was so sweet and sour, it was virtually undrinkable- tasted like straight sour mix. There was no taste of booze to be found. When I called over the waitress to ask for a beer in place of the margarita [that I was not drinking/enjoying], she said that I would have to be charged for both anyway, and that it would not be taken off the bill. (For the record, I never complain about food/drink in restaurants... it's just not done). To quote her, \"we have a policy in  place that we stand by our products and don't offer refunds.\" All I wanted was a beer to replace the horrible margarita.. I accepted the crazy \"customer is apparently wrong\" policy and asked to speak to the manager after the meal. (Again, I never do this).  He was just as pompous as the waitress, declaring that he made all the margaritas tonight and during happy hour and had no complaints. \"It must be my pallet,\" he says. When I told him that it tasted like straight Sour Mix, he said that he used the \"same amount of Sour Mix in all of the drinks that night...\" I was shocked that he admitted to using sour mix.  PS- real margaritas typically aren't made with sour mix...  I was very kind with my complaints, and I felt very insulted by both employees. The members of my party also felt similarly.   Aside from that, the food was ok. Guacamole is worth the trip, just steer clear of the bar after happy hour; apparently that's when they make the \"good drinks.\""}
{"text":"I used to love this place until today - I called and made a reservation for 3 one week in advance only to be told when I got there that my name is not on the list   When I said that I was told this was a confirmed reservation, the rude hostess said that since I didn't get a call it meant it was a no go  I think this place has started thinking way highly about themselves with really poor form of dealing with their customers   RUDE"}
{"text":"We went to Momocho's for a birthday celebration and I am so thrilled that I made a good choice on choosing this restaurant. Everything from our drinks, appetizer, entrees, and service was exceptional. I cannot even call it Mexican because it far surpasses the usual Mexican we are all accustom to. Their gucamole is packed with unique flavors. Their margaritas are fantastic everyone must try the spicy mango. The spicy hits your taste buds first then comes the sweet mango margarita. Their braised short ribs tamales are done as a tamale should be done in a real corn husk! Finally I have discovered a Mexican restaurant who knows how to do a tamale. The flavors were so unique and were all paired well together. Our server was a pleasure to be served by. He knew everything on the menu gave his opinion and was so kind! I would request him if I see him there next time. We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience at Momocho - from our pre-dinner Craft Margaritas through the end of our meal - everything was delicious! Great selection of tequilas; loved each guacamole choice on our \"sampler\"; and the meal combinations are very unique and impressive to say the least! Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"TRULY AWFUL EXPERIENCE! This place isn't fancy enough to be so snobby. My husband and I went here for his birthday tonight, and we were immediately ushered upstairs. This would have been fine, but once seated they told us they don't do happy hour upstairs. Weird rule, but okay. After the waiter brought our chips and drink... he... never... came.... BACK. He literally served every table around us, and left us sitting in a corner awkwardly and hungrily. Finally, I just got up from the table and asked another server to cash us out. It was the weirdest and rudest experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Never going back."}
{"text":"this is in my top 3 favorite restaurants in cleveland.   there is a large variety of high quality margaritas (hibiscus, pomegranate, to name a few) and guacamole (pineapple, crab, goat cheese...) the entrees are high quality and unique too.  you arent getting just tacos or empanadas or enchaladas.  actually you dont see much of that at all.  My favorite entree is the braised boar with a pickled jalepeno/cilantro based dipping sauce as well as a creamy mustard sauce.  the meat and sauces are very fresh and flavorful.  The boar is served with soft taco shells to roll up the meat and sauces in.  decent pricepoint as well.  Great place for happy hour, to start out the night on a weekend, for dinner and a couple drinks during the week, or for a date.  Will continue to go regularly."}
{"text":"On Friday November 07, 2014 I had the pleasure of visiting Momocho Mod Mex for the first time with my cousin Benny (Jack) Oliver who has frequented Momocho on several occasions and finally I was able to join him and see what all the hype was about....Needless to say it was everything and more....nice spot situated on West 25th on Cleveland's Westside...Excellent Mexican food....I came in and fell in love with the atmosphere.....Our server Nick was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!.....he was more than willing to let me know what his faves were and I was not disappointed....I tried everything....I told him what I liked and that I was also adventurous in trying different foods.....so if you are ever in Cleveland visiting or you live here and looking for a place try Momocho you won't be regret it.......You must try the margarita sampler- I had the hibiscus flower, cucumber-blood orange with no ice.....I like them served neat can really taste the flavors.....make sure to try to chips and salsa.....the chile poblano rellano ( spinach stuffed breaded pepper with cheese).....smoked trout with crab.....and the pork chop was divine with a chocolate glaze and smoked gouda tamale dumplings **deelish*** if you a little more adventurous try the Suavecito Blanco tequila with cinnamon orange slices and Nick added a twist on the next we tried we did Don Julio Anjejo tequila with sangrita ( tomatoe & oj juice & habanero) with the cinnamon orange slices.....I could go on and on so I will stop here and tell you to just stop by MOMOCHO MOD MEX you will not be disappointed!!!  Make sure you get Nick and Lori to serve you they are an excellent team #momochomedmexrocks!"}
{"text":"Momocho is truly a special restaurant. The food was amazing - fresh, high quality, full of flavor, generous portions and well priced. All of the taquitos (beef brisket, pork, tongue, shrimp) were phenomenal with lean meats and flavorful spices/sauces. We loved the guacamole - clearly home made with the freshest ingredients. The chips were also some of the most delicious I've ever tasted. We also ordered a plethora of drinks, most notably the margaritas were incredible!! I would highly recommend the spicy mango, cucumber, guava and pomegranate. The service was a little on the slow side but the delicious food and drink easily made up for it. We will definitely return on future visits to Cleveland."}
{"text":"A great cozy hip restaurant located in Ohio City. When you walk in you will be escorted to your table by the owner. This would be a great place to bring a couple of friends and spend a couple of hours socializing over food. The guacamole is great! We were not that impressed with the portabella or mahi mahi, but the atmosphere made up for everything. It looked like they could get busy, so make reservations."}
{"text":"I've been a server so I can understand a night when the kitchen gets backed up and you need your manager to go out and smooth things over with the customers.  The manager offers a free round of drinks or dessert.  Momocho doesn't have a manager like that.  After an hour plus wait for the table and an hour wait for your entree he comes out with an insincere apology and no offer of anything.  Not a single chip!  I've never been to Momocho before and won't be going back.  If you are from the east side head to Lopez.  At least Lopez gives you some chips to eat during the wait.  The food was OK but not worth a second trip even if there is no wait."}
{"text":"Good mexican fusion. I had a pork chop on mole--perfect in spicy-ness for my taste though a bit too spicy for my wife. She had the beef tamales and those were excellent. To start we had the guacamole with sheep's milk gouda and agave nectar, very smooth and a bit too sweet. The chocolate mousse is perfect."}
{"text":"We went into this place having high hopes (voted #1 Mexican food in Cleveland multiple times) as we were disappointed. Maybe this should probably be a 3.5 star rating, but since that isn't an option, three it is. I'll start with the cons: the margaritas were a little syrupy - they lacked the clean freshness that you expect from a traditional restaurant. (For comparison, they were sort of like margaritas from Chiles.) The regular guacamole and chips were nothing special. Overall the food was good, but nothing to rave about (didn't live up to hype). There were some pros: the crab guacamole was fantastic (I would actually come back for that and a Pacifico.) and the staff was also very nice with no complaints there. One other things that seemed a but weird was the vibe on the top floor (where we were seated) I don't know if it was a tough crowd, but it didn't seem as \"cool\" of a place as I was expecting. Could have been the wrong place (2nd floor) at the wrong time (9:15pm). Overall, this place was good enough."}
{"text":"Make reservations! This place is small and popular. The margaritas were tasty. The guacamole sampler lets you try 3 of the 7 types for $18. We had the goat cheese red pepper, pineapple japaleno, and the smoked trout. It was all delicious. But it was filling so two couples shared 2 entrees. The Tinga chicken skewers were moist and tasty. The mole and salsa verde are tangy and flavorful but not spicy at all. The pato (duck) was succulent. The green beans are to die for!"}
{"text":"Muy bien!  I recently ate at Momocho while on business to Cleveland.  Excellent food, especially their taquitos and Tecate.  A cool atmosphere and a blast during Happy Hour!  Definitely consider this restaurant one of Cleveland's best."}
{"text":"I never had Mexican like this. I have been here a few times. It is set back in a quiet residential area and has both indoor and outdoor (in good weather) dining. Parking may be a problem when it gets crowded, but I usually end up there in the middle of the week for the second seating, and so have never had a problem with parking.  The service is very good and the wait staff is personable. When asked for recommendations, they ask a few questions about your personal tastes before they answer.  The menu is not extensive, but contains entrees that are not normally seen in most Mexican restaurants. My particular favorite is the pork chop, cooked to order, which comes attired in molé sauce. They also serve several different variants of guacamole, and you can sample all of them with the guacamole appetizer sampler.  They also have a good selection of beers, including local craft beers.  You'd have to be an extremely hard-to-please individual not to like this place."}
{"text":"Strong margaritas, delicious guacamoles, creative interior design, and it's a Pokestop!"}
{"text":"Best food ever!  Traveled from Columbus, Ohio 2 times this year to eat here. Mango margettis are amazing, awesome guacamole and the new item we tried last night was braised short rib tamales...still dreaming about them.  On my next trip there, I will definitely  be getting them."}
{"text":"Best guacamole hands down! I got the sampler- loved it! Love the atmosphere. Great place to get together with friends"}
{"text":"Arrived a little after five pm and we were seated promptly. The tables began to fill up very fast, so you should definitely have a res. Happy hour is wonderful here. $4 gold margaritas plus half off taquitos!! To start off with, we had the salsa trio. I liked two of the three. The verde lacked some flavor, but the pico and pineapple & jicama were spot on. Chips were a bit salty. For the taquitos, I had the machacha, beef braised with ancho and coffee. Delicious! My other half had the wild boar which was pretty good as well. And of course we had to get dessert. The fried ice cream was huge but oh so good! The service was excellent. Tom was our server and spot on about everything!"}
{"text":"Got there early to wait in line and sit at the bar, and were not disappointed! Had the tradicional guac, margarita flight, butternut squash and goat cheese empanadas in absurdly perfect mole sauce, beef short rib tamales and camarones taquitos.  Left happy and stuffed!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, great decor, sugar skulls and tattoos everywhere but no attitudes to be found in the house which was also nice. Service was friendly and snappy. We were seated in 10 minutes on a Sunday evening which amazed me, but paid for it on the back end waiting an exceptionally long time for our food. The guacamole was a little plain for my taste. I had the Machaca dish which was stringy and a little dry but tasted great with some habenero pickled onions and guacamole on it wrapped in the warmed corn tortilla. My friend had the Mahi Mahi which he reported was a bit dry as well. I am hoping that we just came in on a down day. I would like to return one day and eat there again and compare...I had such high hopes, maybe next time."}
{"text":"We read that Mike Symon loved this place so we drove up and have it a try. ... worth every minute of the 3 hr drive.  Service was great,  cucumber and spicy mango margaritas were crazy good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Simple combination of great food, creative drinks and cozy atmosphere. Will be back a lot."}
{"text":"Amazing guacamole and margaritas!  Cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"We have gone a couple times and it's very consistent with the quality and service, both of which are excellent.   The Highlights:  -100% the cucumber margarita! Best margarita I've had hands down, and I'm normally a frozen margarita kinda girl. I was shocked by the price actually being lower than I expected for the quality of the drink.   -The service is excellent. No matter how busy they are, we always have a great experience with their employees. They are super informative and patient with questions. Good job hiring manager!   -atmosphere is fun and young, but anyone  of any age can eat there and have an enjoyable time!   The only thing I would say that takes away a star is that the menu isn't very big. There are very few main course options and I wish there were a few more entrees to choose from.   Overall it's a great, fun, lively place to have a date night or a get together with friends!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour. It is imparent that you get there at 5pm or you will not get a spot at the bar. We got there at 5 and the bar was almost full. They were very accommodating and asked a couple if they could move down a seat to make two chairs open for us, which was nice. We had half off taquitos and margarita for happy hour which were awesome! The cucumber margarita isn't half off but it is a must try!! Also try their guacamole, awesome!!"}
{"text":"Found this place after combing through Yelp on a recent trip to Cleveland for some dinner for myself and a work colleague(thank you Yelpers). It was a Tuesday night around 8:30 and we were seated pretty quickly which was great as I feared we'd wait 30 minutes to eat here and I really didn't want to drive around a strange neighborhood looking for another place to go.  I ordered a strawberry -mint margarita which was good, maybe a bit overly sweet (kinda reminded me of being flavored with Kool-aid and I did not taste any mint), but it hit the spot.  The goat cheese guacamole was good (yeah!  you could actually taste the goat cheese), and my travel companion and I scraped the bowl clean with the accompanying substantial, salty corn chips.  He ordered the pecan crusted trout which he said was amazing and I something described by the waiter as Mexican lasagne with smoked trout and crab layered between tortillas and beans with a crema sauce and crowned with a fried egg.  It was a good, comfort food dish; albeit a bit salty and for some reason, the smoked trout was a little jarring in the mixture.  No problem, I just slathered the delicious guac on top to cover the salty, over smoked trout taste.  I can see how this place would be great to hang out at after work or on a sunny day on the back patio.  Food is solid and drinks are reasonably priced -but nothing was truly a WOW to deserve the fourth yelp star..."}
{"text":"Went last Thursday. Very disappointed. Guac was bland, no flavor at all. Service unattentive, dirty hands chipping at ice to put in drink was odd...I chose not to drink it. Spoiled crab in my tacos, instant stomach churner.   Quality poor, service poor as well. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I gave Momocho another try last night, because my boyfriend thinks it is awesome.  Again, it was just ok.  This time I tried the traditional guacamole.  It was very salty.  I had the blood orange margarita, because I love blood oranges.  I couldn't taste the orange at all.  It just tasted like a standard margarita.  I had the pork chop.  It was good.  Well-cooked, good flavor in the sauce, but nothing to rave about.  Service was good.  We sat at the bar.  Unfortunately, the small bar space means that one loud table means no one can hear anything else.  If you want it a little quieter, I would sit upstairs.  Somehow the kitchen is quieter."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with the guacamole... who would think that blue cheese would work.  The only upsetting thing about the night had nothing to do with the joint.  Food was good (chicken skewers), drinks (pomegranate margarita - yum),  and again the guacamole... They were able to take a last minute reservation for us - also great and we were sat right away. The bad...my husband never gave me a bite of his meal...trout maybe.  We were sitting apart so I couldn't sneak in.  And one person in our group apparently \"hates Cleveland\"... My response \"okay, then you should leave\", Cleveland that is. Another plus is their outside seating in the summer."}
{"text":"Came here after work with friends for happy hour.   Got right in since they had just opened. The traditional margaritas were the only ones that were on special for happy hour. I splurged and got the cucumber margarita. So glad I did!  We shared a traditional guacamole. Worth the drive just for that!   The taquitos were part of the happy hour so I got machaca. So good! Can't wait to come back and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great, just be sure to make a reservation as they get very busy. But its totally worth the wait"}
{"text":"I love it!! All they have is great! Service is good, the atmosphere is nice, they have a lot of kinds of tequila, I love their  cucumber margarita and the Jamaica margarita"}
{"text":"The good: nice presentation, eclectic décor, tasty chips and guac    The bad: Main entrée sucked  - some kind of sloppy beef taco.  I honestly had no desire to take more than a couple bites and I am not super picky and was very hungry.  Had a couple margaritas too - super sweet and nothing special.  Spent $100 on a meal for two and would have had a much tastier and economical meal at Chipotle.    Summary: This is another example of a restaurant trying to be unique and combine way too many ingredients to be a fancy bistro and charge high prices, when they should be working on making simple food fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"It was pretty good here. I liked the guacamole with salmon but I LOVED the spicy margarita. I recommend this place for a night out."}
{"text":"My wife got reservations here for my promotion \"party.\"  It was only the two of us and the place is pretty nice.  Very good service and very nice food (for vegetarians).  I would order anything on the menu (we tried a bunch of stuff)."}
{"text":"Amazing. As stated on another review, the margarita sampler and guacamole sampler are both must-haves for first timers. Cucumber, pineapple, and blood orange margaritas were perfect. All the guacs were great, but the goat cheese is by far the best.  I had the sea scallops as well and the flavor was spicy, yet savory and not heavy at all. Cooked perfectly.   We sat on the back patio. It was just about 5 tables. Relaxed atmosphere. Service was perfect. We had 2 small children in our party and they were more than accommodating.   Definitely a must-visit!"}
{"text":"The only real con I can think of for Momocho is that they're so popular that it can be hard to get a seat without a reservation, especially on a weekend night. That said, that is the easiest con in the world to overcome: I've happily had many delicious meals at the bar (probably a bit easier to do with just one or two other diners in your group), I regularly visit on non-weekend nights and, if I do want to go on a weekend, I just plan ahead and make a reservation.   As for the pros: everything else."}
{"text":"The goat cheese guacamole is SO good. I still dream about it. They're tequila list is also out of this world and the wait staff was knowledgeable about the different varities."}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland briefly, this was a stop made necessary by Guy Fieri as I had seen Momocho on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (though it's really none of these) recently.  This is a trendy, foodie paradise.  Interesting wines, etc.  Cool mix of young families and Cleveland's beautiful people.  (Waiting outside, we were entertained by newly introduced toddler, dog and stick.)  And Mexican comfort to die for.  The smoked gouda tamale dumplings are a must (just the name is poetic).  The guacs are special (and I'm not a big guac fan), e.g., corn, crab, chile chipotle guac (that's just one).  And the taquitos are, well, the meat&potatoes of the experience, certainly if you do the machaca (beef brisket).  With the warm corn tortillas, these were like fajitas or soft tacos but those names do not do them justice.  Machaca sounds better.  The meat was dark and deeply rich in flavor.  The accoutrements were minimal -- some peppers, onions, salsa verde, and a side of guac, nice but made forgettable by my daughter's corn, crab, chili guac (mmm!).  And, for those who spit in the eye of moderation, there's a nice flan, which serves as the ideal cooling, sweetening happy ending."}
{"text":"I love real Mexican food.  I vacation there, I have friends that live there and take me to real restaurants when I visit.  Many people have raved about Momocho but I avoided it because quite frankly the menu looked pretty boring to me.  After they were on TV my wife and I decided we could no longer call ourselves food snobs if we didn't go try it.  My mother was in town so we all went.  We were not impressed with the design of the place but if the food is good we don't care about decor.  Service was slow and inattentive, but again if the food is good I don't care.  Food was pretty blah.  Even the coffee rubbed brisket they are famous for.  Just blah.  Even my mother who doesn't get to eat high end food very often just shrugged at hers.  So in discussing it afterwards we realized something: everyone who raved about it only discussed drinks and quacamole.  Turns out our friends are all lushes and that's all they really love about the place!  This just isn't my place- lots of people love it, it just doesn't do it for me.  Like a lot of places, I feel like the hype elevates people's opinions of food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the second time we ate here the experience was not very good.  We arrived at 5 on a Saturday, we were going to get a quick bite before the ball game.  We were sat immediately, but that is where the trouble started.  We waited an hour and 1/2 and only received drinks and after almost an hour finally received some chips that we ordered.  At the 1 1/2 hour mark the food that was delivered to our table was not ours, the server took another 10 minutes to come over and tell us our food was not coming any time soon.  We left as we needed to get to the game without even eating dinner.  Not sure what happened, but not a very good experience to say the least."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such great reviews. We were passing through and chose it based on the reviews and its DDD appearance with Guy Fieri. We waited an hour and a half to get a table. While we waited we had the margarita sampler which was quite good, a bit above the average magarita, but certainly not the best ever. We also had a guacamole sampler. The traditional was best, but they were all way too salty. (I have POTS and am encouraged to put extra salt on everything, but the guac was too much even for me.) Once we got a table we waited for another hour+ before our wild boar and duck confit taquitos arrived. They were both a big disappointment. The duck was mostly dried out and the boar, again, super salty. The only redeeming aspect of our visit was the wait staff who were friendly and obviously working hard. I would not eat here again. Summary: wait for food unacceptably long (I was standing up to leave when food arrived) and food that was below average. That's a killer combination."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Drinks a lil 2 sweet that it overpowers the liquior ..."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican with a unique menu. The wild boar is cooked very well and has lots of flavor. The guacamole is probably the standout with a bunch of very cool, unique flavors (the goat cheese one is really good).  Service is great..everyone is really friendly.  Pro tip: Don't eat outside if it's going to rain. 3/4 through our meal it started to downpour and the umbrellas did little to protect us or our meals :(."}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Had the Carnitas Tacos and the preparation and presentation was great!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas I've ever had! I recommend getting the sampler with cucumber, spicy mango, and blood orange. The drinks go great with the guacamole sampler. As for the main course, I always get the carnitas and build my own tacos. The taco sauces are amazing. I have never had a bad experience here. Service is great! Best happy hour around (first floor only)."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice.  The staff was nice but very busy.  It took an hour to get seated, which was not so unusual for a Saturday night.  The Mexican food was just way overpriced for the execution.  We just moved here from Dallas/Fort Worth and were missing our regular intake of tacos and whatnot.  This was the place in Cleveland that people kept mentioning, so I was horrible disappointed.  I would have been less disappointed if I'd spent $25 for a dinner for two.  Instead I spent about $65 on a dinner that was significantly less tasty that something that would have cost me $30 in Dallas or Fort Worth.    My wife had the carnitas taquitos and I had the mahi mahi taquitos.  Neither were horrible, but we both agreed that they were pretty tasteless and at $15+ per plate, it was not as good as a $5 taco anywhere in Texas.  The kicker was that we had to pay $5/plate extra for a side of black beans and they tasted like they were straight out of a can.  So, twice as expensive and half as tasty as the average Texas Taco.  The drinks were really good.  I had a Mexican coffee and my wife a margarita.  We enjoyed both.  But, I doubt we'll ever go back for food."}
{"text":"WOW!  Loved the dining experience here.  You must try the Wild Boar!  perfectly tender and oh so flavorful, with the side of sofrito for making yummy tacos, it was an outstanding dish.  My honey's Kobe Beef was also beautifully done, the beef was so tender and spicy in the best of all ways.  The staff was also very accommodating for our littlest herself (Catherine M.) with a great cheesy quesadilla.    The atmosphere is bustling and fun, not too loud or overwhelming.  I absolutely loved the pictures of all the luchadors (sp) on the walls, it reminded me of when I myself was an avid fan of professional wrestling.  When I come back to Cleveland, you can bet that me and My Honey will be coming back to Momocho."}
{"text":"Heard about Momocho last year while watching a Diners, Drive-ins and Dives marathon on the Food Network. I was intrigued and made sure that if I ever went to Cleveland, I would check it out. And - it was SO worth it. I would drive to Cleveland for the crab-corn-chile chipotle guacamole ALONE!   We were told when we made our reservations that it would be a \"two hour dining experience\" and that it was!  The servers never rushed us and their recommendations were excellent! I had the avocado leaf crusted tuna / blood orange-jalapeno marmelada taquitos - though a bit skeptical about the blood orange-jalapeno marmelade, by the end of thet meal I was literally licking the bowl clean. The key to Momocho is that they combine fabulous protiens with these incredible sauces - and if you're eating in a group, nothing should stop you from trying other sauces! :)   Note on portion sizes - the portions are more than adequate and if you combine the entree with some guacamole, you will be stuffed! We were so stuffed that we couldn't even look at the dessert menu - though we vowed to come back!   Overall - A+!"}
{"text":"My friends and I kept hearing amazing things about Momocho, so we decided to check it out. As soon as we walked in, I was diggin the ambiance (dimly lit with artsy Mexican decor) and the crowd (half-hipster, half-business casual).  We started off with the guacamole sampler (traditional + goat-cheese + pineapple) and the margarita sampler (cucumber + guava + pineapple). The guacamole was LEGIT... the goat-cheese guac was my personal favorite. We all loved the guava margarita so much that we ordered a pitcher. I ordered the chorizo & queso fundido... it came with 5 tortillas and was pretty filling. The chorizo was well seasoned, and the queso was melted perfectly. My friends ordered different types of taquitos and were equally satisfied.  Overall, I strongly recommend Momocho... the best Mexican restaurant in Cleveland. I'm definitely coming back for more guacamole and margaritas."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best meal, staff and atmosphere in all of our travels.  It may be small but it packs a lot into it!!  We used to have Emeril's NOLA restaurant as the top of our list, but it has been replaced!!  We started with the guacamole and margarita samplers, then crispy confit pig tails (outstanding), the wife had the pork chop which was better than any pork chop we've had!! I had the braised short rib tamales which were the best tamales ever!!!!  We sat at the chef's table which put our meal time at about 2 1/2 hours but it was so worth it.  Definetly going back, maybe try a regular table this time.  Get reservations, you'll need them!!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go here for quite some time and I wasn't disappointed!  Fortunately they do take reservations, so we were seated immediately.  First, Tom, our waiter was excellent.  He was very informative and attentive and thankfully, talked the four of us out of ordering two guacamole samplers (we didn't finish the one that we had ordered).  The guacamole was wonderful.  Everyone in our group was very pleased with their dinner choices.  I ordered the pecan crusted trout and it was delicious.  The only drawback was the beer selection.  They only serve Mexican beer.  There are so many great offerings from local breweries i was surprised those weren't available.  But, I will be back, if only for the guacamole."}
{"text":"Brian and I have been eating at Momocho for two years and never a bad meal.  We love the environment, the food is excellent, and let's not even talk about the margaritas.  Eric and his staff never disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been to Momocho more times than I can count...each time my experience has been quite awesome. I have been here for dinner, happy hour, appetizers, and just drinks.    I have never made a reservation for this place and have never had an issue getting in, sometimes we've had to eat at the bar, but I really have no problems with that. Even though I have never had issues getting in (I live just a few houses away and usually only go in the middle of the week to avoid the crowds) I would still recommend making a reservation if your heart is set on eating here.  Living close by, I have seen lines to get in before they even open on Friday and Saturday nights.  When you go here, you have to order the guacamole and margaritas, so very good. I think I have had almost all of their guacamole's and tasted all of their margaritas. You really can't go wrong with any of the choices, but my favorites are- Guacamole- goat cheese; gouda; and crab (these are the main ingredients in each one, they do contain other delicious flavors). This comes with a big basket of house made tortilla chips, perfectly cooked and salted. You will not be able to stop eating these. The margaritas - Red bell pepper, spicy mango and the cucumber, each come with a spicy pepper salt rim and a perfectly spicy taste. The guacamole and margaritas are also served as samplers, you can choose three different kinds and taste more than one flavor. (Singles approx. $8; samplers approx $15).  My usual dishes are the carnitas (pork), machaca (beef brisket) and tinga (grilled chicken skewers). These are also my favorites. The machaca can be a little on the salty side, but still delicious. These all come with tiny corn tortillas and two sauces on the side, a green tomatillo and an additional sauce specific for each dish. Carnitas has a honey-chile chipotle sauce that I want to just drink straight from the bowl, machaca has a side of the traditional guacamole and the chicken has their house made pico de gallo. (Approx. $15 per dish)  Definitely try to come here if you haven't already, or visit their other location in Lakewood (El Carnicero), also great food and a little more variety (they have tamales).  Just remember this is not traditional Mexican food, it's Mod-Mex...Equally delicious, just a little different than traditional.  Also this isn't the cheapest of places to eat.  When we come for a full course, margaritas, guacamole and dinner it is definitely for a special occasion. Otherwise we stop by for happy hour, a couple drinks and a guacamole."}
{"text":"A great example of authentic Mexican cooking.  Momocho is a place you go to get a genuine taste of Mexico. I had carnitas that cannot be duplicated by your local Mexican chain. If your favorite Mexican dish is the #17 with chicken, you really owe it to yourself to pop into this little joint.  The upstairs dining area is small and intimate, without being too tightly packed. The walls boast pictures and paraphernalia of Nacho Libres, Mexican wrestlers, and has an almost man cave feel to it.  You'll also have a good eye on he guacamole bar, which is amazing to watch. The menu has over 10 different guac's all tasting as unique and delicious as the rest.   So I highly recommend that you make a reservation and check this place out!"}
{"text":"One word, GUACAMOLE!  Yes, please!  We have been coming to Momocho for many years.  Always delicious.  Always a great service and an excellent place to bring guests looking for a unique experience.  From the wild boar to the guac, I've never been disappointed.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best all around meal I've had in Cleveland yet. 5 lizard was a great be to start things of with. Nachos and pico were served in a large portion, the tacos were going and unbelievably flavorful. The wild boar was or of this world. Finish with the mouse, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Numerous kinds of guacamole is good enough for me."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. A fantastic atmosphere, friendly wait staff and amazing food make this place worth writing home about.   Starting with the guacamole sampler appetizer which brings 3 huge portions of a selection of flavors. We had the goat cheese, pineapple and original and all 3 delivered as promised. I think our favorite was the goat cheese.   Moved on to the beef short rib tamales which were a great portion of flavorful and tender beef paired with 2 tamales that were clearly homemade."}
{"text":"Great food!!  This is not your usual tex mex food...and that's a good thing.  Lots of different guacamoles and margaritas...all delicious.  Fish tacos are to die for.  Young, local crowd but we didn't feel out of place.  Definitely call for reservations, but people who came in without them were accommodated."}
{"text":"things that break my heart:  discovering that the fulton bar and grill is gone. things that warm my heart:  discovering that amazing back patio is still there, finding the menu to have about eight different mixes of homemade guacamole (though it must have been damn good to be $7.50 or $8 a pop...), and partaking in the perfect dessert for summer:  carmelized banana flautas. sitting in a mixture of some rum or something with a kick..and whipped cream. creamy bananay alcoholic goodness.  cleveland needs more places like this place. and it couldn't hurt if they redid the fulton..maybe next door. best of both worlds, my friends. but do partake in their food.  the chefs here deserve a big kudos."}
{"text":"Wow!  Absolutely perfect guac & chips and I loved the chorizo queso and Margarita sampler (spicy mango in particular).  Short rib tacos were very good.  Excellent service.  All around a wonderful restaurant and a true gem."}
{"text":"68 dollars for 2 \"pitchers\" of margaritas. All the drinks are pre-made and come from plastic containers that look like anti-freeze. You have no idea what type of liquor you're getting or how strong the alcohol really is. The service was horrible and we had to ask for our check several times. The food was good but the overall alcohol and atmosphere was poor. Probably would never go back and would definitely never recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"The goat cheese guacamole was really yummy. The spicy mango margarita was also very delicious - they used a really delicious mango juice - thick, not runny.   The bulgogi tacos were flavorful and they piled a lot into the plate. The shrimp taco serving was less generous, though equally as good.   The only complaint I have is that it's a little more pricey than I think it should be; price point should be a little lower, or the serving sizes should be a little larger."}
{"text":"My review is for the happy hour. They have a really limited amount of chairs and they let the clients hold chairs for their friends, so even if there are chairs available, they may be on hold for someone that may never show up. We were awfully greeted by the waitress and I which I remembered the exact day we went but it was Spring 2013. The food is really good but do not recommend this place for Happy Hour. It is like they have the HH but they really just want people to have dinner. I usually try the HH and if I like it I go for dinner. I like people to treat me well if I am paying so I will probably make every effort to not go for dinner here. I may try El Carnicero though. They really know how to mix flavors and give there food a very special touch and I bet the new restaurant is as good. It is just too disappointing to get this type of treatment when you are supporting their business."}
{"text":"WHAT AN AMAZING FIND!  We were in town for a wedding and wanted something more farm to table. We got lucky and found this fantastic modern Mexican place. When we called, they said an hour wait but the bar is first come, first serve. We decided to go up based on reviews and head for the bar.   Bar seating is downstairs and restaurant seating is upstairs. The ambiance is perfect for a date night out.  We got lucky and got a table in the bar area. There's actually lots of seating where guests do not have to sit at the bar but still get restaurant style service. We were happy on the first floor.  We had a fantastic male server. He gave us some great recommendations. We ultimately decided on the salsa sampler and a margarita sampler to start with. We did spicy mango, cucumber, and pomegranate. SO DELISH!  And not what you would expect. For our actual meals, we got the atun and the duck, and shared them both. We were completely stuffed but saw a fried ice cream go by and couldn't resist. SO WORTH IT!    Everything from start to finish was perfect. Whenever we are back in the area we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I made it back to Momocho for the second time, and have to revise my review as they gained a little bit more cred this time. This small but great (modern) Mexican joint in Cleveland lacks somewhat on room, but makes up for in atmosphere and really great food. The menu doesn't appear too big, but when you do it right, it doesn't matter. They have only two sections for entrees, one being all tacos (no matter what you call them on the menu) served in a semi traditional manner, as they have peppers, onions, protein, served with corn tortillas.  The first time I went, the guacamole was the biggest disappointment, and it wasn't bad, just lack the promised (or implied at least) crab in the crab and corn guacamole. This time however we tried the guacamole sampler, and it was great. We actually found a decent bit of the mix ins in our guac, and didn't have to guess which was which, as there was a lot of the flavor of the trout and bacon, and pineapple, etc.  The margarita and tequila selection are as extensive as they are delicious. The house margarita with cucumber is pretty amazing (especially since I don't eat cucumbers), and refreshing. I just stuck to that as it was different, but others tried the blood orange which was great, and traditional, none of which were lacking in alcohol.  We did family style yesterday, and since we got apps, and knew we were getting dessert, were just got 3 dinners for 5 of us this time, as ordering an entree each last time, there were tons of left overs. We tried the duck (again) which is phenomenal, and the brisket covered in coffee, which was very good, but thought the carnitas we had last time was better. Both of those were taco style, and lastly we ordered the pork chop dinner, which got rave reviews from everyone, and I thought was tasty, but just not a chop guy myself really, but the rub and mole that accompanied were great.  If I had to use one word to describe my desert, the Caporitada, it would have to be supermegacrazyawesome.... It really defies one standard word obviously. It is a bread pudding with raisins and cinnamon, and JALAPENOS, but done right, its not too spicy, but had a great savory element to it, and I have ordered it both times, and have been very happy, only thinking it could use some sort of anglaise (or more if there is one on there, as it is all absorbed in by the time it makes its way to the table. I will be back very soon. I did go back, and they earned all 5 stars from all five of us in the party."}
{"text":"First Momocho experience last night.  Tried to make reservations the day before for 6:00pm, thinking it would be no problem for an early weeknight dinner.  Wrong!  The earliest reservation they had available was 8:15pm.  We decied to show up early and take our chances at the first-come tables in the bar or patio.  We got there about 20 minutes after the place opened, and there was already a 90 minute wait for a table.  Wow!  Anyway, the hostesses were very nice and accomodating.  They had the perfect solution for us, which was to order some drinks and snacks from the bar, and hang out at one of the unserved tables in the back until we could get a table in the dining area, which ended up taking only about an hour.    We had a round of 1/2 price margaritas and Tecate to start since it was happy hour.  We also got an order of the pineapple-jicama-mint guacamole.  Everything was so good, we decided to go for another round before dinner.  This time we got 2 margarita samplers (3 flavors of 1/2 size margaritas. Love it!).  We tried the spicy mango, pineapple, guava, hibiscus flower, strawberry-mint, and pa-bango.  I had no idea what pa-bango was, but it tasted a lot like the guava.  It was a different color though, so I don't think they just gave us two of the same.  My favorite was the hibiscus flower, but they were all good.  We also ordred the queso fundido app without the chorizo.  It was tasty, but a little watery.  Would have definitely been better with the chorizo, but then we couldn't  have shared it with our vegetarian dining companion.  For dinner, I had the smoked trout and crab chilaquiles, which would have earned Momocho 5 stars even if everything else had been dreadful.  It was that good.  Definitely in the top 10 meals of my life.  My husband had the pork chop, which he said was just ok (probably because he tasted how awesome mine was and was disappointed he didn't get the same thing).  Our friend had the vegetarian taquitos with beets and spinach, which she said were good, and also a good alternative to the typical vegetarian options she usually sees.  Nothing that we ordered was particularly spicy, so if you're worried about spice these are all good choices.  A trip to Momocho definitely requires patience, or at least pre-planning, as it's very popular and not very big.  It was well worth the wait for us, and both the drinks and the food are deserving of a repeat visit."}
{"text":"As with many of the other reviewers, I too would recommend reservations if you want to go.  The guacamole is some of the best I have ever had, great drinks and a very fun atmosphere.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Great place to bring out of town friends (they too raved about the guac.)"}
{"text":"It is probably not a stretch to say Momocho Mod Mex is the best Mexican restaurant east of the Mississippi.  I am partial to Elote Café in Sedona, AZ  as being the best west of the Mississippi.  That said, I was visiting Cleveland by my lonesome and wanted to try a few hot spot places.  I saw Momocho on Triple D and put it on my list.  I came for happy hour and for less than $25 I had machaca beef tacos (coffee + ancho chile braised beef = yum), guac with gouda, garlic and Ohio honey and a top shelf margarita.   The chile dusted chips warranted another stop to get some to go. If you are a guac fan, you will not be disappointed with the creative combos that they have thought up.   Located in a hip and rehabbed two-story in Ohio City, the space is tight but the atmosphere is eclectic and fun."}
{"text":"Step right up and witness me eating my words!  Momocho redeemed itself for me big time last night.    A few things were different this time going in, so I'm not entirely sure I can consider this a full redemption.  But I still had a great experience. Here goes.  Last time we came at a prime time in the middle of summer.  We waited forever to get our server's attention multiple times.  This time we came for the (early bird) Sunday Night Supper.  Yep, we were there at 4:30.  We beat a 60-year-old couple by a half hour!  YES!  That being said, we were greeted right away, brought right to a table, and were given drink suggestions immediately.  I tried the new Fig Margarita - WOWSA, amazing.  The perfect blend of sweet and tart.  My husband had the margarita sampler...the lush.  He tried pineapple, pomegranate, and traditional.  All delicious.  We ordered the guacamole (as good as I remembered, and one was by FAR enough) and the pineapple/jicama/mint salsa.  I hadn't realized that this was the type of salsa that had no tomato in it, but it was still excellent.  This time we were being watched like hawks with the chips and they were refilled immediately.  The enchiladas!  Muy deliciosas!  I had spinach and my husband had chicken so we could try each other's.  Both perfect.  I think my mistake last time was ordering taquitos (dry, bland, and not so filling) instead of the enchiladas.  But with the Sunday night Supper, you can only order enchiladas for the second course.  Who cares? They were fab.  I really didn't NEED dessert for once, but there it was.  A girnormous disc of flan with a mint sprig in the center.  I don't even like custard desserts and I gobbled this up.  The server was so attentive this time and the place didn't have that \"too-cool\" hipster vibe as much as last time (although that could have been because we were practically the only people in there).    All in all, a much better experience than last time.  Well worth the bill.  My only suggestion would be (as I enjoyed my drink and didn't really want dessert) that they give the option of either a drink OR dessert for the $30/couple.  But that might get tricky if one person wanted dessert and the other didn't, because the flan was clearly an experience meant to be shared."}
{"text":"Dangerous place for the fans of guacamole and margaritas. They are all good dont bother trying to decide order all of them and cancel your plans for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Holy moly what a cow!  Came here on the recommendations of 2 coworkers. Ordered on the recommendations of Yelp!  Wowie!  Came on a Friday night just before 6. Tried to get reservations earlier, but they were booked with walk ins only. Had no problem getting a table.   Service was fast. Started with the margarita sampler and the guacamole sampler.  See pictures for the flavors. Gouda guac and spicy mango marg were favorites.   Entrees came out quickly thereafter. Again, see pics because I can't remember what they were called, but all were good.  Taking half of meal home. Some dude packaged everything up like I bought it at a deli....all guacs remained separated.   Not a cheap meal for two, but enough left over to make it an affordable meal for four. Made one mistake on the check, never brought the side of rice, but that was fixed and no rice was needed for the belly.   Bottom line, you've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointed characterizes my experience with Momocho; that's not to say I totally didn't like it, though.  I was incredibly excited to come here and try the goat cheese guac (if there's goat cheese in it, I don't look at other options--that goes for most menus). It ended up being good and fresh, though I felt it was lacking a little something. I like really onion-y guac, so maybe I was missing that, or perhaps a little more goat cheese blended in would have characterized it more as something that features goat cheese, rather than it tasting like their standard guac with a bit of cheese sprinkled in. I definitely didn't hate it, though, as I hogged it down with those amazing chips!  Those chips! Wow, they were fantastic. I kind of regret getting anything but salsa and guac...heck, I regret not getting salsa at all.   So that's about as far as the things I REALLY liked go.   I had camerones, which was good. The shrimp wasn't overcooked, which was nice, and the sauce they were seriously swimming in was ok. The problem with it was that the peppers and onions mixed in had no flavor at all and the sauce was more like a puddle of flavored oil. We affectionately named them lubri-shrimp and the pineapple and jicama was the best part of my dish in the end!  Needless to say, my entire napkin ended up orange (like the oil) and my fingers were slimy.  I felt lucky and proud of myself that I didn't get any on my dress, but that was changed right at the end of the meal when our waitress came by to give us the check and she clumsily knocked my beer bottle over, which had backwash and about one swig of beer left. It went flying toward me and doused my leg and purse. She didn't even bat an eye at the sound of the glass crashing down on our table (we sat outside, so the tables were metal and clang-y). This wouldn't have been as upsetting (I am a huge clutz and spill all over myself a lot) if she had just blurted out a quick \"sorry\" before running away.   I think if I return, it'll be for some happy hour margaritas and delicious guac (maybe I'll give in and buy some salsa too...though my cheap inner self keeps telling me I shouldn't have to at a Mexican joint). The entrees just don't seem worth it to me."}
{"text":"We started with trio of guac and salsas for the table. The portions on the guac were enormous and they were all good and different with the pineapple jicima being our favorite. Salsa verde was the best of the 3 but didnt really care for the ground pepita one which I was excited about. Tamales with short rib were good and had tons of meat on top. While it is a little pricey, this is great mexican food thats worth the money"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my family and loved it every time! This evening, we had Damion as our server and he was awesome. I asked Damion if he was \"new\" since I hadn't seen him before and he explained that he started in different positions and worked his way up to becoming a server. Bravo to whomever promoted Damion, he's great! The food is always awesome, but it's especially a wonderful visit when you have great service to top it off. My birthday is in two months and I'm hoping to celebrate at Momocho with Damion as our server. Honestly, you can't go wrong  dining here. My eleven year old daughter had (2) orders of the Smoked Gouda Tamale dumplings, in addition to her meal! Love this place!!!!!"}

{"text":"Warning: if your from another state in the US you might not be allowed to order alcoholic drinks even if you are over 21. We arrived from Minnesota today this our first time in Cleveland and wanted to order the margarita flight but even though my boyfriend and I had acceptable Minnesota IDs clearly stating we were both 22 years old, we were told that they hadn't seen MN IDs before and were told we couldn't have any drinks. A restaurant that looks as well-run as this does, should have an ID book that they can look up other states IDs. Disappointing. We left to go to another Mexican restaurant that happily accepted our MN identification (: By the reviews it looks delicious but we're sad we couldn't try it out!"}
{"text":"This was another restaurant that we had found by searching for places to eat at in Cleveland through the food network. We made reservations for the Sunday night that we were in town, and we were lucky enough that the weather was perfect for sitting on the patio.   We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but no big deal. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great at giving recommendations for drinks. As soon as a table opened up we were ushered outside. Our waiter was fantastic, really friendly and also able to give us some recommendations for dinner. We started with the corn, crab and chipotle guac which was to die for. Even the chips that came with it were absolutely delicious.  For dinner I ordered the duck confit tacos and my boyfriend went for the wild boar. Both were fantastic, though we both kind of preferred for the duck. To finish off we shared the mexican fried ice cream. It was absolutely delicious, and a lot larger than we thought - great value and taste for the price paid.   My boyfriend loved their signature cucumber margaritas, and overall we were more than pleased with our whole dinner experience. If we ever found ourselves back in Cleveland... we'd definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The cucumber margaritas and guacamole are yummy. If you go for happy hour, beware to get there early! The bar seats fill up very quickly. There has been more than one occasion where I have walked in and walked out from the crowds but hey that must mean they are doing something right."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out Momocho for awhile now and finally got to last night.  This place did not disappoint!  The margaritas are all great, and the sampler allows you to taste a few if you can't decide.    We had the goat cheese guacamole, which was really good and the chips were perfect.  Most of us got one of the taquitos meals, which were just enough food and deliciousness.  I did try the braised beef entree, which isn't on their online menu right now, and the meat was very tender and had an amazing taste.  The service was great also, but you will need to call about a month ahead of time if you want to get in on a weekend at an actual dinner time.  Pricing is perfect for the service and food you receive.  I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really hyped up. The food is sub-par, lacked flavor, too much salt, and over priced for what you get. We made a reservation in advance, and still had to wait an additional hour. Our waiter was awkward and the atmosphere was just okay. Positives: The drinks are reasonably priced and parking was ample!"}
{"text":"This place did not live up to the hype. The service was sloooow. It took nearly 45 minutes to get chips and guacamole, and the waitress kept saying they are made to order. Fine, but we all knows it doesn't take that long to make either! Once the chips and guac arrived, they were fine, but nothing outstanding. There was one measly piece of bacon in the trout/bacon guac, and the trout was really dry and chewy.  While there are a couple gluten-free taco options, none of the entrees were noted as GF. I tried to ask the waitress what the gluten ingredients were to determine if they could be left out and she very curtly said that the entrees could not be modified. So, I got some sauteed shrimp with pepper and onions (took another 30 min to get these), which didn't have much flavor. It was also loud, and freezing because they had the back door propped open. Based on the mediocre food and bad service, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Basically a boat load full of different delicious guacamoles with fresh made chips along side a margaritta sampler (recommend at least a cucumber one in the three)....I would say this alone would be reason enough to go!  We went for dinner though and the main course is broken down into a selection of the \"do it yourself\" tacittos or the \"assembled\" dishes...I selected the lamb which was very good. Would have liked to try some of the tacittos, but the table was quite small and didnt think I would be able to pull it off. We did go on a Saturday night though, and the place was quite busy...definitely will book ahead next time!  The restuarant has a pretty cool decor and really friendly / knowledgeable staff as well. Overall this was a great place and would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Ohio City over the last ten years has become a hotspot for hipsters. Momocho is no exception, the restaurant is slightly dark with a social ambience. They serve half off tacos from 5pm-6pm, which are delicious but the restaurant is often packed with other guests waiting for seats. The bar offers beers from Mexico which are not often found at restaurants in Northern Ohio, such as Tecate and Modela. The bartender is over the top and very happy, she strives to provide an amazing experience and gives excellent dinner suggestions. The El Pato tacos were divine, as were the sauces that accompanied them. I do not suggest ordering the tamale bites they are a bit dry and bland. Overall I was impressed by Momocho, a great place for singles as well as couples."}
{"text":"Awesome place, you get what you pay for. Great location, outdoor seating. Only bad thing is the noise level can go very high in the dining area downstairs. Very good place for a date. The food is the most important thing in any restaurant, and this place has great food.   The waiter service is excellent. They make you feel welcome and comfortable and always happy to help. I will recommend this place highly to anyone who wants to have a nice evening and Mexican food."}
{"text":"The margaritas were unique and tasty, but overall my group had just an okay time. We were sat outside and our server seldom checked on us. It took him forever to put our order in and by the time we got our drinks the food was on its way too.   The food isn't what you expect. I'd say if you're craving Mexican, this place probably wont satisfy your craving. The food was alright, but not what we had in mind and definitley not worth the price. We especially weren't crazy about the pineapple salsa which was basically just pineapple. We probably won't be headed back to Momocho anytime soon. Not really worth the hype in our opinions."}
{"text":"Delicious, generous tacos. We tried the shrimp, pork belly, carnitas and mahi-mahi and all were excellent. I did not care for the overly sweet margaritas though."}
{"text":"The smoked trout guacamole! Simply amazing. It has a great smoky flavor to it and the trout really sticks out in it's subtlety without overwhelming. It was actually featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives (see link)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCHOELWsWOE  As everybody else has said, it does get extremely busy at opening when patrons are trying to take advantage of the happy hour. We walked in ten or fifteen minutes after opening and got the last open table which had two seats. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious creative Mexican food.  Fresh.  Great upbeat friendly staff.   Best Mexican we had in Cleveland on this trip.  August 2017"}
{"text":"The soundbite version is that this place is the best possible mix of the following attributes:  1. Delicious 2. Cozy, yet stimulating 3. Hip, not \"trendy\" 4. Affordable  Momocho, if I lived in Ohio City, you would be my go-to place.  One day, hopefully we can live out that love affair.  Until then I shall be visiting you frequently from my east side hideaway.  What's driving my enthusiasm?  I suppose I should first explain that I love mexican food.  Momocho serves up mexican-fusion that is super fresh and non-greasy (as far as this type of fare is usually concerned).  I was there with two of my lady friends and we split a few small plates - which was way more than enough food (read: we're all good eaters and still took home 2 doggie bags).  1. guacamole / goat cheese / tomato / chile poblano 2. chile poblanao relleno / smoked gouda / chile guajillo / tomato sauce 3. pato / slow roasted duck / pomegranate ancho barbacoa 4. alcachofa / sofrito artichokes + goat cheese / pico de gallo  Word to the wise: this place gets packed on the weekends (which I consider a good thing - yay for local business!).  Make a reservation if you can.  And stick around for a nice after dinner tequilla - their list is quite ample and this spot is just a great place to hang out.  I hear they have a nice patio, but, it was pouring the night we were there.  I'm actually glad to have eaten inside - the interior is beautifully designed and it's clear that whoever was in charge of the design took the details very seriously."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant after seeing it on Food Network. I didn't realize how tiny it was. The wait was long and there wasn't much seating. My waitress did not come around often. The menu was slightly high priced for what you got. The portion size was a little smaller than average. The food was delicious though."}
{"text":"Super FantasticO!  Guac with Blue Cheese and Garlic Confit Great!  Spinach Chile Relleno was delicious!  The Especial Margarita was delightful.  We were lucky enough to sit outside with the vivacious Alicia as our server. Great decor and very cool relaxed vibe.  If you are in the land of Cleve this place is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, very small and amazing atmosphere. My friend and I made a meal out of the guacamole sampler and the smoked trout was out of this world. They combine so many amazing flavors together. I am definitely planning on going back to try their entrees. Oh and the margarita sampler was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Sunday Night Dinner!!   This was my second time ordering off the Sunday Night Dinner menu but my first time dining on the patio.   The Sunday Night Dinner Menu is meant to be shared between two for $30 total. The menu gives the option of salsa/guac, enchiladas, and flan. It is a great \"deal\" and takes the work out of ordering. Last night we sat on the patio, awesome, and went with the spinach enchilada option. I have had the chicken enchiladas before, and although yummy, the spinach kicked butt. The blood orange margaritas were to die for. As usual, the service was perfect."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk to go here.  The food and drinks are amazing. Truly authentic Mexican food that is affordable and tasty. Everything is freshly prepared and it shows. Even the guacamole interpretations have a distinctly authentic feel.  The drinks are all made with the highest quality mixers; no roses lime juice here."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Momocho for quite some time so I am glad I finally did.  On a Wednesday night the place was packed.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table but after that wait times crept up to 30 minutes or so.  The menu is full of big, bold flavors.  Translation:  if you have a sissy stomach, skip this place.  I like my food fiery and bold (like my men) and this place delivered heat with a side of heat and I loved every bite.  The Machaca (ancho and coffee braised brisket) was simply awesome.  The chicken (forget the name) was downright delicious. Garlic and blue cheese guacamole is head and shoulders above the Michael Symon recipe that Lopez serves (on the East side of town).  And Momocho's guacamole is fresh unlike Lopez which has been tasting tired lately.  I digress...The only ding I give Momocho is the service was s-l-o-w.  But lucky for me I was with my boyfriend and we weren't in a hurry.  Cannot wait to go back!  Arriba."}
{"text":"The guacamole and food here are amazing!  I honestly don't know how their guacamole is so much better than mine.  The atmosphere is also really cool.  It is a fun place to go with friends or on a date.    The reason for the 4 stars is it is a little pricey and the happy hour is limited to only the downstairs.  I would call ahead for a table if you want to go there for happy hour.  When I was there last there were numerous reserved unoccupied tables downstairs that were reserved so I had to pay full price upstairs."}
{"text":"A birthday celebration prompted a visit to this famous Cleveland mod-mex establishment. From the drinks to the apps, to the entrees, everything was on point! My group and I split 2 margarita samplers and guacomole appetizer (goat cheese, pecorino, and pineapple). For the entree, I went with the chile relleno, which is an entree I use as a bench mark for all mexican restaurants in the area.   The drinks were some of the best I (and the group) have ever had; the guac appetizer was fresh, perfectly seasoned and was gone in about 10 minutes. The Chile Relleno was perfectly portioned and was not too oily, a common problem this dish suffers from at many mexican restaurants. The service was phenomenal, with our server Damian entertaining us with his humorous personality and addressing any requests we had. His complete understanding of the menu and all the flavor profiles from the drinks to the entrees, was a welcome addition to the phenomenal food! The overall atmosphere and great service made the entire experience worthwhile.   I have absolutely no quips about this restaurant. Parking is easy to find in the surrounding streets. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation though =) Good eating!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Momocho, but unfortunately, this experience just didn't deliver. The hostess was really nice and squeezed in a table for us on New Years eve, and then proceeded to seat us immediately when we came in. However, the experience did go downhill from there.   We got our tables close to 7:45, by which time the restaurant was not as busy as earlier in the evening. However, it took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to get the attention of any server (despite me waving at one). The drink orders were decent and the guacamole was pretty good, however the chips serving was not very much - just an average sized bowl. This would not have been an issue if they were not charging $8.50 for a guacamole serving, and $2 for each chip refill.   For the main course ordered the Chilli Relleno, which was pretty good, a beetroot Taco dish which was ok, and their best beef tacos, which, honestly were tough. We've had more tender meat at a Taco Bell.  Overall, it seemed like a place that had potential. There were definitely sparks of greatness (Cucumber Margarita and Chilli Rellenos). However, the overall experience just was not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I hate chains. And hearing the buzz about Momocho after returning home from Italy, I was anxious to try this local establishment in trendy Ohio City.  OK, so the guac is good. And they offer a great selection of Tequila. The busers are great. And the handful of unaffected servers are good, But beyond that...meh.  The food tastes like chain food only 2X more expensive.  It's food for lefties - who would never be caught dead eating lowbrow Tex-Mex - and so flock in droves to dine on this unimaginative, overseasoned \"mod-mex\" (which is neither) solely because they believe they are being fashionable and hip by doing so. It doesn't matter that the food sucks, it's important that they're able to say they were there, with other liberals, NOT eating Tex-Mex.  There is no justifiable gastronomical excuse for dining here, unless you like proteins served at incorrect temps after being subjected to incoherent use of spice then oddly paired with sides which have been likewise ill-cooked and strangely spiced. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in America and around the world. I have also eaten in some of the worst. This is not one of the best.  Go here for guacamole and tequila. Then leave."}
{"text":"This restaurant was beyond disappointing. We waited an hour for appetizers (prior to even being seated), then another hour and a half for our dinner, which was mediocre at best. They were not accommodating for our stroller after promising us via phone that they would be. Will not be returning. Don't waste your time, staff is obnoxious and pompous for no reason and food is meh."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I would say: mixed bag. Definitely go if you're in Cleveland and looking for a hip place that serves interesting food. Don't let the really negative reviews keep you away. It's worth trying, and there are some real high points. But don't let all of the high ratings on Yelp lull you into the sense that this will be without-a-doubt a great evening.   The vibe: it's hip and cool. Downstairs is definitely hipper and cooler than upstairs. Eat at the bar if you can.  The drinks: margaritas are excellent. Momocho's serves Mexican beers, which is what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant, right? The beer they serve, though, isn't all that. The beer list is okay but not memorable.  The food: overall, very good. Try the smoked gouda dumplings. Delicious! The salsa is pretty good. The guacamole is really really good. I ordered the tuna tacos and was pleased -- not blown away. The tuna was well-prepared and the sauces were tasty.It just didn't knock my socks off.  The service: the people who work here are very accommodating, but they also seem understaffed. Our waiter forgot our appetizer (boo!) but gave us a free round of drinks to make up for it (yay!). We showed up earlier than our rezzies (bad on us) but the host seated us early (pretty amazing).   I'd definitely go again, with lowered expectations."}
{"text":"I really liked the guacamole and original dishes as well as the homey authentic feel of the restaurant. The bar has outstanding drinks and you're bound to find something you like here. However, I do feel that the restaurant is very hyped up for what it really is. For this type of food, I would recommend Paladar at Eaton instead."}
{"text":"The guacamole was awesome.  We tried 3 kinds.  The crab habanero guacamole was excellent.   Blood orange margarita was tasty.   Chili relleno stuffed with spinach and cheese was flavorful. Really enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"We got reservations same day (Thursday), which seems to have been a problem for previous yelpers.  The trifecta of guacamole is delicious but can be filling if you have a small group.  Margaritas were tasty, but pre-made and a bit on the sweet side. The house habanero sauce is killer-good and plenty hot.  I bought one to take home.  Went to this place as a recommendation from Diners, Drive-inns and Dives yet it did not appear to be any of those things.  All the wall art was awesome! I love lucha libre pictures, art and masks."}
{"text":"Very impressive dining experience. The service was top-notch - our server knew everything and answered our preguntas and suggested some very tasty options.  Of course, I didn't get the scallops in the jalapeno creamed corn - has to be the best thing on that menu. The lady did. I ordered the camarones taquitos. Nothing to see here, folks. Only some delicious sauces, light, warm corn tortillas and some lovely, perfectly seasoned and cooked shrimp. It didn't look like much on the plate, but I was full when I finished.  The crab and pickled corn guacamole was just what was needed on this night. Not too much or too little of anything. Would have eaten more if they would have brought it. And those made-to-order chips... Mercy.  The lady tried the margarita sampler. Also lots of fun. Especially that cucumber one with the salt and pepper. Hoh boy. Never had anything like it. It was so mellow and clean-tasting. I'll have a whole drink next time."}
{"text":"My new favorite Ohio city restaurant in Cleveland. Fantastic experience started with our waiter Damien who knew his stuff!!!  Welcoming friendly and very knowledgeable w/o being a pest. Great menu choices- loved short rib tamales and the porkbelly dish. Flavors are awesome and unique decor makes Momocho a winner!!!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Guacamole was amazing! The rest of the food was only mediocre. Have to see we were disappointed ! Not your typical Triple DDD quality. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great Food and Margaritas also a must try is the Guac...def be back soon for some Margaritas on a hot summer day... Also had the pork chop.. Great recommendation by our server..."}
{"text":"I get the lamb tamales every time I go because first I don't go too often but second they are freaking awesome!!! Also the margarita sampler is delicious and very versatile in the dynamic of the flavors!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: trendy & modern Mexican-inspired fare.  When I came to visit Cleveland, my guides put Momocho down as a must-go. It's been racking up a storm of kudos from every end of the area, and I was excited to experience it.  Located a bit off the beaten track, Momocho is housed in an old duplex and sports high-top tables and a bar. [Note: the staff are great but the building itself is not super wheelchair-friendly. Two small steps up the front walk and the lowest table they have is not low enough for most chairs. The owner personally said they're looking for new locations for this reason.] We had reservations at 5PM when they opened and they were packed from that time on. The decor is neat, with pictures of lucha libres lining the walls as well as other knick-knacks.  The waiters were young and energetic, but not in an annoying way. I started with a glass of their Don Julio Anejo tequila ($9). Two fingers of tequila served with a couple of lemon slices peppered with cinnamon. Fantastic combination, and their extensive selection was really the highlight for me.  Our group of three started with the Sampler of guacamole (~$21), which is three bowls from a number of choices. We chose Tradicional; Goat cheese, Tomato, Chile Poblano; and Smoked Trout, Bacon, Chile Poblano. Be aware that this is a TON of guac. At a minimum have three people to finish it. As we ordered the Sampler, our waiter asked if we'd like a side of salsa too. Of course we said yes. He never mentioned that this was an extra $3.50 for the small bowl of salsa verde.  The tradicional was bland but for mixing with the salsa verde. The goat cheese guac was good if you got a chunk of the cheese, but otherwise bland as well. The smoked trout was the best, though I don't believe there was any bacon whatsoever in ours. Still, very good. The salsa verde was just okay. The chips were warm and plentiful.  We also ordered the Smoked Gouda Tamale Dumplings for the table, but they weren't brought out until the entrees. I truly don't understand what the other reviews ordered, because ours were just not good. They weren't bad, we ate all four, but they literally had no taste whatsoever.  I was excited to order the Chanco taquitos. A dish with braised boar piled on some pickled jalapeno and onions came with a side of salsa verde and mustard crema and some flour tortillas. I liked that their tortillas are small so you can make mini taquitos; easier to eat. But I'm a mustard guy, and I found the mustard crema not great (a bit TOO creamy). What made the dish for me was actually stealing the habanero-chipotle from Katie K.'s meal and adding it to mine.   We ended the meal with Mecican Fried Ice Cream ($4). It's a giant ball of ice cream covered in cornflakes and peanut butter then fried and drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream. It was better than I expected, and the ice cream itself was extremely creamy.  This place has so much potential. It's hip, it's unique, and it's trying. But while the food pairings are certainly modern, different doesn't make them tasty. I think Momocho will continue to do well, but I hope they mix their menu up a bit and add some more spice. Keep up the good work with the tequila, though."}
{"text":"From now on, every time I think of Ohio, Momocho will be the first thing that comes to mind. I would say this is one of the best things Ohio has to offer and thanks to my Yelp community, I was able to discover and enjoy it. As you all know, I am a complete sucker for some good Mexican food and this place is no joke. Momocho experiments with funky guacamole flavors using ingredients like goat cheese, pineapple, bacon, white chocolate and smoked trout. They think outside the box and I like it! They also have a full list of classic taquitos and they're very well known for their tasty margarita samplers. Is your mouth watering already?  I am pretty convinced that Momocho is the coolest place in Ohio City, so if you haven't been yet, you are most definitely missing out. They are open Tuesday through Sunday for dinner and drinks at 1835 Fulton Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44113. Dinner for two with a margarita sampler, appetizer and two entrees is around $80 including tip. It's straight up delicious, so be sure to check it out soon. I promise, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food here was off the chart! I got here for happy hour and they offer half price Gold Margs, and Tecate beer. The Taquitos are also 50% off! Score! I had the guac with the goat cheese and poblano peppers. The guac was excellent with the house made chips! I had the Chancho (boar) taquitos with the mustard crema.   If you're going for dinner be sure to make reservations. I waited 20 mins for a seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"Momocho is pretty much what you would expect from an upscale sit-down taco eatery, and although I've had tastier tacos at a ton of other places, it was a good dining experience.  The interior is small and intimate, and felt almost like an eclectic neighborhood dive bar.  Food wise, the tacos were good, but nothing to write home about.  Take advantage of the happy hour if you plan on eating the taquitos, as they are $9 from 5:00 - 6:30 I believe. The real stars of the meal for me were the guac sampler (definitely a must order) and the queso.  I was pleasantly surprised that neither of these items, nor the chips for that matter, were overly salted.    I want to note that we had one of the friendliest and helpful servers (without being intrusive and over the top) that I can recall.  I can't remember his name, but props to him for being a genuinely nice dude."}
{"text":"5 stars for real, duh.   we showed up at 4pm. (it doesn't even open until five) that's how excited we were. that said, we are not scared to throw water on a bonfire, if an over-hyped restie is our dining destination of choice i am the first one to point out the many flaws it contains.  tonight is not such a night.  as i mentioned we were 60 american minutes early to the doors opening, we were lucky enough, however, to see the 2-time James Beard nominee chef/owner outside taking a nicotine break who was kind enough to recommend a bar close by for a pre-cocktail.  - side note, um sirs? what else are you looking for? give this guy his prize already.-  so we are there 30 seconds after they open the doors. literally.  we took seats at the bar by the server well (when i called on Wed their reservations were booked until 9 pm EST- so get thyself to the phone now). our bartender greeted us quickly and cheerfully and w/in mere moments we had our margarita flight.  we had the tradicional, pineapple and blood orange. they were all amazing in their own right. the pineapple seemed dangerous because the tequila was so toned down by the syrupy sweetness of the pineapple you could drink a 1000 of them, just fyi. the amazingly helpful and kind bartender also added a 4th glass to our flight. the cucumber marg. holy balls. that's the real deal holyfield. I had wanted that in the first place but my buddy doesn't do cucumber so i bypassed it. it's not just the contrast between the cool and round (taste, not shape) cucumber balancing the tequila, it's also the habanero lime salt. (i made up the habanero part, it's some sort of pepper and lime salt that is red, spicy and acidic, the greatest rim of all time) not only were the drinks good; that kind of attention to service was noted, appreciated and now lauded.  to the food.  we ordered the guacamole sampler. tradicional, pineapple, and crab & pickled corn. the tradicional was amazing. i could have eaten that for a long, long time. the pineapple was the tradicional with small pineapple chunks. it was enough to change it. that little bit of crazy sweet completely changed the bowl. the final, crab and corn, had an overriding seafood flavor that was wonderful, but definitely played second fiddle to the aforementioned. ~note- if you order the sampler please be aware that it is a full serving of three different guacs. that is to say it is a shit-ton of guac. worth it, but pace yourself.  so, we got taquitos for dinner. not that box you get in the frozen aisle of the grocery. this is a bowl of flavorful amazingness, sauce, salsa and tortillas. think glorified fajitas.  He got carnitas. the flavor was beyond. sweet, acidic, savory, all that is good and wonderful in this world. served with a habanero-chipotle (swoon) sauce and tomatillo salsa.  (i was eating the tomatillo salsa with a spoon. that's how amazing it is)  I got the special, mole braised short ribs w/ a horseradish sauce and the same tomatillo salsa.  it was like butter in texture. that is to say it was the best texture of meat you could ever hope to have on your fork and tongue.  i will say i didn't get a lot of mole out of it, and i have had Bayless' mole, i know mole. doesn't matter. they were still crazy good.  i also got some sort of goat cheese tamale cake thing. comfort food at its finest. i want a thousand of those fried corn puffs.  we were there for 2.5 hours and never felt anything but welcomed by the bartenders. the food was so, so, so good.   i closed the night w/ a cup of coffee as we live 45 minutes from Momocho. it is crazy good. some sort of vietnames cinnamon (i didn't make that up) and something that is the most flavorful coffee of all time.   i also have gone from a manatee stomach to a blue whale sized stomach (that's the largest living mammal) because i ate so much. we took our guac home because we didn't come close to finishing it, and i am 'this' close to getting in there w/ a spoon right now. it's just so good. i don't even feel like a jerk for eating as much as i did because it is happy meat and real food.   also:  i need you to know that i'm from OK. a state that is nearly 40% hispanic (that's a made-up stat, but it's probably true) which means i have had my fair share of good mexican food.   this is good mexican food on anabolic steroids.   is it cheating? jesus says not to judge. i say just enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is good, the quac is amazing, the place is super tiny so you are going to have to wait.  The quac alone is worth the wait to experience it."}
{"text":"Had happy hour drinks and light appetizers here while spending a night in Cleveland. Their standard margaritas are excellent (simply, not too sweet) and a total steal during happy hour. They have some creative guacamole - we tried one with goat cheese and chile poblano and love it. Also had the al pastor taquito (braised pork, pineapple salsa) which was great. This place seems to be well known and was packed very early; make a reservation if you can or simply plan to have a drink while you wait for a bar spot to open up."}
{"text":"Me and the BF had date night at Momocho and it was great! I'm a big fan of Mexican food so I was really excited to try it out. The inside is like creepy mexican decorations mixed with Mexican wrestling decorations. It's dark and intimate (seriously it's pretty small, but not crowded/cramped, it's perfect)  They have a huge variety of guacamole. I'm not a big guac fan (gasp! I know, I'm a freak) but I loved Momocho guac, so they must be doing something right! I also got a margarita and I asked them to mix the pineapple and pomegranate flavors, which they were happy to do and it was delicious. My BF got the cucumber margarita (I think it's their signature drink) and it was so refreshing! I could def sip on that in the summer!  I got the little pescado tacos (sorry I forget their real name). I thought they were really light but still filling, which is what I was hoping for and it was great. I nibbled on what my BF got, but I forget what that was called too. However, since both were so tasty, I think it's safe to say that Momocho just always makes delicioso food!  I'll definitely go back and I can't wait until I do! (Hopefully I'll remember a little more to include in my review that time around...)  Make sure you make a reservation like a day in advance because, like I said, it's really small and tasty."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Tuesday night and they had a 1 hour wait line. Fortunately we were able to snag a spot at the bar straight away. Took some time to get the bartenders attention for a order but he was honestly just slammed and trying to keep up best he could. We did order the guacamole sampler with crab, trout and Gouda. If you haven't had this then I would highly recommend it as the guac is all amazing and the different flavorings really offer some awesome selections for your taste buds. My only other recommendation for the guac sampler is show up with at least two people who are ravenously hunger because it's almost a meal in and of itself.... for my main dish I had the pork adobo barriga taquitos. The bartender recommended a fried egg on top which, unless you are talking desert, almost never sounds like a bad idea. The plate was basically a mini skillet with a side of mini corn tortillas and tasted fabulous. Everything about the meal was very satisfying and the total tab (including 1 mojito) came out to 72$ with tip. Really not too bad if you are on a date night type setup. The only thing about this place that kind of played against it was it's space on the inside. It was very small and cramped and you could certainly call it cozy if you'd like but I felt a bit uncomfortable for the meal because of being shoulder to shoulder for the entire meal. Even behind us there was only enough room for one person to either get between us/stand and the next seated table. Just a very small venue. On the plus side of this though the kitchen really cranks out the orders as they are obviously trying to turn over the tables as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my top five restaurants in Cleveland.  The food is amazing, the ambiance is amazing, the staff is amazing. They have samplers of both margaritas and guacamole- get the goat cheese guac, you won't regret it. My favorite thing on the menu is the mahi mahi tacos, but everything is delicious and the prices are great for what you are getting. My only suggestion is to make a reservation, this place gets pretty packed and although two people can snag a seat - you might have to wait a while."}
{"text":"I really like Momocho. Somehow I never heard of Momocho but a friend from Austin mentioned they saw it featured on Food Channel. We tried the guacamole which was fresh and excellent. Then some tacos to finish the meal. All was excellent and we will be back. Eating outside on the patio with some beers and the food provided for a food eventing. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Momocho was delish! But there was o h.  s o.  m u c h. FOOD!  I had been meaning to try Momocho for the looooongest time and was finally able to make a trip to the hip Ohio City location, at last, for a bestie's bday celebración (had to throw in a lil' Spanish flare, lol).  I can't say much for parking (the girls got dropped off at the door), but I did see a lot right next door to the building, which is where the boys parked and we could see our vehicle from the upstairs window (yay for those of you who are paranoid about break-ins!).  When I walked in, I was at first transported back to a time when this location had once been \"Fulton Bar & Grill\" - it looked sorta the same, with the exception of a really sweet Mexican wrestler somewhat voodoo-y looking theme going on. The place is dimly lit (loves me some mood lighting) with a good vibe and ambiance. I could definitely see this being a great place for a group soiree and/or an intimate locale for a private one on one date with your sweetie.   Word to the wise: Make early reservations, lets say at least a week ahead of time (or a couple of days if you're feeling lucky) - they fill up quick and from what I was told, they make their reservations based on a two hour dining experience.  After reading review after review on Yelp touting the amaaaaazing margaritas, I immediately ordered up a trio sampler; Blood Orange, Pineapple, and Ginger Fruit Punch. Each was delish, like a little slice of margarita heaven. Two more full size margaritas followed - a Pineapple and a Ginger Fruit, so I had a nice buzz going on. Our waitress, who was absolutely fab and helpful, even brought us a sample of the Spicy Mango margarita because we were too afraid to try it. It was equally as amazing as my other choices - it was very sweet at first and then tempered down to a slight heat after a few seconds. It will be one of my selections on the next trip. I have to note that I saw everyone says the Cucumber margarita is delish, and one of my dining mates sipped one down and agreed, but I just can't get behind the cool cucumber taste in a drink, I guess I'm just weird.  As we moved on to dinner selections, I'll admit I felt like an idiot when trying to decipher what exactly was being offered on the menu - even after four years of Spanish in high school, I was lost when trying to determine what I thought \"bocaditas,\" \"cazuela-style,\" and \"antojitos\" meant - but I made it through and managed to order some amazing culinary cuisine.   We started off with some traditional guacamole served with housemade corn tortilla chips - divine! My comida (food) of choice was the Pibil (braised pork with annatto seed and banana leaf, served with delicious honey-chile chipotle mojo). This entree is served \"cazuela-style\" with warm corn tortillas and salsa verde on the side. The boy toy ordered the pork chop (which is served with oaxacan red chile and chocolate mole with a side of smoked gouda tamale dumplings). We both were very pleased.  By the time dessert came around, I was crazy full but decided to try to squeeze down some fried ice cream (who can resist cornflake and peanut coating?!). Our table was also lucky enough to try the capirotada (which is gingersnap and jalapeno bread pudding served with burnt sugar and whipped cream). I know you think - jalapeno in bread pudding? Weird. But no, it was an intriguing taste combination. I also indulged in some Mexican coffee, spiced with cinnamon and brown sugar - it was heavenly even without any cream.  Definitely a fan of Momocho and will return.   Oh! Forgot to mention a bit of important notes - bathrooms (there's two) both single stall and both on the first floor, weren't dirty during my visit, so kudos Momocho. And if you're unable to get up stairs - make sure you let them know when you make your reservation - there's a good number of steep stairs to get up to the second level, so it might be hard with a pair of 5 inch stilettos on. ;)"}
{"text":"Our most favorite Cleveland restaurant! Cucumber margaritas are where it's at, people! Actually, any of their homemade, flavored margaritas are simply delish. The guac of choice is goat cheese with bacon OMG!, but I love all the varieties. All the taquitos are amazing, except for the chicken. Favorites are the carnitas and the machaca. The black beans, green beans and pickled onions are all must have sides. Oh and the coffee- brown sugar, cinnamon, cuban coffee- heavenly!"}
{"text":"Overall: Appetizers, drinks, ambience, and service were all thumbs up, but the taquito entrees fell flat. I may give this place another try if I am in the area. However, I have generally come to the conclusion that I personally don't like \"modern\" takes on ethnic food. Usually ethnic food is so amazing that it doesn't need to be dressed up, or doled out in small portions on fancy plates.  Food: The guacamole with goat cheese was by far the best guacamole that I've had. Unfortunately, the taquitos were nothing special. Our table got the pork belly, wild boar, beef brisket, and shrimp taquitos. They all tasted good, but nothing particularly stood out in terms of bold flavor. The protein portions were also a bit small.   Drinks: The margarita sampler was good. I had the blood orange, pomegranate, and cucumber flavors, which were all refreshing. They accidentally also gave us the red bell pepper, which I didn't care for (thats why I hadn't ordered it to begin with).  The samplers were much larger than I expected - about 6-7 ozs of liquid in each. There was also a fair amount of tequila in each.  Service: Our server was very friendly, and prompt with drink refills. The taquitos didn't come out until about an hour after we had been seated, but we had been warned beforehand that reservations were based on a 2-hr dining experience. It didn't bother us too much because we had the guacamole, margarita sampler, and good company to bide us over.  Ambience: Modern and trendy, but intimate."}
{"text":"So good I don't know where to start.  Service was excellent  The food was  spectacular.  Starting wIth the MARGARITA and guacamole sampler! From there it was all up hill."}
{"text":"Momocho's happy house menu (which is usually when I tend to come) is fab! Half off taquitos and margaritas, what more can you ask of a Mexican place! The design inside with pictures and candles, as well as dim lighting gives off a great feel for the place. I had the beef brisket, my friend had the Mahi mahi, and last time I was in here I had the pork belly tacquito and I've come to the conclusion that you really can't go wrong with any of them. Margaritas are tasteful and very sweet. If you love Mexican, you will love this small little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Delicious. Found out about it from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It is none of those, but it was fantastic! On the trip through Cleveland we decided to stop here. Unfortunately, it didn't open until 5pm, so we waited four hours for dinner. It was well worth the wait. We sat outside on the large patio, it was a beautiful day in Cleveland (yes, it happens). The service was very good and helpful with what to order and how large the portions are. The machaca, coffee and ancho braised beef was amazing!!! Also, enjoyed the goat cheese guac and chips. The camerones (shrimp in a garlic wine sauce) was delicious. Dessert was fried ice cream. It was fantastic. More than enough for two people and very satisfying. The machaca and fried ice cream are must orders when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!  Cucumber margarita is wonderful. I don't even like guacamole but for some reason I eat theirs.  The sea scallops are out of this world, I get them every time I go!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back for the guacamole sampler and the margaritas!  Last time I was there I got the Cucumber Margarita which was refreshing and delicious and 3 guacamole's to share with my group.  We got one with pineapple, salmon, and cream cheese.  All were great but I think the salmon was my favorite.  My entree and dessert were nothing to write home about but the Margaritas and Guac are the best I have ever experienced!  Make a reservation, the place is pretty busy and not very big."}
{"text":"The waiter was nice. The food was good, but way overpriced. I split chips and salsa and had a full order of taquitos, but still left hungry. They also will not break up a check, but will split it 50-50, which is strange. I personally will not be back."}
{"text":"I would just love to bathe in their guacamole.  All of it's good, but some is more spicy than others.  There's nothing better than chasing down a few tacos with an ice cold Pacifico!  A fantastic date spot with an extra casual feel.  I recommend sitting at the bar whenever possible -- they do have a patio.  Also, plan ahead for parking or use a rideshare app.  The lot is usually full during the rush and you may not get a table if you're driving around looking for parking."}
{"text":"Awesome food, drinks, and wait staff.  I have to say, they serve some of the best margaritas I've ever had in the country.  They're unique flavors that you will not find at your local Chevys, Appplebees, TGI Fridays, Taco Bell, or even authentic mexican restaurants.  I highly recommend the hibiscus and pa'bango margaritas along with a third to complete your margarita sampler.  The appetizers are off the hook, especially the queso fundido.  I enjoyed the taco I got put also enjoyed some of the entrees I've had there.  As far as dessert goes, their flan is unbelievable; this is coming from a guy that typically detests the texture and taste of most flan.   It is sometimes tough to get a table there, but only because it's one of the hottest and best places to eat when in Cleveland.  Definitely go there if you're a group, but for a date it's not the best because it can get really loud in there."}
{"text":"***I am not a huge fan of Mexican cuisine so I'm not sure if Momocho is the right restaurant for me; still, it feels more like a Border Grill than a Rivera or Playa (the menu at Momocho is much hipper and more creative than Border Grill though; less expensive too)***  I am not a huge fan of Mexican food so I am probably not the best judge of a place like Momocho.  Momocho is an upscale Mexican restaurant in Cleveland that is very well regarded (it was a James Beard semifinalist).  The restaurant is also hugely popular.  There was a line at the door when they opened.  They have three seating areas: an upstairs dining area, a bar area and a patio.  During the week, they do a happy hour where the taquitos are 50% off.  Their taquitos appear to be one of their signature items (great fillings like braised pork belly, duck confit, and coffee and ancho braised beef brisket).  They also feature several varieties of guacamole as well as some starters, modern entrees and sides.  I tried several of their guacamoles including their traditional one, a goat cheese one with tomato and chile poblano, and a smoked trout one with bacon and chile poblano.  For me, guacamole can often be bland and I felt that was the case with their traditional one though it was creamy, cool and refreshing.  I prefer a spicier variation on guacamole (like the Indian butter at Rivera in LA).  The smoked trout with bacon guacamole had a noticeable bacon flavor (as well as a crunch from the bacon).  The trout kind of got lost in it (trout can be a mild fish).  The guacamole with goat cheese had a great tangy flavor from the goat cheese that was good.  The chips were good--crispy, light and not salty.  For my entree, I had the smoked trout and crab chilaquiles, which were tostadas layered with smoked trout and crab as well as beans.  The dish was topped with a tomatillo verde, cotija cheese and a fried egg.  There were good parts of the chilaquiles.  The crab was good.  Though it was unevenly applied, the crab was moist and fresh.  You also get more of the smokiness from the trout here than you do with the smoked trout guacamole.  The tostadas also maintained a fair amount of crispiness despite being drenched in tomatillo verde.  I thought the heavy use of the tomatillo verde kind of made all the other ingredients shine less though.  Whether traditional or not, I think Gallo Blanco Cafe's chilaquiles (Phoenix) are a much more satisfying version of chilaquiles.  They use less sauce, but their sauce is still very potent so you get the flavor and intensity with each bite.  Also, the more subtle use of the sauce allows the ingredients like the crispy tostada, the fried egg and the protein to stand out more.  For dessert, I had the Mexican chocolate flan.  Because chocolate melts at a different temperature than other ingredients, I think the flan became less of a flan and more like a dense chocolate mousse (almost like a flourless cake).  The flan definitely had the right flavor--with spicy and chocolate notes.  I liked the caramel topping, which was more flan like in texture.  They also used some salt to keep the dish from becoming too sweet.  The lack of the right texture for the chocolate though kept me from liking this dessert.  Service was very good.  The owner and staff were friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, polite, and attentive.  Prices were reasonable.  Momocho seems to be a good deal for happy hour, but their regular menu prices are still not too bad for upscale Mexican cuisine.  Their entrees are substantial and they go no higher than the low $20s.  I wonder if ordering differently may have resulted in a much better dining experience (their pork chop looked very good).  Even if I ordered differently though, I am not sure if I could ever really love Momocho since I am just not a big fan of Mexican cuisine.  From what I had, I would not put Momocho in the same category as good-to-very-good upscale Mexican restaurants like John Sedlar's Rivera and Playa.  To me, Momocho felt more like a Border Grill with lower prices and more creativity in their menu.  I think if you are a fan of Mexican cuisine and find yourself in the Cleveland area, you should check out Momocho.  While it might not be the restaurant for me, it might be the restaurant for you.  Momocho has a few parking spaces.  You can also find free parking on the street."}
{"text":"We made reservations at Momocho for my birthday dinner, as it came highly recommended by two of my friends. We were seated upstairs at a romantic table. The whole place is quite small, but cozy and inviting. We wanted a relaxing dining experiences, hoping to take our time. We started with margaritas. I got the classic, which was excellent, and my husband ordered the mango margarita. He liked it but I thought it was a bit sweet. We ordered the guacamole sampler, which was very generous in portion size. My favorite was the goat cheese guacamole - who would have that would be so delicious? We split the shrimp tacos for an entree. So why the four stars and not five? Our server was not particularly attentive. Although we did want a relaxed dining experience, after we ordered our guacamole, she did not come back to the table and we had to ask another server to get her attention. Probably would have ordered more had we had better service. Regardless, it would be worth visiting again."}
{"text":"The food, salsas, and drinks are WOW!!  We went twice in one week when we first discovered Momocho.  ALL of it was EXCELLENT!!  The service was even great - considerate, polite and efficient wait staff."}
{"text":"Another gem hidden away. This place has awesome margaritas! I had the trio and drank them all. Guacamole was great and so was the service."}
{"text":"Had an amazing waiter and delicious food. Margarita pitcher, guacamole sampler and the pork chop were the best choices I made in a long time."}
{"text":"Overrated and understaffed. Waited 2 hours for our food. P. S. Don't come when it's hot out, they have no AC. The food, however, is really good. Too bad we could not get desert."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. The food was ok and it's way overpriced.  We had one guacamole (nothing special) ,  martini sampler, two entrees, and one ice cream and the bill came $78 before tips. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere really makes this place.  A great date place.  Best part of it is that it also does really well as a neighborhood joint.  The food is taste as well.  I definitely recommend the Sunday Night Supper menu.  It'll give you an app and desert to share along with a lovely meal.  The guac and salsa verde are to die for."}
{"text":"The Guac is amazing- we had blue cheese one. My tacos were just okay but my boyfriend got the pork belly ones which OMG were ONE OF THE BEST THINGS IVE EVER ATE would have rated 5 stars if my meat wasn't dry. Eclectic atmosphere, good drinks - strong but not over powering"}
{"text":"Definite 5 star place! Coming from LA had very little expectations for CLE Mexican food but this place is fantastic. Definitely a good place for groups and some of the best guacamole around. Also their Margarita sampler is excellent choice. Try the cucumber and spicy mango margaritas.   This place makes me wonder why I cant get this type of Mexican food in LA! If your looking for a giant portion of refried beans and red rice this is not your place.  If you want great food and sides definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Amazing entree. That braised short rib tamales . Guac was okay but not as good as barrio imho. Flavored marcs were quite delish. In general the place was legit but overpriced"}
{"text":"Great evening.  Brought our 3 teens for real Mexican food, they loved it.  Problem is now they don't want to eat at the traditional Mexican places so I better start making more money.  That said we ordered apps, dinner, and a large fried ice cream.  Wife and I had 1 drink and they were special/homemade originals.   Highly recommend this place.  I loved it so much I bought a shirt."}
{"text":"Went to Momocho after hearing good things. Very cute atmosphere. The food is delicious. We got the goat cheese guac, which was awesome. I can speak for the deconstructed taquitos - we had pescado and beef - both great. I was disappointed with the margaritas. We order flights ($15), which left a lot to be desired. I'd have to say the hibiscus margarita was probably one of the worst I've ever had (and I've had a lot). Too sweet, with a weird after taste. Do not order the strawberry mint one. The mint flavoring was like toothpaste. Maybe it was too much to expect a real mint leaf? The mint syrup they used was not good at all. My friend did have the cucumber margarita, which seemed like they used real, muddled cucumbers. Even with the drinks, I would go back again and would recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing, totally worth all the hype and the $. Happiest food coma ever, take me back there!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place but it's extremely overpriced and left little to be desired.  The only part of the meal I enjoyed was the guacamole.  I agree with another reviewer's comment that our server did not make any effort to advocate for dishes.  I felt the service was also very slow."}
{"text":"Margaritas are fresh and delicious - Not syrupy. Red bell pepper and cucumber were our favorite. Food was also fantastic. Trout guacamole and pork belly taquitas."}
{"text":"Make a reservation! Went here to celebrate a birthday and it was great. Had the tamales and the brisket taquitos- both were fabulous. The margaritas are amazing- had the blood orange with half salt, half sugar rim since I couldn't decide sweet or salty. The goat cheese guacamole is amazing. I'm a sucker for cheese- especially Gouda, but the tamale dumplings were unimpressive."}
{"text":"Stopped Last Wednesday night before Cavs game, got there shortly after they opened at 5 Had a great high top table by the bar  It was happy hour  All tacos half price.  Drink specials too.  I had a pomegranate margarita with chili-lime salt on rim, excellent drink!  My wife had the red sangria, also very good!  Shared a smoked trout guac with homemade chips just out of the fryer, wished we had leftovers to take home but couldn't stop eating the guac!  Shared an order of shrimp soft taco's, again excellent.  Very small quaint restaurant with excellent drinks, food and service!  Can't wait to go back  Server was very attentive and got us in and out in plenty of time to get downtown!  We highly recommend Momocho!"}
{"text":"The only reason this gets 4 and not 5 stars is for the wait and service, but I went on a Saturday night at 9 without a reservation so get a reservation early and it's probably a 5 star experience.    We walked up and were told it would be 30-35 mins but waited an hour to be sat, which was fine given no resy and I know how packed the place gets.  However, we were sat in the patio corner and our server was fairly slow to respond to us.  It probably took 30 mins before we could actually order our meal.  From there, the food was great and service was okay.  First, we got the chips and salsa sampler, which was excellent.  It comes with 3 different salsas, pineapple, green chili and traditional, none of which are very spicy (my personal preference), but are good nonetheless.    The entrees are a bit of a do-it-yourself thing, as the meat comes out on a plate with a couple of salsas and the tortillas come out separately.  You then roll up your own mini-taco with whatever meat you ordered.  I'm typically not a big fan of this set-up (my thinking is I'm paying, you do it!), but it works out quite well here.    I got the tinga, which is a safe play, spicy grilled chicken, with some salsa on the side.  The chicken was hot and tender and the salsas went well with it.  A friend got the mahi mahi with similar salsas which was also very good.    Smoked gouda and grilled corn on the cob were our sides and were very tasty as well.  The food has good flavor without just being spicy like some mexican restaurants.  I would echo the other comments here on yelp and say this is about as good as Mexican gets.  Highly recommended but get a reservation early, like a week or more in advance if you are going on a weekend."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, we went a while ago so I don't have to many vivid details.  I do remember the server had a lot of respect for the chef/owner (which says a lot) and was awesome.    The warning we got there was important too.  If you look up something on your phone, it will not be that similiar to what is on the menu.  We looked up two or three things and the server caught us and explained the differences between the \"traditional\" or google version and the one at Momocho.   So if you want to ask without giving away that you have no idea about mexican foods that aren't from Taco Bell, just say \"I have heard you make things different here, can you tell me about the ...\""}
{"text":"So the boyfriend really wanted to go here during our three day weekend in Cleveland, but it was like 2 hour wait. Then he went to the hotel and researched Momocho to find that it was on DDD and I know he got super excited because I know he's secretly a Guy Fieri fan even though he pretends to share my distaste for the show being on for at least 6 hours a day and like 12 hours on the weekend.  So the next day, he called to try to get reservations before they opened and they said they were all full and they opened at 5 even though Yelp said 4. Yelp doesn't lie! So I called back and they said 4 - ah! we beat the system and we got seated right away when we got there. Just go early!!  And so the boyfriend usually never listens to me about the amount of food that he wants to order. So we ordered the guacamole sampler with goat cheese, pineapple and smoked trout. GO SMOKED TROUT ALL THE WAY. Goat cheese was meh. The guacamole was super good though - it had chunks of avocado even though the DDD episode said they make it without chunks. Anyway, diverging from the point - it's good. And so, we were full without even finishing the guacamole. Someone needs to tell the bf that I'm always right.  I ordered the machacha taquito and he ordered carnitas taquito. I should learn from past experience that when I force him to order something other than what he wants that his dish is always better. The machacha was not bad, but wasn't my cup of tea and it was SUPER salty - I wanted to drown myself in water. So we switched plates since we liked each others better. I loved the carnitas - super delicious, but of course we didn't eat much since we were full. We left with a whole bag of leftovers and ate the rest for breakfast.  FYI - your burps will smell after eating here. :P"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The space is  quaint and cozy and perfect for a quick bite or drink. The three stars are only for the atmosphere and cucumber margarita. The food and service left a lot to be desired.  During my first visit on an uncrowded weekday night, the weight staff hastily took our drink order without asking our preference for sugar/salt (they offer various toppings for rims.) It was disappointing to receive a fight of margs clean rimmed. The food was mediocre at best. We started with guac (which was tasty) but the pineapple \"salsa\" tasted like chopped canned pineapple, and the chicken tamale had not only a human hair, but also unidentifiable chicken parts -- something I didn't realize until I warmed up leftovers the next day. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon; not for dinner anyway."}
{"text":"Man, oh man, do I love this place. All you have to do is combine goat cheese and guacamole for me to love you. Does that make me easy? Probably.   But really, this place lives up to its hype. I've been here twice, and both times have just been extraordinary. Their taquito entrees are delicious, and their sides are to die for. For the taquitos, I had the remolacha. A bunch of different flavors and textures that will amaze you. Regarding the sides, the smoked gouda tamales and the sofrito green beans will leave you wondering what you've been eating your entire life. It's like an explosion of flavor enticing your taste buds. Yes, my mouth is currently watering.  Be warned-if you get the guacamole trio, like we did, be prepared to take the rest of your meal home. It's more than we bargained for, but oh so delicious. The goat cheese guac, pineapple guac, and blue cheese guac are all excellent. I've also tried the jalapeno bread pudding for dessert. Simply amazing. You get the flavor of jalapeno without all that heat, and it just makes for a very unique dish.   If anything is the downfall, its the wait in general. Waits to get a table are long, but nothing going next door to Johnny Mango's for their super strong mojitos won't fix. We had a wait a bit for our server the second time, which was a bit of an annoyance. However, this place is worth it, trust me."}
{"text":"By far some of the best eclectic Mexican food! This place does not disappoint! The guacamole sampler, braised beef short rib tamales, pork chop, etc... Are a few dishes to try! Yum"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5. Trendy area of Ohio City - small and intimate two floor restaurant.  The kicker is the Mexican \"libre\" (wrestling) stuff they have all over the place, as well as the open grill right next to pretty much all the tables on the top floor.  Cost: 3. Momocho's firmly overpriced by Cleveland standards.  That said, they can get it away with it due to: small amount of tables, advertisement from food network appearance, strong customer service (all the waiters/waitresses know what they're recommending).  Food Quality: 4. Tequila/Margarita offerings get a five (pretty much anything I've ever heard of is one the menu, at least 20+ offerings between the major tequilas). Guacamole gets a five (best infused guacamole I've had hands down) - get a trio sampler, worth the price even with two people.  My recommendation is Crab - Pineapple - Blue Cheese.  Taquitos is where things get dicey. Momocho's good, but a lot of the offerings have too similar accompanying salsas and frankly not that exciting dishes.  Wasn't a fan of their apparently very popular carnitas taquitos, thought it was too sweet. Service: 5. Great service, wait staff always watches your drink situation (both booze and water) and they are helpful on recommendations even after going a few times of new things to try.  When to return: Special-but-not-too-special occasions, early dates, group dates, ~4 person group outings, happy hour after work at bar.  Make sure to make a reservation 2+ days in advance or get their extremely early, place is small so it's very hard to get a table."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Friday happy hour. Sat at the bar and ordered what was on special: half price traditional margaritas and taquitos. Average margaritas; good but not great. Mamacha taquitos were amazing: juicy beef brisket with guacamole and tomatillo sauce, served with corn tortillas. Great portion with fabulous flavor. This was my first visit but won't be my last."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Cleveland hands down. Margaritas are phenomenal. They have several types of guacamole, all of which are delicious. The atmosphere is great and the service is excellent as well. All of their food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow! My Daughter told me to hit this place, on our recent trip through from Buffalo. She was spot on! Everything was fantastic, from the ambiance, drink menu, our server , Damion, and of course the food. Started with fresh chips and a tomatillo verde salsa( one of six choices), also a cup of crab/ guacamole! My pork chop / mole specialty with corn meal / cheese dumplings, was prepared perfectly. Rosie had crusted trout w/ pepitas and pecans, along soffrito green beans. I shall go back to visit Cleveland soon, just to visit this unique establishment."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Saturday night around 9:30 and found a seat at the bar without a problem, which we were pretty psyched about since we'd heard the wait can be pretty intense.  I ordered a blood orange margarita and like some other reviewers, was sort of disappointed they were pre-mixed. That being said, our guacamole was awesome and the mahi mahi tacos were delicious! The bartenders were pretty friendly, too- can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Taquitos are not just the little frozen cylinders in the supermarket. Turns out they are like little tacos....so I learned something today. Tuna was fantastic, great flavor, would eat those daily. Also, the girlfriend couldn't stop \"mmm\"ing in pleasure while eating the goat cheese guacamole. Don't underestimate the hot sauce either, I warned you."}
{"text":"Smoked trout guac - yum!  Never thought I would like fish in guac but the smoking makes it work.  Adds a really interesting textural component.  Seared sea scallops - scallops were the downside of this dish.  They did not have  good sear, but the croquette and corn/pablano parts were delish and worked with the flavor of the scallops.  Albondigas - OK, flavors were not merried well and lacked umami (I hate using that word- stupid kikoman, but the dish lacked it).  Overall- great apps (guac!) and drinks- will go again b/c I think we ended up ordering the wrong things.  Would have given it a 4- but everything was a bit too salty and the scallops lacked a sear."}
{"text":"We love the \"flights\" of guac and margarita sampler. Been here a few times, and most of their fresh take on mexican food are winners. A few of their dishes have little flavor. They just need to expand their operation so it's closer! Highly recommend! Will be going back."}
{"text":"Went here with the family tonight, including the baby. The staff was super nice and attentive! No complaints.  The food was very good. I'm visiting from California which has amazing Mexican cuisine and I would say this place ranks right up there. We had the guacamole flight, some margarita flights and what felt like one of everything on the menu.   I say it lives up to the hype and is worth trying. I would definitely go back! I want another spicy mango margarita!"}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful food, excellent service, great drink choices and the Spicy Mango Margarita is a must!  Not ordering the salsa verde and/or Guacamole would be a mistake...it's a little tight on seating, but that is the case in many great eating establishments is older bldgs!  Easy highway access and parking was not a problem.  We'll be back for sure!  Kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I LOVE having food that makes you actually glad you spent the money. I am a recent grad, so i must admit, i can't afford to go out this nice every night, but the food here was worth saving up for. It was amazing. It was the most creative, yet overwhelming joyful food i have eaten in a long time..... AND ALL I HAD WAS AN STARTER! I have been back twice since and REALLY enjoyed all the things the menu has to offer.   The GUACAMOLE WAS WORTH LIVING FOR, worth DRIVING in front of a truck and saving it for. It was amazing. And these crazy ingredients that i would NEVER thing to add and use all mixed in.  It was hands down, the ABSOLUTELY BEST (i have eaten alot of Guac in my life) BEST GUACAMOLE i have EVER had in my life. I have tried and LOVED All of these Guacamole's: guacamole / traditional guacamole / goat cheese / tomato / chile poblano guacamole / garlic confit / bleu cheese / chile verde (Can be Heavy on the stomach so watch out- bleu cheese is thick- and tasty) guacamole / blue crab / corn / chile chipotle guacamole / smoked trout / bacon / chile poblano (Best of the Bunch)  Beautiful surroundings. I like the paint on the walls and the decorations. Everything makes you feel like you are in a place that is full of passion. They are VERY passionate about the food. Red and fierce.    The service is top notch too. Friendly and always making sure you are happy, but not in your face the entire meal.  We came and only ate the guac, and our server treated us exactly the same as the table next to us that had five drinks a person, guac and a full meal.  She was friendly and really helps make sure you know what the menu says.  The best part was: They are very very busy and looked completely full on the Friday night we went.  but we walked in just to see what it was like (a trial run) and we didn't have a reservation. The hostess reworked the books and we were seated in a matter of two mins. It was AMAZING customer Service. Absolutely AMAZING.   Its a wonderful place. Good food and Good people. That is hard to come by. I am SO glad its right in my neighborhood.  I have since been back to the place and found my FAVORITE DISH: taquitos served cazuela style / corn tortillas / chile poblano rajitas / salsa verde machaca / coffee + ancho braised beef brisket / guacamole tradicional  The flavor slowly fills your mouth and you can get enough of it, Its salty and cilantro and coffee (but not coffee in the drink sense, in the season sense.  It is so tasty that you can actually taste it whenever you think about it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food and service are incredible! Definitely will be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"oh my oh my! I loved this place. Word to the wise: come hungry! If you order the guac sampler (and why wouldn't you?!), it's three FULL size servings of guac. No other food needed for dinner, but of course, my tacos were fantastic. Also, let's not forget the red pepper margarita."}
{"text":"I have dreams about the guacamole. Get the sampler, you can't go wrong. I personally cannot vouch for the white chocolate one, but I would try it if given the opportunity. That's how much I trust this place!  Taquitos are always a win... my favorite is the duck (pato).  The drinks are all really interesting and delicious too. Love the carrot margarita.   The servers are friendly and knowledgeable but I cannot say the same for the hosts (or whoever answers the phone). I was calling a week ahead of time to make a reservation on a weekend and little did I know, Momocho is completely booked on weekends. The person on the phone was rude to me and totally unhelpful.  That's not going to stop me from going back again and again, but I probably won't try to make reservations on the weekend for a while..."}
{"text":"I've been to Momocho three times and have yet to be disappointed. You will definitely want to make a reservation, as I've seen lines snaking out around to the parking lot right before open. Eric Williams' crew pumps out some seriously dank guacs (goat cheese is my fav, but the pineapple is also delish), taquitos, and clever entrees. The surprisingly sneakily tasty (as my non veg-head kitchen bros were surprised) Hongo/Portobello taquitos reign for me, and the cream corn in the scallop entree is savory and silky. Viva Momocho!"}
{"text":"Everything was really good, but the fifth star is for how much fun we had. My friend and I were really well taken care of by the super sweet bartender/manager who is sadly leaving!  For drinks, we did the margarita sampler-- cucumber, spicy mango, and red bell pepper. They were all great but the bell pepper was so fresh, surprising and different. Def a must try. We started off with those and the goat cheese guacamole which is as delicious as it sounds and served with fresh tortilla chips. After that, we had the butternut squash and goat cheese empanadas which had a really great texture and were served with actually the best mole I've ever had. The flavor was perfect. We also got the brisket taquitos. We both really enjoyed them.   I heard Cleveland was a foodie town so I couldn't have picked a better spot for my first visit. Fun atmosphere, great food and service."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant by my house. Down to the service, food, atmosphere and drinks. Their tostadas and margarita flight are a must have."}
{"text":"Great place! Me and my partner in crime, after reading some of the reviews, decided to come here before a concert. We took advice from people and made sure to make reservations. (Very good idea. About 10 minutes after we got there, there was a wait.) Even though the place was small, I still believe the diners were able to obtain privacy, and not be elbow to elbow like in other places its size. (A true plus!)   As for the food? The  smoked trout and bacon guacamole is a must try. And I love the pork belly taquitos! The price for everything was great too! We went during happy hour and got half off our taquitos. The whole thing, guac, two taquitos, and two non alcoholic drinks, all came around to $30. Wow! If you're going to go, go during happy hour and you get a great deal!   The service was great also. I think our server's name was Ryan, and he did a great job. We never wanted anything and he was very polite even though the dining room looked rather busy.   As for the atmosphere, my companion, who's actually been to mexico, said that it reminded him of an actual Mexican cantina. Very dark, quaint, the use of candles... It was actually quite romantic! My only complaints would be that maybe it was a little too dark. And there was limited parking. (Very small lot...) But if you go early, it shouldn't be a problem. That being said, I would feel like making an issue of those things would be rather nit-picky, but they are good to keep in mind for your first visit."}
{"text":"God-level food and drink prepared with a thunderous level of passion and complete absence of pretentiousness. I really want to delete anyone's account that has cost chef Eric Williams a 5-star rating. Honestly he should be the first 6-star Yelp chef/owner.   Actually I really just want to delete Yelp altogether. The entire network.  But I am a humble internet god and I believe in the power of choice for men and women to holler until their lungs are raw into this crimson echo chamber that costs small businesses millions of dollars a year. Anyways, that's why I had to show up here and save this entire platform for the culture. I am alpha and omega and Pants.  Get your pee tested if you're not starting off with the guacamole holy trinity."}
{"text":"Cucumber margarita.  Amazing.  Sat at the chef's table.  Loved the food.  Loved the place.  Loved the margaritas.  Would have preferred not to see how they make the bacon trout guacamole."}
{"text":"With a hip ambiance, and a deep tequila list, you'll find a great selection of mexican-american cuisine for the palate.    Colours are deep, and the walls adorned with Mexicano memorabilia including Lucha Libre personalities and the like.  Food quality is good, with spices that can excite.  I am a little sad that fresh Habenero isn't readily available, though they will give habenero sauce if they are asked.  The guacamole is a meal unto itself, so order with some modicum of caution.  Overall a good addition to the restaurants in Cleveland.  Great for a drink or a tapas style meal.  Is it mexican?  Well..."}
{"text":"Best contemporary Latin food in Cleveland! The House Margeritas is awesome, cucumber with some heat on the edges. The Chile Relleno is delicious, the sauce is perfect...Get 2!!!  The Guacamole is all kinds of AWESOME. I love the blue cheese version. We have tried several times to replicate but as much as I hate to admit it, they make it better than I do.  Why only 4 stars? Because I can NOT stand that I had to wait 45 minutes one time for my reservation one time with not even a sorry or complimentary drink. The next time I was stuck in traffic and 20 minutes late and they cancelled my reservation. End result? I rarely feel inclined to drive there and take the risk of long lines...  That said, the food is good. If you live on the West side live it up..."}
{"text":"Food is to die for! I love the atmosphere as well. Also love the margarita options. The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent. Perfect place to go for a date night too!"}
{"text":"pretentious atmosphere complete with over-priced mexican food.  If you are dining with a party of 5 or more, better break out the calculator, because the wait staff will refuse to do ANY math of any kind as far as splitting the bill is concerned.  Regardless of bill splitting \"rules\" I\"ve never had a waiter refuse to accomodate guests."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambience.  Dim and cozy with walls covered in candles and Mexican kitsch.  Knowledgeable and unpretentious staff, complete with plaid shirts and hipster beards. A fun place to stumble into on a dark winter's eve for a margarita and braised boar tacos.   The small, street-style corn tortillas that are served with the taco meat are much-appreciated.  I am discovering that funky Cleveland has many gems, and this is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Order the tacos! Or tacquitas during happy hour. The trick to Momocho is knowing the right thing to order. We've tried their other food selections, such as enchiladas, but it could not even compare to their tacos. I am giving it a 4 star mostly for their tacos and guac! They have a great selection of guacamole - one of them was even featured on Food Network. As for their tacos/tacquitas, be adventures, and try something you wouldn't normally get. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My college roommate lives in Cleveland, so I try to get out there every ~18 months.  While his wife was not in the mood for Mexican, they like Momocho so much that she capitulated.  They were spot on.  Service was on point and the food was delicious.  Standouts were the smoked gouda tamale balls (legit heaven...and $3.50???) and the brisket taquitos.  Oh.  And a fig (?!) margarita? Ridic.    Momocho is known for its guac, and that was the part I thought missed the mark a bit (fresh, but a bit gummy...and could have used more salt).  But what a meal..."}
{"text":"Loved the goat cheese guacamole. The cucumber margarita was amazing. Guava was a little on the sweet side. And two margaritas in, the rest of my review is kind of suspect...they don't skimp on the tequila, but you sure don't taste it.   I had the pork chop with mole. Not a traditional mole, but a hell of an interpretation. Chocolatey spicy deliciousness.   The kitschy interior is fun and inviting. Our service was top notch too. I was fairly skipping out of there."}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday night.  I was able to get the chef's table as a surprise for my husband.  Wow, wow, wow.  We had eaten at Lola the night before, so we weren't expecting this place to compete with that - were we surprised!!  First of all, the chef's table was awesome, only two seats, RIGHT by the chef, Tom, who was very friendly and gave us several little \"extras\" through out the evening.  We had Margarita samplers (his fave was the pineapple, mine was the red bell pepper), and the guacamole sampler (we ordered the smoked trout, the crab, and the goat cheese - all were great - and Tom gave us some of the gouda/roasted garlic/agave nectar, which blew all three of them away).  Mike had the wild boar taquitas, and I had the short rib tamales.  Everything was incredible, the price was not bad at all, and the atmosphere was super casual.  Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Momocho has one of the best happy hours around!  But you have to get there early.  The happy hour is only available on the first floor and the place fills up quickly.  I've been there a number of times and we've always liked out food.  I've also tried the margarita flights (three drinks of various varieties) and it's a great way to try some of their unique drinks.  Plus the food is delicious.  Free on street parking and a small parking lot next door is very helpful."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is a little small. The food is fantastic and so are the drinks. Eat here!! It's so damn good my mouth is watering while writing this."}
{"text":"While recently visiting Cleveland and looking for a good place to enjoy a nice meal on a Saturday night with an old friend, she suggested we check out what is apparently the hottest new spot in town. I was of course intrigued when she mentioned that they had Mexican food - as I am a huge fan of anywhere where there are margaritas and chips and salsa.   We called earlier in the day in hopes of getting a reservation, but were told they were booked and we'd have better luck simply arriving and waiting for a table. When I got there around 7:45 I was told the wait would be about an hour for a table for three, so we promptly posted up at the bar and got ourselves a cucumber and spicy mango margarita - both of which could not have been more different or more phenomenal. The cucumber marg was cool and refreshing, a delicious summer beverage and the mango was spicy - seriously so - and delicious - the perfect pair with their guac and chips.   We were seated in a little under 45 minutes from the time we walked in, which wasn't bad and went fast while seated at the bar, enjoying the first drinks. Immediately when we sat down we began perusing and knew we wanted some queso and guac. It took a few minutes before a server appeared and when he did we promptly ordered some cucumber guac and some chorizo queso. The queso and guac were unusual - the queso in an amazing way - it wasn't so cheesy and contained a very generous portion of sausage and onions and was served with tacos. The guac however wasn't really my jam - I didn't love the cucumbers in there and found myself eating around them.   We got the gouda dumplings which were unlike anything else I've ever tasted and were amazing. We also tried the shrimp taquitos which came in a sauce that was literally unreal - seriously I was dipping my chips in it and would have eaten it with a spoon. We also go the brisket tamales which were good, but a little sweet for the mood I was in that night and not enough relleno sauce in my book. We also got a side of beans and rice and I rarely say this, but the rice was heavenly with some lime on it - seriously the best white sticky rice I've ever had.   The prices for the quality and portions were great - for two apps, two drinks, three side dishes and two mains we paid $90 and took home two large to go boxes because we just couldn't finish everything. This place is 4.5 stars, just can't give it the full 5 because the service was a little slow and I didn't dig the cucumber guac."}
{"text":"I am not normally a fan of guacamole, but Momocho's sampler choices are so good (5 stars for that item) that I will come here any time for it. Very good food overall."}
{"text":"Momocho is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland! I have been numerous times - you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This mod-mex restaurant is one block away from home and was recently featured in the food channel.   I have eaten there three times since moving from Atlanta and have always been really impressed with the food, drink, service, and of course, the atmosphere.   Going inside, you'll notice a modern dark yet rustic design filled with lucha libre wrestling pictures, masks, and wall art.  In fact, they have one wall that is just cool to look at--thick framed wrestler pictures interspersed among old crosses and candles.   Back to the food...wait...back to the crowd.   Ever since they were featured, it's been hard to get in--so people have been arriving earlier than usual say 5 to eat dinner!   That's a bit too early for me.   But, alas, we went at 5 last night and grabbed a cucumber margarita to start--yes, what a nice way to start the weekend!   It was fleshy, yet clean tasting and got me ready!   We started with the garlic blue cheese guacamole doused with their home made (I think) hot sauce which comes in apothecary bottles--the stuff is addicting.  For dinner, we got the langostina and hanger steak taquitoes and  tamale dumplings (wow). The langostina taquito was nicely smothered in a wine butter broth and it just made you feel nice--even nicer with the tamale dumplings (soft cheesy hot pillows).   The steak taquitoes were really good as well--with a couple of dipping sauces--go for the red one but start with the green!   Previously, I ordered the Kobe albondigas (meatballs)--and I would say, that even though the steak taquitoes were superb, I really really wish to eat the Kobe meatballs again.   So, after dinner, we walked home, full of food and drink, and started the weekend off by popping a couple more bottles of wine...Go go go but it;ll be a wait to get in."}
{"text":"First, they made our party sit at two tables....the dining room was less than half occupied.  Chips and different salsa and guacamole were very good. We tried several different tacos, as well as a chilli relleno..  All were very good and unique.  So food was good, but issues with splitting bills, not accommodating our group etc... was disappointing.  They need to understand that they are in the customer service business. Too many rules, not quite right."}
{"text":"Guacamole, salsa, and margarita flights - it's my Mexican dream come true! Small restaurant but great service. Beware that 20% gratuity is applied to tables of 6 automatically, we didn't mind because our service was great, but something to note. Fun, low lighted, quirky vibe. Got the pescado taquitos and was not disappointed, stole some Brussels sprouts and they were addictive. Hibiscus margarita is super sweet, cucumber one was perfectly balance, spicy mango is really good as well. Has crab, pecorino and goat cheese guacamole - would recommend all of them."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and my friends wanted to come to this place. They had been before and were raving about how wonderful it was.  So the restaurant itself is cool. I like that it is an old house and that the neighborhood is pretty residential. It is unique. The inside is eclectic with lots of random artwork. All the random things on the wall like the half naked people made for conversation starters and things to joke about at dinner.  I was impressed when I called ahead to make a reservation. The host/hostesses were very friendly and were able to fit our party in when there was limited space.  The reason for the 3 stars is the food. That is pretty much why I come to a restaurant so that is the reason for a 3 star rating. To me, the food was overrated. The food was good, but not great.  Nothing stood out to me. For the price point, I expected to be wowed. I feel like I cook similar food at home. I agree with other reviewers that this is not Mexican food. However, I knew this going in. I had watched a you tube video about the restaurant and the food is the owner's interpretation of Mexican food. To me authentic Mexican food is when the menu is written on the wall and you have to point because no one speaks English. This was more of a fresh twist on Mexican.  If I were to ever return, it would be for the happy hour which you can only do downstairs in the bar."}
{"text":"Yummy. Lots of different flavors and strong, tasty drinks, and nice service. Four thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to this restaurant for his birthday, and it was definitely worth it! It took us so long to order because we just didn't know what to get since everything just sound so flipping good! There were 5-6 different types of guacamoles (goat cheese, smoked trout, original, etc), and we narrowed it down to the smoked trout one, which amazingly also had chunks of bacon in it. HOLY MOLY, it was sooooooo delicious! The flavor was so rich, and the chips that came with it was perfect as well! For our entrees, we got the braised beef  (which has a hint of coffee. DELICIOUS!) and pork chops (the sauce was chocolate mole! SO GOOD!). I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great. Prices seem high, but the portion size is deceptively large. Between the two of us, we share the lamb and duck taquitos (both of which were excellent). We ate 12 taquitos total and wound up taking home about half of each order. The leftovers were enough for 6 more normal sized tacos. The cucumber margarita was unique and very tasty, and I appreciated the tequila selection and sangrita chaser. The only thing that didn't sit well with me was the price of chips and salsa, but if you're sharing among 4 people rather than 2 it's not so bad."}
{"text":"Went there for my best friends birthday...it was awesome!!! Ladies don't wear high heels in this place it's very dark and has narrow steps to go up and down stairs. On the note of it being dark it's hard to read the menu so read it at home before you go and know what you want so you can tell you server when you get seated because they are a very busy place and everything is made to order...so food takes some time. I had guacamole for the first time that I actually liked it was the goat cheese one yummy!!! Had the hanger steak it was beyond yummy. Another friend that was with us had something the was soaked in coffee and I will be going back to get that ASAP!!! If you want to eat here we called ahead by like a week or so...it's very popular.  Side note parking is a total \"B!£#\" good luck with finding a spot their parking holds like 10 cars :-("}
{"text":"An outstanding Mexican place! I was visiting a friend from Cleveland this past weekend, and she said this is one of her favorites and I have to agree!  I really enjoyed the margarita sampler; it was fun to be able to try a bunch of more \"out there\" flavors instead of committing to a full one of one.    We split the guacamole sampler, and let me just tell you -- goat cheese + guac is a game changer.  For my main, I ordered the machaca taquitos which were amazing.  The beef was so tender and the coffee roast / rub situation on it was unreal.  I loved that they include a blank postcard with your check! If you fill it out that day, they'll send it for you."}
{"text":"ATTENTION!! I had a revelatory dining moment for $30. Yes, the Guava, the Hibiscus, and Chile-Mango margarita trio was superb, and yes, the pineapple-habanero guacamole (with extra house-made habanero sauce on top) was remarkable, but hold your horses: crispy confit pig tails with jalepeno chimichurri and queso cojita?!?! It just ROCKED MY WORLD. Imagine braised pork belly and chicken wings having a love child. Fatty. Salty. Meaty. Spicy. And sucking it off the bone got me in touch with my inner caveman. My last forkfull of confit made my toes curl. I am purring."}
{"text":"Helpful little tip- make a reservation, YES, even on a random tuesday night. I called  in that afternoon and couldn't get a reservation till 830pm. So, do it. Momocho is a quaint little mexican place that has two stories- the lower one is the bar and 2nd floor is the dining room. The dining room looks like it seats maybe 40 people. A small cute dimly lit joint with a lucha libre theme. We started off with the guacamole with crab and pickled corn. It was amazing, but we could barely taste the crab. The nacho chips were also a little too salty. No worries, we devoured the entire thing. I got the lamb chops and my friend got the machaca. I loved my lamb. It was accompanied with a goat cheese sauce with guacamole and garlic kale. My friend's dish came with tortillas. His complaint was that the dish was also heavily salted. He barely ate any of his food that night.  His mango margarita however was heavenly and my meal was paired with a semi sweet white wine from Argentina ( its the one that has fresh grass and floral notes in its name. I suggest it!) For dessert we got their fried ice cream and their cinnamon empanadas. We loved both of them! Fried ice cream is only 5$ but dont be fooled by the price- its equivalent to like 4 scoops.! Our server Nicole was great and checked up on us regularly.  They have one unisex bathroom downstairs i believe. A great place to catch up with people after work or for a first date! A great twist on modern tex mex and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"amazing guac! amazing queso dips. not a bad place for happy hour. also visited for the pop up ramen night. wasnt a fan of the ramen. more chinese taste than japanese taste. not that authentic ramen i was looking for"}
{"text":"OVerpriced. The guacamole was ok. We got the crab. Sat upstairs and it was very dark but other than than pretty good ambiance. I got the lambchops and they were alright. An awful lot of bone and fat on them and not really a lot of flavor. I also tried the boar tacos and they were just ok too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are amazing! Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. You can tell that the food is made with fresh, quality ingredients. It's well worth it. They're cocktails are also fantastic! Just make sure you call ahead to make a reservation because they tend to get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Being from southern California, I was really critical of this place. However, we loved Momocho.  We had 3 kids with us and they accommodated us by giving us a nice large table upstairs. The food was unique, yet had the traditional Mexican flavors. If you love guacamole, you need to try the samples.  I also had their beef tongue which was tender and flavorful.   You have to love the Luchador theme of the place. We met the owner and he was really cool. He talked to my whole family outside and even took a picture with us. Any guy who has never been to Mexico and open up a Mexican restaurant and pull it off deserves to be praised! ¡Muy Bien!"}
{"text":"we were visiting Cleveland to see a show at the theater. I hadn't been in Cleveland for years and I have to admit that I did not have a good impression of the city but dear God Momocho is awesome. we tried margarita flights (blood orange was my favorite and my wife loved the pineapple), guacamole, brisket tacos, black beans and the lamb. everything was well done and I don't think we left a crumb on the plate. the margaritas were small sized but they had quite a bit of kick to them. this place certainly lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Great quaint Mexican restaurant in a nice location.  They have a small parking lot next to the restaurant for parking which is great since it's on a tight street. You can't go wrong with the coffee braised beef!"}
{"text":"Service is superb!  Everyone seemed super happy to have us there.  The ambiance was perfect - loud but not too loud.  The decor was really cool as they had random bikes up on the walls/ledges.  Then the food - OMG - the food was soooooo delicious!  We had the Guacamole flight - who knew such a thing existed!?  Not me!  We shared the scallops with the creamed corn sauce - absolutely incredible.  We also had the Sofrito Green beans which were so good I didn't even use a fork! :-)  Straight up ate them with my fingers.  Finally - we washed the food down with another flight... this one was the margarita flight!  Who knew there was a margarita flight!!!!???? I slurped down a pineapple one, a blood orange one and my absolute favorite one was the cucumber one! WOW!!!  each glass had a different type of salt on the rim.  Seriously!?  Different type of salt?  If I lived in Cleveland - and not New York City - I would go back again and again... and again."}
{"text":"Super excited to try this spot.  It was a beautiful night in cleveland so we grabbed an outside seat right at 5 pm. Happy hour is from 5 to 630 but we found out it doesnt include outside. No biggie. We did get eaten alive by mosquitos as we sat in far back corner by some plants. This review would have been 5 star for food alone. Definitely a great restaurant and food quality was excellent.  Service unfortunately dropped the review 1 star. Maybe she was having a bad night but our gal (shall remain nameless) was just rude and trite. Simple question of taquitos being rolled or not like tacos got a rude response. Never offered to move our table when she heard us talk about mosquito bites. This is totally not the restaurants fault obviously  She wouldnt take our food order with the drink order.  We had to ask for dessert menu.  Lets talk about the food...excellent! Huilacoche guacamole, chorizo bondito, trout tostado. Braised short rib especiales, and for me the machaca taquitos that come with corn tortillas ao you can make tacos fyi! All scrumptious. Dessert was a delicious flan and the ginormous deep fried ice cream which was bigger than a tennis ball.  Great meal, will be back but we will sit inside and hope for a different server."}
{"text":"Momocho is one of those restaurants that does everything right. Atmosphere, simple menu, good drinks and great service.   The food is delicious and portion sizes are generous.  Great bold and spicy flavors. Fairly authentic ingredients but who cares when it just tastes good!  My favorites are the tamale dumplings with mole, chile relleno and any of the \"taquitos\".  Save room for dessert.  Flan, fried ice cream...mmmm"}
{"text":"Could have been better...service kinda lacked, it's too bad for such a notable establishment.   The food was too salty along with the staff.  I expect a friendlier service, but no.  This is not the first time I've been here, but it is the first time I've had terrible service.  Rude, and absolutely non personable.  I had a finger held up to me, almost like shushing...excuse me?  It was my mother's birthday and they don't even offer a complimentary dessert, interesting....not really expecting a free ride, but if you have costumers that are loyal I would imagine you would take care of them on occasion.  Tell your staff to loosen up, it's not that serious."}
{"text":"Momocho is still wonderful.   Stopped in the other night to use a gift card given to me by one of my fave Yelpers, \"the China dude\".   The pork belly taquitos were scrumptious! I died and went to pig heaven. That stuff seriously melted in my tubby mouth.   As always: great service, friendly bartenders, delicious grub, absolutely lovely atmosphere.   Thanks to the regulars who bought us a shot and to the adorable fashionista Genna who was the hostess that night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Ohio city. Such an unique place to get modern Mexican food. The guacamole list is amazing with spicy and creative toppings. Such a upscale vibe with tequila and beer. I love all the creative art and painting all over the walls. The pork chops and mole sauce blew my mind and I couldn't stop eating it. The staff was friendly and helpful with the menu and took time to explain everything to me and my grandma. $-$$"}
{"text":"Delicious. Their water tastes like chemies, but you won't notice it if you're drinking margaritas. Try the cucumber margarita or the mango habanero if you're feeling frisky. Rabbit empanadas with mole are the bomb."}
{"text":"Now I know my way around a taco (if ya know what I mean;) but this bisnatch got dem dopest Mexican food around it ain't no thang! Gone be thinking bout that guac while making love tonight bro"}
{"text":"My wife and I have always been Mexican food fans.  Hell, we even had Mexican food at our wedding cause we love it so much. So with that in mind, we LOVE this place. I'm a big guacamole fan, so when I saw that they served sampler platters I was all in.    Guacamole + Goat Cheese = 5/5 stars. Holy crap, I'm still craving it and I'm stuffed.   Guacamole + Trout = 4/5 stars. If you love fish then this is for you. Otherwise stay away from this, it's a bit fishy tasting but personally I loved it.   Guacamole + Crab = 3/5 stars. Great guacamole but you couldn't really taste the crab. Barely any in the mix. Bummer.   As for entrees I had the duck tacos and wow was that good. Fantastic sauce as well. Oh and did I mention Margarita samplers? Yep, it was a great night."}
{"text":"Mochomo Mod Mex is a hip, fun restaurant, reasonably priced and offering truly great, authentic Mexican food. We went on the recommendation of all the on line reviews, and were happy we tried it. Most of the entree part of the menu is taken up by a listing of \"Taquitos\", which are cazuelas of various types of meats served with corn tortillas to make your own tacos. I tried the chancho, which was shredded wild boar with a mustard cream sauce, and my husband had the pato, which is duck with a pomegranate sauce.  All of the taquitos come with different sauces to spoon on top of them, and both of ours came with a delicious house made pickled jalapeno relish. These are substantial meals, but you can order a side of beans and/or rice for a nominal fee. There are more entrees on the menu, and we'll go back to try them all. They offer a nice list of appetizers, and they make 5 or 6 different types of guacamole..we had the traditional, and it was good, although I've had guac all over Mexico, and the American versions always use more garlic than they would south of the border. The tequila list is more than adequate, although not hugely impressive. A wonderful bonus...eat in the bar betweeen 5 and 6:30 Tuesday thru Friday for happy hour and the \"taquito\" items on the menu are half price, as is the traditional margarita. We got out of there for $30 with tax and tip, although we didn't order any drinks. Two thumbs up for Mochomo!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  great tequila selection, great guacamole - pistachio bacon chocolate is the best!"}
{"text":"Everything to me was average was just ok. We had the guacamole sampler nothing special most at our table of 7 thought bland. The Salsa sampler ok mix all three together and taste real good.  We had four different plates and no one was WOW was just ok.  The décor is very nice for area and food they are serving. All the food came out at different times 5 minutes apart ."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The prices were relatively high for the quality and quantity of the food. You pay for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great place to eat excellent Mexican food.  The menu is unique, the decor is cool and the location is actually convenient.  Service was relatively prompt, though with a minor hiccup as there was a change in servers midway through our meal.  We started with the guacamole sampler which was excellent.  We had the traditional, goat cheese and pineapple varieties.  All were great and everyone in my party agreed.  Our only criticism would be that the guac lacked some salt.  Along with the guac we had salsa, which we unfortunately had to pay $2 for.  Though, it was worth it as the salsa tasted great.  Packed a mild punch with the habanero pepper being subtle, yet appropriately portioned.    For the main meal I had the chongo taquito which was basically grilled peppers and portobello mushroom strips served with a cream sauce and fresh corn tortiallas.  The taquitos tasted great, especially with the cream sauce.   So why am I giving this place 4 stars instead of 5?  First, I feel like you shouldn't have to pay for salsa, no matter how great it is.  Second, I felt that the portion size was okay, but I would have preferred more food, especially given the price.  Despite these constructive critiques, this restaurant is excellent and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Words barely serve to do this experience justice. I say experience because I didn't just dine here at Momocho, I experienced Momocho.  Normally at a restaurant, I'm hesitant to try what others recommend. I want to have my own tastes develop and decide for myself what makes something great. Here, I couldn't help it, based on what others had said was good -- everything!  We started as you ought to, with the Guacamole sampler and ice cold beers. The traditional was amazing, the blue cheese and garlic confit divine. The goat cheese lacked a certain panache, but, it was not for lack of trying. We nearly made the mistake of filling ourselves full with just the guacamole, though we calmed ourselves down, our voracious appetites begging us for just one more bite after one more bite. We sampled a margarita flight, and fell in love with each flavor. The tequila was amazingly smooth and complimented our traditional, pineapple and mango margaritas.  And then, it was time for our entrees, and not a moment too soon. My wife ordered the machaca, and it was amazing. The beef was cooked just to the point where the collagen broke down, and created it's own sauce with the coffee and ancho, the peppers and onions. Our dining partners had the pato (roasted duck) and the bistec, each one as good as the last. I ordered the carnitas and sat amazed as hundreds of flavors danced across my palate. The green sauce was exquisitely vegetal and earthy, and the brown hot sauce amazingly hot and sweet at the same time.   The crown jewel of the evening was just around the corner, and I was ready for it as I looked my server in the eye and ordered the cucumber margarita.  I was hesitant to drink a fruit I hate. I don't like cukes, and I doubt I ever will. But, this? This drink made simply of tequila and cucumber juice sang to me as I sipped it carefully. The first sip was as though I'd died and gone to heaven. I almost trembled and fell to my knees to praise El Santo, who hovered above us, just by the kitchen. I felt like crying out in a Harry Met Sally-esque embarassment, screaming 'YES!' over and over. And those who'd tasted this brilliance in an eight ounce glass would likely have forgiven my intrusion on their meals.  I will admit that I couldn't make it to the fried ice cream, though I watched as my wife and our guests tore it apart voraciously. I wanted to try, but, I just didn't have the strength.  The experience was wonderful. Our server -- Eric B. -- helped our first time to be something we weren't expecting, which is an experience that while clueless, never felt as though we knew nothing. He took a few moments to describe the menu, and nodded with vigor at each choice, making each of us feel like we'd ordered the best thing off the menu. We sat just in front of the kitchen and watched as this busy restaurant placed order after order, the chefs never too busy, never too rushed, knowing that good food takes time and people would wait.  I want to go again. Tomorrow. And everyday after that."}
{"text":"Overpriced, We used to go here few times a month maybe 3-4 the service and quality started to go down a little or be hit or miss. honestly I think they think they are better than they are. hype is hype. so bottom line is you may enjoy it or you may not. seating is totally fucked up and the way they make it so if you sit upstairs there is no happy hour. really because you have inadequate seating or whatever reason we pay more...lol  I am done with this place and do not plan on going back. stop thinking your so special because you are not you are only  ave. at best"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Pig tails were amazing."}
{"text":"I would recommend the guacamole sampler, fun to share and who knew guacamole could have such a variety of flavor?  Loved the pineapple."}
{"text":"The Cucumber margarita was done very well, very light and refreshing.  The smoked trout and bacon guac was exceptional and well worth the trip.  The brisket taquitos were so - so.  I found the meat and tortilla shells to be a tad on the cold side.  While the flavor was alright, it was nothing out of this world.  Overall, I would go again for the drinks and guac.  The main courses left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Way overrated, at least for happy hour!  Regular margaritas:   SWEET.   WAY TOO SWEET.  Tasted like cheap Margarita mix.   Yuck.   Sending them back probably wouldn't have helped as they came premixed out of a plastic milk jug.     \"wild boar\" taquitos.   Meh.   A little pile of rather tasteless carnitas meat.   $15+.   Really?   Pretty much any Californian divey taqueria does as good or better job at half the price.    Smoked trout guacamole:  This was good, and an interesting flavor combination, but making guacamole is hardly rocket science!    By chance we met the owner, and his cocksure attitude and bravado were NOT reflected in the lackluster drinks and appetizers.    Maybe this place is so popular due to the dearth of good Mexican in Cleveland.   But there's plenty of other good Ohio City bars and restaurants, we'd never go back here."}
{"text":"Save your money and skip this place altogether. The entrees are pretty bad while still being expensive. I didn't care for the spicy mango margarita that has been highly recommended in certain reviews. Blood orange margarita was better but still not anything that I'm going to crave/want to return for.   The guac sampler was fine but overpriced ($20) for what it is, only worth getting in a big crowd. There were three of us and we were unable to finish it. Also, they charge extra for chips....seriously, the entire experience felt like a highway robbery.   The chicken entree (tinga taquito) was burned to a point of inedible - so if you're going to opt for it, make sure you tell them you'd like to be able to actually taste the meat. The pescado taquito, though not burnt, was a rather small portion and more importantly - tasteless. The fried ice cream is terrible, and let's be honest, fried ice cream is kind of hard to mess up.   Sigh, Yelp really let me down with this recommendation. The place was packed - I have no idea what people see in this place, though I guess if you're drunk enough, anything can taste good! I can only see myself returning for happy hour....if that."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun place to grab drinks with friends, this. is. it. Such a cute little place in Ohio City with great margaritas! I came here with a friend for dinner and drinks a few months back and now it's one of my regular spots.  They have a wonderful happy hour, which I highly recommend getting to early as their restaurant is on the smaller side. I love ordering their margarita flights because they have so many different fun flavors, it's so hard to make up your mind! I absolutely love the cucumber or pomegranate margarita. Tooooo good. I also recommend the guacamole samplers. They have so many different types of guac that you just can't go wrong! Their corn on the cob is also a must!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top 5 favorite places to eat in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and this place was amazing. I have had superb bartender's while being there. The one that stood out the most was Athena. She is attentive, insightful and provides impeccable service. She provided a ton of information on the food Momocho's serves as well as information about the city.   Thanks for the amazing experience and I look forward to stopping in one more time before I head out"}
{"text":"We  found this on DDD  website looked at reviews on yelp and menu and  we were a little leary because the menu , everything seemed strange especially the different guacs! First let me say the waiters are so informative and with a menu like this that is a must! We had the guac with corn and crab and 2nd visit guac goat cheese and tomato both absolutely the best and so much for 2. Our first visit Tom the waiter said don't get the guac sampler if you want to eat other food and he was so right, both so good we really wanted to try the one witn trout and bacon.  We had taquitos chicken, shrimp, roasted pork and bistec during our 2 visits all were excellent and so easy to share which is so fun cause you get to try so much. We came in from Florida and only had 5 days it was so good the first time we decided to go back to try new dihes because when on vacation it is so hard to find good places to eat that aren't chain restaurant. Both visits the waiters and all the staff were so friendly. I would advise make a reserVation and definetly go happy hour 5-630 except not on Sunday. But if you have to pay full price is still worth it. Happy hour the taquitos are half off.Wish we lived here this would be our date nignt place! The little neighborhood is cute and the atmosphere is very nice it is in an old house!"}
{"text":"We just finished a two week road trip through parts of the USA. We visited Momocho on one of the stops and it was one of our favourites of the whole trip. My wife was still raving about the Tinga (chicken Taquitos) weeks later."}
{"text":"A BIG Disappointment in the menu, I had to walk out! Please don't eat at restaurants that serve Rabbit meat. Empanadas and enchiladas are fine with any other meat! Rabbits are household pets and should be spared from restaurant menus."}
{"text":"The goat cheese guacamole and wild boar tacos were AMAZING.  I wasn't expecting to get great (let alone good) Mexican in Cleveland, but Momocho easily proved me wrong.  Even though I ate by myself, the vibe was perfect and my waiter went the extra mile to ensure I was enjoying myself as much as possible.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Not a bad thing to say, excellent service, excellent atmosphere, excellent food, excellent tequila.  I wish I could live here!  The beef taquitos are amazing, the guacamole with goat cheese blew my mind.  I can not wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best guacamole in Ohio. This place continues to exceed expectations every time I come here. Get there before they open at 5 if you don't have a reservation. They fill up in minutes."}
{"text":"I can't review this place.  They were closed for their holiday, which I later found out was on the website, but not very prominently displayed.  we braved the storm to go while we were there for two days.  So sad we weren't able to try it. The menu looks amazing"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices. Love the tingas"}
{"text":"I'm kind of bumming writing this. I had been here a handful of times, but its been over a year ago. We had always had an excellent dinner. I just made it back recently for a date night and was pretty disappointed. After having to make a reservation several weekends out only to get a table at 5:30, our highly awaited dinner was a bit of a bust. Service was decent and apps were yummy, but both of our dinners were BURNT-officially. My scallops also weren't cleaned well so I was crunching sand. I have to say that I will not be waiting weeks to get in here again, rather I will just be going somewhere else. Sad Momocho. I am sad."}
{"text":"Cucumber margaritas and guacamole are remarkable I almost always get the machaca and am never disappointed The scallops entree is delicious, I literally could eat an entire plate of the poblano creamed corn it comes with  Service is always attentive Happy hour is always jammed so you pretty much have to be waiting at the door when they open to get a seat at the bar but the deals are worth it"}
{"text":"While the food is good, I'm not a huge Mexican food fan. The guac is fresh and delicious and that is usually as far as I get food wise.  BUT THE MARGARITAS?! They are out of this world even if sometimes the are a little too sweet. They are always delicious though. I have gone for happy hour with a lot of different people and they've all loved them. I get the sampler every time because I can never choose just one.   Overall the place has a great vibe and there are always great/interesting people there and the owner is a super nice guy. I love this place."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, baby.....This is quite possibly the most amazing Latin food I've ever had, it's up there with Rick Bayless's restaurants in Chicago. Their different types of guacamole, their tamales...just off the hook, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Just a tip, try to get a seat at the bar, you get better and friendlier service there and the drinks have a stronger pour. If you sit at a table you're rolling the dice a bit. I did have a couple of occasions with table service being disappointing and at times downright rude and snooty. But I've never gone wrong sitting at the bar, the bartenders are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Margaritas are really yummy and they have some great flavors.   It can be pretty pricey, so happy hour is a great deal- bar area fills up fast though!"}
{"text":"Great selection of margarita's, especially cucumber with chili salt, cactus flower and mango - to sweeten things up. Haven't tried a bad flavor yet.. Guacamole and salsa sampler's are good choices. The goat cheese guacamole is a personal fav. Pork chop is my all time favorite dinner choice. Although sea scallops, and tuna are close seconds.  Service and bartenders are really nice.   Mexican wresting motif and dark ambiance are great."}
{"text":"Had been looking forward to going here for quite some time. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived at 8:20. Reservation was at 8:30. The interior is very very cramped. I thought the artwork would be more prevalent. Instead, I felt like I was in someone's old bedroom upstairs. However, the food is amazing! Very unique flavors. It's hard to find quality and unique Mexican food like this. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! Layers of flavor - high quality! Loved every bite of food and drink!!! Highly recommend! I got the mahi mahi and it was incredible!!!! Started with the guacamole with goat cheese (a must).  Now we also ordered the grill corned and tamale dumplings- both were a delight! I will now become a regular at this place! Very clean and service was perfect! Even when we walked in - great friendly staff working the door! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Redeemed. Went back had great service. Always great food. A neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"Went to Momocho lastnight for dinner. Would go again for the spicy mango margarita and the quac, but you would think that you would get unlimited baskets of chips when you spend $30 on quacamole. The taquitos weren't worth the price, my mahi was over cooked and we had to pay extra for a basket of chips ( which is the cheapest item to make and worth it to please your customers)."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Did I mention the food here is amazing? First, the margaritas are excellent. Then we had some killer guacamole. And for our main course my wife and I shared some fundido and the most amazing carnitas I've ever had. Can't wait to get back to Momocho."}
{"text":"Momocho is super cute and I love the space. That being said, it isn't the roomiest, so going during a busy time is not ideal. I had high hopes, as I have heard people speaking of Momocho as if it were the holy grail of Mexican cuisine.  I was not a HUGE fan of the food, if I ever go back I would get the guacamole and have that as my meal. I ordered the tamales and nothing seemed very flavorful to me. I prefer your run of the mill Mexican joint with your traditional menu and dishes, but that's just me."}
{"text":"went here for my birthday but didn't know it didn't open until 530. Should probably look into changing ours to accommodate for lunch. Anyway, we were seated promptly and ordered the guacamole sampler. It was awesome! The goat cheese went great with the sweet and smooth texture of the avacados. Overall a great place to eat and relax. Decor and atmosphere were both appropriate for he setting and visually stimulating. Will be returning as soon as we are able!"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! This place puts their own spin on traditional guacamole with several unique concoctions. The service was great too. Try the jicama and pineapple guac as a starter. I would also recommend the machaca as your main dish."}
{"text":"My sister and I went her one day and we stayed for a few hours just drinking and eating, and enjoying the company!  Very good mexican food, not traditional boring greasy, cheesey, regular mexican food,  the have smaller plates and big margaritas.    The service was great! I love it here and will be back!!"}
{"text":"well, once I learned that the owner of Happy Dog (so far my go-to place for casual weekend dining) also owned this place, I had to go and try it out!  After getting my baller haircut at Paul Mitchell's, I had several options to choose from for dinner in the area.  Should I go back to Le Petit and have savory crepes or should I venture down for some tequila at Momocho's?  Can't really compare the two, and they are both good, but I was in the mood for something a little spicy last night...  Now, as a doctor, I am instantly impressed with any restaurant that has the ability to pull off skulls hanging on the wall as decor....along with massive crosses, it really sets the atmosphere of the place.  There's also a little spray-paint picture of Guy Fieri on the wall next to the bar stating that he ate there....lots of the patrons were pointing it out, and this place definitely deserves that kind of attention.  Sat at the bar since I was by myself and basically asked the bartender for rec's on the whole menu, and he didn't steer me wrong the whole night.  Started off with the cucumber margarita which was very refreshing, only had the one since I was driving, going to have to come back a few times to try all the other flavors on the menu!  Goat cheese guac followed by the chancho taquitos....the thing I love the most about eating everything that moves on the planet, is that I get great recommendations on unique things, I've only ever had wild boar once before and it was really yummy last night, and I even had enough to take home for breakfast this morning, do it up with some scrambled eggs, phenomenal.  Luckily, I made room for dessert, not sure how that happened, but I'm sure glad it did.  Bartender suggested the capirotada...uh, gingersnaps with jalapeno bread pudding, you're sure, right?  ok, bring it on out....oh. my. goodness.....thank you Momocho for sending me a bartender who was also a foodie!  Came out piping hot with crema and mint on top, the flavors set off each other so well, it was delish!  Sweet and spicy, hold and cool all in one bite, and the top of the dessert was caramelized just perfectly....  I'm glad my mom likes tequila and Mexican as much as I do, I hope she comes out to visit soon so we can go back and sample some more things and maybe do a Sunday night dinner, wish they had that deal for singles out there :o(  reason for the -1 star."}
{"text":"The service was AWESOME! The waiter was great, fun, attentive, fast, knowledgable, just awesome overall.  The food was average I thought. Good for Cleveland, but average in general.  We started off with the guacamole sampler, and chose the goat cheese, pineapple, and crab varieties. Unfortunately, we all thought they kinda tasted the same.....  I was definitely disappointed that none of them were even remotely spicy.  For dinner we all got the shrimp, carnitas and machaca taquito entrees.  Note, that these are not your usual taquitos, and are more like what you would think to be fajitas.  I thought the machaca was laughable.  I've had lots of machaca in my day, and this tasted like beef stew.... ughhhhhh.....  The carnitas were delicious!  Well seasoned, tender, and they paired well with the dipping sauces on the side.  The shrimpies were big and fresh tasting, but rather bland overall.  I'd come back, but probably only for happy hour (when all taquitos are 1/2 price)."}
{"text":"I think this place is too much hype and not enough flavor.  Just making something spicy does not make it good.   We went here after hearing about the place constantly on Cleveland news.  My mom and I ordered virgin margaritas which tasted like citrusy Hawaiian punch.  J got the margarita and my dad got a Dos Equis.  We then decided to get the salsa trio and the guac trio - smoked trout, crab and original and were told that we would have to wait cause they make the chips to order.  If that means getting some doritos from the beer store across the street, washing them and heating them in a toaster oven, I would believe that they are made to order.  However, when I hear \"made to order\", I assume you are baking or frying the chips fresh and they should be awesome.  These weren't.  The salsa trio had pico, salsa verde and pineapple-jicama.  The pineapple would have been the stand out, but I didn't like the mint.  I feel it threw the whole flavor combo.  The verde was good and the pico was just too much cilantro.  The plain guac was just that - plain.  I make better at my house.  The crab and corn was interesting, but had not enough corn nor crab.  I didn't taste the smoked trout, but I think that was the same - not enough trout.   For our dinners, my dad had the bistec taquitos which are basically steak fajitas everywhere else.  The steak was amazing - perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My mom and I both ordered the mahi mahi taquitos.  They were way too spicy without any flavor.  The tortillas were horrible - mealey and bland.  J ordered the scallops with cauliflower hominy and creamed corn.  The scallops were amazing - perfectly seared and fresh.  The corn was to me just spicy.  The cauliflower hominy was a vision - crunchy on the outside, gooey deliciousness inside.  At first we thought it might have crab in it, it was so awesome.    As we were celebrating, we ordered the chocolate mousse and the jalepeno bread pudding.  I thought both were amazing.  Like amazing.  The mousse was cinnamony and topped with just the right amount of whipping cream and nuts.  The bread pudding was divine - spicy enough to know that you were eating jalepenos, but sweet enough to balance.  It was amazing.  It also came with a sparkler which fell over and burned the wooden plate that it came out on.  Tip:  Don't put fire on wood.    All in all, I would say come for the desserts and leave happy.  Expect the hype and be disappointed."}
{"text":"Would highly HIGHLY recommend the guac with goats cheese... I could have eaten that all night. Our mains were equally as good. Great atmosphere and lovely service."}
{"text":"Great Guac and margaritas.  Get the sampler.  You will need a reservation for this place during peak hours."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants! Why it took me so long to stumble in is beyond me...  The rave reviews are well deserved. Momocho not only serves up adventurous, seriously tasty Mexican fusion, the space is hip and inviting without being overly pretentious. The tequila selection is mind blowing. Next time, I will definitely have to try a margarita.  Of course, like everyone else here apparently, I had the Goat Cheese Guac and the Machaca (coffee + ancho braised beef brisket). Both excellent. I really liked the warm house made tortilla chips.   Maybe it was the tequila, but the food seemed to come out super fast. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.   Oh, how I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I learned about this restaurant from Michael Ruhlman's website and since I was in the area on business I thought I would seek it out. The food was excellent and probably one of the few if not the only authentic Mexican restaurants in the area. My friends and I were seated promptly, the food took awhile to come out but good food is not made quickly and our meal was excellent all around. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area who is looking for authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"What the heck was this place doing on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives?!? This place is none of these.  The food here was outstanding.  Did a guacamole sampler; traditional, goat cheese and smoked trout.  All really tasty but also really filling!  They don't chintz on the servings.  Also ordered the grilled corn on the cob.  Delish.  I'm not a big drinker but I had the Blood Orange Margarita.  I need to find this drink back home.  Entrees were the pork chop and the shrimp.  Chop was tender and both were well seasoned.  By the time entrees were done, we were wishing we had skipped lunch yet in a moment of insanity, ordered dessert.  Fried ice cream not only rolled in corn flakes but peanuts as well.  It is the size of a baby's head!  I ordered the chocolate pudding,  Sounds simple but man, it was so good. Sadly we only had 2 nights in Cleveland and the other was reserved for Lola.  My husband even bought one of  their t-shirts to memorialize our wonderful evening.  Reservations strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome modern Mexican place, cool ambiance, nice artisan food and good cocktails !! Love it"}
{"text":"Food made with care for deep flavors, drinks made with a smile and a fantastic little patio make it so hard to get into Momocho that we've waited in line more than once for a patio seat. It was totally worth it!! We've spent the winter at their spot in Lakewood - El Carnicero (which has a totally different vibe but same incredible food) but will be back in line when the patio opens up in the Spring."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here without reservations. They will turn u away after u spent 20 mins parking in the cold."}
{"text":"Great food Mod. MEXICAN awesome service. Really cool decor Luchador. Drinks yumm strong."}
{"text":"So 3 stars....3 because I can't do 3 1/2. This is a good Mexican restaurant, great for Cleveland! I am from San Diego and have been all over Mexico and S. America so am very picky. The food here is good. The guacamole is great and the rice is very tasty. There pico de gallo is really good to but there is something missing. Wait for it....LARD!!! Hello!?!?! Why has no one figured this out yet??? Lard makes everything better. It's gold!! Its terrible for you and that's why it tastes so good. So this is why. Go to Momocho...eat, drink and be merry but it will not be the best ever. 3 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"Not bad Momocho! I love your multitude of margarita flavors and your impressive list of guacamoles. As a true California girl I'm more of a savory Mexican food kinda gal so I didn't LOVE the pescado, but hey that's just my taste. Considering how much everyone else loved the food though I'll give you the stars- I think you earned them. I would come back for a pitcher of your amazing guava margaritas or for some tequila shots served with orange & cinnamon, yum!!! Thanks for showing me the light Momocho, if I ever show my face in Cleveland again I'll drop by for a visit."}
{"text":"Momocho is simply modern, simply delish.  When a friend suggested I try the amazing Mexican restaurant, Momocho, I laughed.  Amazing Mexican food in Cleveland, Ohio, eh?  I'm from Texas; where there's always a taqueria within walking distance to wherever you are.  I KNOW good Mexican food.    Despite my preconceived judgement and ego, I'm still an adventurer and venture out is what I did.  I'm sure glad I did because Momocho is a place that's dark, hidden, raw, sexy and just muy bueno.    As I entered into the bustling restaurant, the hostess seemed annoyed I didn't make a reservation.  Hey, it's a Tuesday night in a semi-shady part of Cleveland!  I didn't think I needed one.  Clearly this place has a happy hour that's extremely popular.  No sweat.  I'll wait the hour for a table and hop on over to the bar and partake in the happy hour.  And happy it was.    First, I ordered the usual: Ketel and tonic; juice of five limes.  So simple, yet surprisingly people always manage to get it wrong.  Momocho did not.  Served chilled and perfect.  Since there was an hour wait, I decided to order the blue crab guacamole (suggested the out-of-towner next to me).  Oh, the avocado gods were good to me!  Chunky guac with large morsels of crab and bits of corn.  Had it not been completely obscene, I would've tipped that bowl of guac over and shoveled it all in my mouth.    After the dip, I couldn't wait to have dinner.  So, my merry party and I pulled up extra chairs at the bar and decided to enjoy our meal there.  The menu basically consists of several types of taquitos.  The taquitos come with the main protein (mahi-mahi, shrimp, veggie, filet, etc), side of pinapple relish and a green salsa.  Each taquito entree comes with 5 flour-corn tortillas.  In the South, I'm used to taquitos being fried, but I like this different spin.  It was a lot cleaner tasting and you could really focus on the proteins.  I chose the Bariga taquitos or pork belly - the dish was an absolute stand-out.  Right amount of heat, the fat to meat ratio was even and cooked just right.  My fellow foodies had the alcachofa (artichoke taquito) and the pescado (mahi-mahi).    The reason this review is 3-stars instead of 4 is because the attitude I received from the hostess was poor, and the bartender could've been more engaging and descriptive.  If you're a 4 to 5 star rated place, you've got to at least act on-point.    Check this place out if you're looking for a newer take on some classic dishes in a vibrant and sexy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ohio city is one of those places that you get hit on by a man in a questionable  truck on the way into a restuarant to have the best meal of your life. I love Ohio City simply for this fact.  The cucumber margarita changed my life. As did the Blood Orange. I am not sure if I can drink a margarita anywhere else. Ever.  We had the taquitos, because in all honestly, I never spead a great deal of money on food, but I needed a treat. We went at happy hour. We got the steak and the duck. Both were absolutely fantastic. The pomengranate sauce was mouth-watering.  The salsa verde was also exceptional. The flavors here are paired so well. Our crab guac did not overwhelm us with crab, it just showed up once in awhile.  I am amazed by the tequila section on the menu. I had no idea tequila-making was such an art! haha  I want to make it back here for their tequila dinner. It sounds like my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"I came here trying something other than Barrio and, in short, I like Barrio better. Momocho was a bit more expensive and I didn't really care for the taquitos that much. I wish they had flour tortillas, not a fan of corn. The salsa we got (forgot which one) was okay, but it was more of a lot tomatoes than a thinner salsa. I can see why people like this place, but I don't know if I'll be back since I'm from Akron and a trip to Cleveland isn't an everyday occurrence."}
{"text":"Fun and refreshing margarita and guacamole sample collections. I liked the idea of upscale Mexican place idea. The first floor's interior and art are fabulous, the second floor room felt little too compressed. A little overpriced for the quality of main courses, but appetizers are delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food, waitstaff was attentive. Sat in the outside patio area on a warm spring night, I would highly recombined stopping in."}
{"text":"Came here with the husband and another couple on Friday night. I thought it was decent, I loved the guacamole trio, and my beef meatball entree was pretty good. I got a virgin mango margarita which was tasty too, but all in all I thought it was a little pricey. Husband had the pork bell tacos, he said it was more like pork rinds abs would get something else if we went again. In reality I would give this place 3 stars for the food, but our server was amazing so I'm bumping up to a 4. Did I like it? *shrugs* it was ok, but I won't race back."}
{"text":"Two words for this place: Holy. Guacamole.  I have I thing for trout, and if I see it on the menu, I order it. Smoked trout -- even better. I love bacon too, well who doesn't? And guess what? I love guacamole. So in comes this dish from Momocho that combines all three! So if you are into this sort of thing, I'd say it is a good marriage of spice, smoke, acidity, \"good\" fat and \"bad\" fat. This is hands down the best guacamole invention in Cleveland, if not, the world. Mind (and taste buds) blown.  Downsides: small space. crowded.   Reservations are a must."}
{"text":"This place has the best guacamole! Super cute place for a date. Amazing happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Really good food and magaritas. Had the blood orange magarita and the smoked trout guac with chips. That is the best guac in Cleveland. For the enteee, I shared 2 with my date and both were delicious. Really good atmosphere too."}
{"text":"In the US, It's pretty tough to find good Mexican food outside of the Southwest.  We live in New York City now, but my wife is originally from California and I lived out there for 11 years, so our palate for Mexican cuisine is pretty refined.  We still travel at least once a year to both San Francisco and San Diego (where her family still lives and where my friends live, respectively).  Both of us can tell the difference between Oaxacan & Baja Mexican for example...two VERY distinctively different styles of food.  With our credentials on the line, I think we have a right to have our opinions considered :)  I was visiting my family this past Summer in Cleveland (my hometown) and heard about Momocho's.  The location is great; a real up & coming neighborhood.  The decor is bold...lots of Dio de los muertos artwork all over from what I remember.  Very fitting for this restaurant.  They had a back patio that was very nicely set up and clean.  Staff was friendly and responsive.  We actually met the owner and I shook hands with him, telling him how I saw the episode of Diners, Drive-In's & Dives, in which Momocho was featured.  The owner seemed like a very nice person who cared a lot about his restaurant and the food he was putting out.  I know it's not a huge deal, but we both drank Pacifico beer.  Love it, but it's not easy to find, especially in a restaurant on the eastern part of the US.  Easily one of my favorite imports.  If you're drinking anything other that Pacifico when it comes to Mexican cerveza, you're doing it wrong.  Anyway, we started out with both the Chorizo Sausage and the Sofrito Green Beans.  I inhaled the Queso Fundido Chorizo.  Very balanced flavors that packed quite a punch.  And I'm not a fan of green beans at all, but my wife convinced me to try and I learned that I had been eating green beans wrong my ENTIRE LIFE!  These were amazing and exactly the flavors that you should get from such an otherwise disgusting veggie!  On to the next course, where I ordered the Tinga and she ordered the Chicharones.  This is where I abandoned my plate and began to divulge in the chicharones, which when cooked properly are out of this world.  Allegedly, Momocho's has some of the best and these were cooked to near perfection.  The Tinga on the other hand, left a lot to be desired.  This is where the last star fell from my rating.  What was brought to the table were large chunks of fairly dry chicken breast on skewers that were roasted with some spice.  My wife and I were shocked because if you've ever been out West, you would never EVER see this.  It seemed like a pretty big flaw, especially for someone who is trying to represent such world-class flavors and plates.  In Mexico (and Cali for that matter), chicken is pulled or shredded, never cubed.  And it's usually dark meat to give most flavor.  AND it's left to stew and marinate for a long time.  Sure, it's my fault for not realizing that when I ordered 'skewers', but to even have it as an option is a bit strange and far reaching for Mexican cuisine.  In my defense, there were many different plays on traditional Mexican food on the menu and this could have been one of them.  Not sure how you would skewer pulled chicken, but that's what an excellent chef is for!  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience there and we both vowed to go back for round two...next time I'll just have to put more thought into it."}
{"text":"I met a friend here on Wednesday around 6 pm to take advantage of the happy hour specials. I grabbed two seats at the bar while I waited for her to arrive. There were a few happy hour drink specials, but ultimately I decided to try a margarita. It didn't taste fresh, like it was made with a mix or something. I wasn't paying attention while he made it.   Once she arrived we decided to try the margarita sampler and those were much better. The spicy mango was my favorite. We split an order of the goat cheese guac and both ordered the chicken tinga (half price for HH) and everything was delicious.   I'll definitely be back to try more menu items preferably around happy hour because of the specials.   We were both lucky enough to park in the small parking lot so that was a bonus."}
{"text":"Yum!  I loved this place!  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but my co-worker really wanted to eat here, so I agreed.  I loved everything I had.  I ordered the rabbit empanadas and the grilled steak fajitas.  The grilled steak fajitas, or bistec belted in my mouth.  I demolished the whole thing, no problem.  Would not mind going back when in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Really fun environment and overall good food. We went for my birthday on a Friday night and sat at the chefs table. It wasn't quite what I expected, more of a ledge on the side of the kitchen but I didn't realize the restaurant is in an old house and the kitchen upstairs. We had so much fun watching and interacting with the team in the kitchen. They treated us to several extra tastes that made our meal super special. We loved the guac sampler, my favorite was the smoked trout and my husband's the pecorino and agave - sweet and savory and so good. My favorite side and really favorite thing overall if you can believe it were the sofrito green beans- SO. MUCH. FLAVOR. My husband loved he carnitas tacos, though the menu says taquitos, they were meat with corn tortillas on the side, which is not typically what you would consider a taquito. I had the crab and smoked trout tostada for my entree and it was strange in the best way is texture from the tostada, a blend of sauces, and even a fried egg on time. The chocolate pot de creme we tasted for dessert, full of cinnamon flavor, was fantastic and so rich! Negatives were the Brussels sprouts- interesting idea but really just not good and the bigger issue- I was so so disappointed to see that they use a microwave and not just sparingly. The chiles rellenos someone ordered were basically reheated with cheese melted in the microwave. For this level of a restaurant, I find that unacceptable and this is a much needed improvement I hope they will work on."}
{"text":"Dude. This place is a must-eat.   Having recently completed my cross country migration, looking back on the trip, I would say solidly the meal we ate here was the best of all.     I had the machaca | coffee + chile ancho braised beef brisket | guacamole tradicional with a side of beans. Everything about it was perfectly put together.   Apologies that I do not remember what my co-pilot ordered. But, I can tell you he loved it.   If I was Cleveland based I would eat here every week!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for quite sometime and haven't gotten a chance to try it until yesterday. Anyhow, the restaurant itself is a small two story building that has pretty good ambience and feels a bit intimate (good vibe for dates). It doesn't have too much Mexican inspired design but this is after all \"modern Mexican\".   We started with the empanadas and margaritas while waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. I ordered the traditional margarita while my girlfriend ordered the strawberry. For $8/8.5 it didn't quite live up to its asking price. It wasn't too flavorful and there's just a hint of alcohol. My margarita was also a bit too sour. It may also appear that they make batches of it ahead of time. The appetizer arrived with two pieces of empanadas, I would give the presentation full points (the empanadas were arranged on top of Mexican yogurt and tomato salsa topped with baby arugula). I was a bit disappointed since I barely tasted the lobster or shrimp bits. It needed more filling. Once the rest of the party arrived, we opted for the guacamole sampler. We chose the goat cheese, pineapple, and crab guacamole. The base guacamole was very smooth and flavorful. However, I felt that there was little distinction between the three flavors. I also felt that the chips overpower the guacamole due to its saltiness. The sampler was more than enough for the party of 4.   My main entrée was the machaca. It's a braised beef brisket flavored with coffee and other species served with a side of traditional guacamole and habanero hot sauce with corn tortillas. This was the highlight of the night. The brisket was very tasty with complex flavors. The brisket was moist with just the right amount of species and saltiness. There was also bits of onions and peppers in the dish. The accompanied guac and hot sauce made it even better.   I would definitely return, but I would probably just opt for one type of guac and try a different entrée."}
{"text":"I've tried out couple of dishes there, \"Warm green bean + fennel salad\" and \"Pork belly\" taquitos are superb! Last time I went there, they no longer carried this pork belly fajita on the menu though. This pork belly is definitely a bomb compared to other taquitos I've had; hanger steak, braised beef brisket and braised pork fajitas. I've gone to numerous mexican/south american restaurants in many cities and Momocho's cooking style and flavorful food really stands out from the rest. I am really happy to have found such restaurant in Cleveland. Coming from So Cal, I am very critical of mexican and sushi restaurants. Personally, I don't like their dessert menu which are either pudding, flan or fried ice cream. I love Momocho's food so much that I would love to order a dessert but they are all very very heavy after eating mexican dish.   I wish they would add light and fresh items, something as mango/passion fruit sorbet, frozen yogurt, fresh berries to their dessert menu."}
{"text":"Cool place, busy, nice staff, boar taquitos okay, guacamole better, coffee best. Pricey."}
{"text":"Having seen Momocho's on DD and D, I was excited to try it out.  I called about a week ahead of time and could only get the chef's table for a 6:30 seating unless we wanted to eat at 9:30.  We opted for 6:30.  I wasn't too sure what the chef's table was all about.  When I called I made mention that I was coming from Detroit and that this place was def on the list of places I had to try.  The person on the phone assured me if I was a foodie, I would enjoy myself.  And I did.  It was an awesome experience.  Mike, one of the two chefs who took care of us that evening was the real deal.  We got to sample some of the guacamole and the salsas.  Those poor guys never stopped moving the entire two hours we were there.  The chips were straight from the fryer, super warm and crunchy.  DH loved the guacamole with trout, bacon and peppers.  I thought the traditional was great.  I asked Mike and the amount of avacados they go through on a busy Friday or Saturday was insane - hundreds of pounds.  The kicker is that the kitchen is super tiny.  I mean not big enough for more than two people.  As Mike said, everything has to be fresh, there's no place to store any product.  They make it as they go.  For our meal we went with the taquitos - DH had the Carnitas (pork) and I had the tinga (16 spice chicken).  Looking back, we could have very easily split a dish, especially after the quac and salsa we devoured!  I liked them both - warning: the chicken was SPICY.  But not so hot that it killed your taste buds.  For dessert we just had to have the fried ice cream.  We shouldn't have, but after watching several orders of it being sent out from the kitchen, I had to try it.  The best part of it was the mexican chocolate sauce with the subtle hint of cinnamon.  Delish!  Why was this an amazing meal?  The food was very fresh and flavorful, it was my first experience at a chefs table and I loved chatting with Mike about the different options on the menu (and the free samples were a bonus).  Lastly, I have to  mention that when we arrived and I gave my name for the reservation the host was the same person I had made the reservation with on the phone and actually commented about us being from Detroit and asked how we liked Cleveland so far.  Seriously, where do you get that kind of customer service?  What was more shocking was when I mentioned that to Mike he said, oh, that's the owner.  Wow.  What a great guy.  On the way out he gave us directions to the pier so we could go and watch the sun set.  I watched the clip from DD and D that featured Momocho and yes, indeed, it was Eric, the owner.  If you're ever in Cleveland, do not miss dining at Momocho!!"}
{"text":"When I made our reservations for dinner I talked to owner/chef Eric. Told him we were coming into town just to eat at his restaurant and asked what hotel was close by, he was very helpful. On Sunday night we had a wonderful dinner, our server Lenore was very pleasant and helpful with her suggestions. I had a flight of margaritas....Lenore recommended the Red Pepper and it was wonderful, I also had the cucumber and blood orange. None were to sweet very tasty. We had the guacamole with Gouda and roasted garlic, again it was wonderful. I had the chile relleno and my husband had the trout both very good. We finished with the chocolate mousse. Wonderful evening and just when I thought it couldn't get any better Lenore handed me an envelope from Eric, there was a hand written note from him thanking us for coming in and also a few post cards and recipe cards.  I have worked many years in the restaurant business and customer service and it's the small things that make all the difference.....nice job Eric...we will be back.."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED the margarita and guacamole samplers! So many unique margarita flavors, and the goat cheese guacamole was to die for! The beef short rib tamales were another hit! Everything was delicious, our server was so friendly, great experience. Great Happy Hour specials too! I hope to come back every time I'm visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"It's like if you put the classy date night spot into barrio. Don't get me wrong, barrio is one of my favorite places in the entire Cleveland area, but it can't always be the place for a good one on one date. However, momocho is exactly that. The plates seem to be made for two and are a perfect shareable for you and your date. Oh! Definitely try the margarita drinks or something from the bar.   Service is exceptional, our waitress was fantastic. Kind, informal and very well managing of our time and hers.   Strongly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"Returned to Momocho tonight now that the weather is nicer. Had a bad experience last visit and posted a notice here. Heard from management after that posting who seemed truly appreciative of the feedback once he listened to my complaints. Went in tonight and sat at the bar like we usually do. Amazingly, Brook, one of the best bartenders in Cleveland, remembered us despite the long hiatus. Amazing service like we are used to. Only thing better would be to have Michael behind the bar with her, but he was running food and managing tonight. Food, likewise, amazing. Highly recommend the bolgogi toquitos or the pork belly ones with pineapple salsa. Loved them both and at an amazing price for happy hour. Best margaritas in Cleveland, for sure!"}
{"text":"Yum! Taco. This is a great place to come for Happy hour. Be sure to get there early because there's often people waiting when it opens. And there's not much room to wait in the front, so you might have to wait outside in the cold. We arrived a little after 5pm on a Friday with a group of 6, and we were able to be seated right away.   Happy hour here is awesome. It's $5 margaritas, $2 tecate, half off taquitos, and probably a few other things that I forgot. The margaritas a big and they pack a punch! The fun thing is they have a few different types of salt you can put on the rim. We tried the chili lime salt (tastes like a seasoning you would put on tortilla chips) and Hawaiian black lava salt with freeze dried ants (yes, ants like the bug! They're ground up so you don't see legs or anything). Both were okay, people probably liked the ants more than the chili lime.   The taquitos are like mini make it yourself tacos. A small plate of meat comes with two different kinds of sauces and 5 mini soft tortillas. You can ask for more tortillas if you run out. I really like the shrimp and duck, but they're all delicious! They're big enough to make a meal out of, but we usually like to share a few taquitos and also get some guacamole."}
{"text":"Had Valentine's Day dinner. The chips & salsa & guacamole were about the best we've ever had. Entrees were a beet romulacha and pork belly. Both were excellent,  made even better with warm tortillas and rice & beans. This is by far the best Mexican food in Cleveland. If you haven't been, you gotta go!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco spot in the nation! Corn tortillas, none of that flour bs, and a vast assortment of delicious guacs! I would recommend the pecorino guacomole, and the chorizo fundido to start! My favorite line items are the taquitos, and I'm always so full I don't have room for sides or dessert. The tequilas are great as well! Don't bring a date to this place, because you don't want to run into them here if it doesn't work out. What I mean to say is both of you will be frequenting this place if you try it once!"}
{"text":"I went here for a casual diner on a Friday night with some friends. The atmosphere was fun and vibrant and the people very interesting. We started off with a couple drinks (Mexican beer of course) and a great blood orange margarita. I got the ponacho i believe, it was a citrus glazed mahi mahi and it was excellent. As with most seafood dishes it wasn't incredibly filling and that is why i only gave them 4 stars. Other than that, it was a great place, great food, and very interesting drinks. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I'm years behind the hype, but I finally dined at trendy Momocho. Things started off on a positive note with some excellent guacamole (the one with the goat cheese) and chips... but -- and this is a pet peeve of mine -- when asked if we'd like some salsa too, we were charged $3 for a very small bowl of pretty bland salsa. For my entree I had the ahi tuna, which was of very high quality. However, I felt it was so blandly prepared and sided -- and served with tortillas that looked to have come out of a bag from the grocery store -- that I just couldn't get excited about it. From this one visit, I feel that maybe this just isn't my type of \"Mexican\" restaurant, although the ingredients are mostly top-notch."}
{"text":"I don't know why you would give this any less than five stars. Absolutely great experience. We got in immediately and upstairs. I had a great selections of guac and queso. They had multiple types of margaritas, which are worth doing the flights! I got to experience cow tongue on the menu as well, which was absolutely spectacular. Try it for something different and unexpected."}
{"text":"To be fair in this review, I feel its important to point out that I lived in the Southwest (AZ, TX, and NM) for 12 years and had lots of authentic mexican food of all different varieties. Since Cleveland isn't exactly a mexican hot-bed, maybe I should have set my expectations lower but after I saw it on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives, I figured it had to be nothing less than amazing and decided to check it out for myself.  First of all, Momocho is kind of in a rougher area. Although there is some gorgeous architecture around, the area is littered with homeless people and after walking around a bit my wife and I felt somewhat unsafe. Momocho, however, is quite a nice place inside. It is kind of surprising that it is located there. The feeling of the restaurant is somewhat swanky and upscale. We chose to sit outside (which is thankfully fenced in) and that area was also fairly nice.  We found the staff to be somewhat cold, although not exactly rude. They definitely weren't very helpful, which would have been nice since the menu is extremely confusing.   The menu options are basically guacamole and taco. The only real choices are what goes on/in them. You can choose between a bunch of different types of guac and the tacos give you the choice of what kind of meat/dressings go in them. We chose the pineapple guac and I got the boar tacos (my wife got pork).   Although people generally rave about their guac, I found it fairly flavorless and somewhat disappointing. I could barely taste the pineapple. Also, our tacos were VERY salty and vinegary.   I'm guessing my taste was biased due to my experience with Mexican food but nonetheless, it was disappointing. It was also very expensive. In my opinion, it was overpriced. The food certainly wasn't terrible, but it was very mediocre, and not note-worthy.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is great! But plan ahead to get a table. I would suggest making reservations or standing outside until the place opens because once the doors open all the first come first serve seating is taken up very quickly. You will normality wait 1-2 hours for a table. If your hungry I would get your own tacos. I know the menu says you get 5 shells but they are really tiny. Try the cucumber margarita, its different and refreshing and good. I noticed the happy hour is only an hour and a half which is really short I think. Since the place is small I think only a limited number will get the deals. You pay for chips and salsa here.  Chips are not unlimited, you have to pay for extra. So you only get one basket."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences we've ever had, not just dining experience, but customer experience.  The food blew our minds.  The chips and salsa and guacamole, the carnitas, and scallops were beyond words.  Incredible margaritas.  But the people made it a night we'll never forget.  We sat at the Chef's table and were treated like royalty.  Every person working there made it special.  We'll drive 4 hours to eat here again."}
{"text":"We went to Momocho on the early side of the dinner hour last Saturday.  The hostess was less than welcoming and mumbled something about the upstairs being full.  She quoted a 40 minute wait but it turned out to be much less.  When it came time to order the waitress informed our 14 year old son that he was too old to order a quesadilla.  She said the chef gets mad.  I have a message for the chef, get over yourself. This is definitely a more upscale Mexican restaurant and while my son is working his way toward food adventures, he's not quite there yet.  You should be thankful we are even exposing him to this level of cuisine so that some day he will appreciate it for what it is.  Shame on you for being pompous.  I'm giving them a second star because my husband and I enjoyed our taquitos. That said we will not return to this restaurant due to the snobby chef."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, we were lucky as we went on a Saturday evening without a reservation and still got table for 2 without an issue (it was a little early too). Plenty of good options for food and it was tasty. Slight mix up in the \"we thought we ordered it as an appetizer but they thought we ordered it as a side dish\" but no big deal."}
{"text":"We have gone to Momocho for the past 2 years on my birthday.  We're are from Columbus but last year decided to spend the weekend exploring Cleveland and decided to go back this year too.  By chance last year the only reservation available was the Chef's Table for 2 which seats you right at the kitchen overlooking it.  There are pros and cons to this seating, but it's definitely an experience to do at least once.  Pros: Watching the chefs work is mezmerizing and it really makes you appreciate your food more  You get to see the food being made and can all \"what is that??\" if something looks good and THEN you'll likely get a small sample of it.  If you like small talk with the chef this is a good place. If you're from out of town like us, it was fun talking about places around town to check out.  The dining pace is slower because the chef IS ALSO your server but you take more time to enjoy your food.  Cons: Essentially all of the pros can be made into cons depending on your mood.  You may night want to see the chefs work if you have issues about how your food is made.   You may see something that surprises you.  If you're not in the mood for small talk throughout dinner, this is not the seat for you.  If you're in a hurry this is not the seat for you.  We enjoyed it as a special occasion thing when we do, and I recommend people trying it once.  Aside from the Chefs Table, overall the food here is AMAZING.  The guacamole is fantastic and they have like 6 different flavor to choose from.  The goat cheese is my favorite.  I got the tempura fried Chile relleno and almost died when I ate the first bite because it was so good.   The previous year I got the Remolacha taquitos which were fantastic !  Also try the blistered shishito peppers as an app!  We were too full to try the desserts (except for the complimentary flan for my birthday) but the fried ice cream looked awesome.    Downtown Ohio city is a very short walk too, to help walk off the enormous amount of food you're sure to eat!"}
{"text":"I took my friend there last night, she had never been there and she is a CLE foodie. The atmosphere was great.   We split a  Margarita flight and  duck taquitos which was plenty for 2 ladies, we finished with the fried ice cream (which we ordered at 10:15pm after the kitchen closed and they still accommodated us) NICE JOB!!!!  Everything was yummy and the service was excellent.    The only draw back were the 4 people next to us at the bar that insisted on out talking each other very loudly- LOL"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The service is always good, but oh my good the margaritas and the food! So delicious! Get the sampler of the margaritas, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is great. Reminded me of the great Mexican fine dining restaurants my wife and I frequented while living in Chicago. I really enjoyed the dimly lit dining room and over all great ambiance. Wait staff was VERY friendly & made terrific recommendations based on our tastes and preferences.   Get there early and grab a cocktail from the bar. They have a great selection of drinks to chose from. When seated, order a combination of guacamole for the table. Be adventurous on the guac selection - they are all good. Oh and a friendly reminder: don't over-do it on the chips! Many different entrees to chose from depending on what you're in the mood for that night. I've been there just once but with a table of six...so had the chance to try a few different things.  Overall, I can't wait to go back and try something new next time. I hope this review was helpful and that you enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! This place was so good.  I cannot wait to go back!  We ordered the Goat Cheese Guac and it was perfect.  The chips were excellent as well.  For dinner I got some kind of steak dish- I forget what it was called but it was pretty much steak and tortillas.  The steak was so so good.  Juicy with a lime flavor.  My husband had the chicken which had a spice on it I did not like.  The decor was fun and the service was warm.  I cannot wait to go back and try more. Make sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"Decided to try Momocho last night after receiving several recommendations.  My sister and I started with drinks, she ordered the margarita sampler and chose the pomegranate, blood orange and cucumber options and said that they were all quite good. I ordered a spicy bloody mary, which was standard...nothing out of the ordinary.  On to appetizers! We love guacamole so we again went the sampler route and were able to try three different kinds: traditional, goat cheese with tomatoes and roasted corn and finally smoked trout. Out of all three, I would say that the smoked trout was the most flavorful of the three, which was surprising as I was expecting to enjoy the goat cheese and corn the most.  For entree's we decided to order two and share, the pescado (chimichurri glazed mahi mahi with a pineapple and jicama guac) and the camarones (garlic shrimp with a basil-avocado crema). I was less than impressed with the entree's and to be brutally honest, the shrimp dish was overloaded with garlic (and I LOVE garlic...it could have been reduced by half and still be really garlicky).   As far as service goes, no complaints there...super friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.   Overall, food was alright, but not worth our $100 bill. I would go back with friends for drinks, appetizers and ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm a Momocho regular.  I just simply love this place.  I've been challenged in ways that I've never expected by food.  I've had Spicy Mango margaritas burn by tongue and be soothed by chips and pepita salsa.  Momocho is an experience.  It's a celebration of the senses.  It's indulgent and wonderful.  To quote Rick James, \"IT'S A CELEBRATION!!!\"  Some people go to restaurants to celebrate a special occasion.  Going to Momocho IS a special occasion."}
{"text":"Excellent modern Mexican food. Had the shredded wild bore ! Really good. Also sampled other dishes my friends had. Absolutely fabulous !"}
{"text":"I've had an inner struggle for a while about whether or not to share my first visit to Momocho on Yelp... frankly because I'd like to try it more than once.   I was really hyped up about trying Momocho since I absolutely adore Mexican cuisine. Unfortunately, I think my over-excitement may have hindered me from the start because I just wasn't that wow'd with the food. It was good, don't get me wrong. Maybe I was just expecting some sort of heavenly experience. I don't know. It could also be I just didn't order the right item, which is why I'd love to go back and try some other things.   Let me start off by saying that for such a small space with a constant crowd, we were seated and taken care of miraculously well. I was not expecting that when I walked in and saw the cluster of people crammed into the bar area, waiting for a table. The owner was at the door, taking names and interacting with the customers. It was like a little celebrity moment since I had just seen him on the Food Network! (This visit was back in the early spring time.) Anyways, he told us about 30 minutes, so we ordered some beers at the bar. Within about 10 minutes, he had a table ready for us with a great server who was just specatular.   We started with the traditional guacamole, which was very fresh and tasty. To me, it's a little difficult to mess up guac, especially since avocados are so delish just on their own. The chips were house-made, perfectly crunchy and rather addicting. We decided to try the dish that was featured on the Food Network and also a vegetarian taco thing with portobello mushrooms. The meat seemed a little overcooked and I couldn't quite make out all the flavors that were described so eloquently on TV. The portobello tacos were good, but I don't know if I was in the mood.   I just wasn't blown away like I though I was going to be. Mexican food can be rather simple and still be ridiculously delicious. Momocho was definitely delicious, but I was hoping for more of a \"punch\" from the modern-side of it. There were a ton of other things on the menu that I want to try, especially after hearing many Clevelanders suggestions. I mean, if most of the city and America is raving about the food, I must have just missed something. I can't wait to go back and try some other fun menu options. Maybe I just need to step out of my comfort-zone. There definitely is no shortage of unique flavor combinations up Momocho's sleeve!   Summary: Great ModMex food, awesome decor and atmosphere, staff and service. Just need to try some different things next time around! I'm open to suggestions!"}
{"text":"Momocho is a great Mod-Mex place to eat. Love all the different types of guacamole. My favorite thing to get a Momocho is the cucumber margarita I love those things I could drink about a million, so refreshing."}
{"text":"Best guac & margaritas in town. Especially the spicy mango margarita. The short rib tamales are unbelievable."}
{"text":"I've never waited so long for so little food. Mediocre, incredibly overpriced food at that."}
{"text":"This place completely knocked my socks off. I was given one piece of excellent advice prior to going, and I will pass it along to you: no matter how tempting, don't get the guacamole sampler. Not because it isn't delicious, but because it is way too much food and you won't be able to eat dinner, which would be such a shame. Pick one guacamole, and savor it. I went with two friends, and we got the guac with crab, and never looked back.  Then the taquitos. Wow, that is a lot of fantastic food. I got the lamb, which was seasoned with mint and was complex and fantastic. Another friend got the carnitas, which were fantastic. The third friend picked the sleeper hit of the night: the beets. I do not like beets, pretty much ever, but the beet taquitos had myself and the other avowed meatarian at the table converted. I'm not kidding, they are that good. We also had the smoked gouda tamale dumplings on the side, and I wrote down all the things I could identify in the dumplings to try to remake them at home.   Possibly the thing that really made the night, though, was the fantastic service. The bar staff were friendly and attentive while we waited for our table, which is saying a lot because the placed was probably over the legal head count when we arrived. We had a reservation at 9:30PM, but the previous tables were still not really interested in getting up (and I can't blame them). The owner came and apologized to us, and paid for our appetizer. He really didn't have to do it, but he is clearly a good businessman and cares about quality of service. I would go back to this place in a minute, no matter how long I had to wait."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere for singles and date nights. Trendy modmex atmosphere with limited seating. Sat at the bar and had good service from bar maid. The Diet Coke was sweeter than usual and the chips were average. The guac is good with goat cheese, the salsa is good as well. My entree was the pork chop and it was over cooked but had a nice smokey mole sauce that saved it. Probably won't make the trip back but at least we tried."}
{"text":"Margarita flights AND guacamole sampler? Nuff said. Between a friend and I we tried the cucumber, hibiscus, spicy mango, blood orange and pineapple margaritas...they were all amazing but we'd have to give the high score to the spicy mango. Fantastic idea and highly recommended. We ordered the smoked trout guacamole and two others but I'll stop you there. It was phenomenal. Smoky and rich but not too spicy and if you're freaked out by the \"fish\" thing...get over it. You will NOT be sorry. Dinner = beef short rib tamales and pecan and pepita crusted trout. YOWZA! I wish I could say I ate it all but I was lucky enough to be able to enjoy the leftovers for breakfast. Flavorful and unexpected flavors made this a really fantastic dinner. Place was packed and not a lot of seating so make reservations or prepare to wait on busy weekends! Funky decor and just the right amount of sass. EAT HERE NOW!"}
{"text":"Best mole' sauce ever. Fabulous margaritas. Insanely great guacamole choices - try the blue crab.  The staff could not be any nicer. This is one of the best restaurants in the USA.  As Texans we are pretty discriminating about Mexican food. And Momocho is better than anything we have had in TEXAS!!! Try it, you will come away happy. Mike & Anne  Houston, TX"}
{"text":"I was so happy to have found a yummy, edible, actually enjoyable taco in Cleveland, I could have cried.  We had a friend in town and were nervous to take him anywhere for dinner, since we've had nothing but crap food dressed up as Artisanal Local Fresh Handmade since we got here. I'm not saying we need anything fancy, but jeeeeeeez it's been hard to find much that's even edible as we wade through the forest of well-reviewed plates of barf that is the Cleveland food scene. So we told him we were sorry in advance if dinner sucked super hard, then we took a deep breath and tried Momocho.  Hoo doggies! Smiles all around! Beers and micheladas were ordered, arriving at the table beautifully cold and mixed to perfection. At first glance, the guac mixtures seemed weird, but we tried the one with pecorino, black pepper, and roasted garlic. We also ordered the smoked gouda tamale dumplings, and I thought we were going to have to rumble over the last little bits of everything on the table. The waitress brought more chips when she took our taco orders, and we ordered the carnitas and the brisket tacos.   Everything arrived after a short wait, and things are done a bit differently here in that your protein is served very hot with sides of guac or salsa which compliment the spices in it, and your tortillas come on the side as well (steaming hot, thank you very much!), so you put it all together yourself. The menu says that one entree portion is enough for five tacos, but I'd say it's enough for about eight, depending on what you order. It would be great if there were more tortillas so you could double up for those more saucy fillings that leak through, but no matter. If we had it to do over again, we would have planned better and we each would have ordered a different filling so we could try more, but we shared our two huge portions of carnitas and single portion of brisket around the table and both of them were really good. Next time, we'll try the shrimp, mahi mahi, and tinga tacos, and maybe the achiote creamed corn (which is, from what I can tell from pictures, a take on elotes). And next time I am *definitely* getting a margarita flight. Maybe two! Because I want at least 5 glasses to raise to this 5 star dining experience, which has renewed my faith in trying new things in this city."}
{"text":"Their margarita sampler is amazing, I had it x2! Their chips are so fricking delicious, they are the perfect crispy salty goodness that you won't find at the likes of Chipotle. We had their guacamole which was also soooo good. I am so happy we checked this place out and will totally make an effort to make it here again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night with no reservation. Somehow, they were able to seat us in 10 minutes. There are long tables that most people shared with others. As with other Mexican-style restaurants, there are lots of sugar skulls and Lucha libres everywhere. The food was very good. The guacamole sampler is something we always end up ordering again and again. It's not authentic Mexican--it's a beautiful interpretation. I highly recommend Momocho."}
{"text":"I can be scared off from places by their crazy menus (my taste buds are pretty boring) but I decided to give this place a try because of the reviews (and the fact it was on 2 food network TV shows). The outside of the joint is definitely a dive but inside is rather mysterious (because it's so dark OR because it's filled with luchador masks? I may never know). Regardless, it's hip.   The food: Happy hour until 630pm!  Half off traditional margaritas/tecate AND their famous taquitos. We tried a couple different taquitos: machaca (brisket), tinga (chicken), chancho (wild boar), and bistec (steak). OMG they were all absolutely amazing! My vote goes to the bistec just because of the honey-chile chipotle mojo sauce. This sauce was definitely the tables favorite!  My issues: This place is not suitable for large parties!!! We had 8 people and had to squeeze at a 6-top (our fault--didn't want to split up but the staff was nice enough to allow us to do it). Another (fixable) problem was the policy \"no separate checks\" (on parties larger than 5)! Wtf?!?! Who carries cash these days and who can afford to pay for everyone's meals? Not me! Thankfully our server allowed us to split up our bill. And by us, we had to use our own pen and write out what each person ordered AND the cost to be charged to each card (we had to split tax/tip). Seriously? Come on guys, restaurants have rather intelligent POS systems these days!   None the less, we got an American math lesson with some great Mod-Mex food. Give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago, because I had had some of their stuff to go and really liked it. I ended up ordering something different than I intended, and did not like id that much (too much lime). I did really like their queso fundito. I honestly think I just made a bad choice for my lkiing, and definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"by far the best mexican food in Cleveland. the menu has a perfect mix of eclectic and classic mexican dishes and the servers are knowledgeable and patient enough to help guide you to the perfect dish. the guac, chips, and duck confit taquitos are not to be missed! the masa dumplings were great as well, and the margarita flights are just genius. can't wait to come back in soon for more!"}
{"text":". Food is always good. Last time we ate there was on the patio. There was only one stressed out  server . Service was very slow and she was rude. I have always enjoyed going there, but was uncomfortable to go back for a while. It has always been one on my favorites and I know we will definitely return to Momocho. Everyone is allowed a bad day."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan.  Goat cheese guacamole, WOW!  I have had Tinga twice and both times it was fabulous. Ask for the chipotle honey sauce to go with it. We had the chipotle pork and shrimp meals as well. Both times service has been outstanding. Pricey? It is more expensive than most Mexican places, but well worth it. Flavors are spot on. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The tour of the Momocho menu must start with the Margarita Trio - any three will do. Recommendations would include the Cucumber, Blood Orange, and Cactus.    Next on the list - Guacamole!  If you so dare, try the Trio here as well - but my favorite is the Goat Cheese Guacamole. OH YUM!  If you ask, they will put some bacon in there.  It is a great addition!  After - pick your fancy to round out the amazing meal.  Everything is delicious, unique, and a culinary experience on a plate.  Even the sides are amazing.  I've made a meal of the spinach, green beans, smoked gouda dumplings, and cauliflower and hominy fritas - when in the mood to have a little bit of everything!   Seasonal Special:  They have an amazing Corn on the Cob!  I crave this corn, and have been known to get emotional when it's removed for the winter months.  I'm not quite sure what they do to this corn, but when you go - TRY.  You will have to order more, because it's impossible to share this delicious treat!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my boyfriends birthday and I wanted to do something special for his birthday so we sat at the Chefs table. John was the chef tonight and did an amazing job of taking care of us. Our guacamole and chips were fresh and tasted delicious!! John also did an amazing job of explaining how he was preparing other foods.  We also got a chance to sample other items on the menu that we have not tried before. Our main entrees of trout and scallops were spot on.  To top it all off we ended with fried ice cream!! It was an amazing night and we can't wait to experience the chefs table with John again!!"}
{"text":"The cook\chef - Top Notch. Everything I saw come out of that kitchen looked delectable. I would go back just to try everything on the menu at least once. I overate gormet guac and indulged in some savory wild boar, so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss me some Momocho.  This was one of my favorite restaurants while living in Cleveland. Unfortunately, I was only able to come twice because of the long wait for a table. The place gets busy and gets packed! Not too big of a space either so kinda makes sense.  I wasn't able to make it to happy hour times, so I can only speak on the full menu and drinks. The food was....AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! My friend and I ordered a bit of everything and each item was more delicious than the one prior.   The drinks are also delicious, but definitely full of flavor (aka really sweet). But I guess I didn't mind since I had more than. I believe I tried their flavored margaritas, which were a bit pricey but also strong...so I guess that kind of evens things out.   I also liked the inside decor. Reminded me of nacho libre vibes. Overall, a great spot for dinner, special date, or just plain ol' good food!"}
{"text":"Cleveland continues to surprise me with its ' off main street' locations. This place is no exception.  Brought here by native Clevelanders, I was a little skeptical when entering the neighborhood. To my surprise this little unassuming front gives way to a dark, but inviting interior. Staff are incredibley helpful and put up with my group's antics with a huge smile.  Make reservations, and enjoy a fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times and both meals were horrible. Too bad cause it's a cool place."}
{"text":"I've been to Momocho a few times now.  The first time was for a full meal, and it was underwhelming, given the hype.  The margaritas and guacamole varieties (and I'm not really into guac) were fantastic.  The \"modern/fusion\" entrees on the other hand were quite disappointing.  3 stars.  Second time was on a Sunday, I believe, when they had a prix fixe.  That was just right.  The price for the quality/quantity of food made me glad to be there.  Third time was a late night after the roller derby.  Friends and I split appetizers and had margaritas.  I think this is the way to do Momocho.  The appetizers, guac, drinks, etc are really all so yummy.  So now that I know this is the way to do Momocho, 4 stars instead of 3."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience and food. We had our anniversary dinner here and they sat us at the chef's table which was quite the experience. If you like food and how it's made then this is the seat for you. Yes it will be noisy and fast pace and not your typical romantic dinner at the chefs table but it is the ultimate foodies seat. The chef provided extra tastings at no charge and never missed a beat.  As for the food. It is some of the most diverse flavors you will experience. I suggest the green beans and the short rib meal. The drinks are also awesome including the margarita flights. Try the bell pepper margarita."}
{"text":"First time visiting here- in the 5 years I've been here from Boston- I can honestly say this place is 100% worth visiting. Only complaint was the phone call to the hostess, however in retrospect she was super busy. Getting there, no reservation (around 8:30) waited only 20 minutes for a seat. Which was no problem as we had a drink to tide us over. Seating was efficient, our server was awesome. Friendly, funny, and most importantly helpful with the menu. Food was VERY tasty, fresh, unique and for me- the ingredients were the right combination of flavorful, fresh and enticing.   double thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Sorry - I just don't get the hype.  I thought the guacamole was good and I appreciate the interesting combinations - and the margaritas were nicely done.  Unfortunately, everything else was bad, particularly the service."}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting from out of state and wanted to treat her to some great Cleveland restaurants so imagine my embarrassment and disappointment when we  ended up spending FOUR hours at Momocho's mostly waiting for food and drinks. I realize that it was a Friday evening and this place is popular, but the five of us decided the over an hour wait for a table would still be worth it. We got our drinks right away from the bar, but our guac sampler took an hour to come out then it took another hour plus to get our entrees after we were finally at a table and able to order. The sky started out nice and sunny but by the time we got to eat it was completely dark and since we were seated on the patio we were being attacked by bugs. Everyone was cranky and lost their appetites so we ended up taking most of the food home.   The excuse the waiter had was that they only had two cooks in the kitchen. Um hello! If you know you're a busy establishment on the weekends then you should hire some more stinking help! Or at the very least offer some free salsa or drinks for the unacceptable wait your patrons put up with or don't seat more than you can appropriately accommodate! Were they flying the fish in from Hawaii?! Were they waiting on the avocados to ripen?!  Some restaurants are well worth the wait for a table because you know you will be well taken care of and enjoy an amazing meal during a reasonable time frame, Momocho's is not one of those places. Instead this place is better reserved for visits at 4pm during the week. I would avoid anything after 5:30pm and weekends altogether. I have never walked out of a restaurant before, but I most certainly wish I would have at Momocho's.   Furthermore, why can we not split a check for only five people? Why is 20% gratuity automatically taken out for five people? Usually this practice is reserved for large parties. If you had high quality business practices and excellent service there would be no worry for tips and no need to force gratuity."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'll start with the one redeeming factor: very good guac.  However, that guac arrived at our outside waiting area exactly 50 minutes after I ordered it at the bar.  Yes, 10 minutes short of an hour ... for guacamole.    The food was over spiced to make up for what it lacked in substance and preparation.  The shrimp was overcooked with a rubbery texture and the mahi was no better.  The brisket was mediocre at best.    Not only was the food underwhelming, but from the start we were treated with an arrogant attitude by everyone from the hostess (who rolled her eyes when I asked for the 50 minute guacamole to be comp'd (which never was ..)) to the bartender with whom we placed our initial order, and continued to follow up on the guac as 20 min, 30 min and 45 min had passed.  And as a couple recently transplanted from NYC, we know the difference between arrogance and deserved pride in your product- this was most definitely the former.  Finally, to cap off a 3 hour painful ordeal, as we were walking downstairs, my wife asked for help fetching our stroller from the outdoor garage (as they did not accommodate our outdoor seating request) to which the waitstaff replied with chagrin, \"it's right there, you can get the door for yourself right?\"  Funny, as they mentioned they \"love children\" when we called for reservations.  The \"slogan\" on the bottom of the menu serves more as a disclaimer than a motto in my opinion.. \"we only serve those happy to be here\"  Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"The place is unique, what can I say? And when clever ingenuity yields good food, drink (you gotta try the margaritas, there's a bunch of really cool ones), and experience, that scores  major points in my book. I can understand how some people might not be \"wowed\" with their food, but it was good enough. WOW on the dessert though, for sure!  I had a great time with friends here, I'd recommend at least trying it out."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  In town from Chicago and was referred from a great friend who lives in Tremont. Thank you Stacie and Jimmy!!  Start with a cucumber margarita and don't miss it without the chili lime salt rims; trio of guacamole - traditional,  goat cheese and gouda...taquitos with hangar steak and wild boar...nothing bad to say and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been trying to eat at Momocho for a couple of years now.  Being a fan of Mexican food and a wannabe foodie, I knew this was a place I had to check out.  It was worth the wait.  First of all, we arrived about 15 minutes before open (5:00 for dinner) and were able to find parking in the lot adjacent to the restaurant.  The door was opened about 10 minutes early so we were able to go right in and sit at the bar (we had no reservation).  I strongly recommend this if you do not have a recommendation as it guarantees you will get seated promptly.  The decor and ambiance are enjoyable, and the dining area around the bar is cozy, but not crowded.  On a return visit I hope to see the rest of the dining areas.  My wife and I shared two margarita samplers, and there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.  I will warn regarding the spicy mango - it is SPICY.  The mango also takes on a very tomato-like quality when combined with the spices.  I imagine it's what a bloody mary tastes like (I don't drink them).  All beers are Mexican/Latin, mostly familiar names.  The Brazilian lager was light yet had a nice flavor, and I could easily picture myself taking down a six-pack on a hot summer day.  We ordered some standard guacamole and some pico de gallo, both of which were pretty good.  We also tried the queso fundido, which my wife believed was the highlight of the night, food-wise.  We ordered, but only sampled two different taquitos - the machaca (braised beef) and chancho (wild boar).  Both were tasty and came with superb condiments.  We also ordered a side of green beans on the recommendation of the bartender, and she was spot on.  The green beans were extremely flavorful, and represented what Momocho is about.  STRONG flavors that you will take home with you, but in a very pleasant way.  My only complaint is that the beef brisket was a touch on the dry side, but other than that our experience was high quality.  It wasn't the life-changing experience I was hoping for; just a good restaurant that knows what its doing and does it well."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant to stop and eat at while I was in Cleveland. And I think it may have been the reason I've been converted to a guacamole lover.  The restaurant is located in the trendy Ohio City neighborhood. We came here on the recommendation of my brother in law, who had been here before. It certainly didn't disappoint!   We started with the guacamole appetizer which had three different types of guacamole. We got a spicy guacamole, a blue cheese guacamole, and a goat cheese guacamole. I know. These all sound very gross, but I assure you, they were divine! I especially loved the goat cheese guacamole.   We also got a salsa appetizer. The salsa here is fresh and the chips are delicious. Not too salty, and they didn't get soggy when coming in contact with the salsa which is key to a good chips and salsa experience.   I ordered the scallops for dinner and they were pretty delicious. I loved the sauce they put the scallops in.   The service was on point here. The water cups were endlessly refilled and our server was very friendly and answered any questions we had.   Definitely a great spot for Mexican food. in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My second time here, but I live out of town so I'd probably go more.  I recommend the Guac(all of them), duck confit, pork.  I wouldn't recommend the wild boar, its really salty.  And of course a pitcher of the cucumber margs will do you real good. One other thing, prepare to be there awhile, they even say it you should plan on being there at least 2hrs."}
{"text":"Greeted nicely by hostess.  Food at the tables looked amazing.  Then down hill in a hurry. The bartender (tall, goofy hair guy) informed me that happy hour is only for those seated. I explained we were waiting for a table to no avail. May be the rudest bartender in Ohio. Lost my business forever."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, place is full of character, nice patio, good food, great guacamole and margaritas (blood orange is best)! HH is great (get there by 5:30 for a seat). Its 1/2 off reg margarita and all tacos (think fish, tuna, not just steak, chix). The artichoke taco is the best, and i tried most of them!"}
{"text":"Momocho is the best Mexican Restaurant in the area.  Located in a small building in the middle of Ohio City, the place feels intimate and electric.  The lights are dim, but bright enough to see the eclectic decorations ranging from Lucha Libra memorabilia, to customized bikes.    I was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar during happy hour.  Service by the bartender was warm and attentive.  Of course while sitting at the bar waiting for my order, the food for the people on either side of me was delivered and I was surrounded by wonderful smells and sights.    With my appetite whetted the blistered shishito peppers came out quickly; for $2 at happy hour you get a great appetizer or bar snack.  A large helping of peppers comes perfectly grilled; the peppers are meaty with their flavors concentrated and then complimented with the chili lime salt.  Salty, with just enough heat I could eat these every day.  For my entree I went for the half price Camarones Taquitos; which are shrimp with peppers and onions in a flavorful sauce, served with soft corn tortillas, an avacado basil crema and salsa verde.  The shrimp are plump and well cooked and compliment the peppers and onions.  The vibrant green salsa verde brings a bright herbal punch with the crema providing a mellow finish.  Together the dish is awesome, exciting you with an exciting presentation, an enticing aroma and providing a flavor punch.  Momocho delivers on all levels, service, ambiance and most important flavor.  If you can get there at Happy Hour you can get a great deal.  If you like Mexican it is a must try."}
{"text":"One of the top three restaurants in Cleveland.   It's not really fair to call this a Mexican restaurant because that conjures up incorrect images for most people--this is not an independent Don Pablo's, this is modern fusion-y \"Mexican\" food that is simply delicious.   I had a cucumber margarita there that was awesome, along with a scallop entree that was perfect. Goat cheese guacamole is pretty much too good to be true.   I would probably eat here a few times a month if I could afford it, but it's more like a few times a year. It's not incredibly expensive but it's no normal night out either. I definitely recommend reservations though, this place always seems busy. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat & drink in Cleveland. I've been here more times than I can count & never have had a bad meal.  This place is better each time I go.  I would say my only complaint would be the awful parking on the street and forget about the tiny parking lot.  The decor is fantastic and a great conversation piece.  I recommend starting with the 3 guac sampler.  My favorite item(s) isnt even an entree but are the taquitos....the Machaca (coffee beef brisket) and the Pescado (pineapple mahi mahi) can be meals in themselves.  Usually we will get a group of 3-5 and everyone gets one taquito as their meal and we each sample everyone elses.  Make sure to get a side of the habanero pickled onions too....they go great with everything.  Served cold but still great."}
{"text":"Very delicious. That said, it sucks when you spend a small fortune (I work in nonprofits...so small fortune to me) on dinner and get nickle and dimed on items that tend to be complimentary. For example, to get charged for every basket of chips. A little complimentary goes a long way."}
{"text":"This is only for the guacamole since that all I had. I did eat before I came here soooooo  yeah.  The guac is AMAZING as are the chips they serve with them. I tried the guac sampler of crab, pineapple, and regular. They have this down to a science. I am not a huge fan typically but this was one of the best that I have had since my wife always orders guac. Even if you don't want a meal, this is a great snack that you can enjoy over drinks and possibly have some to take home since they don't give you small portions.  The menu look awesome, have a lot of traditional Mexican dishes with their own twist to it. I look forward to trying the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be the dissenter here in not giving Momocho 5 stars. Perhaps the expectations were just too much.  I'm a Mexican food (NOT just Tex-Mex) afficiado and love Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill so my expectations were high that Momocho might be Cleveland's answer to Mexican.  The atmosphere is casual and fun.  The server was wonderful. Knowledgeable and appearing at just the right time.    The food was the let down.  The Goat Cheese/Poblano Guacamole was an average, not great, guacamole studded with bits of goat cheese.  The poblano wasn't evident and its flavor was non-existent.  The bright Salsa Verde, though, was fresh tasting and just slightly spicy.  Our Michelada style beer was good and the margarita was really great.  We tried the recommendations of our server.  However, the Camarones Taquitos contained several large, garlicky shrimp but they were overcooked and rubbery.   The Machaca Taquitos as a tender beef brisket seasoned liberally, almost overwhelmingly so, with cinnamon.  The Sofrito Green Beans had a vinegary bite.  The predominant flavor in all the food was salt.  After a salty Michelada, salty Margarita, salty chips, the heavily salted beef, shrimp and green beans just proved to be salt overload.    I think another visit is warranted to try the duck and pork chops to see if the kitchen just had an off night."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite bars for years but I'll never return after my experience on 3/24/16. The bartender was VERY rude to another customer which made my friend and I uncomfortable. When we brought up that we were surprised about how she treated the other customer, she took my margarita sampler out from under me and said that we needed to leave. If there was some rationale for her rudeness, I'm sure she would have justified her behavior at this point- but she did not. She got rid of us as quickly as possible, probably knowing that her behavior was unacceptable. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. The guacamoles and margaritas were especially good. The staff was friendly and attentive. Decor was a little cheesy, with a big display of tshirts up front, and I would've liked the lights a little higher. But none of that was enough to make me unhappy. Its a little pricy, but certainly a place I'd go again."}
{"text":"Torture.  Walked right in @ 10 pm on Saturday night, it was busy but no wait.  I imagine it can get very busy (good for them, not so good if you dislike lines/waiting). I'd suggest get the $7 nacho sampler; that only took about 10 minutes, the 16 spice chicken (name?) took over 45 minutes...  One item??!! (and yes it was very good but small portion)  Brutal, it's so loud inside, just an exercise in patience that we weren't looking for.   Staff was friendly, I would never return, nor recommend it to anyone.   TOO DARK.  TOO LOUD. WAY, WAY TOO SLOW."}
{"text":"Delicious! The sauce combinations were amazing! I had the pork carnitas and my husband had the lamb enchilada with mole sauce. The pork melted in your mouth and the sauces were a perfect combination of tangy and spicy which balanced the savory meat. The mole was delicious with a subtle chocolate hint. The atmosphere was cozy, friendly and playful. The bar tenders whip up some delicious and creative margaritas with homemade juice mixes. Staff were attentive, friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful upscale modern Mexican restaurant tucked into a quiet neighborhood.  We found street parking and got right in.  We had called for reservations and were told they were full, but we could try walking in.  No wait at all, so that worked out well for us.  The inside was a little dark and heavy, but luckily, we were able to sit outside on the spacious patio on this beautiful evening.  The service was just the right amount of advice and hot homemade chip refills, while allowing us to take our time with the absolutely wonderful food.  We started with the guac trio and honestly, four of us could have made a meal out of it.  So good with unique flavor combinations that didn't overpower the avocado.  However, we did get a few more things.  The artichoke taquitos, plus a few sides, were more than enough to share and we were stuffed!  One of my friends got the cucumber margarita - delicious and refreshing, while I stuck to my favorite, the michelada, as I describe it, a \"bloody mary beer\".  Yum! Wholeheartedly recommend this place to who ever I know in Cleveland."}
{"text":"GUACAMOLE HEAVEN. That and margarita sampler to treat your mouth to a party!  Momocho's was actually my last Mexican cuisine before heading over to Korea for a 3-month internship, aka land of the $4 dollar/avocado. In my avocado-deprivation state of mind, I could nostalgically think back to the guacamole sampler... and the wonderfully various guacamole dishes, all made to emphasize the beautiful avocado. (Did I mention that I love avocados?)   If you are eyeing the gouda + honey guacamole, however, I would make sure to pair that with the bacon + smoked trout guacamole as the honey gets to be really sweet (especially when paired with creamy avocado)!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale Mexican food place that is to die for. Their chef-made food is seasonal, so it changes all the time. My favorite part is the various, unique guacamoles they make! I once had one that had smoked Gouda and agave nectar in it.... soooo freaking delicious.  On my birthday last year we sat at the chef's table, and got to watch the chef cook all night. He was super friendly and let us try all kind of things for free.   Also, their margaritas are LIFE. Lawwwwd praise it. So good."}
{"text":"Rude hostess aside (recurring theme in Cleveland after our experience at Melt?), everything at Momocho was pretty perfect. Mexican is not my favorite thing in the world, but Momocho impressed me, making the cuisine creative and interesting without veering into Tex Mex territory. I certainly haven't had anything like it before.  I wanted to try their chevre guacamole so bad, but one of my friends is vegan so instead we had pineapple. It was so very fresh, and although I prefer more garlic, I could not stop eating it. I had to force myself though so I had room for my amazing lamb taquito. Usually the uniform texture of ground meat is a turnoff for me, but the addition of ground walnuts provided a perfect crunchy contrast. All of the taquitos on the menu sounded amazing, but I think I made a good choice.  We finished with the jalapeño bread pudding. If you were born without a sweet tooth, like me--get this! I love a little bit of savory in my desserts. And I can't forget to mention the cucumber margarita. At first, i wasn't sure if I liked it (oddly enough, while I'm not a big fan of sweet food, I generally go the opposite with drinks. but who can resist cucumber...not me!). It kind of tasted like spicy pickle juice...but after I acclimated myself with those first few odd sips, I decided I was in love. It was unusual for sure, but refreshing. I can imagine this as a perfect brunch drink.  In all honesty, I would come back to Cleveland just to eat at Momocho again. Who's down for a roadtrip?"}
{"text":"So, I tried making a reservation for is place and was surprised that Fridays were pretty booked unless you wanted a 9:30 pm reservation( who wants that??)  Well, they have a gorgeous patio, but unfortunately it closed right after I walked in as they were having a 'slow night'c bummer cos it was a gorgeous day in Cleveland!!  We started off with some margaritas.. Oh my!  I had the blood orange .. It was so good and not too sweet, my friend had the spicy mango that was so good, if you've had the mango Indian drink, maaza before, it's kinda like with tequila and spice..:)..   On to the food.. We had the chipotle, crab and corn guacamole... Delicious.. Very good!!..  I had the shrimp which was good but mediocre and my friend ad the machacha briske which was way better.. We ended with another round of margheritas..I the strawberry mint which was okay and my friend the hibiscus!!! Omg .. So good..( I obviously ordered the wrong things ..:)).. All in all it was a good meal.. Our waiter was friendly and made some good suggestions!!. The bartender was awesome is he charged my dead I phone and when I walked over to the bar .. He just handed it to me.. Didn't even have to ask.. And that my friends is service! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of tequilas. Bartender is very knowledgable and super helpful. Salsas were okay; I expected more. Chicken taco was seasoned very well. Ambience is nice, the location feels like hide gem in a neighborhood, started getting crowded in the evening right before we finished up."}
{"text":"Holy cow were were happily surprised! Best guacamole I have ever had. We sat at the bar. Food and service was impeccable. We cannot wait to return. Will make the drive from Michigan to eat here."}
{"text":"Horrible service, refused to give us separate checks, and on top of it all, included 20% gratuity (I assume based on the fact we were a party of 6) when he didn't deserve 10%.   Our meal was 2.5 hours long because the service was so slow AND when I did receive my entree, it was incorrect and had to be remade.   Our server was also very aggressive/rude and demanded our attention. He made it all about him, not the dining experience.   Sufficed to say, I will never return to this place, nor will any of the members of my party."}
{"text":"Visiting for out of state we went here after seeing the sights.  We didn't have reservations but we're seated right away on a Wednesday night @ 6:30.   The chips and salsa were then best.  The first problem was the waiter got my order wrong. Due to time I couldn't wait for the correct dish. I did not like the food at all, and didn't finish it. It was the fish and not cooked well.  None of our party really liked their food.  Service was good.  Not the top of recommendations."}
{"text":"Food is great. I highly suggest this place. Don't forget to reserve a table. This place gets crowded and if you don't have reservations you should wait more than a hour. I had lam shank which was great. I enjoyed my time in this place"}
{"text":"Momosho was a pleasant surprise when it comes to looking for good eats in the area.    1. Love the decor: super modern and stylish but comfy and unpretentious  2. The drinks are quite nice: I really enjoyed the blood orange margarita with brown sugar on the rim.  I only ordered one but wish that I would have ordered a second.  3. The food is fantastic: We ordered the guacamole sampler and got the pineapple, the crab and sweet corn, and the smoked trout.  The crab and the sweet corn was my personal favorite while the pineapple and smoked trout tied for second.  The pineapple surprised me since halfway through there's a definite taste of spice.  It suggested that it may not have been blended well since the pineapple was primarily on top and the cayenne was more towards the bottom.  Our waiter talked the sampler up saying it would be incredibly filling, but in my opinion it was average appetizer size.  We definitely had room for more.  So we ordered taquitos and I got a side of the corn.  The corn in a cup is something I would not recommend.  It's very liquidy at the top, which I found strange...but I was happy when I actually got to the corn.  My boyfriend ordered the dunk confit taquitos and I got the atun (tuna).  The portions are a great size and come with five soft corn tortillas.  By boyfriend was pleasantly surprised with the duck confit, saying it was seasoned perfectly.  The tuna was quite good too.  It was paired with pickled jalapeños...which you'd think was hot but was actually savory and sweet.  The accompanying sauces are also great complements: a chimichurri and some sort of sweet, smoky, barbecue-like salsa.  Monosho is a great addition to the areas restaurants.  Friendly crowd, great drinks, and great food.  I had a pretty good time here and would love to return for happy hour."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying things to me is sharing an evening with the best food, friends, drinks and atmosphere.  The location of this scenario can change, but the feeling and tastes are all the same.  Momocho created that experience for us.    It's a restaurant I've been eager to try and, turns out, rightly so.  Everything from the zany lucha libre decor and lively energy to the prompt seating (we had a reservation) and upbeat, knowledgable and friendly waitstaff.  I was impressed from the moment we walked through the door.  Tom was our server and did well to explain the menu with his charm and playful personality.  My dining companions and I loved it and appreciated that he corrected a couple of drink errors he made by comping that portion of the bill, no hassle required.  But, the food!  Good gracious, it stands alone.  We started with margaritas (the cucumber & blood orange are a must!), plus one of their seven guacamole combinations (blue crab, corn, chile chipotle) and shared between us a variety of their signature taquitos: machaca, bistec, pescado and pato (I ordered the pato because they were out of the atun).  We all marveled at how well the proteins and sauce pairings went with each other. Each dish was a happy marriage of flavors (bravo, Chef Williams!).  My only teensy tiny complaint was that my duck was on the dry side, but nothing a little pomegranate ancho barbacoa sauce couldn't cure.  Momocho is another Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives winner!"}
{"text":"For some reason, the owners of Momocho did a better job with their second effort, El Carnicero. A lot of what you can find there originated from or is inspired by the food here. It's a bit pricey and most of the food is fine to good, but doesn't seem to justify the cost.   Let's get this straight: Momocho is NOT Mexican, but Mexican-fusion or inspired. It rankles me when they win \"Best Mexican\", because it's not Mexican in a true sense. What they do offer is favourful and generally prepared better than at most places.   For a better, more concise menu, head over to El Carnicero in Lakewood instead."}
{"text":"Yup. It's just as yummy as you expect. The guac trio is delicious. The bleu cheese is super thicky and every order of chips was still warm.  My order of carnitas taquitos was spicyyyy. I guess make sure you know the hotness level of what you're ordering. The portabello is thick cut and surprisingly meaty."}
{"text":"This restaurant has trendy decor. Very pricey, even though they have tortilla chips and salsa, it doesn't come free with the meal, you will have to pay for that too. The menu is very complicated, it has all the protien items in bold, and in a bigger font, I think my Spanish is okay, but the menu is difficult to understand it put it a strange order, I had to ask the waitress for help a few times, I have never felt so clueless.  The food was cooked to perfection, a very good meal, the decor seemed dark, pictures of random skeletons in places,  but very good service, not your typical Mexican restaurant, more of a bar. The have seating in different areas, like in the basement or in the back. I know, very mixed reviews here just a 3 star. Because of the way they do the pricing and the atmosphere I may not be back, but a believe this place can be for some people."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always make it a pint to come here when I was visiting from Denver and now that I live here I'm happy to have this as an option for Mexican food.  I had the margarita flight and used a discount through CLEseats app. The cucumber was the show stopper.  Also had a flight of guacamole. Goat cheese, pineapple, and pimento cheese. They were all amazing.  For my entree I had the chile relleno. It was amazing! It looks like the used a large poblano pepper. I've typically had it with New Mexico hatch chile.   Everything was amazing including the service"}
{"text":"Cute spot to go on a date! Really nice atmosphere-cozy, dark, cool aesthetics, fun bartenders. Would definitely recommend for appetizers (because it's a little pricey) or if you're feeling adventurous with drinks. The margarita flights give you the perfect portion to try crazy flavors like cucumber or blood orange. The menu was a little confusing with all of the different combos, but my friend and I were super happy with our choice to split the smoked gouda tamale dumplings . Also loved that there were a ton of GF and vegan options."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Margaritas are addicting, and the guacamole recipes make it difficult to pick a favorite. We went on Sunday afternoon and sat right at the bar. The bartender is awesome, and we will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Probably the best guacamole I've ever had, the flavor burst onto your tongue with the sheep milk gouda and Ohio honey. Our waitress was super pleasant and she recommended the coffee braised beef and pecan encrusted trout, both of which were delightful. We then shared the fried ice cream which clearly benefited from some wonderful homemade sauce. Oh, and the Sangria was also a treat. They tout themselves as Mod Mexican and they do a fantastic job at it. Great place to go in the cool Ohio City area."}
{"text":"Holy mediocre food, Batman!  I usually wait about 24-48 hours before reviewing a restaurant, but I had to get this one in right away.   Tonight was our second attempt eating here. The first time, we were laughed out of the joint because of our disbelief of a two hour table turn at 9pm on a Saturday night. Allow me to save you money and 2-3 hours of your life, DO NOT EAT HERE. Reasons are listed below.   The margaritas are terrible. Really?  You want to charge me $8-$9 for a margarita from a plastic jug with close to bottom tier tequila?  I consider myself a margarita connoisseur. Charging anyone said amount of money for something that isn't made to order is a crime and an embarrassment. I couldn't taste anything that resembled an alcoholic drink due to all of the sugar. Thanks in advance for the hangover and stomachache tomorrow. The owner should be ashamed.   Point two - you tell me there is a two hour wait for a table and then magically 3 open tables appear in twenty minutes. Joke.... Sounds like you are trying to make this place sound more in demand than it should be.   Just to break up the negative - the goat cheese guacamole was pretty good. Chips, not so much.   Tamale - this make me rage in anger typing this. After having this hyped up by the waiter, we got this as one of our entrees. Mistake number 25. We could have made this at home. The tamale portion of the meal was atrocious. Just because you throw a can of corn in the masa does not mean the tamale will come out moist and delicious. The tamale was crumbly and dry. The short rib on top had some good flavors. Too bad my wife and I both had to spit out chucks of fat into our napkins. Poor poor poor dish. If you are going to charge me $17 for something that cost $6 for you to make, it better be executed perfectly.   Steak tacos - the steak was cooked well. I love hanger steak but I was not blown away. However this portion of the dinner was decent. Except for you serving me Mission brand tortillas that were heated in a microwave. At least throw them on a flat top if you aren't going to make them yourselves. Which you should be doing considering the prices on the menu.    In general the sauces and salsas were all pretty good!  Rather than ordering another terrible margarita I opted for a Pacifico to close my meal. In all honesty, I've had better margaritas at a state fair. I thought about ordering a flight of margaritas, but then I saw all 8 of those come from plastic gallon jugs as well.   Our waiter was decent until we got to the end of the meal. He threw us a sales pitch for us to visit, what I assume is their sister restaurant, SOHO for brunch. Pass. My wife then made a comment about a drink at a Michael Symon restaurant to which the waiter rebutted that Cleveland restaurants all do the \"Michael Symon\" thing, but he just gets all the credit.  Whatever. Won't be back. Maybe next time I'll hit up a Michael Symon joint rather than be a patron of a place trying to profit off the \"hipness\" of Ohio City, Cleveland."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't give this 5 stars is a hooligan. Definitely in the top 20% of restaurants I've been to. Get the spicy mango margarita - it's to die for (not literally). While you're at it, get the margarita sampler and snag a blood orange and hibiscus.   When you get the meals, they are pretty big. Could be big enough for two if you aren't going to eat like a cow.   Bartenders are terrific. Keep doing your thang ladies and gents."}
{"text":"Blood Orange Margarita and Guac Sampler.  Done.  The smoked trout and bacon, goat cheese, and crab and corn guacamoles are so, so, so good.  The blood orange margarita is also fantastic.  Actually, all of the margaritas I've had here have been fantastic.    If you still have room after the guacamole, the taquitos are the way to go.  If you don't know what a taquito is, think fajitas and you'll be pretty close.  You get a plate full of meat/veggies/sauce, and a side of corn tortillas to build your own tacos.  My favorites are the tuna (sushi grade, seared with avocado leaves and served extra rare), the coffee braised brisket, and the wild boar.  Like a previous reviewer said, everything is pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that sort of thing, I'd proceed with caution.  And when I say \"spice\", I don't just mean it'll burn your tongue, but that they use a lot of different spices.  So if you have a sensitive stomach, again, proceed with caution.  I don't have much experience with the \"entrees\", but from what I've seen I'd say stick with the taquitos.    For everyone else, the food is delicious and the servers are always super friendly.  It's in a tiny old house, so you'll definitely need to make reservations.  I called first thing on a Tuesday (they're closed Monday) for reservations that Friday, and there were only 4 left when I called.  Something I stumbled on entirely by accident one time was that you can actually reserve the chef's table if there are only two of you.  I didn't know that's what we were getting when I made the reservations, but it was awesome.  We got samples of stuff that's not on the menu and the kitchen staff left you alone so you didn't feel like you were being pestered.  It's a cool spot if you're going as a duo.    Happy hour has half-price margaritas and cheap guac!  Totally worth making a trip for."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and service was fast. The food was good. Recommend the chips and guac"}
{"text":"By far the best margarita in the city of Cleveland. Hands down. I am not kidding! On top of that the food is divine and the service is great.   The only reason I don't give Momocho 5 stars is because of the limited space. There is really hardly any room for a decent gathering and you often have to share tables making it a little less intimate for a night with your lover.   That being said what you will eat and drink will be wellllll worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to Momocho on a Saturday night with my boyfriend, brother and sister-in-law.  I've been to momocho several times before and will keep going back because the food is so yummy.  However, what prevented us from having an amazing experience on Saturday was the service.   We got there around 8:30 with no reservation and was told it was about a 45 minute wait.  No problem we knew what we were getting into.  We found seats at the bar and ordered drinks and the gaucamole sampler.  I love the crab chipotle guac and the smoked trout one but the blue cheese one was a little too strong for me.   After about 20 minutes the awesome hostess came and told us a reservation didn't show up.  We were then sat and our real wait time began.  Our server wasn't exactly friendly or efficient but after about fifteen minutes she stopped by and took our food and drink orders.  Then we sat.  As the tables around us left and the place cleared out we sat.  And we sat.  And we sat. Our waitress repeatedly walked past our table without even a glance.  Our beer bottles emptied.  No reports as to what was happening with our food in the now nearly empty restaurant.  I finally looked at my watch.  10:45!  Finally my dish arrived.  I apologized to my tablemates and started eating.  I ordered the lamb which was cooked perfectly and served with a light and creamy mustard sauce.  The uncooked spinach wilted perfectly underneath the hot lamb mixing with a tangy vinegarette and pinenuts.  I loved it.  I also finished about 3/4 of it before everyone else got their food.   The food was still delicous.  The carnitas tender and the spiced chicken skewers  The best part of the night?  An order was sent back to the guacomole station pretty late into the night.  This was met with the cook yelling out some obscenities and stating he was not making anymore food.  Thank god that wasn't our order.  He was pretty scary. Of course I'll still go back but I might just call ahead with my order before I show up."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent but the guacamole was the highlight but I'm not sure if that's a good thing - that the guacamole appetizer sampler overshadows the main course. Pretty pricey too."}
{"text":"This place RULES.  Goat Cheese Guacamole was spectacular as was the Pineapple Guacamole.  Drinks were wonderful.  Wish the place was bigger.  Fantastic find!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. You must try the guacamole.  The atmosphere is cozy with fun decorative features. The staff is incredibly helpful with the menu and were easy to talk with.  Not especially child friendly but my youngest was thrilled with the quesadilla offering."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Guacamole trio appetizer was enough for two people to eat and not finish. Cucumber Margaritas are out of this world. Walked in on a Friday night when place was slammed and still got excellence service."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. There were a few people seated inside and outside but we quickly found seats at the bar. The bartender did a nice job of explaining highlights of the menu and recommended that we order our beer Michelada style. It was interesting, very spicy. I was looking for more of a refreshing drink, which it was not (just be warned, especially if you don't frequently eat spicy foods). We ordered grilled corn which was fabulous. Sad to hear that it was only on the seasonal menu, hoping to see it return next year. I hope to stop back in soon to try an entree and another drink choice."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour before the Yankees/Indians game. I had heard about the great deals for happy hour. I was glad to see 2 spots left at the bar for us to grab. We started with the house margaritas that were 5 dollars on special. They also had 2 dollar Tecates which i am a fan of but wanted to start out with the marg. We ordered two guacamole's, the smoked trout and bacon was awesome and such a unique flavor profile. I would have never thought that smoked fish would be good with guac but it was my favorite. The crab guacamole had a nice spice to it but was not as good as the trout. For dinner we had the half price taquitos, it was a nice hot skillet of carnitas with 2 salsas and tortillas to make your own taco. They were quite filling after our guac overload. I will be back for happy hour again and to feast on guacamole. Service was excellent through out the night. They gave us out of towners some good tips on things to do etc, they also kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been trying to get into this place for a whole year. I had planned to take him last year for his birthday, but when I called and tried to reserve a reservation, they told me they only took them for bigger parties, which is fine. However, when we went on Saturday-many parties of two had come in with a reservation and made their way to their table upstairs. Maybe I misunderstood-but I thought it odd that I had been trying to get into this place for a year and was surprised when we sat near the door on Saturday and I saw party after party come in with a reservation and be taken upstairs. When I had tried to get in without a reservation again later in the year, the hostess dismissed me again. Whatever, I just planned to get there exactly when the doors opened at 5:00 for the next attempt, so I couldn't possibly be dismissed. So that's what we did. Saturday, we planned to get there exactly at 5:00, which we almost did, got in around 5:15. When we came in, the hostess was filled with attitude, and it only got worse as the night went on, I only know because we sat directly next to the door where people were coming in. We told her we didn't have a reservation and immediately her demeanor changed towards us, like how dare we? Considering the last year I had been told that I wasn't allowed to make a reservation for just two people, I thought that her attitude was unnecessary, because obviously, if I would have known, I would have made one. There was one table for two left near the door, and we were told that was ok to sit at, so we did. The rest of the restaurant was jam-packed though. Only that one table was available when we arrived, meaning in 15 minutes, the place had been filled.  Other than the rude hostess turning away everyone that came without a reservation (the nerve of those people) our dinner was very flavorful. The guacamole (of course) was amazing. We got the sampler (3 different flavors) and I just enjoyed tasting the different kinds. Then we shared some taquitos, and I can't remember the name now, but I believe we ordered the carnitas, full of flavor!   Overall, good place to grab when your out in the city, but unfortunately, you would have to plan your dinner if you want to go here. Make a reservation-because apparently you can do that for all size parties...which is the opposite of what I was told....  Anyway-they really need to work on switching out their hostess, because she made the whole evening uncomfortable, honestly, and she needs to work on her people skills. The rest of the staff was so pleasant though! Our waitress was very attentive, and I heard the bartender conversing with everyone he was waiting on."}
{"text":"For the most part delicious and their margarita sampler is a great way to experience some of their unique offerings.  As an aside, when I asked my girlfriend if she was going to have the cuke margarita, she replied, \"Mmm...no.  Remember when we were in college and people used to wear cucumber scented body oil and everyone just walked around smelling like dirty salads?  It kind of ruined it for me.\"  Ha!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! We had to wait about an hour for a table, but it was well worth the wait. Our server was apologetic about the wait and was kind and attentive for the entirety of our visit. The food is great and the vibe is as well. Definitely a must visit."}
{"text":"Mod Mexican, I am impressed.  They redeveloped Mexican classics into creative dishes, and ended up being more authentic then 99% of the restaurants in the area. It was great to see a place be mod, but lose none of the integrity or flavor of what the dish is representing, Ok a little dizzy from all the circles.  When the first dish spins your sombrero around, you know you are in for something special.  The guacamole sauce is rich and smooth, but with enough chunk to give it a heaviness.  So the lifting of this dip will getting well on the way to being fit for your Lucha libre début.  my dinner was carnitas / adobo braised pork / honey-chipotle mojo.  The squares of pork fell apart with ease.  Creamy honey-chipotle sauce coating every bite.  Also the sauce was more about the taste then the fire.  Hey there's tortillas so I can have some guac on my meat also!  The decor of the place ties together 2 of my favorite Latin culture items.  Día de los Muertos and (big announcer voice here) el más fantásticos entretienen la atracción del mundo de la Lucha libre.  Thanks Momocho, and see you soon, Viva Mexico!"}
{"text":"Amazing favors. I got the brisket and my husband got the chicken skewers. We were blown away by the favors. I'm used to kind of bland, super fatty Tex-Mex, so I was definitely in for a surprise. We ordered the Gouda tamales on the side, and they did not disappoint! We had the goat cheese guac which was also good. I wish I'd tried other guacs though."}
{"text":"The food is decent for Cleveland.  Margaritas are delicious!!! The guacamole is to die for."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pork Belly Taquitos. The name is deceiving since it's not a what a taquito normally is. Nonetheless, it was very delicious. I especially enjoyed the pineapple salsa with the dish. The service was also great. Our waiter was friendly attentive. I would definitely come back again, and I would definitely order the Pork Belly Taquitos again."}
{"text":"Excellent guacamole with lots of variations. Best margaritas are the ones made on the spot. (Many are pre-made.) Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overall: Momocho has very tasty food and drinks, but it is way too expensive and did not have a vegetarian selection that was worthy of the price I paid.   I went out for dinner with my roommate first tried a cucumber margarita. Honestly, it was very refreshing and not overwhelmingly strong! However, it costs $8.50. I am vegetarian, so I ordered the Remolacha dish for dinner. It was also really good- especially the goat cheese and peanut combination since it is such an unusual combination. Despite the innovative nature of the dish, I did not think it was worth $12. The dish was too small and not filling enough.  This is a great place to visit if you just want to experiment with Mexican food. If getting your money's worth is something that really matters to you, this may not be the place to go."}
{"text":"First visit to Momocho was a success. We sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed our $5 margaritas and Hipsters (shot and a tecate). All of our food came out fast, looked and tasted great. The bartender was wonderful and answered all of our questions. The hot sauce was so good we purchased a bottle to go. Im not sure I could validate paying full price for their food very often, it's quite expensive, but will probably visit occasionally to relive the quality we had tonight."}
{"text":"Yum. Awesome margaritas and toquitos!"}
{"text":"The guacamole and margaritas are amazing and worth coming here just for them. They are the only thing I recommend getting, but they are worth it. Everything else we have tried (from a few trips) has been mediocre at best even when featuring ingredients we usually enjoy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, so this may be biased. The atmosphere is funky which is great. We sat in the bar area, our server was excellent. He was very attentive, personable and knowledgeable.  The food was excellent, I had beef tongue pastrami with a fried egg. It was excellent.  My wife ordered a chicken tamale, which she enjoyed a lot.   Overall a great dining experience, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Basically the chef is trying to reinvent the wheel and complicate things that does not need to get complicated.  This place came in highly recommended by co-workers and after reading the reviews here, I decided to give it a try. I have been to Mexico several times and have been to several Mexican restaurants in the US. This place is trying to reinvent the wheel. For starters, the prices are extremely high for what they offer and they are trying to make things too fancy and complicated when they don't need to be.  I have ordered the tacos al pastor. The dish came in with big chunks of pork, no cilantro, no raw onion. It looked like a stew and you still had to put them on the tortillas. The tortillas were very authentic, but I had to put an order for extra ones to finish the dish. The price was very high - $14 and I have had REAL AUTHENTIC tacos for way less than that."}
{"text":"i love mexican. i love mod mexican.  i love momocho during happy hour. otherwise, i think it is slightly over priced.  the margaritas are great. love the not so common flavors.  the guac delish. the entrees. eh, so/so. i was not blown away. i have tried different ones every time we have went and i just feel the same each time. my belly is full but just not overly thrilled or happy.  there is always a wait, so either get their really early or make a reservation. it's pretty small inside, so not a lot of mingling room. there is an upstairs area that we have sat at once and i felt like the service up there was not as good as downstairs......(maybe they forgot about us), i feel that the hype of momocho is higher than the food actually really is."}
{"text":"Definitely try the guacamole sampler. Get the one with the goat cheese. To die for..."}
{"text":"Great little place... Seem to fill up most of the restaurant with reservations which I am never a fan of but if the food wasn't so damn good, you would never know. Great service, food, and even with a bit of stress on fitting us in and getting us out to seat the committed table, they were extremely accomodating and friendly. We are going back for sure..."}
{"text":"The guacamole sampler and margarita sampler gets me every time!  So good you crave it!  Always make reservations though or you'll wait for awhile unless you can get a seat at the bar.  Well worth the wait though!  The goat cheese and spicy mango margarita are my top choice and always the first thing I order when I get there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you enjoy the not-so-commercial tequila, and guacamole, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went to Momocho one late tuesday night and the food was delightful. The guac with the goat cheese is fabulous. The staff was really helpful with helping us pick out the margaritas. My go-to margaritas are the pomegranate, cucumber, and grapefruit. The place is a bit pricey but definitely worth it, especially if you are a fan of modern mexican. The tacos were so damn good. They allow you to make them however you like with small soft taco shells. Definitely would like to head here again when I have the money. The  bar/booths are nicely dimmed and really create a good vibe."}
{"text":"Momocho's is everything but a typical \"Mexican\" restaurant as even indicated by it's slogan \"Mod Mex\". Tucked away in the outskirts of Cleveland in what looks to by an old house, Momocho's offers an unique menu and atmosphere.  We made a reservation for two on a Friday night and the lady asked if we wanted the chef's table. She explained and my wife and I went for it. To find out, you sit right next to the chef's preparing the food, which was a cool experience. It was, however, a small eating area, but we didn't care, we got freebies all night!  Guacamole is excellent, especially the smoked trout, but we tried all the other's as well and were equally good. Entree's were the ones featured on DDD and were as good as they look on TV.  Overall, a simply great experience. Whenever we are back to the Cleveland area we will be hitting up Momocho again."}
{"text":"It's ok.  Guacamole and chips were good. That's all. Good.  Shrimp tacos were tasty. Nothing special.  Tried the Gouda tamale dumplings which were the highlight of the meal. Again, they were good but not omg I need them now kind of good.  Wanted to like this place more based on the reviews but found it disappointing. On the upside, drinks were tasty!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for an appointment and decided to check this place out after seeing great reviews on Yelp for Mexican restaurants, plus it's Mexican Wrestler themed.  You read that right it's not a typo, Mexican Wrestler themed.   I was not disappointed at all.  If you are looking for TRUE Mexican, you may want to search elsewhere, what they have here is a fusion of Mexican with...well everything.  There are menu options for likely everyone in your party.       I got the Baggiga and my wife got the Machaca taquitios.   What you get is plenty of food for people to share for each order (approximately 5 small tacos each order).   I tried both and was very pleased in the options having a ton of great flavors in them.        The only thing I will ding them for is a limited beer selection.  Though the Mexican beer selection was nice, when you hit a trendy place I sometimes expect more."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We sat outside since it was quieter and a lot brighter. Our group started off with some guac- the goat cheese one. Now normally I'm not the biggest fan of goat cheese, but since the waitress said it was the most popular one, I decided to try it. It actually was pretty decent. We got to try the pineapple jicama guac later on with the entrees, and I must saw between the two, I prefer the pineapple jicama. I just like that extra crunch with the jicama in it. The only disappointing part was not being able to taste the pineapple. Don't be \"shiesty\" with the pineapple, peeps! The portions were good, but since I'm a guac lover I can never get enough. It was a good portion to be shared by 4-5 people.   For the main meal most of us ordered from the taquitos section. To me...it just seemed like a self-make taco style dish, not really taquitos since it's not fried? Anyway, for the meats we got:   machaca=I actually really like this one, marinated meat flavor was really good and super tender!! I used salsas from other dishes to compliment it.   bistec= Not bad, it was tender and seasoned well. I've tasted better though.  carnitas= The flavors were not bad...but my gosh, so much sauce! Whenever we took a bite of the taco, the sauce/oil would spew out the other end. Warning= make sure you have your plate ready to catch the sauce on the other end....and it's probably not advisable to wear anything white while eating this dish (unless you are a super careful eater?)  My friend also ordered the lobster/shrimp empanadas. Those were yummy! And the sauce wasn't too rich or heavy.   For dessert we ordered Mexican chocolate flan and the fried ice cream. The fried ice cream was huge! I liked the crunchy cornflake crust, and somehow the ice cream was not melting at all. I hate eating ice cream that's melted, so yay~the chef's did a good job. I couldn't even tell if the ice cream was really fried?! Hmmm...does that make it a little more healthy? lol- probably not...but a girl can dream, can't she? The chocolate flan was good, I liked the different spices they used. It has a heavier cinnamon flavor, than typical flan.   Overall it was a good dinner! I'm just a little disappointed with the prices. It's pretty pricey, but I'm guessing that's because of the location? I would come back here though...but only for special occasions."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town for a wedding and looking for something fun and exciting. We walked in, and the atmosphere was a very modern hipster atmosphere.  The orders the margarita sampler, salsa sampler, and tuna and duck tacos.  The favors were absolutely amazing, and best Mexican food we have had in a long time.  After having an explosion of flavor in my mouth, I was just craving more.  I could eat there night after night, and will be returning when I go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"AH-MAZ-ING. How did I go so long without eating here? Well this year for my birthday, I decided enough was enough so we went for dinner and margaritas- for happy hours of course because that's when everybody says to go. We didn't have much of a wait, which I'm told is unusual, but I guess going in the dead of winter is the key.   I'm not much of a margarita person, but these were so so good. The salsa and fresh chips were also a great start, but the real winner of the night were the brisket tacquitos. My mouth is now watering just thinking of these!! The are perfectly seasoned and served with their yummy guac, which was hard enough not to eat on its own. We also had the mahi mahi tacquitos, which were on the lighter side but also very good; the pineapple guac with these was a perfect addition.  Definitely one of my favorites here in Cleveland, and I can't wait to go back soon...although it'll be hard to stray from the brisket tacquitos again!"}
{"text":"Had a tasty dinner here last night. The server was quick (we were in a rush) and very helpful with recommendations. The drinks, trio of margaritas is a very generous portion, we're fresh and interesting. The food was unique and quite yummy. I would recommend this place to to anyone visiting Cleveland!  ***to the reviewer who gave this place a low star rating because it wasn't the kind of Mexican food he/she wanted at the price point he/she wanted: if you are on yelp writing a review AFTER going to a restaurant, maybe also use it to do research BEFORE you go. You are dragging down the rating of a really great place without having tasted the food. Also dim lighting is usually seen as romantic. :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I would give ten stars to if I could!!!!! I went here with a few girlfriends last weekend and we loved it!!  We did have a reservation because we know how ohio city can get at times! So no trouble there!  The atmosphere was hip, trendy mexican not cheap sombreros hanging from the ceiling. It was in an old house so it was charming (but drafty! Brrr!)  I tried the blood orange margarita and loved it!! I'm no tequila expert but they had quite an extensive list!!  We shared the goat cheese guacamole and it was outstanding. Truly very good and fresh tasting!  For dinner we shared the chicken tacos and the duck tacos. Yes, you have to build it yourself but seriously, stop being lazy because this food is amazing! The corn tortillas are perfectly done and everything was cooked to perfection.  I have to say, the star of the evening had to be the duck tacos... Assuming you like duck.. This was truly one of the best meals I've had in awhile.  Service was great too but the food was rave worthy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Had the Remolacha Taquitos (roasted beets and kale with spiced peanuts). Delicious!!!  We also tried the guacamole sampler and the smoked trout guacamole is to die for. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Momocho for quite a while. My recent Birthday was a perfect excuse...  We arrived early on a Saturday evening for dinner. The weather was still pleasant, so we chose to sit on the patio. During the quick walk though the dining room to get to the patio, I couldn't help but notice the eclectic decor which seemed to fit the \"mod-mex\" theme perfectly.   The patio was nice. Wrought Iron tables and chairs aligned the brick patio which was well landscaped. From the patio, it was hard to tell we were even in suburban Ohio City. It was private, quiet and secluded from the rest of the world.  To start off, we ordered the Guacamole with goat cheese, tomato, chile and poblano to nibble on. My beverage of choice was the Cucumber Margarita with red pepper lime salt. Both were very tasty. Especially the Cucumber Margarita! By far, the tastiest Tequila based cocktail I've ever sipped on. The flavors worked so well together.  For an appetizer, we shared the Grilled Corn on the Cob with chipotle + lime butter and cotija + pico. I have recently discovered \"Cuban Style Corn on the Cob\" and make it all the time at home. Momocho's version was mighty tasty too. My only complaint was that the kernels on the corn were a bit too well done for my likening. I prefer my corn more al-dente.   For the main course, I chose the Machaca Taquitos with coffee + ancho braised beef brisket and guacamole tradicional. I thought this dish was well seasoned with just the right amount of heat.   Overall, the Momocho experience was everything I had hoped. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We asked his opinion on a few menu items and he was well prepared to answer everything to our satisfaction. The atmosphere was relaxing and the food was excellent. There's so much more I'd like to try on this menu, so another visit in the near future is definitely in store.  In the meantime, I can't stop thinking about those Cucumber Margarita's! A mighty tasty beverage indeed!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Another great new find in Cleveland. We arrived on a Friday night near 8-9pm with no reservation and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. No biggie.   We did the margarita sampler (cucumber was so good!) and had the goat cheese guacamole. The margaritas were yummy. I'm not the biggest fan of goat cheese so I don't think I'll get that again, but I'd certainly try a different flavor. My husband had the tuna taquitos and I had the beef brisket taquitos. The tuna was alright, my husband and I both wouldn't recommend it, but the beef brisket was ah-mah-zing! We both LOVED it. Get it!! Oh, and don't forget the fried ice cream for dessert. I sound like a broken record but it was amazing! Get it!"}
{"text":"My go-to Mexican in Ohio City! They are on the more pricey, upscale side for Mexican, but they are worth it. We like to go on off-hours... around 9PM or later to avoid a crowd or a wait, as there usually is a bit of a wait.   Their menu is so expansive that we also try new things. I'm not a huge fan of guacamole (I know, pitiful), but their guac is delicious and I enjoy it thoroughly! I also love their sampler trays - for salsas, guac and even margarita. Their spicy mango margarita is KILLER and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   You really cant go wrong with any of their tacos - I love to get a few and share with a group so you can mix and match, but even if you order on your own you will be satisfied. Their crusted trout is also so amazing and melts in your mouth. Their short rib tamales are also a solid choice. Also, topping it off with their side of creamed corn is a great decision as well.   Wow, after writing this review, I need to go back. right. now."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Good drinks, but over priced and not spectacular. The tacos are kind of a mess, you have to make them yourself at the table, everything was cooked into the meat juices so there was no freshness, and the seasoning wasn't even that good.   I love Mexican food and drinks, I live 2 blocks from here, and I've been there once in 8 months. That about sums it up. I don't get the hype. Every other bar that has taco Tuesdays have better tacos. Go to barrios or deagans on a Tuesday instead"}
{"text":"We finally got to go to Momocho after months of wanting to try it out. We live in Akron and have two young children, so enjoying a kid-free dinner in Cleveland is a rarity. I'm so glad we chose to spend our cherished evening at Momocho!! We were lucky enough to sit at the chef's table and got to sample all kinds of deliciousness. I highly recommend the guacamole with blue cheese and the quesillo taquitos with paneer cheese. My husband loved the wild boar taquitos. The pimientos de padron (blistered shishito peppers) were amazing and the smoked Gouda dumplings were to die for! Margaritas were on point (my favorite was the pomegranate) and the atmosphere was casual and \"grown-up\". It really felt like a special evening and was well worth the wait for our table. (Be prepared to wait for a table of you go during a peak night. Order a margarita and go sit on the patio while you wait. You won't be sorry.) Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been back twice since the original review; this place is just fantastic. I highly, highly recommend the cucumber margarita if they have it. It's amazing. If they have the smoked gouda dumplings when you go, you MUST get them. They are cheesy, puffy clouds sent from heaven."}
{"text":"Let me start with the only negative about this place:  it's not very easy to get in. I actually didn't get to eat here until my third attempt.  It was worth the extra work!  This place is amazing! It is a very small dining room/bar but the atmosphere is outstanding.  It's more of an experience than it is just dinner.  Everyone talks about the guacamole and for good reason. We ordered the guacamole sampler and chose 3 of their unique guacs: 1) Smoked trout and bacon 2) Jicama and Pineapple and 3) Crab, corn and chipotle.  (Side note: pretty much every other table also had a sampler. It's that good!) I'm sure you can read a ton of reviews on the guacamole so let me talk about the food...  When we arrived we were told it was happy hour and the \"taquitos\" were half off.  We decided to just get 4 different orders of taquitos.  Oh my am I glad we did! We had duck, pork, boar and beef.  There are not a lot of places where you can get a selection like that!  All the meats were unbelievably savory.  Each meat came with a special homemade sauce which added even more flavor to an already spectacular dish.  I cannot write a review without mentioning the corn tortillas.  These tortillas are spot on to the tortillas I used to devour while living in Mexico. Great flavor and remarkably fresh.  They were the perfect compliment to the different meats and sauces.  Finally, I must mention the service.  The first impression is not the strongest due to rather unwelcoming hostesses.  However, our waiter quickly made us forget about the cold welcome.  He truly made this an experience for us. Friendly, engaging, informative and very attentive. I think he was waiting on every table in the restaurant but he never left us waiting and was on top of everything including refills.    I don't care how many times I have to try, I will definitely be going back to Momocho and you should too!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Not authentic (thank god). Fun atmosphere and great execution on the food. Salsas guacs variety inventive. All the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Driving by, saw it in passing. Amazing customer service & MAGNIFICENT food!! Creamed corn, pico de gallo (with chips), and smoked Gouda dumplings are a MUST try. My drink must've came from a golden dream because my gosh, the pineapple margarita is a god send. I recommend Cleveland get hip to this place. If not, suit yourself. More for me.  GO TO MOMOCHO!!!! They have the coolest and most helpful/thorough staff in the Land!"}
{"text":"Momocho has by far the best tacos I've had in Ohio since moving from Texas.   Make a reservation! It gets packed! Once we forgot to make a reservation but luckily we got there at 5 and the 1 table by the bar was open. It's really comfortable so try to sit there if you didn't make a reservation.   The servers are laid back and I really like that.   The food is amazing. Every item on the menu has its own unique flavor. Pricey but SO worth it. I recommend the pork belly tacos with a margarita sampler: hibiscus flower, cucumber & mango. Also, best salsa and guac. You really can't beat Momocho or El Carnicero. Both are owned by the same guy, who by the way will walk around and talk to you like he knows you. The whole vibe is awesome."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. Love the atmosphere and decor. Food and drinks are so good."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. The smoked trout and bacon guacamole was to DIE for. I sat at the chef's table with my boyfriend and had such a great time. Got to sample a few things off of the menu from our awesome chef/server. Definitely going back to try the short ribs and a hibiscus margarita (when they have times available haha) I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate here last year and it was awesome. This year I tried to make a reservation and was told it was first come first served. Well, we made the trip across town and were asked if we had a reservation... does that make sense to anyone?  Great food, but poor customer service. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"i never thought that one of my favorite mexican restaurants would be in OHIO. especially since i live in California, but momocho serves a \"modern\" version of the traditional cuisine that i have not yet tasted in SoCal. i've had something similar in NYC, but the flavors at momocho are a bit bolder. everything on the menu is FRESH which is part of the appeal.   the margaritas are TDF. they only use fresh juices and they are not overly sweet. i recommend the margarita tasting menu since they have so many fun flavors and they ALL taste good -- if i had to choose, my fav is the SPICY MANGO marg.   Guacamole -- fun and unique blends like goat cheese, crab, smoked trout, habanero, etc.   empanadas -- the crust is light and flaky (not dense like most empanadas) and they are filled with fresh seafood.   Tacos -- the meats are super tender and flavorful. all the meats it taste like they have been marinating and cooking for days... ones to try PRIME RIB, DUCK and PORK BELLY. the carnitas were good, but the other 3 had more rich / earthy flavor  Corn -- they also have the corn on the cob with cotija cheese, paprika and a creamy white dressing. it's a little on the sweet side (for me), but still very delicious.   Dessert -- i had high hopes for dessert, but thought it was okay. i tried their version of bread pudding. i would save my calories for the savory items.. but my friends did try the dessert empanadas and they thought it was heaven.   i'm definitely obsessed with this place, so much so that i'm trying to plan extra work trips to CLE just so i can eat at momocho again :)"}
{"text":"Definitely the best mexican place in the CLE, hands down.  Puts Lopez to shame.  We each got a margarita sample (specialized salted rim for each of them!) and the guacamole sample.  I highly recommend the cucumber margarita (so fresh), the pinnapple was fantastic too (understated in a good way- not too sweet); the mango margarita was a little thick to have a whole cup of though.  The smoked trout guac was divine.  However, for two people it was way too much guac (we took half of it home and it kept well for two days).   For a meal we split some slow roasted meat that had been rubbed in coffee grinds (or something of that nature).  Fantastic as well!  Definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Chicago and I was hard-pressed to find BAD Mexican food that was a stones throw away from my apartment. Here in CLE, it's been a struggle. I have to say after a year here Momocho gets it right...every time. If you haven't tried it yet, DO!"}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner on a Diner's Drive-In's and Dive (DDD) recommendation.  They were booked up, but indicated they would have tables set aside for walk-ins and that if we came during off-hours that we would be fine.  We had a group of four.  We showed up at 8pm per their recommendation and they said they wouldn't be able to seat us for another 1.5-2 hrs.  We lucked out and grabbed the corner of the bar after 15-20 minutes of standing around.  Margaritas were good, but I'm a bit of a tex-mex / mexican snob and didn't like to see that they were pre-mixed in gallon jugs  Guacamole sampler we got had two solid ones (blue cheese and crab) and one miss (pinneapple).  Entree's are all pseudo taco / fajita style.  Our group had carnitas, 2 hangar steaks and the tuna.  The steaks were above average.  Tuna wasn't a good fit for the fajita style set up.  Carnitas were probably some of the best I've ever had.  Atmosphere was cute / eclectic, but nothing that blew me away and a little too dark lighting-wise.  Price point was a bit much.  Average entree price was about $14 and (in my opinion) it should have been closer to $10.  Bottom line: I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Cleveland.  This spot is a better date-place than group-place."}
{"text":"Cucumber margarita.  Do I have your attention yet? Momocho is one of my top three, last meal on earth favorite restaurant type of places. Everything about this place from top to bottom seals the deal for me. Momocho is an intimate, 2-story mod-mex restaurant in Ohio City that has an amazing patio and unique lucha libre décor. Nothing else like this exists in the area.  But really, the food is just damn good. Everything is fresh, the portions are huge, and if you're on any type of diet, they are accommodating. I could live off their cucumber margarita, guacamole, and machaca. The machaca has super tender meat, and the flavors totally hit the spot. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever ordered something I didn't like. They also do margarita flights and guacamole samplers...if you can't make up your mind on their enticing menu. I totally standby that their cucumber margarita is one of the best drinks in Cleveland.  Momocho is great for everything: dinner with friends, a first date, or entertaining clients. They have a small parking lot, which is a gem in itself. Momocho has never failed me and has a little special place in my heart. If you're looking for a trendy atmosphere, amazing food and a place with character, Momocho won't fail you, either."}
{"text":"Hells and Yes. I really dig this place. While it wouldn't be my first choice for a night on the town, this is definitely the favorite place of multiple pals of mine, so I end up going here frequently. The vibe I get from it is \"upscale taqueria.\" Definitely get the guacamole sampler for your table -- you will not regret it. I got the little do-it-yourself fajita thingies (as you can tell, I am a Mexican food expert), and they were the most delicious things I have had all week. Service was fantastic. I was hungover so I unfortunately did not sample any of their margaritas, but my dining associates said they were great. I am lucky to live in a city with places this good."}
{"text":"They have some of the best salsa and everyone I was with loved their food. As the only vegetarian, there were only 2 menu options and the item I chose was super garlicky. Overall, I enjoyed it and I would try it again, but it might be a better fit for meat eaters."}
{"text":"Finally after months of waiting the hubby and I had a date night at Momocho.  We were able to sit upstairs at the chef table which was great.  The chefs were GREAT, explained it all and WOW are they busy back there.  I can't believe how small the kitchen is and all they do.  I had the scallops BEST EVER....the jalapeno cream corn was awesome.  Hubby had the wild boar which he thought was great.  Tried a couple quacs and quite a few margaritas.  Great atmosphere...great food...great time.  Can not wait to return."}
{"text":"We were traveling through the state and stopped here because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Just wanted a quick meal. I didn't realize it was Modmex until we got the menu. I was looking forward to some regular Mexican food. My husband had a margarita which was very good. Our meal was decent. I didn't love it. I paid $5 for their corn special which I think was outrageous. Our waitress was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Guacamole and margaritas are amazing!!! Very limited seating, but so worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"Larry and I are bidding farewell with a nice meal in West Side Market  in Cleveland...  Pretty chill spot  with random Lucha Libre photos all over the place...quite the site.  I get there not long before Larry but by the time he walks in I've downed two tecates and ordered an appetizer (guac with goat cheese....mmmtasty).  Larry saddles up next to me at the bar but later suggests us getting a table so we grab a booth and see the entire first floor...what a sight.  We notice this family of four (two young women, one older gentleman and a a rather frail older woman)  attempting to sit at a 4-set of two tops...  \"uhh those chairs are a bit high so you may not want to sit there\" is my thought   but, I keep sipping my tecate and  relax to enjoy the spectacle...  The younger two women try lifting the older women up onto the chair while the gentlemen (whom I'm assuming is grandpa) pretends to be oblivious while perusing the menu...what a jerk!  Fortunately, grandma didn't hurt herself...  Anyway Larry and I order the Duck and Wild Boar Taquitos...  The Boar was ok but the DUCK!!! Oh my god!  And get this,  it was happy hour so our food and drinks were half off!  We ate like kings for pennies...and it wasn't like we were eating at a dive.    Great spot, will go again...   REPEAL SB5!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.    It looks like it's trying too hard to be trendy. It's a bit far from downtown so you can try to walk, but you should take a 5 minute cab ride for convenience.  A few coworkers wanted to go for happy hour & dinner so we requested a reservation at 7:15 because that was their only availability. When we got there our table was already ready but we asked to sit at the bar for happy hour first since there were a few open seats for all of us to sit. So we started ordering drinks and we told the bartender that we may only want to order 1 drink while we waited for our reservation in which he told my coworker that he \"normally doesn't serve only 1 drink\". Kind of odd.   I ordered the traditional marg which was pretty standard. none of the margs come blended, fyi. I also ordered the wild boar taquitos which were good and flavorful. The strange thing is that the taquitos don't come wrapped... and the tortilla isn't fried. double weird.  I am not sure why they don't call them tacos at that point...   We also got the trio of guac. It was enough for the 6 of us and then some! we ordered the smoked trout (which tasted more like bacon than anything else), the crab/corn one which was sweet (to be anticipated), and the traditional which needed a little bit more lime.  All in all, a good experience, wouldn't seek to go back if/when I come back into town, but wouldn't turn it down if someone offered an invitation."}
{"text":"The food was not worth the trip... who deep fries Brussel sprouts and then toss them into a ton of vinegar? Disgusting! I guess it was my fault for trying to eat a little healthy at this place. I am not a fan of the style of Latin food that seems a bit of a stretch of modern Latin cuisine. The restaurant was extremely busy, which to my surprise my dish was not appealing. I order the trout with a mustard sauce and the trout was just bland. My side initially came with green  beans, but it was cooked in vinegar as well. I order the Brussel sprouts, which were horrible. Lesson Learned . . . Don't go back. It is ok, everything is not for everyone. However, this restaurant can learn how to cook Brussel sprouts from Parker's on E 9th."}
{"text":"I love Momocho. What a gem. And right here in Cleveland, too. So great.  You Should Order: -- Spicy Mango Margarita -- Smoked Trout Guacamole -- Wild Boar (Chancho) Taquitos  After dining at Momocho several times, I've tried all of their special margaritas. Spicy Mango is my favorite, but they are all delicious. Cucumber is great, and my friend loves the Hibiscus one. All of the guacamoles we have tried have been excellent too, and we normally get the three-guacamole sampler. I don't care for goat cheese, so I have never tried those ones. Our usual order is Smoke Trout, Crab, and Pineapple. All are amazing. As for taquitos, Wild Boar is the favorite because of the amazing sauce that comes with it, but I also love the Duck (Pato) taquitos. (I was super upset when they removed Duck from the menu a few months ago. Glad they brought it back.) Get a different taquito than your dining companion and then share.  They have happy hour on weekdays. The special margaritas aren't included in the deal, but it's also half off all taquitos so that more than makes up for it. Definitely makes this place a bit more affordable.  Also, make a reservation. You'll be glad you did. It's a small place, usually packed.   Literally the only complaint I have about this place is that they cannot accommodate groups larger than 6. It meant my Momocho-loving friend and I could not take our families there for graduation dinner.   Eat here!"}
{"text":"If you want a good Mod Mex night, go to Momocho. Hands down, this is the coolest and most drool worthy taqueria in the city. When I went with my dude, we put ourselves on a super long waiting list, and I was hangry to say the least. We walked around the neighborhood for approximately 10 minutes, came back, and the hostess ran out and told us they snagged a seat for us. I was beyond grateful.   We get in there, and the ambiance was so trendy. The bar is so lavish and cool, I didn't feel worthy to sit at it. We ordered the smoke trout guacamole, he ordered the beef tongue tacos, and I ordered the al pastor tacos. You can add an egg to any plate too, which is so convenient, because I love eggs on EVERYTHING. I wanted more after eating the entire meal, that's how great it was.   Momocho is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, hands down."}
{"text":"Tasty food and really great margaritas. Had chile relenos with AMAzing smokey sauce...had blood orange margarita that was one of the best margaritas I've ever had! Service is great, fast and very attentive even on a busy Friday night. Oh and the parking is free, even better. Decor is really cute znd feels cozy! Would highly recommend when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the service is poor; friendly but very slow. If you're deciding between hanger steak and brisket, go for the brisket. The portion is more generous and the meat is much more flavorful."}
{"text":"Awesome margarita samplers and some of the best guacamole in town, great bartenders. This place is legit. Negatives: Small and dark inside- parking can be tricky.  Overall great food and atmosphere, so Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"i love all kinds of mexican food and momocho was wonderful..  went a couple of weeks ago with one of my friends we sat in the very fun bar at a high top and had a great dinner.  we started with crab gauc and verde salsa.  i am always a sucker for green a salsa and this stuff was very good it had nice heat.  the main course where the true gem of the dinner i had the pork chop with black mole and tamales it was amazing.  i would of drank the mole with a straw my friend had the scallops they were amazing as well.  will for sure be spending alot of time here this winter when i move back to lakewood"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Momocho. I really did. But I thought it was just ok.   Service was slooow despite the fact that the restaurant seemed pretty empty. Our server gave my friend and I extra time to review the menu. Extra time we didn't need or ask for. (hello, internet menu) We attempted to order a guacamole trio, only to be talked out of it by our server. (\"that's too much food\") We shouldn't have listened to him. We like guac. And can eat a whole heck of a lot of it. One serving wasn't nearly enough for two guac lovers. Although the pineapple guac was \"just ok\" in my book, so maybe we were better off just getting one order?    I had the cucumber margarita that others have raved about. Was there tequila in there, because it didn't seem like it? And not in a \"woo, this boozy drink doesn't even taste like it has alcohol in it\" kind of way.   After waiting for an eternity and scraping every last bit of guac off the serving dish and eating nearly all of the chips that came with it, our meals arrived. My friend got the butternut squash empanadas. Just ok in her book. I got the artichoke heart and goat cheese tacos. Again, they were alright, but I wasn't \"wowed.\"   When the bill arrived, we were disappointed to learn that split checks aren't allowed. We were able to pay with two different credit cards, but I'm not sure why the check couldn't be split.   I'm glad I checked this place out, but I'm not sure I'll be in a hurry to go back. There has to be better guac somewhere in c-town..."}
{"text":"Absolutly excellent.   Had the braised beef taquitos for happy hour.   So much food I need help to finish and the best part $2 Tecate!"}
{"text":"This place was in a word, fantastic.  I had the sofrito green beans and the carnitas tacos.  Both were out of this world.  But what set this place above the rest was the chips and guac.  Not that they had them and that they were fantastic, which they were, by the way.  But what happened during our experience.   I met my brother and his girlfriend up there before meeting up a group of people for a party. While at the bar, I had some of their corn chips and guac.  Heavenly.  But when we got to the table, the server informed up they had run out of the corn chips but were hand making flour chips.  While they weren't the same as the corn chips they were still pretty good and way better than anything you'd get in store.  She also informed us, that due to the chip shortage they had actually closed early and that we were the last table of the night!  After hearing about our disappointment about the chips, the chef came out when our food came out and apologized about the shortage.  We was very sincere and it was great knowing that some chefs still care about the quality of product they put on the table.  It's that sort of attitude that'll keep me coming back, again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour and amazing service makes for one happy (repeat) customer.    I recently discovered I am lactose intolerant, as well as a celiac.  Being a vegetarian is already tough at a lot of restaurants...so this news was unwelcoming. Plates of bland, steamed, mushy and overpriced veggies and lettuce immediately flashed before my eyes. Ugh. Once I heard that Momocho has a gluten free menu, I knew I had to go ASAP. I've only been here once, obviously before all of my dietary restrictions. Momocho's gluten free menu exceeded my expectations, and didn't make me curse my intolerant stomach.  My fiance and I luckily got there right at 5pm when the doors opened. By 5:20 the first floor was packed...so if you're going for happy hour, make sure you get there early if possible. We took full advantage of the amazing happy hour and started with margaritas and pineapple-mint guacamole...YUM. Our amazing server alerted me about how the tortilla chips are fried in the same fryer as other wheat products and offered to bring me some steamed tortillas instead. The steamed tortillas were soft and warm...and surprisingly didn't make me miss the fried chips one bit.   He then told me that one of the components of the verduras taquitos I ordered had cream in it, and offered to switch it out with steamed rice. The taquitos were delicious...and with the 1/2off happy hour price tag, you'd be hard pressed to find a better tasting deal.    I am a server as well, and know that when you're busy, the last thing you want to deal with is someone with a mile-long list of dietary restrictions. Our server didn't show a hint of annoyance, nor did he make me feel like he was doing me a favor by having my dish modified. Excellent, excellent service. Definitely will be back whenever I have the chance!"}
{"text":"WOW.  Love this place after one visit.  Guacomole.  Yes, Yes, Yes.  Go for the sampler and try 3.  Goat cheese and smoked trout/bacon really worked well.  (Crab was a little too subtle for me, but others to try next time.  Poblano appetizer.  a meal in itself.  cheesy, gooey, good.  Taquito's for dinner.  I had Tuna.  the blood orange/jalepeno salsa was lick the bowl kind of stuff.  Nice tequila list."}
{"text":"Great place.. if you like spicy foods.  My girlfriend and I took awhile to make it here because we both have low spice tolerances.  But we finally decided on a Friday evening to check it out.  When we got there at 8 pm, we were told that there was a two hour wait for a table.  Okay, we'll make a reservation for Saturday.  Nope, no more reservations left for Saturday.  Wow...  Anyway, we came back next week reservation in hand.  The upstairs dining room is a lot quieter and more relaxed than the downstairs bar.    The smoked trout guacamole was good.  Nice and creamy, and we definitely got flavors of both the smoked trout and the bacon.  Also, the smoked gouda tamale dumplings were very good - tasted like gnocchi.    However, we wanted to order some taquitos too.  The pescado taquito (mahi mahi) - the server said, and I quote, \"oh no, that's not spicy at all!\"  The fish was too spicy for my girlfriend but I could stomach it only if I added a bunch of mild pineapple salsa.  The pescado pibil (pork) - the server said something along the lines of \"oh, if you're afraid of the spice, really, it just adds a little bit of tanginess.  And if it's really too spicy I can give you some sour cream to dilute it out.\"  I ended up eating about a third of it because it was way too spicy for both my girlfriend and me.  And seriously, who is going to dilute out the spiciness with sour cream?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I have yet to try something that I don't love. I've had nearly all the taquito's and they are all great. I wish they would bring back the Chikichanga, that was by far the best dish. The trout is also great. Their guacamole is a must, as is a margarita!"}
{"text":"Get the scallops! They're amazing. Cool place to try out in the area. I'm happy I did."}
{"text":"On Saturday, my fiancé, her best friend and I went to Momocho for dinner. We went to El Carnicero in Lakewood.  Both places are owns by Erick Williams, who was on GGG's and DDD's. He was the host and he sat us at Momocho, and is a really nice guy! The place is small so, make a reservation! The place is Mod-Mex and the food was outstanding! The drink list is huge and margaritas were really good. I would recommend this place, because it is locally owned and the owner makes you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night and took a chance with no reservation.   90 minute wait, but what the heck - we were there and reviews were good.  (their website does recommend reservations, to be fair).  We were able to stand by the bar and have some drinks while waiting.  Bartender was very good.   We tried all the different margaritas.   Big points off though for all the margaritas being pre-made and in plastic jugs!   This is a small place that is supposed to be higher end modern mexican food,  but you have pre-made margaritas?   I get the convenience, but really, how long does it take to make a margarita -- maybe 30 seconds?  Anyway,  they were good, but not great.  When we got to the table we were promptly greeted and appetizer order taken.   We got the guacamole sampler (traditional,  blue cheese and crab).   All were pretty tasty but sort of similar.    Neat idea though.  Around the table we had the brisket tamales (good);  brisket tortillas (very good);  wild boar tortillas (OK);  and pork belly tortillas (not good -- surprisingly deep fried?)  Waiter was pretty good and attentive.  Overall we enjoyed ourselves.   The atmosphere is nice,  not too loud so you can have a conversation, and people are pleasant.  I would give it 3.5 stars -- with a 4th star if they would just make the drinks fresh!"}
{"text":"Seems like there is always an hour+ wait. Not sure how this is a good thing besides having high demand. If you can't reach demand it reflects poorly. Food is great, but unfortunately Momocho does not want to spend money on expanding their restaurant area, which ultimately will result is lost potential revenue. But I understand they want to keep their illusion of an \"exclusive\" restaurant. Food is great. It sucks that I have to write a two star review about service because that's not fair. Please communicate better to your customers."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals, and delicious taquitos. A little pricey (hence the happy hour recommendation), and their margaritas are a little sweet. But their food (especially their guacamole) is spot-on, and you won't be disappointed with chips/guac, some wild boar taquitos and $2 Tecate. They also have a great tequila selection and bartenders who know how to recommend it."}
{"text":"Simply the best Mexican food you can get in Cleveland, in a super cozy atmosphere with great drinks and service. Pineapple margaritas are incredible. Make sure you show up early though."}
{"text":"Used to recommend Momocho to everyone who hadn't been yet but unfortunately that doesn't happen anymore. Booked a table for 5 for an 8:30 reservation. We were seated till 9:10 and at that point we told a friend who was waiting for us to finish dinner to just join us. We were shown a corner table that could easily fit 6 people and asked to add a chair. The hostess's attitude and response was shocking. She started by telling us we would have to wait till 10:30 to accommodate the extra person. Then she said 'I will talk to the manager' and disappeared for 10 minutes. Finally she came back the an extra chair and said 'she would ALLOW it this time but don't let it happen again' hahahaha are you kidding me?!  Allow it? When did this place become so pretentious ?!   Finally after my friend brought it to her attention how rude she was being she said that the extra chair at a CORNER table with no exit sign in site was a fire hazard and we could talk to the fire marshal if he decided to show up."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Momocho, especially during happy hour.  The tacos, which are usually between $10-$15 are around $7 during happy hour.  Their margaritas are excellent.  My personal favorite is the spicy mango.  I highly recommend the guacamole, the mahi taquitos, and the smoked gouda tamale dumplings.  Yum!    There's a small parking lot next door but it fills up quickly so get there early.  I also suggest making a reservation.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Walked out of downtown, across memorial bridge, and past a few projects to enjoy this place. It was worth the trip.  I came in on business this week and had a good time at the bar enjoying the addicting cucumber margaritas, i'd pay for that chili and lime salted rim mix. It's probably made on site though...Solid beer selection too, they carry Bohemia. That will always put a smile on my face, Joker Style!  Had the Chili Relleno for an app. The guajillo sauce and gouda cheese they use are top notch. I really like the breading they used, it created more of a crust than the sometimes sloppy wet paste you get around your Chili.   Boar Taquitos were great. I would certainly pay for their mustard crema they serve with it. Although i think i can manage to make that one on my own.   Cool place. Casual and fun service. Great atmosphere for any occasion ranging from drinks with a friend, first/100th date, or small party.   The low-rider bikes are a funny touch too."}
{"text":"the guacamole sampler was great but the rest of the meal was average at best. the taquitos listed on the menu - supposedly what they are known for - are actually soft tacos you put together yourself.  just thought i should mention that so you aren't surprised like i was.  worth a visit though...i got there late on a Wednesday, so it might have just been an off night."}
{"text":"Food: Creative and unique options for salsa and guacamole are by themselves great reasons to visit Momocho. With 5 or 6 types each, gotta do the samplers. Combinations of the salty cream goat cheese or the aromatic pecorino were nicely mixed with fluffy, creamy bowls of avocado. The assemble-your-own taquitos (not the  tex-mex rolled, deep-fried variety) were inconsistent among them (shrimp was a bit too saucy, tongue was chewier than even tongue should be). Beet and spinach was a flavor highlight with roasted beet and cheese and mixed well with the just-right moist taco-size corn tortillas and salsa verde (fresh bright herbs and a slight heat). Portion size overall was smaller than expected for the pricing. Think medium sized tapas plates.  Service/atmosphere: Service was great. We were seated early by very friendly, professional and thoughtful staff (from host, to bartender to table staff). Really a top service experience. The upstairs room is quieter, but at peak time still got louder for quiet conversation. Nothing unusual, but got a little hard to hear everyone at even a small table."}
{"text":"Outrageously good quac, a variety of puckerlicious margs, and a psychotic Mexicana wrestler decor distinguish Momocho as a candidate for best Mexican joint in CLE. The protein is succulent, if pricey. And the staff are all a bit on the sharp side, but ultimately warm when you get into their groove. Expect a wait, or better yet, make some way-ahead reservations. This is a Food Network-exposed taco den, and you'll understand why, but you'll want to try to prepare for it."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars but the service is not good at all.  Definitely a very hip artsy place with lots of 20 and 30 somethig year old folks.  Food is fairly creative and unconventional for its genre.  I had the mahi mahi (seasoned well but dry)  with white rice and black beans.  And though the food was decent, the only thing mexican is the beer and tequila.  Try it if you are looking to see a different side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I loved the decor, the service was fine. The food was just too fussy....the fish taquitos were kinda of tiny and overly stylized on the plate. I think I am going to vow to go back and give a 2nd chance. Anyways, I do have 6 more types of guac to try..."}
{"text":"Delicious, well thought-out food and excellent vibes and location. Not too much in the way of vegetarian options, though, so be warned!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My friends and I wanted to go for the happy hour tuesday - Friday from 5:00pm - 6:30pm. What we didn't know was that it was only available on the first floor and bar. Luckily we got there early and got seats at the bar! I would recommend you get there early, the place gets packed!   They have half priced tecate, traditional margaritas, and taquitos. I had the pescado taquito. The fish was cooked to perfection! This dish comes with guac as well. I didn't realize that until after I ordered the guac with sheeps milk Gouda. None the less it was one of the best guac and chips I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"First thing, you MUST make a reservation or good luck to you getting in.  Second, it is well worth it!  Some of the best guacomole I've ever had.  Get a sampler to share so you can try some that you would normally never try.  Go out on a limb, it won't break here!  The drinks were great (go for happy hour) and the food was just amazing.  I got one of their taquitos (bistec), but I highly recommend ordering their black beans on the side....I'm drooling right now thinking about it! :)"}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  Delicious tacos with good happy hour specials -- just don't stay too long...  FULL STORY:  Tried this place with a friend for post-work Friday happy hour.  Everything we tried was really tasty (and all new to me!).   It was busy, but not too packed around 6.  The taquitos are served like fajitas... a hot bowl with a base of peppers and onions with the other ingredients on top... and then some small corn tortillas. Loved the beet and spinach tacos with baked goat cheese and peppers.... very satisfying.  Really liked the ground pepita dip and the habeñero sauce with it!  (If you're a cilantro-hater, the dip has some in it but baaarely noticeable).    The HH menu is great (all the tacos, a couple marg options, + sangria), and they have HH at 5 - 6:30pm every weekday.  That said, I'd consider the regular-hours menu a little over-priced.   *** Our waiter was super friendly and great.  The only sour spot came a little after 7, when a hostess came up (without introducing herself) to say they had a reservation for our table at 7 (i.e., basically telling us to leave before the ink was dry on our bill....).   What's up with that!?  It's a smaller restaurant, but seems weird to have a reservation for a downstairs table within 30 min of 6:30... when people are likely to be there for HH.   Also wasn't sure why this anti-hospitality approach was taken instead of something like \"could we offer you a drink and seat you at the bar to accommodate a larger group?\"   Meh.    Note: Small parking lot to the L of the restaurant if you're facing it!  Also some street spots."}
{"text":"Came here saturday night after an indians game. No reservation and didnt realize you need one(our fault) as they had about a 90 minute wait but they were very open to letting us hover the bar until a seat opened up. To the point they told us where to hover as a couple just paid there check. And then after we sat came back to us about 10 minutes later came to us and said they had a table if we wanted it but we had settled into the bar nicely.  Food was super delicious. We shared the guac sampler getting the goat cheese, pineapple and crab to share(this was easily enough for 5 people, as we left with containers of guac at the end My fiance has the ahi tuna tacos and i had the duck tacos. The Ahi tuna was seared perfectly and had great flavor. I probably had close to .5 pound of duck on my plate, much more then i was expecting. My only flaw was i wish the taco shells were a bit bigger. But great food and great drinks as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and my wife loves Taco Bell, so what better way to attempt to eat at a place that should be interesting to both of us.  First thing...the service we received was perfect!  We were greeted by who we later figured to be the proprietor, who later delivered our bill and thanked us by first name.  We left there wondering how in the world he knew my first name...I'm guessing now it was from my credit card, but still a nice touch that wasn't necessary as they were busy.  The food and ambience was nice as we sat on the porch and enjoyed guacamole that was top flight and a lot of solid food.  My only knocks on the food, aside from the guacamole, was that it seemed a bit overly simplified and the portions were smallish by my wife's standards.  With that being said we would definitely come back and think that this place is and deserves all of its success."}
{"text":"Very nice find in Ohio City. Well seasoned food and attentive service. Nice atmosphere on a Sunday evening on the patio."}
{"text":"The food was well made, excellently prepared, but I dunno, smoked trout guac? Maybe I'm just too used to regular guacamole Don't get me wrong, it was very fresh and I loved the basic/traditional guac they had but fishy guacamole is too much for me. I know, call me a party pooper if you want.  I also had the camerones (shrimp), which was very flavorful and fresh I wouldn't really call this cuisine totally Mexican though, It's more like Nuevo Latino."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the guacamole: sheeps milk gouda, roasted garlic, ohio honey. one of the most unique and delicious guacamole dips I have ever had. the chips are made fresh to order and also order a side of pico de gallo. I ordered the margarita sampler and really liked the guava margarita- delicious and refreshing. (I could have gone without the strawberry mint or pineapple.)"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Cleveland area yet authentic Mexican street taco taste with a modern twist. You HAVE try the cucumber margaritas"}
{"text":"Momocho... Momocho, that \"Mod-Mex\" place in Ohio City. What the hell are we reviewing here? Placed loftily in the top five of Cleveland's restaurant recommendations, you would imagine that Momocho is an haute contender. But for every ten glowing reviews you page through on Yelp, you'll find one or two sobering souls that will put Momocho in it's place. These are the ones you want to read.  But all isn't lost for the Mod-Mex Momocho. I do have to say that reservations were very easy to make and grab, just be sure to do it early for special occasions or holidays. On a Friday or Saturday, you might scramble for parking as Momocho sits on a lonely quiet street without much commercial company. But whatever, you make it inside and you are overcome with trendy vibes and tones. The lighting is dim to dark and there is a heavy emphasis on warm colors. Which helps, especially when you're downing margaritas and making faces with your significant other (or significant other-to-be).  We were seated on the second level which seemed to be more like a dining area in comparison to downstairs bar-type atmosphere. Still dark up there, but I suppose that's what you can expect from Mod-Mex. Whatever that is. The wait staff was on point and definitely the highlight of my experience. Never hesitant to fulfill a request or clear out plates, that's service.  The food/drink breakdown went like this: Two margaritas (Cucumber, Blood Orange), Goat Cheese Guacamole, and the Remolacha. The cucumber margarita is excellent and definitely carries the distinct flavor on levels, include the chili flakes on the rim and you've got a great drink. The blood orange margarita was a typical fruity drink, fruity to the point where you might imagine they just added some fruit juice concentrate flavor to add exotic to the menu (this goes for the rest of the flavors). The goat cheese guac was great as well. The serving looks like roughly two cups of the guacamole and you get a nice basket of chips. This is really filling and you will definitely have to be careful to not overdo it before your entree. More on this.  The failing point was the remolacha. Beets and spinach far from roasted and lacking flavor all over. This was a worry of mine as I read the previous reviews, and unfortunately, they are right. The portion was small, and while it was in tapas form, it still left much to be desired. I can actually imagine how that dish was supposed to taste, and I wish I could go back and do it right myself. But restaurant reputations hardly get second chances in my book.  You'll find that the price point is bogus. Roughly $8+ for a slim, maybe 16oz margarita is a rip. The guacamole is a great selling point for Momocho and is definitely their flagship product. You can visit their website and see the menu's offerings but you will most likely stare at it for a few minutes and think, \"What are these things? Is this food?\" I'm sure the menu is derived from some authentic backgrounds and the names pay some homage, but no one really cares. The food has to be good.  So here is my advice. Get some good margaritas, cucumber, if that works for you. Get the guacamole sampler, it seems like the only thing on the menu that doesn't seem like a wash and you know it's going to hit the right spot. Finally, tell your friends that Momocho is not a magical place of contemporary Mexican cuisine, give them a realistic expectation. The plates are overpriced for exploration even if you go in with a primed palate. Then again, I guess they have to find some way to pay for all those boxes of avocados they must go through daily."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything you order here. If you are a taco fanatic, this is a must stop. I wish the place was bigger to accommodate more people. Usually we will try to go on a weeknight to guarantee a quick seat as opposed to the weekend."}
{"text":"If only I could pluck more stars from the heavens to award Momocho and their stellar chefs!  Speaking of the heavens, if there is guac in heaven it could not possibly be more ethereal than Momocho's.  We tried three varieties, one of which isn't even on the menu...you see, we were fortunate to be seated at the chef's table (!!!!!!!!!!).  When we asked the chefs (Damon and Tom, chefs extrordinaire) they told us their fave wasn't on the menu - for themselves, they whip up goat cheese, corn and BACON!  Then they favored us with that plus the blue crab, corn and chipotle and the pineapple, jicama, habanero and mint.  The crab and pineapple were really, really good, but the goat cheese and bacon....MMMMWWWAAAAAHHHH!  Oh wait!  I forgot about the cucumber margaritas!  Sigh.....maybe you should just order one yourself and experience it....words fail me.  Yum.  So the guac was only the beginning.  I ordered the machaca taquitos - brisket braised with coffee, ancho chilies and Lord only knows what other magic presented atop onions and peppers with emerald green salsa verde and more of that marvelous guac - this time the traditional.  Good thing I was sitting down because my knees buckled and little moans emitted as the first flavors hit my palate.  Do NOT miss the machaca!  Sofrito green beans!  Green beans raised to a new level!    But then again, there was the cube of Barriga pork belly - rubbed with spices and smoked to perfection that simply melted in my mouth.  Could there BE anything better?    My dining companion had the chicken tinga with smoked gouda tamale dumplings.  She, too, just kept making those nummy sounds.    Along the way, we were favored with samples of a few things going on behind the counter.  Spoonsful of rice pudding, a butternut squash and goat cheese empanada with Momocho's mole - mmmmmmmm.  And all the magic happens in a small galley kitchen just large enough for Damon and Tom to perform their culinary choreography to perfection.    Amazing night, amazing chefs, perfect evening.....no, wait.....heavenly evening.  Go."}
{"text":"Make a reservation.. like, 2-3 weeks in advance for a weekend. I called 1 week in advance, and didnt get a reservation.  Commenting on guac and drinks only, as we were at the bar and made reservations at another restaurant.  Got the cucumber margarita. It was good, but honestly, I was turned off by the fact that the drink came from a pre-made jug.   Goat cheese guac - huge serving of guac and chips, and while the chips were made fresh and very good, the guac was gross.  Trout guac - not a fan either.  Sorry, even though it seems to be super cool here, Im not coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in Cleveland. I have tried many different dishes offered and have never been disappointed. The guacamole is the perfect way to start any meal here along with one of their awesome margaritas.   The pork chop al carbon and the axiote sea scallops are phenomenal. I would highly reccommend either. The tinga and carnitas taquitos are also an excellent choice.   If you are looking for a great place in and around Cleveland, definitely make the trip to Momocho. It will be one of the best decisions you've made in awhile."}
{"text":"received an email from owner/mgr. apologizing for the terrible service. was offered free dinner to make-up for it, but i declined. i know somebody that worked there and they told me that it is policy to move the customers quickly, in & out, to turn tables fast. i won't be willing to give them a second chance, even for free. thanks, but no thanks! IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS, THEN THIS PLACE WOULD GET ZERO!!  this place is one of the WORST restaurants i've ever been to. i'd go to taco bell before this s-hole!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god Momocho!! I came here quite a while back, long before I was avid yelper. I just now thought of how I should definitely write a review, while I was stalking them on facebook.   There are no words to describe how much I miss you momocho! Sooo yummy, and fun.   I tried calling before we went, like I think even a day before but they were booked solid. I was told however that they would accept walk ins. So we showed up around 4:40pm after just arriving in Cleveland. Already there was a line forming outside the door 20 minutes before opening.  I was pumped to have gotten there so early and to not have to wait for a table. We sat downstairs at a table across from the bar, on some very high up stools. The place is pretty small and cozy. I loved the decorations all over the walls.  We started with the much beloved guacamole sampler. We got the goat cheese, blue cheese/garlic, and pineapple guacs! I love the creative ideas they have for their guacs. The goat cheese was definitely my favorite! The blue cheese was good but had a very strong flavor as you would imagine. The pineapple was also pretty good. The sizes of these things were ridiculous, and we ended up taking a large amount of them back and snacking on them at the hotel later in the evening.  For the meal I got the ahi tuna taquitos. I thought they were pretty decent. I wasn't the hugest fan, and I would prefer to get something more meaty next time since that seems to be their specialty. The blood orange marmalade that came with the tuna taquitos was stupendous however!! We were dipping everything into that by the end of the meal. My date got the coffee braised beef brisket taquitos and he said it was one of the best things he had ever had. You assemble the taquitos yourself, which I kind of enjoyed because I could decide how much I wanted loaded into each one.   I def wish I had tried the margarita sampler when I was there. All of them look spectacular.  I yearn for this restaurant everyday. I am constantly making excuses in my head for why I need to come back to Cleveland. I can't really find anything else I would want to do in Cleveland though haha. Some day though I will make my glorious return to the city and I will feast upon tons of meaty taquitos, conquer the rest of the guacamole I didn't get to try, and chug copious amounts of margaritas! And it will be legen  dary."}
{"text":"Never seen so many attractive girls in one restaurant in my life,  3 hot chicks left and 3 hotter chicks sat down in same seat,   Rediculously hot women everywhere in there !  the walls are cool with Nacho in his mask too!  LOL   the GUAC was awesome,  the Sampler of 3 GUAC is big enough for 6, we had 4 at table , but just letting you know, the wait staff won't help you to much , but were solid,  slow to bring out extra trips,  the meal I got was the Lobster, they could of not used this dirty looking watery green sauce in the dish and had way to many onions,   way to many !! and plenty of corn,   I don't care much for the shells of the Taquitos,  I never liked them,  but was a great Atmosphere A  + and the food was a C  so I give it a B !!   This is the place where chicks hang out and say Screw GUYS we are going to MOMOCHO  !!   Another plus no  KIDS"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour and was really pleased with my experience! Momocho has a great environment (it has a really modern feel though the restaurant is definitely on the darker side haha), and the employees who work here are incredibly friendly and helpful with the menu. I wasn't sure what taquitos were, but our server did a great job explaining these to us - basically, they give you your guacamole/meat with a side of soft corn tortillas and you build your own roll/taco things. I ended up getting the pescado taquitos. The mahi mahi was soft and cooked deliciously, and the pineapple guacamole made for a unique sweet and savory dish! I also had the margarita and sangria here, which were both sweet, tasty drinks. You can also pick the rim you want for your margarita - they have salt, sugar, vanilla salt, chili-lime salt, or you can also go without a rim.  Overall, I'm so happy to have discovered this place. It may be a bit out of the way for me, but I had a great time here, and I can see myself coming back here when I'm looking for some solid Mexican food! The deals are pretty great for happy hour, I would try to make it out during those hours if you can. Otherwise, I'm such an indecisive person, I definitely would like to come back and try their guacamole and margarita samplers in the future :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Came In around 8 pm on a Friday and immediately got a seat at the bar. Wait for a table was 45 mins but they serve full menu at the bar. I tried all the margaritas by ordering 3 margarita flights and the cucumber was definitely the best.  Goat cheese guacamole was on point. As far as meals go I tried the wild boar, duck, and braised beef taquitos. Contrary to the name they're served sort of fajita style. All were amazing. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. Service was great at the bar. Glad to finally have tried this place."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I always have the best experience and food!  There is always a wait even during the week, so make a reservation if you can.  They have so many different margarita flavors, but I'm more of a traditional girl and absolutely love their classic!  If you can make it there before Happy Hour ends at 6:30 you can get them half off!  Goat Cheese Guac is my favorite, and I tried the atun taquitos for the first time and really enjoyed them.  Can't wait to go back when I'm in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"Momocho is yet another fabulous restaurant  brought to you by chef Eric Williams.   I came there on a Saturday night with two friends and waited almost 2 hours for a table. We did not get seated until almost 8pm but we went and got a drink at another local restaurant so we were able to kill time while we waited. Once we were sat, we ordered margarita flights and the pecorino guacamole. All of our margaritas were delicious and we were all amazed about how the sweetness in the guacamole balanced really well with the salty chips.   Soon after digging in to our guacamole, we ordered our main entrees. Once of my friends ordered the brisket taquitos and my other friend ordered the vegetarian carrot taquitos. I ordered the roasted chicken quesadita with the beet pico de gallo. The flavors in all of our entrees were amazing. The beet pico de gallo was so delicious on top of the shredded chicken. The only thing I would like to note is the \"taquitos\" are basically do-it-yourself tacos, which is not what I think of when I see taquitos on a menu, nonetheless, my friends were still happy with their meals.   Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. The only downsides were the wait time and how cold/drafty the first floor is (we were very thankful to sit on the second floor)."}
{"text":"My only complaint is the food was so good, I ate so much that I was I overstuffed. My friend and I tried the guacamole sampler with the goat cheese, blue cheese, and pineapple guacs; all of which were delicious. Based on the recommendation of our server, I tried the Machaca taquito, which was so delicious my friend said she wished she ordered it too. She enjoyed the tuna taquito overall. The margaritas were strong, I wasn't a huge fan of the spicy mango margarita, but the standard golden margarita was great!  Excellent prices for happy hour, I believe it was half price gold margaritas and taquitos. The service was superior with the amount of business they had on a Tuesday evening, and we encountered a 45 minute wait, which we expected. Overall, delicious food and I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Took a friend for his birthday. The food was amazing, the drinks were fantastic - try the spicy margarita if nothing else. A little pricy but a great experience."}
{"text":"Momocho is the place for ModMex!  The chicken on the menu in so good & filling.  Guacamole is creamy & fresh!  Pineapple Margarita is the best I've had!  If you can order chicken quesadillas to go.  They're only on the kids menu but sometimes they'll let you order them.  Lucky we get to eat our kids if they share!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Get there early and sit downstairs for happy our specials."}
{"text":"This is likely the best \"Mexican\" place in Cleveland. Prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is cool. Service is good. Food is great. It is a modern style Mexican place."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Saw it on DDD and always wanted to check it out.  Got my wish after landing in Cleveland for work.  Very creative versions of Mexican food.  Ridiculous mole pork chop and the margaritas will get you ordering a cab home if you're not careful."}
{"text":"Atypical DDD but I swear Guy Fieri was one of those strange masked men in the pictures hanging on the wall. Arrived to be told it was a 30 minute wait but was seated after about 15. Opted for patio which provided lots of room in nice surroundings.   Started with a michelada ( beer and hot sauce wit some lime and salt on the rim). Well done and good price point and  I liked the ability to choose from any of the numerous Mexican and non-Mexican beers on the menu.   After mulling over the array of guacamole, I opted for the jicama/pineapple mix. Big portion, fresh and tasty but not as unique as I hoped.  Ordered the Machaca (brisket)  and atun (tuna) taquito plates at the recommendation of the waiter.  Both were cooked well. The highlights were definitely the  brisket filling (rich and complex)  and the blood orange marmalade that came with the tuna. The chile rajita was good but not spectacular.    Dessert was the Capirotada. Despite the unique menu description (gingersnap and jalapeno) and promise by the waiter, I would say it was an average bread pudding.   Decor inside was unique and very tasteful. Cozy in and out even though some of the art is a bit creepy!  Service was slow at times but the staff was pleasant.  All in all, a nice experience in a relaxed environment with refined, modern Mexican food.  Didn't blow my mind but I also didn't leave disappointed although I do believe,based on the pictures inside, I had a few nightmares of masked Mexican wrestlers administering full nelsons on me while screaming \"Mi comida es la mejor del mundo\" in my ear."}
{"text":"Tried the guacamole trio- blue cheese, pineapple and crab. It was interesting! Also had the steak taco and jalapeño gingerbread pudding. Trying out mexican food from pretty much all over the country, I will say their food tasted right, however, the prices could come down a bit."}
{"text":"I have to start off my review raving about the guacamole, it just can't wait. After ordering the smoked trout and bacon guacamole, I think I would've given Momocho 5 stars if they served me a soft taco from Taco Bell as my entree..the guac was that impressive!  The smoky flavor of the trout and bacon came through absolutely perfectly without overpowering the other flavors at all- I'm sure even the normal guacamole is incredible; whatever their base ingredient ratio is seems to be spot on for perfect, creamy guacamole with just the right amount of avocado to spiciness.   For my entree I ordered the shrimp taquitos which were very good but honestly completely overshadowed by the guacamole. The shrimp were cooked nearly perfectly and the garlic sauce was good- not great. The portion was also a little smaller than I'd like usually but after loading up on guac and pico de gallo (also very fresh and excellent tasting) it was just right. The service was superb, and I heard the margaritas were excellent as well."}
{"text":"First time trip to Cleveland - did my Yelp research and knew I had to stop in and try Momocho and I'm sure glad I did.  Very inventive food (taquitos - the chancho and pescado and quac with crab) and drink menu and the items we tried were well executed. I don't know if I'll be back to Cleveland any time soon - but if I am - I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"It was better the 1st Time I was there.  The food was o.k.,  the service was great.  Portions not the biggest but the atmosphere and setting were nice."}
{"text":"I been meaning to go to Momocho ever since I found out they had a goat cheese guac. Being that I loved both I figured it would be heaven in my mouth. So I went for Apps and drinks, on saturday. First impression awesome little spot, very clean, and I really like the decor. We sat at the bar and got the Guac sampler and Margarita sampler. Being a sampler you get a great size of everything. For Guac we got Goat cheese, bleu cheese, and a guac week special Garbanzo Bean and Feta Guac. By far some of the best guac I've ever had. The bleu cheese isn't my thing but whatever keeps my better half happy. The guac is very cream and tasteful, if you like goat cheese I highly recommend that. For the Margarita sampler, we got grapefruit, blood orange, and spicy mango. The drinks were great tasting, not overly strong, and flavorful. Out of those I think my favorite was the blood orange. I wouldn't get spicy mango next time but again my partners choice. The mango flavor was good but the spicy I wasn't a fan of. Overall a great little place. Only thing is it's a little pricey for other places I been to in Cleveland. The 2 samplers ran me about 40. The staff is really nice."}
{"text":"I am very fussy about my Mexican....having lived in Chicago for 25 years I can attest that yes, thre are lots of grrrreat ethnic places, joints and otherwise...but Momocho was supurb...Eric, owner and chef actually called me on my cell while our family was enroute from Buffalo New York...he had heard that we were a party of seven..three children and that we could only get a 9:30 rez...he switched things around for us and gave us a great table at 7:30!!!  He spent lots of time with us...and we even talked about opening a place like his in Buffalo!!!  The duck and boar were very well prepared and very well received!!!  My 9 yr. old neice had the boar..my daughter loved the calamari and my son almost inhaled the hanger steak...chips and salsa...basic stuff were so fresh and just right....Eric...let's talk!!!  We need a Momocho in Buffalo!!!!"}
{"text":"Would recommend getting a michelada style beer, it's like a beer bloody mary."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with the food or the prices. I was, however, VERY impressed with our server. He was attentive, comedic, knowledgeable, and overall just a pleasure to be around even though the place was packed. He talked me in to trying the goat cheese guacamole here which is said to be phenomenal. I will admit that even though I am not usually a fan of guac, this was pretty darn good. It had more flavor than I've been accustomed to and it was a nice surprise. I also started with a pineapple margarita which was refreshing although I wish there had been a bit more pineapple flavor to it.   Unfortunately after all the chips and guac we had, our stomachs had little room for our actual dinner. I ordered the smoked trout and crab chilaquiles which was a layered dish and good overall. It did not re-heat well after having to take 3/4 of it home. I realize seafood doesn't re-heat well to begin with, but I would have liked to be able to finish the dish. Especially considering the price. My boyfriend had the Tinga and seemed to enjoy it. I'm surprised he managed to eat it all but he's always been a big eater. He LOVED the sauces it came with. They were sweet, spicy, and delicious.  The food was good, yes, but I guess with all the hype around this place I was expecting a little more. Three stars for everything except our server, he earns this establishment a four."}
{"text":"Absolutely love momocho!  Let me begin by saying no one makes a better margarita and arrive during happy hour and get one or three for $5, enough said! But listen don't let the delicious traditional margarita be your only one. Try one of their amazing flavors like blood orange, or pomegranate or my husbands favorite cucumber. Can't decide Try a flight for a great sampler.  My starter go to's are usually the guacamole.. goat cheese is my favorite. But the black pepper pecorino was amazing. Queso Fundito is amazing too.  For my meals my favorite is usually the machaca or carnitas taquitos. The fresh corn tortillas are delicious making even this flour tortilla lover a fan. But on this visit I tried something new and was impressed as always. Filled with a beef piccadillo and battered in a delicious cornmeal tempora. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and have never had a bad experience. The first time I went, I got the tinga taquito, which is chicken. It was good, but I didn't think it was absolutely something to rave about. My boyfriend let me try his dish, the machaca, and I almost died when I ate it--it was that good. The flavors just pop out and I love it so much so I always get it every time I go there, even though my boyfriend tells me to try something new.  If you are going to be ordering taquitos, I would only go during happy hour (5-6:30 weekdays only), especially if you look at the menu ahead of time and know that's what you will be getting. Taquitos are half off, and classic margartias (no other flavors) are half off also (regular price is $8). Otherwise, I really believe it is too expensive. Happy hour is for the first floor only, and if you want a table you HAVE TO MAKE A RESERVATION **WAY** IN ADVANCE. If you want to go on a Friday night and call them the Tuesday before, it's not gonna happen. Keep in mind the restaurant is closed on Mondays. It doesn't open until 5 Tuesday-Saturday, and they open at 4 on Sundays.  If you don't make a reservation, you can try to get a seat at the bar, but you literally have to be there 15-20 minutes before they open and wait outside to get a seat. It's so hard to get a reservation because the place is small, plus reservations are made based on a two hour dining experience. You can't make a reservation for more than 6, at least for the first floor.  The have a margarita sampler, where you get 3 half glasses of margartias, so you can try a couple flavors. The sampler runs you $15. The cucumber margartia is very, very refreshing. I also like the blood orange one, and the spicy mango isn't bad. The last time I went, I got a red bell pepper margarita, and it really did taste like one, but I don't like to drink peppers so I didn't care for it, plus it was a little spicy.  The only thing I would say I don't really care for is that you are charged for items such as chips, but it's only $2 for the basket--if that makes or breaks you, I don't think you will care much for the restaurant. I typically get the pico with the chips for an appetizer, which is usually good--the last time I went, it didn't have as much flavor as it usually does. My boyfriend loves their guac, but I always stop him from getting it as an appetizer because the machaca that I always get comes with it, and it won't all get eaten.  I would only get it if we are there with a big group and everyone will be eating it.  Lastly, the service---everytime I go there and sit at the bar, it's the same guy with thick framed glasses, and he is very good. He's nice and extrememly knowledgeable about the food and drinks. It seems that all the males here are very nice, I don't care for any of the female hostesses/servers--their customer service is so-so, and they don't really do anything to go above and beyond, even when it comes to saying nice, simple \"hello\" when you walk in.  The owner also did all the artwork on the walls---so awesome!  I recommend this place to EVERYONE who is from out of town and is looking for something completely new and unique. Definitely not your traditional mexican restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Think it should be good. Food is average and service is pretty bad! The waitress even forget our orders and did not return credit card. Do they wanna charge some secret fees? OMG! Not worth for a 4 star. The beef is over baked. So disappointed...."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with an inventive menu compared to your typical run of the mill Americanized Mexican restaurant. This is anything but typical or run of the mill. Guacamole and salsa choices are extensive and worth trying a variety of either, or both. Chicken tamale with green sauce was outstanding. Food tastes fresh and flavorful. Lots of tequilas and margaritas to choose from too. Fun, slightly funky atmosphere on either of the 2 levels or outside on the patio. Watch that steep climb to the second floor!"}
{"text":"Loved everything I tried especially the guacamole with goat cheese. I used the CLEseats app and tried the Margarita flight for $10. Loved it!!! Best Margarita's in town. Menu is very modern and fun to check out. Ingredients were very fresh. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Their guacamole is delicious, and the Caulifour with curry sauce is my favorite. This spot is the only place I look forward to eating at in Cleveland. Only downside is the size of the restaurant and that it is very hard for them to accommodate a larger group of 5 or more. Recommend a reservation"}
{"text":"I literally got into an Uber and told the driver to take me to a kick-ass place for dinner. He suggested Momocho's and touted their impressive Mexi-fare menu. The food -- impressive. Eight wildly different kinds of guacamole from which to choose ... plus, an inspired menu of both Tex and Mex. The venue -- darkened. It was like dining in a delightfully decorated underground lair. The service -- haphazard. When I sat down two people jumped to take my order, but as it turned out neither was my server. That honor went to the bartender -- uh, because I sat at the bar. He seemed a bit frazzled/discombobulated while I was there. Shame ... because the rest of the staff was hyper-friendly -- including an oh-so chatty bus boy who was admittedly hopped up on caffeine. I was in and out in twenty minutes -- even though my entree came out before my appetizer. (The flummoxed bartender took it off my bill. Props.) Be sure to rock the guac while you're there -- it's a highlight. The drink menu and dessert menu looked fun too."}
{"text":"if you don't know what good mexican food is then i can understand why you would like this place. needless to say, i'm almost kind of embarrassed for people who love this place so much.   the food here is so ridiculously underwhelming. guac platter, my god. why would you pay to have 3 different \"versions\" of guac that all taste the same. the salsa, may as well have ordered tomato water.   i took my parents here with my fiancé and like many of my reviews for cleveland lately, maybe living in nyc has set high standards for food... which makes me feel like a douche. however, this food is just terrible.   if you don't care about quality, taste or hospitality then this is for you. i'll start off with what we ordered for our entrees; i had the pork belly, my mom had the brisket, my dad had the chicken and my fiancé had the wild boar. sounds great right? wrong. upon getting our entrees, a complete airhead waitress whom we weren't familiar with told us \"HAHA so and so dropped your chicken plate\" to which i was not as amused as she thought we would be. no apology no nothing. like listen sweets, you aren't a comedian, you're a waitress. no one here finds you funny, we want our food, not your \"jokes\". so while you're laughing at my fathers dinner falling on the ground, he had to wait 10 minutes for it to even come out, making all of our food cold because like well mannered humans, we didn't start without him. once the chicken did come, i had tasted my pork belly and hated it so my dad switched with me because he would eat a shoelace if it was covered in garlic.   boar: tasted like someone sautéed wild boar in folgers coffee chicken: burnt and wet.  brisket: tasted like a dessert pork belly: the 4 pieces of pork belly tasted like vomit while the pork rinds tasted like carpeting.  sofritos green beans: why are you drowning perfect green beans in horrible tasteless sauce? grill them with salt and lime. it's that easy  margarita sampler: this is by far the best thing they have and even this wasn't that good. talk about going heavy on the margarita mix.. i couldn't even tell which flavor was which.   the decor: too dark. the inside smells and looks like an asian restaurant...? terrible bathroom locations, however they were both clean. why are there 10 different chairs? the carpeting on the floor upstairs makes you feel like you're at a chain restaurant. the only reason we brought our (huge amount) of leftovers home was to give them to homeless people by our apartment.   I am so disappointed in this place. I had it bookmarked for about 3 weeks and couldn't wait to take my fiancé and parents here based on the reviews. I cannot believe this place has 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Never thought I would find such a gem in Cleveland Ohio. Starting with the guac trio and margaritas to the pork chicken and shrimp entrees our table enjoyed. They house make the hot sauce with a carrot base which is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour--- one of the few restaurants that has a parking lot in tremont, although with limited spaces. Their margaritas are what draw me in. Their menu is only mediocre."}
{"text":"I love this place. The flavors are incredible. They make a great mole sauce. Great tamales and the sides are delicious. You can't find a better Hispanic place in CLE"}
{"text":"==The Bad== The margaritas had this vintage pressed fruit juice taste to it. We had the sampler and were batting 0 for three with this stuff.  ==The Great== Guacamole - Goat Cheese The goat cheese perfectly complements the fresh guacamole. It looked mouth watering when it was presented to the couple four seats down the bar. The cheese is mixed in the guac and is extremely satisfying once it's uncovered.  Pork Chop al Carbon Was served like a one inch thick steak. It was delightly moist and tasted well seasoned. We got full off the goat cheese guacamole and queso so we took this to go.   ==Quirky Stuff== -Wait times for walk-ins is generally 90 minutes during dinner. To shorten the time, have you and your date spread out behind the customers at the bar. There's bound to be a blind date gone bad for you two to swipe some seats. -Would have given five stars but the margaritas tasted stale and did not complement the food."}
{"text":"Make reservations and prepare to have an amaaaaazing meal. It's definitely a place to experience out of this world spicy margaritas and sexy lighting. Fantastic for a date night."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, all the food we ordered was delicious. Absolutely no complaints in the food department however our overall dining experience took almost 3 1/2 hours. We waited 45 minutes to be sat at the bar. We were so famished and (we don't recommend coming here if you need immediate nourishment) after ordering an appetizer we were moved to a table where we didn't get to order our meal for another half an hour. After ordering we didn't get our food for another 50 minutes. When our food came out we didn't have enough tortillas for the both of us but we didn't want to ask for more because our waiter was already doing the work of 3 waiters. I felt bad and feel bad for leaving two stars but these guys gotta hire some more people."}
{"text":"Food was quite good.  Service could be a lot better.  They charge extra for nacho refills (the server didn't disclose this when she offered to refill the basket).  My entre arrived almost ten minutes after my friends' entrees without any explanation or apology for the delay.     Chipotle costs a lot less and has friendlier and more efficient service."}
{"text":"Last night was our 2nd trip to Momocho and we had delightful visits here both times. We were seated in the bar area last night and it was Happy Hour! The house margarita was incredibly delish & it was $4! The taquitos were also 1/2 off. We smiled a whole lot last night!!!  We started with one of their incredible guacamoles. We had sampled several on our last visit and decided to go with the jicama, pineapple, habanero & mint this time. Spicy & loaded with flavor. I laughed when my husband said he found it too sweet - honey, there is fresh pineapple in there - if it wasn't a little sweet, I'd be worried! It had enough heat to keep him happy & I noticed he cleaned the bowl. Their fresh made chips are stellar!  We ended up ordering 3 varieties of the taquitos - carnitas (red chili adobo braised pork), machaca (coffee & chili ancho braised beef brisket) and chancho (adobo braised wild boar). All were served with mini corn tortillas and 2 different sauces for you to assemble at the table. The best of those sauces was the honey-chili chipotle mojo that came with the carnitas. We both couldn't get enough of this delightful sauce & literally used it on everything - nothing short of SPECTACULAR!!! Our server told us if we call 2 days in advance we could get a bottle of it!   Great service, delicious margaritas, inventive guacamole & a plethora of delicious, expertly prepared taquitos - recipe for a very happy evening!!!!"}
{"text":"The margarita flights are definitely the highlight of this restaurant. I feel that this place is best to grab a drink during Happy Hour and get some guacamole. The entrees here have never totally done it for me."}
{"text":"We probably have tried all of the guac flavors by now. All of them were tasty and unique in their own way. My favorite was the crab meat and roasted garlic. You can clearly taste the crab meat, but not over powering. They used to have a roasted garlic, honey with goat cheese and that was very delicious as well. For the main courses, I love the short ribs tamale and the lamb shank. The lamb was literally falling off the bone. Very delicious!!! However, the wait was very long (about 90 min) and that seems to be typical for all of the times I have visited."}
{"text":"I Loved this place!  I was in Cleveland for work and my boyfriend came to visit.  On the plane ride over the kind woman next to him recommended this gem of a restaurant.  When we arrived at the address I was kind of worried because the street itself didn't seem very welcoming.  Once we got closer to the building, you could tell there was something special inside this place.  We walked in unaware that we should have a reservation...the place was packed!  Fortunately for us the gentleman taking names pulled us aside and asked if we thought we could eat within an hour and a half.  We said why not?  And he said okay I can get you in right now!  We were taken upstairs to a Lucha Libre themed room.  Everything we had was amazing!  The drinks, guac (so many to choose from!), the dinner, the dessert!  Our waiter made such good recommendations and didn't rush us at all (even though we were running on a deadline).  Next time I'm in Cleveland you can bet I will be back...with a reservation this time ;)"}
{"text":"OMG!  Can't wait to go back to Cleveland for more!  Please open a Pittsburgh location!  I know, too many exclamation points, but I can't help myself!!!  Have some guac, please.  We had the goat cheese and it was so good.  The spicy mango margarita will put hair on your chest, it's so spicy - yum!  Next time, I'll do the margarita sampler.  Short rib tamales and the pork chop were TDF.  We also had a side of the smoked gouda tamale balls and the esquites.  The bread pudding dessert was kinda meh, but we still ate it, so how bad could it have been, right?  Lots of leftovers made a fantastic second meal last night."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! Our waiter was incredibly funny and knowledgeable and chatted amiably with us when he found out we were from Michigan.   The margarita flight is a must try if you like margaritas. The best one I tried was the mango with a spicy salt rim. My second favorite was the blood orange with a salt rim and my least favorite (although it was still awesome) was the pomegranate with a sugar rim. We also had the trio of guacamoles, and they were all good--pineapple, smoked trout, and goat cheese. I loved the blistered shishito peppers--I could eat them all day every day! They were great in the tacos as well. Three of us got tacos, and I got the beef short rib tamales, which were kind of like a deconstructed tamale, with the short rib meat on top of the corn masa. All of it was delicious! For dessert, we got the vanilla bean flan, which was very smooth and full of real vanilla bean specks, but I'm not sure that I'd get it again (just personal preference).   Making reservations was a breeze, and I appreciated the reminder phone call the day of our reservation. I'd come back again when I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"What a gem. I've been to this Ohio City joint a number of times and it never fails to disappoint.   By far, my favorite thing to order is the guacamole sampler. The flavors are so damn tasty and unique. GOAT CHEESE GUACAMOLE? UM, YES PLEASE. Basically a combination of my two favorite foods. It tastes like heaven.   Margaritas here are also very tasty--I've had the cucumber and hibiscus margaritas, both incredibly refreshing and yummy!  As far as entrees go, I had some vegetarian fajita dish. The only downside is that I wish the menu had more vegetarian options. But honestly, I still have a wonderful meal every time I come here.  Mo' momocho please."}
{"text":"Forget everything you know about Mexican food. This is the best in CLE, no debate. As evidenced by the line forming outside the door until it opened promptly at 5pm. We had made a reservation and were quickly seated upstairs. It is a small house but we were never rushed despite the demand for seating. As the menu said, it is a two hour dining experience. The decorating is fun, pictures of masked Mexican wrestlers everywhere. My wife and I both tried margarita flights, six different flavors. Our favorites were the spicy mango with chili lime salt and the cucumber. The salsa and guacamole choices were also impressive. We were almost full before the entrees had even arrived. But that didn't stop us from enjoying them very much. I had the braised lamb shank with mole. My wife had the seafood chilaquiles. Both dishes expertly prepared and seasoned. The service was phenomenal, our server, Damian, was able to explain the menu in great detail and reminded me of service we've had at the more traditional fine dining establishments, of which Momocho should be considered."}
{"text":"Momocho is definately not your average Mexican restaurant. We started off with a salsa sampler and the bacon, smoked trout, and poblano guacamole. Didn't really care for the sikil pak, but loved the Pico and the pina. The guac was good, but after watching DDD was expecting chunks of the smoked trout, so although it was good I was a little disappointed. I had the Machaca which was good and my niece had the Tingo which was pretty much the bomb. If I return it will be the barriga, camarones, or the albondigas (I went tame for my niece) along with a reservation (we ended up at the bar after walking in and there was a line forming 10 minutes before the door opened) to see if we can't take this thing to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Real time review right here! As I sit here belly up at the bar, a relief washes over me in an awesome wave. As with other long standing establishments in Ohio City, I appreciate the fact that Momocho maintains its \"small restaurant...small tables\" mantra. Yes the food is good and the guacamole is ridiculously flavorful (goat cheese...phenomenal) but the atmosphere is what is remembered. The hipster luchador vibe is too cool. You're a  a cool kid the moment you walk in. Strike up a conversation with another patron, one of the many friendly bartenders/servers and even your own friends! Get in here for Happy Hour + 1/2 if you can...cheap drinks and half price taquitos!    ¡Salud!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit to Momocho. Overall, the modern Mexican (mod-mex) food was well prepared from quality ingredients, offered in some interestingly memorable ways, offered a decent value for the money and a cool vibe. We can't wait to go back.  On a whim, my wife and I visited on a Friday night around 7pm. The small restaurant was busy and the hostess indicated a 45 min wait. Within a few minutes we were able to snag a single seat at the bar and order drinks. She had a very good Cucumber Margarita ($7) and I had a Mexican bottled beer ($4.50). I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have beer on tap, nor did they carry local microbrews.   Within about 20 min of putting our name in our hostess let us know that a table had just opened up on their patio. This was a perfect night for it, so we jumped at the chance. The dining room was very well decorated and the vibe was fun, but seating was very limited. The patio was classy and private, with plenty of room between tables too.  We started with an order of their fresh Traditional Guacamole ($8) which was good but nothing special, and came with an order of disappointing chips that might have been store bought. They listed several unique flavors of guac on the menu, including a blue cheese version.   For dinner we split two hearty small plates: an order of butternut squash empanadas with a chocolate mole sauce and a chorizo bake with tortilla (about $17 for both). The emanadas were amazing - hearty, fresh, perfectly prepared. The sausage was ground with melted cheese on top, a portion so large we had to order a second helping of their warm 6\" corn tortillas.   Our waitress was casual and friendly and gave her suggestions on dishes when asked, but she was a bit slow to check back in, but just fine overall. The food came out of the kitchen warm and arrived in time, not too quickly or to slowly.  These two small plates, combined with the guac/chips and drinks was more than enough to satisfy our appetites. For about $40 we had dinner, drinks AND tip in a cool, hip atmosphere, well worth it. We can't wait to go back with a few friends."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Friday night without a reservation, so we weren't surprised when we were told there would be a long wait for a table.  However, when we called earlier in the day, we were told the patio was first come, first served, which turned out to be incorrect.  (Only the back bar/patio - with no tables for eating - is open seating).  Fortunately, we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes for seats at the bar to enjoy our appetizers and drinks.  We tried the guacamole sampler with the tradicional, the goat cheese/tomato/chile poblano, and the gouda/garlic/honey guacs.   Was not a fan of the goat cheese one, but the tradicional was fantastic, and the gouda/garlic/honey guacamole was unique (in a good way!) and was so good that I couldn't stop eating it.   Mid-way through our appetizers, we added some pico de gallo which made the tradicional just that much better.  And the margaritas?  The strawberry mint margarita was the best margarita I've ever had.   Our service at the bar was really good, too, despite how clearly busy they were.  The downside of the AMAZING margaritas and delicious guacamole is that neither my bro or I were able to consider eating an entree.  I had just moved from California, to say I was skeptical that there would be good Mexican food in Ohio was an understatement.  I was quite impressed, and I will definitely be back on my next trip to Cleveland, with a reservation next time...."}
{"text":"a friend and i had dinner at momocho last night before hitting the house of blues for a show. he made the reservations a couple of weeks in advance and they were packed! they warn you when making a reservation (and it's printed on the menu) that the reservations are based on a \"two hour dining experience.\" we were there for about an hour a 45 minutes.   i liked that we weren't rushed at all and i enjoyed taking our time with the meal. the awesome food was certainly a bonus too!  we started out with the blue cheese and garlic confit guacamole and the spicy salsa verde with chips. both were very tasty.  my friend had the mole pork chop and he wouldn't even share a bite! he said it was fantastic. i had the duck confit tacos with a pomegranate bbq sauce and the spicy salsa verde. they were wonderful and the portion was very large. i took about half of it home with me. sooooo good.   i had a regular margarita and also their special margarita - a cucumber one with a spicy red pepper salt on the rim of the glass. so, so, so tasty. delicious!  great place. super cute decor, fantastic service, great location, wonderful food."}
{"text":"I wish I was able to review the food here, but we were unable to eat.  We arrived at 5:05 and the place was well occupied for a Tuesday.  This should be a sign of quality.  But, we stood by the door for nearly 15 minutes before we could get anyone's attention.  When we did catch her eye, she just gently tossed a couple menus our way and carried on with her business. It took another ten minutes before we could ask what happy hour was, since the menu has the hours, but does nothing to signify what the deals were.  Obviously irritated we would have the audacity to ask a question, she was a bit terse.  Since it was happy hour, and half the tables were occupied and half were reserved, we excused ourselves to what ended up being a much better happy hour elsewhere.  In the server's defense working the patio, he was apologetic when inquiring why we were leaving.  He wanted to know if we wanted him to inquire about the wait inside, and we said no thank you, as we had already wasted over 35 minutes of our \"happy\" time.  Not sure if we will give them another chance to take our money, or not.  We have had plenty of quality experiences elsewhere.  We'll see..."}
{"text":"Tried Momocho at a pre-event to Progressive Field opening for the 2016 season. I had a chicken quesadilla and chorizo nachos.  The chicken quesadilla was really good except there was a super spicy red sauce that I didn't much care for.  The chorizo tacos were awesome. They had chorizo, black beans, creama and cheese. Not too spicy."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican in Cleveland! The menu is ever changing and the food is deeply flavorful each time. The guacamole is the best I've had with unique flavor options. Reservations are usually required, especially on weekend. The vibe is definitely cozy, but not cramped. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"My absolute Favorite when I'm in the mood for Mexican.  I'm pretty sure I've eaten just about every item on the menu... twice:-P From the guacamole (my favs are the Crab, Smoked Salmon and the Goat Cheese varieties) to the tacquitos to the warm green bean salad to the albondigas- you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a Sunday night. I got the Tinga Taquitos (mini corn tortillas with chicken skewers). We shared the smoked trout and bacon guacamole. The guac was delicious. I would come here again for the guac. Fresh corn chips came with it, free refills, great chips. The chicken taquitos were unimpressive. The chicken was a slightly over cooked and it very flavorful. Came with a green salsa and fresh tomato salsa which were good. They also have a very tasty hot sauce if you ask.  Service was good and very quick."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan on Momocho, mostly because it's so hidden and the decor inside is really neat as well. It's very hard to get a table in the summer without a wait so I highly recommend making reservations. I also recommend trying the Guacamole sampler."}
{"text":"Good food and a decent staff in terms of attentiveness and friendliness. Parking was not an issue. Wait time for a table was minimal though I visited earlier in the evening on a Weekday. Pork was a touch on the dry side but the sauce was a good remedy for that."}
{"text":"Love it here. Came here with 8 girls for a birthday party. Our server was great, the drinks were awesome, the guacs are fun. The atmosphere is crazy and eclectic. I highly recommend this as one of the restaurants you visit if coming to Cleveland for the first time. Love."}
{"text":"Food was sent back bc the meat tasted spoiled or just old! Attitudes were so nasty by staff that we will never ever go there again!! How do they stay in business treating paying customers the way they do??? Seriously!! Less than mediocre sides, over cooked meat that tasted like they tired to cover the flavor of dirt with slime...thinking it was an improvement!!  I will stick closer to home when being ripped off of my money & time! The replacement food was even worse then the original nastiness....we refused it after 1 bite ea, paid for our drinks & left. We didn't even eat anywhere else after bc we all began feeling nauseous after 1 bite from both original food then replacement food! Been days & I get dry heaves just thinking about the food here!!!  I am being super conservative with my Yelp review too....It was pretty heinous food & I am shocked that so many positive reviews are racked up by this place!! Maybe employees write the positive reviews or something bc I feel like I ate in the Twilight Zone bc it was  so so bad compared to reviews!! Yelpers avoid wasting your time & money....may also turn you off Mexican food for life....yep THAT bad!"}
{"text":"It's about time I got my butt to Momocho!  My wife bought me tickets to see the Cleveland Orchestra for my birthday.  I've been longing to see them at Severance Hall since a field trip in fourth grade.  So we decided to go to Momocho and then see the amazing Cleveland Orchestra in the astoundingly beautiful, Severance Hall.  My wife made the Momocho reservations two weeks in advance and they were booked solid, except for one spot - the chef's spot.  I didn't know what she meant by that, but when we arrived, we were seated upstairs at a two-seat bar facing directly into the kitchen.  Basically, we got to be close-up spectators of the Momocho cooking show.  It turns out that the chef would talk to us, SERVE us, and entertain us.  It was really quite the experience!    Make your reservations early.  The website says they're optional, but in reality, they're required if you want to get in.  Momocho does not serve lunch and the lot is always full before dinner, so expect to park down the street somewhere.  The local, tattooed, bandana-wearing chef was very friendly to us and gave us a few free samples.  This included a taste of his very own delicious recipe - bread pudding, and two different margaritas.  He asked us if we had been to Momocho before, and since we hadn't, we asked him to make recommendations.  So, he whipped up some special guacamole for us that he said, 'wasn't on the menu'.  It had onions, garlic, sour cream, bacon, and it was really delicious.  Then he handed us an overflowing basket of fresh tortilla chips, which were tastefully seasoned, and a side of Salsa Verde.  Yum!  The green salsa had great flavor and texture, with a little spicy kick.  The bacon guac was just awesome and they really give you a lot, so one serving is more than enough for two people, if you get a side of salsa too.  For drinks, we were promptly served water and then we ordered some margaritas.  My wife ordered the Mango Margarita and I ordered the Blood Orange variety.  It turns out that the Mango was too 'citrusy,' but the Blood Orange was really delicious!  So on our second round, we both ordered a Blood Orange.  Since we were being served by the comical chef, we asked him some questions about the dishes he was preparing for other guests.  He obliged and made some dinner recommendations for us.  My wife ordered the Carnitas and based on the chef's recommendation, I ordered Chancho, which includes wild boar.  This was my first time trying this meat and I have to say, it was quite good.  I was a little surprised how small the Taquitos were, but whatever, they were good.  The Taquito meat is served over a bed of sauteed onions and a few other veggies, and the soft tortillas are served on the side, which completes the package.  We ordered Flan for dessert, which was creamy and delicious.  The chef told us that Momocho uses approximately 65 cases of avacados per week, so I'm wondering why this restaurant isn't called El Aguacate, or The Avacado, seriously.  Momocho is all about Guacamole.  Our meals were delicious and we vowed to return for another go.  With drinks and tip, our total came to $122."}
{"text":"Not surprisingly for those who TRULY know me, I had the Carnitas. They were wonderful with the aspects of them that I love (I guess that would be the meatiness?)  and the added pleasure of some interesting non-traditional flavors.  The carnitas did not have as much crispiness on the outer layer as more traditional versions that I've had, but the flavor more than made up for it. They gave me the molé sauce by mistake and it was incredible, and good pairing along with the other sauces meant for the carnitas. The guacamole was incredible as well. I ordered the traditional for this go-round, but next time I would definitely try the goat cheese. Even though I had to squeeze in and out of a space at the bar, it was a very fun experience!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is ridiculous.  Went here to get some authentic Mexican food with my husband and his parents. It's a tiny and incredibly dark restaurant. We were seated and noticed the menu had at least five types of Guac, all really expensive. They also include things like tacos with duck confit and foie gras. I grew up in Southern California, and I'm sure you're never--make that NEVER EVER--supposed to have that junk in tacos.  When we asked the waitress if there was a place where we could get regular, authentic food, she made a disgusted face, mustered all the disdain she could and said, \"You mean, like, cheap Mexican food?\"   Yes. I'd like some cheap, authentic, no-nonsense, no BS Mexican food. If you're looking for that, then don't go here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there this past weekend. The food was amazing. We will definitely be going back when I'm not pregnant to enjoy some of their margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Momocho is muy, muy bueno!   (Ok, enough pretending I'm billingual).   Another Diners, Dive-Ins and Drives location we decided to hit up while visiting Cleveland, this off-the grid Mexican place hit the spot in a big way! We were drawn here by their generous and adventurous guacamole offerings, and in the process I was exposed to the best chile chipotle mojo sauce I've had in my life (no hyperbole - real deal Holyfield).  Advance scouting suggested we needed to arrive early, so we were waiting outside prior to their 4pm (Sunday) opening. Soon, other prospective patrons were joining us on the sidewalk in anticipation of the glorious grub that was waiting.   We started with the guacamole sampler to taste three of their fabulous guac offerings. Our choices were (1) traditional, (2) black pepper pecorino + agave nectar + roasted garlic, & (3) smoked trout + bacon + chile poblano. Yes, I said smoked trout. This was apparently one of the call-outs during their DDD feature. In my astute/humble opinion, the black pepper pecorino/agave nectar selection was DIVINE.....like, borderline heaven-sent.....A+. The original was solid. The trout was surprising not overpowering and the bacon added a supple punch of meaty goodness. I recommend all three wholeheartedly!  We also added a nice round of chips and salsa (sikil pak) for fun. Solid salsa + chips too.  With so much guacamole, we decided to split some tacos (taquitos) from the menu. Going with the carnitas (adobo + citrus braised pork + honey + the aforementioned chile chipotle mojo), served family style: tortillas first, meat adjourning, we were overwhelmed with the flavors (in a good, robust way).   In short, we made some very, very excellent choices for our visit to this gem of a dining spot. I still dream about that chile chipotle mojo sauce....what we took for leftovers (generously and graciously boxed up by our server), I simply had to finish later that evening. Fat pants may have been involved. :-)  Definitely one of the best out of town, Mexican dining spots I've been fortunate to enjoy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a self proclaimed taco expert and I have to say I'm a big fan of Momocho. The only downfall is the small location, wait times here can be a pain so if you're planning on heading there on a weekend I would be sure to call ahead! Good news is that they've recently renovated so there's now more room upstairs. I was intrigued by their list of interesting margarita flavors, so naturally I had to order the sampler. I tasted the spicy mango, blood orange, and pomegranate! All three were excellent but the spicy mango was next level - this would probably be my go-to on a return visit. I'm a fan of all things spicy, but this drink only had a hint so anyone could probably handle the heat! The taquitos are divine and the serving sizes look small but both times I've been I've struggled to finish because the portions are so hearty. We dug in to the carnitas and the machaca and I don't have a bad thing to say about either dish. I was hesitant to order the machaca because coffee braised beef sounded intimidating but it ended up being my favorite. We also had the crab guacamole which was great but I would love to try some of the other flavors. Momocho doesn't disappoint and it's a popular spot for a reason!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Momocho's on a Sunday afternoon.  Food was great, 3 of us had entrees of scallops, pork chop, meatballs; all were excellent in preparation presentation and size.  Had the guacamole sampler as an appetizer - very good I think we preferred the crab to the others but the smoked trout guacamole was also good.  Service was fine, helpful gracious.good recommendation.  Parking can be a challenge.  Reservations a good idea we were early but they seated us immediately."}
{"text":"Four stars!  I absolutely love the guacamole at Momocho- they have so many different types and it's always so fresh. My fave has been the crab, the jicama, and essentially lots of others.  Happy hour is a great deal too- the taquitos are half priced!   In terms of taquitos: - The tinga is delicious- sixteen spiced chicken. Mmmmm.   - chancho is moist and flavorful - coliflor- surprisingly, a favorite of ours. The curry and cauliflower are a great combo - machaca- easily one of my faves-the coffee and brisket is definitely a winner  I've come to love and appreciate Momocho and really have gone back multiple times over the course of the time I've been in CLE. I think the food keeps improving and getting better, making it easily a go-to place when I have visitors in town."}
{"text":"Featured on Diners, Drive-in's, & Dives we got here a little before 5:00 when it opens and there was already a line outside.  We barely squeaked in with 2 spots at the bar but it was very worth it! We had the guacamole sampler (it's a lot of gauc think enough for 6 definitely too much for two) and the Machaca Tacos (shredded beef brisket) seriously some of the best tacos I've had!  Would love to try everything on the menu! The margaritas were very good too!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a random trip to Cleveland. A bit expensive (I kind of expected that from the hipster vibes) but the food was really good. I got the carnitas tacos and the pork was cooked in this sort of citrus-y sauce. Sounds weird but it was really good! My margarita was gross but I did that to myself by being silly and choosing the habanero peach ...yea, I know. I'd come back if someone else was paying.  ** super important - the menu was a bit confusing, but our wait did a really good job explaining everything."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but wasn't awesome either. I went here in 2012 and had a HORRIBLE experience w/ one of the waiters. Definitely felt as if prejudgements were made when the person I was with decided to send their subpar food back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Cleveland as far as I'm concerned.  The margaritas are spectacular, the guacamole is fresh-off-the-avocado-tree good, and the coffee braised brisket is some of the best beef I've ever eaten.  Make sure to cap off your meal with a delicious Mexican coffee and one of their desserts.  I had the bread pudding, which was great, but the fried ice cream looked delicious as well."}
{"text":"Momocho was okay in my opinion. I have heard many great things about it and the reservation was always hard to make and when I finally was able to go there, I probably expected a lot from it. and of course, high expection is always followed by disappointment.   They are very famous for their guacamole, so we ordered the sampling platter. It was ok in my opinion but the smoked trout did not have that many pieces of trout in the guac, and the original was a little bland. Then I ordered scallop for entree and it was way too salty for me. The scallop was cooked appropriately - not burned or undercooked but it was just too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"So Guy Fieri from Flavortown went here and he said in the Triple D book he liked it and his favorite was the machaca taquitos so my husband and I made this a destination place on our way to Cedar Point Amusement park.  No doubt the machaca taquitos was amazing.  We also ordered guacamole with goat cheese - awesome sauce!!!   This isn't a high end date night place nor a family place, this is an adult place with lots of alcoholic drinks to choose from.   I thought the waiter we had was great and obviously likes the food too.  He was super excited that we found the place because of Guy Fieri's visit.   Over all I would go here again but the place is very small.  They are trying to revitalize this area and this one gives hope."}
{"text":"Best guac in town with interesting flavors - my favorites were the smoked trout and goat cheese flavors, I would definitely recommend trying the sampler.    The service was honestly a little lacking and very slow at times.  I wasn't really blown away as most people claim to be by my entree lamb chops adobado --- overcooked and bland at time.  I loved my drinks however thought it was a great place for happy hour before hitting up the bars on w. 25th :)"}
{"text":"Tried to go once on a Friday night without reservation, and there was no seating for the next 2 hours. Finally made a reservation on a Sunday. They have a small private parking lot.   I ordered the traditional guacamole and chips for appetizer, bistec (steak taco), then had fried ice cream for dessert. Guac is awesome and the tortilla chips were freshly made and warm. Chips were so good, could have eaten it alone. Steak taco was delicious, served with 2 different sauces which were both great. Fried ice cream was interesting and amazing. It was a large round fried vanilla ice cream, tasted like cereal around it, with chocolate, whip cream and cherry on top. Drank dos equis and tried the margarita sampler which included 3 sample drinks, each was good. Service was good too.  Price was fairly expensive, for 2 people came up to ~$70, but def worth it."}
{"text":"There's so much to say. First (and I say this completely unashamed) my friend and I drank our way through the margarita menu. We had to try everyone! The best- obviously the cucumber margarita- everyone else will tell you that as well. (the fig was awful though- but I heard they took it off the menu) The guac trio is delicious- a must get. The food is beyond wonderful. Everything pretty much comes with tortillas and a sauce. The best is to trade your sauces amongst your party. And obviously try everyone else's dish. One of my favorite things about momocho is the atmosphere. It's cozy in the winter and the smaller dining room gives you a connection to other diners (as well as an easier way to see what other people order) Now I want a cucumber margarita...."}
{"text":"I ordered a trio of margaritas, which was a fun little tasting, and I would highly recommend the guava and the chilli mango if you like a little spiciness in your alcohol, but would skip the blood orange.  I happened to be sitting at the bar, though, and the margarita magic was diminished when I saw them pouring the margaritas out of what resembled industrial-sized vinegar jugs straight into glasses. At least if I was seated at a table, then I would be blissfully ignorant and believe that my (overpriced) margarita was individually hand crafted. lol -- they should transfer them to more attractive pitchers, etc. if they're going to serve it in front of customers to at least trick us.  The tortillas were on point, but we did have to wait a long time for more tortillas; I think I ordered the carnitas, which was very tender, but way too sour for me.    Oh yeah -- the guacamole: on the recommendation of our server/bartender, we settled on the crab guacamole, and it was terrible.  The crab was very fishy and didn't taste fresh -- I know I'm in the Midwest, but this was truly not good.  We managed to exchange it for the pineapple guac which had a nice sweetness to it, so it was initially all good.  Unfortunately, our bartender/server shafted us by charging us for both guacs, and then gave me attitude when I asked to have one of the guacamoles removed from the bill.  Anyway, I won that battle, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) and have zero plans to return."}
{"text":"I read many wonderful reviews about this place, and it really is all that! I ordered the seared sea scallops, and they were AMAZING! They were cooked perfectly with the most addicting jalapeno creamed corn. The hominy croqueta was also the perfect compliment to the dish.   We also had to try their 3 guac sampler. The guacamole with pineapple, jicama, and habanero was really good. It has a great balance of the guac flavor with a hint of sweetness. The habanero was a bit strong, so there were moments where I was reaching for the ice water. The second guac we tried was the blue crab with corn and chile chipotle. This one was definitely my favorite!!! It was amazing. The corn was sweet and the crab was a great compliment to the flavor of the guac. Lastly, we tried the smoked trout with bacon and chile poblano. It was good also; however, the smoky flavor kind of deterred me from loving the dish as much as the other ones. If the smoky flavor is your thing, then its a wonderful dish.   Overall, the food was great. The service was awesome; our waiter was patient and was very helpful in helping us explain the dishes. We sat in the outdoor patio, and I thought the ambiance was great. It would be a great place to hang out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Momocho is amazing!!! The guacamole sampler was suggested by out server since we were first timers and it was phenomenal.  I think the pineapple was my favorite and I paired it with a cucumber margarita.  The margarita was surprisingly refreshing and tasty.  This place is a little pricy but it's well worth it.  The waiter was so extremely helpful with recommendations and with explaining the menu!"}
{"text":"Sign me up for another visit. I went as it was featured on Food Network show Diner, Drive-Ins & Dives. You can watch show on YouTube. Restaurant lived it to reputation. Street parking in area if you look around. Dinning up stairs or on back patio. Consider seating at bar when crowded. Don't get the delicious guacamole in its many offerings unless two or more in party, too much for one."}
{"text":"WOW! Love this place. We drive up from Columbus just to eat in Cleveland! We saw this place on an episode of DDD and it made our mouths water.  Love the guacamole- the goat cheese poblano is our favorite. I love the margarita flights. I try different combinations every time we go- just enough portions to try the unique flavors. The homemade tortilla chips are excellent. We have never been for happy hour,  just dinner with a reservation.   The machacas and tamales are a favorite for an entree.   The owner, Eric is super nice. We even found some of his recipies online and tried making them at home!   If you are a huge foodie, ask to sit at the Chef's Table and you can watch how they make these wonderful delights! Our all time favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Got to love a place that decorates with portraits of Mexican westlers.  Got to.  THE FOOD:  Perhaps I'm spoiled for guacamole, having had a bona fide Texan as a college roomate, but the guac here is merely good, not mindblowing.  The tomatillo sauce was very, very tasty, but not as hot as we had been warned.  I liked the idea of the taquitos-- smaller, fajita style dishes.  After the inevitable flight of guac, there is not room for much else.  The pork chop with mole was very good, as were the accompanying tamale hush puppies.  The margueritas were fantastic.  I had a cactus flower and a blood orange.  I can't decide which was better.  Both had bright flavors that were not hidden by excessive sour mix.   Mon cher chou's cucumber  margurita was really tasty-- that was unexpected.  La famille du chou loved the traditional gold margueritas.  THE SERVICE:  Fabulous.  The waiter was knowledgeable and the staff, gracious.  They did tend to overestimate the heat factor of the dishes.  THE ATMOSPHERE:  Reminiscent of a Los Straightjackets concert-- in the best possible way."}
{"text":"A couple months ago, we were walking through Ohio City, enroute to a date with Johnny Mango, and walked past this curious place called Momocho. I'm like, \"What the fuck is THIS place, and why haven't I been here yet?\"   This illustrates is what a suburban dope I am. I had no idea Momocho has been around for years, had been featured on the Food Network, and serves up the most bad-ass Mexican food in the city. I needed to repair this cultural deficiency as soon as possible, and made reservations with a group of friends as soon as we were able to agree upon a date.   Walking into Momocho from bright afternoon sunlight is like being knocked unconscious...it's the darkest restaurant I've ever been it. Unless you can echolocate, you'll spend the first 15 minutes helplessly blind, waiting for your vision to restore to operating levels. Once your eyes adjust, and the surrounding objects start to assimilate themselves into 3-dimensional shapes, you become aware that you're sitting in what appears to be the cellar crypt of some demented Spanish monastery, where the monks worship Lucha Libre wrestlers instead of your more conventional deities. The lighting (if you want be so generous to call it that) is nothing but some sparse votives and a couple of weird, giant cocoon-looking pendant lights hanging near from the bar. (I was waiting for a nude Wilford Brimley to emerge.) It's totally bizarre atmosphere, but it's also kinda Euro/Latino sexy and I liked it immediately. You can show up in dirty jeans & T-shirt combo or dressed up in your best urban finery, and feel comfortable either way. (It's so fucking dark that no one can see what you're wearing, anyhow.) I had a partial for Momocho before I even tried the food.  And so, onto the food.....  The highlights of menu are thus: a) interesting guacamoles and b) taquitos with specialty meats like wild boar, beef brisket, duck, pork belly, etc. (Sadly, the roasted grasshopper taquitos advertised on their on-line menu are no longer offered, but I can't say I'm surprised. Clevelanders are just not ready for tacos filled with bugs.)   We ordered the sampling of three (3) guacamoles: the goat cheese & poblano, crab, and smoked trout and bacon. All three combinations were excellent, but the crab guacamole was the clear winner, with a surprisingly complex and gently-burning heat.   For the entrée, I ordered the wild boar taquitos. Although they contained enough salt to melt driveway ice, the accompanying sauces made the boar come alive with spicy goodness. Paired with some unconventional margaritas (cucumber margarita, anyone?) and a nice Spanish tempranillo, it was one of the most unique meals I've had in Cleveland in a very long time.  The only complaint was that service was a bit slow. Years passed between appetizer and entrée, but that just gave you time more to study the Lucha Libre photos and poetry scrawled across the walls. It's an atmosphere I didn't mind soaking in for a few hours.   Not that I'm into dudes in masks or anything."}
{"text":"If you live in NE Ohio and like Mexican food, this Ohio City eatery MUST be your next stop.  It's on the smaller side and fills up quick so I suggest a reservation, but even if you have to wait for a table, you will be rewarded with high quality ingredients and refreshingly original flavors.  This is NOT Tex Mex...I repeat, this is not Tex Mex!    Try the Tamales or the Taquitos they won't disappoint! My wife had the enfrijolada which was off the chain!  And if you like guacamole try the pineapple, mint and chile habanero!  My suggestion is to give it a stir and let it sit for a few minutes to allow the acid from the pineapple to soak in.  They even make their own chips that come out hot! Outstanding!  One more thing...Go now!  Just go!"}
{"text":"Good food. Pretty strong service. Definitely make reservations, as the wait is a doosie, otherwise."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get a margarita sampler. All of the margaritas are delicious. The food is also amazing."}
{"text":"If a friend from out-of-town comes to Cleveland for one dinner, Momocho is where I'm taking them.  It's all been said before, so I'll say it again.  Go-to items: - Cucumber margarita (chili lime salt takes it over the top) - Trout/bacon/poblano guacamole - The machaca taquito (coffee & ancho braised beef brisket) - might be my favorite dish in Cleveland.  Line up your beverage, a bowl of guacamole, 1.5 kinds of taquitos per person and you'll be doing fine with just enough room for a side & dessert."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I came because my brother works there any he's always raving about the food.    Here's what we got:    Guacamole sampler: blue cheese, pineapple jicama, and tradicional.  They were all amazing and the chips were freshly made so they went with them perfectly.  I got the duck taquitos with a side of sofrito green beans.  It was so yummy and the green beans were surprisingly great (I don't normally like green beans but I got them at my brother's recommendation).  My friends got the beef brisket taquitos and the pepito crusted trout entree.  They were both outstanding.  Finally my brother sent us a fried ice cream! :)  The service, atmosphere, and especially the food were all pretty much perfect, lol.  And what definitely kicked it up to 5 stars was the happy hour special (5-6:30pm M-F), so all our margaritas and taquito dishes were half price!    Go here.  But make reservations on weekends cuz it filled up pretty fast."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night ! It was pretty packed but got seated right away! The atmosphere was very dim and the seating area was very small! We looked over the menu and ordered the flights of margaritas  and their well known guacamole on tv! We ordered the pickled corn/crab/chile chipotle guacamole ! The guac came out with chips. The chips was really delicious and the guac stood out ! For our main entree we got the pork tacos and the beef pastrami tacos! All the tacos came with tortillas separately and the dish itself with different assorted condiments. In my opinion the pork tacos was okay! And the beef pastrami was not my favorite! The meat was in form of pastrami but the taste of it was very bland and plain! Overall the atmosphere was okay little dim for me! The service was good! The guacamole was very delicious but the tacos lacked a lot of flavor to me !"}
{"text":"Probably like most, I read the negative and positive reviews and tried to keep an eye out for some of the things being said. Reservation wise we were fine, I called a couple hours ahead on a wednesday night so I didnt have an issue. As expected the food was ridiculously good, the person I was with travels to Mexico a lot so was being a bit more of a snooty snoot about his stuff. Complained about some traditional drink not being right, but I think its nice to see restaurants put their own spin on things....  In terms of the staff....wow. It started down pouring while we were there so we sat and had a drink at the bar to wait it out. The bartender overheard us talking about our walk to the car a couple blocks away and asked one of the servers that was leaving if they'd give us ride. I cant believe how nice that was! I wish I could remember the names of the guys that helped us out, but either way I think that really speaks volumes about the business."}
{"text":"I travel to the Cleveland area about every other month - Momocho is first on my list of \"must visits\".  Since I can't say anything new that's already been said, here are my personal favorite things about Momocho:  -Atmosphere is super comfortable and friendly - extremely welcoming. -Guacamole and chips are some of the best I've had - ever. -The homemade habanero sauce IS the best I've ever had - I buy bottles to take home each time I come. -Service is always stellar. -The hot green bean salad - holy crap: it's melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.  Great job here - a quality and exciting business."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! I went with my brother, who is a very very picky eater, and he loved it! The main thing I pubs frustrating was that the happy hour is only available at the bar and downstairs. I didn't really understand this but it was fine, the stuff I wanted to try was not the stuff that was half off. I had the hibiscus margarita and it was the best drink I've had in a while! You must try it!!!"}
{"text":"Defiantly a place you want to get a reservation for and a bit out of the city proper, but it's well worth it. With six different guacamoles it's recommend you get a sampler to try several different ones. As for the rest of our meals, they were all very tasty and I can't image finding anything on the menu that wasn't good. I'm not from the Cleveland area but would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Cleveland for the weekend, for a wedding.  We asked the bride, groom and their family for restaurant suggestions.  They had suggested a few restaurants including Momocho. The first restaurant we called did not have anymore reservations.  Thankfully we were able to get a reservation, for a great booth in the bar, at Momocho.  Our waiter, Eric, could not have been any nicer.  He was very helpful and gave us great suggestions.  We started off our meal with an amazing guacamole with blue crab, corn and chile chipotle.  We wanted to order the three guacamole sample but were informed it would be entirely too much guacamole for two people.    We each ordered margaritas.  I had  a cucumber margarita and my boyfriend had a cactus fruit margarita.  Both were amazing.  They offer a margarita sampler, which we decided would be a wise choice to order.  We decided on a blood orange, hibiscus and pomegranate.   Each were fantastic.  I could taste the flavors, not the alcohol which sometimes happens at other restaurants.    For our main courses, I choose the seared sea scallops, hominy croqueta  with jalapeno creamed corn.  The scallops were nicely prepared.  They were tender and cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the pork chop al carbon with mole coloradito and huitlecoche \"tamale dumplings\".  The tamales were moist, not dry and dense.  The mole sauce was complimentary, not overpowering.    We don't typically order dessert, but since our meal was so enjoyable we thought that the desserts must be fantastic.  We decided to try the crema flameado with chocolate custard and caramelized sugar.  It was not like any other dessert we had had before.  There was a slight hint of chile powder with each bite.  One may think that this would ruin the dessert but it was amazing.    Overall, our experience was wonderful, from the service, the staff and our server.  My boyfriend had to buy a t shirt to commemorate our trip to Cleveland and to Momocho.  I hope to return someday."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours in Cleveland. I have been here for the dinner hours but the half off taquitos is well worth the price. I have tried the boar, pork, chicken and shredded beef taquitos. They were all excellent. The goat cheese guacamole was great. $1.25 or $1.50 Tecate is also a plus. The margaritas are good. My only bad experience here was because of the Cleveland Browns. Some of them brought their girlfriends here for happy hour. You have to be kidding me. You make millions of dollars a year and you are taking advantage of happy hour? And bringing some golddiggers along with you? Come on now. I do it out of necessity."}
{"text":"I've been to Momocho several times and I've always loved the food. However, last week I experienced the most terrible service that I've had in a really long time. I'm not actually saying that we didn't get served properly, we just got served very rudely. Nicole seemed very put off by our mere presence. The restaurant was empty on on Thursday night and I understand that servers are disappointed when you don't buy dinner, but NO ONE was waiting for our table.  Additionally, she charged us 20% automatic gratuity for 5 people. If Momocho actually has this policy, then I'm appalled. If they allow their servers to implement this when they are sensing frustration, then I'm still appalled.  It's disappointing that such a well -known and -loved place would hire someone with such a low level of service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cleveland late last Fall because he had some work training to do. As with any other trip/vacay - we based it about sights and food! We saw Momocho on Man Vs. Food and decided we absolutely had to go there.   There were some pros and cons in my opinion... Cons: *the crowd was a bit unfriendly and seemed pretentious (I felt we got the \"wow you're not from here\" looks - a lot)  *the service was mediocre (not the friendliest staff) *a bit on the pricey side  Pros: *The food was really good *the music and  decor wereunique and awesome"}
{"text":"First time to Cleveland, was checking out the area before moving there and the staff were all extremely friendly. A little pricier than I was expecting, but a very unique spin on Mexican food. I would definitely recommend the Tinga, delicious and perfectly seasoned. The drinks were great, I don't remember our waiters name but he was so knowledgeable about Tequila, the history of the maker of the tequila he recommended. I really liked all the different variations of guacamole they prepare, even if you just like regular guac, try the sampler guac and get two new ones. The pineapple guac was really good and the goat cheese guac wasn't half bad. The staff and service alone was phenomenal, the manager came around to make sure everything was going fine, recommend areas of Cleveland to look for places to live or stay away from. Great atmosphere, staff, service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Date night. You can totally risk it if it's just you and your boo, but chances are you will be waiting for a table. It's worth the wait though. If you want something more than date night, make sure to call ahead (recommend 2 weeks advance) for reservations. This place is awesome, it's got the \"I'm not in Ohio\" vibe of some cool places you can't normally find without actually leaving Ohio.   Tried the Hibiscus margarita recently, definitely check that out if your there. I loved it, and I'm the type that doesn't stray from tradicionale. If you like avocado be prepared for guacamole heaven. You really can't go wrong with their guac, but I'd definitely make your way to the goat cheese.   My new favorite taquito is the Machaca/coffee-beef-brisket... Damn good. The wild boar or chicken skewer taquitos are great too.   If your still kickin' and make it to dessert, I've been three times and haven't got to this level yet, check out the fried ice cream. I've seen it every time I'm there and it looks crazy good.  If your still reading and haven't called to set up a date yet, then I'm guessing this isn't your place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of my Favorites! Can't miss restaurant!! Best Margaritas and I'm a beer snob.  Guacamole choices the best in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"My birthday treat this year was an experimental trip to Eric William's luchador inspired MOMOCHO.  It was a big risk going to an unknown restaurant for a birthday but based upon the reviews here I felt it was a safe bet.  I was fully prepared for as the menu clearly states a reservation based on a two hour dining experience.  Looking online and at the restaurant they like to promote their guacamoles and the cucumber margarita.  Not sure which guacamole would be the best to try I ordered the 3 choice sampler of the traditional, goat cheese-tomatio-chille poblano & blue crab-corn-chile chipotle.  Unfortunately I thought while good the guacamole wasn't a star dish and not worth the exorbitant price.  The cucumber margarita on the other hand was not only unique but much tastier than expected.  Instead of the guacamole I could see myself spending an evening dining on the salsa sampler and the real superstar cucumber margarita all by itself.  The taquitos are served with warm flour tortillas similar to fajitas with pico de gallo and salsa verde, one word - yum!  I also tried the seared sea scallops-hominty croqueta-jalapena cream corn that was perfectly cooked with a delicious cream sauce.  For birthdays or any other time you have a wish for a wonderful dining experience Momocho is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"This place. There almost aren't words to describe how much I love it.   To be completely honest, I came here on a whim one day after remembering it was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. We started out with an order of guac, the one with the goat cheese, and it was to die for. I could have stopped the meal right there and been satisfied.   For my entree I ordered the machaca. I didn't think it could get better after the guac, but it did. The meat was perfectly tender, the salsa verde perfectly complimented its sweetness and the guac was the perfect addition to create a perfect bite. I also tried the camarones and they had great flavor as well if you like shrimp. (My only complaint would be there isn't as much shrimp as there is in the meat meal.)   This is one of my go-to Cleveland restaurants. They also have one of the best happy hours in the city. But get there early because the specials only apply to the bottom floor and it fills up fast."}
{"text":"We started the night off with chips and guacamole.  They were both freshly made and did not last long at the table.  For the main dish I got a beef brisket and my wife got Mahi mahi.  The brisket had a little heat.  The fish was grilled and very light.  The only regret we had was not having enough time for dessert!"}
{"text":"Last year, my sister came to visit me in Cleveland with her 6 month old and wanted to try Momocho after checking out the menu online. We called ahead to ask if they were kid friendly and they stated \"absolutely...we love babies!\". We were greeted at the door by Eric (James Beard award winning chef and owner) himself and taken upstairs and away from the bar area to ensure our comfort. A high chair was provided and Eric himself came to check on us to ensure we were happy and comfortable. The food was INCREDIBLE and our entire experience is still reminisced about by us to this day. I no longer live in Cleveland and we joke about taking a trip there just to eat at Momocho. Definately recommend the guacamole sampler and guava margarita to start things off and the rest of the menu is creative and devine."}
{"text":"I love this place! Momocho has been one of my favorite restaurants since moving to Cleveland four years ago.  I've been here several times and the food has been consistently great. My favorite thing on the menu? Spicy Mango margaritas!! They are always amazing and I love the complement of the chili lime salt on the rim.  Of course the guacamole is stellar and I appreciate that you get one basket of chips - you will be charged if you ask for more.  That helps me control myself when it comes to the chip department ;)  The warm fennel and green bean salad appetizer is always a winner, and I usually end up getting some version of the taquitos when I visit.  The menu changes fairly often, but there are always at least two vegetarian taquito options.  On my most recent sojourn one was a beet option (LOVE my beets!!) and the other was a lovely parsnip and squash offering.  Both were very good; the latter was highlighted with a tangy parsnip vinaigrette.   I also recommend finishing your meal with the Mexican coffee. It's brewed with cinnamon and brown sugar for just the right amount of sweetness and flavor.  I add some cream to mine for a perfect end-of-meal treat.  Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"One a recent trip back home to Cleveland, I had the pleasure of being treated to a night out at Momocho. It has a very unique and intimate atmosphere I enjoyed. We were fortunate to get a table on the second floor and received excellent service throughout our meal.  I am not a huge margarita drinker, but my friend encouraged me to try the margarita sampler--three margaritas (in rock glass-sized glasses) for $15. I was really blown away by two of the flavors: Spicy Mango and Cucumber margaritas. What I loved best about the Spicy Mango was the rim of my glass, which had just a bit of red pepper mixed in with the salt to give it a nice bite.  We started out with an order of guacamole tradicional, which was excellent just by itself. I didn't feel adventurous enough to try some of the more unusual guac blends with goat cheese, pickled corn, or smoke trout. They just sounded very unappetizing to me. I do like spicy foods, however, so our waitress brought over a bottle of their homemade habañero sauce, which was phenomenal. I added that to my guacamole and thoroughly enjoyed it.  For an entree I had the tinga taquitos--sixteen spiced grilled chicken with the chili ancho and pomegranate barbacoa. The chicken was very tender and had a great smoky flavor.  Overall, it was a very good dining experience. The menu was a bit pricey, but atmosphere and food were very enjoyable, as was my company that evening!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! The guacamole is seriously the best I have ever had. I may have to get a job washing dishes so I can steal the recipe!  Get the one with goat cheese.   We shared our tacos and the beef and pork belly are both to die for! I didn't love the carnitas quite as much but still good,"}
{"text":"I write the following review about Mexican food with the full disclosure that I am a native Texan, and am fully qualified to judge Mexican food (Tex-Mex or not.)  Pretense aside, here we go...  GO HERE.  Stop looking for other places to eat.  Go.  The taquitos are amazing - flavorful, artful - downright scrumptious.  The MACHACA is slow-braised beef brisket cooked in a coffee marinade, and it's one of my favorites.  The chips and salsa are excellent, and you can ask for the homemade house habanero sauce to make it a little more lively (read: spicy, Texas style) if you like.  I also can't stop singing about the margaritas (though warning: 3 of these, and you're going to be impaired!) - the cucumber, spicy mango, and classic (with chili lime salt) are outstanding.  They are unequaled by any margaritas in Ohio that I know of.  To add brilliance to magic, this place has a HAPPY HOUR (downstairs only, at the bar - not outside or upstairs) where classic margaritas and taquitos are HALF OFF.  You can literally eat a full meal and 2 margaritas for under $20 - and this is craft cuisine!  The staff is always friendly, welcoming and witty - a good place for food, banter and fun; the atmosphere is very artsy and eclectic - and downright homey.  This place does OHIO CITY proud."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it never disappoints. The guacamole sample is always a must--the crab one is my personal favorite but any of them are amazing. The margaritas are great as well, and they have so many flavors! They also have a marg sampler if you'd like to try a few. The place is always packed (maybe since Guy Fieri featured it on Triple D), so get there early and maybe, just maybe you'll grab a seat at the bar.   Parking around the area is a little hard. They only have a small lot and the rest is residential street parking. Again, get there early."}
{"text":"Food: Amazzinggg. Everything is so flavorful and delicious. Made with fresh ingredients and very high quality.  Service: This place is always packed. Our waiter was very good, but very busy. DEFINITELY MAKE A RESERVATION. It's a small restaurant and very popular.  Cleanliness: Good!  Prices: They seem a little high until you taste everything and find out why."}
{"text":"Had a date night with the wife recently and decided to try Momocho from a recommendation of a friend.  I saw all the reviews and decided to go with the Guacamole sampler.   We got an original, crab, and pineapple habanero as our choices.  Original was just regular old plain guac.  I wouldn't get that again.  Not with so many different choices to choose from.  Next, the crab didn't do it for me.  My wife liked it, though.  So if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  My favorite was the pinapple habanero.  Simply outstanding.  Next time I may opt for just 1 guac and some salsas.  My wife ordered the pork carnitas and I had the hanger steak.  Both meals were completely cooked to perfection and was more than enough food for dinner.  Heck, the guac was more than enough.  I ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  Coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  Was amazing.  The bread pudding had the jalapeno taste without the bite.  Was also to do for.  I highly recommend it.  They tell you when you make the reservation that your experience will last about 2 hours.  That was spot on.  We didn't feel rushed.  Nor did we feel it was too slow.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will easily go back.  The best part was I didn't spend as much as I thought I would.  So its very reasonable."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, but won't bore you with all the details of my day/my dinner date/the weather/various other unrelated information that many Yelpers seem to be a fan of.  We arrived a little after 5 on a Saturday, and snagged the last two seats at the bar.  All the other tables were reserved, so if you're dining out with a group I'd definitely recommend making reservations.  They offer samplers/flights of margaritas and guacamole, and they offer unusual flavors.    We did a margarita sampler with hibiscus, spicy mango, & blood orange, all of which were good and I would consume in their full-sized version. We had a hard time deciding which guac to choose, since they all sounded so amazing.  We went with the goat cheese guac, and this is a decision that we did not regret. We chose to share the carnitas taquitos, which was a good idea because the portion was definitely too much for one person.  The food was very good and the service was very prompt and friendly.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Five stars for doing the right thing. You received a complaint from a customer and did everything you could to make it right. Including offering a free meal. The fact that it was not accepted in the same spirit in which it was offered says more about the customer than you. Because, you know, they heard from someone whose brother road his bike passed the restaurant one day that you try to move tables too quickly. Maybe next time the customer should find out themselves if that was the case. What better way to do that than to dine there for free and discover the answer for themselves."}
{"text":"After the first bite of my food I said \"We're coming back next week.\" This place has it all: relaxed and casual atmosphere makes you want to sit and chat for hours, great staff had a lovely conversation with the seating host and the waitress, didn't feel rushed. I ended up dining on the patio which was definitely more relaxed and mellow than inside the bar/restaurant area.   I ordered \"Pato\" which is a duck confit taquito dish and the side of smoked gouda tamale dumplings. Yumyumyumyum. The food was cooked well and very flavorful, although I have to say, I think it's the sauce that really makes it. Ended the meal with jalepeno bread pudding-which tasted more like a kick ass creme brulee with a hint of jalepeno (trust me it was good, not spicy). This is not quick and dirty Mexican food but definitely expect a great meal when you come."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Cleveland by far. Best guac dip amazingggggggggg"}
{"text":"I had been to Momocho three or so years ago and it was the best Mod Mex food I have ever had.  Fast forward until now, and I wanted to share the delicious experience I had with my fiancé.  We started with the smoked trout guacamole, which was exactly how I remembered it (delicious).  My fiancé had a traditional margarita and stated it was one of the best she has ever had.  The server was attentive and friendly.  I ordered one of the fish dishes they offer, and  she ordered a chicken dish.  Both were very forgettable, with flavors that did not make you want to continue eating more  The fish I ordered had a sour flavor to it, which I could not pinpoint what spice was causing it.  Ambiance is nice, overall flow of the restaurant is unique with stairs leading up and separate stairs to leave.  Might give them another try, but with Cleveland being saturated with so many other great restaurants, it will be awhile before we do."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks! I went with my sweetie on a Thursday night. Sat at the bar and was served by Brooke who was great. We Ordered the margarita sampler with spicy mango, cucumber, and strawberry mint. All tasty and refreshing but we liked the second round better--guava, hibiscus, and pineapple. We started with the Gouda and tomato guacamole. It was good but not amazing. If I'm ever in the area again I will try the one with garlic and Cleveland honey(?) sounded really good. For dinner I had the pescado taquitos. These taquitos dishes are more like build-your-own-tiny-tacos dishes. Really really good tho...great flavor and THE SAUCE! Their house salsa verde is out of this world. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"One of the many trendy stylish bar/restaurants on Fulton Road.  What sets them apart is the noise, the ambience..this place is hip; it is alive! Good luck finding a reservation on a weekend though. The wait times can exceed an hour. We had to call in at 3 pm to get reservations for a group of 5 for 9 pm. The wait was worth it. Their guacamole sampler is fantastic, should definitely try it. Plenty and plenty of guac, paradise for my guacamole craving friends!  My wife tried the margarita sampler and loved it too. The menu choices aren't by any means exhaustive, but definitely different! Will go again to try out some exotic sounding ones. Just a mention about the wait staff; They are excellent, very patient and friendly, always ready to help. Kinda refreshing in such a busy place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland, OH. The guacamole sampler is a must. My favorite is the smoked trout and bacon guacamole. The goat cheese guacamole is also very very good. The taquitos are all very good, including the duck confit and the brisket. The margaritas are delicious and the service is terrific."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the portion sizes are small and it is pretty pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants. If you're going, call ahead, it gets very busy."}
{"text":"All I can say is GO... I am in foodie nirvana... Cool atmosphere and the best meal of my life... As someone who grew up on the East side and now lives in Miami, I would fly back monthly to eat here...  No words can express how good this place is...."}
{"text":"Roommate saw this restaurant on tv one day and wanted to check it out.   I normally don't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature. They absolutely tasted amazing and would gladly get a drink again only if someone else is driving.  The food there was different in an good way. I tried their shrimp and their brisket, both are amazing. Highly recommend this place, but good luck trying to find a seat."}
{"text":"Momochofication complete.  I finally see what the kids are talking about.  As others have extolled, by the end of your stay at this upmarket modern Mex establishment, you will already be planning your next visit.    They have, by far, one of the most generous happy hours in the area.  $5 margaritas, served smooth and balanced in tall glasses.  Half price on all of their taquitos plates--not those greasy fried tortilla cigar-shaped things, but actual petite sized soft corn tortillas served in a stack with accompanying fillings and sauces for you to assemble.  You could easily make a hearty meal out of a taquitos plate alone.  The rules for these special deals are that you must dine on the first floor, between 5:00-6:30pm, Tuesday-Friday.  You should definitely make a reservation (people were lined up outside to get in right at 5pm) and don't be late, or they may give your table away.    Every step of the meal reads quality and generous portions.  Tortilla chips come out warm and perfectly salted.  Guacamole is mounded high into the serving cup and deliciously nuanced with whatever flavors you've chosen (the smokiness of the trout add-in was a surprising hit for me).  In the camarones taquitos, sweet plump shrimp have a garlicky edge.  The smoked gouda tamale dumplings are little flavor bombs.  I will continue to dream about this food until the next time I can schlep back to Ohio City.  This is one of my favorite restaurant experiences in Cleveland."}
{"text":"GRUDGE... I've yet to forgive. This was 2 years ago but I can't forget this! My friends and I came here and the wait was very long for a table, So we STOOD around the bar (which was also packed) and we had a few drinks. I ask for my bill to leave and I'm handed a bill for 9 people with gratuity. We had no waitress... no seat... no food... no difference between my group and another (they even made our group to be larger than it was just because we spoke to strangers also around the bar). The staff thought this was appropriate and acted like this was totally normal. I thought I was in the twilight zone. I can't go back because of this!"}
{"text":"Superlative Mexican food. We did the \"Chef's Table\" and both chefs working that night were super nice! We were offered several delicious samples which let us try a bunch of stuff. The crab guacamole, the Gouda cheese tamales and the carnitas taquitos were my favorites.   I loved the food and the service and would go out of my way to dine here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Cleveland. The guacamole you crave for years. Great service. Sit on the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Momocho is my favorite Mexican restaurant and it is unlike any I have ever been too.  The space is small so large groups may be a challenge but the decor is based on Mexican wrestlers.  The margaritas are pre-mixed but their variety of flavors are worth trying from blood orange to hibiscus.     You will not get complimentary chips and salsa, you will not get rice and beans with every meal like other establishments.  Most meals come with tortillas and 2 sauces with which you make little tacos.  I find the food irresistible and don't miss the usual accompaniments.  It's probably too pricey if you want to eat their all the time but every once in a while you crave something special, so you go for it."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic experience it's a bit of a hidden gem especially for outsiders. I was lucky enough to be introduced by a local friend. You have to get the different varieties of fresh, made to order guacamoles as well as the different takes on margaritas."}
{"text":"This place came so highly recommended to me, I couldn't wait to go.       I have to say that I was a little disappointed.       We got the guac sampler and it was good but I honestly make better guac myself.  We got the salsa trio and those were really good.  Homemade chips were very good.      I then got the chorizo fundido.  It was kind of gross.  You're supposed to make little tacos with the corn tortillas they give you but it was just one giant mass of melted shredded cheese.  I had to cut it with a knife.  And underneath was a TON of grease.  I am a chorizo fanatic and theirs was overcooked.        I then got the atun.  The tuna was ok, seasoned nice.  The server told me that the recommended temperature is rare and I said medium rare was fine, that I don't want  cold fish...It was cold inside and poorly plated with some slivers of luke warm onions and jalapenos underneath.  I was most excited about the candied jalapenos but they just tasted like wet green bell peppers.      My girl got the scallop entree.  The scallops were cooked nice and seasoned nice but not washed very well, the bite I had was gritty.  The menu says it is served with poblano creamed corn and horseradish crema.  But there were tomatoes and peppers under the scallops.  And maybe a few kernels of corn.  It was not plated well either; everything was red except for the frita.  Maybe it was our cook's first day.  You'd think the expediter would catch these things.      My other friend got the empanadas and those were not only delicious but plated colorfully and creatively.        Total bill was $108.  I will try this place one more time but I'm a little apprehensive.        They do however have the greatest habanero hot sauce ever!  Bought a bottle to take home."}
{"text":"DON'T GO to MOMOCHO MODMEX in Ohio City without a reservation. We tried going last night and they told us a 45 minute wait as a walk up. We stood by the bar (no seats there either), as party after party was seated. After 1 1/4 hours, I asked how much longer, I was told that we would be the next party seated, after another now 9:00 p.m. reservation. Seeing as not one table left in the 1 1/4 hours we were there, and some were still getting food. I understand honoring reservations, but don't take walk ups if you are not going to work them in"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Mexican I have EVER had. Margaritas are great too! Great bar vibe but ok for kids too, if they're on a 'leash'! Two outside seating areas. FUN FUN FUN and you WILL have leftovers. Roadside parking, take your umbrella. SO SO SO WORTH IT, even if it's raining. Momocho does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I really dig this place! Great food and the cucumber margaritas are a must try!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! I suggest making reservations or going early in order to obtain a seat. We were lucky enough to get right in, but the seats quickly filled up. We enjoyed an array of Margaritas (Guava, Blood Orange, and Hibiscus Flower), Crab Guacamole, Smoked Trout and Crab in a verde sauce, Kobe Beef Meatballs, and a Ginger Snap/Jalapeno Bread Pudding dessert that will knock your socks off! The waiters were so kind and always made sure we were satisfied and had plenty of water. I highly recommend stopping here for dinner if you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Dude, please warn patrons whats 86 before they start drooling over the prospect of your morst popular dish! Better yet, if you always sell out of it, buy more Ingredients! I was very pleased with my rabbit empanadas, the white chocolate shavings on top with mole underneath was amazeballs.  I loved my side of kale with the pumpkin seeds, special sauce and raisins too.  I think I may attempt to visit you once again when I'm back in Cleveland next week, but I may call to reserve my order! Thanks for the photo opp withh nacho libre by the way. Good times!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded with locals(?).  Regardless, the happy hour is the best--half price on their food?  Tapas?  Pretty amazing margaritas?  That's enough to keep me going."}
{"text":"Now that's what you call Mexican food. Something more thn burrito or taco. Guacamole is to die for.."}
{"text":"People seem to REALLY like this place, and I'll admit it was pretty good, but my issue is the price. I find all of their menu options to be just slightly over the price I'm willing to pay for Mexican food, no matter how \"modern\" it claims to be. The \"taquitos\" (actually just small tacos) platters run around about $14-$16 for 5 small tacos, which seems like a pretty good deal, however I found the amount of protein you get in the portion to be quite small for 5 tacos, and they overly rely on pickled options and sauces to supplement the portion sizes.    Their margaritas are similar to Barrio's in my opinion, quite sweet and flavored with a thick juicy pulp. I think a lot of people like these type of margaritas, but I prefer something a little less sweet and a little more tart/sour.   I will say that the chips and guacamole were fabulous, but at the same time it's a little disappointing when after spending $60 for a meal for two, the best thing is the chips and guacamole. I also do want to point out that our server was awesome at making recommendations and I had no complaints about service, my complaint lies only in my unwillingness to pay such a high price for Mexican when there are so many other places I can find that do it cheaper and dare I say, better. I think for those that are looking for something a little different though, Momocho should definitely satisfy."}
