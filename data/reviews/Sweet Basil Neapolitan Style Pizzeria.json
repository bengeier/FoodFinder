{"text":"This thin crust pizza is like eating a slice in NY. This is the best pizza place around Ohio, hands down."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! I will definitely be returning. Quality ingredients. Pleasant staff. Couldn't ask for much more."}
{"text":"We love the pizza and we love the place!!!  An all time favorite when you want to unwind in a very comfortable setting, watch pizza being made, then indulge on your own pizza!!!  Incredible selection of regular and specialty pizzas.  The best bacon ceasar salad ever!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really different and quite good. Thin crust and the ingredients are really high quality and mostly all fresh too. The service is great.  Now for the bad. The pizza ovens are poorly ventilated though so the restaurant it rather smokey. It's often so bad that it makes us think twice about eating here. It can be bad enough to irritate the eyes and breathing if you have asthma. It must be a health hazard for the employees to be exposed to all the smoke every day. They also have Fox News on their TV every time we've been in the place. It's rather annoying.  Get take out."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Northeast Ohio. For thin-crust fans who value hand-tossed pies right before your eyes. This is our weekly family pizza joint. Parking can be REALLY tight."}
{"text":"Great pizza - fresh salads - good service Very pleasant find - thank u yelp - we will be back next visit"}
{"text":"Been looking for great pizza on the west side Found It!!!!! The drives to little Italy for pizza are finally over. Here is a pizza place that gets it, pizza done right. If your looking for bread pizza with no flavor go to any other place on the west side. Trust me I've tried them all, all the top rated by the tv station. Big plus here great beer menu. Oh I gotta tell you my server was a delight great service without being a pest. Check them out, nahhh never mind keep going where your going I'll keep this place for my own."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Fun, family-run feel. They have games like farkle to play while waiting at your table. Very down to earth place :-)"}
{"text":"It has been a while (about 3 months) since my one and only trip to Sweet Basil, but I figured I should write this review now, since it is doubtful that I will be going back anytime soon.   The food, from what I remember, was good. Decent Neapolitan style pizza and standard salad. The drink menu, as I recall, was lackluster...pretty sure they only had soda and a small wine selection. I didn't remember the pizza or salad being anything extraordinary, but it was fine for general pizza eating purposes.     Chaotic would be the best way to describe this place. We went there on a Friday night. Lots of little kids and big families...I think this is the main reason the place did not appeal to me so much. There was a balloon clown. Perhaps Sweet Basil is just not meant for my demographic, and that's fine -- not every place is going to be. Still, the place seemed a bit out of control...someone's child dumped either water or soda with ice all over the floor near the entrance, and nobody was bothering to clean it up during our (very long, I might add) wait to be seated. I had to warn other patrons who were almost about to slip and fall to be careful. I even brought it to the staff's attention, but the spill with slippery ice remained there on the floor for quite a while. (I guess it never occurred to the parents of the child to make the child clean up his own spill, or else clean up after him themselves?)      There were big pictures of the owners' family all over the wall...weird.      Sweet Basil would probably be a good place for takeout. I haven't had their takeout but I could imagine enjoying it a lot more without the quiet din of a hundred young children incessantly babbling. If you have kids and are on the West side of Cleveland, you may want to consider taking them here."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza- has the neopolitan pizza was fresh and awesome. waiters were attentive and food was relatively quick. Definitely will come again ;)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza place in Cleveland. Closest to NY style I've found in the area. Not too sweet sauce. Crispy, chewy crust. Good quality toppings and cheese. The garlic \"not knots\" are delicious as well. Quick, friendly service. Stone oven taste. Foldable. Perfect. I actually had to stop coming here so often b/c I was putting on pizza weight :("}
{"text":"Another great meal! Nice neighborhood place - casual, fam friendly, good food, friendly staff. We often come after spending time at the park  Have eaten in & called ahead for pickup; both have gone smoothly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. We've been several times, and I'm new to Neapolitan. One had a little too much cheese for my taste, but overall great dining and carry out."}
{"text":"I've had this pizza a number of times, but ordered it for take-out myself for the first time last night--that won't happen again. Was left on hold for 7 minutes when I first called, and on calling back, my order was taken immediately, so they obviously just forgot to go back to the calls on hold. When I went to pick the order up, I was essentially ignored by the hostess, she went to the back, and when she came back to the counter, helped the person behind me. I understand these are underskilled high school students working, but if they can't handle answering the phone and helping people who walk up to the counter, it's a huge problem. It's especially a huge problem when the pizza is otherwise delicious. (Love the house dressing too.) There are, however, half a dozen other pizza places in the vicinity and they're all pretty good and they can handle dealing with customers... and most of them deliver."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience here and I've been eating here for years. The pizza itself isn't the usual deep dish heavily loaded down kind. Rather it's lighter with a thin crust. You're given a huge variety of toppings to choose from, everything from traditional toppings to more cosmopolitan ones like roasted garlic, sweet basil, and roasted red peppers. The restaurant itself is nice, usually gets really hot in the summer so dining in may not be that enjoyable. Other than that it's a must try for anyone craving pizza."}
{"text":"Love it, great pizza, great staff! Thank you mike for letting us call our order ahead to feed the kids, everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"I always get pizza here. The crust is excellent and as are the toppings and cheese. The service is friendly as well. I wish there was slightly more parking available but no big deal. Very delicious pizza."}
{"text":"This pizza shop had a great white pizza. Owner was friendly and service was quick. If I had enough dough, I would open my own Sweet Basil."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Owner is super nice!  Customizations are no problem.  Online menu doesn't show the array of wonderful macaroni and cheese variations available.  Try any or all of them!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why a pizzeria decided to put macaroni and cheese on the menu. But damn is it good. Last time I went there my Neapolitan pizza was cooked perfectly, and actually not burnt for once. Seriously, great macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! It's New York style, large foldable pieces! Their Italian sausage is the best, thinly sliced, not sausage \"chunks\" you'll find at other places.  Always consistently good! I've never had a bad pizza here!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm so good! Love their crust, it's the best!  The service is ok, but what do you expect from a bunch of teenagers...  We talked to the owner who is super nice. I guess he used to lead a corporate kind of life...quit his job and opened up this brick oven pizza joint. He uses all local ingredients grown right here in cleveland and the surrounding burbs.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza has no cheese :( and claim to be styled after New Haven pizza... No where close unfortunately. This is a really popular place though so just not my taste I guess?!"}
{"text":"Closest to NYC style in Cleveland. I ate lunch here and was able to get cheese pizza by the slice when I walked in. Warning - I ordered two and they were HUGE. I probably could have just had one slice even tho I was super hungry. They have the consistency of the thin crust just right - firm enough to hold its shape but not crispy like a cracker like the \"New York style\" place in downtown Cleveland. This seems like the real deal and the service was good. I recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor since SBNSP opened and everything's still perfect. Dan and his team make the ultimate pizza for us every single time. I don't know how he does it, but he and his staff work extra hard to make sure we are satisfied. You can't ask for any better than that.  Jim Poe"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.  Great pizza.  I love thin crust and stone oven pizza and these guys do it very well. I also had couple varieties of their Mac&cheese and it was just as good.  Soaking up the liquids with their bread.....yummm. The food is fresh. I love the red sauce.....I can taste tomatoes as well as the herbs.  White pie is just as tasty. Perfect balance of dough sauce cheese and toppings. Service is good. I had eat in as well as carry out.  People who work there are great friendly and make you feel welcome. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable.  Prices are in line with other small pizza places.   I am a frequent visitor...... And will continue to be so."}
{"text":"It's all Nicole's fault! Her ROTD made my mouth water for real NY-Style, thin-crust pizza. And Sweet Basil does it! Finally, I have found a slice that is TRUE to what many claim to be.  Now, I know it's not wood-burning, brick, or what have you, but a specialty oven does not a NY slice make. I DO admit that the so-called \"best\" NY joints, aka the old-school, fresh, specialty shops, do use these ovens. But my favorite pie comes from any run-of-the-mill pizza place on the corner of any street. And those places use a gas oven.   Ok, now that we've gotten that part out of the way ... The place itself, as in the decor, was really nothing special. It was Strip Mall USA. However, I could tell from my first bite to my last that the ingredients are phenomenal and the pies are cooked with great love and admiration for the dough, the tomatoes, the basil, and so on. You can just tell from having a five-minute conversation with this guy that he absolutely loves what he does.  After reading several reviews, I was worried I'd have to order a whole pie (well, let me rephrase that:I wasn't worried, because lord knows I could have polished it off even if it took me a few meals and a couple of days, but it's so nice to have a carefree slice on the go. There's no long wait time, no worrying about taking a box out or anything getting cold). But! Lo and behold, there was a lunch menu with salad/slice, salad/soup, or soup/slice combos, so I went for it.  Let me just say that putting fresh mixed greens, various colors of veggies, and THOUGHT into a house salad does not go unnoticed. And the dressing was insanely good. It was like balsamic vinaigrette on crack.  And the slice. Oh, the slice. Humongous enough, as Nicole said, to do the fork-and-knife thing or the Tony Soprano fold. I chose the fold, and that delicious cheese and sauce got all steamy and puffed out with every bite. This slice needed no garlic salt, no red pepper flakes, no Parmesan cheese, no NOTHING. It was perfect. You can tell that the dough, which was simultaneously soft and crisp, crunchy and chewy, and altogether delicious, only had a few key ingredients and no fillers.  I was waiting all this time for \"The One,\" that perfect slice to remind me of home. I've found it!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here cause I love pizza. Who doesn't?  1. The door to the front door was open and it was 50 degrees. It was freezing in the dining area. 2. The garlic bread tasted like pure butter. No garlic taste at all. 3. The pizza was very bland. It tasted like a can of tomatoes was open and thrown on it. No seasonings at all.  I got the \"The Special Pizza\". It had olives, pepperoni, gyro meat, green peppers, and bacon. The gyro meat was tasteless. I couldn't even tell it was on their till I actually looked at the pizza. 4. The older lady we had as our waitress was not friendly. All she wanted to do was take our order and that's it. She never asked how the food was. I'm sure she is glad she didn't cause it was awful. Honestly, Ive had better pizza at Pizza Hut. I did love the size of the pizza. The crust was ok. I liked the chewy aspect of it."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza available around Westlake.  Though many of the pizzas feature a large number and variety of toppings, the pizza itself is perfect.  Perfect crust, perfect sauce, and a perfect blend of cheeses, the toppings only serve to add to the experience."}
{"text":"Was out shopping tonight with my family and we found Sweet Basil's on Yelp. Based on the other reviewer's recommendations, we stopped in for dinner.   We had two house salads and the house dressing was highly flavorful. We ordered a small half BBQ chicken and  Queen margarite (quite close to a caprese style). I loved the margarite.  My kids unfortunately didn't love the BBQ chicken but primarily because they are more accustomed to Dewey's style.   Overall it was a good experience though. Friendly staff. Good prices.  Game room for the kids after dinner. If you're in the area, it's worth stopping in for."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an old school pizza place with Luigi and Nona flippin' dough in the back room and, \"That's Amore\" blasting from the speakers, this isn't it.  This is a modernized version of a pizzeria with slick, slightly industrial decor and clean lines.  Bravo to Sweet Basil for that.  I only ordered a calzone for lunch.  When I went to pick it up they slid a pizza box across the counter.  Surely it was the wrong order, right?  Nope.  Tucked inside was the most MASSIVE calzone I've ever seen.  No joke it had to be `12\" long by 9\" wide.  Perfectly constructed.  And I loved how I could customize my calzone (which means they make them to order...awesome).  I ordered it with sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, and extra sauce and it already came with a mixture of ricotta, mozzarella, and romano.  I thought the red sauce needed salt. sad to say.  It was kinda boring and borderline tasteless.  Dough was thin and chewy.  All in, it cost $11.  Good quality ingredients for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and our Server couldn't have been any friendlier, attentive or accommodating.  They are incredibly flexible as to doing half and half, adding or deleting toppings, etc.    The dining room is a little stark, but has the bare bones to be a beautiful restaurant.  The pies (huge NY style) are so good, that the additional investment would be worthwhile.   Their specialty pizzas are creative and well crafted, even offering chalkboard specials of 5+ pizzas of the day.  The open kitchen was attractive and very clean.  The complimentary scoop of lemon ice at the end was a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I live a stone's throw away from Little Italy and have tried all the respective pizza restaurants in that neighborhood, and we still routinely make the 30 minute drive out to Sweet Basil because I think it is truly some of the best pizza in Cleveland.   The slices are huge, but don't taste overly heavy or doughy. The ingredients are fresh and the seasoning is perfection. Two slices are enough for one person as dinner. The atmosphere feels a little bit more upscale and \"farm to table\" than your normal pizza joint and is a great place to share a pie with friends or family! Their takeout service is prompt and easy as well!"}
{"text":"Sweet Basil is a bit of a trip for us considering we live in Brunswick but man is it worth it. I love thin NY style pie and this is the real deal. Our go to pizza is simple...it's the Neapolitan...this time we added onions and it was better than ever. My in-laws tried the eggplant parm pizza and loved it! Life is too short to waste on bad 'Za so I highly recommend making a stop at Sweet Basil...you will not be disappointed. The service was excellent which made the experience all that much better.  Side note: they have a game room with air hockey, skeeball, pinball, and video games to keep the kiddies entertained while waiting on your pizza. All I can say is that I wish we could get here more often. The pizza is the best in CLE imho. Kudos Sweet Basil...and thanks for another great experience."}
{"text":"Love a thin, hand-tossed crust? This is your place. I haven't been here in years, but a pizza-loving friend hadn't tried it yet so I brought her. I had the calzone and she had a pepperoni pizza. She said it was the best pizza she has ever had. My calzone was excellent with real crushed tomatoes and just the right mix of shredded cheese and ricotta. It's a little more costly, but die to the size of the pizza and quality of the ingredients, it's well-priced.  They play country music which I enjoyed as well. The place does a nice business and had a lot of families eating in on this Saturday evening. The kids get dough to play with which was fun to watch them all out it on their faces as noses or mustaches."}
{"text":"Seriously not a bad pizza for being in the land where there is no good pizza. CLEVELAND. Threw a hot wing in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I dropped by the other day because I was in the area. After seeing the \"pizza by the slice\" sign, I figured I'd try two slices and see how it was, since it had been at least three years since last having their pizza, and I wasn't starving.   I ordered one topping, which was garlic. I *love* garlic. I guess I expected regular-defined as \"normal,\"sized pizza slices. But I was pleasantly surprised when I got a regular-sized pizza box and saw that the TWO slices took up practically THE ENTIRE BOX. These slices were that large. I was very pleased! The New York style pizza is wonderful and I will be back ."}
{"text":"In an area that is overwhelmingly saturated with the bland and flavorless national chain shops Sweet Basil is an oasis for my tastebuds.  This place serves up some amazing pizzas!  And holy cow are the slices huge!  I'm a big eater and had my fill after 2 slices!    Freshness of ingredients is what sets this place apart.  The dough is freshly made, the sauce is wonderful, and the cheese is REAL.  You won't find the processed cheese food product stuff being used here.  It's all 100% awesome romano and mozzarella.  The crust is nice and thin, but still has a bit of that chewy doughy thing going for it.  When you add on the sauce, cheese, and any number of their wonderful toppings you'll never go back to the crappy McPizza Shack again."}
{"text":"This was a nice little eatery with an arcade in the back. It was fairly uncrowded for a Friday which was great. Nice family atmosphere. The pizza I had was thin crust and was just enough to share without leftovers. The breadsticks were good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, it's solid pizza. AWESOME people / service. I would return, for sure - if I'm in the area.   With all the \"New York\" pizza talk I think it set me up for disappointment - it is not New York pizza. It's good for the area though, so I'll give it that - it's just you can't really say \"New York\" pizza."}
{"text":"OMGoodness! Yummy! I love thin pizza that's not too crispy or burnt. I love the menu and pizza. Family friendly, video games and alcohol. Our family is tired of chain-pizza places. The servers are quick and friendly. The kids love to watch the cooks toss and spend n the dough."}
{"text":"Loved stopping in here yesterday for a late lunch. The website made me want to have a slice of pizza!  Plenty of parking outside and they have a cool logo gigantic beach chair in front.  Indoor is bright and comforting... tables and a sports bar corner with tv.    You get greeted the minute you walk in by friendly people.   Our slices of pizza were hand crafted and freshly made in minutes for us.    You can customize your own.   We planned to take ours to go so they put in boxes but I had to start eating my slice on the spot. Huge slice. .. thin crust and flat neopolitan yummy style.  Lots of garlic and full of flavor. The owner is super nice and attentive with a go go go mentality.   Seems like all the locals like him and his food.   They actually do catering for lunches Which is great.  Great casual dining restaurant for lunch or dinner.   Bring the family!  I will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent Margarite pizza. Almost as good as Gentile's.  Best eaten in the restaurant as I don't believe it tastes nearly as good if I do a take out order.  Price is reasonable and staff friendly and efficient.  Who knew an Irishman could make such a fantastic pizza?  This place is proof it can be done, and done expertly.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing is an understatement. Never had a pie I didn't like. My first choice for pizza on the west side of Cleveland. It's a bit pricey ($45 for two large pizzas!) but actually worth the cost. You must try the roasted goat!"}
{"text":"One of the best pepperoni, jalapeño and anchovies pizza I have ever had. Coupled with a Goose Island IPA - perfection!  Crust was perfectly thin and the sauce was not too sweet.  Atmosphere is very casual.  There's a game room for kids."}
{"text":"DECIDEDLY AVERAGE  Our family group of 9 came in for dinner based in part on the high Yelp reviews. The pizzas were poor to average. The salads were sub-par and the service was lousy. Why all the good reviews? Is the competition really that bad by comparison?  And Faux News was on the TV. I'm sorry, but that's one demerit!"}
{"text":"I have been by this place many times, but have never stopped until tonight.  I had \"The Special\" pizza and house salad. The house salad dressing is a balsamic based dressing that was wonderful. The pizza was a very thin crust, with an amazing amount of toppings.   We only ordered the 12 inch, which was served with a wire rack on the table. Others in the restaurant were getting the 18 inch, which they serve on a luggage rack, because it is so big.  I was expecting more of an Italian feel to the inside, however, found it to be very modern.  The only negative is the price. I thought the salad was very reasonably priced, but the pizzas are a little pricey, however they are loaded with toppings.   I would diffidently go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first time going to Sweet Basil in Westlake. I was greeted, there was quick service, the interior looked nice, I was pleased in that regard. The pizza I got was an artichoke basil pesto pizza....a white pie pizza. I wasn't all that impressed, paid $16 for it. I'm not the biggest fan of thin crust pizza but the flavor and texture wasn't all that great either. I may try it again at another time, but I wasn't impressed with the product."}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland for over 20 years and have intentionally tried many, many restaurants looking for the best pizza. Of course, all reviews are subjective however let me say that in my humble opinion: Sweet Basil has the best pizza in the area. Period. If you love a great New York style pizza and expect excellent service, Sweet Basil is the place to go.  Plus, they have a pretty decent beer selection."}
{"text":"I had a really rough week at work and decided to treat myself to some pizza. I ordered on the road from Beachwood and it took me about 30 minutes to get there which should have been perfect timing but the reality was much different than the expectation. I waited for an hour in the restaurant (time since order was placed 90 minutes) before someone handed me my pizza which apparently had been ready for quite some time but according to the cashier \"someone forgot to check that I had paid\". I don't like complaining especially not to kids who have no control over what went wrong but I wanted them to know if been standing there for an hour so while fighting back tears of frustration I told the girl who handed me the pizza I'd been here a really long time and she assured me if I ordered again and gave my name they'd make it right. I really don't know how that's gonna work since she didn't write it down but I'll update if something does happen. The pizza while lukewarm was excellent hence 2 stars"}
{"text":"Be warned, this is not New York style thin crust pizza, slices definitely are not foldable, though it's not pan pizza. In addition, the sauce just seems to be crushed tomatoes. The cheese was decent, and the toppings are generous; I ordered garlic, and it must have been super finely chopped, because no pieces were visible.  To be fair, this might be the best pizza in Cleveland, but I am not a local and wanted decent pizza."}
{"text":"good place, though it's usually empty when I've stopped in at lunch. big slices, very tasty, drink refills, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have definitely been to a lot of local pizza places in strip mall like areas wherever I get to travel. The Sweet Basil Neapolitan Style Pizzeria definitely stands out to occupy a special place in my mind.  More than the pizzas or food itself, you cannot miss their gigantic wooden chair near the entrance.  I thought it to be a pretty cool and attractive stuff. I of course, did manage to sit on it and have a couple of snaps taken by my friends. Should be a fun thing to do for the kids - other than the eating itself.  The inner layout of the store was pretty neat. One side tucked away with the kitchen and counter area and a sprawling dining space for the rest.  A good chunk of the seating was for a minimum of 4 people and the fact that the seating area was large - with tall seats also being available clearly indicated they are as much a dine-in family place as they are a take out.  The noise level of the place was slightly less than the average. Do not be surprised at songs that are a 10 year old being played out for you to recall.  Alright, moving onto the real main item - the pizza. This is the first place where the thin crust was not so thin that it felt as if you were just eating cheese and toppings. We had a thin crust margarita pizza. The tomatoes were evidently freshly cut ones and placed POST the baking of the cheese with basil and other herbs, leaving it with a unique taste of the raw and cooked at the same time. Every slice was truly an out of the world taste, when downed with the ample oregano, grated cheese and chilli flakes at the table.  While waiting on your pizzas, if you will, you can go a little backdoor and there is a whole play area out there. There were some pretty older DOS based games if you will, on the play terminals setup there. Standard stuff. But definitely looked pretty overused and requiring some make over as well."}
{"text":"About time they have a family pizza place where you can sit and enjoy awesome pizza.  The place just impressed me, I love it!  The owner came and talked to us and was very helpful in helping us plan our 3yr old daughters party there. The pizza making show they put on is great also. It was cool how they gave my daughter a piece of dough to play with. It was like playdo but neater and natural. The pizza was huge and I couldn't get enough. Yummm, I'll be back soon.  Before I finish the review I wanted to say the arcade room was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Sweet Basil offers a wide variety of thin crust pizzas.  I ordered the Screaming Demon (minus tomatoes), which is their White Pie, plus chicken, bacon, and a pesto/alfredo drizzle.  The pizza came out pretty quickly and was hot when it arrived at our table.  The pizza was great and the combination of toppings was perfect.  That being said, I felt like it could have used a little more sauce, etc.  The crust was definitely the most prominent part of the meal.  It is good pizza and a lot of varieties.  The atmosphere is casual, so it is a great place to stop in on a whim.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Most overrated,overpriced pizza place in town & I love NY style pizza. Go to Capri pizza instead"}
{"text":"Big and Delicious, New York style pizza, you can taste the fresh ingredients in every bite. Mine (the Neapolitan) had lots of fresh basil, crushed tomatoes and garlic. The crust was thin with a lightly chard, crunchy chewy crust . The slices where so big you had to fold them to eat them, just like in NY. I relize there are different taste and preferences out there, but this is the kind of pie to go for if you like a good NY style pizza."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and got some food to go last night. The sausage and pepperoni pizza (we built our own) was great, as were the original mac and cheese and garlic \"not\" knots. The service was great, even though it was nearly closing time. Excited to go back and try more options in the future!"}
{"text":"Awesome Neapolitan-style pizza with an owner that stands behind his product.  I accidentally caused my pizza to fall on the floor & they replaced it, no charge.  Waitress was also great, friendly and provided top-notch service.  Highly recommend this local Westlake business!"}
{"text":"A great local pizzeria. We ate in for a late lunch and had a really nice time. Service was friendly and efficient, and I especially liked the artichoke pizza. The food seemed very fresh and homemade. They also do take-out."}
{"text":"Don't order the pasta for the price point. It's insanely overpriced. We actually refused to pay for the half order of pesto mac and cheese add chicken because, for $7, it looked like a 4 oz. portion! I felt like I could make a $1 box of mac and cheese that would taste better.  And, onto the pizza, we ordered a large half special, half chicken bacon pizza with extra sauce all over. We paid extra for the extra sauce, but couldn't find it. Should have asked for it on the side so we know we get what we paid for. The server said it would take 15-20 minutes yet when we arrived and paid, the pizza was lukewarm. Darn!  If you live in the area it's a decent place amongst all others in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing thin pizza, everything tasted so fresh, I will absolutely be back! The waitress was super friendly and the place looks very clean inside. This is a must."}
{"text":"SOO yummy! This pizza crust is definitely worth the trip. Add the some simple basil or cheese and you gots yourself a great dinner. I tried a cheese and a basil pizza, both thin crust. Both excellent."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment sums up my dine in here for dinner today with my wife. I want my daily calories back and the $40 that I had to spend on a small pizza, small salad, garlic not knots and two drinks. The only reason I did not give one star is because their salad dressing was actually good. The pizza had hardly any flavor. We ordered the small Special which was $17.00(by the way nothing special about this dry flavorless pizza).The garlic not \"knots\" were 4 small bread strips which were just okay for $4.75 that's almost a $1.20 per tiny strip of bread. The salad was good. They charge 75 cents per topping on the salad. We ordered mozzarella cheese a received a small little bit of cheese but their house dressing was tasty. All I can say is I will not come back here and think that your basic chain pizza company is more enjoyable. And for anyone who thinks this is close to NYC pizza is out of their mind. I travel to NYC for work at least once a month and this does not even come close."}
{"text":"This is what pizza is meant to be.  I know they say New York style (which it is) but that is the closest to what pizza is supposed be.  Nice, thin but structurally sound crusts with a nice crisp bite and lengthy chew.  Then come the toppings.  A sauce that supports the pie but doesn't overwhelm it and the quality cheese and toppings make it harmonious pie.  I have traveled all over and have tried real za from the homeland and this is by far the best in Cleveland in my book.  Mama Santa's is next on the list.  A must go for a great pizza.  Just wish you were closer!"}
{"text":"Danny has done the Westside a favor. He works hard and has a great pizza.  The place is small but he makes it work.  The smell from the burning flour from the pizza oven is the only thing that needs fixed.  The food is very good."}
{"text":"One of the best sit down pizza places in the area! The pizza is thin crust style and huge! They offer a variety of flavors and the option to customize your own. They also have several beer options. The price is moderate and the staff is friendly. The only downfall is the often slow service. It's small inside, so you might have to wait for a table on a busy Friday or Saturday evening. Overall, great place to grab a drink and pizza."}
{"text":"What a great little place! The thin crusts are fantastic and the selection of toppings and sauces is quite diverse.  It will take many visits to even decide which of their pizzas is my favorite!  Tonight I tried the Grapes of Wrath white pizza with grape tomatoes, cheese, fresh basil, garlic, and balsamic vinaigrette.  I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"big pizza. lol.  really big pizza. very thin crust.  lots of different choices. i tried the gyro and thought it was super good. i think this restaurant is inside an old dairy mart building or something. so the inside is not really that nice. i think they could have done better with the decorations. i felt almost like a cafeteria setting, if that makes sense.  i would probably recommend carry out vs. dining in. (which i have done numerous times)  not my favorite pizza place, but definitely not the worse that i have had either."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've tried in the area... the piadine is the BOMB but then again so is everything else. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Words can't accurately describe how much I look forward to Sweet Basil pizza nights. Half eggplant parm, half queen marguerite and I am ready to party. Even just plain cheese is delicious- it's crisped to perfection. My only complaint is that delivery isn't available to Lakewood from their Westlake location, but it's worth the special drive. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"Got duped into coming here again.   Once again horrible service. Wife waited for 5 min before being greeted. Or another way of putting it she was ignored for 5 min. Servers are quite good at the drop and run leaving you no time to ask a question or ask for the missing silverware or refill. Then they disappear for 10 min.   Our pizza, on the stand next to the table, was bumped into 4 times. Their us just no room in the place. Perhaps instead of putting a bar that no one uses you could spread the tables out a little.   The place is dirty. Bathrooms are unkept and the giant bag of rock salt on the bench is a nice touch. It adds to the scummy feel along with missing photos on the wall and exposed wiring.   And don't get me started with the open front door. I know it is a warm winter but is not 70 degrees out. CLOSE THE DOOR. Were you born in a barn?   I wish a good pizza place would open in Westlake."}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant 2 stars is really upsetting. The pizza was great but the service was absolutely terrible. After receiving my food, I did not see my waitress for 45 minutes. I waited for a refill and for a box. The manager eventually came over to see if I needed anything and he never even returned with a box. The only way I'd consider eating their pizza again is if I got it to go."}
{"text":"Yeah, I get it. They fling the dough up in the air to stretch it out. By appearance alone, it seemed authentic. But don't the pizzerias in the mall do the same? Yeah, it beats the frozen disks as used by Pizza Hut and Papa John's I imagine. Let's just not get carried away folks. The praise I've been reading about this place has been off the charts. I was curious if it could withstand the hype...  Sweet Basil has been on my places to try list for quite some time. I've heard comparisons to Crostata's in Highland Heights. Now that I find myself trolling the Western side of town more-so these days than the Eastside, I figured the timing was perfect to check out this much heralded pizza joint.  It was Friday night. Approximately 7pm. Pizza was on my mind. We headed to the dreaded 'burb of Westlake to check out this pie. Sweet Basil was stuck in a strip mall along Center Ridge Road. Who has more strip malls by the way? Westlake or Strongsville? My God there's a lot of brick in these cities!   Inside, it was chaotic. The dining room shared the same space as the kitchen. It was basically one big room packed to the brim with loud kids and families. I wasn't sure a calm meal could be enjoyed in this atmosphere. It seemed more like a Chuck E. Cheese than a restaurant, so we ordered a pie to go. To kill time and protect our sanity, we waited it out at a bar on the other end of the strip mall, called \"Time Warp Bar\". More on that in another review....  We ordered two pies. The \"Queen Margarite\" (tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, garlic) along with the \"Special\" (sausage, ground sirloin, bacon, olives, onion, pepper, garlic, mushrooms, romano and mozzarella).  For dessert, two cannolis. The pies were both acceptable. Thin crust, nicely proportioned toppings, did the trick. A far cry from Crostata's though. Not even in the same league actually. The pizza isn't even cooked in a wood burning oven. If I hear one more comparison to Crostata's, I might flip. Better than the chains? Sure. Among the best in greater Cleveland? Meh. It might crack the Top 10."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. True NY style crust. Good place to take the family. We love coming here anytime we feel like pizza and we are too lazy to cook at home. Definitely my favorite pizza place since I don't work downtown CLE anymore and don't get to go to Vincenza's."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. Cause it is a great place.  We have eaten there a couple of times.  First was when they hadn't even finished opening up.  The floor wasn't even finished!  It was really good the first time, so we went back for a second and third.  The pizza is great.  The atmosphere is great. The service is great Nd very friendly.  They even let the kids watch them make the pizzas and toss to them a small ball of pizza dough for them to play with.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for NY style pizza on Cleveland, Sweet Basil is the place to go. To get the true feel of a fold over thin crust piece you must order the large. It's a lot of pizza, but great for lunch the next day! The experience is wonderful, watching the pizza dough being hand tossed. There are bar stools sitting at the pizza bar and the kids love watching!   Our favorite is the Neapolitan. Wonderful fresh ingredients!!   We've experienced slow service at times, with what seems like confusion on who is responsible for what. But the pizza is definitely worth the confusion!   A must visit when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We stopped there on this past Saturday night with the family....it was about 7:30 pm.....the place was a madhouse.....screaming kids everywhere....birthday party heaven, very loud and noisy but we really like the pizza so we stayed.  The cashier/hostess at the front desk basically ignored us, told us there was a ait list....another person told us there was not........eventually got seated, and ordered.......once we ordered the pizza was fairly quick in coming.....,.but getting the order taken was another thing.......  pizza was great....loved it.......then the same hostess/cashier checked me out....basically told me it would be a while because she was having \"issues: with the credit card machine....waitied for a bit then she turned to me and said....\" what do you want.......\"  OMG....please........hope this type of thing does not ruin a place with great pizza......."}
{"text":"I had Sweet Basil with my family the other night for dinner. I unfortunately have a gluten sensitivity so gluten free it is for me! I actually thought the gluten free pizza was pretty decent. The crust was on the crisper side which I actually liked. It wasn't very greasy at all. The sauce had a nice flavor and seasonings. I would definitely eat it again. My family got an order of the garlic knots, the Meatlovers and the King's Mistress which they seemed to like."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, salads and friendly service with a smile are all reasons we keep going back. We really haven't had a pizza here that we didn't like! It's a thinner crust, so keep that in mind. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review after my second visit to Sweet Basil's. It was one of those experiences better digested after two visits versus one. Sweet Basil's gets a lot of business by word of mouth and reviews in the paper for being Neapolitan style pizza. I think it is more east coast pie meats (ha I play on words) California pizza.   Each time I have visited, which were weekend evenings, the restaurant has been very busy. The atmosphere is very Chicky cheese, yet the modern color selections, granite table tops, cool pendant lighting, loft style ceiling seems to be aiming for a different crowd. Yet, It is a very family oriented and lacks atmosphere. Ever been to Marotta's on Lee? Sweet Basil's is a 180 degree switch in feeling.   The food. Pizza is better than average but not a tribute by any means to Neapolitan pizza. No wood oven. Cased closed. East coast pizza..you bet. The pizza, or pie as the owner calls it, is quite large, has good texture and the quality toppings are much appreciated. The house made salad dressing is to die for, we even bought some to take home. Quality salads, quality pizza toppings, and quality pizza. Just NOT Neapolitan pizza. Wine and beer is served BUT extremely limited in selection and quality.   Service is OK. Servers are very young. So young, in fact on our second visit, she couldn't even carry out our wine and beer. She has to wait on someone else to do it. The second visit also had a pizza mishap where in our party, one couple had their pizza \"accidentally\" delivered to the wrong table. So our pizza arrived first, very cold. The owner and servers were very apologetic about our friends pizza and brought out a piping hot one 10 minutes later. 2 problems, ours was cold and theirs was very late. Nothing was done to rectify this situation not a comped beer, discount, free dessert, nada. Not that we were looking for freebies, but we all know..it is the thought that counts.   The pizza is good. I wouldn't drive across town for it. If you are in the neighborhood, it would be worth your time. I do appreciate when a restaurateur puts effort in delivering a good quality product, even if it is marketed incorrectly ;-)"}
{"text":"Sweet Basil is the real deal. Large hand tossed foldable slices of pizza goodness. They use crushed tomatoes instead of sauce which makes the pizza so light and easy to eat. We always get pepperoni but there are many excellent toppings and specialty pizzas to choose from. They also have salads, and recently added Mac and Cheese and a few other non pizza options. There is a small game room though I've never been inside and a small selection of craft beers, wines and cocktails.  Togo beer is also an option in 6 packs and the pizza tastes just as good as take out. One of our favorite pizza places in Cleveland and well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"One of the few local pizza places that does a great thin crust. They have a bunch of tasty house pies, or you can simply build your own. The toppings are fresh and contain some nice upscale options like prosciutto. Salads are a fine accompaniment- no iceberg lettuce here. Good beer selection and decent wine. Very family friendly and very loud at times, but you can always take it to go."}
{"text":"My general perception of thin crust pizza: A cracker that barely supports it's scant toppings. I want some deep dish dough loaded with ALL the toppings! But my friend enjoys the thin crust lifestyle and recommended we stop into Sweet Basil.   For a Wednesday evening, the place had a good size crowd and the waitress gave us a warm welcome when we walked in and instructed us to sit wherever we'd like. Soooo I found myself facing a large picture of two babies in the booth we chose... I get that it's a family place, but maybe save the oversized family pictures for an office area, or at home?   Anyways, when I got over the freaky-huge kid pictures, we ordered a large pizza for two people, and split it half pesto artichoke, and half a custom made pepperoni, basil, and garlic. My hungry tummy was very happy when the huge pizza was brought out to our table. Each slice was about a foot in length! The pie was decorated with a decent portion of toppings too! It smelled delicious and tasted equally delicious. I really enjoyed the pesto and artichoke. The artichokes were baked to have a crisp exterior, but tender inside. Thumbs up Sweet Basil. Thank you for not making thin crust pizza a cracker!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great! I order by the slice as one slice is equivalent to three of your regular size slices. Great atmosphere! Great pizza!"}
{"text":"If you like 'Neapolitan Style' pizza, this is the place to go!  The homemade tomato sauce and mozzarella tastes (and is) fresh, and the thin crust is excellent.  While there, I met the owner, Dan, who is clearly passionate about pizza, and a helluva nice guy all around.   I understand that although he was born and bred here, he spent many years living in the NY/NJ/CT area (my old 'stomping grounds'), and brought back some of that tri-state area pizza making magic back with him!  All we NE Ohio pizza lovers are all the more lucky for it!"}
{"text":"Overall good pizza, fresh toppings, good sauce.  Not a huge fan of the standard crust they offer but the toppings make up for it.  The vegetarian specialty pizza has stood out as my favorite of their specialities that I have tried so far.  I would give 3.5 stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"Decent pizza -- not phenomenal, but decent. Pretty bland atomosphere. It's in a strip mall and feels like it's in a strip mall.  My biggest complaint is that the pizza is served tableside on racks, which makes navigating through the restaurant (to and from the restrooms, for example) a little dodgy. As in you are dodging pizzas! Just a little awkward."}
{"text":"I HATE Cleveland \"pizza.\" I also hate Chicago casser- ...pizza. I love sweet basil! I'm from north jersey, been here 5 years and discovered sweet basil about 2 years ago. I can't believe I never reviewed it!   They ARE a little pricey for pizza, but then again I'm from nj, so they're cheap compared to any place there. Either way, completely worth it. Best Neapolitan pizza in neo, hands down. I'd be proud to serve this pizza at home... And we know pizza."}
{"text":"When it first opened, Sweet Basil was my 'go to' pizza place.  The pizza was flavorful and used high quality ingredients.  You would walk in to see dough being thrown and a smiling face, but the last two times have been an utter disappointment.  The first I chalked up to a bad night but it repeated and seems to be standard.  For a small salad and 12 inch pepperoni and mushroom, I was charged $23.  There was a total of 8 pepperoni and small bits of mushrooms.  Further insult to injury was a lack of cheese but strangely a lot of grease.  It was enough to make the two of us not hungry...but not for very long.  The sauce was good and seemed high quality but the price and lack of toppings made me feel ripped off.  I should have gone to fatheads and got twice the pizza for half the price.  Skip this place unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service. A true gem out of the sea of pizza places in Cleveland. Queen Marguerite is my fav as is the Mac and cheese and salads. Yay for wine and beer there too!"}
{"text":"This pizza was great and the service was fantastic. We ordered an 18\" half and half pizza. One half was \"The Special\" and the other half was \"Mr Jay.\" Neither one lacked toppings. This pizza was loaded and therefore I felt like it was well worth the money. I loved \"The Special!\" The \"Mr Jay\" was good as well but I was hoping for more of a kick from the Siracha Ranch Drizzle. Both pizzas were really good and I would order it again. My only complaint is that near the end of the crust you can taste the char from the stone oven a little bit. I wouldn't let that keep you from going though. It really wasn't a huge deal since it was only near the ends of the outer crust and only in spots, not the entire crust. If it wasn't for that this place would easily earn my 5 star pizza king stamp. I should note that I haven't had many pizzas cooked in a stone oven so this could very well be normal and if it is I apologize.   Special shout out to our server. I think her name was Kelsey. She had her hands full and appeared to be the only server there. She was zipping to all the tables and even delivering pizzas to the bar next door but she never missed a beat! Our glasses never ran empty and we had everything we needed. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations. I wish every server was that good.   In conclusion this is a great place with great food and in our case, outstanding service. I highly recommend it! The pizzas are HUGE! Get over there and test your appetite!"}
{"text":"First time ordering take out. Went in to place the order, girls behind the counter were super friendly.  Pricing was typical of pizza places in the area. Slices of pizza, HUGE! Several options to choose from. Ordered a large (for two people), overload. But so worth it.  Two things that I would change or want done differently, one is the pizza be a little crispier on the bottom. And the balsamic dressing was super tart. But that was my decision. Otherwise we will be back for sure. The girls behind the counter spoke very highly of the owner so that tells me a lot about how they are treated and respected as employees."}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent. Hand tossed thin crust crispy on the outside chewy on the inside.  Tomato sauce tastes like tomatoes.  Excellent, friendly service"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious pizza!! Thin crust, my favorites are cheese and Frank Pepe's Fresh Tomato Pie. They have tables and booths but I've only done take-out. Service was great! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! The white clam pizza is amazing! Love the thin crust pizza here. Service is great and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service and great pizza. Went there with the family for my birthday and the food was delicious. They also have a game room with an air hockey table and other things for the kiddos to keep them occupied."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizza, Sweet Basil's is a good choice. We have been there 4 times or so in the past year. The pizza is good to very good. Salads are only OK. The location is unpretentious yet inviting and open. It is very family friendly which we appreciate but at times that can lead to it being a bit noisy so I would not recommend it as a place to linger for conversation or as a location for a quiet dinner for two."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza place on the west side and it's still good, but our last visit wasn't as good as I remember it being. We got 1/2 gyro and 1/2 meat and the meat one was really tasty. The gyro on the other hand wasn't nearly as good as I remember.   The pizza is very large  and you can tell it is of high quality."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza junkie. This place is the real deal. Huge, thin crust pizzas that can be make half&half so you can try two different menu options...yum! I always order extra so I have some to heat up at home in the oven."}
{"text":"We took the family there for my sons birthday and he (and we) loved it. The food was great. The salad came a home made balsamic dressing that everyone liked. The pizza was thin and super fresh.   Dan, owner?, gave them pizza dough to play with/make there on pizzas. He then broke out a dough like, practice pizza. He taught them how to toss the dough. I'd definitely go back and recommend it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other yelpers- this ain't no crostatas.  It was a late Sunday night and we were craving pizza. Let's go get pizza! And off we went.   We ordered the Queen Margarite and a special that had shrimp on it. Both were just okay- they were definitely very flat..and iono...just didn't have that same taste as Crostatas. It wasn't oily or anything like that.. I mean, it was good....but not great. Definitely not great. I think I would have preferred Pizzabogo over this place. It was just very flat, think crust, not even doughy or crispy..but kinda floppy pizza.  Definitely not in the same league as Crostatas...but just average. They had a lot of cool brews though- except they were out of the one that we wanted. Sad. Nonetheless...it was pretty average..."}
{"text":"Some areas have local pizza joints. Westlake has the holy grail of pizza places. If you haven't been here, you should. If you have, you know exactly what I am talking about.   Super fresh ingredients, a family atmosphere, and top notch customer service are the standard here. Every experience I have had here was as great as the food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite style of pizza-- thin crust, goodly amount of sauce, fresh mozzarella (not provolone-bleh) and fresh toppings. It reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy-- fresh and perfectly balanced. If you think that Mama Santa's or Joey's is the ne plus ultra of pizza, try this and reevaluate. It's not canned or burnt!   The restaurant is modern, pleasant and spare, filled with families and couples. The staff is friendly, but does not hover. They make the pizza from scratch when you order, so expect to wait about 15 minutes or so. NB, the only starter is a substantial salad. I wish they had something else to nibble on during the wait. They do have games you can play!   The pizza came straight from the oven. Most patrons used a fork and knife (Toronto style!) to eat the first few bites of the enormous slices. Some did the NYC fold. We had the Neapolitan pie. The crust itself was flavorful. The sauce had a lot of texture, and was not too salty. No excessive gobs of cheese. They did use a flaming boatload of fresh garlic, so if you plan to make out with anyone afterward, make sure he/she has eaten just as much as you have, or ask them to go light on the garlic."}
{"text":"I got pizza here for the first time and it tasted like barf!  I got the neopaltin and something else I can't remeber I thought after seeing these reviews it would be good but there went $30!"}
{"text":"The Neapolitan is the bomb. Get a small and a salad and house dressing. Help is great. Owner is a good dude. Good atmosphere. They stock cupcakes from Great Scott's. Or everyone gets a junior cup of lemon Italian ice."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza on the West Side, which doesn't say much, but it would compete on the East Side.  The owner is a great guy...  Don't know what else to say other than great pizza."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I've had in Cleveland.  Dreaming of a good slice of pizza (prefer NY style over Chicago deep dish, but if it's good, it's good either way) I embarked on a best-pizza-in-Cleveland journey with my trusty sidekick.   First stop: Mama santa's: worst excuse for pizza ever, disgusting, and disappointing.  Second stop: Guy's pizza co.: *sigh* what is this world coming to?  Well, I guess it's decent for a chain. Okay.  Time to get serious. Angelo's, Crust, Sainatos, Marottas, Dewey's Pizza...were all pretty good. But Sweet Basil...oh sweet Sweet Basil Pizza was the best out of all the aforementioned.  The meat lover's pizza had, well, ample meat, was well seasoned, cheesy, saucy, all atop a thin, but not too thin, crispy crust.  Oh sweet basil, I've found the best pizza in Cleveland!   AND this is a no fuss, no mess, no snob place.  Come one, come all, with your granny or your crying babies.  It's great pizza, period.  Edit: woah! Just went to Vero's (east side) and that is now the top of the list for yummy pizza."}
{"text":"What's not to like about fresh ingredients, homemade dough, and the warmth of a pizza oven permeating through the dining room? This place is a little slice of heaven for westsiders. I dined here with my parents over the weekend, and we ordered a large pizza to share. My family expressed doubt as to whether or not a large would feed us all, but we even had leftovers. This pizza is delicious; the crust has a nice crunch with still being doughy and the toppings are plentiful. We ordered a pizza with meatball, onion, pepper, and mushroom. The meatballs are sliced thin and make an awesome pizza addition. The sauce was a nice balance of tangy/sweet, and the freshness of the tomatoes really came through. For dessert, they offer cupcakes from a local bakery,  and they are to die for!  My mother and I split one, and it was almost too large to finish. The service was fine and prompt, but the plates came out a bit dirty. It was nothing that wasn't easily fixed. If you are looking for a new way to enjoy pizza, look no further."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of those foods where everyone has their own preference. Over time I've become one to love a thinner base with a crust that has the right amount of air pockets. If you're on board with that pizza, you have to check out Sweet Basil.  By far one of the best out there we make it a point to get here biweekly at least, it's that good. The dough has a great flavor you can taste when cooked as well as the perfect rise. The sauce is a great balance of crushed tomatoes and the right amount of basil. The cheese just ties it all together. What's surprising is after even two large slices, you don't feel weighed down because it's such a great flavor combo without a heavy dough.   Our go to is the 18\" pepperoni and the second is one we try off the specialities. Though their specialties really make some great pizza (Check out the herbed goat if you love goat cheese), we always come back to the pepperoni. Can't beat the basics.   If the ingredients and bake sound like your kind of pizza, you have to make it to Sweet Basil. You won't even make it through the first pizza without planning your next trip."}
{"text":"Try being open some time, dumb fucks. I went there a couple times last year and the kitchen was closed before nine at night. Yesterday I stopped by at 11:30 am. They are open at that time. Like three days a week. Tuesdays, nope. What stupid shit is that? Don't think I'm going to bother coming here any more. Shame, cuz I like the pie a lot. But quirky schedules really piss me off. Plus Westlake sucks in general."}
{"text":"Defininately better than your average pizza chain. Good tasty crackery thin crust. Good beer selection although i did not see any IPAs on the list not that i would order an IPA anyway they are typically stale. I did appreciate the Goose Island selections. I will probably return but will create my own pizza combination next time. We had the barbecue chicken pizza and the gyro pizza. The barbecue chicken was average, not very memorable and the gyro pizza had too much tzatziki sauce. Service was quick, polite and clean."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places. The Frank Pepe pizza has a thin, crisp crust and tomato sauce bursting with flavor. It always arrives steaming hot. Try the house-made Greek dressing on a fresh greens salad. Wonderful. Service here has always been warm, kind and efficient."}
{"text":"Superb !  Best pizza between Boston and Chicago (and beyond actually)  - not far from the highways when traveling.  We will stop every time we drive through the area."}
{"text":"Loved sweet basil pizza! Can we say huuuuge pizzas?! Their sauce is delicious!! Awesome atmosphere with separate dining and game area. They have a great beer and spirits selection. Even though the wine selection isn't great, their tasty margarita overshadowed it. Can't wait to go back and try one of their speciality pizzas!"}
{"text":"Tied for best NY style pizza in Cleveland (with Vincenza's downtown). Great variety and fantastic pies every time! I'd order twice as much if they delivered!"}
