{"text":"I made a huge (lazy) mistake tonight. I wanted a drive thru so I went to the place accross the street instead. AWFUL! I shoulda gotten off my butt to walk in and get the chimichanga I deserve(& for a lower price) from Amando Bros! Don't make the mistake I made. Walk into this restaurant & enjoy!"}
{"text":"good food for the price. I like their new location. They used to be in the little building across the street (north side of Southern). I have not been disappointed with any dish.  Better chips and salsa would make this place a 5, but maybe that's how they keep the prices down."}
{"text":"My regular lunch spot!  Great food and service!  Never had any problems.  Restaurant is clean and friendly..  I will continue to eat here often!  Great menu and prices as well!"}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast burritos I have had.  It fills me up through lunch.  The ham, egg, and pico de gallo make this a must have every time I stop by.  And as the other reviewer mentioned, a salsa bar to boot."}
{"text":"When it's 11:30 pm and me so hungry... I need a burrito call.  Amando's Bros. sounded like it might satisfy my hungriness but this late night burrito call left me with regret.  The carne asada burrito was COLD. I had both hands wrapped on a cold burrito. It was such a turn off. I also had the carne asada fries that were equally disappointing. It was covered in cheese and the fries tasted like it was fried in lukewarm oil. It was not crispy or crunchy, just stale and old tasting.   The next time I am feeling an itch for a burrito late at night... I will have to pass on Amando's Bros. La comida es no bueno."}
{"text":"Great basics. Beans are made right. Tortillas are typical. But the cooks know what they are doing and the sauces are above normal. Don't be scared if you don't speak English but knowing a little Spanish makes the experience better. If u live here u should speak Spanish anyways."}
{"text":"I hope writing a review after just one visit is not proven to be premature. But with that said I was very surprised how good the Carne Asada Burrito I received at Amando's was. The first thing that struck me was how hot and fresh the tortilla was. You can tell they make them fresh as they still have a hint of rough flour on the exterior. The place looks like a low budget fast food joint but on this initial visit I was quite pleased. I will stop there today for lunch and take a friend so look out for the follow-up!"}
{"text":"Got the #7 Enchilada and Burrito great food and great price. Wife got menudo said it was ok but I think menudo is disgusting anyways."}
{"text":"Automatic star awarded for having a salsa bar and a damn good one at that. Nachos were good, but the cheese wasn't melted, which, I will never complain about cheese in any form, but this was a bit different then what I am use to."}
{"text":"Sad.. they've started charging a fee for using your debit card, but that hasn't really stopped me from going- now I just take cash!"}
{"text":"This was an \"Authentic\" Mexican food place. \"Authentic\" meaning this is food made by Mexicans for Mexicans, and not by Gringos trying to make Mexican food! If you speak Spanish you'll be able to read everything on the menu and understand what the staff is saying. If not you'll get buy, but maybe you're not ready yet to try the Lengua or Menudo!  Pricing was great - a variety of daily lunch specials are offered for around $5. And they offer free corn chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Amado's Bros is a new favorite Friday breakfast joint for me and my co-workers.  The breakfast burritos are not huge, but definitely fill you up without a hitch.  Friendly smiles and good prices will keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This is an above average neighborhood Mexican restaurant in a neighborhood that needs more spicy dives. I love studying at cafes on nearby Central Ave, and this is delightfully on the way."}
