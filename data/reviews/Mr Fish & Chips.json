{"text":"The atmosphere and lack of life in the restaurant is really a downer. The owner looks upset and saddened by the empty restaurant. To top it off, we went there for lunch last week. The owner was no where to be found. We were standing in an empty restaurant. We waited for a bit then looked at the menu and left. The halibut fish was $10.99 and plus chips is another $3-4. It was not worth the price is the ambiance and furniture costs less than our meal together. We eventually walked out and went to other fish and chips restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes the decor is ghetto but I expect that from a fish and chips place. Their halibut is the best in the area, much better than Danny's which is a few blocks down. Bluenose comes close, but I still come back to here because of the location. I even prefer this place over Olde Yorke, unless I want a nice place to sit down with my girlfriend.   Again, best Halibut in Markham. Only fish and chips downtown can beat it!"}
{"text":"Mr Fish & Chips is another proof that not Fish & Chips joints are not the same.  On Saturday I were the only 3 customers there.   The deco here is dated and cafeteria like with those grayish tables.  Haddock with Chips ($8.35) tastes bland, dry and boring. Even drowning it with excess tartar sauce improves the experience at all. The batter was not crispy and the deep frying oil is definitely need to be change!  Mr. Fish & Chips is more like a self served food court set up... place your order and then wait for your order to be ready for pick up. The only saving grace is that at least my dinner is served on a real plate and with real cutlery...  I just wasted my calories on this piece of fish...   They do have lunch specials for $8.85 includes chips and pop... but I going to pass!"}
