{"text":"Ordering process wasn't easy and delivery guy got very confused finding us. Food was okay but not great. Wasn't a big fan of the General Tso's chicken. Not the worst but have had better."}
{"text":"I used to order Chinese Good once every 6 months maybe when a craving hit and would often feel like the meal missed the mark. However, since ordering last week after seeing that Chef Tong's offers Sesame Chicken, I just ordered for the 3rd time this week. I finally have a go to chinese food place!

The lemon chicken is delicious, served with a fresh lemon sauce. The sesame chicken is amazing, so is the mixed veg with almonds and my daughter devoured her chicken balls. The veggie spring rolls are crispy and filled the perfect amount.

Delivery is quick and the food arrives piping hot. The staff are incredibly friendly. Even ordering after closing when I placed an order right at their closing time the night I came back from my step-father funeral (which they didn't know, their customer service is just that good)."}
{"text":"There are not any halal Chinese restaurants in Newmarket/Aurora.  So it was nice to see this place open.  They have a big menu with the usual Chinese food suspects.  However, they have many different options, I.e. Caribbean and Hakka style Chinese food.

We ordered Hakka dishes for take out.  The food was very good.  They accommodated a substitution (beef in place of chicken) in one of our dishes.  The food was excellent.  Portion sizes were large.

I am hoping this restaurant does well.  We will be ordering our Chinese food from here from now on."}
