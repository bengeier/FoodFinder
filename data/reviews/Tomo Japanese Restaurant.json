{"text":"Oh. Ma. Gah. Some of the best sushi I've ever had! Fresh, delicious and fast, it satisfies my demanding tummy. I've been here with family a couple of times and everyone loved their meal. A relaxed atmosphere with modern decor, spacious booths and private rooms.  They make some really fun and unique specialty rolls like the Canada Roll and the Go Train Roll, served on beautifully decorated plates, and the Chicken Teriyaki has a generous helping of chicken that's perfectly tender. Great service tops it off and I'm willing to travel from downtown Toronto to eat here."}
{"text":"We tried their Sushi the other day and we loved it!!! We got one of their combos and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Tomo sushi!! I've been to many many japanese restaurants which are all average, but Tomo is definitely above average. The place isn't too big, but its definitely really nicely renovated with decor and the atmosphere of the place makes it feel expensive. The sushi is absolutely amazing!! Every roll is nicely rolled up so nothing falls apart. Everything is presented nicely. Sashimi is as fresh as it gets. Everything is amazing, except the price. Its a bit pricey for some of those specialty rolls if you compare it to other places, but Its definitely worth the price.  Service is pretty good, very attentive waiters/waitresses.  If you love sushi, then definitely hit Tomo up!  Note - miso soup is awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing service every time! I always get their chirashi bowls and only tried their deluxe chirashi bowl recently. So worth the money!! I am a very happy repeat customer :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.   The only negative is that on the weekends it is so busy that they want you to eat fast and go! so they can sit the other people....   but i guess it's a business and thats how it works.   I would still highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I loved the las vegas dragon roll. Delicious but pricey $18 for approx 7pc. Soup was delicious as well. Will be back when looking to splurge. Pricey but very good."}
{"text":"I come here quite regularly for dinner and the quality of the sushi and sashimi is always excellent!  They have several cooked dishes I enjoy too, one my favourites being the enoki beef mushroom rolls.  We also came here for an omakase dinner and it was a very nice experience.  Each of the dishes had great presentation and taste. Would definitely recommend the omakase for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10+ for a friend's birthday.  For such a large group they were very accommodating. Even though they tucked us all in a corner our server was very attentive.  We brought our own cake to the restaurant and they even helped us put a candle on it!  As for the food itself most of us ordered a party set. The quality of the sushi pieces are pretty much what you would expect for the price you pay. Will most likely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is modern and cool, but still relaxing. The waitresses are friendly, and even the chefs smile and nod at you while you you pass the sushi bar on the way to the washrooms.  They have an extensive menu here, with lots of interesting rolls. It took us a while to decide on just one to share!  You meal comes with a complimentary soup, and you have the option of either traditional miso soup, or this broth based noodle soup with tempura bits. This is easily THE BEST miso soup I've ever had. The skinny noodles are delicious in the mildly sweet miso broth, and it is the perfect portion to keep you tied over before your actual meal arrives. I would actually come here just for this!  Baked Scallop Roll ($12) -Baked scallop with mushroom  I cannot even begin to describe how good this roll was. I guess I can start by saying that I love scallops, I love mushrooms, and I love cheese. So naturally the generous combination of the three ingredients over a roll was just phenomenal. It didn't take too long before the entirety of this roll disappeared.   Dinner Combo 5 ($23)- Beef teriyaki, california roll, shrimp tempura  They have a couple bento boxes here that offer a variety and good value. This particular one was beef teriyaki. I liked that it was a decent piece of meat instead of the regular sliced beef stirfry. The rest of the box was on par with expectations.  Miso Yaki Cod ($12)- Choice of cod or hamachi  I can never resist ordering black cod when it's on the menu, and this time was no exception. I saw this Miso Yaki Cod on the menu and immediately decided to order it. No complaints here! Perfectly cooked, deliciously seasoned, and a sizable portion for its price.  Chirashi Dinner ($20) -assorted raw fish on a bowl of sushi rice  I was really impressed with this Chirashi in terms of both quality and presentation. It was the whole package: the fish was fresh, good variety, and decent portions. I thought it was also really cute that they sprinkled some sort of gold flakes on top of the red tuna. I highly doubt it was real gold, but it was a nice presentational touch nonetheless.  Spicy Roll Set ($21) -Spicy Salmon Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Dynamite Roll  A lot of other reviews online raved about the Spicy Roll Set, so I decided to see for myself how they were. I have a lower-than-average tolerance for spice, but still found that the rolls could have been spicier. Other than that, these were great. A nice consistent balance of rice and fish, and not ruined by too much tempura crunch.  Mochi Ice Cream ($2.50)  Finished off a good meal with some Mochi Ice Cream. A nice creamy vanilla bean ice cream wrapped in a chewy mochi shell.    I've actually been here more than once and really enjoyed my experience each time. They are a well-rounded in all fronts, and continually impress me with their food! In the battle of uptown sushi places, Tomo gets my vote for favourte go-to spot! :)"}
{"text":"My favourite items are their 1) Chunky Tuna Salad which comes with 3 kinds of fresh tuna diced on top of greens with spicy mayo on top; 2) Snow White Sushi Roll which has seared tai on top of shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber & masago with creamy garlic sauce.  House crunchy noodles are complimentary if you dine at the resto. Food is absolutely delicious!! They recently added an option to substitute rice with quinoa for any sushi rolls - there is a premium ($2-$3) but it's a great option for people who want more proteins instead of carbs in their diet, the 'popping' of quinoa makes the roll much more interesting as well. I would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Always leave happy and full but also with a lot less money in my wallet. haha. Worth it though."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the Tomo. Never again!!!!! We came to rest at 8:30 pm, waited 20 min for the menu. They took our order and informed us that the kitchen closes at 9:30! So we had 20 min to eat. And yes at 9:30 lights in the restaurant went down. They don't appreciate your business, don't go there"}
{"text":"I often go to Tomo with my family. My kids (pre-teens) love it.  I would say Tomo is the best sushi in Richmond Hill. First of all, the quality of ingredients is high and the food itself is outstanding. It is fresh, tasty and very authentic. Second, the decor is nice and the place is kept very clean. I love the way all staff greet each customer when you enter. I don't know if it is Japaneese, Chineese or Korean but it is so warming!  Highly recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese restaurant.  They have great variety of sushi styles as well they offer quinoa sushi. I love it!"}
{"text":"Very high quality sushi.  The sushi and sashimi just seems to melt in your mouth!  Also a good selection of traditional and unique maki.  Very accommodating of my seaweed allergy and I can always get rolls made with soy or rice paper.  Good prices for the quality."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi.  Always fresh- and the portions are very large.  One roll here is basically equivalent to two at any other restaurant!  It's always consistently good. My only complaint is it's quite expensive.  While other sushi places in the area charge $5 for a spicy tuna roll, they charge $8.  The roll is bigger, but I still find it overpriced.  Their lunch specials are very reasonably priced tho- with the same consistently excellent food!  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is really really nice. We've been here several times and the food is always good, the staff is nice and helpful, and they just recently got new interior seating. When we want good quality sushi, this is where we go."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tomo Sushi for over 5 years and in the 100 something times I have been there, ( yes, I know I'm addicted)  I have always had Amazing customer service and amazing food. And when I say amazing, I mean amazing. I travel around the world frequently, so I have been in many other sushi places not only in Toronto but all over the world and I have to say, Tomo is still my favourite. Any time I travel, I can't wait to go back home to have some Tomo Sushi. My favourite rolls at Tomo are Dynamite roll, spicy salmon, boston maki, and any of their hand rolls are just freaking AMAZING! ...mmm yum! Also their lunch specials are delish! Don't forget to get their seaweed salad as an appetizer. It's very healthy and good for you. I have been recently trying to eat healthy, so I even substitute white rice for brown rice and they are always happy to make the substitution for me.   If you like amazing service, warm delicious and fresh rolls, then you have to check out Tomo Sushi:)"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed how small my paradise roll is but my friends bento box was huge ! She definitively got her money's worth! I'm definitely coming back for those next time ! Clean, friendly and fast service !"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with crunchy house noodle soup.  The avocado and sweet potato rolls are so good.  The service is slow sometimes though"}
{"text":"What can I say... It's a 4 star sushi place but because I practically live here and the amount of times this place saves me because there aren't that many decent restaurants in Richmond Hill, this place deserves 5 stars. I've tried probably almost everything on the menu except the meat.  The sushi here is really good - 4 stars. The fish is fresh and the presentation is excellent! Not Yuzu fresh but fresh. The rolls are excellent and the Kaiso salad is great.   They also play nice classical at times.   Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Use to be a regular at Tomo, twice a week. We use to recommend this place to everyone and in the past few months have been very dissapinted. Size of the rolls shrank but prices stayed the same, taste is also not the same. Very disapointed, will never go back here again. Very sad!"}
{"text":"We went around 4:30 when the restaurant was pretty empty but service was very slow. We waited at least 20 minutes for our food to arrive and we only ordered one roll and a sashimi/sushi set. It seems that they were more focused on serving those who ordered takeout as there were many people coming in to pick up their food. The food was alright, nothing special. For those wondering, it's Korean operated. If you want to try this place, consider ordering takeout or be prepared expect a long wait."}
{"text":"For as long as I can remember I've been going to Tomo as my first choice for sushi in the Richmond Hill area. It's always amazing -- the service, the food, and the recently renovated dining room are still the best. The food is always good, and the presentation is phenomenal. I've never had a bad experience, and it's definitely worth the price. I've tried a few other places and none of them lives up to Tomo. I can't recommend anything specific on the menu because everything I've tried is fantastic. Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here countless times as it's right across the street from my boyfriend's condo. Food is always delicious and beautifully presented. Service can be a little slow at times, even when it doesn't look that busy. I love that I have the option of substituting white rice for brown rice or quinoa for an extra $1-2. I also like the added touch of serving oranges when the bill arrives.   This place is comparable to Mi-Ne sushi up the street, but I still prefer Mi-Ne for some of their rolls."}
{"text":"For anyone who truly knows Tomo, it was a great restaurant years ago. Unfortunately the same is not true anymore. The sushi is the same you will get anywhere else in Toronto or the GTA but the service is absolutely terrible. I say this having attempted to eat there about 3 times in the last 6 months. 2 of those times I managed to convince my gf to stay and eat, accepting the fact we just wouldn't receive the majority of items we ordered. The last time was the 'straw that broke the camel's back.' We sat for approx. 1 hr with only waters as the waitress served everyone else except us - making multiple trips to the table next to us who had arrived minutes after we did. Even after we asked her if we could place an order she told us we would have to wait longer. Without hesitation my gf got up and left.   We will no longer be returning to Tomo as there are a million and one sushi restaurants available that are just as good or better - with competent service to top it off."}
{"text":"I can see why this place has a high average rating. Its got quality, fresh food, a creative menu, and good service. The soup (whos name escapes me right now) they give you as a sampler was so good that i seeked it out on the menu to order a proper helping.   Its a nice clean place, but usually busy. Its further from my house than i would like otherwise i would go more often."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had.  It can be pricey but I found the vegetable combo plater a really good buy.  The place is clean and servers were nice though I've  often just got take out.  The miso soup is the best.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the quality of food was excellent! Staff are pleasant & accommodating but they get so busy especially during weekend dinnertime that service does suffer a bit.  i.e. Longer wait for food and not all the meals came at the same time...eg. 1 friend ordered maki rolls as entree and didn't get it until the rest of us were pretty much done our meals :p.  Then took 20-30 minutes to ask for more tea and the bill.  Servers kept racing by even when we tried to flag them down. Despite those set backs I would still recommend this place but just be prepared to wait and bring your patience with you especially on the weekends.  Oh, and don't forget to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Recommended. Good food. Friendly service and nice decor. Comfortable booths. Good parking.... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Diarrhea! Vomitting! Nausea! My boyfriend and I are all suffering from within less than hour after eating dinner at Tomo Japanese restaurant in Richmond Hill last night.  We experienced uncontrollable projectile vomit and diarrhea for 12 hours. We ate miso soup, green tea, sushi and sashimi dinner bento box # 4 and, chirashi dinner.  DO NOT EAT HERE.   I will be calling the health inspector and letting them know about the foods."}
{"text":"I was craving for sushi today but didn't feel like going all the way downtown or midtown, so i read some reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try.   We ordered tuna tartar for appetizer. The tuna was fresh and it was in a nice ponzu sauce.   For main course, we ordered the Small Sushi and Roll Boat. We were pretty shocked when the boat arrived. 80% of the boat was just salmon...(6 pc salmon roll, about 12 pcs of salmon sushi, 6 pc salmon + avocado roll) and then a couple pieces of tuna and butterfish sushi. Usually i expect the salmon ratio to be higher then other kinds of fish, but this was just ridiculous. Just pure salmon....definetly not worth the $42 for this boat."}
{"text":"I have never been to a sushi restaurant where the chef deluxe sushi set, which is the most expensive and significant to the brand, contains duplicate pieces of the same fish. The 15-piece so called chef's choice has only 8 varieties (7 varieties has 2 pieces, each), not to mention that the varieties are the same as your all you can eat sushi varieties. This restaurant is here just to make a profit without satisfying clients who are seeking real Japanese food, and only offer \"all you can eat\" quality at premium a-la-carte prices.    Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good. I've been here several times. Fish is fresh, service is great. I had the chirashi bowl twice and both times were great. Definitely recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chirashi lunch ($16 with rice, salad and miso soup) to go and I was pleased. The fatty salmon sashimi was very fresh and melted in my mouth. The chef had the other 2 pieces of salmon and whitefish both torched to perfection! The tuna rolled in seaweeds were also very fresh. Yes this might not be the chirashi at some Jap restaurant where you'll find scallops, squid, surf clams and eggs but the torched sashimi is a bonus! I also really like how they pack your salad with dressing in a separate container and a small tiny plate for your soya sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and great quality rolls.  I live their miso soup. So comforting.. The dynamite roll is one of my favourites.  Overall their rolls are a little bigger in size but the price is also a little higher.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten there dozens of times and everything is great and fresh. The one thing I would recommend is if you like spicy tuna ask for no tempura flakes, they're deep fried fill your stomach with nothingness."}
{"text":"Tomo is one of my favourite sushi restaurant.  Discovered this little sushi joint a few years back when it only had one unit of the plaza; recently, it expanded to two unit.  It's quite far but there's plenty of parking in the huge parking lot and if you're lucky you might find parking just outside it's door step.  You're greeted as soon as you step in.  The tables are always filled but I never find myself waiting too long for a table and the restaurant itself is never too crowded regardless of how busy the place is.  There's regular table seating, booth, and private room seating which is nice when you have a larger group.  There isn't anything I wouldn't recommend on the menu since all of the hand rolls, sushi, sashimi and noodles are super good.  I usually share a 40pcs boat or I might go for a la carte; the must is the toro sashimi ($60 for 5 pcs, it's pricy but super worth it!).  It's not the BEST sushi restaurant but it's probably the best bang for the buck when it comes to freshness of the seafood, service of waitress, and quantity you are getting (there's almost always complimentary side if you order enough).  It would be my only sushi restaurant if it wasn't so far away from me.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!  Nice decor, clean pretty washrooms and the food...great food!  Service is spot on as well!!    Black cod was amazing and the suga mamma roll was exceptional.    My only complaint, everything came out pretty much at the same time.  Would be nice to bring the appetizer first and then the rolls. It was fine tonight as I was starving but ideally I would like a slight separation between dishes.  Nice to chat while I dine.  Felt a little rushed as everything came all at once.  Can't believe I only found this place now."}
{"text":"Very good food and good service. Love the cold oranges in the end. Very refreshing. Reasonable price as well. My Favorite : The Salmon Sashimi Lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi spot, one of my top 5 in North America. The complimentary crunchy noodle soup is great, upsize it to medium for a nominal fee but don't do large, that is huuge. Everything is fresh and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Waitresses are not responding. Keep so many tables empty as reserved and ask you to wait for no reason."}
{"text":"I can strongly say that Tomo is one of the best sushi places in Toronto, however it is pricy. The sushi roll is awesome. Taste, design, portion etc., are perfect. I was there last week with my friend and one of the sushi roll wasn't properly cut out, so we called the waiter and mentioned the problem. However we almost ate the whole roll, but they changed it with a new plate of sushi roll and it made us so surprised. The staff are really really kind and welcoming.  Definitely, this is my fav sushi place and i won't get tired of Tomo sushi."}
{"text":"Lots of variety in their menu! The waiter we had was very nice, and helped us in picking some of the rolls. Overall a great place for sushi in the York Region area. Would love to come back."}
{"text":"The first thing you will notice is everyone welcoming you to this restaurant. The menu is typical Japanese with no real suprises but food is very good and the service is what you expect and nothing more. I visit here at least twice a month and recommend this place for anyone craving Japanese."}
{"text":"Not the experience I thought I would have. A little overpriced for what they offer. Chicken teriyaki really bad."}
{"text":"I'm surprised with all the raving reviews. Went here for lunch on a Sat. Was fairly busy, not too  bad. The customer service eas good, friendly and fast. We were greeted and placed at a table quickly and didn't have to wait too long for the food. The place is also really nice and clean, however my issue was with the taste of the food. Maybe we ordered the wrong items, but the taste was pretty awful and there was an awful fishy smell that I couldn't get over."}
{"text":"I have to change my rating from 4 to 1 star,  and I hate to do this.  This was our favourite sushi restaurant since we moved to Richmond Hill in 2001. Since Tomo was sold by Henry,  the original owner and chef,  the quality has slowly deteriorated.  the service has become so much worse,  and the quality of the rolls as well. They make dynamite roll with a stale precooked shrimp tempura,  and it's so dry you cant eat it.  We however have been loyal customers and have been coming over and over,  giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  Today was the last drop,  when I was placing a big order for my birthday party and they refused to make one custom spicy mushroom roll for my mom.  It used to be in the menu,  and they removed it,  but for years when we asked,  the chef would make it.  After all,  they have mushrooms and a spicy sauce and this is the only roll my mom loves.  I had to cancel my order,  and place it in Sushi Moto on Sheppard.  It will take us additional 30 mins to drive there,  but they value their customers and the food is delicious.  Henry opened this restaurant after he sold Tomo,  and the quality is amasing and very consistent.  I'm  really sad out love affair with Tomo ended like that,  after 15 years, ans i've got this rude service on my birthday."}
{"text":"Great sushi. They get creative with their sushi rolls. The service is always great. Waiters are nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Super fresh, excellent fish to rice ratio, modern ambience but slightly on the pricey side.  Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5  The spicy salmon roll was the best I've ever had to date. They were massive with 80% of each piece being salmon rather than rice. They don't skimp on the sashimi either, generous thick slices which hold true to the flavors of the flesh.  Staff was nice. She made an effort to see how we were enjoying ourselves throughout the meal.  Modern clean feel to the dinning area with clear view of the sushi bar and television promoting fresh oysters.   Although we were stuffed with just the sashimi dinner (18 pcs) and spicy roll set (20 pcs), the amount totaled made a dent in our wallet. Around $50 for just the 2 of us... Love the food but due to price, won't visit very often."}
{"text":"The smell of Japanese food is almost an aphrodisiac.  And walking into Tomo and taking a deep breath made me... ahem.  Anyway.... The food was delicious, the aromas so enticing.  The Miso was unique here, with noodles.  Everyone else, on yelp and my dining companions raved. For me it was so-so. Not quite flavorful enough.  The fish was fresh and succulent, presented artfully-- we're talking cherry blossoms depicted on my sushi plate. Painting with sauces!  Our waitress was friendly and sweet.  We were brought the wrong order, but didn't notice until we had eaten nearly half of it.  :-) They offered to take it off our bill, but we ate the rest of it, and enjoyed it so, we'll pay.  This is a delicious place, close to where we stay, and It falls into my favorite realm of food, Asian, so I guarantee we'll be back."}
{"text":"I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more... I know, cheesy, but it's true. I usually never sing love songs to restaurants, but Tomo's really special and I frequently do the 45 min trek to RH just for Tomo.  Not only is the presentation exceptional (the chefs are true artists), but it's top quality sushi and just a really beautiful experience. If you order the black dragon, they do this amazing sauce dispersion display with hot sauce, Japanese mayonnaise and teriyaki sauce. It feels like your mouth is making out with God. I don't know how else to describe it. They recently renovated and expanded and they now have these tiny sunken private rooms (that are available by reservation for 5+ people).  Also, ask about their 'frequent flyer'  or VIP cards if you plan on being a regular, like me."}
{"text":"Sushi and everything on the menu is incredible! Probably one the best in Richmond hill. Only big minus is the service."}
{"text":"Good Korean owned sushi restaurant with nice, friendly service and nice ambiance.  Fish is decently fresh, but the rice is very average.  A little on the expensive side for what you get."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent a la carte sushi, Tomo is the place to be. This Korean run sushi joint may not be authentic but they know how to create innovative and delicious sushi.   My favorite is the baked lobster roll. Six pieces of sushi is covered with a mountain of lobster sashimi and mushroom, drizzled in spicy mayo. I could keep ordering this and eat this all day!   The sashimi and sushi boats are a good deal if you have someone to share the goodies with. The sashimi selection is very standard (ie. salmon, red tuna, snapper, white tuna) - nothing that really stood out.   Everyone gets complimentary crunchy noodle soup as an appetizer, which is a nice touch.   Some minor issues: 1. The tea cup is super hot, I had to wait till my tea was almost cold to hold it. They should invest in thermal resistant cups, if that's what they're even called..  2. Service could have been better. Servers were constantly yelling at each other in Korean and rushing, making the ambience a little stressful."}
{"text":"Tomo is terrific!  I was pleasantly surprised by this little Richmond Hill restaurant.  * The sashami is fresh.  It didn't have that recently-defrosted icy crunch. We split a small sashimi boat between the two of us. It was the perfect amount of sashimi.  * They put a lot of effort into presentation.  Carved limes, tempura batter plate decoration, everything looked great!  * The servers here are incredibly courteous and attentive.  Our teacups were never empty.  The staff constantly came by to check on us.  * The tempura udon was awesome.  The broth was sweet and tasty, and the tempura bits in the soup added a lot of texture.  * The spicy seafood udon was super spicy and delicious.  They warned me as I ordered that it was spicy.  I told them that they could take it down a notch.  The reduced spice broth was still glowing red hot.  I will definitely be back.  I was having a hard time finding sushi spot I liked uptown... but, now I've found one!  :)"}
{"text":"Top fav sushi resturant. Great taste and presentation. Varieties of plates with different amzing tastes, however they are bad in customer service!"}
{"text":"Ended up stumbling into this restaurant for a quick lunch. Restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived but it took the host some time to greet and guide us to our table. Didn't feel like they were prepared for guests.   We ended up ordering from their lunch special menu. I forgot exactly the names of our dishes but mine consist of a dynamite maki roll (8 pieces) and California maki roll (6 pieces). It was actually quite filling even though it might not sound like it was a lot of food that I had. I enjoyed the dynamite roll as it was fresh but the cali roll was a bit too cold for my liking because I couldn't really taste the freshness of the ingredients. My boyfriend ordered chicken katsu over rice with egg. I didn't really like the chicken because it was dry and rice was a little bit too salty. Our lunch meals also came with a side salad and a choice of miso soup or crunch noodle soup. The side salad was delicious as I thought it was more premium than most Japanese places. They have arugula in it which most only offer lettuce and portion was generous.   Overall, the staffs were friendly and food was just ok."}
{"text":"A decent option in south Richmond Hill.  Food that we've had here ranges from bad to decent.  Service is also variable. (This is based on the 7-8 years that we've been eating here consistently).  We usually get chirashi sushi here, and the variability has to do with fish.  This Valentine's day their fish was atrocious, we wound up  taking it home and frying it, as I wasn't sure about eating it raw.  However, at other times it was very fresh.  Their spicy tuna salad is a decent sized portion, unfotunately, lately they have gotten sloppy about making it.  On several occasions I found very large lumps of tuna in it with the white connecting tissue still attached, makes you gag :(  Good bets are their special rolls and cooked food.  The spider roll is good (not too greasy, and you can still take the crab, not only the shell).  If you're in the area and want Japanese food, this is probably one of the better Japanese places in the area."}
{"text":"The intersection of Yonge Street & Sixteenth Avenue is an area of Richmond Hill sprawling with busy restaurants, small businesses, and reasonably priced housing units. It is very much the town centre, only unlike its neighbour city of Toronto, there are no saggy jeans flashing gang signs, no music blasting from modified second hand vehicles, and certainly no forty dollar haircuts with ties costing up to the weekly salaries of the yuppies who wear them. This intersection is simply a hotpot for thriving businesses trying to make an honest living, in an honest town that represents 'Canada' better than Toronto could ever hope to.  Arrash convinced me to drive from my man-child basement dwelling to his new house way deep into the suburbs to meet with our friend Chris the Korean construction guy, and Arrash's new flavour of the week whom he insist is his girlfriend. Naturally, when we talked ourselves to a hunger, the only option was to hop in my Corolla, and drive half way back the way I came to find anything that would be open at 10pm.   We found ourselves at Tomo Japanese Restaurant after Harley (the girlfriend) pointed it out to us amongst the endless neon lights blinding me from actually reading any of the signs. We entered, we sat down, and we watched the expression on Arrash's face turn from nonchalant to concerned when he realized that this wasn't an AYCE sushi restaurant after browsing the prices on the menu. Arrash is one of those guys who despite being a very nice, kind, and laid back person; had cheapness down to his very bones. It's not that he doesn't make descent money, but we all have that one friend whose finances just doesn't make any sense to the rest of the world, and he happened to be that guy among us.  Chris ordered the bento box with generic bento box rations, Arrash and I opted for the spicy roll set, each containing twenty sushi pieces, divided evenly between the salmon, tuna, and dynamite rolls. I also added an order of the shrimp tempura, which came earlier than I hoped, and had a presentation which went slightly above any other Japanese restaurant cared to put into their shrimp tempura. I can't say the same about the taste, but it was far from disappointing. Harley ordered something insignificant, which eased Arrash's tension during his obvious session of sushi math. He didn't think I would notice, but no session of math escape my attention. It took a total of twenty-five minutes for mine & Arrash's order to arrive, an amount of time which I wouldn't have taken notice of if only it were another time during the day, where my hunger could have been distracted by other things--say: better lit reflective surfaces.   The lighting was so amber it almost felt musky, as if I were in cottage Country or something. Amateur photographs of Toronto's skyline adorned the walls along with other generic art that had little to nothing in relevance to Japanese food. Booth seating, tables aligned to the walls, and elevated window platforms, the three options for patrons of this restaurant which added little to no individuality, and a team of Korean speaking service staff that are unexpectedly pleasant to engage with. The quality of the food undoubtedly trumps the shabby decor, but not to a point where it is unnoticed. The menu offers customers both an authentic (just) experience, and a satisfying array of food cooked just to the liking of less experienced palates. It is nice to see an actual selection of sake, unlike most restaurants that provide you with just one, and it's usually house.  A certain pride does go into the dishes, and is clearly visible with the presentation. To my surprise, this meant it was just enough for Arrash to quit his bickering immediately upon the arrival of our food. Kudos to the chef for turning a deeply seeded frugality to a hint of palatable sophistication.      I don't think Harley liked me much. Maybe it's my vocal conspiracies about the white men in controlling a media which they rightfully, but ultimately monopolize, or it could be my use of politically sensitive words that despite trend, I completely refuse to give up using regularly. It certainly wasn't my pathetic attempt to chat up the cute waitress, how could it be? I'm completely innocent.   What does Tomo mean? I think every answer to the question behind a Japanese restaurant's name has been met with an answer something along the lines of having to do with the name of the owner's mother. Are they Japanese so maternally fond?  It does seem to be reflected in their..umm, mature film industry, so I've heard."}
{"text":"Came here late Saturday ngiht around 9:30PM with a group of 4. We were all starving, and ended up ordering about 4-5 different rolls, a sushi dinner, and vegetable tempura to share.  The sushi was very fresh and the service was great. I love how each table is partitioned off you get a lot more room and privacy.   The tempura was average, and quite pricey for the serving size. We only got about 6-7 pieces  of vegetable.   I love how they give you the crunchy house noodles as a complimentary starter. The tempura flakes on top really gave it that nice texture."}
{"text":"I have been to Tomo about 4-5 times now and I keep telling myself to just \"give it another chance\". I'm not going to lie, the food is decent but it is ridiculously overpriced. I ordered the Philadelphia roll, it was 11 dollars I believe, and it was the size of something you would get at an AYCE place.  Unless you're willing to spend at least $50, I recommend heading up to Mi Ne. Larger portions, less expensive, and just as good."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 7 and saw that they had a semi-private room available and perfect for our party size, but they declined sitting us there because it was closed (?).  The restaurant is fairly big with ample seating.  There were many servers around but since we were in a corner we didn't always get noticed right away.    The rolls and combos on the menu are on average a few dollars more expensive than usual, so I expected higher quality.  Unfortunately, while it's certainly not bad, quality is just average.  Would not come again as it's more expensive than normal."}

This is really wonderful Sushi as if we are dining in Japan. Quality of rice and Sashimis are excellent. We are visitors from Japan and impressed and enjoyed so much.  I can recommend this restaurant strongly."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by Tomo.  Originally came to this plaza for Pho but the restaurant was closed so we decided to try Tomo and am glad we did.  Fair prices for lunch menue and enjoyed the quality of food.  Chirashi: consisted of 6 salmon, 3 salmon belly, 3 toro, 3 butterfish seared, 3 soft pink fish (not sure of the variety but was smooth texture, very good), and a generous portion of rice.  Set includes soup and salad as well, but no dessert.    Kalbi Tempura Bento: Good portion of grilled kalbi with some chopped veggies, 3 pc california roll, tempura shrimp x2, tempura veggies cosisted of mushroom, yam, and squash. Set includes soup and salad as well, but no dessert.  Service was good and restaurant is spacious and nice inside with lots of booth seating and private rooms for groups.  Overall a good dining experience and would come back.  Only reason the rating is not 5* is due to no dessert, as most jap restaurants at this price range would include ice-cream or fruits."}
{"text":"i enjoyed coming here - lucky for me it's closer to where I work now, so it's not as out of my way.  I came back after a long time, but it was as great as I remembered it.  This time I decided to try something different (something mamma) role. it was warm, fresh and delicious. their authentic roles are definitely worth the trek out there for!   the service was great, water and tea refilled, I asked for extra soup, it was only $1 more which I think is a decent price for delicious soup!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place, not only in Toronto, but really my top 3 in life (and I eat a LOT of sushi). While a bit more expensive than your typical sushi place, this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. The fish is fresh, the presentation amazing, and Ken (one of the sushi chefs, or should I say, the best sushi chef :) and his team are friendly and helpful. Occasionally, there's a bit of a wait for a table (especially on weekend nights, but to be expected!), and there's not a huge staff, but they are generally attentive with a few real superstars who go above and beyond.  Must trys: crunchy noodle soup!! It's free (yes, free!) with your meal (generally). My other favs are Green Dragon Roll (a classic), anything sashimi, and the roll made with bbq short ribs that I never remember the name of (but always get). It'll be a favourite!"}
{"text":"Sometimes we tend to forget quality places in our own backyard. You know the kind, the ones you've been to in past, loved, taken for granted and then driven past dozens of times when all your little heart desires is what this place offers.  Tomo is that sorta place. Located in the restaurant rich plaza at Yonge & Weldrick in Richond Hill (where you can also find Laser Quest and Putting Edge) it might not be AYCE sushi, but it's quality sushi, which is many times much, much better.  I met an old social media pal for an impromptu lunch/dinner as he was in the neighbourhood. He'd read good recommendations on Yelp about their crunchy noodle soup, and well, I just knew from experience this place was plain good.   I ordered the sashimi dinner and the Kalbi beef roll. The Sashimi platter was very fresh, made of thick cuts of fish served at the perfect temperature. You know the one that allows the fish to slowly melt across your tongue. Yep. That type. It came with a miso soup (which was a different interpretation being served with noodles - a first for me) and a very full salad. Standard fare I know, but very tasty.  The Kalbi roll was something new for me and I literally just did a game of eeny-meeny-miny-mo to choose something I'd never had before. I should do this more often as the dish roll was wonderful with a mix of kalbi beef short ribs and shrimp. What made the dish for me was the extra serving of kalbi on the side. Yumm!  Richmond Hill has been blessed with quite a few reliable sushi spots amidst the sea of dim-sum and shawarma shops, but this one should not be overlooked. The service, decor and price are merely welcome additions to an already stellar menu, which I plan to return for time and time again in 2014  Arigatou gozaimasu Tomo! Arigatou gozaimasu!  EC Out!"}
{"text":"i am one of their regular customers, my first experience is August 2012. their specil dragon rolls are really recommended."}
{"text":"I was regular Tomo Sushi customer for few years. We are lacking good quality restaurants in Richmond Hill and Tomo was a bright spot. However something changed with recent renovations and the quality of food dropped significantly. I hope it is just a temporary fluk. But if Tomo wants my business - they need to go back to the roots and concentrate on quality of food instead of investing in red decour (and IMHO red decour is tasteless as well)."}
{"text":"We came here for mother's day dinner and as expected, it was packed due to the occasion.  Staff were very polite and attentive. We were seated in a private divided area, which was nice. We ended up ordering the sushi, roll and sashimi combination of 43 pieces along with seafood yakisoba. The sashimi quality was very good! Texture was moist and juicy and smooth. Yakisoba was also delicious, as they had plenty of mussels/squid/shrimp and veggies along with the noodles.  Overall, a pleasant experience. Would come again."}
{"text":"\"Best sushi in Richmond Hill, maybe Markham.\" -Me  I used to frequent Tomo back in the day as it was a solid sushi venue extremely close to my home. Recently they went under massive renovations and this ordinary looking sushi restaurant was converted into a chic, elegant, and classy venue with outstanding Jap grub.   I highly recommend gathering 5+ sushi aficionados and calling ahead to reserve a booth. Sitting in a booth at Tomo is not mandatory, but the shoeless accommodation definitely enhances the experience.  I am a self-proclaimed sashimi monster, and the cuts and freshness of Tomo's sashimz is eloquently gangster. They are consistently thick, cool, beautifully shaped and probably the best tasting sashimi I have ever had in the GTA. At many places after eating a lot of sashimi I encounter a weird chalky taste in my mouth, but not at Tomo. I could eat there all day and night and still order dessert as they're closing.   If you attend with a large group, they have pre-set combos that include sashimi, maki rolls and sushi. I was skeptical to order these pre-set combos as I always am at restaurants, but at Tomo the chef really puts a phenomenal spread together and it is definitely worth it to venture the pre-set route.   The menu itself is extensive, and Tomo boasts many delicacies that you would not find at most Sushi restaurants. From the miso to sake bombs, truly a great experience from beginning to end.  Little things such as the citrus infused asian orange salad dressing and overall presentation of boats are simply stunning and captivating.  I would also recommend the spicy Korean bulgogi, it is deep with flavour and riddled with caramelized onions and gochujang (fermented pepper paste).   Do it, you will not be disappointed. 5/5.  Ideal Order (5-6ppl)  Green Dragon Roll (8) Hamachi Negi Maki (6) Preset Sashimi, Sushi and Maki combo (s, m, l) Spicy Bulgogi Dinner Salmon Teriyaki Sapporo  Hakutsuru Sake (only chilled)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Tomo for a quick lunch and we ordered soup and 2 rolls only. Everything was fresh and good quality but not something special. I would expect better tasting food as the price was 20-30% higher than in other sushi places nearby. Was pleasantly surprised with the service, one star added due to the service, it is rare to find quick and friendly service in sushi restaurants these days."}
{"text":"Just to confirm, Tomo is managed by Koreans.  Nothing wrong with that...  but for the price of the sushi, the grade of it is at best average.    Service was horrible as well.  Hostess and servers were cold toward my girlfriend and I.  It was also very difficult to wave down the servers.    There are much better options at this price point.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Quick service but very pricey for what's offered. Quality is average for a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:15pm on a Friday night and had to wait 20min for a table for three, the place is small and there's not many tables due to the partitions that seclude each table. We were fortunate that some other tables before us gave up on waiting as that helped shorten the wait time, and you can easily pass the time by thinking about what to order as the dine in and take out menu are the same.  Each table is partitioned off so you don't look face to face with any other tables, and even keeps the noise down. The seclusion creates a more intimate ambiance and let's you focus on your food and your company as opposed to checking out what others ordered. However this makes it a bit tougher for waiters to see you, so actively raise your hand if you need something.   We ordered a sushi and sashimi combo (~40pcs), 2 miso soups, and a seaweed salad to share among three girls. It was the perfect amount of food as the sushi had reasonable amounts of rice, the sashimi was reasonably sized, and the seaweed salad was a good portion for the price. All in all I had no complaints about the food. The fish was fresh and the rice was well flavoured and stuck together with the fish for the sushi. Plating was simple but still attractive - great for photos!  All in all, from an à la carte sushi perspective I had no complaints, the price to quality was reasonable and quality was on the good side. I did notice that tempura orders are a little skimpy for the price, and the variety of dons, bentos, and noodles is limited. There's a large variety of specialty rolls, though majority of them are generic fillings that cater to a wider audience (raw fish eaters and non-raw fish eaters). I would've liked to see more specialty items and variety in their combo deals."}
{"text":"Even though the meal left me thirsting for water (not because of a spice factor but more of a salt factor), I feel confident in giving this place the 4-stars. their sushi pizza has a vegetarian option (if you ask for it without the masago). it's got shiitake mushrooms chopped up into tiny pieces and mayonnaise. not as hearty as the one at sushi queen but it was nice & crispy. there were two orders of shrimp tempura udon at my table. they brought the tempura to the table but it was a long time after that they brought the udon soup. i managed to steal a couple of pieces of tempura. i loved the potato web-like tempura. their tempura had a decent flavour to it and it remained crispy even after the long wait. i tried the spicy enoki mushroom roll which has tempura bits in it. very delicious! yum yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!  Original owner of this place has a place called Moto in north york now which is also excellent.  Tomo has some of the best sushi i have ever had and its presented beautifully and with great service! Pairs nicely with some sake or asahi beer!   Crunchy noodle soup is redonkulous!"}
{"text":"This place is always great if you want someplace nice and with great service. The food is amazing, no matter what you order. The sushi tastes very fresh and is made to order. Will definetly come again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night and had an okay experience. The employees were really nice but there was hardly any food I could eat. Being someone who is lactose and gluten intolerant, I was slightly disappointed with their ability to accommodate me.   I ended up ordering an avocado roll and edamame. The employees forgot to bring me my edamame, which they brought as soon as I reminded them (earning them a star in my eyes) but they had no teppanyaki style meats that I could eat. I asked them if I could eat the beef wrapped around the mushrooms and they said it is deep fried with breadcrumbs. I asked if they could grill it instead and they said no (this is actually one of my favourite items at other sushi restaurants so I was a bit disappointed).   My friend ordered a set dinner, which came with a soup and salad. He encouraged me to try his sashimi, and it wasn't that fresh. It was actually pretty disgusting and that's the reason I didn't want sashimi on this evening.   All over, I would not return to this restaurant. The food is mediocre and did not meet my expectations.   With that being said, the employees were extremely friendly and kind. They continuously refilled our tea glasses and did a good job."}
{"text":"This is a quality sushi place; one the best I've been to in Richmond Hill, and at the top of my list for sure. I haven't been in a while, but every time I've gone I've had a great experience, whether it be for take out or dine-in. There is lots of seating, and overall the place is very cozy with their booth arrangement. They give complimentary crunchy noodle soup when you dine in (taste size), yum!  The last time I went I was on my way downtown when I told my friend I was hungry. We came here, and sat in a booth. The table next to us had a couple sitting, and the girl had the same dress on that I did. I insisted to my friend that we move, and kindly asked the server that we be moved and explained the situation. It was funny, and the servers made light of the whole thing, cracking jokes throughout the evening, telling me I wore it better, etc., lol.   My friend ordered salmon sashimi, and I ordered a dragon roll (my usual go to). The fish always tastes very fresh. I have always had a consistently good experience."}
{"text":"We ordered a medium size boat. The food was alright, a bit better than AYCE. But the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"A great find! Lots of dishes to choose from. This is my new favorite neighborhood japanese restaurant!"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto. A little expensive and extremely busy around lunch and dinner (reservations are highly recommended).   The tempura, edamame, volcano and red dragon rolls are all classic orders. Sashimi is extremely fresh. I always end off my meal with mango ice cream, regardless of how full I am."}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated location that is clean and quiet, just as you would expect from a more expensive sushi place in Richmond Hill! I've tried the harumaki (spring roll), the vegetable sushi platter, and the crunchy spicy tuna roll. I was pleased with the service but didn't find the quality of the sushi to be outstanding compared to other nearby locations, such as Kiyo sushi down on Elgin Mills. It was not that the sushi was poor by any means - but I wouldn't be tempted to say it stood out relative to what else is available in the area for the price."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with a group of 8 people. We were placed in a booth beside the window, when we asked her if we could switch tables since it was freezing she said it wasn't possible, and that the back room was for dinner only which was a bummer.   Our server seemed...overwhelmed. When we asked for water for the table, she brought back one glass. One glass. When we asked for more green tea since the 8 of us went through a pot very quickly it took a very long time. Asked her if it was possible to get two pots, she seemed extremely confused about that request.   The service was also extremely slow. She never came over to check on us and we waited quite awhile for our bills.   The food however is really good and the amount of fish in the rolls was amazing. A salmon roll had 2-3 pieces of salmon in each.  Food is a la carte so you do end up paying quite a bit if you're very hungry. It seems to be the same as most sushi places though, nothing outstanding about it as a few other reviewers have pointed out."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in town. I have been to at least 15+ sushi restaurants and none compare to this one. Great service, always a clean restaurant, vigilant staff and great tasting food! My favourite is the red dragon roll, very delicious. The mix of ingredients is great and there is no fish smell/ taste as in some other restaurants. If you're in the area- worth a try! Pricing is a bit on the more expensive $15 for a red dragon roll. 9$ for a dynamite roll. But the portions are big so it covers it. I would give it a solid 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I often order Tomo sushi for take out.  I am consistently impressed by their service and quality of sushi/fish.  My typical order (for 2), with leftovers consists of:  - Chicken Teriyaki Roll.. I particularly love this roll because the roll is large in size and they slice chicken pieces right on top of the roll, with drizzled teriyaki sauce, which gives it that added yumminess  - Salmon Avocado Roll  - Kamikaze Roll  - Green Dragon Roll  - Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll  - Miso Soup/ Garden Salad  All rolls are fresh and made to order, with very quick pick-up time.  I would love to try their Las Vegas roll, as I've heard it is to die for.  Be prepared to pay a pretty penny at Tomo, as their sushi is not cheap... However, I find it to be one of the better spots in York Region."}
{"text":"As you approach Tomo Sushi, you see a clean, decorated interior through the windows. And then you go in, and you see the kind of decor that's familiar in a lot of japanese restaurants in the area. There are lots of tables, and a few booths for larger parties.  The washrooms are very clean and well decorated. Comes with a bottle of Listerine, and it's one of the more premium varieties. It's great when a business takes care of their washrooms.  The menu is quite large: soup, salads, noodle soup, a la carte sushi or sashimi, maki rolls, donburi, bento, and so on. They even have a \"kids meal\", which I found quite amusing. They have quite a large rolls menu, split into three categories: \"classic rolls\", \"contemporary rolls\", and \"new rolls\". Not much of a rolls fan myself, so I suppose the \"new rolls\" are stuff that's somewhat unique to Tomo? Or maybe just newer in terms of when they were formulated.  The menu also comes with combos for larger groups, which features preset selections of a rolls and/or sashimi. If you're not sure what to pick, these might be alright, but they tend to throw in \"classic rolls\" like california rolls or dynamite rolls, which may or may not be particularly interesting or worth it. Personally I would recommend just picking some rolls off their \"new rolls\" menu cause it comes with some pretty interesting creations. Despite saying that, we ended up picking the New Tomo Combo, which is a 38-piece platter consisting of Califonia, Dynamite, Sugar mama, Russian roulette, and Crunch spicy salmon roll.  After ordering, they start by giving you a free sample of their house crunch noodle soup. It is quite a nice bowl of noodle soup. Much better than the common salad + miso soup that other places serve. The noodle soup itself costs only $7 if you suddenly decide to have a larger serving after trying the sample. Hot tea is available free of charge, so definitely take advantage of that.  Our rolls platter ended up coming after 20 minutes, and the waitress brought over a bowl of seaweed salad to apologize for the long wait. Perhaps I had been a bit loud with my joking about \"compensation\" for the long delay, but either way the service is there. Throughout the meal, waitresses come over to refill tea and water and to check up on your meal.  The rolls are large, definitely bigger than that stuff you get from Loblaws. They also come with lots of filling and not too much rice; you can actually see the seaweed through the coat of rice.  The Sugar Mama comes with a large piece of torched white tuna on top. Delicious. I do like torched fish. The Russian Roulette is a spicy salmon surrounded with banana peppers and jalapeno. Doesn't really live up to its name when every piece comes with a kick, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The other stuff were just fillers to me. Honestly, just pick from the \"New Rolls\" menu if you're here for rolls, cause the standard fare is just...too standard. Spend that extra $2-3 for the premium stuff.  It's a nice place if you're looking for a simple, japanese not-AYCE place."}
{"text":"3.5 Rating  The only thing holding this place back from a comfortable 4 stars is that I feel the price point doesn't quite match the food. I've been to other places with comparable food and spent noticeably less.  There's still lots of positives to say about this place, and the fish was great quality and the presentation of the dishes was done very well."}
{"text":"tomo is a huge disappointment...the food was mediocre and the service leaves a lot to be desire. i waited a long time to be serve and the teriyaki was bland and dry. if anyone ignore my review and insist on going to tomo, do not try any of the grill items.  i suffered backlash from looking for a server to get my check. that was the extent of how bad the service was. not only i will never go back to tomo again, i will head to my favorite sushi place in SOHO new york to erase tomo from my conciousness!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't frequent this area often but came here with friends because of their recommendation. I ordered the Lunch Sushi Combo A and was served with a surprisingly large bowl of complimentary salad for starters. The vegetables were fresh, colorful to the eye, and along with the dressing, pleasant to taste. We then got to choose between the option of the standard miso soup or a noodle soup. Never having heard of it before, I picked the noodle soup and quite liked it - it tasted similar to chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken) but had a unique Japanese twist to it. The noodles were thinly stranded and soft and the soup wasn't overwhelming with MSG.   The sushi itself was neatly presented on a large plate and was reasonably proportioned. The fish was good and the sushi held together nicely.   A complimentary orange was also served after the meal. The flesh of the orange was pre-cut into cubes but orderly placed back into the skin for presentation. It looked quite nice and I overall appreciated that they made such efforts throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Consistently good sushi and bento boxes. This place is Korean owned and they serve Korean dishes like kalbi and bulgogi as well. Crunchy noodle soup is a nice free appetizer, and if you have kids, they will love it!"}
{"text":"BEST sushi quality AND service in ALL of richmond hill, markham and gta area. Portions are huge and prices are decent but not \"cheap\". They start you off with a complementary soup and end with a complementary orange."}
{"text":"Came with my cousin since we were craving sushi... I think we got the dynamite roll ....ok if it's a roll isn't the rice suppose to be on the outside not seaweed...minus point for that because I don't like my sushi that way && I've had much better this tasted soggy???   The soup they give you was really good though (I would actually give that 5 stars)   The service is very good here they are so friendly so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"The pricing at this restaurant is around 50-100% more than your average sushi restaurant. Unfortunately the quality of this restaurant is barely average, with poorly seasoned rice and the use of non-fresh fish. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered the small combination and white dragon roll for 3 people. The sashimi was fresh, however the rice was a bit inconsistent (little bit hard, too much rice vinegar). White dragon roll was yummy. Prices are little bit higher than other sushi restaurants but it was just enough to fill 3 people.  Prompt and good service. Spacious and clean restaurant. Overall, it's a good place to eat sushi in Rhill."}
{"text":"I love japanese food and eat it religiously.  Its not an AYCE but i felt the price was very close to it.  pricey compared to a lot of other places i have been to that are similar in quality and service.  Food is a 4/5 and service was pretty good i would say 4.5/5.  Venue is really nice.... They didnt cheap out on decor and renos.   Again.. Its pricey... Not exactly the place to go to if you want a deal."}
{"text":"I've visited Tomo's at least a dozen of times and every time I notice two exact same things: the quality of the food and the price. The food was consistently good and the price was fair, considering that me and my girlfriend always left the place satisfied."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi.  This place looked promising with all the good reviews, however I left disappointed. We ordered the salmon lovers combo and the snow valley roll. It started off well, the complimentary soup was a nice change from the standard miso. The Sushi however is subpar. Granted, we got A LOT salmon, but the rice was undercooked and you can tell the salmon was frozen as it was so cold. The snow valley roll was supposed to have unagi (eel) in it but to be honest, if there was any it was only skin. More avocado than anything, and for the price, it's definitely not worth it. Disappointing."}
{"text":"My friend who likes Japanese food but is not a fan of AYCE recommended this place. I got the chicken teriyaki special box (picture below). Great taste. Fresh. Wonderful service. Nice decor. Price is reasonable. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'll place this sushi restaurant above the average maybe at a 3.5.  It took a while for the food to come given not many patrons at the time, but I did get a complimentary soup, which apparently everyone gets.  It was a welcome change from the normal miso offered.  This noodle soup was tasty, with different textures, some soft, some crunchy.    I got the angry tuna, check the pic, yes that's actual hot peppers. Add that to the wasabi and your in for a tasty bite that will leave you sweating!  Then came the miso cod, wow!  Flaky, light, delicious!  I highly recommend this dish.  And the restaurant for that matter."}
{"text":"Really good a la carte sushi. The rolls were fabulous (lots of filling not too much rice) and the sashimi nice and fresh. Don't come with large groups as service might be hit or miss.  As with all a la carte places, the food is expensive and this place is no different. Obviously you're getting better quality food but if you're all about value then possibly think twice. However, I'd recommend you to try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"First time visit to this Sushi restaurant for a birthday party.  In my view you can bucket restaurants into 2 types: Traditional vs North American style.  I define North American style sushi as those rolls that have cream cheese or other non-traditional Japaneses ingredients.  Tomo's menu is mostly traditional.  We ordered a sushi boat to get a sampling of maki and sashimi and sushi.  Firsh was nice and fresh... like the albacore... We particularly liked the Soft shell crab roll.  Tomo isn't a budget restaurant but also not on the expensive side.  Overall I would say represents decent value.  If you enjoy the variety of North American style sushi you may feel a little restricted.  I prefer more traditional style sushi.  We really enjoyed our dinner there and will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"These guys are slipping, fish has been lower quality, watery like it had just been defrosted last 2 times I picked up. Consistency is the key to success. MI-NE is winning this sushi war currently and it's not even close."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie combo sushi and tofu teriyaki. All the options were great! Especially enjoyed the sweet potato tempura and avocado sushi. Definitely recommend for some good vegetarian sushi options!"}
{"text":"In a sea of mediocre AYCE sushi joints in the GTA Tomo seems to be a bit of a rarity; an a la carte sushi restaurant that clearly put an emphasis on presentation and freshness.   I recently came here on a Sunday night and was thoroughly impressed. I tried 5 dishes: Edamame ($6), Beef sashimi appetizer ($11), 5pc Salmon sashimi ($10), 5pc white tuna sashimi ($10), and a spider roll ($10). My favourite dish was the beef sashimi; the beef was so tender, served with a light ponzu sauce that did not overwhelm the natural taste of the meat and green onion for some sharp flavour, the beef slices practically melted in my mouth. The salmon and tuna sashimi were cut into thick pieces and were clearly very fresh, they were absolutely delicious.   The spider roll was the biggest disappointment of the night, the soft-shell crab had a thick batter on it which was a little too heavy and overpowered the crab. This roll tasted like a roll you can get at most sushi restaurants however it was ridiculously big (more than twice the size of the tiny rolls one gets at AYCE joints). The size of the roll definitely justified the hefty price tag, the execution did not. The edamame was standard; you can't really screw up boiled soy beans. Our meal also came with a complimentary miso soup which was delicious, and surprisingly had some noodles in it which was a nice touch. The presentation of all our dishes was very nicely done.   The restaurant is very sharp and modern looking; it was absolutely slammed on a Sunday night. The wait staff was attentive and checked up on us regularly. The bathrooms were absolutely immaculate, and even had mouthwash if you wanted to freshen up after your meal. I will definitely return to Tomo; however when I come back it will likely be for one of their lunch specials as the dinner menu is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! I have introduced so many people to this restaurant, and each friend loved it.  The chef recognizes me each time I get my pick up- and everyone is always so pleasant and warm.  The food is incredible. I order salmon sashimi, dynamite roll, gyoza, teriyaki etc- ALL delicious.  My favourite sushi place in Richmond hill hands down!"}
{"text":"The place is very nice. The food is high quality and the selection is awesome. I particularly love that they serve fresh oysters! and always have a 2 for 1 deal. Another nice touch is the choice if crispy miso soup which is delicious. The price is a bit on the high side, but as they say you get what you pay for and Tomo Sushi definitely delivers in that department. The only thing that's hit and miss is the speediness of the service, I've had times where we had to wait 30+ min for our food and other people seemed to be getting their food faster even though we ordered before them. On the flip side, they always bring out complimentary dishes while we wait and that's a nice touch. At the end of the day this is a great place and I will happily come back."}
{"text":"After my husband and his brother had gone out for guys night to this place, my husband spoke to the staff and had asked if they were able to accommodate gluten free options for his wife (me) they sounded really confident and led my husband to believe they were well aware and capable to accommodate.   This evening we were in the area after work and decided to grab a bite. As soon as we arrived we were seated, the place seemed fairly nice and decor was updated, it took a little while for our server to arrive.  Once arrived we were asked to place our drinks, right after I requested she help me review the menu and see what my gluten free options were since they seemed ok to accommodate and they offered gluten free soya sauce, which to me would be a clear sign welcoming those with sensitivity and allergies.  The server asked me questions like if I was ok to have mayo and spicy sauce  which was certainly strange...  so I had to go over a whole bunch of things that may have gluten in them (which I would expect her to know!!)  I was basically left with minimal options, since there was flakes, sauce, crab meat (which is artificial and contains wheat) in most of the rolls.... I was discouraged to to see warning signs... these are obvious things that servers should be well made aware off, I also notified her that they must try and keep my food separate, use a clean surface and clean knife for my 2 rolls... Exactly like for people with peanut allergy, don't use a knife with peanut sauce in it... I also requested, that the roll with the tempura shrimp, be replaced with a regular shrimp as I am allergic to the wheat/ gluten and it is deep fried with other breaded items.... They decided to charge me extra for that! Out of the 2 rolls, 1 was completely wrong....and the waits were a bit long for simple orders.... And those are the reasons why I struggled to give a decent rating.  But what did earn this place it's stars is that the food was good, fresh, and the decor was fair. They also discussed with me that they plan to have a meeting about gluten free options and perhaps create a a menu or so... well that is after I suggested it... at least they agreed and will bring it up and hopefully give it some real consideration, since it's very rare!  And us few who do suffer with allergies should have the freedom and choice to out and enjoy our meals with family and friends in a regular With no anxieties of any accidental cross contamination, getting sick or worse."}
{"text":"I came into Tomo Sushi for dinner after leaving disgruntled from Akane sushi where I will never return (see separate review). Once again I didn't want to be seated near the from door but the only single tables available were facing the from door, so I was offered a seat at the Sushi bar. After a few minutes there I realized it was quite uncomfortable so I was fortunately offered a booth by a different waiter. The sushi was tasty and fresh (I ordered an assorted selection), and though not the best certainly offered good value. Lastly I ordered a side order of Uni, and it was quite tasty :)."}
{"text":"Heartbreaking giving this place two stars but you can only hold onto what Tomo used to be for so long. We would go there at least twice a week and after 6 years I find myself wanting to return less and less and now only go in a last case scenario. The sizes of sushi and quality of sushi have decreased significantly. It used to be one of the best in my opinion but it seems with all the popularity they've gotten they abandoned their roots and what made this such a great place before. The had some great people that worked there but slowly there are many new faces. They've changed the menu around and don't allow you to make changes to suit your preferences, even when it is in their means, they offer no help or suggestions to resolve problems instead just wait there until you choose something else which is frustrating considering being a \"regular customer\" for many years. They've added additional costs to changing rolls in sushi combos (incase you wanted to substitute a roll that came in a combo for another one) and that's on top of Paying more incase the substitution was more, which I'm complete fine with. But when a restaurant changes their menu, quality of food has gone down hill, they could care less about convenienceing the customer, offer no assistance and increase their prices, and hear the same things from other people in the area it makes me personally less inclined to come back or bring people like I have for so long. Like I said before it really is heart breaking but from what I've seen I think I might just follow some of the other reviews on here and try some other places in the area."}
{"text":"We came on Friday night, didn't have to wait long to be seated. However, the service was inattentive, perhaps they were understaffed, it took many attempts to get the staffs' attention to make the order. We couldn't even get any tea until the server came to give us the bill half an hour before the restaurant closes (which we haven't even asked for it yet). Instead of cleaning the table AFTER we leave, we had to pass her the dishes because she couldn't reach of course. I was gonna order some dessert but forget it. The two stars are for the quality of food. I ordered the sushi deluxe - Food was fresh but I don't think I will ever come back for this kind of service."}
{"text":"Traditional Japanese, beef was a little tough, salmon needed more taste, lacking variety on the platter....they got 4 because I couldn't give them 3.5"}
{"text":"I lied. They put both the salmon kama and hamachi kama back on the menu, but upped the prices. They're now $9 and $13 respectively.   We came for lunch today as a party of 5. We ordered the tempura lunch ($10), the kalbi lunch ($14), two orders of the hamachi kama ($13 each), and two orders of the aburi hakko ($10 each).   For more information on the tempura lunch, please see my previous review. The kalbi lunch was the same as the tempura lunch, except with short ribs instead of tempura. The short ribs had grill marks on them, and were quite tender. Good stuff. I prefer the tempura though.  The hamachi kama is now an even larger portion than before (or it seems that way to me), but it no longer comes on a sizzling plate and it no longer comes with pan fried veggies. However, it's still quite good in terms of price to portion, quality, and taste ratio. Tomo is still my favorite place to get hamachi kama. Grandma loved it.   Aburi hakko is new to their menu, if I recall correctly. It's 6 pieces of blowtorched box sushi with assorted fish and garnishes. This isn't rectangular pieces of sushi. This is more square.The rice could have been a tad more pressed together, as it fell apart quite easily, but the rice was quite tasty. The fish definitely had that torched smokey flavor. The fish was also very tender, and decently generous in portion. The garnishes were nice too. The few pieces I had/saw had a thin slice of marinated shiitake mushroom under the fish. There were also fish eggs, chopped green onions, and some slivers of something I could not identify. It was quite pretty. Considering the upcharge most places put on blowtorched sushi, this is quite fair in terms of price to quantity.   Service was quite pleasant, but not outstanding.  Fun story of the day. We were sitting a few tables down from a table where there was a boy under 2 years old. He kept pointing at us and smiling, so we pointed back at him every time he pointed at us. Every time we pointed back, his smile got bigger. It was adorable. His parents caught on eventually and smiled back at us. They left before we did, but his mom made sure to tell him to say bye to us and to blow us a kiss. D'awww."}
{"text":"I can her with high hopes and when taking a piece of my sushi pizza there was plastic in the rice. They gave no compensating and couldn't even care about the plastic. Their customer service is awful and will never come back here again. Awful restaurant"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Tomo for the last two years.   Pros: -The sushi is delicious -Reasonably priced  Cons: -Dinner is always busy -Service is not the best  Probably the best sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 6 and the food was good!   The Lunch Bento boxes included a variety of choices for under $20 each that included an appetizer noodle soup (SO yummy),  and impressive portions of meat, tempura, sushi rolls, salad and rice.   The kalbi/bulgogi box were both very tasty, but we were less impressed with the kids beef terriyaki that didn't taste quite right and the meat was too tough for the kids.   The tempura udon was a big portion compared to most places  (I couldn't finish it all!)   We shared the Sugar Mama roll (white tuna seared with tempura and scallops (?) and it was super good!   No free desserts but the prices, quality and portions more than made up for it. Restaurant was very clean and modern. Service was friendly but a bit slow. They could have used a couple extra servers.   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The sushi boat was good but a touch on the small side.   It was fresh and very nicely presented.  The big big disappointment for us this time was our Seafood Udon for $15.   It came in a relatively small bowl but where is the seafood?   We had to fish (no pun intended) to find to find a small mussel, squid, tiny (1 cm) scallop.  That's it!  No kidding.   Absolute rip off!   I would be ashamed to serve this \"Seafood\" Udon for $15!  Service like usual is very good.   I previously gave them 4/5 but this Udon certainly left a very very bad taste in my mouth despite the great sushi boat.  In fact I was about to give them 2/5 but the boat and service brought it up to 3/5.    A great example how the ratings can be brought down by one single item."}
{"text":"Came here a few times, every time I come, service was always great. The staff are always friendly and pleasent plus the environment is quiet and peaceful.   Came for lunch and dinner; Fish are fresh and the rolls are made well.  There are some unique rolls."}
{"text":"Service was fabulous. We seemed to have multiple servers! ... however non intrusive. The sashimi boat was excellent and a good deal. Place was very busy on a Sunday night so must've been good because very popular."}
{"text":"Came at 10:20 to sit, ready with the order has been told to get up and take take out even tho they close at 11 . Can't stand when restaurants do this things ."}
{"text":"Quality has gone downhill here since they changed owner a year ago. I used to like sushi lunch A which used to include fatty tuna pieces and much bigger pieces of sushi. They also used to provide an orange after your meal. No more. No fatty tuna, no orange after meal. The sushi pieces are getting smaller and smaller by the day. I live around here so I come here often. Furthermore, there are two female waitresses that are quite rude. I heard their unpleasant exchanges with other patrons and they give everyone a condescending look. Time to find another usual sushi spot. Sucks that most restaurants go downhill like this. Completely destroying the brand's legacy."}
{"text":"Restaurant says that they close at 10:30pm, I called 10:27pm to order for takeout and the lady said they already did the last call, which probably looks like they did the last call at 10:00pm so the staff can be out by 10:30pm because they can't wait to go home!!!  They should change their hours till 10:00pm NOT 10:30PM!! Their hours are inaccurate."}
{"text":"Quick short review, the ambiance and service was better than the food. I got a platter of assorted rolls to share, and while the rolls had great rice to substance ratio, I thought $36 was a bit expensive for the quantity. The food was definitely fresh and served very quickly, but I nothing amazing that makes me want to return."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty fresh, rolls are good. We had the assortment medium sushi platter, we found the salmon vs other fish was disproportional for sushi, shasimi and maki if you like salmon then that's great. Overall can give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and enjoyed myself.  The interior was very clean and modern.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We came 40 minutes before closing because the Korean restaurant next door didn't want to serve us so close to closing.  The staff at Tomo has no problem with us staying in to eat at that time.  Food was nicely presented and yummy. The salad was alot nicer than most sushi restaurants I've been to.  The price is on the pricier side but is average for a sushi restaurant.  Dinner bentos are around $20-25 range.  I would come here again :)"}
{"text":"Been there for lunch a few times. The food is great and very fresh. The small sushi/sashimi boat is great and more than enough for two very hungry people. We substituted the California roll for spicy tuna which was fantastic. Will be here again. The soup they serve at the beginning is very good too."}
{"text":"okay place for some japanese food. im pretty sure this place is run by koreans.  anyways food wise, it's decent. i feel like their menu lacks variety and there just isn't a whole lot to choose from. oh and it's quite pricey too .... z z   p.s. they have a complimentary orange for you at the end of your meal which i guess is pretty cool (it was hella sour though so LOL)"}
{"text":"Best sushi outside Toronto proper.  Most everything else is of mediocre quality, or is the fast-food equivalent for sushi-- the ubiquitous all-you-can-eat variety.  Great sushi selections-- old stand-bys and some unique creations.  All fresh, with generous portions, all artistically presented."}
{"text":"Finally got to try it after countless recommendations...and was pleasantly pleased!   This is a great spot for lunch with the daily lunch specials, each served with your choice of miso soup or crunchy noodle soup and a solid serving of salad which included beets and arugula! Definitely unique compared to your average Sushi joint.    Highly recommend the Chirashi ($16), if you're a fan of sashimi, which comes with a generous amount of sashimi including 6-8 pieces of salmon sashimi and 2-3 pieces of other types of fish such as tuna and more. The combination of fresh fish served upon a bed of well-seasoned sushi rice makes for an extremely satisfying meal!  The Hae Dup Bap ($14) is also good if you're looking for a more refreshing meal. Essentially the Korean version of Chirashi in which sashimi is diced up and served upon a variety of sliced vegetables with unseasoned white rice on the side (option to mix in to the 'salad' portion'). Best served with gochujang, a Korean sweet and spicy pepper paste sauce!  If you're more of a rolls person, you absolutely have to try the Baked Scallop Roll ($12) which is a fantastic arrangement of scallops, sautéed mushrooms, and green onion on top of California roll with special sauce and let me tell you...dat sauce be special. Even the classic Green Dragon Roll ($13) is presented with decorative display of what seems to be hot sauce, teriyaki sauce and mayo shaped somewhat like a dragon. Not only unique and mind-blowing for the taste buds but also loving the creative touch! Attention to detail is key.  Other tasty options include the One Cup Sashimi ($8-10), Butterfly Shrimp ($10) and Tempura Ice Cream ($5) or Black Sesame Ice Cream ($4) for dessert!   PRO TIPS:  - Arrive early (before 12 for lunch and before 6:30 for dinner) to avoid lineups - Crunchy Noodle Soup to start - Ask for a side of Spicy Mayo  MENU: http://www.tomosushi.ca/sub02_menu/sub0202.php"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after a really long time, -around 8 years.   I was pleasantly surprised to see a complete renovation. I ordered the Sushi Rolls lunch A and it came with avocado rolls, california rolls and salmon sushi.  Though the option for lunch is kind of basic, -the presentation was good. The sushi seemed adequatly fresh and I appreciated the addition of rice noodles in the miso.   The service is great, so I'd definitely consider a return back to Tomo for lunch, though I might go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"our go-to sushi place when my sisters and i are craving sushi. been coming here since it opened. you definitely don't come for the service, though. don't expect them to pay attention. we just come, order our regular rolls and we're out.   our favourite is their Hawaiian roll - it used to be served on a teriyaki plate and set on fire, now its just torched gently. we also loved the sugar mama roll and the wow roll (don't suggest getting those 2 tougher, since they're similar in flavour). if you love spice, get the Russian roulette roll. we loved that they start us off with the crunchy noodle soup, as well! overall, the quality is pretty good, i will say it's not always consistent, there's days you can tell the rice is a tad too hard. however, it is super convenient for us and always helps satisfy our cravings!"}
{"text":"Honestly my favourite sushi restaurant by far. Tends to be a bit pricier than other restaurants but is worth every penny. Highly recommend ordering the crunchy noodle soup. Only negative is that they stopped making the spicy enoki mushroom roll D:"}
{"text":"Tomo Sushi is my favourite sushi spot hands down. I have tried many different sushi places but I always come back to Tomo.  The service is great. usually they have many people working so being waited on is no problem. The snow white roll (may have changed name to snow corn)  is amazing!! The price is a tad high but the quality and quantity make it worth while.   The things I don't like about this place: The tea: has an unpleasant smell and taste seating: many times you have to wait for long periods of time before you get a table and the \"waiting\" area is basically outside.  Highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but it seems like it went down the hill.  The food was just okay-nothing to be too exited about. Also I feel like it wasn't work the price that I paid for it.The service was fast, no complaints here."}
{"text":"Always fresh and good.  Service is great and staff is friendly.    Try the Quinoa rice as an option for the sushi...small upcharge but well worth it.  Healthy alternative to white rice."}
{"text":"you have to try their complimentary crunchy soup it's the only reason I pick this over an all you can eat. The service ain't that bad but the food makes up for it. I usually get take out when I'm in a rush so it's easy to call in and go pick it up right away"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with Tomo as my friend really recommended this place.   However, the food was average and nothing really wowed me. We had ordered a sushi & sashimi set and the sugarmama roll. The sushi and sashimi set had your standard selection of fish but the cuts were not very good. It came with a refreshing salad that was a decent size and a small miso soup. The sugarmama roll was seared white tuna and spicy salmon. It was tasty but the piece of fish was small and thin. They gave us a complimentary crunchy noodle soup that was different than your average miso. Overall, the dishes lacked presentation and \"colour\".   They had a bogo special on oysters that night for fanny bay and kuushi oysters. However, I didn't order any as my boyfriend doesn't really enjoy them.   When I came in, it took the servers a while to decide where to sit us. They ended up talking to each other in korean and it became a little confusing for us. However, the lady who served us was really nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite sushi place. I come here at least twice a month and they always have great service and amazing sushi. The quality is always consistent. You need to try the Crunchy Noodle Soup (complimentary) to start, Snow White Roll, White Dragon Roll and any of their boats. Sometimes it can be a long wait so try and go during the weekdays."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi. Great service as well. If you want something that's not AYCE, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"sushi is fresh!!! a little pricey..but the taste is worth it. the bento  lunch special is a good price. will be coming here... bout 4 types of roll and one bento box.. came to $61... service was really good."}
{"text":"Beautiful deco and friendly servers The sushi is quite good! The rice is excellent and the seaweed has a great texture to it.  The house salad was kind of meh though, didn't taste authentic Japanese, kind of on the Korean side in terms of spices. Also, the food is on the pricy side in terms of portions. Not the best ever food but definitely enjoyable and worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at reasonable prices. Lunch specials are fantastic! Great big booths for parties of 6, but they will seat a party of two there too if you ask nicely (and it isn't busy)."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service was great! I love their unique miso soup. I would come back to try their sushi again."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh, and decent price. 70 pieces combination of maki, nigiri, and sashimi for 73 bucks, great deal compare to US prices. The best part was that all the fish were fresh!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and delicious Japanese cousine.  Highly recomended if you want a quick bite or anice dinner. Quality sushi and sashimi along with other food options."}
{"text":"I ate seated twice, and often order take out. Their sushi is good quality, and though a bit on the higher priced side, in my mind it evens out, because they don't put too much rice like other places. To sum up why I like it so much I would say  CONSISTENCY, they are the most consistent place in RH. Their take out I get holds up so well, it's the same as eating there, which I really appreciate ! They seem to be running a tight ship.  The GOOD: + Consistency + Fish Quality/decent + Take out quality (holds up VERY well) + Service + Wasabi is very potent (you might need to be careful but I like it)  The NOT so GOOD: - Nothing really, could maybe be cheaper or have more combo options + Not worth the \"trip\" if you aren't already in the area.  TIP: We often order the Matsu or Tomo combo, comes with soup and salad, and we are stuffed after, or the chirashi dinner."}
{"text":"I've driven by this location thousands of times and finally decided to give it a try. Sushi here is not ayce and is on the pricey side, but you really do get what you pay for.  I'm not the biggest fan of sashimi, but I must say even this place had me eating sashimi. My friend and I opted for the bento boxes, which was a great way to sample everything Tomo had to offer. Everything in that bento box was delicious. The shrimp/vegetable tempura was fresh, crispy and piping hot. The sashimi was beautifully cut and the gyoza dumplings were fried to crispy perfection. I wasn't too fond of their green salad I must say. A handful of spinach in a bowl is not really a salad, and spinach without dressing tastes really like......spinach. The green salad is calling for some much needed thousand island dressing!  Service was efficient, warm and friendly as they greet you when you walk in. Our cups were never empty and there was always someone close by to call over. A great sushi restaurant indeed."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi and customer service at Tomo Japanese Restaurant is superb. The food here looks good and tastes even better.  I visited this restaurant and shared the 92 piece sushi, sashimi, and maki for dinner. The food was very fresh and the presentation was instagram worthy. The food was served on a wooden board and organized very neatly that it would be a shame not to take a picture.   The atmosphere is nice with friendly and funny staff. One of the staff even challenged us to finish our meal since there was a lot of food. After saying \"Challenge accepted\" and finishing our meal, lets just say, we took out the trash. Jk  The one downside of this restaurant is that it is relatively small. We had a large group so it was pretty hard to get out of our seats and move around. Also, the pricing here is on the higher side so this place is better for special occasions.  In conclusion, I will definitely visit this restaurant again and I recommend this place to you sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I had gone to this place once before a few years ago, and it honestly did not leave much of an impression on me. It was OK...And revisiting this place again now I am left feeling that this place is.....OK again  Service wise, I didnt find this place any more or less attentive then any other non AYCE sushi place. The menu has pretty standard fare, although they do push a bit for their tuna it seems.   Service, the presentation of the food, speed of the food coming out was all ok. The ambiance of the place leans more towards a romantic date night type lighting - Meaning that its mainly dimly lit. And depending on where you sit, you can actually end up in a total dark spot with no light whatsoever as they mainly use pendant lights. So the table we were seated at was actually quite dim since we didnt have a pendant light at all, and we were not able to really appreciate visually the presentation of the food - if there was any.  The quality of the food wasnt terribly bad but also not good either. The uni sushi that we ordered was definitely on the lower end of quality, which was quite disappointing. The uni tasted like the kind of uni you can pick up in T & T, which isnt too impressive for around $9 for 2 pieces of sushi in a sushi restaurant. Personally I also found they seem to use a borderline excessive amount of garnishes. Each portion of sashimi had small sprinklings of a bit of radish garnish, thin slivers of crispy fried fish, and the roll itself had a lot of mayo and eel sauce on top. So really does it taste good? Sure it does, as anything with mayo does. But it really detracts from the rice, seaweed and fish to the point that I question whether the restaurant is trying to hide the quality of their fish. If the fish is fresh, rice good, and seaweed crispy, there should be no real need to use much sauce if any.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I am having a tough time finding any outstanding points, either bad or good. Its a decent place to go, though I would hesitate to come back, and also lack the confidence to refer a friend to try this place. YMMV with going to this place, as reading some other reviews you either really like this place or you dont."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Located in the Laser Quest plaza, the restaurant faces Yonge and you can see the sign while you're driving so it's pretty easy to find.  The decor is nice and modern. It manages not to feel cramped even with a lot of partitions so that you feel like you have some privacy too.  Food is a little on the pricier side but everything we got was quite good and portions were big enough to feel like it was worth it. A friend and I shared a nabeyaki udon ($14) and a sashimi lunch ($16). The nabeyaki udon was good and had various types of seafood in it - mussels, oysters, squid, shrimp, scallop and a piece of tempura (soggy cause of the soup - odd but was okay). A little overpriced I feel for what was a good but not amazing udon.  The sashimi lunch was the one thing on the lunch menu that didn't describe what was in the meal. So we were pleasantly surprised when got a bento with rice, salad, gyoza, tofu, and California rolls. The meal also already comes with a large salad and miso soup. The sashimi was plated very nicely. It tasted fresh and included salmon, tuna, something I didn't know, and torched butterfish. No complaints here!  Overall pretty good. Paid about $20 and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch with my mom on a freezing winter day and we each ordered a bowl of udon noodles, shrimp tempura for my mom and spicy seafood for me and we shared a collection of a la carte sushi.    The service was efficient but indifferent and I didn't particularly enjoy the way our server who was much younger than my mom kept addressing her in \"informal\" Korean.    They served a complimentary crunchy noodle soup in tiny bowls which would have been much more appreciated had we not been waiting for big bowls of udon noodles.  They tasted fine, nothing special, your usual run of the mill out-of-the-flavour-packet broth and some tempura batter thrown in with thin somen (white noodles).    Our udons arrived some 25 min after ordering and not having sampled my mom's, I can only say that my spicy seafood udon, otherwise known as Jjampong for most Koreans, was wayyyyyyyyyyy too salty.  I felt like I was getting a headache after a few slurps of the soup so I opted to clear just the noodles, veggies and some shriveled up seafood bits and left most of the broth.    Our a la carte sushi arrived and I was not happy about the fact that they had torched our scallops, sea bream and escolar without asking us.  If I wanted torched sushi, I would have gone elsewhere and ordered it as such.  The torching masqueraded the quality of at least the escolar and the sea bream and I didn't particularly enjoy it.  The botan ebi was on the small side but good nonetheless and so was maguro.    I'm not sure if I would be in a hurry to come back here to sample more sushi as there are far better sushi joints around.  This lunch set us back just under $100 with 15% tip.  Not very good value for lunch."}
{"text":"sushi/sashimi boat $42 pretty standard stuff nice large pieces of sashimi I was expecting some more variety of sashimi to be included like octopus, red clam or even better parts of the salmon like the belly the fish was pretty fresh but you can find this kind of freshness in sushi almost anywhere now"}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Tomo, visiting on average monthly over the past five years.   This used to be our favourite place for sushi and bento boxes however a recent visit this past Friday left us feeling that there is distinct change in terms of quality and preparation.   We always make reservations as otherwise, if visiting during prime dinner hours, one can expect a minimum 30 minute wait. Diners seated in the main area subject to enjoy their meal while watching those without reservations crowed the entire front of the restaurant.   Spicy roll set has gotten smaller in size and the rolls were falling apart. The salmon seemed not the quality we are used to seeing from Tomo.   Their crunchy noodle soup is still one of my favourite aspects of this restaurant.   I would give this a 3.5 stars. We will be back as we are hoping this was just a one-off experience."}
{"text":"Just one thing to review: the small sushi, sashimi and roll combo for 47 which came with like 10-12 pieces of each thing. Non-fishy smelling fish aka everything was quite fresh. Definitely a lot of food, especially if you're dining with a more petite person like I did"}
{"text":"After visiting many famous sushi places around the world I can confidently say - Its one of the best sushi places. Always fresh fish, exceptional service, amazing presentation and reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 3.5 because it's not like they're actually horrible but their quality if definitely is not as fantastic as other places around this area.  Their quantity is abundant and usually when I order one of their lunch combos, it is awesome because I have enough for dinner as well.   I would stay away from their fried rice but otherwise, everything seems decent.  Would definitely go again for convenience :)"}
{"text":"It's been ages since we've been to Tomo and I was a bit shocked by the increases in prices. That said the quality is very high and the service pretty good, so it was fair.  That crunch noodle soup is one of my favourites and it was complimentary! The shrimp and vegetable tempura were delicious and beautifully presented. We also had the small sushi, sashimi and roll combination which was yummy."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant so we go on a regular basis.  The service is always excellent and fast and the crunchy noodle soup is delicious!!  The one thing I don't rave about is their tempura.  Although not greasy it is tasteless and there is way too much batter for my liking.  Good value.."}
{"text":"How the years have changed this establishment never ceases to amaze me.  What was once given complimentary is now at a cost.    The reason I gave Tomos 5 stars before was because of that attention to detail, quality of service, and the perks that for the price you were paying you received little things like an extra bowl of house soup or a better quality cut of sushi.    Recent visits to Tomos has revealed it to be on par with all the other sushi places in the area.  It no longer rises above the rest.  Unfortunately for Tomo, the other places are less expensive and if I am at the end of the day paying for exactly the same service and food - then why would I go here?"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time yesterday as a party of 3...seen Tomo Sushi around for some time and it is quite close to home but never crossed my mind to try this place out until I looked up the yelp rating.  We ordered a small size sushi, sashimi and roll boat (40 pieces) and a sugar mama roll, miso soup was included.  The sushi was decent, fresh fish (I think there was salmon, red tuna, tuna, seared tuna, california roll, salmon roll). The most notable item was the sugar mama roll, it was delicious...seared tuna on top of a scallop roll with crispies and mayo inside. YUM!  As we got the bill we got four slices of juicy watermelon.  The portions here are not too big, it was just about right size for as none of us were incredibly hungry."}
{"text":"Have been going here for quite some time...since before they changed ownership and expanded into the part of the restaurant next door.  Tomo offers a great mixture of Japanese and Korean choices. They've recently added a few new maki rolls and other dishes to the menu and everything I've tried has been quite good.  My kids love the crunchy noodle soup they give you as a freebie before the meal. That's a nice departure from serving miso soup or serving no soup, which is the standard at other places.  Their maki rolls are the best in town. Not too big, not too small. They add some type of sauce that makes their maki taste distinct and recognizable. The first time you try it, you don't notice anything special. However, once you've dined at Tomo and decide to visit a different place next time, you find yourself craving that roll from Tomo.   If you are into raw fish and spicy stuff, try Hae Dup Pap, which a Korean bowl of rice with veggies and assorted fish on top. The sauce that comes with it doesn't hit you with heat right away. In the beginning, you hardly feel the spice at all. However, as you get closer to the end of the mean, you're almost breathing fire.   it seems like they've been rotating through some younger sous-chef a lot recently and the food has not always been consistent. If these guys haven't been apprenticing long enough, the in-house recipe may end up not being followed a T. A couple of our visits were disappointing, i.e. the rolls tasted like they were picked up at a grocery store.  We wouldn't think much of it if we were visiting some other sushi place. However, we know Tomo to be the best in town and set our expectations pretty high when we go there.   This is one of the places we take our friends when they visit us."}
{"text":"As per the other reviews, freshness, attention to detail, & service is what really stood out at this a la carte!    Salad was fresh - not just stuffed in the bowl and stored for hours in a fridge, the option of getting a crunch noodle miso - as opposed to the regular miso was nice, tea constantly being refilled, & a deliciously sweet orange to cap off the meal!  (I usually don't really care for the post-meal fruit, but for some reason, this sliced orange was really refreshing!)  Lunch specials were really good value with nice, large portions.  Unfortunately, my sis ordered a special 'contemporary' roll which was slathered in sauces + I didn't order any rolls myself, so I can't speak on the quality of the fish, but it sure LOOKED fresh 'n vibrant!  Service was gentle, a nice change of pace from the turn 'n burn places."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my older sister. We were craving sushi and wanted to try Tomo again seeing as the last time was a very omg time ago. We had the Kaiso salad to start, the shiitake soup, and wonton soup with biggie dumplings. Overall the appetizers were good, but the portions small. As our entre we had the rainbow dragon roll and and rocky roll. Both good as well, I wish there was more!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the great sushi evidence we had here! Shared four rooms and an appetizer and we were stuffed to the gills.. Couldn't even finish! Great value for money even if this is not all you can eat. The sushi was very fresh, the service was prompt and refreshingly friendly (better than average). Tasteful decor right down to the washrooms. Give it a go if you're in the area and try the sushi tempura room which is the one I enjoyed the most!"}
{"text":"I had a very comfortable experience in this comfortable restaurant that resonated an old \"Pizza Hut\". The Tofu Bento box was finger-licking good. The sushi rolls were good and the \"spicy\" tempura-Ed tofu, although like vanilla ice cream to my experienced South Asian buds, left me \" licking my platter clean\".The Wasabi however, was an entirely a different experience;The spiciest and most pungent \"sabi\" I've ever tried. My server, \"Jenny from the block\", was courteous and prompt. Dessert was an excellent plate of a very fresh Navel orange. Good sushi, good experience."}
{"text":"Very good food, but I wish the restaurant looked nicer. It's a bit cramped and tables are so close to each other. It kind of gives you the feeling that you have to rush and leave for others to sit. Very good food regardless."}
{"text":"It's tough giving this place two stars - but after some thought, 2.5 is the best i can give this place based on my visit.   As an a la carte sushi restaurant, price points and in reading reviews, i was expecting this place to be a tiny bit more refined. I spent $95 (pre-tip) on food with no alcohol on dinner for two. I had 5 items.... I was served with plastic cups, sticky plates, rushed and minimal service.   If i'm dishing out $50 per head.... i'd at least appreciate an actual glass and non food-court service.   My point really - it's not an all you can eat sushi place, but definitely feels like one. For marginally better food quality than an AYCE, you're better of just going to one and saving yourself the poor experience. If i'm going to spend some money on a place i expect to be better than an AYCE, i think i'm better off just going downtown to a place that i know affords a much better experience at that price point (Ki, JaBistro, Blowfish, etc).  They put a lot of effort into the presentation of the food, it's obvious, but that same attitude doesn't flow through the entire experience. There's also a lack of quality control and care for the customer in general. I was knowingly served sushi and sashimi that sat in a window prepared for half an hour prior to. Who does that? We're dealing with raw fish here and strict Ontario guidelines....i'm definitely never going back."}
{"text":"I personally was not a fan of their sushi, the first place I went to in Richmond Hill had much fresher fish.   I liked the variety in the rolls, though the prices were definitely higher (around 12-17 dollars for a specialty roll). The rolls are VERY big though.   These are the four rolls I ordered:  Go Train Roll: Deep fried salmon-topped avocado roll with unagi sauce ($12) - I liked this roll the best, probably because it had LOTS of avocado, was tempura friend perfectly, but the salmon already tasted a bit overly-fishy/low quality for a cooked roll, so this should have been a warning sign.  Angry Tuna Roll: Deep fried roll with spicy tuna, avocado, and banana pepper ($13) - I really enjoyed this one as well, the banana pepper gave it a fun twist I wasn't expecting.  Red Dragon Roll: Salmon, avocado on dynamite (shrimp tempura, avocado, kappa and massage with unagi) ($15) - I peeled the salmon off this one because it was cut very thick and didn't taste fresh. Otherwise, it was ok.  Las Vegas Roll - Dynamite with cream cheese roll, tuna, salmon and avocado ($16) - Also peeled the fish off the top of this one because the tuna was the same color as the salmon, not the deep red I felt it should be. I also generally like a roll with cream cheese every now and again but something just wasn't good with this one. I threw most of it away.  In general, I think the quality of the fish is not as good as other places in the area, and the prices was a bit steep for the quality.  I likely won't go back because I have already tried better sushi close by that has a better value and better quality, there's just SO many options, no need to settle on mediocre."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in York Region. The quality of the food is only surpassed by the attention to detail in presentation and ambiance. The staff is friendly, attentive and hospitable, and the food speaks for itself. This is all reflected in the price of the food, as it is fairly expensive, but no corners are cut. They offer some very interesting 'contemporary maki' that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. If you like it spicy, I highly recommend the Russian Roulette Roll."}
{"text":"Finally made it out here. Had the Salmon Sashimi, Sushi, Roll lunch. And the Gold Dragon roll. The Sashimi slices were epic. It's gonna be hard going back to some of my other haunts now.   The Gold Dragon was ridiculous. One of those rolls were you're not sure what's going on, but you like it, you roll with it. It didn't hurt that it was also one of the best looking rolls I've ever seen.   It's better than Mi-Ne. So unless I missed something, that puts it right up there with the best places in Richmond Hill. (at least on Yonge St.)  4.5 stars. (extra .5 is for the complimentary crunchy tempura noodle soup. mmm)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat some rolls! Their rolls are over sized to HUGE! So 2 soups and 3 rolls are more than enough for a big lunch or dinner for 2. Many original and very tasty rolls to choose from! The price is $$$$ ($60 with tax and tip for two), so that's the only reason i will give 4 stars. Will return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Tomo is awesome! Great fast service. The angry salmon roll is my favourite special roll.   The tuna tartar and salmon sushi are also very light and fresh. You can definitely tell Tomo uses good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I would say average. Nothing really wowed me but it was definitely fast and nice decor. Service was.good too.  Probably won't go again though. Too many other choices."}
{"text":"Came by with some work peeps for lunch and we we're pretty impressed!  Our office just moved 20 minutes north and we're now separated from our usual go to sushi place  what's heartbroken in Japanese?  We came here to see what it was all about and I must say, we'll be back for sure!  Their crunchy noodle soup was interesting. Not something you typically see in a sushi menu but it was pretty good! A nice change from your usual miso soup.   I had a salmon avocado roll and from the first bite, you can tell that this place is quality sushi. Significantly better than your AYCE sushi and one step below my all time face place (check my other reviews)  It wasn't t terribly busy either so service was great. Can't comment on how they are once the place is packed but I'll be sure to update this review when that happens.   Looking forward to our next \"business\" lunch outing!"}
{"text":"There are better Japanese restaurants out there than this place. Their sushi and roll boat lacks variety and thickness. For the price I'm paying ($42 for a small), I expected more than salmon and chopped up tuna. I almost thought they served the wrong table when it arrived.  I have never been to a Japanese restaurant where an order of sushi boat has more than half of it is salmon.  I'm surprised a couple of friends had recommended this, if only I had seen some of the picture posted on Yelp before I attended! Needless to say, I won't be back! If you are dragged there for some reason, I gave them an extra star for their beef sashimi, try it!"}
{"text":"I go here almost every week, im somewhat of a self proclaimed sushi addict. I love Tomo for many reasons, besides the obvious ones including their amazing food quality and service, i love how the waiters and waitresses all greet us when we walk in the door and always know what im going to order.  My favourite is the salmon avocado roll on brown rice or the dynamite roll. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that they have low sodium soy sauce. The crunchy noodle soup is also an added plus that they always include as a complimentary appetizer as well as fresh cut oranges to finish off your meal. I have never been disappointed by this place. Definitely by favourite sushi spot in richmond hill. :)"}
{"text":"Tomo, for me, stands out as one of the better upscale sushi restaurants in Richmond Hill. The quality of their sushi is consistently good. The portions are small in contrast to other places but the ingredients they use are of substantially higher quality. Also they cut their fish quite thick and their rolls are pretty large.   I like their lunch specials and bento boxes. For example, \"Lunch Special A\" is $10 and gives you 11 pieces (assorted salmon and tuna) with a soup and salad. The presentation is another thing I like about Tomo's sushi. It's something you miss out on with the AYCEs."}
{"text":"This review is coming a few months late, but we had be coming to Tomo for years and was our go-to spot for a guaranteed great meal and service. However, it is evident there has been some management or ownership change as our last visit was absolutely ridiculous. Staff that took orders from tables that came after us and we had to flag them down to order. And also, we had requested gluten free option for a boat we were ordering, which was accommodated without question previously (ie no fake crab meat and hold the sauce). And then they kept saying it wasn't possible because the rice had gluten in it. They clearly do not know what gluten is.  After much debate and confusion on their part, we had our meal. However there was no service at all, they didn't clear any plates and didn't offer to refill our tea, everything had to be asked for. There was no initiative on the server at all. I also saw an empty table that still had a stack of dirty plates the employees didn't bother clean up.  When we were done, we asked for the bill 3x and took 15 mins to get the bill. Clearly, we had our credit card ready but she just dropped off the bill and walked away, never to be seen again. So I had to walk up to the cash register and ask to pay. Another person who was there said she will send my server to my table  and I can have a seat. I said no, I want to pay right here, right now and I have already waited far too long.   I will never go back to this place and there are so many better sushi restaurants in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"This place has some pretty surprisingly fresh sashimi. The price is pretty decent too for the quality of food you are getting.  Although it's still not my #1 pick for Japanese food, but it's still up there amongst my favourite. Will definitely be back if I'm craving for Jap in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi in the GTA.  I have eaten at very high end sushi restaurants in Toronto as well, like Ki at BCE place.  This place is way better.  It's pretty pricey and DOES NOT offer all you can eat, which is a sign of their quality.  The price is high for sushi in the suburbs, but the quality and presentation is amazing."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials! Lunch Specials!  Yes Tomo sushi has lunch specials starting from $7.95! The selections includes both Japanese and Korean items.  We decided to try one Japanese and Korean Lunch Set: Chirashi Sushi ($14.95) and Kalbi/Grilled Beef ribs ($8.95).  The Kalbi set comes with miso soup, salad, pumpkin and tofu tempura and 6 pieces of beef ribs. I have to they all tasted pretty good! Really good price for the food!  Chirashi Sushi has a general serving of raw fish: 14 pieces and artfully presented. The fish are fresh and tasty.. However, I have to say it is not as good as the Chirashi I have at Zen http://www.yelp.ca/biz/zen-japanese-restaurant-scarborough#hrid:V5--da17VL0GVCxdYTnCbA  The service is fast and friendly. I would definitely be back again for lunch to try out others items on the lunch menu!  They accepts Interac, Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Normally we love Tomo. We have been going here for 6 years. so giving them a poor rating breaks my heart. We have eaten here three times since they have changed the menu and we have been disappointed each time.  The quality and taste of the cooked food has become bland. The spicy chicken teriyaki is not spicy at all and the Yakiudon noodles have a lot of oil.  Their sushi rolls and fish remain good.  I hope they find away to return to their previous standard of excellence.  They have also increased their prices a lot with the new menu"}
{"text":"If you like Bento boxes, you should come to Tomo Japanese Restaurants. I came here once with my family for lunch and we were all very satisfied with the food.  Price is reasonable as well. Bento boxes ranges from $10 -$20 (vegetarian bentos are cheaper)."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my food second time around. They got two of our rolls wrong and didn't replace them. Worst service I have received.. How unfortunate."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese Restaurant. Anything you want from authentic to creative. Must try is their house crunchy noodle soup"}
{"text":"Best sushi in RH and my fav restaurant. People are friendly, chefs are great. I always over order since I like to try everything! Try the Russian roulette , it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I find this place too expensive and not worth it .  I ordered chicken teriyaki bento with shrimp tempura for $23.00.  The chicken is dry and may have been previously cooked and grilled to have the grill marks. Tasted like the grill was not cleaned and tasted burnt.  Had only two slices and didn't eat the rest of the chicken.  Sushi are smaller than usual.  Hubby ordered the sashimi dinner and boy, they are thinly sliced.  Just my observation butthere are several empty seats around and we got seated in a wet table.  Crumbs on the seats. The floor below has not been swept clean.  Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"A regular visitor at Tomo. Staff is friendly , fish is fresh,  and many options for all.  From brown rice to quinoa , tomo is also upgrading to healthier options to suite every individual need"}
{"text":"This is often a go to sushi restaurant for my husband and I. The sashimi is always great quality and always fresh. The rolls are smaller than some other restaurants but they always taste amazing. Staff and service also very attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Delicious! One of my favourite places for sushi in the area. A little pricier than your average sushi joint, but the food's taste and presentation make it worth while for a night you want to treat yourself. Do yourself a favour and try the crunch noodle soup and spicy salmon roll!"}
{"text":"The first time I dropped by was for take out seeing as it gets seriously busy on weekend evenings. There's a lineup that seems to go on forever so I'd steer clear of evenings if you don't want to wait half an hour to be seated. I got the Black Dragon Roll for take out and it was pretty good. The pieces are perfect size, not too big to eat whole but not small either. The only downside is that I still had to wait half an hour before they finished my order. It seems to me that many people call ahead to order and come pick up later which seems ideal actually.  The second time I came with a friend just as it opened for lunch. We came on a Monday and surprisingly it fills up really quickly so I'd say if you want to come for lunch, don't wait up! I ordered the Orangeville roll and it was very yummy! I also ordered the 10 piece assorted sashimi plate which was very fresh (only downside was the bias for salmon and red tuna slices which I found mildly disappointing compared to the White tuna).   For dessert, I got the mango tempura ice cream (they only had mango much to my chagrin as I'm not really a fan of it) but it was mediocre at best. The cake layer was way too sweet so you couldn't even taste anything past that. I've had better.   Overall service was good. Will come back again though maybe only for takeout."}
{"text":"Best best sushi in Richmond Hill!! It's become my favourite for eat in and take out.  Besides the sashimi, try the green dragon rolls, spider rolls and PEI rolls.  The good is so fresh and it's like butter.  Staff are busy but friendly.  Great atmosphere in the restaurant and if ordering take out, they have great platters and selection.  I have been there now several times and will definitely become a regular!"}
