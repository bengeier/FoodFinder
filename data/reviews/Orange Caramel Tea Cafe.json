{"text":"Guys, I went back recently and there may have been a change in ownership? or new cook?
The lady we usually see isn't there anymore and the food doesn't taste as it used to.
It also took forever for an order of street toast."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday afternoon with two other friends, and the three of us sat for hours! 

I ordered the Pomegranate Green Tea, with the Belgian Waffle Combo, for $9.99. I was extremely satisfied with everything, and the staff checked up on us often for refills. The atmosphere was really nice, and free wifi was a plus!

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Cute place, large clean tables, just a few steps from Finch station. Great for groups!

Cute touches on everything - utensils and plates/cups are adorable. If you order tea you get a little hourglass timer that tells you how long to steep the tea, etc.

Desserts are good, nothing special but yummy.

Decent prices - $8 for a waffle, $3.50 for coffee, etc.

Polite and friendly service. Nice place all around."}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good! 
Street toast, waffles, everything. Atmosphere is good too... any place with couches is my kind of place. 
My only complaint is that it always seems to be boiling hot inside."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! It is a step up from other Cafes I have been to in this style. The only problem I had with it is that I felt kind of like an alien being there. The staff avoided my table, and didn`t make eye contact with us. I would still go again besides that awkward experience.

(Also can`t say I recomend the sweet potato late, but it was interesting experience none the less)."}
{"text":"It is a cute little cafe located near the Finch subway station. It's easy to miss as it's on the first floor and you have to be looking for it to find it.
They have have their tea menu divided into Black Tea, Green Tea, White Tea and Herbal Tea.
The tea are in the range ~3-5 $. And they'll refill the premium teas 4 times.
They have a few books to read on different subjects both in English and Chinese. They have some games too like Chess, Uno etc.
The wifi is also available for the guests to use. And it's open till midnight in summers.
Students are their main clientele and May-Sep is their slow season, if you're looking for some quiet time.
The owner is from South Korea and is nice to talk to. We didn't order food so can't comment on it. The tea was nice. They were using Samadoyo teapots (Japanese imports) which are very nice and fairly expensive. They'll provide the sand timer to keep track of the infusion time for your tea."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this place!~

The food is delicious and I got the window seat last time I went and it was just so relaxing! staff is friendly and very welcoming. the price isn't so bad either! I would go again if I'm looking for a place to relax and have some cake and tea!~"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I recommend the sofa seats by the window if you can get them! I came here for dessert and a drink, but was surprised to see that they had a really enticing lunch menu with items ranging from pasta to steak. They advertised that their chef graduated from George Brown culinary, so I have high expectations for their  food items on my return trip!

On this visit, I got a green tea pancake, along with a sweet potato latte and my bf got an order of garlic bread and iced vanilla latte. I admit the drinks are expensive, but in this case, I think the inflated drink price makes up for the time that people spend just sitting here to hang out. I loved my sweet potato latte, (btw, it's a popular Korean drink for those who think it's really weird) and you can tell that it was made from a real sweet potato too. The bf's vanilla latte was also refreshing, but a bit on the sweet side in my opinion. The pancake was kind of bittersweet. The pancake itself was quite good, but they added this green apple drizzle on top that I didn't appreciate at all. (My bf really liked it though, so I think this was a matter of taste). I was really impressed with the garlic bread though. It sounds like such a simple dish, but instead of the typical herbs the owner/chef seasoned it with black pepper which added a sweetness/spice to it that I don't normally expect from garlic bread. 

Overall, love the ambiance and cozy nature of this little cafe. Can't wait to try more of their savoury food items soon!"}
{"text":"It's a cosy dessert place close to Finch station. Staff is very friendly. Store has a bunch of sofas, tables, etc; as well as a bookshelf full of books (mainly Korean). 

Got  a Belgian waffle combo, which comes with 2 Belgian waffles (incl ice cream) and an Americano for $8. It was big and also was quite tasty. Also got a dessert crepe which was really good (also $8). 

Next time I come I'll try the tea (and get another crepe or waffle). 

Accepts credit card"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this cafe. It's so cozy and there's so many comfy couches to sit on. It's the perfect spot for a date, to study, or just catch up with friends. I've tried a bunch of their teas/drinks, and they're all good to be honest. I like how they give it to you in a small pot, and the sand timer is super helpful. I also really like their desserts. I'll definitely continue to come here :)"}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the owner is very attentive and friendly. I enjoy their vast selection of teas and the egg sandwich is amazing. It's the perfect place for a date or as a study group."}
{"text":"I'll start this review off with it being a great cafe.It's a cozy friendly environment with couches and comfy chairs to relax on. You can pick up random books and magazines to read if  you'd like, along with a couple of card/board games. A nice quiet place to chill with your friends or to study while sipping on some tea.

I ordered the Belgian waffle with chocolate drizzle, which was alright. My friend order the American version and it seemed like that was the large \"Eggo\" version. Got a side of Cafe Latte which was milky and smooth. I would recommend getting the American version since it's  larger and more crisp than the Belgian version. 

I wouldn't mind coming back here and try other foods in their extensive menu."}
{"text":"A big thing for me is when a place offers are great overall experience. It's not enough to just have good food, especially for places like cafe's where people hangout. Rather than restaurants where people usually just pass through quickly. 

This place delivers on many levels that most bubble tea places don't. 

Very comfortable seating, and cute decor. Fast internet. Exceptional food quality. Quiet ambiance. 

It just feels so comfortable here. 

The only potential negatives are that the menu is smallish(but the place is small anyway). In terms of milk tea there are few options. If you are a hardcore milk tea fanatic and need a hundred options for your milk tea like cha time then this isn't the place for you. They offer many other kinds of drinks anyway. 

But if you need a cool place to hangout, have awesome food, or study. This place is for you."}
{"text":"This place used to be hard to find due to the small sign. Recently they added a bigger sign so it should be easy to find. Before they had this sign, it wasn't immediately obvious that it's a cafe. It's on the 2nd floor. I'm glad I found this place a year ago.

I've been here 3 times. This is a great cafe to go to if you like tea. Compared to other cafes in the area, Orange Caramel has a very good selection of tea. They serve you the tea in this hourglass timer thing which is very cute. The servers are happy to add more hot water for you. 

Cafes need good atmosphere and this one delivers. The owner and most of their customers are Korean so you'll hear Korean music. The decor is pretty good and the chairs are comfortable. 

I haven't tried their food items so no comments there. I generally don't get food at cafes and just stick with a drink. I haven't tried their other drinks either. I'm a tea kind of guy. 

No review by me is complete without a commentary on price. Perhaps the best selling point of this place is that their teas are not expensive. Some places charge you $5-6 for tea. This place sells specialty tea at prices lower than all the other tea shops in the Yonge/Finch area. 

Highly recommended for tea lovers."}
{"text":"This cute little cafe is actually up a flight of stairs and is conveniently right next to finch station. 

I remember when I came, it wasn't that busy. The server who I assumed was the owner gave us menus but I ended up ordering at the front because the owner was busy making other people's orders. My friend and I ended up sharing a waffle...I forgot what the waffle was called (this happened almost a year ago). I remember the waffle was good but not something memorable. I also ordered a sweet potato latte because that's my favourite drink to get at Korean cafes lol. And that was good. 

Anyway, this place is good for catch ups with your friends!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem that I happened to stumble upon!

Everything here is gourmet. Owner is a graduate from a culinary school. Photos in the menu don't do justice to what you will actually get.

Prices are reasonable. Comfy couches. Super cozy. K-pop playing in the background. Free WiFi.

Gourmet taste on a cafeteria budget. I strongly recommend that you visit this location if you are ever near Finch."}
{"text":"This is my favourite uptown dessert place!  I do my best to try a different item each time I visit, and have not been disappointed!  Soft Korean ballads play in the back; if you watch Kdramas - def play the \"which OST does this song belong to?\" game.

The crepes are a light spongey texture that is a dream to bite into.
Their waffles are plated beautifully - I dare you not to drool
If you're a tea enthusiast, you will find a blend that will peak your interest.
The green tea smoothes are a great chilled drink to sip on during a warm summer.

Gosh, I'm so in love with this place!  They even allow you to bring board games into the cafe to play~  (the shelf left to the cashier has a few packs of cards and one or two games.)

The ambiance is largely dictated by which demographic is the majority at the time.  There have been times I've come in with friends and have felt awkward with the lovey-dovey romantic vibes.  Similarly, I've come here with my boyfriend and had to speak over tables of girlfriends chatting with each other.

Deducted one star because I have visited on two separate occasions and have been refused to order certain items [waffles] because the chef was not present at the time.  Perhaps label certain item's availability?  I'm still waiting for the day where I can introduce my friends to their delicious american waffles!  ;("}
{"text":"Great food and drinks but terrible service.  Had to ask for things three times, wanted to share a tea pot with a friend but the boss didn't let me as she said each tea pot is for one person... Was willing to pay extra for a cup but she refused and asked if we've ever been to other cafés.. .  Then when the bill seemed off,  it took four tries to correct the items that she double charged us.  Absolutely terrible.  Always double check the bill here..."}
{"text":"Cozy, comfortable atmosphere. Great for studying or casual reading. Unfortunately, after a number of visits I was left disappointed each time due to very expensive poor quality drinks."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little cafe Right beside the KIMS OPTICAL~ 

 Orange Caramel Tea Cafe specializes in  loose leaf tea and they have a really nice selection of summer Sherbets!! You can get a small for one Person for $6.00 and a large fro 2 for 8.50$ I recommend this if you come with a friend! Getting a big one to share would be way cheaper!!! 

I have tried the coffee sherbert which was a fantastic teat!! Coffee flavored shaved ice with almonds and cereal on the side including a decent size scoop of chocolate ice-cream on top with a chocolate drizzle!! 

The Decor inside is very lovely as well!! It's a lovely Orangey-Brown color scheme. With brick wall of brown to beige bricks and furniture of the same color to match !!

If you have ever been to cafe princess this cafe would be a similar but a more upscale atmosphere!! I would say this is the mature version of cafe princess!!"}
{"text":"Yummy desserts. The desserts weren't too sweet and their portions are very generous. In comparison to other dessert place in the block, with the same price point, this is hands down more sweets for your buck. We were all surprised and were wondering if they made a mistake and made two portions each. I mean, it's not ridiculously ginormous, but a lot more than what we are accustomed to getting when we get desserts from other tea shops. 

I will definitely go back here again and I highly recommend it. I'll order the honey butter toast next time."}
{"text":"Very good place to sit down and do some work ... We were at soban that day but the internet was bad kept logging me on and off multiple times so we decided to go to this place the internet very good and the lady serving is amazing so friendly ... The way she bring the order is unique she gave me a sand watch yo wait 5 min for my Italiano to get really ... Over all I will recommend this place it is some how hidden"}
{"text":"The Belgian Waffle was way off - tasted like wet, undercooked bread. The coffee icecream and bananas were good though. 

The Dessert Crepe was too thick and I didn't like the vanilla icecream and green sauce. 

The space feels like someone's home, with comfortable mismatched couches."}
{"text":"Small and cozy place located on the 2nd floor. Seating is mostly on old sofa's/ couches. Picture the old fashion couches that you'll find in your grandparents house. The seats were soft and comfy to lay back and relax on but difficult when trying to eat from the table. 

Belgian waffle+latte combo $11.99 - the waffle was pretty big and came with sliced banana's, a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate. The waffle was not light and fluffy like I thought it would be. It was a bit hard and had a plain flavour to it. The latte tasted watered down at first but if you give it a good stir it tasted much better since the milk sank to the bottom. You cannot choose your own flavour of latte. It just comes with the standard one the make for you.

Sweet potato latte $6.99 - it tasted like sweet milk. There was definitely sweet potato in it as you can feel the fibers of the sweet potato in the drink. 

Overall, the desserts/drinks I had were okay at best.

Service was good as they were not too busy on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"My most recent visit here, I ordered the cheesecake which is like 4.99$ for a slice. However this time, I received barely a slice so it definitely isn't worth the price. This was quite disappointing, I guess I'll have to satisfy my cheesecake craving elsewhere.

But the Iced latte was still good as usual and of course free wifi is a definite plus!"}
{"text":"Very unique place.  Quite and could be a good place to study.  

Food is slightly on the higher side but food was good."}
{"text":"This is one of the homiest, coziest cafes I have ever been to. It is conveniently located minutes away from Finch station. Once you arrive you have to walk up a narrow set of stairs. Inside there are plenty of large sized couches, and it feels like home. There is a good selection of lattes, loose leaf teas, waffles, dessert, and savoury crepes filled with ham and cheese to choose from. Howver we decided to try the sweet potato pizza because it seemed unique.

The sweet potato pizza contains rectangular/cube sized yellow sweet potatoes laid out nicely on what a bed of cheese, tomatoe sauce, corn, and peas. The bottom layer I believe is some kind of frozen bread that was heated up/baked.

*Note that the pizza does not come with a crust*
It was served warm and made a good snack for sharing. The dish itself is served on a metal rack.

As for the drink I am not sure what we got because we asked for a surprise. But I believe it was a korean tea latte. It tasted like some kind of korean tea mixed with milk. A little watery but it had a unique tea taste to it and was topped with nice layer of foam on top. There are some books and magazines as well. Some are dated though. There are some games like chess, a deck of cards as well. Definitely a good place to go to relax."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. Love the decor as well. It makes you feel like you are hanging out at your best friends house sipping some delicious beves. The waffles are also amazing. I have never been to a cafe quiet like this one! Wish more people knew about it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Orange Caramel is cute, romantic, and gives off a very Korean vibe. It's something you'd expect to see in K dramas (although I don't watch them).

Service was patient and friendly. They helped us with our order when we needed recommendations. 

The desserts and drinks arrived after 15-20 minute wait. I was quite surprised about the wait time for such a tiny cafe. Everything we ordered required no heat (all ice and liquid).

The shaved ice and drinks were average and a bit  over priced. There are way too many options in this area for shaved ice and Asian beverages.

I would re-visit for the lovely environment, but definitely not for the menu."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars*

It's a bonus that this cafe is literally 1 minute walk away from the station, on the 2nd floor of the B&B hair salon. 

Immediately when we entered the cafe, we were greeted by the staff. The atmosphere was great and surprisingly, there weren't a lot of people on a Friday evening. We were lucky that we got to sit in the two comfy couches at the back. 

The green tea latte was absolutely delicious ($5.99). It did give a bitter aftertaste, especially near the bottom, but I didn't really mind that. My friend ordered the sweet potato pizza ($9.99) and it was alright. It was just bread, smeared with tomato sauce, meat?, corn and cheese. My friend also got the Genmatcha Tea ($3.49) and it was interesting how they give you a sand timer to steep the tea. 

The downside was probably the price. I thought the drinks/food were quite expensive. But then there wasn't really a time limit to how long you could stay there...

Overall, I really enjoyed being there. I could see myself coming back to this cafe, studying or reading, in those comfy couches :)"}
{"text":"Came here today as I was looking for a cafe space to work in and always looking out for great meeting spaces to bring clients to. After climbing a tall flight of stairs, it feels like one of those comfy lofts with great seating, well lit and clean. 

I ordered a Coconut Cream Tea, Vanilla Latte and a American Style Waffle with Blueberries and Coffee Ice Cream. 

The tea was interesting and delicious! Just the right amount of flavour and aroma, presented in a nice tea set with timer. The Latte is the typical 'euro' sized cup, which for some might be too little in quantity but it felt just right with espresso kick and vanilla flavour. Definitely much better than the typical over-sweetened/flavoured Starbucks/Second Cup. 

Waffle was perfect, fluffy and fresh with the right amount of topping. 

Ambience is great but my only nag would be the sound system. Satellite speakers rely on the subwoofer that's a bit too boomy for a cafe environment, borderlining lounge/club feel. Larger speakers or something with better range would work much better, feel not as noisy at the same volume. 

Overall, great place and definitely will be coming back as a great meeting spot for work!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I always thought this cafe does not exist. The phone number is out if service (647 is the correct # now... pls see tips!), nothing online indicates their opening hours... well, Urbanspoon is inaccurate!) The only way I know is by the activities on Facebook and through updates on Yelp! I'm so glad I have made it here because this cafe is definitely a hidden gem in the heart of North York - subway accessible, located at NE of Yonge and Finch :D

My friends and I have decided to go dessert hoping on a chilly Monday night. We got to our last stop at Orange Caramel around 10:45pm... but to find out that they close at 11pm D: You know that feeling when customers walk in 10 mins before closing time, and you just want to strangle them LMAO. The lady owner was so nice, took us in and welcomed us to stay until 11:30pm while she cleans up.

First impression - Cutest little upstairs cafe ever! It feels so warm and homey right when you walk up those stairs, lid with Christmas lights :3 Lots of comfy chairs and couches, with stuffed animals (huge Curious George!!) and cutesy decorations!

Our initial plan was to try their desserts (green tea pancakes, crepes and waffles, sundaes... yum!). But since we were out of time, we quickly ordered some easy-to-prepare items (steeped tea and cheesecakes), just to satisfy our cravings for now. The lady owner said all their tea leaves are organic (I was very excited to find out that they have decaf too!) AND the cheesecakes were freshly made by the owner herself :D Very delicious.

Left her a nice tip and a thank you note :) Really appreciate what she did. I'm definitely coming back... no questions asked! Highly recommended but ofc, please don't be like us and come at closing time lol."}
{"text":"Not exactly 4 stars, 3.5 to be exact but definitely a nice place to visit. Apparently their must try was their sweet potato pizza. Unless you're a super big eater or eating to train, then I suggest for you to share this. Its nicely presented on a metal rack and then on a colourful plate (ig moment there). It comes pretty warm so dont leave it there for too long. Its basically toast cubes baked with tomato sauce, cheese, corn, peas and sweet potato cubes in a small casserole dish. Its worth a try if you come here. Makes for a pretty nice lunch too.

Their teas are also very fragrant. I would suggest the coconut cacao pu erh. You also get to refill unlimited times for all the laptop buds out there. Their belgian waffles I could pass... way smaller than I expected (and what their pics showed). Not worth the price in my opinion. Their orange caramel dessert crepe is worth a try (or two) though. Simple, but so flavourful. 

Good place for some quiet time or casual hang out with friends. Decor is also pretty interesting; definitely a lesser known place in the area."}
{"text":"Visited this lovely cafe on a Tuesday evening with my friend. 

Food: Together we shared a red bean patbingsu and a lychee peach tea. It's good to share a dessert with someone since you can split the cost lol and no way I could have finished it myself, especially after having dinner just awhile ago. Overall, the ice cream was really yummy; it's a good summer special as it's the perfect treat on a humid day. The tea however, I didn't feel that it was anything out of the ordinary especially for $3.50~ for a small cup. (Nts: don't drink something hot while having a cold dessert. Your tummy wont appreciate it. :s )

Service: When we arrived, there was only one other customer and some staff members were taking a break so yey not busy and quiet time lol. We were greeted by a friendly korean staff (if you didn't know already, but this place is located in North York = Koreatown). Food arrived quickly and service is good. (:

Decor: From all the cafes I've been to, Orange Caramel has the nicest interior decoration. It's clean, and the overall look is very warm, modern, happy, and comforting. Even their teapots and cups are stylish lol. 

Love how this cafe is located right outside Finch station; SO convenient! Will visit again for sureee!"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I go to Yonge and Finch!
This is probably one of my favourite cafés of all time! I love the calm atmosphere here and the couches too~ The perfect place to chill or work with friends~
It's also conveniently located right across the street from Finch Station, but the door is quite small so you could easily walk past it without noticing.

They also make the best belgian waffles that are just to die for :') I also tried their sweet potato pizza which is basically cubed pieces of toast baked with tomato sauce, cheese, and sweet potatoes!! It was super yummy but also super filling so eat with your friends! They also offer a lot of teas that you brew yourself. You get this adorable little teapot and timer and you can adjust how rich you want your tea to be~

Service is great too because the girl is always friendly and efficient, nothing bad to say about that~

This is the perfect place to relax and indulge in waffles so make sure you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"A cafe that's good for lingering for hours if you only stick to the tea. The place itself is slightly hard to find because it's located on the second floor. Visited on a Saturday afternoon in a group of 4 and could easily score the spot by the window. It had a homey, living room feel - the furniture was a bit rough around the edges, but we liked the plush couches. The staff were nice but incredibly difficult to track down, and service was pretty slow. Green Tea Pancakes and a Hazelnut Latte were both visually pleasing but bland in the taste department. 

The best value is in their decent selection of loose leaf teas which are ~$4. I got the Yerba Mate which came in an interesting brewing device and a sand timer. The price included 4 refills as well! Overall a quiet, comfy spot to chill with friends for cheap if food and fast service aren't priorities."}
{"text":"4.5* 

Following a friend up the narrow stairwell leading to the O-C Tea Cafe, I was quite sure I'd have the dibs on the FTR! I'm happy, though not at all surprised, to find that some fellow Yelpers have already discovered this little oasis in the most unlikely of places. 

If you grew up somewhere in North York, you would know that the Finch/Yonge intersection does not exactly represent inspired establishments, and you would often find yourself driving to adjacent towns (ie Markham/Thornhill/Kris' hoods!) in search of a half decent hangout. Enter Orange Caramel; whereas scoring a stained but comfy chair would be like winning the lottery at your local chain coffee shop, O-C (at least for now) offers an entire room of comfy chairs, couches, and loft seats of all designs! The laid back feel and decor makes me think of what a hip Korean tea house in Miami would look like!

The menu is rather concentrated, which is not a bad alternative to the fifty page menus one would normally come across in a similar establishment. The use of an hourglass for steeping your own tea is an excellent idea that should really be implemented more often. I also noticed a few board games lying around, though I'm not sure how safe it is to play Jenga with a hot beverage in hand. 

There is a bit of room for improvement. I'd love to see a few more specialty tea choices like lapsong or sencha added to the menu, and my ginger tea could have used a bit more ginger! 

Overall, O-C is definitely my current favourite tea house north of Bloor and maybe even in the city."}
{"text":"I was wondering how this place compares to the similar Korean cafes around the neighbourhood. The decor is a jumble of stuffed animals and plants and what not, that do not match. The place is very tiny, yet you feel extremely cozy on the couches. If you plan to do work and need internet, the free wifi is the real asset in this place. There are also solid tables and proper chairs, so you don't get too comfy studying or working on a project. The flavoured teas and dark Italian coffee is gourmet quality and won't disappoint. The food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Read many great reviews on Yelp about this place before coming here yesterday and I was pleased. Before my friends and I left this place, we have concluded that this will be our new study spot!

It's a small cafe with about 8 tables accompanied by couches and teddy bears. A very cozy and bright environment. They also have outlets for your laptops/electronic devices. My friends and I found it quite warm in the cafe... it's probably because they cranked up a notch too high on the heater. But it's alright, it just makes it feel like home on a cold winter day. 

My friend and I shared the Orange Caramel Crepe ($7.99). It's wrapped with strawberries and bananas with a hint of cinnamon powder topped off with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Instead of bananas (due to my allergies), they accommodated me with pineapples. Servers were really friendly and attentive. 

They do not only serve desserts, they serve light snacks as well. Such as sandwiches and pastas. Prices are fair for a dessert place. I would say it's comparable to Demetres.

Nonetheless, I will definitely re-visit to try out their beverages and other desserts!!"}
{"text":"Talking about Hidden... Everyone talks about Cafe Princess being the ultimate place to bring your princess there and no one knows about Orange Caramel Tea Cafe. 

As the name implies Orange Caramel Tea Cafe specializes in Tea... especially loose leaf tea from $3.65. The menu is divided by the different type of tea: Black, Green, Oolong, Dessert, Herbal... And there are tea lattes available too : Sweet Potato latte or something more normal Green Tea Latte.

I love the sofas... the armchairs... and this place is quiet... maybe because it is around 3:30 on a weekday afternoon? But it is a perfect time for tea!!

Pinhead Gunpowder ($3.75) is served in a tray with a tea infusion and a set of 3 timers so one can adjust to how exactly you like your tea to be.

I can stay here for a long time.... just sipping my tea.... and using their Wifi!

BTW, this little cafe does have that \"love\" and \"tacky\" vibe...  When I saw \" I want to say I love you for eternity\" on the wall right behind me!"}
{"text":"This is another one of many cute little cafes in the North York area. It's small, but has comfortable seating - my group of 5 got a spot on the couches in the middle and it was a nice place to relax on a Sunday afternoon. They have a pretty decent selection of food and drinks which are moderately priced. I got a latte called Job's Tears because it sounded interesting and mysterious. It's like a rice tea with a bit of a salty undertone (I suppose because of the tears... lol) Anyway, it was alright, but I wouldn't get it again for $6+. I also tried a bit of the sweet potato pizza, which wasn't as exciting as I expected - it had some sweet potato puree kind of buried under the pizza dough, but because the flavour of the tomato sauce on the pizza was so strong, you couldn't really taste the sweet potato, only a slight hint of sweetness.

This is a nice place to chill and/or study, and a nice alternative to Starbucks because they do have free wi-fi. I think they also have cards you can borrow and maybe a few board games."}
{"text":"The ambiance is warm and cozy, and the loose-leaf tea is excellent - very fragrant - but the waffle and crepe dishes are so-so. There's nothing wrong with the waffles and crepes themselves, and the plating is pretty, but the ice cream they use tastes really cheap (the vanilla is particularly bad). I go here only because the location is convenient."}
{"text":"I came to this little cafe based on the good reviews that it has received. It definitely is very cozy and the staff is very friendly. I went on Halloween and they gave me candy, haha. There are many comfy sofas to sit on and the wall decorations are absolutely adorable.
I ordered a tea and sat for a good hour relaxing with friends. It would also make a good place to study. 
I'll definitely visit this place again in the future!"}
{"text":"We ordered some tea, coffee, a cupcake and a cookie. The cupcake and cookie were both good but pretty ordinary. My girlfriend had the tea and I didn't try any but it looked good. They give you a nice little sand timer and tea infusion device thing that looks pretty awesome. The coffee was a major letdown though.I got the dark italian roast and it tasted like watered down McDonald's. I do like that they have a lot of seats for groups and for two as well. Lots of couches too and atmosphere is quiet and hipsterish."}
{"text":"This cafe is very cozy. I came here once with a friend to study, and it's now my new favorite. The pasta and desserts are amazing, made entirely by the owner/chef. She even delivers the food to you (sometimes). It's a great place to catch up with friends. The service may take long sometimes since there is only one chef who makes everything. When the service takes longer than usual or if you order a bunch from the menu, they give you free vanilla ice cream with espresso (surprisingly good mix of sweet & bitterness)."}
