{"text":"I wanted Chinese food for dinner and had liked the food from their old location so I thought I'd give their new location a try for take out. Big disappointment!  I ordered Sweet and Sour Shrimp and discovered much to my dismay that they had served me uncleaned shrimp!  I don't want shrimp excrement in my food!  Blech!  I had to throw it out as I just can't clean crap out of something and then eat it. So, I paid $11 for inedible shrimp. What a waste..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Our favorite for take out and dine in.  We drive from Westlake/Bay Village area just for takeout.  Inside is very clean and staff are very friendly.  Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I got sweet and sour chicken which is the staple dish to many Chinese restaurants. Let me first start of by saying the lady answering the phone was very rude. I wanted to add a eggroll to my bosses meal and she kept saying the meal doesn't come with that which is why i was trying to add onto the meal. My boss got szechaun chicken and said it was way too spicy and could not eat but a couple of bites. He thought I ordered the wrong meal because he had never seen it prepared the way it was. The chicken in my sweet and sour chicken had a foul taste to it and smelled like dirty old socks that have been worn all day. We all had upset stomachs only after a couple of bites. I would have called back to complain but did not want to deal with the rude lady on the phone again which probably would not have done anything about it. I work for a company that orders a lot of takeout because we are always to busy to leave. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Finally found awesome Chinese in North Olmsted! I usually get Wonton soup and chicken & broccoli. Really flavorful and consistently good every time I order. Pick up orders are ready in about 10-15 minutes. 

Good service and friendly staff. Super cheap lunch deals too with a good amount of food!"}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering takeout from here and it did not disappoint.  This is now my favorite Chinese place around the area and an added benefit is the wonderful customer service I've received here!"}
{"text":"Foo sing is an amazing Chinese restaurant. It's very authentic and unlike other Chinese places is clean and you won't get sick. The short ribs are to die for. If you ever been to china.. lived there or from there this a great place to get to get an authentic meal. I've lived in china for two years and this place is the real deal"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at Foo Sing since 2008 at their Great Northern location next to Bestbuy. We always thought they've had the best Hot and Sour soup, along with the entrees we've tried.  The new location is no disappointment. The food is very fresh and vegetables in the dishes are crunchy and colorful. A couple things I've noted at their new location is:  their entrees have increased in price, they charge for refills and the portions have gotten smaller.  I would still go back considering the staff is very friendly and we've never had a bad meal nor have gotten sick.  I highly recommend the hot and sour soup, the pepper steak entr√©e, the vegetable delight and Tso's chicken."}
{"text":"Best Chinese around! The ladies who work there are always lovely and our food is always great."}
{"text":"I got a haircut today at a place by Foo Sing so I thought I would give it a try. I ordered a small chicken fried rice to go. The restaurant was pretty busy inside so I figured I made a good choice. The staff was very friendly as well as I interacted with two employees while ordering and receiving my food. Now to the food; the rice had a lot of undercooked crunchy rice. The peas were hard (very gross), and the chicken was fatty cubed chunks. Maybe they have some other good food but the fried rice was horrible. Very disappointed! And just got to my fortune cookie but there was not fortune in it. Actually had to laugh after writing this review while eating and having that top it off."}
{"text":"The food is good. This is the first Chinese buffet that I have actually liked. The beef and broccoli was so delicious. The beef was so tender. The rice was just right. They even had a small desert selection. It was clean and they were always replenishing things. The price was great. This is my second favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The best Chinese buffet especially cream cheese wonton Chinese donuts!!! 
Good for families and friends gathering and most of all, the price is right!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on the high reviews but was sadly disappointed. The order was prepared very quickly.
I ordered the following in the small or standard size:
Crab rangoon- filling was blah,  no crab flavor. Wrapper was very thick and chewy instead of crispy.
Egg drop soup- bland. Had to add soy sauce and sirracha
Vegetable lo mein- lots of veggies, nice texture to the noodles 
Shrimp lo mein- good amount of shrimp but very bland
Chicken fried rice- absolutely no flavor. The chicken literally tasted like plain cooked chicken breast with no seasoning. The rice did not look like it was fried rice at all
Chicken on stick- pretty good, chicken was tender and flavorful
Vegetable egg roll- good flavor but SO greasy. Oil just dripping out.
Beef and broccoli- the best thing i ordered. Very flavorful, meat was tender, broccoli was crisp
General tso's chicken- tiny pieces of flavorless chicken thickly wrapped in deep fried breading. Not good. 

Overall, i won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a business associate.  $7 all you can eat Americanized Chinese food. A smaller selection of items vs. most similar buffets, but there is enough variety.  Everything was fresh and hot, but predictably there were no stand out items and all the hot/spicy items were very mild.  As another reviewer noted, the food is slightly less greasy compared what you are served an the average Chinese place.  The service was fine, and the environment was ok and seemed clean."}
{"text":"They don't understand vegetarians! 

We went here for take out and left only to find out we got the wrong order (two beef and broccoli instead of one beef and broccoli and one broccoli with garlic sauce). We also got cream cheese wontons and two egg rolls, one egg roll was vegetarian and the lady behind the counter even made sure it wasn't pork and had it remade before we left (yet somehow thought I ordered beef and broccoli?). 

We went back to have them remake it and didn't want cold food so we asked them to remake everything. They refused to remake the first order, and instead of remaking our rolls and wontons it appears they simply refried them. As a result our wontons were basically inedible, and the broccoli garlic sauce was severely undercooked as I'm positive they rushed the cooking of it. 

After an 8 hour day on the road eating barely anything it was NOT a satisfying meal. If they had simply redone our order from scratch it may have at least been edible. I'm extremely disappointed with how they handled a simple mistake."}
{"text":"This place is close by and I was in the mood for Chinese and I didn't want food court Chinese from the mall so I gave this place a try, first and last time! We ordered beef lo mein and Hunan Chicken and spring rolls came with the entrees so we didn't say, \"no\". The beef was either over cooked or has been sitting in the freezer for a few years before it reached my taste buds. The \"Hunan Chicken\" was cooked nicely but there weren't any vegetables and by my second bite I couldn't figure out if we were eating chicken or pork..pushed food aside and gave the spring rolls a shot for the most part they were ok once I lathered the soy sauce and duck sauce on top. I'm not very picky, I just wanted some chicken and fresh crunchy vegetables..Should have stuck with the food court at Great Northern! The atmosphere inside is a typical buffet style Chinese restaurant just slightly smaller. When we picked up our food to go we were greeted by the owner who was really humble and sweet. I do however suggest China King in North Ridgeville much better and I guess will be the only place I order from just didn't feel like driving out 20-25 minutes. You never know until you try it, right? I guess that's what Yelp is for."}
{"text":"Love this place. Restaurant is very clean, staff is nice and food is exceptional.  Sizes are not as large as traditional Chinese take-out but flavor/ quality easily justifies. We have used both take out and dine in all with a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was dry and stale. The fried wontons felt like they were prefried and we're not good... the sauce was nonexistent and I wish I had eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"Clean dining area and attentive service.  The lunch prices are outstanding.  Full entree, soup and an egg roll for under $5.  The food was middle of the road Chinese cuisine.  You won't be disappointed but you likely won't travel out of your way to come back.  If you're in the mood for Chinese and you're in the neighborhood this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"So Foo Sing closed about three years ago, and we have been waiting at least since November for the re-opening in the new location in the plaza across from Walmart.  Today was opening day and normally I do not look for a lot on the first day a business is open.  I am very pleased to report that Foo Sing is back and the food is  better than before.  

Foo Sing was a typical carry out Chinese restaurant, that tried to increase business by being the third restaurant in the Great Northern Plaza to offer a buffet.  The food was OK but nothing to write home about.

The new location has new furniture, and obviously a new cook.  The food is fresh and very good.  I had the hot and sour soup, which was spiced just right.  The egg rolls are served with fresh mustard, and the kung pao chicken is made with fresh vegitables and excellent spiced chicken.  The sauce is not a traditional brown sauce 
in that it features sweet and ginger notes.  I thought it was a nice creative tack.

My wife had the shrimp lo-mein, with the thin noodles.  It had excellent flavor.

Lunch for two was about $15.00 for everything, which is a great value for the quality of the food, service and restaurant.  Welcome back Foo Sing.  New, fresh and better than ever."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Their garlic chicken is the perfect amount of heat (not too hot) and flavor. Only complaint is they have to ease up on the onions!  I swear they put an entire onion in every order. Now I order without onion and it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Order chicken and broccoli tonight. First time trying this dish from here. The portion size was very hearty and there was a bowl of rice next to the plate. The flavors were really good and I have left overs for lunch tomorrow. Will order chicken and broccoli again for sure"}
{"text":"SO SO SO GLAD to learn that Foo Sing has re-opened in a new space. The new location is absolutely beautiful. My husband and I frequented Foo Sing as a dating couple, decades ago, and loved that place. Awesome lunch buffet, and much better than the typical Chinese fast food/take out. It's just several notches above the norm in every respect, in my opinion. Love the Singapore Chow Fun, and hub drools every time he thinks about the Mongolian Beef. My 8 year old daughter ordered the egg drop soup (she's becoming a connoisseur of egg drop soup from different Chinese restaurants), and she said it was the best she had ever eaten.  We can't wait until the sushi bar is open - what a fun new thing that will be to try out! The Murdocks will be frequenting, frequently!"}
{"text":"I am a first-timer! I'm a 6 foot, 220 pound guy, so, I tried the lunch buffet. I ate almost everything on the buffet and it was the best I ever had! From the green beans to the hot and sour soup to the numerous type of noodles was the best ever! Thanks to the owner Vicki for her hospitality!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. First time was great, but the second time it was not good. The first time the buffet was full of fresh food and the second time it was old looking and most of the containers were empty. I had to ask for more chicken with broccoli and they brought out a very tiny amount.  After my husband got his, which wasn't much, there was none left for me. I didn't want ask them to bring out more of everything, but they really should have had more food out. But really, for a $6.50 buffet it's pretty decent.  Especially when they actually have food out!  I will go back... with hopes for a fuller buffet."}
{"text":"Foo Sing moved from their old location at Great Northern, to a new spot a quarter mile to the East, 25102 Brookpark Road, in the plaza front of the Target.
I've only been here for lunch, but I like the spot.  They have a buffet, which they refresh pretty regularly.  Better food, but not as much selection, as the larger buffet at Great Northern. It's the usual Chinese buffet fare, Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso, Egg Foo Yung, Sweet and Sour and Wonton soups, and so forth.  Plus do it yourself self-serve ice cream for desert.  
Nice place for lunch (can't say about dinner)."}
{"text":"Couldn't be more disappointed with my order.
  Sweet and sour chicken 
Rice had a burnt taste to it and The sauce was half filled in container and didn't taste like any sweet and sour I've ever tasted before."}
{"text":"Always good. I first came here in 1997 for their lunch specials. I learned what Sesame Chicken and General Tso Chicken was from here. I've since moved away and have always judged every other Chinese place by Foo Sing and it never matches up. 

I am currently visiting in town and planned my day around being there and hungry by noon. Today's visit checked every box on my list. 

First, the price for the lunch special has not changed in 20 years. $6.25 gets you the same entree, egg roll and soup or soda it did in 1997. I wanted to congratulate them on this achievement. 

Next, as many chain restaurants will change their menu and your favorites will disappear or as money gets tight and new suppliers have better prices to offer nothing appears to have changed. They measured up to the very taste that I have been measuring every other place against. 

I usually enjoy trying many different things on a restaurant's menu but as this will be my only meal here until I make the cross country journey again I will have to say that I can't speak for every item on the menu and possibly you have your own \"Foo Sing\" that you measure all others against but for me this place remains on the top. With possibly the second place going to House of Nan King in Chinatown San Francisco, so there you go."}
{"text":"Delicious chinese food. Some of the best I have had. Their new location is super clean and nice inside. The staff is friendly and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Meh, it's ok. I got general tso tofu to go. I was hoping for more but it's basically lightly flavored GT sauce in soup form. It's very runny, lots of liquid in the sauce. I'd like it more condensed. 

The restaurant has a takeout area, and dining in looks pleasant. Just can't really recommend the GT tofu. Way to runny. 

Service was great though."}
{"text":"Food is good compared to other options in this area. Unfortunately the delivery option is inconsistent.  Occasionally they don't have a driver."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat for lunch buffet around North Olmsted. The ladies here super nice and the food is always hot and good. I like the variety of food that they put out on the buffet too. Remind me of just like a mom-and-pop kind of a place I like it."}
{"text":"When I need Chinese carry out in my area this is my go to place. Fresh fast and good quality. Go to items: Pork Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Chinese restaurant around. Wonderful service, great food! The general tso's chicken was amazing. The deal they have for two people for $25 is a great deal, I havent seen that from any other Chinese restaurants around here. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Having read all the review, I guess I expected more or at least to be wowed. I have nothing negative but wasn't impressed like the other who reviewed. I suspect it could have been several factors (too early in the day, there was no one else there). I may try it again if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"If not for an insulting employee at a Chinese restaurant in Rocky River across from Westgate, we might never have discovered Foo Sing.  

Being a big fan of Asian foods, I have to say that the dishes we had here at Foo Sing were quite good for the very affordable pricing.  Since I prepare some favorite ones myself, I could immediately tell from appearance and taste that all ingredients were especially fresh---as if Foo Sing didn't begin preparing our order until it was given.   (Likely not, since all of these take time---certainly much longer than 15 minutes from start to finished dish.) 

CHICKEN CHOW MEIN
Tasted as good as it looked.  Although shorter slices would be easier to eat, the bright orange carrots and vivid green celery certainly enhanced the visual.  While other places are content serving pale, dull-looking versions of this dish, Foo Sing succeeds in colorful, enticing presentation.  With a perfect balance of both crunchy and tender vegetables, the moist chicken had been carefully prepped and trimmed, with no discernible fat or gristle.  Or bone.  (Yes, bone.  It's because of those sloppy results elsewhere, that I began preparing Asian dishes myself years ago.  But I appreciate having a quick take-out once in a while to save time.)  Somewhat on the mild side for my taste, it was still enjoyable and should please the majority of non-Asian diners.  Too spare an amount of crispy noodles, though.  One especially small bag.  I'll ask for extra next time. And it might have been just this particular batch, but more thickening agent would have improved it, since a bit too watery.

ROAST PORK FRIED RICE
Very nicely flavored.  Especially liked that no chunks of unappetizing unrendered pork fat or chewy gristle were mixed in.  With some other places, I've had to sweep through the rice to remove them.  The very few small fat cubes present were cooked through---browned and edible.  An obviously carefully-prepped and assembled result, with a generous amount of pork meat, diced carrots, and peas.  

VEGETABLE EGG FOO YUNG
Perfectly prepared.  Another tasty dish that kitchen staff had clearly taken time and thought in preparation.  Mildly-flavored patties with a mildly-seasoned brown sauce. 

EGG ROLLS
Decent enough.  Not the best, but better than most other places we've tried.  An acceptable 3 stars.

We'd order the Chow Mein, Fried Rice, and Foo Yung again, and would try other ones, too.  If Foo Sing can succeed with these likely most popular, frequently-ordered, less-complicated dishes, chances are they'll do a nice enough job with ones having more ingredients or requiring more steps.  Among the few of the freshest-tasting Asian dishes we've ever had---and all still flavorful after reheating leftovers 2 days later.

I'm indebted to Princess Bloatus Blossom.  Because of her, we've found a new go-to. My phone order went like this:  

Friendly, cordial...
\"Hi.  I'd like to place an order for pickup?  I'd like two 
egg rolls...one vegetable and one chicken...one 
pork fri---\"

Sighing, curtly interrupting:  
\"hmmhh...next time, just say one vegetable egg 
roll and one chicken egg roll.\" 

Huh? Excuse me? Did I just hear that right?  Me dumb.  Where have I been?  Obviously, I missed the news flashes about the latest wording protocol when ordering takeout from restaurant employees who have grandiose opinions of themselves.   I gave her the rest of our $40+ order, and hung up.  Seconds later I pressed the re-dial and without raising my voice or saying anything insulting, I told her to cancel---that I didn't want to order anything from anyone as rude as she was.  Astonishingly, she lamely, ignorantly, actually began arguing, trying to defend herself, implying I wasn't clear.  Had she apologized, I might not have cancelled.  Hung up on the airhead, and called Foo Sing.

In business for decades, that Rocky River spot is now permanently scratched off my list of Chinese dining choices.  Not only because of their increasingly disappointing dishes (consistently 4.5-5 stars up until about a dozen years ago) but also their female employees' \"I am superior to you\" attitudes.  Oblivious about the fundamentals of polite phone etiquette---unlike their amiable male counterparts---their heads have become way too big for their embroidered cheongsams.

Now friendly Vickie at Foo Sing?  And other staff at the Foo?  All well beyond Manners 101.  Smiling, helpful, courteous.  The Foo---across from Walmart, on Brookpark---deserves a much bigger slice of that enlarging West Side Asian Stir Fry pie, and more favorable reviews.  No absurdly inflated prices here, either.  Check them out.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did---and I'm admittedly super-particular about ingredients, how they're prepared, and the final results.  Especially Asian.
