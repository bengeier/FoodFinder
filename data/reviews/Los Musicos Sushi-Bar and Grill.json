{"text":"Wanted some guacamole so I thought Mexican.  This place had Mexican Sushi -- what a thought so I decided to try.  Now I am a fan of Japanese food and I like the subtleness.  I had the idea that Mexican Sushi would be flavorful and Mexican flavors in a roll.  Not quite what I expected.  The flavors were just too subtle for my taste and while I had the eel sauce and chipotle sauce along with some teriyaki -- it just didn't hit me.  The chop sticks were a nice touch in a Mexican restaurant as they were advertising tacos and burritos along with the sushi.  However, I expected the food to have a Mexican taste or even some taste at all and the sushi  was just sushi and I've had better sushi at a traditional Japanese.  Maybe someone else will like it, however, it was just far too bland for my taste, I can't see returning."}
{"text":"My wife really wanted to try this new restaurant that was Mexican sushi.  
We ordered an Arizona roll and a number 10.  It took some time to prepare our orders.  The rolls are large and my wife and I could have shared just one.
The Arizona roll was slightly sweet.  The number 10, was awesome!
It has a little bit of spice and savory flavor that my wife and I loved.
We came back on a double date.  We got an assortment of rolls, the best was number 10 the Musicos roll.
For our third trip we took our daughter and the Grandparents.  Grandma avoids anything spicy so she enjoyed a quesadilla, but Grandpa really liked the number 10.
We have cravings for it."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I first heard about this place. I love sushi and I love Mexican so Mexican sushi sounds awesome! After a visit here I still say it's a cool concept but this place failed in its execution.

Boyfriend and I went here on a Monday night. We were the only people there. I think in the time we were there one other couple came in and had a drink but no one else got food. I think this place is doomed.

The menu is confusing. All the rolls seem pretty much the same except some are cooked. But they all had seafood and some meat or a combination of both, the way the descriptions were written made it hard to tell. And they all had cream cheese, which was weird.

We ordered two rolls - one cooked, one not - and the cooked one had some kind of meat. Each roll was around $10 but they're big so 1 roll could be an entr√©e I guess. The cooked roll was the better of the two. I think the meat and the fried stuff on the outside added flavor that was lacking in the uncooked roll. They both came with a pepper (I guess that's the Mexican part?) and some kind of dipping sauce that was not soy sauce. They also had teriyaki and chipotle sauces on the table. We also got a quesadilla, which was actually the best thing we ate.

Overall the rolls were forgettable and kinda bland. The imitation crab tasted cheap. And I'm still not sure where the Mexican part was other than the pepper and the option of chipotle sauce. I guess I was expecting a taco roll or a carne asada roll, something more creative. 

This place has the idea, but they need to work on making it come to life better."}
