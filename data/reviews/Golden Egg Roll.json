{"text":"My order wasn't taken accurately. I ordered Seasame chicken steamed rice which came with lettuce that didn't look fresh. Chicken was normal. Actually the egg roll & the \"Wonton\" chip smelled weird ( it could've been the quality of the oil used).  The restrooms weren't kept clean enough. They were one of the worst kept restrooms.  The TV connection had its glithces too. I couldn't enjoy one of the important Soccer matches."}
{"text":"Been this restaurant couple times,fast service,foods are great,highly recommended Chinese food."}
{"text":"This joint has been a staple in my circle of friends and coworkers for years. Dine in, takeout and delivery. I have done it all. In the 10+ years I have been coming here, I have rarely had an issue. And if I did, they were always quick to correct whatever mistake was made. The staff is generally courteous and easy to deal with. The whole place is very laid back and I like that.   I'm a big fan of their appetizers menu. The egg rolls, pot stickers and beef skewers are all fantastic and sometimes I pop in just for that.   Their Lo Mein noodles are also good and they never take issue when I order my Chicken Lo Mein with no veggies. Sometimes all a man needs is some chicken and noodles and they do it up proper.   They also have killer fried rice. It's really good. It's the first item I tried when I started coming here and have been hooked ever since.   A dish I really dig from this place is the Mongolian Chicken. The chicken is always tender, combined with onions, garlic and green onions over a bed of noodles. I order it pretty much every time I go.   This is not a gourmet restaurant. This is Chinese fast food done the right way. Fast, cheap and good. It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town, been eating here since 2006! Mongolian beef is my fav! But then again everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Golden Egg Roll is my favorite Chinese food place (and it is conveniently located down the street from my office, making it a frequent lunch choice). I've been going there for years now and their fried rice cannot be beat for me. Their crab puffs are excellent as is their sweet and sour chicken. I'm not overly fond of the salad (though my friends like it) or their egg rolls so I don't typically get those with my meal."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat! Fast friendly and fresh cooked the food is not over cooked and dry. Hard to find these days! Only wish there was one near our house!"}
{"text":"Ugh, I wish I could give this 5 stars. The food was good. And the people were nice. The guy gave a good recommendation."}
{"text":"the food is great here and the service is amazing!! I recommond everyone to go and give it a try! I personally like the mongolian beef, and the price is really reasonable compare to other chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. I got the orange chicken extra spicy and it was so bland. No flavor at all. The fried rice wasnt good either. Nothing was in it is it looked and tasted like brown rice.   The only reason I gave it two stars and not one is because the egg roll was good- but it's hard to screw up an egg roll as long as its warm.   I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Found this great place near my house! The dinning area is a little small but the food makes up for it! The staff was very friendly and pricing was not bad at all for the portions we were given. My husband and I both got a combo plate and each a small drink and it was only about $22. But they do have they same combos avialable for lunch special pricing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is something to be said for the exceptionally friendly staff at this place. The eggrolls and shrimp lo-mein are good, not great. The sesame chicken is flavorful, but a bit on the dry side. It's not something that you're going to go out of your way for.... I think they used to be a lot better a few years ago. Just be sure to have the appropriate expectations if you make your way in here."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese fast food. No MSG, fresh vegetables in unique dishes like the beef and broccoli, chicken and vegetables, and vegetable lo mein. The noodles taste authentic, not too salty, but flavorful. Definitely try this place! Delivery is between 30-45 minutes as they say, and the prices are very low."}
{"text":"My mom always went here when she was in the office across the street. Whenever my family had been in the area, she would treat us here. I was so lucky when my boyfriend moved into the neighborhood nearby so that we could always go here! He has since moved, but the 15 minute drive is worth it. The orange chicken sauce is so good, I always order a little extra just to mix my rice in with it. You can never go wrong with a good orange chicken meal. I have yet to try anything different here, why ruin a good thing, right? The service is also very good. They're friendly, quick, and easy to talk to. The place is kept very clean always. The bathrooms have never been dirty when I'm in and the tables are wiped down regularly. I always call ahead when driving in just because it does take a while to make the food, but I'd rather know it's freshly made than pulled out of a pan that only God knows how long it has been sitting out for (I'm looking at you, Panda Express). Such a homey place with terrific food! Love it here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy golden egg rolls food but every time I order it's so small I pay extra and get the regular size they do this every time so finally I'm done. When you call they argue with you tell you you're wrong and refused to refund your order. Robbery. They will never get another Penny out of me."}
{"text":"Ive been here over a few years, its one place where u get great food n excellent (cheerful) Customer service.  It had a remodel done few years ago, new paint n decor... food n service hasnt changed... If anyone knows is lookin for gud Chinese food, come here!"}
{"text":"I continue to give Golden Egg Roll 4 stars.  I love the house chicken and schezwan chicken (I'm sure I misspelled that).  I did not like the Hunan chicken; however, I despise bell peppers and didn't realize they were in this meal until after I got it.  Golden Egg Roll became a regular place for me to go to because it was cheap and better than decent.  Now that I've moved, I'm going to miss this place."}
{"text":"Not so great, I feel their food taste and quality of meat is not up to the mark. Most of the time the chicken is like old and fried long hours back so it used be very dry and hard. And fried rice was very oily and with frozen veggies :(. Egg rolls were like once I get from frozen packs."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service is warm and welcoming I would recommend this place to anyone that loves Chinese food"}
{"text":"Ordered some vegetable chow mein. Wanted it spicy and it had no kick at all. Lost two stars for that. Spring rolls were good though, hot and good flavor. Overall, wouldn't try this place again except for some rolls."}
{"text":"Good food at a great prices. Our complete order for dinner was approx $30. Would absolutely eat there again"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the hood! Quick delivery. Reasonable prices. Fried rice is wonderful. Portion is enuf for 2. Shrimp in lobster sauce is great and shrimp aren't chew, are just right. Friendly helpful service. Busy all the time. Wait could be shorter but that's because they cook to order. I'm a repeat customer. See going back again."}
{"text":"I've tried Golden Egg Roll twice. Once for delivery and once in the restaurant. BLECH! Both times. Actually ICK the first time, MEH slash ICK the second time. The delivery is quick and efficient. I ordered the House Fried Rice and a veggie egg fu young. I was grossed out by the shrimp in the fried rice. I could SMELL my shrimp before it even entered my mouth. Sounds normal right? No it was FUNKY shrimp that was slightly slimy. Blech. My Fu Young was unremarkable after you got past the saltiness of the dish.  Months later, I was asked by a coworker to have lunch. I let her pick the place... I will never make that mistake again. She picked Golden Egg Roll. The restaurant itself is nice and clean from what I saw. I chose the orange chicken. Again with the salt! I was baffled and I asked the other ladies I was with if they were having the same issue. Yes, they were! Well that summed it up for me.  I probably won't visit Golden Egg Roll again. What a bummer, they have all this swag from a service (they probably paid for) naming them one of the top Chinese restaurants in the area. I'm uninterested in giving this joint another shot, unfortunately. There are too many other places to try."}
{"text":"I came into golden egg roll after riding my bike and had a great tofu chow mien bowl. The service was great and everything was affordably priced. This place is close to REI and it was nice to go check out the store after. I would say that the inside was clean but old. Plenty of seating. Seemed more of a take out kind of place though. I would definitely go back again. Would be nice to have a few more vegetarian options though :)"}
{"text":"This is your typical hole in the wall Chinese food place, and it's exactly what you would expect menu wise but over the 5 or so years I've been going there the food has been consistently good. Its a once a month staple for lunch with my coworkers."}
{"text":"Still my favorite...I have moved from Tempe, and I miss this place weekly. Got to go back this weekend and have my 2 favorites - shrimp fried rice and lemon chicken. Even tried some new stuff- walnut shrimp and chicken fried rice and they were both deelish! I recommend take out because the place is cramped and can get loud. The prices are great and the food is even better. And the staff is so friendly and remember their regulars no matter how long it has been."}
{"text":"Food is okay and occasionally can sometimes lack flavor. I had an experience where I ordered near lunch time with some co workers I was given about a 45 min estimate to when it would arrive. An hour later I still had no food and called since I was coming to an end on my lunch time. The owner said the driver was down he road and since the eggroll is only ten minutes away from me I waited. I finally received my order close to two hours later it was under cooked and the driver told me he was getting gas. The food was cold and our drinks were flat. On his way out the driver was pushing for a tip when I denied him for being late he threw my bag at me and honked his car flipping me off on his way out. I won't be going here again although I did love it in the past."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken! The chicken was nice and crispy with a orange like glaze. A whole lot better! Than that soggy chicken you'd get anywhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered my food at 7:45, than I got a call at 8:16 asking me where my apartment was.  After explaining to him multiple times over the next 25 minutes my food finally arrived.  I love golden eggroll and I wish that I didn't have to write a bad review about them, but how they handled it was inappropriate.  Once I got my food it was obviously cold.  I called right away to speak with the manager.  She told me that people get lost and it wasn't her fault and that if I want a refund I have to bring the food back to her.  I told her that someone could come and pick it up, but she refused and then she hung up on me.  I've ordered from them 20 times at least, but I will not continue to."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great delivery range and pretty affordable, and for how good the food is; forget about it! This is the first place I recommend when it comes to Chinese food."}
{"text":"Flew in on a business trip and asked the front desk for a recommendation on a Chinese delivery joint. Called Golden Eggroll, one of the best take out places I've been to. Had the twice cooked pork ( I always get it to compare), savory, rich and spicy. Loaded with veggies and nice helping of \"fried rice\". The rice was just plain and not your typical loaded fried rice but paired well with the pork. Biggish portion and came with an eggroll and some fried wontons for 8 bucks. Highly recommended !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got food poisoning from here a couple years ago. I called to let them know and they did not even care. They just said we have not had anyone else tell us. I will never eat here again. Because of them I have not order Chinese food from anywhere since it happened. I have never been that sick in my life."}
{"text":"Fabulous food every time! Not to mention they deliver..."}
{"text":"Love this place- the food is excellent. The delivery service is definitely spotty... But I live close enough that I drive over for pick up. Otherwise it takes about 2 hours for delivery. I still eat here at least 2 times a month. Lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, Sesame Chicken, all favourites. If you want quality taste, and don't mind eating in the hole in the wall dining room or running to pick it up, you will not be disappointed. ;)"}
{"text":"ok so I work next door at the bead store, we've all had our share of encounters with this horrible place. A couple of times we've gotten bugs in our food... not fun! We have rats coming thru our walls from their place... and we always see them sharpening their tools outside on the cement. Not to mention, the owner is a complete bitch! She is rude and i would NEVER NEVER recommend this place to anyone. We have customers coming in all the time complaining about this place or asking us how their food is, and as soon as we tell them the horrors, they thank us, and we reccomend them to a nicer better place."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for a potluck at work. Great food for the price..i had the sweet and sour shrimp combo with egg fried rice and eggroll..mine was excellent"}
{"text":"It's a $6 lunch special Chinese restaurant. Nothing too special, but nothing glaringly offensive either. House chicken special get you a thin pounded chicken breast breaded and fried, covered in a sticky dark sauce, and served sliced with a ginger dressed salad, fried wonton square, and an eggroll. It's quick, painless, and expected."}
{"text":"Start your review...The price was right on and the quantity was fat! The food was tasty! Seems the husband and daughter have been going here for a while and they love it too!"}
{"text":"Typical strip mall chinese mom and pop restaurant.  Nothing too spectacular.   Greatest point was for the very attentive lady who saw to our order and comfort.  Nice home feel.  Food was average, if not a bit salty.  But the price and quantitiy was appreciated.  We were in the area and it met our needs nicely.  Not a place to drive out of the way for."}
{"text":"This is not Egg Foo Young! I always order egg foo young from any Chinese restaurant I visit. I have never receive my dish with all the vegetables and meat on the outside of the patty. The egg patty was thick and spunge like, not thin and light and flavorful at all. I was very disappointed with this dish. Basically ended up with a rice bowl."}
{"text":"No stars. I was very disappointed when items were left off my order. Will not be ordering again unable to enjoy my meal. $30 down the drain ZERO STARRRRRRS"}
{"text":"I love anything I get there whether it's chicken, shrimp or beef and I LOVE their sweet and sour sauce, it's not as heavy as most. The reason I rate it 3 stars is because of the rice! I wish it was more fried rice-y? It's fully cooked and all I just want more flavor. And I just hate water chestnuts and forget they put it in like all of their sides and that's it.  The food is good, just season your rice."}
{"text":"I've been going to Golden Eggroll for 18 years now and I've got to say.  I love the Kung Pao Chicken.  Still taste as good as it was then when I first went there.  Another favorite of mine is the Hot and Sour Soup, always cure a bad cold.  I recently introduce my neighbor to the place and he can't stop talking about the Orange Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice.  Now its on my to try list."}
{"text":"Food is a great value, no complaints in that department. I like the orange chicken a lot, it tastes like something you'd pay a lot more for in a sit down restaurant.  Online ordering is apparently a gamble. Today I ordered, received a confirmation email and 90 minutes later hadn't received my food. Gave them a call and they claim they didn't get the order. They said I could wait another hour if I still wanted food. Kind of a let down. :(  I'll probably be less ticked off in time and they really do have great food, but a bad customer service experience just stings a little."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the east valley. Food is fast, fresh, and always delicious. Whenever I want Chinese food, that's my \"go to\" place. I love the house chicken, Szechuan chicken, and pork fried rice. You basically CAN'T go wrong with any dish they have here. Plus, they deliver! If only we lived in their delivery range. This is all coming from a first generation Chinese American whose family is quite particular about food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is great, prices are very reasonable and the service is fast. They have mobile ordering and delivery advertised as well. BBQ pork fried rice for the win!"}
{"text":"Ordered my favorite dish (sesame chicken lunch combo) and I was very disappointed. Chicken was smothered in some syrup like sauce. Fried rice was ok nothing special and the egg roll wasn't the greatest. I've had way too much great chinese food to go back to this place. You get what you pay for I guess."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. Their rice and sweet and sour chicken is very good. Their house chicken is awesome. They also have delivery which is very fast compared to pizza joints."}
{"text":"I love this they are super good and freaky fast almost like Jimmy john's but Chinese.  I always order here and they always get my food to me right away. The orange chicken is pure awesomeness!"}
{"text":"General Tsos chicken is literally a little chicken with a huge puff of batter surrounding it"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three different times, all were takeout. Never had a problem with food quality or quickness. It's your basic Americanized Chinese takeout place. And the food's decent."}
{"text":"Two words, HOUSE CHICKEN. The gentleman at the counter is nothing but polite, and willing to bring me a side of chili paste for my fried rice. A small order of the chicken and a small order of fried rice feeds two, and I'm a big dude. Value, and quality. My two favorite things, for the moment."}
{"text":"i'm not even sure where to begin. this was my first time ordering. i thought i would try to see what else was good in the neighborhood. i will not order from them again. the people were very nice and the delivery was fast, food was hot BUT, i ordered chicken foo young. it came in a soup container which at first i didn't know what it was. foo young  is patties right? this foo young was all crumbled up under too much gravy. it looked like mish-mosh. i also ordered chicken chow mein. chow mein noodles are dark, this looked like either chop suel or mybe lo mein. the noodles are white and there is veggies on top that are not in chow mein. chinese corn, mushroom,the big peas. i was so sure the guy delivered the wrong order but when i called the man said the foo young patrtries where underneath the gravy. like i said earlier no patties just mish-mosh. no chow mein some other kind of mein. the best thing was the free egg roll and the chicken fried rice. i was/am so disappointed plus i wasted my darn money.. i'll give em 2 stars for being nice"}
{"text":"This place is ok. If you're in the mood for generic Chinese take-out, then this is the place for you. Kung pao isn't spicy enough and frankly doesn't have enough chicken. Lunch combos are reasonably priced for the portion served."}
{"text":"I live really close, so I order from them often. Not anymore. The food is good, but I'm getting tired of the piss poor service. Last few times I have ordered they either took a ridiculous amount of time to fill the order and deliver it (I literally live a block away), or they forget one of my items. I just ordered again, and wrote in the notes not to put any ice in my TWO pepsis that I ordered. I wanted to see if they actually read the notes. Well, my husband answers the door while I'm in the other room, and when I come out... sure enough they read the notes. No ice, but they only brought one drink. SO ANNOYING. Make sure you never tip them until they actually bring your food. I'm just going to have to find another place to get chinese food from. Thanks for the disappointment, Golden Egg Roll. That's a good $30-$60 a week you just lost from my orders."}
{"text":"Worst steamed rice I have ever had. Rice smells terrible and has no flavor. It stunk up my car when I got it for take out. Good service but terrible food. Low quality chicken/not enough sauce on chicken. The best thing there were the egg rolls. I give the egg rolls a 4/5."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, this is actually pretty darn good. Nothing fancy on the inside, but that's ok. Priced right and good portions."}
{"text":"Ive ordered from them 1st time Yesterday SOO GoooD Og My God So GOOD Ribs were  Smoking hot :) and  the  chicken, sweet n sour chicken Delicous :) anyone Who bashes this company doesnt Know what their  talking about Im  Really Impressed Of How delicious the food was       WIll definately  Order from them AGAIN :)!!"}
{"text":"An average eatery.  Not a bad choice if you are craving Chinese food on your lunch break and don't have time to go too far.  Other than that, not much to redeem it."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it is close to the office. The food was good and fresh. Not too geasy either. I had sweet and sour pork with fried rice and of course the egg roll. It didn't take long to get my carryout and the staff was very friendly. It is reasonably priced. I will definitely go back. Thanks golden eggroll!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food ever !! Amazon orange chicken and the best crab puffs!! I don't go anywhere else !!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today to get Mongolian Beef.  When I returned to work and opened the box, what was inside was a heaping mound of onions and about 3 pieces of beef.  To top it off, I paid for the dinner portion.  Will never go back.  Posting a picture for management to see how bad this was."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I've been looking for a good Chinese take away in the Tempe area for awhile. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The portions are very large and taste good. Everything is cooked to order. The beef in the beef house fried rice melts in your mouth and I highly recommend the Mongolian chicken. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The food is great but the people working there don't listen to you. I asked for chicken chow mein with rice and they asked me, \"with the crunchy noodles,\" and I say yes. When they deliver it they don't bring the rice and I call to tell them. They tell me that I ordered the large and not the combo that comes with rice when I specifically asked for rice with chicken chow mein calling me a liar. I have bought previously before and they are mostly good at bringing everything but there has been 3 times now and 3 times is too many."}
{"text":"The Golden Egg Roll is my go-to for Chinese food. The sweet and sour sauce is amazing. The crab puffs have just the right amount of stuff and aren't overfull of either cream cheese or crab. I usually get those with chicken dishes. One of my favorites is the teriyaki chicken. The fried rice is also to die for and has just enough flavor.   The only problem for me is the delivery fee, since I usually only order in from them. Still, they're good enough for me to be a repeat customer in spite of the delivery fee. Whenever I need a chinese fix but don't want to or can't go out, the Golden Egg Roll is it."}
{"text":"Today I ate here for a late lunch and a couple of bites into my shrimp and broccoli I tasted ammonia as if the food was spoiled.  I spit it out and complained to the staff. One of the owners said do not come back again. Do not eat here!! If people will tell you do not come back again because they served you spoiled food then they do not deserve the business. They will definitely not get another dime from me."}
{"text":"Food was hot and fresh, just not very flavorful. I had the orange chicken and it was mediocre at best, hardly ANY taste at all and no orange flavor. My wife purchased the chicken chow mein and she said it was terrible. The only good thing was the eggroll, but its kinda hard to screw that up. I would recommend it if you were stuck in that area and had no where else to eat. I live next door and I'll never be going back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Golden Egg roll for years! When my brother used to live out here this was the place we went for lunch.  It is a great lunch spot! I haven't been during dinner time.  I took my daughter there for lunch, it was 12pm on a Thursday, and it wasn't packed, we placed our order, I had the orange chicken combo, extra spicy! Omg so delish!! I love their spicy orange chicken! Cannot get enough! My daughter ordered beef broccoli and she enjoyed it as well!  Yea I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We ordered the mu shu pork & lemon chicken. The mu shu pork was the best though, so flavorful! Don't forget to use the sauce they give you! Def. Coming here again!"}
{"text":"Not bad for the first take out. We ordered sweet and sour and szechuan pork with crab puffs and used a coupon for an egg roll. Not bad for the both of us for at least $20! It tastes authentic and flavorful than the other Chinese restaurants in the area.The place is tiny, but as long as the food is good right? Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've only ever tried their delivery, seeing as my lunch break usually isn't at a convenient time to go try and make a store visit. The meals are decent, but a bit salt packed. Very large portions, but also very pricey. If you want a quick delivery for decent food, call them up. Otherwise, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food can be OK here.  How can so many of the other reviews be such polar opposites...either one star or five stars?  Some of the bad reviews  are scaring me away from this place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friend, had the Beef Mongolian and friend had Mu Shu pork. Both very good, service fast and friendly. Everything fresh. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible high cost and small portion's the people are very in profetiomal and don't care about customer service and good edicts I will never go again and if you want good food it's a waist of money"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken chowmein and crab wontons.  The wontons were glorified chips and the sweet and sour was extremely watery."}
{"text":"Pros: Online ordering. According to GrubHub.com, you cant order online. However, if you go to their actual website, you can.  Decent prices. Good spring rolls. Great fried rice. Quick delivery. I ordered online at 6pm and had my food by 6:30.  Cons: The chicken in the chicken fried rice. As far as the rice went, it was great. Full of flavor. The chicken was meh. Lots of dark marks and lots of pieces attached by a thin string of fat. Watery sweet and sour sauce. Bad crab puffs. I really hate when Chinese places put \"Crab Puff\" on their menu, and when you get it its just a wonton filled w/ cream cheese. Its very disappointing. And thats what youll get if you order the crab puffs here.  Lastly, and this for me is one of the biggest factors in choosing a Chinese restaurant, their hot mustard. They only serve the faux \"hot mustard\" in packets, the stuff that when you taste it tastes more sweet than hot. Boo.  Overall, a meh experience."}
{"text":"Seems to be pretty typical of a mom and pop Chinese restaurant....Table in the corner that the owners' family sits at...their kids running around.  This was my first time eating there. I opted for takeout. The chicken fried rice was really tasty and the chicken lo mein was also good. Looking forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"I really try to be understanding about food taking some time. I am very willing to wait for quality food. Its actually my tagline for yelp...however, this place takes too long to get my to go chow mein out, I mean...its chow mein! I order it because its quick.  Wouldn't be so bad if it were better, or I could get the guys behind the counter to give me duck sauce at least.  BTW, what is it with Chinese places and duck sauce? They seem to act as if they have never heard of it, every time. Although it says 'duck sauce' right on it. If you only get it when you order duck, fine. Tell me that, I can accept limitations. Its just when there is a blank stare or, even better, a \"We don't have that\" (when I can clearly see it) that annoys me.  You get a good amount of food, its pricey though, a drink and dish, not a combo, are over $10. Again, if it were better..."}
{"text":"The food is always hot & fresh - fast, friendly service, too. The orange chicken is to die for!!! I don't just go eat at Chinese restaurants, I have to go on a recommendation, so if that's what you need also, I highly recommend this restaurant. Never a bad meal!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place in a strip mall. Doesn't look like much from the outside but looks can be deceiving! GREAT food! Everyone is always very friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. Try the house chicken extra spicy. It is the best!"}
{"text":"I would never eat here again nor recommend this place. The egg foo young is disgusting. I asked for sweet & sour sauce for my crab ragoon. Long and behold no sauce. The service is not good either."}
{"text":"I honestly can't write enough good stuff about this place. Back on the west valley there's this place Chen wok which i loves and this place is EXACTLY like this!  Great food, fast service, friendly employees.  I will always be back to this place"}
{"text":"Great servings for a low price. The best Chinese I've had in the area. Egg drop soup is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We came in last week to order takeout and we will be back. The food was cooked well and very tasty. I'm kind of picky about my hot and sour soup and theirs was great! Everything else we ordered was great too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This Chinese takeout place is Awesome! The food was great. The people where polite and gave overall great customer service. My wife and I really had no complaints."}
{"text":"This is good Chinese food.  The Pork Fried Rice is to die for.  Great prices and large portions you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I would buy your first day this is one of the best Chinese food places so I've been to in a long time. I'm very basic when it comes to my orders for Chinese food I get the broccoli beef asking for it to be a little bit spicy and they make it perfect every time. I find this place to be very affordable, they do deliver and their staff is very friendly. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just finished our first meal from here and have to say that will probably not be ordering from them again. We ordered crab puffs, twice cooked pork and garlic shrimp but there was very little flavor to anything. The crab puffs were mostly won tons with minimal filling and the dipping sauce was like orange colored water. Very disappointed even after adding hot mustard which luckily I had on hand because they only provided soy sauce."}
{"text":"Love their food. They give you so much food! Love their egg rolls. Food is always fresh. Tried their broccoli, noodles, and kung pao all great. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese take out. They always make my orders perfect. They are always friendly and my food is always yummy."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering here and when I called this evening, I got a polite man on the phone that took my order quickly and efficiently. He told me that my food would be ready in 30 minutes and it was delivered in 20. the delivery guy was polite. I ordered the chicken lo mein with no onions or bean sprouts combo and an order of crab puffs. Everything was hot and fresh and tasted great! Thanks guys! You totally rock!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special with a good amount of food but the quality really isnt there. I have had the chow mein which was ok, the orange chicken was better but still not great. But if you are in a pinch and want cheap chinese this is the place."}
{"text":"I got fried rice and orange chicken. Just as everyone says, the orange chicken is very delicious and the best I've ever had! The fried rice is also the best I've had in Tempe so far. I really enjoyed my meal and it is my new go to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love Chinese take-out.  It's a good night just hanging out at home and watching a good movie while eating Pork Fried Rice and some Egg Foo Young.  As of yet, I have not been to too many Chinese food places in Tempe, so my rating may be a little inexperienced.  However, I felt that the prices were very reasonable and the portions were pretty big.  As far as it goes, its pretty standard Chinese take-out...nothing too great or special but I just love Chinese food so much and it is good so Golden Egg Roll gets 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mongolian BBQ and it needs to be spicy, the first place I've found where they actually listened to me and made it spicy. It felt like heaven. The orange chicken was pretty blah, and the sauce didn't have the slightest hint of orange.  The portions were pretty tiny as well.  Even with all that, will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Overheard some coworkers talking about this place and they said it was really good. Reading the reviews, I was less confident in eating here but decided to do it anyway. Ordered a ton of food. Beef skewers, egg flower soup, orange chicken, pot stickers, low mein, fried rice and egg foo young. I didn't try everything yet, but the beef skewers and egg foo young were both excellent. Everything else I tried was really good. They also had everything ready quickly and for as much food as I ordered, it wasn't that expensive. Definitely will be going here again."}
{"text":"The Golden Egg Roll is convenient as it's right near where I live. For the food and the price, I have to say they offer a good value. However, it's not the most flavorful Chinese food I've had. But it's much better than Rice King.   One thing is for sure, when you get it, it is HOT! Because of this, you'll know it's fresh out of the pan into your mouth."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch and I'm a big fan. Nice sized portions at a reasonable price. The orange chicken is delish!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, Beef & Broccoli and Pork Chop Suey. Hot, fresh, crisp, Really good!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was quick. I had the sweet and sour chicken combo which came with steamed rice (sub fried rice for $1 more), a square of wonton and egg roll. This was more than enough food and generous lunch portion. The sweet and sour chicken was moist and despite having a good amount of breading on it, it was still good. The fried rice wasn't too oily as other reviewers mentioned. The egg roll and wonton I probably could have lived without and will likely not order again. But for those who like egg rolls, these are large, vegetarian, and loaded with shredded and peppered cabbage. I am in this area weekly and will most likely be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Co worker order a chicken and vegetable dish and found a bug in her meal. I'm never gonna eat at this location ever."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!...this place should just give up and close.  Egg rolls just tasted terrible. Spring Rolls were fried but not fully cooked. Sweet & Sour sauce  tasted like \"sweet & sour\" cooking oil. Orange chicken was overcooked with a sauce that tasted like orange-flavored cooking oil. Sweet & Sour Chicken had same disgusting cooking oil flavor. The only good thing was the white, brown & fried rice."}
{"text":"I like the orange chicken here. Its a little dry so ask for extra sauce. I got it with fried rice which was good not great."}
{"text":"This is real poor quality Chinese . Order 4  entrees they all tastes the same . fried........ no sauce flavour ......... real bad American fried food"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people say its the best Chinese food. The food didn't taste good, the egg rolls felt like they were made the day before and reheated, the presentation in a Styrofoam plate looked like cheap cafeteria food. I know places that are cheaper, have better presentation and most importantly the food tastes good. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever!!! I have been ordering from this place for the last 8 yrs. My favorite is the sesame chicken combo! I know the last few orders delivery has been within 30 min which is outstanding because before then they say 45 min, but expect a hour. Its well worth waiting a hour so plan ahead. I love the little lady that answers\"Gowden Eggwoll, how can I hewp you\"!!! When you hear that your gonna get some bomb Chinese food."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great lunch specials. Great prices. I have never had a bad experience in the 8 years I've been going to Golden Egg Roll. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great service!!  Fast & always friendly!!!  :-). I will be back & recommend to a friend. I ordered the pepper steak from the lunch menu...... Simply delicious!!"}
