{"text":"Saw Cory W was a 1st-to-review and so I wandered on over.  Beautiful structure and very nice bistro.  They have both a hot buffet and made to order entrees for breakfast.  Plus Enderly Coffee.

I chose the buffet and thought it was good for what it is--a buffet.  Next time I'll order ala carte.  I ding one-star simply because the bistro has more a commercial feel like a hospital than an stand alone restaurant.  All in all I say, Give 'em a Whirl!"}
{"text":"There are very few non profit restaurants in Charlotte, but this is one of the best. Low prices on homemade local food. Supporting job training in the Community and food service training for the employees is just a bonus. Breakfast and lunch. Daily specials. I got baked chicken, mac and cheese and collard greens for $7. PLEASE give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Today I had a very enjoyable breakfast at Community Table Bistro. The food was delicious -- I've never had better bacon anywhere, and the grits were perfectly cooked and more than I could finish.  I saved my big biscuit for later, but it looks house-made and worth waiting for, as does the serving of peach jam that came with it.  My companion got a breakfast burrito, made to order, and he ate every bite.  Total bill, adding in coffee, was about $11.  So, the food was very good and very low priced, but what really makes this a place I will travel across town for is the people and the little touches.  Every member of the staff welcomed us and showed real care for our comfort and enjoyment. It was my first visit, and I felt like Norm walking into Cheers.  The special touches include a delightful collection of dinner plates on which the food is served - each one a different dish pattern - that are not mere decor, but serve as a subtle reminder that this is a Goodwill facility.  More plates and serving dishes are displayed in a case above the serving line and mounted on the walls.  It's a special place, and I'm already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Outstanding cod, the only thing that would've made it better is if they had homemade chips. Great staff and wonderful sides. Incredible concept. Bravo Goodwill.

The menu continues to evolve. Noodle Bowl Wednesday is great. New falafel burger is outstanding."}
{"text":"As we came into a large room, the short line formed to the left. Today's selection were rice bowls although you could get rice, noodles or dumplings. I chose the dumplings. Then you choose your veggies: carrots, boc choy, mushrooms, squash. Then a meat chicken or shrimp. Next, you choose a stock. I chose the mushroom stock. Everything was excellent. The staff were very nice and helped us first timers through the process! We will be back"}
{"text":"This is an unassuming little spot on the Goodwill campus that opened recently near the airport. It's about time the goodwill outlet has an eatery nearby since time can get away from you when you are digging and next thing you know you've got a full bin and haven't eaten all day. When it finally opened I was excited to try it out. 
   On offer they have a daily special, something southern such as pot pie or bbq chicken with a daily selection of sides. The special with sides runs around 6 or 7 bucks. They also have a steady selection of made to order sandwiches.
So far I have been twice. 
   The first time I got a side of collards and a side of the squash casserole per the lady at the counters suggestion. The collards were cut big like I like and were cooked to the perfect consistency, however they were sinfully under-seasoned, if seasoned at all. The squash on the other hand was delicious, if anything it was just a little short on the squash. The secret ingredient seems to be garlic croutons...I know, first time I am hearing this too, but it tasted great so who cares.
   Second trip I got a grilled pimento cheese on wheat with tomato. EXCELLENT. The sandwiches are a la carte as far as I know but this was a top notch cheap grilled pimento cheese, maybe one of the best in town.
   Stop by and support the cause if you are in the neighborhood looking for some good cheap food. As much as it pains me to say this spot is miiiillleess better than Carolina Family Restaurant. And try the pimento cheese FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place!!! We weren't even really.sure what it was exactly so we walked in to check it out...   they were just cleaning up after lunch, so we got some of the previous packaged goodies that are available. The egg salad was so good... as was the tuna wrap. We each got an ice cream and it was amazing. There's something to be said for locally sourced ingredients. We will definitely be back."}
