{"text":"Tried to eat here last night.  Was pretty full.  The hostess sat us in the back room which usually isn't a problem.  We waited almost 7 minutes and i then asked the hostess if we had a server. She said she would find out who it was.  After waiting another 5 minutes no one showed up and the hostess didn't return to let us know she had notified our server. In the mean time the hostess had sat 2 other tables in the back room. I guess business is so good they don't care if people leave. oh, she did thank us on our way out!"}
{"text":"Worst calzone I've ever had. The crust was thin, soggy and no cheese inside. All the other food was terrible. Keeping this short and simple. Definitely will never be back."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. Lots of real cheese, delicious crust, and packed full of ingredients! Whenever I crave pizza, I call Uncle Sam's!"}
{"text":"No Stars --- Nothing to speak of !!! A sub shop that ran out of white sub rolls at dinner time \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\" Didn't even have enough common sense to offer a discount on a very sub par pizza!!  Never will I return to this location again.... Terrible customer service and really poor management skills.
 THE TICK -TOCK IS MISSING FROM THIS CLOCK!!!"}
{"text":"Went here randomly one night and was glad that we did.
We ordered a mushroom cheesesteak, 6 honey BBQ wings, and a personal pizza. 
The cheesesteak was not greasy with the right amount of cheese and onions.  It could of had a bit more mushrooms.  The bread was perfect biting into the cheesesteak.  
The honey BBQ wings were surprisingly good.  The flavor of the sauce was not overpowering at all.  Only downside was that I should have ordered the bakers dozen.
The personal size pizza was very cute.  We had a two topping with ham and pineapples.  The dough was perfect!!!  I enjoyed the whole pizza down to the last bite.  
The service was really good.  Our waitress was very attentive and asked us how the food was more than once (maybe she forgot she asked us).  
I would definitely come back here for some good wings and pizza."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the price isn't too bad. I go there often as the mushroom cheese steak tastes good and you get a lot of food for your money. The decor is cheesy, but not unexpected for a place dubbed uncle sams. Staff is nice and have taken care of us when there has been problems."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! The food is super good! I ordered a mushroom cheese steak and an order of fries. I would say it took the perfect amount of time to make it to my table. Not to quick that I know it was not fresh and not too slow that I had to figure out where my food was. 

I'm pretty sure they don't make the rolls in house but I'm guessing they are made fresh daily. My bread was still moist when it got to me. 

The steak was sooooo great too! It was cooked perfectly, made right, and chopped up into tiny bits. The fries were also made fresh! 

The happy hour deals are something to write home about as well! Great place! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since high school and really enjoy it. The pizza is very good and love the hot ham and cheese grinder. The prices have continued to creep up and it is a bit pricey.  Will keep going as it brings back good memories.  I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Just had some pizza and wings from uncle sams and i wasnt dissapointed, ive been saying i was gunna try this for 11 months now but i use to go to the one on cactus when i was younger so this place was always kinda cool to me but anywho the food was delicious the chicken wings were high quality chicken and the pizza was primo chief, will def be back"}
{"text":"Ordered a good sized order for pickup. Wings, roast beef grinder, mushroom pepper cheese steak, fried mushrooms, fried mozzarella sticks, and a calzone. The order taker was very friendly and the food was ready when expected and complete and looked pretty darn good. 

Unfortunately we have decided that the third time is not the charm. The cheese steak although huge seemed fairly bland, the roast beef grinder looked great but was also bland, the calzone was a pasta sauce overload, and many of the wings were undercooked and raw, though the medium sauce had good flavor. The mushrooms are pretty good and the mozzarella sticks are frozen but good (heavy breading and good sized) but overall all of the \"fresh\" food was described as lacking any real flavor. 
This echoes the last few times we tried and I think we forgot it was this lackluster. If the kitchen staff would toss in a Lil salt and pepper and some seasoning it might make a difference. 

Positive : Customer service and front desk staff is doing their part. The bread is great. Wings had good flavor. Large portions.
Negative: The food sounds good but doesn't deliver you to flavor town. The menu doesn't describe the items well. Raw chicken is never good.

My guess is that some better kitchen management is needed, or at least a tasting and quality assurance overhaul."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/2 chicken sandwich and it was like a foot long sub and damn good. I assumed it came with \"pizza sauce\", as I guess I misread the menu. It was pretty plain with just chicken and cheese, but I went to the counter, got some sauce, problem solved."}
{"text":"Been going to SAMs for years. Maybe decades. Alas, they seem to be slipping in quality. I hope they don't fade into great places that once were. It's a local hangout and always had a great vibe.  
To then owner.  Take care of your legal issues and focus on the basics of SAMs."}
{"text":"I was always pleased with my cheese steak here, until this past visit.  I bit down on my sandwich and drove a piece of sliced up bone into my gums.  I searched the sandwich and found four large pieces of sliced up bone.  No way I can go back here.  Good if you don't get one with a bone, but now it is always going to be in my mind."}
{"text":"Uncle Sams has been one of my favorite pizza places for as long as i can remember. Great wings too!!"}
{"text":"So bummed . Just moved back to the area and drove over after moving for 2 days and looks like they have closed! Didn't get the steak sandwich I'd been craving ... :("}
{"text":"This is one of my other top favorite places to visit while I am in the Scottsdale area....  After 5+ years of being gone, I was back and polished off a whole mushroom cheese-steak.....  glad to know I could still put down the whole 18\" without any issue....

I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good cheese-steak!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Philly so I appreciate good Pizza and Subs (Hoagies).  I have been going to Uncle Sams for a few years now.  I have usually enjoyed the food and the service was never anything to write home about, but it was never outright bad.  Lately the service and food have been sub-par.  I am not sure why.  It's unfortunate because we used to really like Uncle Sams.  

I recently found my self calling the Owner Bret about an especially bad experience.  Even though the entire meal and service was not acceptable, all I asked Bret for was $15.00 back for the to-go large pizza the server jammed in a small pizza box.   The slices hot from the oven were stacked on top of each other (see pic).  Are you kidding me??? 

Needless to say I tossed the pizza out and ordered another Pizza from Papa Johns for my kids that were waiting at home for dinner.  

I figured asking for the $15.00 was reasonable.  Guess not.  

Bret declined to credit me the $15.00 saying it was his policy not to give refunds.  Rather he offered me another Pizza.  No thanks.  Guess he doesn't get it ... Its not the money - Its the principal."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! This place doesn't even deserve 1 star! My family and I ate here a couple weeks ago and we were extremely disappointed. Not only did our food take close to 30 mins to come out but when it finally did come out it was unappetizing! We order a pizza that had about a pound of grease on it. Blotting it with napkins didn't help one bit with the over abundance of grease. My son ordered a cheese steak that had barely any cheese on it! What kind of place sells cheese steaks that have absolutely no cheese on it! Uncle Sams does! Apparently to get a good amount of cheese on your \"cheese steak\" is going to cost you extra, since the cheapskate owner charges for extra cheese. Also my daughter ordered a pepperoni and sausage Stromboli that was burnt and completely soggy. Needless to say this was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant! I couldve probably gotten a better experience at McDonalds. We will never be going back, not even if you paid us a million dollars. Nor will we recommend this place to anyone. If your looking for crappy food and poor service then check this place out!"}
{"text":"They ripped us off! They placed a Val-Pak electronic coupon in which if you buy $40 worth of food, you receive a $10 credit. We ate our dinner, received our check, gave the electronic Val-Pak coupon with code and scan symbol and the Manager refused to honor it, saying the owner instructed him not to, and it had to be printed out. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that it had to be printed out and again it contained the OCR scan symbol and an alternate code for the cashier. They called the Police Department on us! Even the Manager acknowledged that it was misleading but his \"hands were tied\" by the owner. Bad experience.....left a very bad taste in our mouth about this owner and his business and we will never return. 

I do also see several other reviews on this place that comment on the owners poor behavior towards his employees, and failure to make good on his \"special offers\". 

I do also remember when the sandwiches in this place contained a lot more steak, and were considerably less expensive. The value has definitely gone downhill and it in my opinion the owner is getting more and more negative and hardcore in his attitude towards his customers and employees. Very disappointed in the downward turn....."}
{"text":"Food came out torched. 2 stars because the waitress had a smile. However, upon asking for a discount on the burnt food, she replied that because I ate what was inside the stromboli and left the bread alone, she wouldn't even discount it.... doesn't make sense because she offered a new one in place of it. Same amount of food, but would make me wait longer for my food to be cooked correctly. How could 1, the cook serve it being burnt.... 2, waitress bring it out burnt? Unless we were being served by 2 blind people.. poor choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Best cheestake in AZ and I'm from Philly. Italian hoagie is above average too, for AZ at least. Great happy hour for beer can't beat it. Very simple menu. Pizza is ok too. Only problem is they play music most of the time when good sporting events are on. Not really a sports bar."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have been in for a cheese steak and they have been out of wheat bread. Why have it on the menu if you never have it. Clearly there is a customer demand for it and you should have more."}
{"text":"Food was decent and prices were about par. The service this time was not up to expectations this time and the server was a bit lackadaisical but ok. I'll be back but will expect a better experience."}
{"text":"Both locations are a hit or miss but mostly a hit. When it is a hit, it's awesome and when it's not, it's still decent. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot.  Consistent good food, hefty portions, cozy atmosphere.  Good service, great specials.  In the top 3 as far as my vote for wings in the valley."}
{"text":"My family of 7 walked in and no hostess was there to welcome us. We waited about 10 minutes before being greeted and seated. Once we were seated no drink order was taken and after 20 minutes of waiting my family and I got up and left to head to another pizza location."}
{"text":"Choice was between Uncle Sams and Zipps. We obviously chose Uncle Sams,  which ended up being the wrong choice. This visit was the worst dining5 experience ever at Uncle Sams.  Only 2 other tables when we came in.  Ordered our drinks than our meals. Drinks arrived first and I cruised through my first pint of beer.  I asked our server to change the TV closest to our table to the Diamondback game. We heard her go5 relay the message to someone.  Our food was delivered and was never asked if I wanted another? beer or anything else to drink.  The TV still game bbeen get teen changed.  We see our server standing by the bar texting the entire time we are eating.  Never offered a refill on the water my girlfriend was drinking or another beer. At this point,  we feel like a burden to the server, which, miraculouslym she brought us. Needless to say,  very poor service and we will never be back because of it."}
{"text":"After a meal where my husband was served the wrong thing, my three year old son was burned by a faulty flood light in front of the restaurant that had exposed wiring and was wrapped in duct tape. He suffered second degree burns and ended up in the Arizona Burn Center because of his injury. The manager/owner of the restaurant called us back, but did not apologize. HIs response was that I should \"teach my kid to not touch hot lights\". Ok, well you should learn customer service and building maintenance you jerk!  Here's the entire story on my blog http://wp.me/pEqK4-gc. If they are so callous about service and maintenance, imagine how they are handling your food! My advice is to stay away from Uncle Sam's at all costs!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we are having 2 of Uncle Sam's best - the cheesesteak with mushrooms and extra cheese. The second sandwich is the All-American Grinder (lose the green  peppers and add a large amount of of jalapenos.)  all of this to go so we come watch a recordeding of the Tuesday night NCIS Los Angeles. Just could not get any better.  Hey we like eating at Uncle Sam just as much as the next person , bye you just can't beat take out from this restaurant , so fresh so hot so tasty."}
{"text":"They have a killer happy hour.  We usually get take out but dining in is good too.  I recommend the 4th of July pizza.  Good hot wings, cheese steaks, and grinders.  Always good service.  Killer happy hour."}
{"text":"The happy hour is unbeatable.  A premium pitcher for $6 (Fat Tire) or a domestic pitcher for $5.  They also have good happy hour food prices and a strong variety of options.  The waitstaff is willing to split checks in a variety of ways (for example, each person on the bill gets 1/3 of the pitcher if it was split 3 ways).  The pizza is so good that we order off the plentiful food happy hour menu for it.  The pepperoni's on the pizza are always crunchy.  Yeah buddy!

If you are lucky enough to have Kelly as your waitress, she will be attentive, friendly, and will split the check a variety of ways."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood joint. AWESOME happy hour and the honey hot wings are the best wings I have had. I always order pizza which is really good too. (I like to dip it in the honey hot wing sauce). Pretty reasonably priced as well.
Service is usually pretty good and fast.  

The only down fall is that they don't play any music or TV audio so if you're in there when its not very busy you can hear every conversation in the place. A little awkward."}
{"text":"great wings and great atmospehere...recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really love the food at this place.  Can't miss with a cheese steak sandwich of some hot wings.  I am probably Under stating it when I say the service leaves a bit to be desired.  If you go there for service you will leave unhappy.  If you go there because you are hungry, you'll leave full and in need of a nap!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the past month.. horrible service..horrible food.....dirty place.. had hair in my mozzarella sticks...half the time my grinder is half hot half cold... quality of the wings are garbage.. place really went down hill when all the illegals left and they brought in dirty ass cooks.."}
{"text":"the hostesses were great and sat us exactly where we wanted. our waitress brook was so nice and got all our sandwiches right!"}
{"text":"Change the name to 'Hit or Miss'. This place has never been the best but its always been close by.  My wife and I waited for 13 minutes before anyone noticed we needed a server. The person who noticed should have taken a drink order and shown some personality but instead she just grabbed another server who didnt greet us, offer an apology or even acknowledge the error. 'What can I get you to drink?'. Ug, we walked out. This place can be above average but the last few times it just seems like the customer is a nuisance. The owner needs to hire a trainer, take off all the political crap and work on consistancy in the front and back of the house. I'm into politics and like to hear all points of view, but you are alienating half of your potential customers, why? DETRIMENTAL"}
{"text":"Dive-y looking place from the outside. My snobby European buddy didn't want to go inside, but I chided \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" I ordered the philly cheese steak with mushrooms--no onions. He had the chicken sandwich no onions.  I read reviews beforehand so was excited to try the cheesesteak, but sadly disappointed. The meat had no real flavor and the bread was kind of chewy and tasteless. 

They had a large menu and selection of sandwiches and pizza.  Maybe I'll go back and try the pizza and wings. But the cheesesteak was just ok, a cut above Charley's."}
{"text":"Celebrated birthday dinner with my family which included several children and the food was great our waitress was wonderful and even the other customers didn't mind the \"ring around the Rosie\" going on in the corner. Thank you uncle sam's for the perfect evening!"}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong order and then refused to return my money. The wrong order looked terrible! Gross, Yuck & RUDE!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I will eat traditional wings, they are always crispy and I love their hot sauce! I hate traditional wings everywhere else they are always soggy and fatty but these are crispy and delicious. I also like their onion rings and their philly sandwich. Staff is super friendly and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Visited Uncle Sam's in Peoria for the first time on 9/25/10 at 7:35 P.M.  Wait was only 2 - 5 minutes and got to my table.  Waitress was a little flirty and suggested the Cheese Steak.  The place was more of a sports bar / pizza joint.  I ordered the Cheese Steak and Chicken Wings.  The wings were not very good.  I have had better in the valley.  The Steak and Cheese sandwhich was the best I have had west of the Mississippi.  I'm from Boston and was on the hunt for a great steak and cheese sandwhich.  You have found it!  It's a little expensive but worth the price for such a delicious meal!  

The pizza looked really good New York style and the fries were delicious as well.

I would go again and again!"}
{"text":"Best got sandwich place in town! Their food is crunchy, delicious and easy! We come here once in a while for a treat, and usually get the steak sandwiches. There sandwiches are crunchy and hot, but a bit dry. Always order extra ranch because that stuff is great and makes the sandwiches a lot better. Polite and nice waitresses, it's a small place with HUGE flavor!"}
{"text":"This place went so far downhill since 1996 when I remember coming here for the Philly cheesesteak

I ordered the cheesesteak hoagie
It came with no onions
And all three of us had gristle in our steaks 


I asked for the fries extra crispy and had to send them back


Swear the bread used to be like from Philly

But the texture is nowhere near Philadelphia

Guess it would be an okay place to watch sports because there's lots of TVs. 

But I traveled from Florida to come here for the Uncle Sam's cheesesteak 

what a disappointment!!!!"}
{"text":"It's quite simple. The food is great! The service is slow! And 98.9% of the time they will get your order wrong!"}
{"text":"$2.99 pitchers of beer from 4-6pm everyday. Doesn't get any better than that. Try their Bailout Plan menu."}
{"text":"Went there on December 24th 2011 the servers were very nice and the food looked and smelled pretty good. Unfortunately before we were able to eat anything a cockroach crawled across the table. It was a very small cockroach but still it was super gross. The manager (who I must say was very nice as well) said that the bug spray people had just been there last night, which I totally understand can drive out the bugs. I get that. Yes, bugs are a part life and yeah ok a random fly might slip in through the front door; so while i might be super grossed out I won't totally write the place off (unless there are more than one) but still I feel like unless I'm eating food from a street vendor in Thailand bugs of any kind shouldn't be a part of my dining experience. Especially in Scottsdale, I could maybe understand that problem in like a waffle house in Apache Junction, but in Scottsdale? Really?? And come on cockroaches? How much worse can you get? They are so disgusting, even teeny tiny ones; and everyone knows that it's pretty much guaranteed that if you see one (especially during the day) there's probably a whole lot more lurking nearby."}
{"text":"Our regular date night place. Never actually had their pizza, but their cheesesteaks are to die for. Only location we'll go to. Service is always great and they always seat us where we request. Awesome!"}
{"text":"It hurts me to type this. I used to LOVE the cheesesteaks at this place, but over the last couple of years, the drop in quality and increase in price has made me drop it as a cheesesteak option. The steak was very gristly and it tough. At almost $20 for a whole, I just can't do it anymore. I've never had the pizza, and their hoagies/grinders are pretty good. WHY, Uncle Sam's, WHY???"}
{"text":"We go there maybe twice a month for happy hour. Almost always sit at the bar. The atmosphere is certainly nothing special...the tvs have a weird set up, and they could stand to turn the music up to a level you can actually hear it. Mostly, you hear the clinking and clanking of the kitchen.

That being said, they have great beer specials... $1.75 domestic pints. And their mushroom cheesesteak is one of the best I've had. Have them add on grilled jalapenos...fantastic. the Italian grinder is pretty darn good too. And if you are a fan of fried zucchini, theirs is great. They are strips, as opposed to chips. Makes them turn out perfectly crispy, and not too greasy."}
{"text":"Love the cheesesteaks. Grinders and hoagies - great sandwiches.
Pizza with excellent melty cheese (request pizza well done -sometimes can be soggy). Ice cold beer - and wings done right."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving Uncle Sam's 5 stars is: the salads are meh and it's a bit pricey in my opinion.

On the other hand, the pizza is really, really good.  In my top 5 pizzas ever.  But what I crave the most from here are the Mushroom pepper cheese steaks.  This is comfort food at it's greasiest and finest.  I order it with peppers and banana peppers and it's fantastic.  Great wings, too.  I order them with extra medium sauce.  

I've had other items here, but basically, if you want the best of the best, stick with the pizza, cheese steaks, and wings."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan. The wings had no flavor and the fries we received looked and tasted like they were made 4 hours ago. Waitress was great. Watching games here isn't the best since the TV's are like 47 feet in the air."}
{"text":"O So good!! I usually get the Philly Cheese Steak w/ mushrooms and extra cheese. It is excellent. The atmosphere is Americanized which I love since everything around Central Phoenix caters to the Hispanics first then Americans.  Like I said the food is great, the reason only four stars is because the service sucks (Having to bring the waiter your cup for a refill every time I go there gets a little old) But other than that is definitely  worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"Had honey hot bbq wings to start they where good . Italian grinder for the old lady and I had the pastrami and cheese . Both where delicious . Our waitress was on point . We will be back"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars for the freaking awesome happy hour specials for beer and food! I mean where can you go for $4 pitchers in North Scottsdale??? I can come and get my drink on and some pizza and not be broke at the end which is a common occurrence in this area. Great pre-gamer for the night!"}
{"text":"I went after a Phoenix Suns game and it was easy getting seated.  After a long day, the waitress was very very nice.   

Very good hoagie (italian submarine). I love the warm bread with the cold cuts and sweet peppers.  

We also split Hot chicken wings and they definitely have a kick to them. My brother-in-law had two as it was a bit hot for him.  I thought it was really good and would order them again! 

This place is not fancy, just good food in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is brutal. Although I must say last time I was in it was good. But I've been coming here for years and the service for the most part is bad. The wings are really good, espically if you ask for extra crispy. The cheese steaks are okay. Happy hour is very cheap. Overall its an above average sports bar."}
{"text":"Used to get their pizza all the time, but its been a few years. Husband and I stopped today for lunch. Halfway thru my 2nd piece, a cockroach runs across our table. It had been in my husbands napkins. We showed the mgr. he said that they had been having problems but had sprayed. Don't think that I will go back. The pizza is good but apparently the old building has issues."}
{"text":"Nice folks. Sadly, the sandwiches are mediocre. Cheesesteaks are definitely big, but the meat has been overcooked in my experiences. There is no chicken parm on the menu, bul they pulled on together. Not terrible, Kenny."}
{"text":"I come here when I need I need my fried mushroom fix.  I think they buy their mushrooms because when I get a large mushroom, the inside is still frozen.  The good thing is that they are not stingy with their ranch...very generous.  Hubby usually orders the philly steak - they're just ok.  Chicken wings are large and very good.  Service is always good.  Overall, its an ok place, not outstanding."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Uncle Sam's periodically since 1991. Today was my last time. We attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser. I handed the server the card when I ordered. Only after we were done eating she came over with the check and informed us that we couldn't use the card as the single Pepsi didn't count towards the \"food order.\" I had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the \"owner's orders.\" I asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amount but being just $2.00 short in the \"food cost.\" He essentially told me that if that was how I felt he couldn't do anything about it \"owner's orders.\" If they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as I couldn't read the fine print even with reading glasses, and the server should have informed me of the fact when I ordered not after the meal was consumed. Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business. (The soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them, so the inflexible policy is inane.)

On another note the sandwiches are quite good although I can easily make a better Philly Cheesesteak at home. The pizza and wings are merely average. If you want far better wings go, to Sardella's."}
{"text":"This place was a huge let down. I've heard that it was good from other people and I've been here 2 times. Both times it wasn't that great.

First time I called and ordered a \"chicken steak sandwich\" with extra american cheese. Now in SJersey/Philly that typically means a chicken not Beef steak sandwich. The lady on the phone was actually rude
She said that's not what it's called...it's a chicken sandwich. I said I know that's what I want. Then she said...well that's not what you said! 
I know we're not in Philly and they have their own terms but that was just an ignorant way to handle it. 

Then I get the sandwich and it's cut up chicken breast's...basically cubes. So when you eat it they tumble out. Why not chip/slice it guys? That's the way everyone I know did it for cheesesteaks. #beNice 
Plus the service both times was very slow."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day so I decided to try it last Thursday.  I ordered their Pastrami Hoagie 16\" costing almost $17.  When I got home with it my wife and I were very surprised at the lack of Pastrami on the sandwich, we estimate about a quarter pound on a 16\" sandwich!!!  It was stuffed with lettuce though.  Shame on you selling a sandwich and not giving your customers a fair amount of meat!  I ordered Pastrami not a lettuce sandwich!  You certainly charge as if you have a quality product, get with it!"}
{"text":"With great sadness I find myself having to write a 2 star review for Uncle Sam's.  We started being regular customers around 2000 at a former location in Scottsdale.  Each meal was fantastic!  Quality never varied. When they closed this location, we only made it to the Shea and 32nd St. location 2x a year when we had business nearby.  We savored that treat for days before we went.  The last time we picked up food to go was near the end of 2016.  I always order the same thing: Steak and Cheese sandwich (with peppers and onions and mushrooms) and a side order of fried zucchini. I noticed that the steak had two or three inedible pieces of gristle.  Since it never happened before I cut them some slack figuring they just got some bad meat. Everything else in our order, the stromboli and zucchini remained excellent.  So yesterday we found ourselves in the area and ordered takeout for a Saturday night feast. Shockingly, I ended up WITH A PILE of gristle I had to pull and spit out of my mouth!  This is inexcusable!  This was no mistake but a deliberate cut of cheaper meat.  To add insult to injury, they raised prices on their menu about 30% on most things, I keep a take-out menu of theirs and grab a new one every time we visit. The price for my 1/2 sandwich (huge!) went from $8.55-$9.05-$9.99.  And now I get a cheaper cut of meat with the awkward embarrassment of pulling gristle out of my mouth at the table.  The zucchini went up also, from $5.25-$6.25-$6.50.  That was still very good, but many places can do zucchini.  We won't be back again. It wasn't a one time fluke.  I'm throwing away my menus.  A great place down the tubes. Oh, and if you scroll down you will see that others have experienced the same gristle.  As always, suspect positive reviews that refute numerous same food item complaints as there are companies that establishments pay retainers to to saturate media with false positives.  I knew someone who worked at one."}
{"text":"Eh. Ok food, high school waitresses, blah bar. Wish I liked it more, but blah."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed this visit. The cheese steak had way less meat on it n if they chopped it any more it would disintegrate. They also changed their bread to a fatter roll meaning more bread which was to much. Oh well. I'm from Philadelphia n Uncle Sam's was my favorite place to go but not any more."}
{"text":"The cheese steak was horrible! I am a fan of most cheese steak sandwiches. The steak was chopped so much it was more like hamburger. There was some cheese in it but just barely, I think it was half a slice of provolone. The sandwich bread resembled a hot dog bun. I ordered the sandwich with hot peppers which were sliced pepercinnis in a small plastic cup on the side. Everywhere else serves better cheese steak sandwiches. Yes, even Subway has a better cheese steak and I would never get that from there. My kids had personal cheese pizzas. Short on the sauce and cheese and over cooked. My wife had a chicken sandwich and that was ok. Our waitress was young and cute and she made friends with my kids. She forgot the side of ranch twice but her winning personality made up for the oversight. Uncle Sam's I have never given a review before. I hope to give this one and save first timers from the shocking disappointment of your food."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming to this place, it fails me every time with a corresponding trend. The food service and management are all terrible. The last time a came I was sitting at the bar when I overheard a waitress using vulgar language towards other customers and employees!!! I over heard the server say,\"stop f**king talking to me I'm f**king busy and you're annoying me\" while it seemed to sort of busy there's no excuse to use that type of disrespect and  language towards another employee let alone another customer. I talked to the man and he said her name was Shane I think. I then flagged down my waitress and asked her to notify the manager about what I had just heard because ALL THREE OF THEM seemed too busy to check how everything is going in the dining room and bar area. My waitress then apologized on my behalf, promised to notify the manager and gave me my  bill. This was yesterday. I don't plan on returning to uncle SAMs again and hope that this place gets shut down"}
{"text":"Had a 14 inch pizza plus 25 wings and an order of rings.  The Rings are so good.  If you stop by a must try.  The pizza was delicious,  a good thin crust za.  The wings are what we came here for me and my bud like to try wings at new places. Saw the reviews were in the area. So let's go.  The waitress was sweet and provided great service. She did bamboozle us a lil hence only 4 stars hehe.  We asked how the wings were.  She replied they are awesome.  So we ordered 25 hot.  She pauses then tells us that their hot is sometimes compared to other's suicide.  I love a good hot wing but not lookin for heartburn. Tellin us she loves hot stuff and can barely easy like 3 before it becomes too much.  So we order medium.  They were really good and she did bring us sides of the hot sauce to dip and try. It does have a bite.  I am lookin forward to my next visit and gettin the hot."}
{"text":"If you're planning to go with your family, stay away. If you just want beer and football, knock yourself out.
My review of this is based 90% on service, 10% on food.
My family and I will not return. 3 strikes you're out. Of the last 4 times we've been here, the service has been bad 3 of them. The girls that we've been stuck with have not been the brightest. They cater to the customers who are drinking. I've had to explain things to the servers a few times and a few of them look at you like you're speaking another language.
The owner leaves something to be desired as well. If a customer is unhappy and angry about service, shouldn't you do something to make the customer want to return? I guess not. So, we will go elsewhere from now on.

And one more thing, the wings have made my family sick the last few times as well."}
{"text":"best sandwiches in town. The service was friendly . The fries are amazing too.  I will definatly be back here !!"}
{"text":"As a Jersey Boy who grew up across the Delaware River from South Philly...always on the hunt for real cheesesteaks & subs, along with wings...well...my family and I found it in Uncle Sams...a simple menu but all items are prepared to perfection...in both quality & quantity.  The servers are all very efficient and genuinely friendly...the place has good energy too...lots of Tv's (I mean televisions)and digital music too...tap and bottled beer, wine...very casual, non pretentious place...we're regulars...check them out sometime."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is getting four stars from me specifically for its happy hour.

Everything here is at least as good as you'd expect from a divey pizza joint staffed by chicks in short skirts. Not my thing, but they were nice enough and I hadn't noticed until one of the guys I was there with commented. Our group was a little rowdy that night, but this is a great place for shenanigans.

The pizza? Thin crust with that low moisture mozzarella that re-melts after they cut it. You know, the kind you have to be careful with, because all the cheese will slide off your slice if you don't cut it again? In other words, delicious and exactly right for this type of place. The sides? Fried food, wings, huge sandwiches.

The (reverse) happy hour prices are what makes this place amazing. $3 pitchers of beer, smaller portions of hoagies, rings, fried mushrooms, wings, a 7\" cheese pizza, all under $4 each! This may be the most awesome place in town for a weekend late night snack."}
{"text":"Man this place has gone down hill! Use to be one of my favorites): came in tonight, our server (didn't tell us her name, wears glasses with a weird reddish hair color) must've been new, she didn't introduce herself or get our order correct. We ordered salads for an appetizer, wings & a Philly cheesesteak with extra cheese. All of our food came out at the same time, so at that point we didn't even want the salads. & half of our Philly cheesesteak had extra cheese?? A guest a few tables down from me had the same issue with their appetizer coming with the entire order & the manager who brought out his order walked away saying \"whatever douchebag\" unacceptable; you could feel the hostility throughout the restaurant. Last time we will be eating here unfortunately. Get it together uncle sams!"}
{"text":"2ND UPDATE - MARCH 2018:
WHY does my wife keep ordering from this place? Two nights ago they screwed up once again. Wings and fries is our go-to order. We always order the fries \"extra crispy\" because they are really great that way. When they're not crispy, they are average at best. It is always a 50-50 bet whether anybody actually makes them extra crispy when we ask for it. I was there to pick up our order... my brain said, \"check the fries to see if they were made crispy\". My patience said, \"no, don't: you're tired, you're not going to want to wait around for them to do it right.\" Sure enough, I got home and the fries were not done extra crispy. UNCLE SAM'S, THE CRISPY FRIES IS WHAT KEEPS US COMING BACK AND LITERALLY HALF THE TIME YOUR PEOPLE SCREW IT UP.

Then there's the wings. Two orders of wings, BBQ and Mild flavors. Both undercooked. The \"Mild\" wings, you could have fed them to a baby. No kick whatsoever. That reminds me, the wings are wildly inconsistent. Sometimes they are wet; sometimes they are dry. Sometimes the wings are plump and meaty. Sometimes they are neither. Even the celery and carrot slices that nobody ever eats, they were limp and inedible. 

I've laid down the law: WE ARE DONE DONE DONE WITH UNCLE SAM'S.  I will gladly drive the extra distance to Oregano's: their wings are much better and they are consistently good. Also, I feel better about patronizing a business that doesn't treat its employees like crap, like the owner of this place does.

UPDATE 2-March 2016: Downgraded from 3 to 2 stars. The service is even worse than usual. To-go orders regularly screwed up. The food is so-so. The pizza is good but it's greasy and hilariously overpriced. We would always order wings and the quality varies greatly. About 1/4 to 1/3 of the time they are plump. The rest of the time they are scrawny. Yet more evidence of the owner cutting corners. Sometimes they come out drenched in sauce; sometimes they are dry with barely any sauce.  The wings at Oregano's are so, so much better.

Phoenix PD and DPS used to be seen here all the time, now you will never see them here, ever. Must be something to do with the owner's well-publicized bust for using illegal labor. Everyone I talk to has noticed the drop-off in parking lot traffic; it's seldom as crowded as it used to be.

The owner is also not someone who should be supported by the neighborhood, as he has chosen to put some really sleazy businesses in the nasty strip mall he owns behind the restaurant.

We kicked our Uncle Sam's habit (it used to be our go-to place when we didn't want to cook) and haven't looked back. Go down to Tatum and Shea and try Corleone's for pizza and subs. Better food, better prices.

=======================

UPDATE: Uncle Sam's seems to have their act together again. Unfortunate that the owner chooses to make this neighborhood seedy by leasing space to a pawn shop and a head shop. I've observed  him or his kid driving like an arrogant jerk, too. If my business' name was plastered all over my car, I'd be sure to be a courteous driver.

=======================

Newly re-opened after Sheriff Joe's raid, the 32nd St. Uncle Sam's is still trying to get its act together. Been here twice since the re-opening. Food service is rather slow. Both times the waitress did not pay enough attention to our table. On the second visit, our waitress was obsessed with cleaning and straightening the empty tables and practically ignored us once the food was delivered. She also forgot our drink order, we sat for 10 minutes until getting our beverages.

The wings come out VERY dry. We will remember to ask for them wet next time, this never used to be a problem.

I would advise you to wait until next month (it's August 2013 right now) until the staff and kitchen is back in its old groove.

This leads me into another topic, what bothers me more than these failures is the owner's very obvious tightfistedness. Use a coupon from the mailer? It better total at least $25.00 to the penny or you won't get your $5 off. Even if you mention at the start that you have the \"$25/$5 off with two drinks\" coupon, the waitresses will not tell you if you hit the $25 when you make your order unless you ask them to, and I don't trust them to do the math anyway. What's worse, none of the staff nor the manager has the latitude to honor the coupon if you fall a little short. One time we were denied use of the coupon because our order had totaled $24.95. A FREAKING NICKEL SHORT. We talked to the manager and it was very apparent it was not his call to make and that he would have gotten in trouble for cutting us a break.

On our first visit to the  re-opened Uncle Sam's,  the service was so painfully slow they should have - any good restaurant would have - comped us something. The drinks, the fries, something. Nope. That will never happen here.

Uncle Sam's we like your food but we're getting a little tired of making excuses for your shortcomings."}
{"text":"Worst service you could ever imagine. I was there over the weekend to pick up my take out within the time frame they gave me. The lady at the front counter was rude even though I was polite. You could also hear the cook yelling and swearing and couldn't control his emotions. 

If I had to choose between getting a finger cut off and coming back to this place, I would rather get my finger cut off."}
{"text":"My family really likes uncle sams. It is kind of pricey for 5 of us so we decided to go there the other day because I had a coupon out of the entertainment book. ( I am a big couponer)  We really picked the restaurant because I had a $10 of coupon or we would have went somewhere else.  (we sometimes get kids meals and just so you know they are like 6 or 7 bucks. One of the highest prices around. My kids are older so sometimes we do just get pizza to share)  So anyway the coupon says their name on it. Uncle Sams, it said it was good until november, and it had their specific address on it (it was the one on 83rd ave).  So already get drinks and order food and we have been sitting there a bit.... I say to the waitress oh by the way we have this coupon. She takes it and leaves for awhile and comes back and says the manager says we haven't take those in a long time.  I mean what are we going to do leave???  So we had to talk to the manager and all this stuff because we think it is ridiculous that it has their name, address and a future exp and they won't take it.   Why have the coupon in the entertainment book to begin with. Really it almost seems like bait and switch. They get you in there get you in there with the coupon, you are in the midst of eating and you don't find out until its too late they won't take it.    So anyway if you plan on going to the restaurant with one of those entertainment book coupons they probably aren't going to take it.....I am griping I just have never had a place do that before....their food is pretty good, you just can't do that to customers. It just gives the customer a poor feeling about your place....the good rating above is for the food..."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years.  Good food and good prices..  This is the place to go for good old american eating."}
{"text":"Some of the best (and most filling) cheesesteaks in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Reasonably priced, messy, TV's, waitresses who will not take any crap. Perfect for a lunch with a co-worker, buddies or someone else you are not trying to impress."}
{"text":"Yummy bar food & cold beer!!!

My mom and I come here for our \"cheat\" eating days and get onion rings, fries, chicken wings, and beer.  Uncle Sams serves nearly everything fresh out of the fryer!!

Last time we are here we tried the calzone, not a huge fan.  We got the italian which has sausage, pepperoni, onions, and bell peppers.  The dough was cooked to a crisp and not that pizza doughy goodness I was craving.  My mom was not enjoying the calzone either.  It wasn't bad- just kinda bland.  The ice cream is in a single serve plastic container- how lame!  The menu shows a dish with ice cream too... But then you get a can shaped plastic tube.

The servers here are so sweet and we always end up hanging out here for a couple hours.  And trust me, sports bars are not our usual scene AT ALL."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and never had an issue.  Just had dinner there last night and the service was great from start to finish.  The food came out hot and ready for us.  The Cheese Steak is always a hit as is the Chicken Cheese.  Had the Pizza before and the sauce is of a different spice than most.  It is really good, and not your ordinary tomato sauce.

Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"I've never been so upset eating here & I've been here dozens of times. I've even brought new comers, 5-6 times. Well, I wanted to try something new. I asked the waitress about the Strombolis. I've never heard of it but after the waitress explained it, it sounded amazing, so I went ahead and ordered it. When the food arrived it was burnt....not crispy, not even thin crust crispy....it was flaky and black. I asked her if this is the normal way....her response...wait for it....\"not typically, it does seem pretty over cooked.\" NOW. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years, so I knew it wasn't her.....even though I would've never serve what she placed in front of me.

Anyways. Politely, I asks for a new one.
15-20-35 minutes go by....
Two tables, that arrived after us left. 
My husband ate and my side dish got cold.

Finally my food arrives. Not only is it hard, dry and crispy, but it seemed like they had 95% water 5% pizza sauce. 
I took my first bite. Disgusted.
Asked my husband to try it. He was disgusted.

Getting the bill:
Only my -one- beer was taken off the bill.
I seriously think this has set me over the edge to never come again. Did I mention I live 45 minutes away?

Yep. Done."}
{"text":"The only thing I ever get here is the Cheese steak with mushrooms and peppers.  It is the best in town.  The ambience is 70's basement but that's OK...  Parking can be a challenge at lunch"}
{"text":"Always a family favorite! Amazing philly cheesesteaks and of course the pizza! Bring the whole family and invite tons of friends, this place is a hit!"}
{"text":"Update:    Ken, the manager, called me and apologized profusely for the delay I experienced today and extended a credit to me.  I appreciate the gesture and the customer service.  I have updated the rating because my guests enjoyed the wings.



Don't EVER order online for a next day pickup.  I thought I was giving Uncle Sam's plenty of time to have my order of wings ready for a pickup time of noon.  My order was not only not ready, but they started working on it about 12:10.    They had 18 HOURS advance notice!   They could be the best wings in the world, but I won't order from them again."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the staff was very friendly and the service was great. I had the meatball sub and ended up taking the meatballs off and throwing them away. The veggies, cheese, and sauce were great. The meatballs on the other hand were extremely dry and over cooked to the point where I ate one and a half and ditched the rest. It seemed like they had been sitting on a hot grill for days. I only left a two star review for the meatballs. I'm sure they have a lot of great food, but I will skip the meatballs and I suggest everyone else does until they figure out how to properly cook them. I will most likely return and try something else because of the friendly staff."}
{"text":"it's a shame people have been having such bad experiences recently.  i went today because i just read about their bailout deal and it was so tasty i wanted to go back tonight for the reverse happy-hour.  while 1/4 sandwich doesn't sound big, let me bring you to scale: a half-sandwich looks a little over a foot albeit sliced in two and side-by-side.  a 1/4 cheese steak and a 1/2 order onion rings (with ranch!) is the perfect amount.  i'll be going back as soon as i can"}
{"text":"We make a special trip to North Phoenix just for the Hoagie! It's the Bomb! Tried others, but they don't even come close! We don't get anything else, but I am sure it's all good!  I will definitely be back to get my Hoagie fix!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place...nothing but disappointments.  The server was rude and had no idea about the menu.  

Let's talk food....
Pizza - burnt.  Nothing special and greasy.
French fries - cold and frozen from a bag.
Wings - basic...so good but not the best.
Pastrami grinder - best thing of the night.  Good bread and flavor.

Overall nothing great...probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I am being gracious with this review because of the bailout menu. Everything on it is less than 4 bucks. So if the food isn't stellar it's okay because it's cheap. And their hot wings are yummy for sure!"}
{"text":"Is it me or is it me that every time I've gone into this establishment I've gotten wrong orders and dealt with the staff that doesn't seem to care. Today's the last time and shame on me from going in there today and walking out-with out my $11 sandwich."}
{"text":"Neighborhood pizza place. The pizza here is average at best.  The sauce on our pizza was bland. I ordered a garden salad that appeared to have been prepared on the plate for a long time before I ordered it. Lettuce was wilted and slightly brown on the edges.
Our kids do like their onion rings.
Many other better pizza places nearby to try before going back here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this local restaurant. My party of 3 people on a Friday night at 9pm had to wait over a half an hour for a GREASY, BURNT cheese pizza. I had to use several napkins to absorb the grease & couldn't even consider eating the CHARRED, BLACKENED crust. We were only given 2 forks, one of which was so bent, it looked like it had been used for origami. Reason for the shortage of forks? They had a big rush before we came in and ran out, so had no additional clean to offer. Waitress returned half way through our meal, telling us that they STILL had no clean forks. Finished our meal - forkless. Bathrooms - both male & female were SERIOUSLY BELOW standards. Toilet paper all over the floor, NO WAX PROTECTOR SEAT COVERS OFFERED & paper towels in the sink. An abundance of staff was on duty at the time, even though they were NOT busy at all with patrons, clearly they weren't put on dish washing or bathroom duty, either. GROSS! Cost-$28.00"}
{"text":"Have driven past this place many times & decided to finally try it. One of the draws was the
professional looking menu + advertising premium wine by the glass. The wine is terrible & I've never known a wine that is less than $7 in the store to be called premium, UGH.  Tried the calzone & it also was terrible due to the crust tasting like the generic wrapped supermarket bread from many years ago; no flavor.  I have read that Sheriff Joe of Maricopa County is being sued by this place for raiding it looking for illegal Mexicans. Joe could have saved the county plenty of $$$$ & time as I don't think there are any Mexicans here, legal or otherwise, since they do know how to cook."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this venerable PHX landmark since i was in wonzies... okay so that may have explained my burgeoning childhood obesity. I dont care, layer on the calories, this place reminds me of everything i love about America and Phoenix. I doubt i could feel more comfortable than sitting with a cold one, wings and a chk cheese steak (mushrooms, onions, sweet/hot peppers and ex cheese please) watching some sports at uncle sams. I really think this place maintains an elite status as my best hoagie ever. Statement. Do yourself a favor, go, get a cheese steak, wings and maybe some pizza. Oh and the waitress which range from haggered to hot wear tiny skirts, dinner and a show baby."}
{"text":"This place needs to hit the RESET button. My last take out order was so awful we actually returned the pizza ( we never do that) yes we drove 10 miles back to return pizza.. It was that bad , pizza looked like it had been in the oven 10 mins too long and was sitting out for an hour..cheese was like plastic.. We used to love this place it was very reliable... Uncle Sams can be great again they just need to step up quality checks...not sure we will take out again we just might dine in to avoid driving the pizza back for return...  Sorry Uncle Sams I hate writing bad reviews but this visit was that bad..."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, can't complain about the food one bit. I've been here plenty of times and usually gotten good service, but the last 2 times I have been here, i've not only felt rushed but also felt like the employees AND management are kicking me out so they can go home.

The first time I went later at night, we got there around 9pm, not realizing they closed at 10pm. We assumed that like most restaurants the closing time meant that was the time that they seated people until. Obviously not the case here. Our waitress made it very clear that we were imposing on her by coming in so late. She tried rushing everything so much she got out entire order wrong. Once we finally got our food she brought our check with it as well and told us to have a good night. This seemed rude to me, as it was our servers fault we were there later than planned, but yet she was still rushing us out.

The last time I attended this location, it was a Monday night and the first Cardinals game of the season. I thought that maybe since football season started they would stay open later to accommodate customers who wanted to watch the games, I looked online and it said 11pm, so we headed on over for some food and football. Once we arrived we saw the restaurant advertising the football season immensley. While there, everything was great, up until about 10:15 when one of the waitresses started turning off every tv except for one. I asked a nearby bus boy what time they closed and he said 11. (turns out i looked at the wrong location) Regardless, it was rude to turn off the tv my table was clearly watching the entire night. So we went on watching the only tv they left on. Not more than 15 minutes after that we paid our bill and as we did we heard who must have been the manager scream \"Okay ladies let's wrap it up let's go\". He was talking to his employees yes, but the message of what he said was directed to whoever was left in the building. We quickly got up and left, not even getting to finish watching the football game(which had 1 minute 39 seconds left). 

If you're going to advertise all this football stuff then at least stay open until the game is over so your customers can watch.

Really irritating and will not be back. Loyal customers lost."}
{"text":"Although folks that have been coming here since there was only the one on 32nd and Shea say it has gone downhill, I still really like Uncle Sam's.  Indeed it has but we are talking from \"outstanding\" to still \"really darn good\".  If you want the old Uncle Sam's order your cheese steak with extra meat and cheese.  It costs a few bucks extra but the value is still there.  

Their dollar drafts at happy hour and \"bail out\" plan are some of the greatest values around.

They still have the best cheese steak in town when ordered as described above.

Service is always great along with the wings.  Can't speak on anything else because that is about all I've ever ordered for the last 25 years of patronage."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. I ordered a lettuce wrapped salami and provolone sandwich (suggested by staff). I received a plate with a few slices of salami over very little shredded iceberg lettuce. Huh? I asked for the cheese and the waitress returned with ONE slice and informed me I'd have to pay for extra cheese. 

What happened to making appetizing plates, presentation, and satisfied customers? It was my first and last visit to this restaurant. I'd recommend passing on it even if you're starving."}
{"text":"Never had a problem until tonight. Waited 40+ minutes for our waitess to take our food order. After years of patronage, I won't be back for a while. Sorry, but I'm a vengeful s.o.b."}
{"text":"What uncle sams has come too! It's a shame, good food but crapy service and not very clean!! Management has slacked big time (upper management). They can do better than this I definitely don't want to eat there again."}
{"text":"This place makes a great cheese steak (similar to Shaka Pizza in Maui)! I wasn't blown away by their pizza, but it works. The wings are on the warmer side when compared to other places. As others have experienced, the service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Amazing...even bought the tshirt. I live in Nashville now but remember this place from a kid. Their turkey and cheese hoagie is my favorite but the rest of my family gets the special. The service has always been great and my cup never runs dry. We've been here 4 days in a row so far and will probably be here everyday this week!"}
{"text":"Coming from living half
Of my life in the land of cheese steaks this place is very good.  Not philly just saying but every time I come to Phoenix I come here.  Good very good food."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the lack of overall customer service.  Maybe just a bad day? Seemed as most are there just to collect a check.  One person said thank you.  We had pizza and it was OK, a little raw though.  The booth we sat at was very tight will try a table next time.  We will try them again."}
{"text":"This place was totally not what I expected at all, although its hard to say what exactly I was expecting.

For anybody who is expecting a fast food quick service type of place this is actually a sit down restaurant that serves typical fast food items, but you have to wait for food like you would at any sit down restaurant. I was surprised because I didn't realize that there would be waiters. The service was pretty good and the waitress was very friendly. I wasn't impressed with the prices though. Its fairly overpriced for what they serve.

The food was not as good as I had hoped, but decent and unique. I had an Italian grinder, which was certainly not like any I have had before. The fries on the other hand were quite basic and not that good. The restaurant also looks completely bizarre. Its a really weird place that you just have to see for yourself.

All in all it made for an interesting and unique dining experience even though I wasn't in love with the food."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place?! They used to have great hot sandwiches. I hadn't been here for awhile and hasppened to be driving by and thought I'd get one of their hot grinders. I ordered the hot Italian, no fries and a beer. My order came, beer, sandwich and fries(remember,  I said no to the fries). The sandwich was ice cold, piled with lettuce, and get this; provolone cheese on top of all tgat lettuce, partially melted (must have placed it under broiler for a couple of seconds). This place USED TO BE a great place for subs, grinders, hoagies.... Don't recommend this place and I will never return. Time to close the doors."}
{"text":"Have not been to uncle Sam's on 32 st and shea  for a long time due to the food quality not being  what it used to be.  Thought we would give it another try...big mistake.  Ordered a 10\" pizza ...it was so dry and hardly any topping on it.  Got the fried chicken breast sandwich..now mind you it is like $10.00 for a half sandwich.  There was literally 3 small pieces of chicken on this sandwich!  You didn't even get a piece of chicken in each bite you took.  Just lettuce and tomato in some bites.  We used to go here at least once a week...and mind you we have lived in the neighborhood for 24 years.  Their prices have really gone up over the years and the quality had not stayed with it. We will never go back again!  Along with all our friends that used to go there too.  Too much great food out there to waste our money on poor food."}
{"text":"Great steak sandwiches!   Consistently good food and large portions!  Been going here for YEARS!  Only problem is they serve Pepsi products :("}
{"text":"I used to frequent US quite a bit when our friends lived here, ever since they moved we haven't been in much.   However we were driving by and my wife wanted to pop in not too long ago and we wondered what took us so long??  We went back today and I branched out and got the stromboli with sausage, mushrooms, and pepperoncini... I couldn't get thru the second piece.  It was nasty,  my wife on the other hand loved her grinder and the service was beyond phenomenal,  thanks Kaitlyn!  So if there is a next visit the stromboli is of my radar!"}
{"text":"The only reason I came here is because it was recommended by a friend. The first time I went the food was horrible and overpriced, but the service was fine. Today I came to watch football and the service and food were horrible. The place wasn't packed or busy at all. I asked to change the tv station to my football game. I missed the whole first quarter, that's how long it took them to change the channel. I ordered a calzone. The first one came out black, burned to a crisp. I can't believe they sent it out of the kitchen like that. I rarely saw my waitress. Took forever to get my second one to me after I sent it back. The second one wasn't much better than the first. They still burned the crust, it was hard as a rock, and the filling was cold. Their sausage also tasted like and looked like ground beef. I've tried you guys out twice now and have had two horrible experiences. I will no longer visit your establishment."}
{"text":"Love the cheesteaks and hotwings! Cant bring myself to try anything else and regret it. Everyone knows what I mean :)"}
{"text":"We come here about once a week because it's cheap, we never wait (though they are always busy) and the portions are a good size. Lots of choices in a variety of sizes - something to please everyone. Kind of like a diner/dive bar atmosphere but in the neighborhood, so very convenient."}
{"text":"It's was very hot and humid in here, the bathroom was a little on the spooky side. However, the water was quite refreshing. I got FREE LEMONS! The server was really slow but nice. My friends are cool we had fun. 3 stars. Most of us didn't have food but it smelled like you could eat it."}
{"text":"I had Pizza and wings at Uncle Sam's today and as usual it was really good.  The wings are ALWAYS tasty and the pizza is the best in the Valley in my opinion.  

Service is typically great.  Quick and always coming back for drink refills etc.  Good for watching sports but not a sports bar.  I like that.

The only reason this place doesn't get a full five stars is the parking at the 32nd Street and Shea location is always dicey.  Way too small and I'm always wondering if I'm going to back into someone, or if I'm going to be able to get out of my car!  

Once inside though everything is great at this neighborhood classic.  

(A little trivia... this was originally a \"Pizza Inn\" restaurant that was built in the mid to early 70's around Phoenix.  There was one in my neighborhood at 7th Street and Thunderbird.  Good times eating there back in grade school!)"}
{"text":"WTF! No idea what happened to this place. This was our jam.. but no more.  I t was my daughter's sweet 16. I told her to pick her spot, the only caveat was she could choose whatever she wanted.  She picked Uncle Sam's. Typically that would be great...but tonight,  everything was horrible! 

It started when we walked in. They tried to cram a party of six into a four top...the meatballs AND wings were burned..the service was non existent (until it was time to tip) ..missing food orders...no manager in sight.  I could go on, but I think you get it.  Oh and the arrogance...I said I would stop so I will.

We are done here. If you are nearby, pick something else.

{"text":"I would give it five stars except for the fact that when I asked if they had bleu cheese salad dressing they said no and the reason was because the owner hates bleu cheese. Order the white pizza. Thin crust with broccoli."}
{"text":"Shittiest service ever. I sit down at the bar top, waitress/bartender/food runner I have no idea who she was, says \"hey what do you want to drink?\" No formal greeting whatsoever. I ask for a water and a menu. I'm assuming the girl was upset that I was the \"water guy at the bar top\" because she brought me a water without the menu and then walked away. So I make eye contact with the next random girl behind the bar, ask her for a menu, she literally just shook me off and walked away. Now I'm upset. Finally a girl starts filling a draft beer in front of me, (side note the beer grate smelled so bad that I think if did eat there I wouldn't even be able to eat my food) and I ask her for a menu, I finally got one. I've been there a bunch of times, I pretty much knew what I wanted before I walked in the door but I just wanted to glance at a menu before I decided. So after glancing at the menu for a minute, I sit and wait for another random girl to approach me to ask what I want to order, but that never happened. So I ended up sitting at this bar top for 10 mins and received just a water and extremely shitty service. I will never spend my money at this restaurant ever again!! This place doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"I hate to do it.... I've been eating here since 2000, this is my favorite local family restaurant.  Tonight I'm dining in with my family of 5.   Ordered the usual zucchini and mushroom basket and ask for a few extra ranch... I'm told they charge for any extra containers.  The containers are 3 oz.   are you telling me that's enough for my 5 family members to share?  The 80¢ they want to charge for each extra isn't the point, it's common sense.. That's not enough for 5 people!!!! Totally ridiculous... Is it enough that drinks are 2.75 each?  Whatever... we've always enjoyed this place, but I'm not supporting this ridiculousness.  For the same amount of money, we could have and should have, and will be going to Hillstones's next time!   Thanks anyway Uncle Sams..."}
{"text":"This place sucks and they're very disrespectful. It's costs $40 for pizza and wings and the guy wild not take our coupon for 7 dollars off because it was a mobile coupon. It didn't expire for another month but he wouldn't use it cause it was off my phone and he said it didn't count. If your going to charge people 40 bucks for pizza at least accept their damn coupons"}
{"text":"So, I headed up to north Phoenix to visit my 88 year old dad.  He is bored because his wife wont retire so they can travel and have fun, but that is a different story.  I needed a excuse to stop at Uncle Sam's and that was it....   I walked in about 1pm and was seated promptly(big word)....    The nice young lady brought me a Diet Coke and a menu.  She returned two more times to refill my drink and then FINALLY asked me when the rest of my party were going to show up.  I told her that I was it....  She then was somewhat embarressed and offered to buy me a beer or something, so I excepted the free Diet Coke.  

I really came to Uncle Sam's to have a Meatball Sub but this time and the first time ever I ordered a pizza.    I waited................. and then she brought out a personal pizza for me....O-M-G!!!!!!     Now I know why people love this place!   It was incredible!!!!!    I cant even desribe it....  just perfect....  flavor was A-W-E-S-O-M-E....           so much so that I have been back one more time since then to have another.!!!!!!!    

BTW-- I think they have some good beer specials also.... BUT go for the pizza and enjoy.."}
{"text":"I think it really depends on what you order here. The wings are of the soggy kind, not the crispy, which I prefer. The pizza also looked average. Can't comment on the drinks since I can't order them yet.

However, I am a big fan of their cheesesteaks. They're pretty big and reasonably priced. I always get either a mushroom cheesesteak with fried onions or a cheesesteak hoagie with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Good sides have included standard fries, fried mushrooms and zucchini, cheese steaks, and even chicken tenders for the lol.

I think it's a good place for groups, and I've always been able to get a table. I've come for dinner and late at night, and takeout is always pretty quick."}
{"text":"Food is very good for the price. But the employees need some help with their manners. When I first walked in there was two girl sitting on the Togo counter talking with their backs turned and both turned around to look at me but did not greet me at the door. Don't get me wrong the girl actually serving me was quiet nice and did everything right. But then when I got my food two servers were in the booth next to me on the clock and were cussing talking about something that happened earlier. You should never talk about other customers infront of other customers and cuss. And as I left an other girl was at the Togo area and made eye contact with me and did not say goodbye to me. Overall they have good cheap food but the staff need to learn proper edicit."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted here, that I will just add the pros and cons and land in the middle with my rating. Uncle Sam's has what is arguably the cheapest Happy Hour drinks in all the Valley. Beer is a buck a pint and a half bottle of wine for 5 bucks! It goes until 7, so we usually squeak in just under the gun. The \"Bail Out Plan\" menu is also incredibly varied and cheap. They do lots of mailings and coupons as well. The food is good (not great), but always seems to satisfy! Service varies, but is generally quite speedy and good. The servers look somewhat hustled and overworked. 
I wish I could give the place a quick update of style and maybe some new floors, tables, and a different layout. It seems too crowded with tables and can get really loud. Word of advice: sit in the \"front half\". The back seems even more conducive to a panic attack from sitting literally right next to another table. They need a re-brand and some new plates and silverware. There is a small patio out front with some concrete tables. You can tell they keep the place clean, it just needs a makeover. We unfortunately have sat by some fellow patrons lately who seem to fight, forget they are adults in public and really seem to bring the place down. For these negatives, I give 3 stars. Uncle Sam's sure tries, but there is unfortunately some work to be done! 
However, if you like cheaply priced beer, wine and food, this place is for you! We keep going back!"}
{"text":"The service was good. Ill give them that. Their cheese steak sandwich was terrible. Meat and cheese and bread and a hint of sauce. Ive had a better chese steak sandwich arbys. The bread was great. The meat was over cooked and seemed like it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Barely any cheese and almost no sauce. Try somewhere else for a chese steak. Paid $8 for 9 inches of bleh."}
{"text":"That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for. I actually use to really like this place. Great happy hour. Good flavors on the wings. I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be. Like tonight, for example. I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew. Well... no. I got a full order. When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings, she offered to get me a box. I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one! A cockroach walks onto the bar. It was small and may have been a beetle, but still... ew! ! There goes my appetite!  

Words of advice.  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's, wear protection. Serves with mediocre at best. The gals working there are 12, so I don't expect much I suppose. However,  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like). I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings. Not good!!! Just decent. I think the beer helps. 

Long story short. If you have a party and want cheap cheapness... well then you've found... omg... an other cockroach just walked up on the bar! Are you absolutely kidding me!? Im seriously about to freak out and walk out. I don't care if I haven't paid. This is embarrassing!!! DO. NOT.  EAT. HERE!!!"}
{"text":"If it was not for the great wings I would give Uncle Sam's a 2 star.  The wings are great but the other menu items aren't good.  Too salty and/or soggy sandwiches.  I love wings so I do go about 1x/month but usually have to go alone since my wife is not a huge wing fan and dislikes all the other menu items.  If you go with your family for dinner ask to be seated away from the bar area.  On our last 2 visits guys at the bar had a few too many drinks and the f bombs and other curse words along with interesting stories were quite too frequent that it was actually uncomfortable.  Now if I was alone with the guys the stories would have been great but with the 2 little ones with us not so good.  

As I said earlier if you like wings give Uncle Sam's a shot.  If you don't stay away.  Price is great too.  For a small salad, 13 wings, a beer or two you are looking at about $10/meal.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"We loved Uncle Sam's in Scottsdale.  We brought the food all the way to Fountain Hills several times a month.  Sadly, we were shocked to find it closed with a note on the door.  It's just too far to drive over 1/2 hour to pick up carry-out food.   We'll miss you."}
{"text":"Terrible. ...ordered one of the signature cheesessteak sandwiches for pickup. ...I asked for a mushroom with onions extra sweet peppers. ..$20 something dollars later..I get home and unwrapped  a  disaster.  Stale  bread, beef as dry as cardboard,  little to no cheese, oh and don't even ask about the mushrooms and sweet peppers. .None!.....extremely disappointed. ..don't waist your money"}
{"text":"Still a favorite restraunt of mine. Maybe it's because it's a childhood memory but the sause and taste I still can enjoy. I usually give 5 stars to speciality restraunts or inexpensive ones but there food here is great."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place from a friend's referral for having great cheesesteaks.  I called on the phone to place my to go order ahead of time so it would be ready when I got there.  My one single cheesesteak sandwich with onions, mushrooms and red sauce on the side came to almost $20.00 for ONE sandwich!  

Unless it is prepared by the ghost of Elvis, the hand of God, served by Taylor Swift in a whipped cream bikini, or sent immediately by some unknown alien technology straight from Philly I would NEVER pay $20.00 for one sandwich.  BUT I thought okay, I will give it a try based on my friend telling me how great it was.

I had never been to this place before so I asked the girl on the phone if she could tell me if they were located on the North or South side of the street.  This is a simple enough question that I am sure is asked commonly.  HOWEVER, She could not tell me and said that she really did not know the answer.  She asked me if I would like her to ask someone there to find out the answer and I said no.  If you can not simply tell me what side of the street you are located off the top of your head then cancel my order.

I just do not understand the lack of simple, basic, customer service and having a basic working knowledge of the business that employs you these days.  Judging by other reviews I now see here of this establishment it probably worked out for the best that they did not get my business.  

During my days of working if I could not answer simple questions like this I would have been shown the door and told not to let it hit me in my butt on the way out in no uncertain terms.  Just seems like nowadays the more incompetent you are the less it gets corrected with all the political correctness and coddling of people this type of behavior blossoms and becomes commonplace."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service or the pizza.  

I was craving some wings and pizza and we were in the neighborhood. We have been here before because we loveee the wings and I thought we loved the pizza.  So we order a small pizza, wings and an appetizer, which was fried zucchini.  We let our waitress know, Aubrey was her name, that we wanted the appetizer first.
15 minutes roll around and no appetizer! Plus my husband was out of water and she hadn't come around. Finally a different waitress comes out with our order, minus the appetizer.  I mention to her we haven't received it and our waitress shows up just in time to hear this and basically scolds the other waitress helping out, like it was her fault that we didn't get our appetizer.  So we ask for a refill as she leaves, no problem, or at least we thought, 5 minutes into eating their suicide wings (which are by far the hottest hot wings I have ever tasted) my husband is really in need of that water. Finally I see her come around but with no water, she almost makes it to the table when I see that she realizes the same thing and she does a complete 180, and a few minutes later...daa daa!!! Water!!!  Other than the service completely lacking, and the pizza pretty blah, I enjoyed the wings and zucchini.  Unfortunately it did kinda ruin that satisfaction I was going for since after all I was really craving something more than what I got."}
{"text":"We love going to Uncle Sam's for their honey hot bbq wings. They're the best! I also love their onion rings. We've ordered pizza a few times and it's been fine. We were there on 6/17 and ordered the usual. We ordered a pizza and went for a large so we could have leftovers. Well when the pizza came we didn't even touch it bc we were already stuffed with the wings, fries and onion rings. We just boxed the pizza and left. 

See picture below of the atrocity that they gave us for a pizza! It was beyond burnt and the kids wouldn't touch it. I tried a slice and it was dry and tasted horrible.  It's beyond me why a cook wouldn't let an order go out looking this and how could a waitress deliver something is not even edible. 

We will stick to the wings and fries."}
{"text":"There are two Uncle Sam's that I know of (and no, I am not talking about UNCLE SAM as in Big Brother!) and the one on Shea and 32nd street is the best.  I have eaten at the much larger restaurant on Shea and 92nd in Scottsdale, and IMHO, it lacks character.  The service at 32nd street is exceptional, and very, very fast (even when packed).  The food is good, with ample portions.  The only negative is that if you want french fries you have to order them as a side.  I think this is a shame, because while they are tasty -- they simply add a lot of extra $$ to the end of your bill.  Overall, my favorite choice there is the calzone (which has cheese and spinach inside).  I like that I can get a mini calzone and take half of it home and eat it for lunch the next day.  Tip:  go early for best seating.  Large parties are difficult, but they do a good job of seating you in the back.  Crowded at lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam wants me and I want Uncle Sam's!!!! Yuuu-uuum!

The all-american sub is absolutely, by far my favorite sub in the world. The bread is great and it is toasted to absolute perfection. I can't even count how many times I have oredered it and it always comes out the same way and never disappoints! The cheese steak sub is also really good and their pizza and wings are pretty awesome too!!!

I usually get it to go, but if you are planning on stopping in, they always have sporting events on TV which is pretty cool. It's kind of a small dining area, but it's fun if you are in the mood for a sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been going to Uncle Sam's since the 1980's.  The food is yummy - the Uncle Sam's special pizza and the wings are really good.  Normally we get take out.

The 2-star rating is due to the interior of the restaurant and the wait staff.  This place is in dire need of a make-over.  Like I said, 1980's, yet it is EXACTLY the same.  Except the chairs are ripped, there is no music, and everything feels old.  The waitress we had the last two times should be doing something else.  She obviously doesn't enjoy what she's doing.

Please Uncle Sam's - you've got the food.  But you aren't doing anything to attract new customers and improve the experience.  With little competition in the area, you should be the \"go to\" place - yet I have no desire to eat there again.  We'll stick with take out"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and not really impressed.  We recently had a stromboli and a chicken cheesesteak.  I thought we ordered a veggie stromboli, but it had pepperoni in it.  The outside was overdone, and definitely burnt in more than just spots.  The chicken cheesesteak was very non-descript."}
{"text":"This was the 1st time I had a l less than desirable experience here and the Manager went above and beyond to make sure me an my family were happy. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"great philly cheesesteak, hot bbq wings, fries, pizza. Good place to drink that is not a bar."}

TOP REASONS WHY I LOVE THIS PLACE:
-The americana theme
-Best happy hour in the valley
- service is outstanding :) 
 I had a philly yummmyyy
 (: its not a fancy place but it is a place you will be coming back to every week! 
WAY TO GOO UNCLE SAM'S, ITS MORE LIKE I WANT UNCLE SAM'S IN MY HOME KITCHEN !!!"}
{"text":"Philly Cheese, Please!

If you're like me, you're not wearing any pants right now. Also, if you're like me, you have a few places you frequent where the food is good but not perfect, and the service is fine, but not amazing- and yet you still like the place.

That pretty much sums up Uncle Sams. Imperfection meets comfort food and consistency. While UCs is not a first date spot, it's a great place to grab a lunch with a buddy, co-worker, etc. 

I usually get the mushroom cheese  steak, with fried mushroom & zucchini appetizer. I'm not sure who invented beer battering veggies, but I want to hug him/her. Pretty much- if it's fried at UCs, it will taste good!

On my most recent visit, the service was just outstanding. It was weird how good things went, much like going to Target and getting Nordstrom's style service. Drinks were always full, plenty of napkins, etc. It was refreshing because I often dial my expectations down at spots like these, where you're not there to be pampered.

In closing, Uncle Sam's is a good spot. Is it amazing? Nope. Life altering? Uh uhh. But it is good, consistent, and recently had terrific service. Sometimes that's just enough to make for a good outing."}
{"text":"Per the evening news (Channel 3), this Uncle Sam's was raided by the police today for identity theft by the restaurant owner.  It looks like he'll be enjoying jail food for awhile."}
{"text":"Remember coming to this establishment when I was young. Pizza and wings are still as delicious as I can remember. We recently visited this location and the service was great. Nice waitresses and the \"Meat Lovers\" pizza is a must try if you love beef pepperoni ham & bacon! I might be leaving out other meats idk lol ! Great place to go as a family. Small place but the customer satisfaction is there!"}
{"text":"Uncle Sams has really gone downhill. The food is mediocre and service very very slow. Wait Staff and management more interested in chatting or watching the TVs than helping the customers."}
{"text":"This place has bad reviews. But I've never had a problem here. I've been here about 4 times. Each time I get seated right away and I get asked if I want something to drink. The female working are always good looking which is a plus. I order wings with some fries on the side I enjoy them more than going to buffalo wild wings. They are fast and hot always. This place is a good spot also a good place to watch some sport games. It is too dark inside this spot and it's kinda dirty."}
{"text":"Love Uncle SAMs. We were hungry and kind of lost in Peoria. All we wanted was to eat. Thank goodness we found Uncle SAMs. Even though it was close to closing they gave great service and food.  Manager was very on top of every thing and the place was nice and clean. Our server Kayla was fantastic and very friendly. Place was a little busy, but you gotta love a place you pay 35ish for good food and get fine dinning service. Thank you Uncle SAMs for coming to our food rescue when we were lost in Peoria Az. You can always trust uncle SAMs. 
Thanks again Kayla our server for getting us back on track back to Maricopa city. Az."}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order of a calzone and an order of suicide wings.   Ordered the regular calzone.  It seemed small to me for the price.  The bread was soggy and the ingredients didn't do anything for me.  The wings were spicy and had a good flavor but they were on the fat side and could have been cooked longer to crisp them up a bit.

I've been to other Uncle Sams in the past and this one is on par with the rest.  Typical chain bar food that is over priced and under delivers.  When I want wings I want them done right and when I want a calzone I want it to ooze with cheese and have a crisp crust with a chewy center and a nice sauce inside.  

After a couple wings and a couple slices of the calzone I nodded my head remembering why I don't come here.  A coworker was recently recommending them to me so I thought I'd give this one a shot.  Maybe if I had a few beers I would enjoy it more."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Whenever we are in the north side of town we always make it a point to drop by.  Very extensive menu, but they don't even need it because the cheese steaks are the best!! 

Very friendly service!  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I gave this 2 stars because of a very sweet competent new waitress who had to put up with bad food.  I have been going to Uncle Sams for many years.  Since they sold in Scottsdale there has been a major deteriation in quality especially on 32nd and Shea.  We went to dinner there last night and it was horrible.  First we ordered the zucchini and it was painfully obvious that the food was fried twice because the reulting food we received was FAR over cooked and hard a s rock.  Naturally we sent it back for a re-do.  Then my wifes chicken philly was COLD and dry.  Well she sent it back and it came back and it had been pre-cooked also.  She ate 20% of it.  My pizza seemed to be diferrent than the old days.  Its obvious they are using pre made crusts.  I asked if the bacon was pre- cooked and of course they said yes, well it was 70% raw.  I could count the artichokes on one hand and were thinner han paper.  I ate 1/2 of a10\" pizza.  Oh the waitress forgot to ask if we wanted refills on drinks but she was new so thats ok.  The water was fine as was the seltzer water.  Need I say more.  We need a real Philly steak sub shop in the area.  
Sorry Uncle Sams your time has come and gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my old time favorites after coming out here in the late 80's. Very friendly service. Great sandwiches, pizza, wings and other yummies. You can see the open kitchen when you enter. Nice!

We start with a baker's dozen of honey BBQ wings with a side of suicide sauce. I like the Italian grinder with sweet peppers and the wife gets the cheese steak with green peppers and onion.

Can get a little noisy when really busy. Several TVs on the wall to watch sports. Try to get there early for lunch or at off peak hours and request to sit up front in a booth."}
{"text":"The first time I went to uncle sams, I was attending the one on 83rd and union hills with my family. I had Taylor as a server the first time, and she was awesome and provided excellent service and showed a great personality, and of course the food was awesome too!!! I've also went in recently and had Trisha as my server and she also provided a bubbly personality and great service, always made sure we were happy and had what we needed! 

I did want to tell a manager both times about how excellent my service had been, but both managers I had seen seemed too busy on their phones to talk to anyone else. 

Great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the early 90s and it just seems to be getting worse snotty attitudes abound sub par service and when I finally got my $16.00 Cheese Steak it was one foot of non edtibal gristle !   Adding the pic they have gone so far down hill not sure if they can come back ... too bad it used to be good."}
{"text":"I recently was there and purchased a six foot sub for my son's 16th birthday. And needless to say the bread was as hard as a rock and we couldn't even it it. The bread could have been used as a weapon. And when calling back to reference the problem the manager would only give us 10 off our next order. And the sub was 60 dollars what the heck is that. They have should given us at least half. That is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of all American food. Grinders, fried favorites, salads, ice cream, etc!"}
{"text":"I just got a to go calzone to bring it home and find canned, sour mushrooms in it. It is absolutely mind boggling to me that a restaurant uses canned mushrooms for anything these days, especially as a topping for pizza, calzones, etc. Nothing appetizing whatsoever about this. Plus, my immediate thought after is \"what else are you trying to save a penny on?\" Take pride in your food. You're a restaurant. Its ALL YOU HAVE."}
{"text":"ONLY GO IF YOU ARE HUNGRY! We just moved to the area and were intrigued by the sign & the fact the place always seemed packed. Plus we have an affinity for locally owned joints. I ran into to get a couple of cheese steaks one day for lunch...the \"WHOLE\" cheese steak is like a loaf of bread. Totally worth it, but we ate them for like 3 meals. Very very good. 

So decided to dine in the next time. The large pizza is plenty...really. The wings are above average. We will order them again, but not the best I have ever had. Beer is cold & the soda refills just keep coming. Lots of people having a good time both times we have stopped by so far. 

Staff was very friendly & very efficient. They move you in & out quickly.  It is a bit pricery than I expected, but good food & great service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experience in service.  It took over 10 mins to get a large order of mozzarella sticks only to get a small.

{"text":"I remember going to the Scottsdale location a couple years ago; the food was great and the service was fantastic.  The Scottsdale location has since closed so we decided to go to this location.  We had a table of twelve and we were splitting the check 3 ways.  We put our order in, explained the separate checks and waited for our food. Once we got our food, we found our waitress did not get the order right.  She looked a little flustered so we explained what needed to be corrected.   She corrected the meal orders and we ate.  Then we received our bill and realized it was all mixed up.  We explained the problem to her and she could not get the billing right.  She brought me three different bills and insisted I pay.  I tried explaining that I was being billed for way less and it was not correct.  Once I got the 3rd bill, I accepted the fact that she had no idea what we ordered and decided to pay the bill.  After I paid, the manager came back and said he would correct the billing and that he voided my payment (seen in picture).  I read the check and voided payment slip and realized that someone there called me an asshole on my tab.  I was very upset because that could not be further from the truth.  I was kind to the waitress, I tried correcting my tab so she would not get in trouble for under billing me and nevertheless I'm the asshole.  I asked the manager who did this and he crinkled the bill with his fist and said dinner was on the house.  No apology and no explanation.  This establishment has very rude employees and a rude manager.  Terrible Service From Rude & Incompetent People!"}
{"text":"If you're 16 this will probably be right up your alley.  The servers are all young, cute girls but haven't properly been trained.  I went here with friends and ordered a couple of cheese steaks and grilled chicken salad,  both of our steaks were cold by the time they arrived and the chicken was raw.  We told the waitress and she said...oh I'm sorry but that was it.  I don't think the kitchen staff cares what they turn out because they are chasing the girls.  It's gone down hill lately and it's sad because I live in the neighborhood.  I won't go back."}

{"text":"Ok Uncle Sam's , I have given you guys dozens of chances over the past three decades to get your act together, but today hit a new low. I called in an order and you actually charged me for hot and sweet peppers. Since when did you start charging for peppers????? Secondly, you gave me a cheese steak that was 50% gristle. Who does that?? Thirdly, you advertise that you put grill spice on the fries, I asked for this so called grill spice to try out, but no grill spice. Uncle Sam's I hate to say this, but this is it. We are broken up. That is the last $25 you get from this guy. I'd say we had a nice run, but we haven't. Your store on Shea is garbage and your store that was in North Scottsdale was horrible, too. Goodbye Uncle Sam's it was nice knowing you. Hoping they put a Portillo's in your spot when this location closes, too."}

{"text":"Do not come here! Ordered wings and pizza which took a hour. After we were told the kitchen was really slow. During this time the restaurant was no busy at all. When our food finally came the salad was warm and the wings were cold. I sent the wings back. The manager came out said that they were going to make a new set of wings for us. At this point we were so disappointed with the quality of service and food we just wanted to leave. Our waitress came over and explained that she didn't know what the kitchens problem was today. Making it seem like there was an issue between servers and the cooks. Which increased the our desire to just leave. I asked for us to get the bill. The bill was not correctly divided. I was still charged for the wings. At this point I just payed for the wings so we didn't have to stay there any longer. My 3 year old daughter ordered Yoo-hoo drink. Said her stomach started to hurt after drinking half of her drink. She was sick the next day. I don't see how a business can be successful when customers pay for food they sent back."}
{"text":"Would be a 5 star if they brought Siad back. When he ran it, it was clean, fast and the waitresses looked like they could work anywhere. Not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Open your mouth and say hello to my brand new favorite pizza.

I've been going to Uncle Sam's at least once a week lately. Sometimes I get the wings. Sometimes I get a cheese steak. Sometimes I get pizza. Thanks to the bailout menu, sometimes I just go ahead and get all three.

Five stars for the friendly staff and the Ms. Pac-Man machine in the lobby."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is pretty cool! I had the personal pizza and thought it was very good. The people I was with told me that the hoagies were really tasty, too. The employees were nice. The reason they do not get 5 stars from me is because it took quite some time for our food to come out. I know that pizza can take a while but this wait was longer than just a pizza, especially since there wasn't a crowd. Despite that, I intend to return in the future!"}
{"text":"We use to love the Uncle Sam's in Scottsdale, however the one on 32nd st in Phoenix leaves a lot to be desired. We went last night and the service was awful. The food was made incorrectly, the waitress never came over to refill drinks. We ordered a pizza when we explained it came wrong she stood there holding the pizza saying Ummm... She didn't offer to remake it just stood there. On top of that she had an attitude when told her the food was prepared incorrectly like it was our fault they made it wrong, when we asked for drink refills apparently it was too much trouble. But she did get pleasant when she dropped the check off! Unfortunately, it was too late. It is too expensive to eat here for the type of service we received. Fast food would have been better!"}
{"text":"Walked in with my hungry, thirsty children. Waited in lobby for a hostess to seat us for 7 min. Mind you, there was no one waiting other than us. When we finally do get seated, we waited for another 10 min. We finally decide to leave when the server says 'oh, your leaving.' When I said \"yes, we are, you took too long.\" She replied \"well I was over there arguring..\" I didn't even let her finish, because that's exactly what we wanted to hear."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 30 years and will continue to do so. For some reason that even the managers can not really explain, they have switched their bread supplier and then bread is now dry and falls apart. Get with it guys, it cant be that hard to find someone who can make decent bread."}
{"text":"After my Girlfriend's Daughter got out of her nearby Gymnastics class on Saturday, we went to Uncle Sam's for lunch.  I had just flew in from California and none of us had eaten yet.  My Girlfriend and her Daughter had been there before, but this was my first time.  In short, it's a local place to definitely visit and go for a drink or meal!

The customer service was great!  The place was clean and wasn't to crowded!  

I had a individual pizza, and my Girlfriend and I shared a antipasto salad.  The pizza was like old school, don't think about your diet, a good greasy pizza!  The salad was more than enough, and we even took some home.

All in all, great for a couple or to take the family.  I liked this place and would recommend it to anyone visiting or local!"}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb we had the wings pizza and Ceaser salad and all of was amazing and tasted fresh and made from scratch"}
{"text":"Had a wedding rehearsal dinner at Uncle Sams 83rd Ave. store last night.  Requested reservations which were accepted.  Everything was setup when we arrived with about 20 people.  Two servers were designated and did an outstanding job.  No complaints from anyone.  Beers were icee cold and food was hot and well prepared.  Food and drink selection is great.  Happy hour prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Uncle Sam on 32nd St and Shea for over 20 yrs. Always been a favorite, my boys as young children enjoyed the pizza and now as adults still act like kids when it came to Uncle Sam's pizza. Recently we moved to Peoria and were excited to find out that we had an Uncle Sam appx 5 mins away. Well tonight we finally had a chance to try them out. OMG what a disappointment. If I didn't know better I would never have thought it was an Uncle Sam. We ordered 3 steak sandwiches a large order of fries and a large order of onion rings to go. I get there to pick up my order and I looked at the onion rings and it was a tiny amount, usually we take left over when we get the large so I questioned it and quickly they said oh we can add more so I waited for more then I noticed the fries too. The waitress told me that was the large like I didn't know better. Mc Donalds large is double this order and it doesn't cost $5.95. She said I can speak to the manager but she couldn't find him. I get home and the sandwiches were cold, tasted terrible as if they took cold cut roast beef and turned it to steak sandwiches, couldn't see or taste the onions, mushrooms or grilled tomatoes which we ordered extra and to top it all I'm about at the end of my sandwich and I get a hair in it. I will never go to the Union Hill's location again. We will make the drive to the Phoenix location when we want Uncle Sam. Shame on you Union Hills location, shame on you."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a top of the line joint with amazing chef's quality food keep looking... but if you're looking for laid back easy going place with mediocre food and halfway decent looking broads with a few hard city miles to serve it too you then this is the spot. Now listen these ladies have no business as real servers and would never make it at a corporately onwed company restaurant but at a place like this where service is 2nd and food quality is 3rd they do ok. If you go to this location sit in Jackie's section. She is fairly dickable and comes off like you might have a shot. IDK if you really would but she lets you think you would probably for tips sake. I ate there yesterday 7/22 around lunch time. I had the 10\" pizza with onions ham bell peppers and sausage.  My lady friend had the 7\" pepperoni.  Both were pretty \"meh\". Next time I'll try the wings. I hear they are better..."}
{"text":"This my family and I's go-to spot when we need fast, good food. The waitresses (yes, they are all chicks) are always very nice and on top of it, which in sports bars really is a toss up. Good food, fast service, nice staff - good place to go."}
{"text":"Very good for what it is- cheap, tasty bar food. Everything on the menu is fried and/or covered in cheese. I like to wash it down with a $5 pitcher of Blue Moon during happy hour, kick back, and wait for the inevtiable stomach cramps to arrive. It's a good pain."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's has a pretty good happy hour.  Be advised that bottle beers are not on Happy Hour.  What is nice about them, they have a little of practically everything.  They have sandwiches, pizza, burgers, etc.  They have 6 beers on tap, one of which is Fat Tire.  The servers are usually pleasant and we get fast service.  It doesn't get too busy here."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now, both times came away disappointed. Ordered a chicken sandwich the first time, it was the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had, and the service was extremely slow. Gave the place a second chance tonight, thinking that the first time was an anomaly, but my Hawaiian Calzone was barely luke warm, and consisted mostly of bread and pizza sauce, hardly any ham or pineapple. And, the service was extremely slow again. My daughter's chicken sandwich was just a chicken strip with some pizza sauce on a large hoagie role. She the chicken off the role and ate it by itself. We ordered an appetizer and they didn't bring it until they brought the main meals. I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I just felt compelled to warn people to not go here, especially if they want to get in and out in less than two hours."}
{"text":"Went here after a morning of Ultimate Frisbee for some pizza and to cool off...

It wasn't bad.  I really haven't been here enough to make a big deal about what was there, but it seemed okay with me, but not enough for me to say \"Hey, let's go to Uncle Sam's!\"

Pizza was pretty good.  Some guys at my table got some fries, but the fries looked like something I could have bought at Costco.

Another thing that kind of bites is that they charge for ranch.  I had a ranch-a-holic at my table and he was pretty bummed that they charged."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's used to be great. The best cheesesteak or sub. Great fries and wings. Those days are gone. It is hit and miss each time now. We hit Uncle Sam when nothing else sounds good either so about 2x per year. Today was that day. I regret it.  I ordered the mushroom pepper cheese steak with grilled onions and sweet peppers.  Over half of the steak in the sandwich was in-chewable gristle. About half of the normal amount of cheese. Zero on the mushrooms. Literally one bell pepper and they must have forgotten the grilled onions. I did however get 5 pieces of sweet pepper. 
We ordered a large basket of fries to split....  I hate re-fried fries. All 14 of them were that way. I'm sure I will be back at some point holding out hope. There is a reason we walked in at 12:10pm and this sandwich institution was less than half filled.  
I wish he would sell it to me- make uncle sams great again!"}
{"text":"This is one of our great neighborhood hang outs.  What I love:  their wings! the zucchini sticks!!  the pizza (lots of variety).  They will accommodate lo-carb, but definitely not the place to eat if you're counting calories.  My kiddo loves the turkey hoagie, chicken caesar salad, and of course the cheese pizza.  The happy hour drink specials are awesome - HH until 7pm and then starts again at 9.  The place is huge and can fit a lot of customers, which is nice because you rarely have to wait to be seated even when they are full.  Overall the service is great - they have a lot of servers and they are always super nice."}
{"text":"So, Uncle Sam's is gone.  Too bad, because the food wasn't that bad.

But in life, as they say: \"As one door closes, another one opens.\"  See below:

\"Portillo's, a much-loved Chicago-area restaurant that specializes in Italian beef and hot dogs, is moving ahead with plans to open its first Arizona locations in Scottsdale and Tempe.

\"Company spokeswoman Patty Sullivan said Portillo's is in the permitting process with Scottsdale for plans to open a location near 90th Street and Shea Blvd. in February. [Reported in AZBEX June 1st]

\"Portillo's also plans to submit permitting papers shortly for a location at Tempe Marketplace, near the Loop 202 and McClintock Drive. Sullivan said the company hopes to open there in August of next year.

\"We are continuing to look for areas in Chandler,\" Sullivan said.

\"Portillo's specializes in Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian beef, but also offers made-to-order salads, burgers, cheese fries, desserts and beer.

\"Company founder Dick Portillo said in January that each of the new restaurants would be at least 7,000 square feet and must have a drive-through and ample parking. The new locations would be built, as opposed to moving into existing space


\"This is the first of four restaurants planned by Portillo's for the Arizona market\"

Wow, four Portillo's in AZ.  Nice!"}
{"text":"We eat here several times per year. We each ordered steak sandwiches and some appetizers. The appetizers (fries, mushrooms, & onion rings) were very good. However, the steak sandwiches were a REAL problem. The meat was overcooked (therefore dry) on both sandwiches. The bread was wrong and not toasted on one although wheat bread was emphasized during the order process. There was VERY little cheese on the other. Oh well . . .  We did not complain, although we probably should have. At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon restaurant you can see the filmy grease everywhere and smell it as soon as you walk in. Manager seem to not care what you think it's business as usual! Lol so narcissistic they don't realize it!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord!!! Did you try the cheese steak??? No??  Then slap yourself and take ur dumbass back to uncle SAMs and get it!!!   Knocked my socks off.  And well the hot chicks in short shorts didn't hurt. But yeaaa get that cheese steak!!!!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and eat at Uncle Sam's a couple of times a month. The food that I order, hoagies, grinders,and cheesesteaks easily get five stars. Here they are : *****.

What takes them down two stars is the service. The waitstaff are by and large young and inexperienced, but not bad. What I'm pissed off about is that the management that seems to have no problem berating and belittling the servers and hosts in front of customers. I've complained, but the management seem to all be related to each other. 

Chicken wings are good, not great. The have decent salads and a big selection of beers. Uncle Sam's runs great specials, too. 

I don't love the pizza sauce, so I never get a pizza, stromboli, nor calzones. Other folks that I know seem love these items, so it must just be me. 

Try it out."}
{"text":"The husband and I went there last night around 8 for a date. The food was average and the pizza was the size of my hand for 5$. Not to mention we waited about 15 minutes for our check to be delivered. It's not really a family environment, especially since the waitresses were acting like bimbos towards the drunk guys at the bar. Never again for a date. Try some place less expensive with a quieter environment. I even watched  a guy walk out with his kids because there was so much swearing!"}
{"text":"OMG! this place is so delicious, reviewing it now just makes me wanna go eat their COMBO (Zucchini & Mushroom) w/Ranch=$ 5.25. When i was there, I had the wings in HONEY HOT BBQ (6) =$ 3.99 as well. Someone at our table had a cheese steak, but i didn't taste it; however i did taste a french fry and it was perfect, not greasy. the service was fast and pleasant. i can't believe the quality of the food for the prices. food is fast and fresh! i can't wait to go back! its always busy around sporting time....so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Philly cheesesteak I've ever had it was so Bland there was no flavor in the meat there is no juice it was dry it was just a nasty Philly cheese steak my recommendation is go to Corleone's"}
{"text":"This place is great for people coming from out of town. The whole restaurant is a gimic with pro USA artifacts and funny posters. It has a true sports bar feel. This place also serves Yoohoo! the chocolate drink on its menu too. The pizza is so so at best. If you get larger then an individual pizza or put too many toppings on it, the thing wont come out right. The \"bail out menu\" has some good deals that will save you some money. Its a friendly place for kids. I really like the garlic bread baskets of all things because they come with good marinara dipping sauce. ."}
{"text":"I went to Uncle Sams on 83rd Street yesterday because one of my friends in my bicycle club recommended it and actually, I had been wanting to check it out for a while anyway so when my daughter was in town from California, we stopped in for lunch.  

It's hard to figure out what this place is trying to be - a sports bar?, a family restaurant? a deli?  A pizza joint? I just figure that one out.  

We were there at about straight up noon so you would think it would be pretty busy but there were only about 12  tables out of about 50 occupied, about half just adults, about half with kids (one kid was pitching a fit so that was a bit distracting).

I had a cheese steak sandwich and my daughter had a ham & turkey sandwich, both with fries.  I would give the food a 5 / 10 score.  (OK but nothing special).  You do get plenty to eat so you will not leave hungry but you will leave feeling a little bit dissatisfied about the quality of the food.  I'm not sure what the sandwiches needed but I felt my steak and cheese was a little bland.  The fries were pretty excellent.

Service was a 2 out of 10.  Slow, no follow up to check on the food or drinks - she only came to the table to take our order, deliver the food and then to deliver our check - that's it.  

Will I go back?  Doubt it.  Would I recommend Uncle Sams to my friends?  No.  There are just too many other places in town that offer better food, better service and there are places that seem to really want you to come back - this place didn't seem to offer anything stellar at all."}
{"text":"So after staying away for nearly a year due to the sad gradual decline of the place we decided to give it another shot.  I guess as a kid who grew up with their delicious pizza and cheesesteaks I just couldn't abandon them and stay away forever!  Have to say, after one visit back they are well on their way to winning us back.  Service was prompt, friendly, and much more of the All American high school vibe I remember than the kind of trashy strung out stripper types they've had working there over the past several years.  But on to the important stuff, the food!  We ordered a half cheesesteak, sams special pizza, zucchini, and chicken fingers for the kid.  Healthy I know!  The food was like I remember it, prompt, fresh, hot and delicious.  My only complaint is a familiar one, they need to put more cheese on the cheesesteaks!  But other than that it was a lot more like the \"good old days\" at Uncle Sams that I remember.  We'll be back and let's hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the positive reviews are for, I went here the other day and was not the least bit impressed. I heard good things about their cheesesteaks, and since I have never had a cheesesteak before I thought I'd try them out. There wasn't much meat in the sandwich, and it lacked cheese. I told them no onions and yet onions were still sprinkled throughout the sandwich.

Even their salad was terrible, the ranch was runny and it didn't even have any croutons on it. The prices were kind of high and the place was extremely dirty. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I think it is a bit pricey for a super casual family restaurant.  The kids meals are like $6 each!  Also, as a vegetarian that doesn't care much for pizza the choice was EXTREMELY limited.  I had a dinner salad and a cheese hoagie.  Would much rather eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst service experiences that I have ever had. We were never even offered a refill on our drinks! Ordered appetizers that were delivered 20 minutes after dinner which was delivered after waiting 45 minutes! I had to ask the waitress if she wanted me to carry  the leftover pizza out with my hands because she never even offered a box for leftovers. We have been here with our kids several times in the past and will NEVER be back. Seems like this place really has gone down hill in both quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Really like that mushroom cheese steak sandwich."}
{"text":"I went there one time, ordered a small pizza for 9 dollars.
Small pizza.  If I spend 9 dollars, I feel I should get enough food to keep me from being hungry.  I medium cost 17 dollars, so I didn't want to pay that much.
The pizza was made with bad dough.  The dough tasted like it was old or something.
Just about the worst pizza I have had in a long time.
Nothing else to say because I did not stay and had my pizza to go.  Looks OK inside.
I do not recommend this pizza.  To small for the price and bad tasting."}
{"text":"1st day for Cardinal football.  Thought this would be perfect. They raised beer prices by a quarter big deal. But the bad part is no sound for the cardinals game and they kept the juke box going.  We complained about it and they said to bad but the Dallas game that night we could listen to it.  Last year the girls could wear jerseys during football but not this year.  Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"I go there several times a week and I rarely have a problem.  I think I have had pretty much everything on the menu over the past 8 years and its all good.  Thanks Gloria, Lance, and Derek for the great service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love & miss this place!  I always order the Philly steak subs and sometimes order the wings. I brought my parents here one day and they loved it. The sandwiches are huge and are pretty pricey but I'd definitely pay 15 dollars for a full size sub here."}
{"text":"got a pizza....definitely not worth the 20$$$ tasted like little ceasers!!!!  will never go there again!!!!! if i want crappy pizza i will go pay 5 bucks!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love pizza and thought we might give Uncle Sam's a try since they claimed they had the freshest ingredients.  The pizza wasn't too bad, except for the CANNED MUSHROOMS!!!!  Are you able to claim fresh if the mushrooms were canned the day before??  Really?  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Been customer for years, got home with my white 3 meat large pizza and wings! Wow wings always good and as expected for my 25 honey hots!  But my 3 meat white pizza was missing meat!  Every edge and  2 in from the edge had no stinking meat? I'm like what went wrong when I got home! 
We should have called but what's the point
When I have super hungry people, so next time I have to check it I guess!"}
{"text":"Kitschy and dive-y, it's a fun place.  Been there three times and really like it. Hearty portions, house made salad dressings, beer is ice col, good service ( our server today, Tavia, was efficient, courteous and charming). Could be darn near perfect if they had pesto as a pizza option and blue cheese dressing. 
Sometimes kitchen is a bit inconsistent (Italian dressing was heavy on seasonings and vinegar once, second time tasty, shrimp salad had mayo once, not second time).   But worth the visit a few times for a better feel for it."}
{"text":"I grew up in this neighborhood but didn't really discover Uncky Sam's until I was ready to go away to college 35 years ago. I'm 85 years old and my taste buds have over the years been replaced with the desire for the youth I once took for granted. But if there's one culinary recollection that brings a little flutter to this old man's heart it's the phantom taste of a Cheese Hoagie, that phallic masterpiece of untold proportions from Uncle Sam's.
 
It's huge. 

They don't let me drive anymore but once in a while I want to jump in a cab and order one for old time's sake with with an extra side of the hoagie dressing. And eat it over the course of six days. It's that good. And that big. The hoagies are cold. The grinders are hot. The ingredients are slightly different for each but good god is this place good. The fountain drinks taste like they are mixed with really gross water but I gladly put up with it because the sandwiches are soooooo good. I've never really ordered anything else and can't speak to the rest of their menu but if you want a really really really good sub try Uncle Sam's."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to eat during quiet times, when there is no popular sporting event taking place on TV. They have excellent sandwiches that are very large. Roast Beef, Corned Beef, and Pastrami are all excellent. They also have the best fried zucchini I have eaten.

The service is generally good, but not excellent. It is sometimes difficult to procure a drink refill.

Coupons are regularly available."}
{"text":"Have been ordering here many times.  Most of the time our orders are wrong.  This is the last time we will ever order from here.  Sandwiches have gotten VERY small!  We ordered double meat and cheese which we questioned when we got the order.  There was not double anything!!!!  Very small sandwich.  I would hate to see what it would look like without double. Half sandwich cost $13 maybe 8\"."}
{"text":"This is the second I have literally been disgusted by the service and food this place. I told myself I would not be back again. My girlfriend invited me out to be with her family. Everyone's order was wrong. All the food was cold. I sent mine back wasn't even what I ordered. The manager was rude and patronizing when we ask to be satisfied with the bill. He was very unaccommodating, and unwilling to work with us. This place is just awful. I will be contacting management about this incident and will never return."}
{"text":"Love the food. The staff is great, too. Has kind of an old, local biker bar-ish feel. Pricing is proportionate to the servings... so a large sandwich is huge. Two large sandwiches feeds 5 of us, and we'll still have leftovers."}
{"text":"Where to begin; I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. The server was very cute and young, but didn't listen to anything we asked for. Wanted salads first, they came at the same time as everything else. Wanted full sandwiches, got halves. Asked if the onion rings were better than the fries?  She said they were - but they were not. After the rush was over, I noticed a bunch of older men emerge from the back of the house to catch the scores from the nights sports slate. Seems like the managers only sit at the bar or mill around the kitchen flirting with the very young all-female waitstaff. So if you like so-so service and mediocre food while watching a bizarre display of small, blurry out-of-position TVs and a staff with very little supervision, then this is the place for you. A shame too because this place has potential."}
{"text":"Awful basic bar good at best.. service is just the same, sparce.. I'm guessing he's the manager,  bald guy never got his name but rude as f*ck.. save your money and spend it at an establishment that'll actually care about your business!"}
{"text":"Used to be hopping on a Friday night but is dead at 7:30. Poor service, four servers walked past me as I sat at the bar without saying boo! Finally one said \"need something? \" Uh a beer would be nice, that's why I'm at the bar."}
{"text":"Someone, from Philadelphia mind you, told me the cheesesteak at Uncle Sam's is better than anything he had ever had in Philly.  It wasn't.  It was incredibly mediocre, dry, and flavorless.

The honey wings were pretty good, but aside from that this place sucks.  Oh hey look, another generic sports bar type place in a strip mall in Arizona.

Pass."}
{"text":"Been eating here since I was a kid apprx. 30 years. Undercooked wings have me being no further than 15 ft from a bathroom. Never again."}
{"text":"I legitimately will never give this place another try again. 

The first time we came here (boyfriend and I) we ordered a pizza, mozzarella sticks, and french fries. In the meantime, a waitress was bussing the table behind us and was extremely loud talking to another employee. And when I say loud, I mean LOUD. But that's not what bothered me. What bothered me is what she said... \"WOW! I didn't think they were going to tip me that much because they were black!\" Referring to the family at the table that had just left.  This is absolutely unacceptable, and I don't care what age, race, or what establishment you work in. Advice to the owners/managers- don't hire ignorant staff! Aside from that the food was just okay. Pizza was comparable to something that comes out of a frozen-food box, mozzarella sticks came out luke-warm (meaning the cheese was hard) and french fries were comparable to what you get in a grade-school cafeteria. 

Second time we were here we came for what we thought would be a quick lunch. Serivce was so absolutely slow an incompetent. I ordered a garden salad (or whatever version of that is the small version) and the lettuce came out soggy and there was water at the bottom of the salad bowl. Talk about unappetizing. The whole meal service took nearly an hour and twenty minutes. So much for a quick lunch.. '

The third and last time I came here, I came with the idea that maybe \"the third time's a charm.\" Boy was I wrong. I ordered the dinner Ceasar salad, boyfriend ordered a small 7\" pizza with buffalo sauce instead of marinara, and we shared a side of fries. 
My salad came out with the most unappetizing lettuce I have ever eaten in my life. The lettuce was wilted and nearly rotten, and seemed as if the romaine was cut in half (referencing the large pieces of lettuce). His pizza came out with barbeque sauce instead of buffalo. The waitress took it back, but when she did she took the tray and poked and prodded her fingers around the pizza to ensure that it was barbecue and not buffalo. Regardless of the fact that we didn't eat it that's still disgusting. 

Aside from the terrible food and service, this place is dirty (and by dirty that's a compliment) and dingy and is nothing impressive to look at. No, I will not give this place another try. Sorry, Uncle Sam's."}
{"text":"A classic from my high school days.  This is where I first had a cheesesteak and it has probably influenced/corrupted what I think they should take like immutably.  

The fries are also very good, always crispy never greasy. 

Just be forewarned this place tends to get swarmed by high schoolers during the week."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service today was actually good but now that I actually look around the place, I don't know if I could ever come back. Anyone that has Philadelphia Eagle crap all over obviously knows nothing about football and is not worthy of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and I doubt I will ever return. Beer prices are outstanding, but their calzones are horrible.  The sauce tasted like pico de gallo, by far the worse calzones I have ever had. The wife had the Stromboli and she said that her's was just as bad. I would recommend this place just for the cheap beer but stay away from those 2 items."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a little slice of Americana. The decor is cheesy sports bar (what did you expect?). The Philly steaks are very good. The chicken Philly is also good. I think the pizza is slightly above average. One thing you can say about this place is that you do not have to ask for extra dressing or condiments like at other bar food places (IE blue cheese for the wings, marinara for the mozz sticks) they give you plenty. The ice cold $3 pitcher of beer...c'mon, who can shake their head at that? Contrary to other folks who rated the service as spotty, I have had nothing but great service unless its slammed and then I know to come in with a little more patience (as you would anywhere). I like this place and visit at least once a month."}
{"text":"Never never never eat at this Uncle Sams location, they are infested with roaches!! We were sitting there done with our dinner and 2 roaches crawled out of the wood panel, over the booth, before squeezing into another piece of the wood paneling.  Freaking nasty!

I talked the waitress, who pretended to be \"surprised\" by this incident. She offered to box up my food... NO THANK YOU and give us the bill.

I asked her when she was going to talk to the manager about it, she said that she was going to mention it.

Imagine what their kitchen is like, if there are roaches crawling in the common area! 

I will be calling the health department ASAP to file a report!  

DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour prices and everything fried you can imagine. Except animal testicles, they don't have those. :("}
{"text":"I really hate writing this review.  I have grown up in this neighborhood and have been eating at uncle sam's my whole life.  I have always enjoyed eating and having good times at uncle Sam's.  This last time I was there was a total disappointment.

     To start the waitress could not get are drinks right and took three times to get the order right.  Then when I asked her to bring  table water, she went on to insist that the others did not need water.  Usually I would not make a big deal of this but when everyone at the table is drinking beer I think it is responsibility of the waitress to bring the water to the table regardless. 

     She then proceed to call the manager over to confront me of asking her to bring the water over.  I almost felt as I was getting imitated  but for the fact that he was not responsive with his own questions.  

      Never the-less if  are looking for poor service and a lack of management; uncle sam's on 32'nd and Shea is the place to go."}
{"text":"Placed to go order over the phone. Girl was extremely nice and friendly over the phone. When we arrived time promised food was not ready yet. We got 2 full cheese stakes 1 cheese stakes with extra cheese and hot peppers on the side. 1 with onion and mushrooms sweet peppers on side. Issues both had peppers mixed in with meat and it seemed not to have much cheese. Meat had a lot of gristle. Fries were really good 5 stairs for service and fries 2 for cheese stakes."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and never had any issues. The food is great and so is the service. I have no clue what everyone else is bi-&$:@g about.    I don't work here or have any ties to this place, I just like it. MLB Ticket would be nice though! Kaeli, make it happen! Kaeli provided awesome service!"}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is my favorite local eatery.  My little one loves the pizza and fries and I am a fan of the Philly cheese steak which is by far the best in town (I have been to South Street in Philly several times and can compare!)

The wings and hoagies are also great.

The only reason I gave it a four star and not a five is the salads are overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm really trying to figure out why there are so many negative remarks about this establishment. I've really had no issues with the food or anything when we have visited. Everybody that works there has been incredibly friendly the food has been good the beer could be a little less expensive. We will visit from time to time, hopefully from the lack of a parking lot being full this place stays open."}
{"text":"The food was excellent tonight, the steak sandwich was superb as always ... I highly recommend Christina as a waitress - she was polite and efficient and funny. She deserves a raise - quite possibly the best service we've ever had in our at least 50 visits to Sam's"}
{"text":"I love Uncle Sam's! I graduated from Shadow Mountain High School in 2004 so all through high school after all the sports games we would go. My family has been going here for decades and still order take out often. I think the food is consistent and delicious. This place has something for everyone. It's not the healthiest but it's good. Perfectly greased and cooked each time. I have to get a side of fries every time THEY'RE CRINKLE CUT!!!!! I'm happy they added no less wings to the menu (honey hot of course!!). Pizza is yummy but the grinders and sandwiches and cheesesteaks are where it's at. Anyway, I love Uncle Sam's and my family does too."}
{"text":"We always go to Uncle Sam's for cheesesteaks.  Last night we went there with a few friends.  The cheesesteaks were good but the service was horrible.  Maybe it was our server's first day in a restaurant.  She took our appetizer order (wings) and walked away without asking us about ordering the main entrees.  When the wings appeared, we had to ask for plates, silverware, and napkins...and more napkins since wings are pretty messy.  After that, we had to suggest to her that she take our order.  When the main entrees arrived, we had to again suggest to her that the used plates, wing basket, and used napkins be cleared from the table so we had some room for our meals. We needed ketchup for the fries so my friend grabbed a bottle from one of the other tables.  
I'll be back to Uncle Sam's because I like their food but if I get the same server, I will walk out."}
{"text":"I had just recently taken Uncle Sam's off \"Secret Double Probation\" for an incident during last Thanksgiving week when the waitress disappeared for about 10 minutes because she was on break. On break, wtf? Take a break when you leave work, do you want to earn tips or not?

But lately I found myself going to Uncle Sam's a lot when the Blackhawks were on their way to winning the Stanley Cup. My opinion has turned aroung 180 degrees. The wait staff that I have had this spring has been great, for example, the waitress had the kitchen put all the Pizza ingredients underneath the cheese (Chicago Style) instead of on top of the cheese (NY Style). Not the world's greatest pizza, but it tasted ok. I love the Chicken Parmasean sandwich which fits perfectly on the bread without spilling over, and it's covered in this sweet marinara sauce which makes it delicious. I enjoy their Calzones as well. But who can beat one dollar very cold and refreshing Amber Bocks during happy hour?"}
{"text":"This place is absolute garbage, had some friends in from out of town and all they wanted to do is go here. Haven't been in here in years and always remember it to be really good. So we order our food and the cheese steaks were dry and cold, not to mention the fact I bit into a bone on the second bite so I was done with that. My wings
were not any better, they were black on the inside with lots of veins, just gross, frys were cold, service was awful. Typicall teenager not interested in working. We asked for a manager and she came over and we told her about the food and she did take off the cheese steak but not the wings because I ate the 5 that were ok. I told her to look around this place Saturday at 7 o'clock and there are 15 people in here, there obviosly a reason this place is dead. Poor service and horrible food. Would not surprise me to see this place shut its doors. I remember this place always being packed and far better food. So save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. This place reminds me of the movie waiting. I think we had Naomi tonight. Lol. We will spend our money where it is honored. Stay away from this place! Trust me. Don't say that I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is  'not to be fucked with'
I got out of there with a $7 tab.
Find the \"Bailout Plan\" menu, order 1/4 cheesesteak.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!  Fast service with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We just moved back from San Diego after being gone 6 years , I grew up in north Phoenix and went to uncle SAMs  as often as possible .. Even after all these years the food was great and service as well , so glad to be able to eat at uncle SAMs again .. Great wings , salads , hoagies or anything on the menu it's great !!"}
{"text":"I've only had the cheesesteak, wings, and fries. All were decent. As a Philly native, I can honestly say the cheesesteaks are pretty good. They give you a generous portion of meat and actually cook the fried onions. The rolls are nothing like what you would get from an Italian bakery in Philly, but they'll do. I gave a 3 simply because there is no whiz available. Very disappointing :/"}
{"text":"I felt the prices where very high for the portions we got.  Food was good but it just didn't sparkle to me.  I could give or take coming back here.  I am just kinda eh with it.   I don't like that if you want anything extra you have to pay a very hefty price.... this is unfair and it really left me with a bad attitude about it as I just felt badgered by pricing. It's not expensive you just don't get much for the price so you have to order a lot and that is what makes it expensive. I don't expect free sides but good lord... they need to chill with their extra fee's.  Uncle Sam really handed it to me... and it wasn't even tax day!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe they are still in business.  1st time I went no one waits on you finally they got me a flat beer then a tough filly cheese steak with hunks of uneatable fat.  Complained refused to go back finally after a year I go 2nd time the steak was fine and cold fries no napkin no fork no dish begged for a check takes them a long time to make change can't  count shorted me a dollar thats ok I tipped them anyway.  Wen back again 3rd time took a while for the food bar mades were talking with more important friends then the customers took a very long time to get their attention.  This was officially my last time there ever.  My friend went about a few months ago got seated and never waited on so he walked out the greeters did say \"thanks for coming see you soon.\"  They got that part down.  If at all cost avoid this establishment unless you are a friend of theirs they will spend time serving you correctly."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Sams. It is right next to my boyfriends house so we go there all the time. They have the best wings and their pizza is great too! We also like to get their fried zucchini and mushrooms. Mmmm so tasty! Oh yeah and their beer is really cheap. If they didn't have all of those tv's with sports on my boyfriend might pay a little more attention to me. And I wish they served liquor. But oh well, I still love this place!"}
{"text":"they need more chains! my gosh I come from L.A. for everytime I step into Arizona my plans have to include Uncles Sams! everything I have had on the menu has been amazing. Their chicken wings are unbeatable! nothing can or will compare to it! hoagies are great as well preferablly the phillycheese steak good stuff!"}
{"text":"NEW HAPPY HOUR SPOT! Came in for dinner last night greeted and sat very quickly. Discovered the \"Bail Out\" menu.. Large pitchers of draft beer for $5... SOLD! Ordered a pizza and enjoyed both! 

Best part is the happy hour runs until 7pm! Being that I work in Scottsdale and live in Arrowhead it's great to find a place I can actually make it to happier hour close to home!"}
{"text":"Pizza can be good, service not always that great. Cant even place phone order because every time I call and say that I am Deaf they think its a joke. Definitly not ADA friendly.  Once I asked if they could turn on closed captioned, even with at least 10 tv's they didnt know how!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place has 2.5 stars. Went there hungover and my Philly w beer hit the spot. Sat at the bar and got great service from multiple people. Manager was cool and talked with me for awhile. Would go back just to have a beer and chill alone."}
{"text":"Honestly I would give it less if I could. In town for a vacation and we were staying in the area near here and this place kept popping up on recommendations to eat. Ate here our first night in town and was definitely not worth the time. Server seemed less than thrilled to serve us but was happy to serve everyone around us. Never told us her name or introduced herself. Ordered our food and it was bland and was not impressed with flavor. I did ask for a side of mayo and never received it but when other people were asking for sides or extras around us she had no issues in getting things to them quickly. She never once checked to see how things were or if we needed refills. As a tourist maybe not the place to go cause it seems like they only care about their regular customers."}
{"text":"My wife & I live close to Uncle Sams & we were craving some wings & we have always enjoyed them there & this time we had to send the food back the chicken tasted old or left out way to long & the fries were like mashed potatoes & the cheese sticks were not even fully cooked & the cheese inside was not stringy like it should be. We will not be going back there. The service was decent & the waitress was very tentative."}
{"text":"I used to go to Uncle Sam's all the time back in the day! The location on Shea and 32nd is by far the best! I went again last week and sure enough, it did not disappoint!

I always get the regular cheese steak sandwich, and sure enough, it was just as good as I remembered! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My old man has been going here since they first opened in like 79'. We have had some good cheesesteaks and we have had some bad ones but as of lately they have been bad. We live about 25 min away and today we got a cheesesteak and brought it home just to find a large amount of burnt pieces of meat and you can't tell me the cook couldn't see that he burnt the meat! This is the first time I have complained about the food, but the food is too expensive to not get the quality you deserve.  I had to drive all the way back and told them to keep it. Been going here since I was a kid. Cmon uncle sams!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place about 3-4 times a year.  I usually get either the cheese steak with peppers and mushrooms or one of the hoagies.  Had the cheese steak yesterday and it was pretty decent...could have used a bit more cheese though.  Lots of meat and veggies.  The roll was really good.  Overall, not in the same league as the cheese steaks at Jersey Mike's though."}
{"text":"Go at happy hour and enjoy some beer.  Skip the food unless you're really starved.  Go next door to Arby's for dinner."}
{"text":"I guess it's exactly what you'd think it is.  Huge bland portions paired with super sized cokes all the while surrounded by red, white and blue paraphernalia.  Gives old Uncle Sam a bad name."}
{"text":"I love the hoagies and grinders and wings here.  Also, 'Uncle Sam's Stimulus Package' or whatever they call it is a great deal for happy hour!  It's hard to get in and out for lunch hour though, best to order to go if you're under a time constraint."}
{"text":"I am a hot wing fan and this place has some pretty awesome ones. They're always meaty and crispy. Sometimes they need more sauce, as I like them saucey, but the waitress will easily comply with that request. Their individual pizzas are very good, they have lots of topping choices and they have good crust. Reasonably priced and great for a loud night out with friends."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with bacon on it and the bacon was literally raw....sorry to say this place has gone down hill. Wings taste old and nasty.  We've had bad pizza and wings many times in a row now....so won't be frequenting this place anymore."}
{"text":"The food at this location was horrible. Please save your money and time a choose a different restaurant if you consider going here."}
{"text":"We come here once in a while when we run out of ideas, lol...
It is always OK, not great, not awful. This time we came here just for an appetizer and I found it interesting how plain and boring their appetizer platter is. The food was OK (if you do not care about eating healthy), but the presentation was blah. : )"}
{"text":"Overall a good place for a neighborhood bar/restaurant.  Have pretty good Hot Honey BBQ Wings and calzones.  Don't come here if you are planning on drinking quite a bit.  Management will cut you off after 4 beers/2 half pitchers/1pitcher per person drinking.  Our waitress Lacey was amazing, but the manager cut us off after 2 pitchers (2 people drinking) even though there was a DD at the table and we were here for nearly 4 hours.  We weren't rowdy, nor was there anyone else to disturb.  When confronted about it, the manager said it was due to the owner, either way I feel this is bad policy; but he did give us a half pitcher more (and charged us for it) after we complained to him.  They also have fairly small TVs and they are up near the ceiling... Makes for watching sports not very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is that place I always think of when i'm in the mood for a Grinder or great Hogie. They seem a little pricey for a full size sandwich but let me tell you these sandwiches are fantastic!

Soft white bread that is piled high with your selection of meats and dressing that makes the mouth water just thinking about it. These sandwiches are made with pride and care and are not to be likened to a Subway, Fire House or Jersey Mike's Speedwich with inferior ingredients.

You can barely get this mound into your mouth. Their wings, White Pizza, and array of New York fashioned eats kill. The beer flows easily here and the menu is pretty vast and will suit almost anyone's needs. The restaurant is nice and fashioned with plenty of TV's to catch your favorite sporting events. 

Being right off of the 51 freeway at Shea lends to easy access and provides a quick way to get on to your next venue. They have been around for years and are a staple here in the valley! This is among my first choices when it comes to having an incredible bite when I'm craving a sub.

{"text":"5 stars for customer service
1 star for taste of food
1 star for pricing 
0 stars for food poisoning 
4 stars for ambience 

We stopped in and ordered 3 thin crust pizza. The pizza came out soggy. I think it had too much cheese on it and that caused it to be soggy. Not sure. The pizza was flavorful. About two hours later all of us are in extreme pain and spent the rest of the night and next day in the bathroom. Something in that pizza gave us food poisoning:(

Service from Brittney was awesome and she would be true only reason I would go back to try something else"}
{"text":"Yes, this place still REALLY sucks! A girlfriend of ours works there so we went to say hi.. while the service was great the food, not so much. Pizza here is horrid.. the crust and the topping were so dried out it was inedible. 

I ask you this.. why the hell would you need to order extra cheese and a cheesesteak? Makes about as much as sense as a trailer trash woman from Alaska as our next vice president."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special, but this is not one of those places you go for the food. You go for all the hot servers and happy hour!!!! The happy hour is awesome, beer is affordable, and so is the food.

They always have some type of game or sport on the multiple televisions, and it a good place to just hang out.

I did mention the hot servers, but they are all also awesome at what they do. They never forget about a table and just treat you well over all. 

Check this place out during happy hour or their reverse happy hour, you will like it."}
{"text":"We just read the health inspection report from Maricopa County in the June 21, 2017 Peoria Today. They had 4 core violations and 1 priority violation. Won't bother with posting what that detailed but we won't be back. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Ditsy waitresses, drunk idiots, and slow service. Plus, not to mention their idiotic Anti-Obama messages on their menus, and this after they were busted for hiring illegals....go figure! Don't waste your time or money coming to this place. There's a lot of choose from out there."}
{"text":"I think I actually 'hate' this place. Strong words. It started many many years ago when my dad had me pick up an order here for carry-out. They forgot to make half the order and when I came back to get it - they didn't apologize for over-charging me, about forgetting the order or seem to notice I drove back to get it. I sat waiting for the order for. ever. 

Forgetting to include food in a take-out order happens, it's a simple mistake, I get it. But they didn't respond appropriately, in any way at all, just kind of stood there like \"soooo does this mean you want us to make it now...err...maybe?...well....hmmm..\" My dad actually called the manager when I got back - the second time - and he didn't offer an apology or remedy the situation. 

The food is just awful. I save the word \"mediocre\" for frozen wings, pizza & subs from the freezer section - Uncle Sam's is not worthy, it's gross. 

If my review isn't enough to warn you to dine elsewhere, maybe the state's health inspection review is - 

How bad is a restaurant that actually needs the government to tell them to get rid of roaches?

{"text":"Dear Manager/Owner or whoever is concerned overall about this establishment,

When you read past reviews about negative customer service experience, BELIEVE them! That is why I write this post today.

 Last night was our FIRST time visiting your location. The food was delicious, the atmosphere, menu and prices rocked HOWEVER, the Slooooooow, inattentive and sub-par service may prevent future visits.

My first impression: On all doors you state \"no smoking\" even on the patio. Then why were there guys smoking and constantly blocking the walkways while the staff DID NOTHING? My grandson has asthma, at least the smoke wasn't blowing our way. Maybe because the young female waitstaff were too busy chit chatting with the smokers and  taking \"selfies\" with guys out on the patio. (can't help but wonder if \"their tables\" were experiencing really slooooow service). It appeared to me as though \" The Inmates are Running the Asylum\" ....In other words....the \"young pretty girls\" are allowing unprofessional behaviors to continue to the point of acceptance. 

Second: While trying to enjoy our dinner, a table of 4 absolutely inconsiderate women who absolutely SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO MULTIPLY just let their annoying 8+ brats to run wild all over the patio area and parking lot. This only made our visit even worse. If these gals are regulars....you can have them, I won't be back for that torture.

Overall, the service was incredibly SLOW and not very attentive. I had to get up from my table to hunt down to to go boxes, looking for our girl to get the tab ( and Yes we could have walked right without paying because she TOOK SO DAMN LONG, but that is not who I am) I waited way too long for another beer...by then I told her don't worry, just get my bill please. 

My advise...GET RID OF ALL THE HIGH SCHOOL junior and seniors and get some PROFESSIONAL  wait staff!!! Customers do not want to wait for them to finish their gab session to get a beer refill or their bill. Hell, next time....I'll just order and LEAVE because no one checks in or pay any attention to you!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to high school right down the street from Uncle Sams and it always has, and always will, serve excellent cheese steaks and pizzas.  

This is another restaurant that I try to visit on every trip to the Phoenix metro area, and in my mind is one of the staple restaurants in the valley.

The food is inexpensive and is always hot and delicious.  The service is superbly provided by cute chicas in short mini skirts, but alas is NOT trashy like that other restaurant, Hooters."}
{"text":"O.M.G.!!!!!!!  My son was dying for a chicken, cheese mushroom sandwich so I indulged him and stopped to pick one up and I am posting a photo of the lack luster sandwich he got for a whopping $17.00!!!  Uncle Sams - really???  Get your stuff together, this is the worst sandwich I've ever been shafted over!!!"}
{"text":"Grew up going here and still love it!!  Best take out pizza in the valley, but always fun to eat in too!  Can't go wrong with pizza and wings or have one of the delicious steak sandwiches, round it out with some onion rings or a salad!"}
{"text":"Okay, let's be honest, the only reason I keep coming back is the prices.  Low low low.  For my small family of three, we can eat for less than $20 (not including tip).  I love the cucumber ranch with the fried zucchini.  I always get the cheese steak on wheat.  Great that they have the option to get it on wheat.  My honey and son love the wings.  But that's it about this place.  Service sucks.  Good service is reserved for the regulars at the bar.  We can never get out of here in under an hour.  It's never busy anymore so there is no excuse.  It's very sad.  This place use to be wonderful.  I enjoy being able to go somewhere and watch the game while I eat, but I don't want to be there so long that I can watch most of the game!  Also, the girls dressed in short skirts and tight shirts is getting old."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizza is great, that's all I ever get when I go here. We like to go after 9pm for their $1 domestic drafts and $1.25 premiums. Pitchers are great too, I think it's $4 for domestic and $5 for premium! Blue Moon tastes so much better for that price! Haha

The girls that serve are all really nice, we made friends with one and love it when she's there. The patio is pretty blah, just some tables in front of the bar, but most of the people in our group are smokers so it's chill to hang there (especially because no one else sits out there.) 

My one and only complaint, and the reason it only gets 4 out of 5 stars, is because they close at 11. That makes it somewhat of a pre-gaming spot for us, but with those prices it's not that bad! I know it's a restaurant primarily, but they'd get one he'll of a night crowd if they kept it open til 12 or 1 at least."}
{"text":"We've been ordering carry out from this place for the past 3 years.  Love the food, - great flavors... and the price is great, too.  Our 2 item dinner (mini pizza and small calzone) gets us out of there for about $13.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Love the hot honey BBQ wings and the white pizza!can't beat the happy hour beer prices $1 pints domestic!!!love it"}
{"text":"Nobody can beat Uncle Sam's when it comes to bang for your buck. This is even more true during happy hour where the prices are insane and that runs from 5-7 & 7-9. Can get very crowded and is a bit old but it never bothered me and I think it adds character. Food is hot and the drinks are cold."}
{"text":"Good bar type food. True. It's also good for a casual group meal - split a few hoagies and cheesesteaks.
The pizza was alright, but nothing stands out.
The wings were decent - but you can't mix flavors (ie 2 mild, 2 honey bbq, 2 suicide, etc) like at other joints.
Now the steak and chicken sandwiches - worth it. A half is what most places label a regular size - and the whole - can feed 2-3 people. Hungry people. Which, I suppose it should be, for $12-14 a pop. I could see it being a fun place to hang out with friends. Parking sucks, as there are about 10-15 spots in front."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying thank god the food is pretty good. The staff is friendly but has no clue about customer service. The server we had delivered breaded mushrooms instead of zucchini. The plates and empty bottles were not cleared from the table until we got up to leave. A bus boy was squatting down in the waitress station checking his phone instead of clearing our table. The server came to our table at least 4 times during our visit and the the bus boy at least 3 times. The staff has no clue on how to clear tables. 

As I said the food is good, but service needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"I have been a regular of this place since they opened. When they were at Shea and the 101 I was always there. Since that location closed I now have returned to this location. If you are looking for fancy then skip this place. It is very casual, overall the service is good and I think recently there are some new cooks as the pizza crust has been exceptional. extremely reasonable prices, delicious, meaty wings and drummers, tasty cheese steaks on great rolls. Now if they would just get rid of the Pepsi and replace it with Coke they would be stellar. great place for kids too."}
{"text":"Located in a dimly lit strip mall near the 51 highway, and right near a pawn shop, Uncle Sam's is the epitome of \"out of the way\". But it's location belies its great food. For $15, I feasted on their wings (a little dry but otherwise tasty), fries, salad, and a Blue Moon (can't beat the happy hour price of $1.50). Service was great. Uncle Sam's, I want you (see what I did there?)!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I eat the cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches and pizza when I go.
I have enjoyed every meal, every time, always fresh ingredients prepared well.
The staff is very friendly and I really like the ambiance, the prices are fair as well.
I wish it were closer, it's an hour and a half drive round trip each time we go, but well worth  the trip.
I have taken many friends and business associates to Uncle Sam's and will continue to in the future.
I highly recommend you check this place out.

Ps. I left my sunglasses there a few weeks ago on a Saturday. They used my credit card receipt to get my name and labeled them with my name. I called the next day, to confirm they had them, 2 weeks later, when I finally went by, they had them waiting for me.... Really cool!"}
{"text":"The wings here are excellent.  The \"suicide\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"What can I say !!!! Maybe just that they serve it all wings, pizza sandwiches and ice cold beer plus the servers are real nice too.  Need a place where you want to grab a bite to eat without all the other stuff??? this is it!!!  kinda like the spot around the corner you have grown to love.  Here is where we came after a buddy needed help moving and dinner was on him, lots of choices and did I mention these guys get you food out \"real\" fast it will spin your head.  A++ Emoney Approved... 

Good affordable American Food :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food and all of the waiters are always super friendly! One thing that has really changed my opinion is the narcissistic asshole of a manager that works at night. The past three times I have gone in to get dinner for my family with my son he was yelling at all of his staff, belittling all of them over issues that should have been discussed in private. Like seriously dude you are not Gordon Ramsay. He is very improper when it comes to the difference between the female and male employees and quite frankly I was disgusted, if he were to talk to me like some of the ladies he was talking to I would have kicked him where it hurts and filed a harassment claim. 
End of story is all of the food and the kids working there are great even those that sometimes they make a mistake but their militant manager needs to get his mouth in check before they lose all of their guests! NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SCREAM AT YOUR EMPLOYEES WHILE TRYING TO EAT THERE DINNER THAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR! It's not just the food you pay for but service and the environment and he needs a new attitude or just to enlist in the military. Because I don't need my toddler seeing a man disrespecting women and men. All I can tell him is dude \"get in YOUR position\" as a manager or get out!

PS. I made a yelp account just to write this review because I was so disgusted by the manager."}
{"text":"Decent spot for some appetizers and bar style food. Zucchini and fried shrooms are good! 

Shared the chicken parm grinder and the wing combo with small fries this visit. The parm sandwich was not bad, tasted fine just nothing to brag about. As far as the wings.. I had medium flavor. The sauce was delicious and the right amount of spicy! I love spicy food. But the taste of the chicken tasted funny to me. Like that weird taste chicken gets. Don't know how to explain it, but that's all I eat is chicken so I feel I know when the taste of the chicken is good! And the wings weren't good. (At least the meat part) 

 Overall, the spot is not bad. Service was great! Zucchini was my favorite! And fried mushrooms were very good!"}
{"text":"Their to go service is horrible. Every time you call in an order you will sit and wait 20 minutes at least for your order to be ready. Today they had me all my items without a bag. I stood there for a few minutes so I can request a bag but I couldn't get their attention so I finally walked out before my food got cold. I don't care if this food is good or not the service sucks, they are always behind and they never seem to have their act together. They could really use someone to come in and Salvage that place!"}
{"text":"When I need a deal on a beer and a snack, this is the best place hands down!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with my parents. What a disaster this place has become. We used to come here a lot, the food was previously good, but on the pricy side. The TV's have always been a joke. You need binoculars to see them. Who puts tiny TVs that high? We had a new waitress that was hired for her looks and not her IQ. No problem, but she somehow messed our orders up. I ordered the Deluxe Philly Cheesesteak. It came with plain meat with shredded lettuce and sliced tomatoes on top. Who makes a cheese steak like that? Some of the meat was raw. Yuch! We sent the food back and asked for the check. Then this big dorky cook comes out 10 minutes later and states he re-cooked our orders and gave them to us in to go bags. I never eat anything which has been prepared by a pissed off cook, so we left it behind. This place has become a joke. For gods sake, hire a new cook and buy bigger TVs."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheesesteak.  I'm a Philly native, and these guys do it better than any of the many other places I've tried in the Valley.  Wife and kids say the hoagies are really good, as well.  Nice that they also offer a 1/4-size (in addition to the traditional 1/2 and Full) for smaller appetites.  Fries and rings are consistent.  

Why not 5 stars?  Beer choice is limited if you like microbrews/ales, service inside tends to be slow, pizza is pretty non-descript and wings are just o.k."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get traditional buffalo wings! The honey hot are a little sweet but they'll sting your lips! Service is solid. The decorations are hilariously white trash but I love it."}
{"text":"Sadly, Uncle Sam's has slipped.  I used to love it here, but the quality is just not the same anymore. Service has followed suit. The cheese steak that originally brought me in, now tastes no better than a mall food court."}
{"text":"All I wanted to do was .. Eat some pizza, wings and watch some football! However, this place comes with 19in TVS that have no sound. The pizza was just alright nothing to praise and the wings were good , but make sure you get what you paid for.. Some of the wings my sister had were missing some meat or just boney in size so she had the waitress take them back for new ones. First timer and I'll never be back! Use the advice mention about this place I wish I would've ! Don't waste your money! Oh and they charge for ranch! .75!!! Shouldn't that be free with wings ???"}
{"text":"Beware!! Food is awful. Had a cheese steak sandwich, it was dry and cold. Almost choked on every bite! I was too hungry and it was to late to go anywhere else or I would of... French fries came out cold and undercooked && DONT order the iced tea... I think it was brewed 3 months ago... Very sad because it's one of the few restaurants in my area that are open late."}
{"text":"I just had Uber Eats deliver the most disgusting Grilled Chicken Cesar Salad chicken was cardboard and croutons were stale. Coworkers very dissatisfied hoagie grinder was too spicey. 
Never again spent $8 for romaine and dressing"}
{"text":"Great food! But I would love to enjoy that food without the waitress in the corner doing nothing but \"trying to pickup a rich guy to support her daughter\" that's all I'm listening to right now. Its like a live soap opera, interesting but ANNOYING. She's working at the wrong restaurant. Our waitress was  nice and food was good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I typically come here for lunch. I get the individual portion of wings with mild sauce. Which even mild is spicy for me. I also get a pizza. Today I got a small size with half pepperoni & half ham. Every time I come it is so good. I have not tried anything else on their menu because I love their pizza and wings so much. Plus, they have tons of TVs."}
{"text":"Unreal. I'm sitting in the restaurant right now listening to the owner scream at his employees like an outrageous ass. The servers are doing whatever they can but the kitchen can't get decent food out. We waited almost an hour for cold food. Definitely not a place I'd recommend to anyone and definitely not a place for anyone hoping to have a good experience in a family friendly restaurant. The managers answer to nearby tables' complaints was \"sometimes it just happens...sometimes I yell\"."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to this place several years ago before I moved here.  Since I moved here, we've dined here three times.  It's a fun, casual place to take your family and enjoy bar food.  Here's a breakdown of what I've had:

Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich (Whole, $14.95) - Really good.  The Bread is decent and the Whole sized portion is enough for 2 people.

Uncle Sam's Special Pizza (18\" Large, $23.95) - It has virtually every topping on it.  Because it's crammed with toppings, it tends to get a little soggy even if it's ordered well done, which is how I order it.  Flavor is pretty good.  We always take a few slices home and it heats up well for leftovers.

Wings (Baker's Dozen, $7.95) - Our friends don't like the really spicy stuff, so we always order the Medium spice level and the Spicy on the side.  The Wings are really good.  Always served hot and they break away from the bone well.  The Spicy sauce isn't too Spicy....I like spicy food, so it's about average for me.

Large basket of Fries $3.23 - Decent sized basket.  Can serve 2-3 people.  Average flavor, reminds me of Wendy's Fries in terms of size and style.

Large basket of Fried Zucchini $4.95 - Can serve 2-3 people.  The flavor is average.  Always served hot and crispy.  I've never had soggy Zucchini here, which is a pet peeve.

The restaurant has plenty of seating and can easily accommodate a large group.  During one visit we had 8 people and it was very comfortable.  The Happy Hour here is pretty good, but I've never been able to try it because I'm always working.  The wait staff is young and relatively inexperienced, so you have to stay on top of them...however, that's to be expected in a restaurant like this.

Overall, we enjoy this place and will definitely return.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since i can remember.  they use to sponsor my little league baseball team!

stopped in last week with some work friends from out of town who wanted something different than Mexican Food!  Got the Cheesesteak with onions and peppers, fries and fried zucchini.  like always the food was amazing, the waitress was friendly and we got everything we wanted and refills.

the one thing i have to remember is i need to order a HALF since the whole is WAY too much food for me now :)"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets one star is because the girl who waited on us was terrific. 
If you love pizza, Don't go here!"}
{"text":"I eat out at least twice a day and I consider myself a food specialist. First of all,  I spent over $15 dollars for a cheese steak, soggy fries and a not so fresh lemonade!! I would of paid $2 more if I  had green peppers and mushrooms added on my sandwich. And on top of it, I was still hungry after wards!! Service was decent, girls were cute, that was about the only good thing about that place."}
{"text":"Over priced, flavorless food. The wait staff are slow. I'm def not coming back."}
{"text":"I can back here for the first time in about 6-7 years and this place is still a Gem. The service is still amazing. The food is still delicious and comparable to what I'm accustomed to in NYC. Everything is just perfect here. Huge booths, clean bathrooms, affordable menu items, Happy servers and fresh food. Get the steak sandwich and the wings. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my type of place. Err, atleast I thought it was. Pizza and beer and wings and hoagies? Word. (Insert chest bump).

The sandwiches turned out to be sub-par but the pizza was good and greasy, along with the wings. The beer was . . . well. . .  beer so I was ok with that. 

But all in all it just didn't do it for me. I think a contributing factor is that I have a couple of lady friends who worked there that all resoundingly agreed that the management were skeezy douchebags. I guess it just made it hard to respect after that. Besides, there are lots of places to get Bud Light pitchers (that are overpriced anyway) and chomp on some average bar food."}
{"text":"Well... this place is a trip!  You're greeted by Ronald Reagan and EVERY single piece of patriotic Americana you could imagine the moment you open the door.  Eventually you will be greeted by a typical teenage girl in a short skirt and tight t-shirt...  If you choose to sit in the restaurant, the service is intermittent, and you probably shouldn't expect things like refills as the teenage waitresses obviously have more pressing things to do than give you food or drinks...

Be careful when ordering your food by phone- there are items on the menu that don't make sense, and the cashier/phone girl will undoubtedly ask you a question about whether you want a grinder hoagie style- thus turning your grinder into a hoagie.  How are we supposed to know that this will happen??? When you pick it up, undoubtedly that same girl will tell you that it's your fault and that you need to take what you ordered.  That girl's manager (or elder or whatever) will then go re-make the correct sandwich... 

All of the hoagie style sandwiches taste about the same (meat, cheese, veg, salad dressing) but they're all awesome!  The grinders are different though, and great!  A friend made them make a corned beef and cabbage calzone for him- he said it was good..."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here (now living elsewhere), but I remember the honey BBQ chicken wings and the garlic bread with such fondness.  They were sooooooooooo good, I miss those two menu items.  While I've had good garlic bread in CA, I have not found the same caliber honey BBQ wings.  It was a great after-the-game hotspot for some really good, fun food.......and YUMMY."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Uncle Sam's for 20+ years. Today's lunch service was worst ever. I don't think the server had a chance with what the cooks weren't doing. Waitress was slow to get to our table and the drinks got there slowly. We waited for 25 minutes for food that was cold and over cooked. The onion rings were burned, the sandwiches were barely warm and did not have the grilled onions as ordered. The manager was apologetic but we left without eating. We will not be back. The service and quality have steadily declined over the last two years. Sad."}
{"text":"I had the worst food I have ever had At Uncle Sam's this afternoon. We ordered a 14\" pizza with a cheese steak sandwich.  The pizza was very greasy, the crust was extremely thin.  The cheese steak was nasty terrible with the meat burned with no extra onions as requested.

I haven't been here in probably 3-4 years and this was THE WORST food I have ever gotten here that was once my favorite place to eat.  Yuc, it was THAT BAD!  I will not go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered through UberEats. I ordered a pizza, wings, and some drinks. The pizza was ok. The wings were greasy and Tabasco hot, I couldn't taste anything but hot sauce. They were not good. While in Phoenix this was not on our list to try again."}
{"text":"This is the second time here and I just think the pizza crust just doesn't make it, it's dry and tasteless, from 1-10, its about a 5, I think the foundation of any pizza is the crust and I think they have the dough prefabricated already, no taste!"}
{"text":"Its not a good sign when on a Monday night, the place is maybe 1/4 to 1/3 full.  (They used to be full all of the time.)

We have been coming here for years....loved the wholesome, all American feel and the quality food.   And we often get the pizza and wings to go.   To go is better.

The pizza was very good; We had a sausage/pepperoni combo and I'd give it a 5. (It's our family favorite pizza.)

The wings had almost no sauce and were very dry; although the actual flavor was okay.   I'm giving them a 3.

And although we didn't have any sandwiches this time, I will say that what we have had in the past was very good....love the hot pastrami!

I had mixed feelings about the service:  

*  Our server was very nice and very good at checking back in with the table.   The beers were icy cold and she made sure we had fresh glasses to keep them that way.  She seemed a little inexperienced but had a good attitude.  I'd give her a 4+.

* I'm not a fan of the new outfits.  Most of the servers here looked like they belonged more in a go-go club in Vegas than serving at a neighborhood family spot....which is cool if you are at a bar in Vegas.    Hardly the 'all-american' look they used to have, and a turn off for the environment.  I'd give them a 0.

* Either the waitresses were very confused or the kitchen couldn't keep orders straight.  All 3 tables on our side (multiple servers) had wrong orders come out and/or had the apps and main course come out at the same time.   And the orders that were wrong, were way wrong.  (Although they did get the replacements out quickly.)  I'd give that component a 2 for the initial problem, but a 4 for the recovery.

Overall, I just don't like the new look.   We will continue to get the pizza to go but we can probably get better wings from Zipps."}
{"text":"Went last nite and it was awful. We go once or twice a month, and it's really going downhill both food and service-wise. Last nite service was terrible (see other reviews about the bimbos paying more attention to the drunk guys from the VW dealer who are always there) and food came out lukewarm at best. \"Waitress\" never checked on us so I had to go get us napkins and utensils, never got condiments we asked for, never got the water we asked for, etc. All in all, a crappy experience. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"AMAZING Service (ask for Ashlyn, she was Awesome)!!!  Very family orientated with a great atmosphere, great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was great! Did not appreciate the bald manager with glasses yelling \"hey butthead, come here!\" To one of his employees. She was a young girl and it seemed very rude and out of place. This is not how to treat people. The manager should be setting an example for the rest of the employees. Name calling is childish and has no place in a professional environment."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it's a must while visiting the Phoenix area. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and the best pizza, wings, and sandwiches in AZ. Whenever family comes in town this is our first stop, or we order it in to celebrate big events at home. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"They are not consistent with how the food tastes one week it's good and then the next week it's horrible they tend to switch cooks often. The servers are young and incompetent waitresses that are RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, and don't give the customers what they want!! We should get the food cooked how we want it at the prices their selling it at! They need to have a serious management reconfiguration. This used to be my favorite place now it's at an all time low! These guys need to be on the Restaurant Stakeout so the owner can see how his business is being ran!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is literally the biggest disappointment of my life!  Hardly even worth the one star I'm giving it! The soda tasted god awful. The boneless wings were really small. And it is really hard to fuck up a calzone! But guess what Uncle Sam found a way! It was burned and tasted gross plus they randomly put spinach in with the ricotta! Then when we brought it up to our waitress she just said \"oh let me put it back in the oven for you\". Which then made the worst calzone if my life exponentially worse it was dry and even more burned (almost black at this point)! The mozzarella sticks were cold and somehow the pizza sauce was steaming hot. Like somehow that makes up for the food being cold. And our service was awful there was like nobody in there so they were not even busy! So in conclusion all of our food was cold (mozzarella stick, boneless wings, and our shitty calzone) soda tasted gross and our waitress was useless! I would not recommend coming here you could go next door to Sonic pay half the price and get better food! If this place closes I would not even be shocked I don't know how this place is still open!"}
{"text":"I was greeted by the hostess with a mouthful of food.  She couldn't even speak to me for about 30 seconds until she finished chewing and swallowed.  The other employees were literally playing with the garnish/condiments behind the counter.  Overpriced and below average food."}
{"text":"This place is good when I need a quick fix for Pizza, Grinders, and wings. All three are pretty darn good."}
{"text":"This place is the best place I've eaten in Az.. I lived there for 3 years and I took my kids there often...I no longer live in Az and it breaks my heart that I had to leave Uncle Sam's behind"}
{"text":"First off I find it kind of upsetting that a place named \"uncle sams\" and has pride in the united states i can see the pride in the posters and what not on the walls as i am here now... I find it very upsetting and disturbing the \"uncle sams\" DOES NOT offer a military discount is kind of a shame to the name if i must say

Second the food was eh ok not to great but ok and we had to continuously wait for our waitress to ask if we needed refills on our drinks and the bill came WAYYYYY TO EARLY almost as if we were being rushed out of the place i doubt i will ever go back......"}
{"text":"The Italian sub was fantastic. Great ambiance and great service. The place is clean. So many options on the menu will put me back there"}
{"text":"So I've been told by someone that Uncle Sams has the best cheese steaks in town. I finally made it to the 32nd & Shea location and tried these so called best cheese steaks in town.

Being the food snob I am and somewhat of a cheese steak expert, I must say Uncle Sams has SOME of the best cheese steaks in. A close second in my opinion. The only cheese steak I've have in the PHX area that was better was at Flancers in Gilbert. Flancers are by far the best cheese steaks in town.

I will be back to Uncle Sams for another cheese steak and maybe give the pizza a try."}
{"text":"I don't go here often. Each time I do things are good. Food is good value and tastes good.  Good happy hour food and drinks. I have a friend with kids who likes to go here."}
{"text":"I go here weekly so naturally you're going to see a good review outta' me.  In sum: the wait staff is really on their toes, friendly, and know their stuff.  The food is gigantic, presented really well, and extremely tasty. Also, you can't beat the happy hour prices:  $1 drafts for domestic beers, 7 days a week.  Hi! When can I move in?  Uncle Sam's is a true gem hidden in the west valley. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok , not the worst divey place I've eaten at but not the best .. The wings are pretty good .. Fried Zuchinni not bad. We also ordered a calzon , no flavor .. Tasted like can and jar ingredients and was cold on the inside .. Asked her to re-heat it and still came back cold.. So we just had it boxed and I will put in the oven when we get home ! Staff seemed friendly , although no one seemed over 16 years old :-/"}
{"text":"Nothing quite like hearing the owner Brett reprimanding his employees infront of guests and employees. Shame on you sir, be more professional."}
{"text":"Just not \"all that\".  Pretty much bar food.

A yelper recommended this place as being the BEST cheesesteak in town.  Sadly my cheesesteak ...  was .... well ... just a pretty good cheesesteak.  I guess I don't know how you can screw up or enhance such a thing so I don't know what I was expecting.

The atmosphere is straight up sports bar and they seem to dress their waitresses in \"Hooters-esque\" tops ... not my thing.  

Not a bad place ... just \"there\"."}
{"text":"I'm going with 2 stars, normally I'd give them five stars because the food is more than excellent the girls there are super attentive and very cute, but that big dude with the bald head that stands up there by the counter looking miserable and in a hurry, just seems like he's always in a pissy mood and always mean mugging people. maybe I'm too observant but I think when you go to a place to eat, the people that work there shouldn't look like its a hassle to be at work. sorry, uncle sams but one bad apple spoils the bunch."}
{"text":"Holy crap these fries are salty and crispy. I asked about the fries and she said they can make them crispy for me I said no I prefer them soft. Oh well crispy and super salty it is. Oh yeah and crinkle cut. Generally that means frozen. Kinda tastes like it too. 

Ok cheesesteak, the whole reason for coming here, is good. No wiz but still well executed with white American cheese. The 1/2 size is a normal serving. A full would be two people. 

And the decor. Well if you aren't a die hard vote Trump republican then you might be put off. Just eat the sandwich and don't look up. 

Tl;dr : order the 1/2 cheesesteak with confidence and skip the fries."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Sams. I grew up in this area and have fond memories of ditching high school to nosh on pizza slices and cheese hoagies.

Now as an adult, I still love their pizza and now love their amazing beer specials. As the financially responsible parent in the family, I love that we can share a large pizza, a couple of small portioned appetizers, a pitcher of beer for the grown ups, and a soda for the kid for under $30. All while watching a game on one of the many TVs."}
{"text":"So disappointed in their philly cheese steak. I picked one up to go and it was the most salty sub I've ever had. The fries tasted like they were from yesterday. Last time I had the same thing and the meat was burnt. I won't be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I attempted to order a bakers dozen wings, ten medium and three simply left with no sauce. I was REFUSED. Seriously? I'm not asking for two different sauces, I simply want my toddler to be able to enjoy a few without having to order well over what the both of us would eat. Why can't you just set a few to the side? Shame on you guys for calling yourselves a family restaurant. UPDATED: You'll notice that the manager himself called me belligerent when he admits in his statement that he neither spoke with me nor even heard my half of the conversation. Belligerent over wings? No. I simply questioned the legitimacy of the denial and said that I'd rather eat elsewhere. Furthermore, unlike your ridiculous comparisons, what I asked of you would have taken absolutely no extra time and money from your business."}
{"text":"Amazing Hawaiian pizza! Will definitely be back.  Pepsi products served here.   Lots of cheese and flavor.   Huge Canadian bacon!  Nice tall drinks.   Great ambience"}
{"text":"Best friend and I were shopping and as that's such a strenuous activity we worked up quite an appetite.  She'd been talking about the wings at this place for a whole week since she first tried them so we decided to go so I could check it out too.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside and it'd be easy to miss so make sure you're looking closely!

It's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside which I was happy about because no one likes a cramped eating space.  We were greeted and seated right away which is always nice and the hostess was friendly.  Our server arrived quickly as well and was also pleasant.  My friend decided on the Honey Hot boneless wings and I went with Medium, we also wanted to try out the pizza so we split a 10\" Pepperoni.

The food came out pretty fast which was good because we were hungry.  The wings were a good size, perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and they had a great flavor.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We polished off the whole thing and I'm justifying it by telling myself it was small so it's okay.  My only tiny little pet peeve (and this is going to make me sound like a diva...) is that the water tasted like unfiltered tap water.  I hate to bring that up but Arizona water does have it's own special \"flavor\" and it just wasn't great.  With the exception of that though I loved everything about this place and I will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Good service, clean  & GREAT Philly cheese steak!"}
{"text":"Years ago I used to eat at the Scottsdale location quite a bit for lunch and occasionally the Peoria location. This place was never great, but it wasn't bad either.  It was just a place to go when you were feeling especially hungry as the portions sizes are filling.  Over time, I noticed the quality started to slip and I no longer wanted to spend my hard earned money there.  The other day I took my family to the Peoria location after a several year hiatus from this place.  We were in the area, so I decided to give this place another try; hopeful that things had improved over the years.  Wrong!  The Peoria restaurant is dump.  The floors were dirty, our table was dirty, the TV's were dirty, the bathrooms were dirty, and even the waitresses were dirty, (which is the only good thing I can say about this place, eh hem).  We attempted to watch the Cardinals game on TV, but found it difficult to see the game as most of the TV there are about the size of my computer monitor at home.  Ad into the mix horrible reception, and this place does not make for a good place to watch a sporting event.  We were sat at a table where sunlight was piercing through an opening in the window covering blinding my wife and daughter who were facing it.  We asked our server to close the blinds and she told us that there was nothing she could do because the window was not in her area.  Huh?  She told us to wait it out as the sun would be gone in about an hour.  We were not expecting to be there more than an hour so there was no way we were going to sit there being uncomfortable so instead we jumped to an empty table across the aisle to prevent the laser beam from burning a hole in our heads, which seemed to piss off our server because she was losing money by losing a table because no one wanted to sit there.   My son and I ordered the meatball sub and when it was delivered I knew immediately something was wrong.  The sauce was black in color.  One bite confirmed what I already knew...the sauce was burnt.  My son and I opted to send it back which prompted the manager to come over to our table and explain to us that they removed the peppers from their original sauce recipe thus making it that color.  What a load of crap!  Removing peppers from tomato sauce will not make tomato sauce turn black nor will it make it taste burnt, over cooking it will.  Even if it had this effect, why would you think anyone would find this color or flavor appealing?  I am 45 years old and 240 pounds, needless to say, I know meatball subs.  The sauce and meatballs were overcooked.  Old sauce, continuously reheated sauce, and excessive temperatures produce this effect on tomato sauce.  My son and I opted to try another sandwich instead, but by the time our food finally arrived the rest of my family had long since finished their meals and were anxious to leave.  Even our replacement sandwiches weren't all that great so I paid our bill and got the hell out of there with ¾ of my  sandwich sitting there on the table.  To add insult to injury, our crappy meal was nearly 80 dollars for three adults and one small child.  That is way too much money to spend on food like this, in a place like this, Flemings or Firebirds yes, but not Uncle Sam's restaurant."}
{"text":"just wish they would open up again just a small place in scottsdale ...i'd go at least once a week....love the wings...best in town! been going to the one on shea but ohhh so far......won't drink and drive from there...been asking them since they left scottsdale.......come on back guys....we miss ya!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever,  went there lastnight and waited 25 min to get my order , waitress was very rude she took my water to refill and never brought it back it was a slow night and she was extremely inconsiderate of us as if she did not even care about us being at uncle sams . Never going back"}
{"text":"We went to a birthday party tonight for a friend. I had never been here before, but it was very easy to find and we were quickly seated to where our friends were at. They had ordered about five pizzas and hot wings so by the time we arrived it was practically no waiting time . Pizza was awesome. My favorite had to be the meat lovers. Wings were good. Hot wings were perfect, but I really enjoyed the honey bbq. I made a separate order of two sodas for my boys and an order of hot wings. Also great, but when our bill came I was a bit in shock that my bill had been charged a gratuity. I get that for the entire party bill, but for the three of us to have a couple sodas and appetizer threw me off a bit. It wouldn't keep me from coming back though because the waitresses did great for the amount of people at the party. I"}
{"text":"Great place, highly recommend the Philly cheese steak with extra cheese. Only problem is some days it's stacked, others it's way too light."}
{"text":"We had the steak and chicken and pepper sandwiches and they were AWESOME. Kristen was our server and she was fantastic, very friendly, informative and attentive. Our first time here, we will be back!!! Oh and happy hour on Saturday with ice cold beer was an extra bonus!"}
{"text":"My so-called 'life coach' called last week from jail asking if I'd come down and throw his bail.
I knew something about the guy didn't smell right when he told me I could turn vegan by simply limiting my diet to beer and Cheetos. What an asshole.

Anyway, I'm at Uncle Sam's when he calls, mainly because they have cheap beer...their 'bailout' plan as it's called.
I call it my vegan plan.
Sixteen ounce Coor's and Miller light drafts for $1.25 every day from 3 to 7.
Dos Equis Amber for $1.50.

Loosely translated, this means I can throw back ninety six ounces for nine bucks, putting me squarely in the .0143  B.A.L. range.
If I extrapolate these figures over the course of their four-hour happy hour, I figure I'm around thirty bucks in for around two and a half gallons and a solid .30 BAL.
Pretty righteous, eh?

And the food.
The philly cheesesteak is my favorite, followed by one of the white pizza's and a dozen (actually 13) crispy hot wings. It should be noted at least one of the 13 is from a chicken who looks like it may have been a troublemaker, the farmer hobbling its wing with a hammer or something.

Anyway, the guy IS my neighbor, so it's the least I can do to bail him out. 
But i am firing him as my life coach, the little prick, and I'm also demanding his parents pony up the three hundred on his bail."}
{"text":"Top 5 worst dining experiences! Food was horrible! Undercooked, cheap bar food that they are charging $12 for. Service was worse than the food! The waitress had the worst attitude and we waited over an hour for our food. Never coming back again. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love their cheesesteaks, but it seems like the meat has gone downhill as of late. That being said, service is usually solid and I have started going for the hoagie grinder which is awesome. It comes toasted with cheese and bell pepper on top of sliced cold cuts. Pick up to-go a lot and it's always quick and delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sub a couple weeks ago I ended up getting a sub with sliced sliced sausage and marinara. It seems like they were out of meatballs but neglected to tell me that. So i ended up with something i didnt order or like. Sausage was very chewy and unflavorful. I used to come to this place alot when i lived in the area and it was awesome but now not so much. If your out of meatballs just tell me. Dont give me something i didnt order. I dont like giving negative reviews but had to on this one. Good luck uncle sams"}
{"text":"I would rate this one star but I am giving two stars to the waitress that actually helped us. We waited 20 minutes before another waitress realized we had yet to even be asked what we wanted to drink. We asked her to serve us as our waitress seemed clueless her job was to take orders and be prompt, that's what tip stands for. She immediately helped a big table that came in after us. I'm sure she saw money there not a couple with a young child. I did tip the girl that helped us 25% as she was prompt with helping us. The food was good as usual. I love their ranch with their fries."}
{"text":"Eh, just alright.  The honey hot wings were decent, a little crispy on the outside, but some of them were dry on the inside.  Onion rings and fries were good.  Had some cheese steaks, which had a big portion of meat, and included onion, hot and/or sweet peppers.  Although portions were big, the cheese steak itself tasted bland, and it was even hard to taste the cheese in the cheese steak."}
{"text":"I wish this place was in L.A.  Every trip to Phoenix I come here.  The happy hour beer prices are mind boggling... $6 for a pitcher of Blue Moon?  Count me in!  Wings are A+ and pizza is B+ and prices are dirt cheap!  Oh and everyone is super friendly and the service is very good. Looooove this place.  This is the sort of down home awesomeness that I don't think even exists in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Why do we go to Uncle Sam's?   WINGS!  WINGS!  WINGS!   ...and lot's of 'em.

*juts out lower lip until it protrudes and starts channeling \"Bubba\" from Forest Gump* - \"They've got buffalo wings, bbq wings, mild wings, medium wings, hot wings, suicide wings, honey bbq wings, honey hot wings and honey hot bbq wings....they've got wings, lots of wings, I like wings\"

Sure we've tried their pizzas and sandwiches, but they're consistently mediocre...at best.  The service can be spotty and negligent.  Occasionally they've had their surprisingly good service at times, but more often than not it's lacking.

What does keep us coming back are the wings and a lots of cold beer to wash 'em down. Holy cow, you can even order a platter of 100 wings if you want!  Usually we order a few different types and share.  I love the suicide & the honey hot, the hotter the better!  Mmmmm good stuff.  

I'm willing to overlook crazy Uncle Sam's flaws to indulge in some tasty wings, and if the service is slow that night there's always a game on one of their numerous televisions.  If there was a rating just for \"wings & beer\" they'd get 5 stars.  Too bad they miss the mark on everything else."}
{"text":"I love the mushroom cheese steak here, but the service is ALWAYS lacking. My boyfriend and I like to pop in here every once in awhile, but I think I would rather just get takeout next time. The servers never introduce themselves and everybody just stands around the bar and stares when you walk in. This has happened on more than one occasion. The service staff constantly comes across as rude when at the table and it's honestly a turn off. It would just be nice for the staff to act like they MAYBE care about the customers let alone their job."}
{"text":"The food is great - but hit or miss on the service and if food comes out hot.   My waitress told me - when my hot steak and cheese sandwich came out cold - that in order for my hot and cheese steak sandwich to be hot -I have to ask for it toasted.  ???????    We only seem to have an issue when we order pizza with meals.   Manager of restaurant should be more aware of issues and checking tables."}
{"text":"Worst management I have ever seen.  Witnessed  the Manager calling his staff a bunch of B!tches.  Nice! All this because it's almost 10 o'clock and they shut the TVs off early.  The Manager also stares you down like you are a piece of meat.  I guess if you are a painting customer you are not to be trusted.  Food is sub-par also.  Would not recommend going to a place with subpar food and crappy management Who treats college age girls just trying to earn a living this way."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to my father and I on our Spring Training trip to Phoenix (go Giants!... okay so they got slaughtered but that's ok).  We ordered the wings (hot honey) and pizza (white w/ 3 cheeses and tomatoes).  The food was delicious but not ridiculous as the car rental agent had gushed over.

We washed it down with a few hefeweizen's and my dad wished we could have gotten a drink but they only serve beer and a few \"box\" wines; we had chuckled at that too.  The waitress didn't know what any of the wines were called just that they were red or white and came out of a box.

Maybe steer clear of the wine if you wanted some.  My dad didn't complain but then again he doesn't ever complain so don't take that as any indication.

Overall the waitresses were stunningly gorgeous and the service was great, the food was better than average but nothing to actually log into Yelp directly after and rate a 5 star, and the decor was sports bar-ish.  There were lots of loud patrons and your normal crowded restaurant noises.

I'd have rated it a 4 star if I had been able to get a bar drink but everything else was good.  Maybe I'd have rated it higher if the rental car agent hadn't hyped it up in my mind before actually going."}
{"text":"I will never be back. We went once for dinner upon a friend recommending their cheese steak. We ordered an Italian sub and meatball sub. The waitress brought out the food within 3 minutes of ordering. My sub wasn't even hot which was a deal breaker for me. The Italian that I had a bite of had barely any meat on it. Thank goodness the fries were worthy. To top it off, our check was over $30 which is ridiculous for 2 sub-par subs, fries and 2 Cokes. It was Subway quality IMO. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"My roommate and I wanted to check this place out as a potential spot for watching big games and getting some good food. It definitely didn't accomplish either for us.

It has about 30-40 TVs but most of them are around 24\" so it's not exactly easy to see detail in the games. Their largest TVs are by the bar. The hostess and waitress were nice. They accommodated us well to watch a specific game where they sat us. 

The good was typical average dive bar food. Crappy onion rings, a Philly cheese steak that wasn't too? bad, and \"boneless chicken wings\" that were? more like Tyson frozen chicken nuggets. Fries with no seasoning or salt. Thank goodness they had a good bottled root beer. 

Overall just not worth the price and not a great venue for big games. Definitely not a place we're expecting to return to."}
{"text":"I am giving four stars because this place is pretty decent.  The hoagies are huge, the cheese steaks are delicious  and they have this menu called the Bail Out with mini versions of items off of the main menu, most of which are under $5.00.

My last visit was a little rough .  We found out they were training new staff so things took a little longer than normal.  I chalk it up to just being there on a bad day.

I will be back for more noms in the future."}
{"text":"I agree with Albert about the Recession 'bailout\" menu not really being a bargain.  I had the Uncle Sam's Italian Special.  The sandwich was a 1/4 club for $4.  They stuffed it with a lot of toppings, and it was hard to close the sandwich.  It was also dripping with some kind of oil/dressing, so it gets all over your hands.  

The service is not good.  I've been here twice, and both times my drink was never refilled.  That's a huge pet peeve, as I am a camel and need to stay hydrated."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's cheese steaks are great... but don't try anything else.

I thought I'd try a stromboli which is rare to find here in AZ as an ex-east coaster.  I walked in and placed an order to go which is also probably a bad idea due to the fact that the person taking my order didn't listen.  An additional mistake is not checking my order and catching it before I left but I ended up with a calzone which has ricotta cheese which I hate.  I had two bites and threw it away.  The crust is tasteless and somehow the steak tasted so bland outside of that fresh roll.  May not be back for awhile."}
{"text":"I am a native of the Philadelphia area so I know a bit about cheese steaks and hoagies.  My wife and I have been looking for a local restaurant where we could get good Philadelphia food and when we saw an ad for Uncle Sam's we were excited that maybe this could be the place.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  The insides of the sandwiches were fine but the rolls failed the test.  If you know what a good cheese steak or hoagie really is then you know that the roll is everything!   Sorry Uncle Sam, good try though."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had. 32nd Shea has some wonderful restaurants. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Used to be good, but the owner seems to have skimped on quality and service."}
{"text":"Literally by far the worst service I have ever received. The server was very rude and checked our id's when I clearly look 45. As she was bringing the beers she spilled it all over my new fidget spinner. The food was subpar and took far too long. $30 for a sandwich?!?! I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is a local institution, so I'll always be loyal.  I try to make it to the original Shea/32nd St. store whenever possible, though.  The Scottsdale store often makes me feel taken advantage of.  

See, the thing about Uncle Sam's is that it started out as a kind-of hangout for high schoolers.  Which explains the haphazard atmosphere, service and menu.  But the food was great and service was efficient and friendly; so the kids just kept coming over the years and now have gotten their kids and grandkids on board.  All the good stuff is pretty much still there at the original location.  

The casual attitude often turns into neglect at the Scottsdale store, though.  Resulting in sloooooow service, no refills and food that's cold by the time it gets to you.  So unless I'm right nearby, I usually steer toward the 32nd St. location when that cheese steak craving hits."}
{"text":"This place has a great, food rocks and serves the bests wings in town."}
{"text":"This was the weirdest dining experience I've had. Everything was great until our food actually arrived and the server dumped my all American grinder all over the floor. She said the manager would comp the meal and a new one would be out shortly since the rest of my party was eating. The next one came out about ten minutes later and was okay. When the bill came, the manager had not taken off the grinder and the server went to talk to the manager. When she came back she said the manager would not comp the grinder and that she would have to pay for it. I told her that wasn't necessary and paid for the sandwich. The complete lack of ethics and class on behalf of the management would lead me to eat ANYWHERE else in the future. Oh, and the best part is the dropped sandwich sat on the floor next to our booth the entire meal. We left and it was still all over the floor with all of the servers stepping over it as they walked by."}
{"text":"I don't know if my feelings would be as strong as Ester J's. I haven't tried the bailout plan so I can't comment on the positive review given by Chris P. What I can tell you is that cheese steak is horrible. The bread is soft, and anyone who knows cheesesteak, knows that the roll is vital. It has to have the correct taste and the perfect chew. Moreover, the steak itself resembled ground beef more than a cheesesteak. The cheese was nonexistent. The sweet peppers were not sweet, just bitter.

As for pizza, it is your basic bar pizza. It can't rival a bar pizza like the Rainbow Room in LA. Its a bar, and the pizza is okay, flavor not so bad, pepperoni is packaged, cheese is not pure whole milk mozzarella.

There is nothing wrong with going to Uncle Sams. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Good food, service is spotty, bar has a weird feel but they have the closest thing to a Pittsburgh hoagie that I can get so... yeah."}
{"text":"Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind ... Memories, sweetened thru the ages just like wine...

Oh the memories this Uncle Sam's has for me. My entire extended family used to use this as our impromptu reunion spot when I was a wee child.  We still meet up here on occasion for nostalgia's sake.

My two female cousins used to torture me and I would end up in the bathroom crying every single time. That is until I called my cousin a hooker. Nobody knew what it meant, but it stopped their constant berating so it did the trick.

I cannot imagine a better happy hour. Pitchers of premium beer are $2.99 and their food is like $3. You can get a bud light on draft for $0.75 if you are into that sort of thing.

I always get the cheese hoagie (Cold) with the sweet peppers. Delish. Everything here is good, though, including the pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks. 

The only reason they don't get a five is because they have horrific service. Sorry, it's true.

Come. Enjoy. Watch Football. Play the Vintage Pacmen Game. Just don't let your cousins torture you for five years.. just call them a hooker from the get go. Trust me, it works."}

{"text":"Great service, great food. Their SS Special pizza is one of our favorites. We always substitute Capicola for bacon and that combination is much better IMHO.  Their patio is dog friendly but the smokers were a little annoying.  

A proprietor should not permit smoking within 20 feet of the establishment's entrances, open windows, or ventilation systems, as defined in the rules by R9-2-102. The purpose of the 20 foot rule is to prevent smoke from entering into areas where smoking is prohibited."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Uncle Sams since it open on Shea blvd in the late 70's. Being from South Jersey and know what a cheesesteak should be, I was happy to have Uncle Sams out here in AZ. It's not quite the cheesesteak from home but it's a pretty good second. You just can't get the rolls like back east, might be the water I don't know, anyway I would venture to say that not to many people have suggested Uncle Sams to people for their Cheesesteak and hoagies then myself close to 40 years now. But I unfortunately CANNOT no longer. They've become so inconsistent with the quality of their cheesesteaks that you never know what your getting. The last time which was yesterday 5/5/18 my wife picked up the order and drove all the way home to open my cheesesteak to find burnt steak and you couldn't eat it. Other times it's full of grizzle or half the amount of meat you normally get. When your paying the prices that are being charged for a whole cheesesteak you expect it to be consistent and worthy of a $19.00 sandwich. This review is hard cause I've supported Uncle Sams for like I said a very long time and finally after several years of getting one order is great the next horrible and hoping they get it right to now it's like \" a box of chocolates \" you never know what your going to get."}
{"text":"Wish I could give negative stars.

Called ahead to verify they were open for business, was told that \"everything was warming up\", but yes, they were open.

Arrived at 9:36, left at 10:01.

My g/f waited at least five minutes to be seated, while I went to use the restroom.

Also, your waitress took my g/f's order and brought drinks, but never came back to the table after I came out of the restroom. And my g/f said the waitress wasn't even in her uniform yet, and changed after she took the order.

Never received the appetizer, never had my order taken.

Seriously, get some softer fucking toilet paper and paper towels. That's a really chickenshit way to make more profit."}
{"text":"Food was tasteless. Had honey bbq wings & fries. Cheese chicken hoagie was excessively salty. Portion sizes are average but pricing for them above average. service was a joke. Thursday night. About 10 servers and 12 tables full of 2-4people. We waited over 15 min for the wings & fries. 6 minutes later the waitress tells us the kitchen boys didn't read the order & only made half the chicken sandw, can she bring the 1st half out??? Really?!?! My son had to hunt the waitress down since age never came back to pick up our check.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst experience here yet. We were seated promptly but then waited 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order. The waitress apologized and said she would have the manager come talk to us. He never came. We got our food and everything was fine. Then we went outside and we're talking to some friends that came in as we were leaving. There is a window to the kitchen outside. We witnessed the cooks eating in the kitchen. And then we witnessed a cook take off his gloves, reach into his pocket and pull out what I believe was Anbesol and put the medicine in his mouth over the fry station. He then grabbed the glove box and put new gloves on, didn't even bother to wash his hands. Most disgusting thing I've ever witnessed in a restaurant. They just lost our business for good."}
{"text":"Awesome happy awesome wings (honey hot the best) awesome grinders (special). We are from Seattle moved here in July visited for the first time last night. Sat right away, nice waitress, cheap pitcher ($5 Dos Equis), food came fast, and it was all great!"}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is huge. And on the day I went, Uncle Sam's was freezing cold. So cold that I think I saw a polar bear run by. So cold that I had to zip my jacket all the way up and wear the hood.  Does it cost too much to heat this joint or what?
Other than that, the pizza was good, our server was great and the portions were huge.  I'd say the food is pretty inexpensive for the amount that you get too.  
If I watched football or basketball, or actually any sport at all, I'd definitely come here for that. Plus I've heard that you won't find a better Philly cheesesteak in Arizona- if you're into that kinda thing.
All in all, Uncle Sam's is a fairly cheap, fun and casual spot to come for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Bro in Law takes me and the fam to a new place.. and I'm in love.

Everyone at the table was very happy with their orders.
Wings were good
Philly was good
Pizza was good
Frys were good
Hoagie was good

Now on to the Great!

We happened to catch the happy hour and had some cheap beers! 

$2.99 each....... Each Pitcher!!!!!!!!   GREAT!

MEATBALL GRINDER~ GREAT!

I can't wait to get back to Uncle Sams!"}
{"text":"I miss this place so bad. First off, the calzone's are amazing, the outer crust is crunchy but not burned and the interior is filled with warm fillings of your choice ( I like spinich and pepperoni) and really good tomato sauce. The pizza, fries and wings are all very good and the fried zucchini is fantastic. The waitstaff have always been good to me and the prices are pretty decent. A sidenote, try the ranch dressing... really fresh and not too thick or heavy. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great considering they make mostly homemade items. Certainly better than the chain restaurants"}
{"text":"I like Uncle Sam's, my kids like uncle Sam's. The wings are awesome and the sandwiches kick some serious ass. But, that's right there is a but...they need to decide whether they want to be a family type place or a sportsbar catering to drunken idiots. 

I know to expect that the bubble-headed hostesses will be clueless, and the service will most likely be average to below-average. I know these things, and I accept them in order to get my fix of the awesomeness known as honey-hot chicken wings. I just deal with it. 

So, Saturday night. The kids, my GF and myself headed over to U Sam's for some grub. Proabably about 6:30 or so. The hostess sat us right next to the front door, and right next to a booth occupied by 6 drunken assholes. Constantly getting up and down, jumping around, yelling, and loudly cursing. I sat there and took it, the GF and kids just gave me the look that said \"please don't go over and have a talk with those jerks\". Just let it go. And I did. Until finally, my GF had had enough and went searching for the manager. I'll just leave the story right there. 

Suffice to say that the manager was an incompetant boob of a woman who might be better off managing a Uhaul dealership. 

So, Uncle Sam. Please figure out what it is you want to be, train your staff and maybe I'll go back. But for now, it's going to be call-ahead to go orders."}
{"text":"Ordered the whole cheesesteak to go, about $19. Got home and everyone eating it chewed into gnarly disgusting pieces of I don't want to know, on top of chewing hard rock- like pieces. Totally disgusting and lost our appetites. Ended up throwing most of it out since we tried to give it another chance...nope, not going to choke on that gristle and break my teeth thank you. Used to be great quality, not any more."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  This place has steadily gone downhill. Went for lunch today and my wife got a super-thin slice of tomato on her sandwich after she had asked for extra tomato. When we pointed it out to the server, she said there are 2 slices on the sandwich. We showed her that was not true so she informed that we would have to pay another 50 cents for another slice... What!!!  Also they served our appetizer with the main course. A terrible experience all around. We won't be bothering them anymore."}
{"text":"Gave it another shot.  Ordered pick up.  Got home. They forgot my wings.  It's my fault, I should have checked.  Fool me once......"}
{"text":"Love Uncle Sam's. Service is always fast and friendly and I have been going to this location since it opened. The Cheese Steak sandwiches w/ hot and sweet peppers are the best I have found in the Valley. Just awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best Philly cheesesteak in the valley that I have had! I'm a native Philadelphian and I know what cheesesteaks should look and taste like. Uncle Sam's on Shea Boulevard got it to a perfect T! The owner who is also from Philadelphia brought the authentic cheesesteak with him to the valley including the right ingredients, flavor and quality."}
{"text":"A friend of mine raved about the wings and philly cheese steak at this location, and it was good.  However I feel as if it were talked up so much that it took away from the experience.  I would definitely eat here again.  When I first entered this restaurant it was pretty busy, but I love the feeling and atmosphere of locally owned \"mom & pops\" locations!  They tend to have more of a personal touch to their services.  I have no complaints about this location, the staff were pretty friendly to me.  There was a little confusion to track my order down, but that is common when all hands are on deck and customers are coming in and out."}
{"text":"The pictures here (Yelp) don't show the newer Shea location in Scottsdale. Looks like central Phoenix to me.

Dined here last night while watching the Spurs wreck the Suns :(

Chicken wings are great, the hoagies are amazing, prices are very reasonable, the service is decent. 

A great casual place to chow and watch a game."}
{"text":"Great place to stop after work for some pub grub and a beer or two - NOT a destination bar! Very casual feel.

The place is absolutely HUGE and mostly empty.

Not much else to say..."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steak in town.  A large will feed 2 people.  The honey hot wings are really good too.

Overall, this is a wonderful \"cheap eats\" they always have a food specials and drink specials.  They know the economy isn't doing so well and they price the food out accordingly."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have some of the best cheese steak sandwiches in the Valley. In fact, I think they are the best in the Valley. I know that might not be saying much, since there isn't a lot of quality cheese steak in Phoenix, but they are really good.

Other than super cheese steak, the beer is good (mostly domestic, but some good stuff too). Their bailout program provides smaller portions for smaller prices, which is creative and nice if you don't want an entire half sandwich. 

It's great for takeout, but the interior is straight basic sports bar. I'm not  a sports fan, so I could care less about how many TVs they have or what's on, all I'm there for is a cheese steak and a beer.

So far, I think the one on Union Hills and 83rd Ave has WAY better service than the one on Shea/101. That one nearly turned me off of the restaurant with awful service! We mostly get takeout, but the one time we ate in, the service was attentive and excellent.

It's not grande cuisine. It's a sports bar with beer, pizza and sandwiches. If that's what you're looking for, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been here a handful of times. Food is bland, service is slow. If you're from Chicago and love Portillo's you will be very disappointed. Last time I was at Uncle Sam's the server dropped a basket of hot wings on my 6 month old daughter's head. Fortunately it just glanced off and left a little sauce in her hair, no big deal. She wasn't even going to apologize except the manager berated her right in front of us for being careless. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food today at Uncle Sam's.  Mushroom philly cheese steak with jalapeños is the bomb. Renee is always great to have as your server. She still has never thrown me out so she's my favorite."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 subs from this place, both without onions as we have a family member who is very allergic to onions.  We made it very clear that absolutely no onions in the order. Spent over $50 on the 2 subs, one was the uncle sam original, one was the cheese steak.  There were a ton of onions on both subs, we tried to take them off, but we couldnt salvage any of them. We complained to the delivery company, but they said there was nothing they could do. 
Additionally, we are from the east coast and these are NOT traditional hoagies and the cheese steaks are NOT philly cheese steaks, so if thats what you ate looking for, this place will highly disappoint.  The hoagies did not even have any oils or mayo or anything, looked very very dry.  Tge cheese steak had no mayo or anything, and was also missing the cheese...i mean, come on.  I would skip this place...not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up down the street and my family has been ordering food from Uncle Sam's since I was in grade school. We've always been a fan of their cheesesteak subs. 

I recently came back to Phoenix to visit and was craving a cheesesteak sub. I knew that I had to try Uncle Sam's. These guys do it right. I had forgotten just how great their cheesesteak sandwhiches were! Many places make a decent Cheesesteak, but only Uncle Sams gets the 5 star nod from me. This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I just can't get into Uncle Sam's. It seems to be busy every time I drive by, and the couple times we've eaten here, it's been OK, but that's all. I guess I'm not wild about the food. The service is OK, lots of youngish girls running around, bumping into each other. The pizza is very pricey if you order takeout. We were moving recently and wanted to order 3 pizzas for friends who were helping us and the bill was over $75. Granted, they were thick pizzas, but wow - $75?"}
{"text":"Well, honestly, I felt this place was just OK. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was super dry and not really flavorful. I usually give high reviews but not this time. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since freshman year in high school (2000), it was our go to spot for half days. My husband and I walked in last night for a bite to eat and were greeted by cheerful, smiling hostess that sat us. Our waitress was young and also cheerful. We ordered a bakers dozen of wings, my husband got a pepper cheese steak sandwich and asked for extra cheese and explained that the last time he got it there was barely any cheese on it and was super dry, I ordered the chicken finger special (because I'm adulting like a pro). She brought out our drinks and after that nothing else seems to go right. 

Our waitress basically focused on the big table she had in her section and us and another family that sat went through long periods of zero contact with her. No refills. Unable to ask for anything. I had to grab ketchup from another table because she was nowhere to be found. Our wings came out and they were warm at best and the skin was uncooked and gelatinous. So gross.  We waited for 5 minutes for our waitress to come back and she never did so my husband took the basket and went up front where our waitress and the manager were too busy flirting and play fighting to actually make sure their patrons were happy. They both just stared at him before even bothering to respond. They took the wings and my husband returned. The waitress eventually made her way over with our actual meals and said she removed the wings off the bill for us. My husband looked at his sandwich and asked if they put extra cheese and there was barely any on it and whatever was on it was translucent and she said she told them and they put 2 slices on each half instead of the 1 they normally put and that she didn't charge us for the extra cheese. Uh, thanks I guess? His sandwich was dry and seriously I don't know in what world they thought that was extra cheese. He literally told her to tell them to pile it on lol I had to wait over 5 minutes for her to come back so I can get the barbecue sauce for my chicken fingers. 

Keep in mind we haven't had a refill this entire time. She finally brings my barbecue sauce and grabs my cup to refill it, completely ignoring my husbands empty cup. By this time we've been there for over a half hour and we're wondering where our wings are. My husband finally goes and finds the manager and asks him why the wings are taking so long and the guy told him he just assumed we didn't want wings anymore since my husband went back to sit at our table after initially telling them about the under cooked wings. My husband said it didn't make sense to make that assumption and the manager said \"so you DO want wings?\" my husband was irritated by this point and said of course he wanted the wings, why else would we have ordered them to begin with? We finished up eating our food and my husband is still waiting on his refill and I look over and watch our waitress sit down at a booth and chit chat with the guy that was sitting there. She didn't get up until ANOTHER waitress was walking around with our basket of wings looking for her to bring it to our table. She brings it, we ask for the check and to go boxes and that's when she grabs my husband cup to get it refilled.

Suffice to say, we won't be going here again. Other than the lovely girl that sat us and the waitress on the other side of the restaurant, the service was horrible. The manager didn't seem to know what he was doing and would much rather spend his time flirting with his young workers than actually doing his job and our waitress wanted to do everything BUT her job."}
{"text":"I remember going to the original location in the early 90's. Same scary decor, just a different location, Wanted to grab a few wings and get our 'fried' fix.  They are just o-kay. Nothing special whatsoever. It even looks like the wings are assorted sizes. Some are meatier and some just downright puny.  Our server said they are known for their philly cheesesteak sandwiches, so we got one to share. It was tasteless and as dry as the sahara desert.  The meat was shredded cardboard and the bun was straight out of the bag.  The cheesesteaks at Corleone's (a fast food joint) are light years better!

The only thing that's good are the onion rings...(MMMMmmm) and cheap beer, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Pretty cheap, and good value. They've got an extensive menu, so there's something for everyone.

The food didn't blow me away, but dollar for dollar you could do much worse."}
{"text":"I am a big eater. Also from the east coast. This is the closest you will get to a New England steak bomb. If you know what a steak bomb is, you know how hard it is to find a good one out here in AZ. Grinder shops are rare but Uncle Sams offers the best steak bomb I have had in Arizona. It is hot, chopped steak, melty american cheese, grilled onions and raw, peppers, mushrooms, and hot peppers. Get the WHOLE. It is about 16\" of steak and cheese. If it wasn't so expensive I would rate it higher. If you like to pig out this is a great place to do it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. As I entered. I informed the waitress that I was on my hour lunch break and I'd sit at the bar. After being seated for 10 minutes (literally no exaggeration) I was asked what I wanted to drink. I ordered a beer. I asked for a menu, she pointed me to the bailout menu with limited options. At this point she had walked off talking to other patrons. I was sitting there for an additional 15 minutes before she returned to give everyone at the bar free food except me. I know it was free because she stated someone placed a big order for the wrong location and cancelled it. Then again she is off to God knows where. I sit there for another 10 minutes (at this point I'm timing this because I'm waiting with nothing to do) she arrives asking me if I've decided. At this point half of my break is over and it's pointless to order. So I paid for my single beer $3.50 btw and left. No tip. Sorry 

Now, I love uncle sams and will most likely come back. But unfortunately I am now that guy who will ask for another server if provided with this young lady. 

Rant over"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 star reviews out, but Uncle Sams deserves it. I always order the half cheese steak with onions, and a side of mayo, ranch and sweet peppers. For a side I usually get either the fries, onion rings, mushrooms, or zuccini. But the fries satisfy me the most. Uncle Sams has the best cheese steak ive had, even better than all the places ive been too on the east coast and in philly."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Its a shame because we used to like it alot but it has steadily gone downhill before our eyes. The worst part is the greasy ass floor you slide around on as you walk in the restaurant. The food is ok unless they forget to take the saran wrap out of your sandwich which happend to me once, which was promplty replaced by the manager. Service? Hah. Most of the girls that serve there are sweet but our last visit was about 20min before closing and we were completely ignored by the waitresses and Ken the  manager. We headed over to Azpizza and had a great meal and a great time."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Sams! Their bailout menu is fabulous (a HUGE tray of fried zucchini or fried mushrooms for 3 bucks) and $5 pitchers during happy hour! I knocked a star off because one time they were super busy and didn't approach our table for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Mandie is awesome., if you want phenomenal service with great food come see mandie at the bar. She covered all of my needs promptly with a smile. This place wouldn't be the same without her."}
{"text":"Had Uncle Sam's cater a party for family and friends.  The six foot sub was awesome along with 5 different flavors of wings and an antipasto salad. It must have been good because there was nothing left. Thanks to Derek and Ken for their terrific job putting this together. We will definitely use them again."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my dads birthday. My parents and grandparents had arrived a little early considering it was a Friday night. Luckily they got in and seated right away. My husband and I arrived shortly thereafter. We waited what felt like an eternity for our waitress to even come and take our drink order (in reality it was probably 15 minutes) after that it was probably about another 10 minutes or so before she came back and took our order. It seemed her other tables took priority over us. We order mozzerella sticks for an appetizer and our meal all at the same time. However after waiting another 20 minutes we still didn't have our appetizer so we finally got our servers attention and asked her for them. She brought them out the same time they started bringing out everyone's food. They had everything all mixed up. I took a bit out of our appetizer and they were cold, the. I realized my husband I were missing our meals. I asked the server about it and she panicked and questioned what we ordered again. Finally they brought us our meals- which were wrong. I asked to speak with a manager. Another 10 minutes go by and we finally get our food, shortly after the \"manager\" comes out all in a fit anger with the server and completely abrupt and rude. He couldn't understand what happened (mind you he's angry with her not us) but I've never seen a manager so blatantly degrade one of their own employees to customers. I was quite shocked. At the end of talking he stated he was going to take certain items off our check and that was the end. My husbands dinner was still incorrect but he ate it because by this point everyone else had already eaten. I could tell my food had been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period because the ranch had a thick film on it and the wings were dry as a bone. Our second round of mozzerella sticks  were far better. Our sandwiches (despite my husbands still being wrong) were very good. But based on the way the manager treated his staff and how poorly we were treated, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Uncle SAMs is the best sports bar and food place you can go to in the area. Good beer and good food! Tv's everywhere and it's a nice environment. Bar girls are nice and the manager is cool. 5/5 hands down."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places, but the service has gone down hill. Today we stopped by for some quick wings at 2:15.  We did not leave until 3:15. We asked for our salad first but did not see the waitress for 15 minutes after we ordered. When I went to find her she said oh yeah. Then returned with a poorly made salad and the wings that were not done to our order. We waited 5 minutes and had no one come by so I walked to the kitchen to find the waitress. We waited another 15 minutes and the wings did come out right. We finished and had to wait for the bill. We got the bill and had to walk it to the bar to pay since she didn't return. When she rang it up she added $3 to the total prior to my tip and claimed she had accidentally added an ice tea after giving us the total without the tea on it. She also didn't return the receipt when she gave me the copy to sign thinking I wouldn't notice.  This all happened with not many other tables in the place. The manager did void the amount and reissue the first amount but just said oh well they make mistakes and walked away. I will miss Uncle Sam's and will not recommend it anymore."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Bad service, food is average at best. Totally processed everything."}
{"text":"In my opinion. Soggy pizza. Boneless wings seem smaller. 4 cheese sticks for $4.50. Been going here 8 yrs portions seem to shrink and  quality has gone down. Too bad, but plenty of competition for pizza in the area. Will go elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"High priced but MMMMmm, good hoagies and wings. Their pizza is also great.
Happy hour makes it a little more affordable, and coupons are usually in the mail.

The atmosphere at this location has funny U.S. themed posters etc. on the walls but the TV's, while several, are tiny and up really, REALLY high. In other words, don't go here if you expect to watch the game and eat.

The service at this location is sometimes 'hit' or 'miss' but usually adequate, and here's a tip from a regular, park in the back."}
{"text":"We came her a year ago and had a great experience. Today's visit was not the same. The wings tasted as if they were re heated up and rubbery. We had to ask for water refills. I would not recommend...."}
{"text":"I enjoy uncle sams, I was born and raised in the area and have been eating here since I started eating solid food. It's not the greatest food but the wings are pretty good. When you order togo it's hit or miss. Sometimes your food is perfect, and sometimes you get 12 drums and 1 wing with an order of wings. All in all its easy, ok price, and quick."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizzas, cheesesteaks, honey hot wings, and not to mention the excellent happy hour specials. My g/f dips her pizza in the honey hot wing sauce and boom game over its the bomb. Im almost here weekly if not bi-weekly to eat and have a drink. Cant go wrong with this place and it being 1/4 miles away from my home its a bonus.

This place would get a 5th star if it werent for how quiet this place can be which puts out a very uncomfortable vibe. I have been booted from this place twice during happy hour for being too loud and or cursing. They have a jukebox but nobody uses it and they usually dont play the audio from the TV's. When theres no music/tv audio on the place is a ghost town because everybody dining doesnt want to talk too loud to disrupt the silence."}
{"text":"Pizza is never fully cooked. Crust was super chewy and almost inedible. We ordered regular crust and were given what looked like thin crust or just some trash pizza they made. 100% done with this place. I keep given them chances to redeem but not anymore. Tailgaters , Barros, and cheezeheads will get our pizza money. 

Uncle Sams is hot garbage now."}
{"text":"Grew up going to US, since 1980....loved it...recently (past 5 years), food hasn't been so good and service started to stink. The past 3 times we have gone as a fam, the food STUNK and the service was even worst. 
I'm truly bummin about how bad it has gotten over there. They even had my Pop Warner team's pic on the wall from the early 80's. 
I hope they get new ownership or some major changes happen ASAP. Won't be around much longer with how things are going.
SAD."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times. I  once ordered their wings, 25 wings for like 16.95, but there were a few uncooked wings. 

It'd be nice if they could cook them longer."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the menu is not very extensive.  I predict cheese in your future in one form or another. If a cheese steak or hoagie/grinder or pizza sounds good, try it out.  

Someone told me there were decorations all over the walls.  I cannot confirm. But I do know that the waitresses wear cheer-leader style skirts.
[shrug]  Sorry. That part was 4 1/2 stars, though, just to keep this review thorough and comprehensive."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place three stars but I wish I could give it five. The food is amazing and very moderately priced...especially the honey hot bbq wings and pizzas (which we get everytime we come in). Last time we tried a cheesesteak and it was fantastic! Best I've had in a long time. The happy hour (5 dollars for a premium pitcher of blue moon or fat tire, or 4 dollar for domestic brews) cannot be beat anywhere in the valley. 

The only thing about this place that is not up to our standards is the service.

The girls they hire here are inexperianced, slow and sometimes down right rude. Most of the servers we have experianced forget major parts of our order or forget about our table altogether. Once we were even told \"we better hurry up and finish because we are closing in 15 minutes.\" We had just gotten our food! My friend who was dining with us that night had frid zuchinni that she was in the process of eating and one of the servers literally grabbed it out of her hands and started boxing it up...while she was trying to eat! I've never experianced that level of ignorance and downright rudeness while dining out...ever. and I'm usually prety forgiving being in the restaurant industry myself. The girls just have no clue! 

The food and great happy hour are sincerely the only things that keep us coming back again and again...although I wish it was an overall satisfaction."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is alright - but not for the food. I've had the french fries and Philly Cheese steak and was unimpressed by both. Not terrible food, but just really average. Some of the food is a bit expensive for what it is.

The happy hour goes from 3-7pm and 9 to close. One dollar domestic drafts and 1.25 for premium. They also have a happy hour menu, too. I'd recommend sitting at the bar for the best service."}
{"text":"The wings are a bit dry, but only a bit.  The wait staff is nice, the prices are middle of the road, and the beers are cold.
Why not 4 or 5 stars?  It's a bit dark, a bit old, and they need better and larger TV's for sports.
Other than that, it's a bit of old Arizona that manages o stay relevant."}
{"text":"Second worst experience with this restaurant. First time was two months ago and our pizza was so burnt we could not eat it but the waitress said it was normally like that. Today we tried it again and my daughter's cup had ranch residue in her cup like it had not been washed and the waitress never came back so she could get a new drink. She got a drink to go but we were charged for her drink twice as well as my son's juice twice. I was so furious, I just left the restauarnt than deal with crappy service. As we left the server Hayley knowing how crappy and disgusting our experience was meekly said, \"Sorry about the horrible dining experience.\" Never going back for crappy service, crappy food and above all the risk of food poisoning because they cannot wash their dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the hoagie grinder and my husband gets the chicken Parm. My sandwich normally makes a great lunch the next day, depending in how hungry I am. This is a Phoenix staple that everyone should try."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Wings are yummy and cheesesteak sandwiches are the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Every time I give this place a chance I'm reminded immediately why we and everyone we know HATeS this place. The service is terrible, it's like being in high school with a bunch of petty, gossipy little girls who say nasty things and know all their cuss words and think it's cool to use them as every other word.. They also enjoy talking about customers they've had during the night and if they got tipped in cash or credit card.... There was probably all the girls up at the bar BSing at one point tonight... Asking if one of the girls \"ripped ass\" very loudly... Throwing F-bombs out over and over.. It's terrible. I'm sitting here currently listening to them and their guy friends hanging out at the bar who are just as loud and obnoxious cussing and talking about nasty, vulgar things and cuss words are about every other word... I'm ready to get my food and get out of here.... Never again will I come back. 

Last time we were here it was also for take out because service is always terrible and super unprofessional... Tonight just took it to a whole-nother level.

Philly is good with extra cheese and mayo to make it creamier. That's what we order to go if we ever order from here which is about 1-2 a year now...  Only take out because of the service. You'd be better ordering ahead and picking up to avoid the service and convos that take place here. 

Management really needs to hire some quality people, it would turn this place around big time. But if they keep going, this location is going to fail big time.

Sad... It has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Top three wings in Phoenix. The wings are big and you'll have the option of getting them cooked extra. Do it! The wings keep crispy even after being sauced. The 'Honey Hot' sauce is killer. Sweet with a great after burn.

The pizza is also good. 'UNCLE SAM'S ORIGINAL' white pizza (Fresh tomato & real bacon) is very tasty. We had spinach and fresh garlic added. The pizza had a tasty, crisp crust and lots of toppings without being greasy. 

The steak sandwiches are also very good. I usually get the chicken version with the 'Honey Hot' sauce added for extra kick.

Beer is priced well and happy hour makes the price even better. 

Do not go to watch a game if you like a big screen. There are lots of TVs, but they are small and near the ceiling!! 

A good place for food and drinks and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of options...You got pizza, you got cheesesteaks, you got almost every kind of sub, you got salads and you got almost every bar food including wings.  I wouldn't say anything is the greatest but it is all pretty darn good and big portions...never order more than a half sandwich unless you plan on sharing!  Service is knocking on OK and I'm not a fan of the layout with the bar right where you walk in but the carryout service window is pretty clever.  Almost reminds me of a big city late night pickup window for the inebriated but it is not in the right part of the city to get fully utilized like that."}
{"text":"We have visited the Peoria location less than five times since they've opened.  Most recently about a week ago.  We live within walking distance so we thought it would be a great place for some yummy food.  Each time we have ordered from there, I vow to never go back but I keep thinking the lack of flavor and quality was a fluke.  I guess not.  The cheese steak sandwiches are tasteless and rubbery.  The onion rings have no flavor whatsoever.  I'm not sure how this is possible with access to wonderful recipes on the internet.  If you're looking for beer, I imagine it's as good a place as any.  If you're hungry for some good, tasty food, I suggest you plan on getting a meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"We really enjoy their sandwiches. Great price and the half is plenty for both mom and I. Hubby ate and enjoyed a whole half of the mushroom steak and cheese sandwich. It's a great place and the staff are always pleasant."}
{"text":"Recession \"bailout\" specials appear on the coupon fliers in the mail, but when you get there it doesn't look like such a deal.  The food is basically half of the portion of the normal size, with about half the price.  So you might feel good about a \"bailout\" special, such as mozzarella cheese sticks, but then when 4 little sticks arive with a disproportionately large side of marinara.... ah the lack of a deal is rather striking.  Think about this in other contexts, such as being seduced by a $5 burger special, which is really just a half-serving of a $10 burger.  See the letdown?

Beer bargains are the only real bargain there now, and that's during happy hour only.

Pizza can vary depending on who is making it.  Sometimes there seems to be less sauce than others, and it is somewhat bland.  I don't know why but to me the personal size is usually a better pizza than the larger ones."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks took them 2 hours to make r food and they still mess up the order asked for green pepper and grilled onions they miss all that and we ordered wings they never made they for us so I don't recommend this place not even for my enemies."}
{"text":"Went here per recommendation from a couple friends. Ordered the special grinder and was hoping for something special. Once I got home and took a bite, I was sorely disappointed with the seasoning. The sandwich was really bland and didn't taste like anything. Will try them one more time for their cheesesteakes, but will stop patronizing them after that. Real disappointment."}
{"text":"I went there tonight, but sadly this Scottsdale location is out of business."}
{"text":"I moved into the neighborhood and was looking forward to a good local pizza and hoagie spot...  this isn't it.  

I've given this place more than one opportunity to redeem itself, but each visit is worse than the last.  The food is sub-standard at best and the waitstaff, although 'sorry' can't/won't do anything to make it any better.

If you're hungry there are many other places to eat that won't leave you as disappointed as this place."}
{"text":"Since the departure of Taste of Philadelphia at 32nd and Camelback years ago this has been one of the only quality spots in Phoenix for a cheesesteak.  Personally, I've never ordered anything BUT a cheesesteak but my wife says the Uncle Sam's Special sandwich is awesome.  They have several locations, but I'm partial to the 32nd and Shea store for some reason.  It just has that slightly dingy feel that makes the steaks taste that much better.  The waitresses in knee socks and cheer skirts don't suck either.  Only thing missing is a full bar."}
{"text":"First time there and it wasn't too shabby. Thought it would be way worst but service was decent, wings were good and the fried zucchini was BOMB. I like the atmosphere, and the staff was nice. They have big booths which makes it comfortable to eat. Good happy hour prices too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I couldn't be more excited!  My wife is from Chicago and we go back to visit there from time to time.  Each time we do, we go to Portillo's.  I'm not a huge hot dog fan but I've never eaten a better dog.  My wife loves the Itallian Beef sandwiches there.  We've struggled here in AZ to find anything that compares like, Luke's and some other Chicago Style food joints but couldn't be more excited to have Portillo's in our own backyard.  Oh yea, you have to try the chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Uncle Sam's for probably 20+ years and I have always thought the food was well above average, that was until today.  My husband, son and I stopped in for lunch around 1:00.  I ordered 1/4 cheesesteak with a small fry, son ordered the kid's pepperoni pizza, husband ordered the 1/2 Italian sub. Server came over quickly and took our drink order, which was brought out within a bout 5 minutes. There were 3 other occupied tables, more staff than customers.  Finally getting our order my sandwich was ice cold, not even a smidge of heat. Husbands sandwich looked good, toppings fresh. Kids pizza was hot but really looked like the frozen Red Baron personal pizzas he eats at home, he didn't eat it.  Ate half of my husbands sandwich. For the 1st time in my life I sent my food back.  When the waitress brought out a replacement..with attitude, she had to inform us that she was a vegan and didn't touch meat...ever it was steaming and looked like a Uncle Sam's cheesesteak.  One bite told me otherwise.  The sandwich had absolutely no flavor, nothing.  No cheese taste, no onion taste. Meat was it, meat with no salt, no pepper.  Meat. I have loved this place for ever, I will probably give the Peoria location a chance since it's closer to our home, but Shea we won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. We grabbed lunch here last week... I got a meatball sub and my boyfriend Mike got the cheesesteak. The meatballs were flavorless. Mike said \"Its like eating bread on more bread\", so if bread is your thing there ya go. The cheesesteak was bland as well. If I order a cheesesteak I typically expect there to be cheese on it - not the case at Uncle Sams. 

If I were judging off this visit alone I would give 2 stars but I am not. I have been here in the past for pizza and wings. The wings were slightly above average and the pizza wasn't too bad so I am giving 3 stars. In the end I would say Uncle Sams is a good choice for happy hour specials but you can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to here to watch the cardinals game today.  This used to be a family establishment with good food.  However , the low lives sitting next to use seemed to think it was ok to yell the f word every other second.  Even when the waitress told them to take it down, they just ignored her.  A manager should have handled the situation and they should have been escorted out. I can't believe i chose this place over tailgaters up the street.  Never again will i step foot in that place.  Thats to bad, because I have been going to uncle same for over 20 years.  Bye Bye"}
