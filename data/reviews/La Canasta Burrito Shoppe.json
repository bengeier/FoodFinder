{"text":"Went back the next day with some work-friends and we all had machaca, 2 of us had chimis with rice/beans, and 1 had a burro.  Good chimi, lots of fresh guac on top.  The machaca was pretty good, maybe just a little on the salty side.  One of my friends suggested that it seemed it was cooked in chicken broth, but wasn't sure.  We all agreed that we'd put La Canasta into our regular rotation for lunch.  Service was excellent.  And again, the place looks sort of plain and freaky from the outside, but inside it's super clean."}
{"text":"Food is average. The hours are ridiculous! Its always closed????"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for 5 years now, mostly because it's just down the street from my job and it's basically the only Mexican Food that's close enough.  

As said before by another reviewer, this place lacks consistency.  Their food is a hit or miss.  My co-workers and I always say, \"Only order the burritos\".  And it's because their plates tend to be really expensive and they're really not all that good. It really seems that they try to save everything, and if it's not wrapped all together, then you are going to taste the refrigerator.

Another bad thing about this spot, is that their pricing is always wrong on their menus.  Literally!  Because they are in an industrial area, I can guess that their main clientelle are the people working in the surrounding office buildings and construction sites.  It is very hard to gather an office order when the people don't know how much their item really costs..."}
{"text":"I had to give 3 stars only because of the cost and portion size. The taste of the food was great. No complaints there. I ordered a red chile burro and 2 cheese enchiladas. Total was 15.00. I was a bit surprised. So I grabbed a menu. 4.99 each for a cheese enchilada. Holy cow! Thought to myself damn these better be good and served with lettuce and tomato. Nope! Came in a round tin container. It was fresh cause it was hot. I opened it up and was quiet disappointed. No lettuce, no tomato and very minimal enchilada sauce. The sides and top were a little burnt from being under the salamander too long. The size of them were not big enough to charge 4.99 each. My burro tasted great but there was more sauce than meat. Again. Great taste but lousy portion size for price."}
{"text":"Visited here to take lunch back to office. Angelica is awesome, and a great lady for customer service. Food is very good! Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"I just picked up a green chile burrito to eat and the office.  Opened up the container and I received a red chile burrito.  Not a big deal, I figured I would be fine until I bit into the first piece of meat which turned out to be fat.  After cutting a little further it was a big chunk of rock hard meat.  I don't ever throw food away but after two bites in the trash it went!"}
{"text":"So 8/27/15 I was looking for a burrito shop and googled such. Not paying attention to the time I arrive at La Casanta and Ricky the owner said he was closed. I asked if he could recommend another shop and offered to a make green chilli burrito for me. As he told me his family history and how the chain of restaurants came to be, I noticed other ingredients I asked for a burrito of such he made me 2 more burritos from his secret reserves. Even hooked up some chips and salsa. Ricky.... amazing burritos and salsa! My brother and friend and I enjoyed them well! Trust me guy we'll be back with more peeps in tow. Thank you for going the extra mile to make the burritos and welcoming me into your kitchen. Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! Order bean and cheese burrito and the cheese was not melted. Shredded beef taco was sloppy and greasy! Rice was soggy and no flavor! Worst Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Has the potential to be great but I've DEFINITELY had better. Will find another Mexican food joint near my office :/"}
{"text":"The food taste good but is over priced and got a carne asada burrito and it had lettuce lettuce in it  and was very small ....I'm not going back"}
{"text":"My coworker and I started a Taco Tuesday at our work several months ago, in which we started going to a different place for tacos every Tuesday. After find La Canasta, we have stopped going to any other restaurant and have been regulars here since. We've even gotten our group to expand recently and now at least five or six of us go every Tuesday. I highly suggest the taco combo for any taco lover."}
{"text":"While all the food here is awesome, the shrimp burrito is not to be missed. Tons of shrimp, made fresh. I have a hard time ordering anything else."}
{"text":"Knocking a star off because of consistency, and I have concerns about their food. I ordered a meal during lunch hour when things should be fresh and got obviously old and refrigerator tasting rice, which really turned me off.  Sometimes the food is great, sometimes it's old tasting, sometimes they get your order incorrect (more often than is acceptable).

Another issue is, my work semi frequently orders large orders for the entire office. They actually gave me a hard time once about getting sauce, and I only wanted enough for each meal we had bought. I figured if you order $100 worth of food at lunch, they should probably eagerly give you a sauce or 2 for each meal you paid for... but they actually tried to charge me. We mentioned that we had just placed a huge order, can't you include what we would normally get? The guy reluctantly agreed. If they are this stingy I have concerns over what they are using in the kitchen. 

Currently undecided about whether I will return."}
{"text":"Now that I have had two breakfast burrito's, I can honestly review this place again and say that the egg, bacon and potato burro's are quite good and reliable. The bacon is chopped into pieces and never fatty, there is no grease at all in any part of the burrito (usually on bottom), the eggs are well cooked and the red sauce (get two) really adds some gentle pop to the experience. The place blends into the industrial neighborhood, but there is one strange cardboard cutout in the parking lot consisting of a hot woman with a stroller which is bizzarre. Lots of other breakfast items here, but this burrito is in the rotation for breakfast every so often now. Not open on weekends..too bad because breakfast burrito's and AM football are a great combination."}
{"text":"Eat and you will see 8 )  The Shoppe Tacos are the Bomb & you can only get here!!!!
Mike will set you up..."}
{"text":"The first time we went, we called in the order and pick up was smooth. The nachos were great. Many of us at work tried to call in some orders again in the past couple weeks and the phone just rings and no voice mail or answers. We called before the lunch rush but between 6 people and several attempts, we gave up."}
{"text":"I'm amending my review - great food, poor customer service. Today, I was attempting to order & was put on hold immediately (no asking to hold, just hold). I waited 3 minutes before deciding to drive to the store (.5 mi away). I waited in line as I watched her help person after person, ignoring phone orders. When I got to the counter, I pointed out that I'd been on hold so long, it was faster to come down in person. She then snarked \"as you can see, we are very busy.. \" (again, 3 people. They were not busy). I responded with \"then I guess you no longer need my business\". I attempted to call & speak to the store manager, but she refused to put them on, citing she was the manager (she wasn't).

If you're in a lunch rush, skip this place. If you have time to kill & enjoy snarky counter clerks, by all means, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Classic Phoenix Sonoran Mexican food family recipies, well prepared and so tasty you can become addicted.  There are fewer and fewer family businesses like this in Phoenix. On my first visit I had the Green Chili Burro and Ground Beef Taco.  One of the best Green Chilis I ever had!  Tender chuncks of delicious beef  with an excellent flavor and the perfect heat, wrapped in a very fresh tortilla.   Saw on the menu that hotter chilis , both red and green are available, with \"Nana's\" style burritos.  My portion size was well above average.  Met the manager, and could tell he is committed to super quality and great customer service.  Plan on returning many times with my friends and family.  My only worry is I will eat too much and gain some weight. I have eaten at Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area since 1972.  This one is Highly Recomended!"}
{"text":"Was craving their salsa because it is one of the best. Lots of flavor and just the right heat. Their new location is great and easy to get to on 40th Street just south of University on the west side of 40th."}
{"text":"I love La Canasta. It is one of my favorites when I want to leave the office for lunch. I do miss the lower prices and the original crew from the University location. I post this review because I put in a phone order today and when I got there it seemed as if my order wasn't even submitted."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I go here EVERY Tuesday. The tacos are the best I have had by far. The chips and salsa are much better than most.  The service is friendly and always very quick. They now know our orders as soon as we walk in. Great place for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, you order like fast food but they bring you your order, you seat yourself wherever you like. The food was delicious...i had the red chili burro enchelada style with rice and beans, one of the best i have had! 

Stop by, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I gauge a Mexican food place I haven't been to by a red chile beef burrito (my favorite) on my first visit. Today, I had La Canasta's. La Canasta is the kind of burrito joint you'd expect in an industrial area: Ready for the lunch crowd, quick, easy, available to go. It lived up to all of that.

So did the Red Chile Beef burrito ($5.75). Medium spice to the stewed red sauce, tender cubes of beef (not shredded). I would do this again or recommend that the office gets burritos for lunch or breakfast sometime, which is what I'm going to try next, an egg & chorizo burrito!"}
{"text":"A very close friend of mine got me hooked to this place nearly 7 years ago, it is the best place for a GREAT mexican meal, whether it is breakfast or lunch during the work week.  Their salsa is to die for and i have not found another place that can compare!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Waste of $23.84!

I was recommended this place by a coworker, and I was excited to try it. I called and was put on hold for over 8 minutes. I hung up, dialed again and was greeting by a guy that was rushing my order and just sounded like he didn't want to be talking to me. I was trying to tell him I didn't want cheese on anything and had to tell him three times because of him rushing and not getting it correct. He was so awkward on the phone. Didn't tell me my wait time or my total. 

When I got my food, there was cheese on the chips AND guacamole. They fixed it and I went on my way. 

Finally able to eat my food and the beef in my tamales had lots of fat that looks goopy (imagine boogers! Gross right?) I ordered three and only had one and half. My stomach started hurting and I'm just hoping I won't get sick! I went to eat my chips and guacamole and there's a two inch blonde or white hair in my food!

I didn't even move on to my side of beans. I was too afraid of what I'd find in there!

What a waste. I'm still hungry too.

Oh, let me add too that there was a pest control work order on the counter where you pick up your order."}
{"text":"Not the best ever. Way too hot inside. AC only in the front and seems nothing else in the back but the homemade salsa that comes in the ketchup bottle was the best ever. Orchata was to die for. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Love the red and green chili burritos. Just make sure you get there before they close. They also started delivering."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today! BOMBERS!! I had the beef flautas and the meat was tender and oozing out the ends, the salsa was on point, my husband and I will definitely be returning!!

It was clean when we walked in and the line moved quickly. Also I thought the food was reasonably priced. They give you a number and bring your food out to you. All the food I saw coming out the kitchen looked ahhmazing! Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I'm glad it's close to my work. The food is decent, the service is fast and always friendly when I've gone. I've read some of the other reviews and although I've never called to place an order I've never been treated rude or anything like that. Exact opposite actually... Idk I am a regular... And plan to continue to be."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have a burrito.  Love the Carne Asada, it was made for me, no rice, just beans, carne asada and pico.  If you love Chipotle then you will probably hate this place because La Canasta does not include a salad inside your burrito like Chipotle does.  Shrimp burrito is amazing as well.  Something about the hot sauce keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! For a while I was going every morning to get Bacon Egg and Potato with no Cheese burrito. It got to the point they knew my order just based on the time I called in. I had to slow down to more like once a week though.. 

This is basically the same menu as filibertos, Frederico's, eriberto's, Julioberto's... take your pick. But!! Two things set it apart, the service and the damn hot sauce! I don't know what they do different about that sauce.. but damn it is soooo good! 
The only two things I would change is:
Add a Verde Sauce &
Make bigger sauces. Takes me 4 to get through the burrito conservatively."}
{"text":"This is an amazing hidden gem. Their Mexican food, especially in the mornings is fantastic.  The people are friendly. The inside of the place is pretty casual. 
    The chicken enchiladas and green corn tamales are the best.  I wish they would get rid of their \"Jesus loves you\" uniform T-shirts. 
  Other then that,  this place is great."}
{"text":"Mostly meat covered with lots of shredded lettuce and bagged, preshredded, cheese. Where is the love?

Hot Sauce is pretty good."}
{"text":"First timer...and last timer. $8.90 for a 5 and 1/2 inch Carne Asada burrito that contained mostly wilted lettuce. What little meat that was in there was ok...just could have used more. A bag of chips to go that were probably over five weeks old...stale and tasteless. For that kind of money, I could have gone to Del Taco and get more food! Seriously, please avoid this place. Ricky Abril...if you're reading this.....shut this place down. You're just stealing people's money for this low grade 'food'. 

I hope I don't get diarrhea......"}
{"text":"this place takes 4 life and they give small burritos. I've gone to several canastas and none were this size. Won't go here again"}
{"text":"Not sure how long ago they moved but i went to the location on : 3202 South 40th Street, Phoenix, Arizona

* Barg's Red Cream Soda on the fountaiun !!!! Awesome = 1 star
* Machaca Chimi / Meat, excellent flavor well shredded with only one huge chunk,, = 1 star
* Machaca Chimi Tortilla barely crisped on the outisde only, inside doughy from the meat = 0 star
* Machaca Chimi toppings, had a Dusting of cheese :-( = 0 Star
* Country Music in a mexican restaurant = -5 stars (minus 5)
* order or sit down, not clear on a line process to order or go seat yourself not well orchestrated = 0 stars
* CHIPS 1.50 ? Little tray of chips to munch while you wait, seriously 1.50 = 0 Star

If I go back i will try something else, but probably for TAKE OUT, so i dont leave all miserable from the depressing ass country music.
 
Conveinent, definitely not a place to go anywhere out of your way for. Price was reasonable"}
{"text":"This place was a big hit with my office! We placed a huge burrito order and they were able to accommodate on time and even cut all the burritos in half for us! 

Ricky really made it easy for us and helped us out! 

My office loved the burritos as well as the salsa! They said it was \"Bomb\"! 

Definitely going to be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I have tried a couple of things and they were all fantastic, but now I stick to getting a chimichanga filled with machaca because they have the best machaca I have ever had at a restaurant.  The place itself is a small hole in the wall type of place, but maintains a clean and friendly experience. 

Luckily this place is down the street from where I work, so whenever I want Mexican food, this is the only place I consider."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few days ago. My food order was incorrect but the customer service here was above and beyond. Upon ordering, they gave me a drink and chips on the house. I ordered thr Carne Asada soft taco plate and it was good except not what I was expecting. I was told it would have Pico but these had a bunch of lettuce. Not my favorite. The salsa is yummy too though!

When I sat down, the guy working the cashier came to make sure everything was good. Never received service like that at a little taco shop. Thanks for that!"}
{"text":"The quick and easy breakfast burrito (that I'm accustomed to getting at the old location) was anything but that yesterday morning when I went here to grab 4 burritos for co-workers and I.

It should have been a sign telling me to leave when I walked in and a woman was upset because she called in her order 20 mins prior and when she arrived they had not started it yet even though she was told on the phone it would be 10-15 mins.

Considering I was ordering for more than myself (didn't want to disappoint friends when they thought they were getting La Canasta and I showed up with a breakfast jack instead), I stayed.  

25+mins later my order was called out and I asked if I could have hot sauce please.  I was then told \"they in there\" so of course I looked and I found 2 small containers...for 4 burritos.  I'm close with my co-workers but not that close that we need to share 2 hot sauces for 4 burritos.  When I asked for me she told they charged for extra and then gave me two more (which I did not and would not have paid for).

I would give this a 1 star, but nonetheless...the food is still decent."}
{"text":"Although we never had the chance to eat here bases on the customer service we encountered over the phone I gave this place 1 star. Myself and my coworkers wanted to try this place because of the good reviews but once we tried to call in our order for pickup(since we only have 1/2 lunch) we we're hung up on twice and then when we finally had a live person on the phone they proceeded to give us a hard time for having a large order, then they kept yelling at my coworker asking her questions and wouldn't let her answer. She was so upset she finally just hung ! Note to the business owner teach your staff some customer service skills. I understand lunch time is busy but no need to yell at a customer who is bringing you business!!"}
