{"text":"When I moved into the area I noticed less commercial pizza places around and I liked that. Hence, I trickled down to the Broadway Pizza (Open late) and discovered I won't eat commercial chain pizza again.

There are few seats so I usually get my pizza to go or delivered. The sandwiches are good too.Don't let the outside and lack of inside seating deter you!"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price.. The pizza is the same over and over again.  The burger pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"I love their food however if they mess up your order they will not discount even a dollar or try to work with a dedicated customer"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 large pizzas and a strombolli from here yesterday and all 3 were delicious!  The ingredients all tasted fresh and the cheese is plentiful.  I was told 1 hour for delivery, but it showed up 10 minutes early brought by a courteous delivery driver.  I highly recommend ordering from here as I sure will be.  There are still menu items I need to try like calzones, subs and pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Great food in a not so great neighborhood, don't be scared away! 
Someone suggested this place after a tournament in Cleveland. A I was driving there, I thought, oh, great, I'm in a bad place. When we got there, the place was a total dive. Not a lot of seating and no charm. HOWEVER, as I pulled in I saw the owner carrying in boxes of fresh veggies. She told us that everything was fresh and home made. I had a side salad that was full of veggies, cheese and an amazing homemade dressing with the best homemade garlic roll I've ever had. The pizza was incredible! Fresh crust with lots of flavor, fresh toppings, cheesy yet not greasy. The flavor was amazing! I will definitely go here again. One thing that made me sad was that she said that they don't bother to spruce up the place because people destroy it. That is too bad. The owner was very nice and accommodating. They've been there 30 years, and you can taste why!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!!!! They have great food but they are so rude!!! And always in a hurry to take your order....."}
{"text":"The food here will blow you away. There are few places left that make so many ingredients fresh. My favorite is the fresh ground sausage. The dough and sauce are made fresh too, not canned frozen garbage you get at so many other places. 

Then there's the subs... The meatball sub. You must try the meatball sub. Thank me later"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!! Customer service TERRIBLE. I have a voicemail of them calling me a nigger! All because I asked them to cook my chicken WELL DONE!"}
