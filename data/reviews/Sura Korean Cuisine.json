{"text":"Passed by the intersection and spotted this restaurant last night. Thought of trying out at this restaurant for lunch. The restaurant is not big but is nicely decorated. As soon as I stepped into the restaurant, I was warmly greeted by the waitress. I ordered a seafood soup noodle. It came with a few side dishes, two deep fried dumplings and a bowl of rice. Although the side dishes are small, they are cold and refreshing. They went so well with the bowl of rice. The dumplings are crispy and the meat inside the dumplings are well marinated and tasted delicious. 

The bowl of seafood noodles came in bubbling hot. It has shrimps, octopus, clamps, small muscles, seaweed and onion in the noodle. The taste of the soup and the noodle is good. One item can feed two people sufficiently well. Right now, they are doing a promotion on openings special. By the way, I love the relaxing piano music the restaurant is playing."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and it has good prices, but it takes long for your food to finish cooking and get to your table."}
{"text":"Sura is located right on Hwy 7 and Kennedy Rd, where the old Lobster Salute used to be. I came here in a group of 6 for dinner on a Saturday night. Since Sura is new on the block, we weren't sure how packed it would be so we made reservation before hand. Lucky we did because the space is very small. I'd say not really ideal for big groups unless you can make reservations prior to going. 

Environment: Although the space is quite small but with their choice of minimalist decor, white washed wood planks and light coloured tables, the space feels airy and bright.

Service: no complaints here. Food didn't take long to serve. Servers were attentive and friendly.

Food: The star of the night was the Tower GamJa Jeongol ($35), which is a tower of thinly sliced pork slices on top of Pork Bone Soup cooked right on your table. We got the pork bone soup in mild but the broth was still flavourful. Pork bones were tender and the meat fell off the bones easily. We cooked the pork slices into the pork bone soup broth and they soaked in all the flavour from the broth. The only complaint here was that there wasn't enough broth in the end because of the constant boiling to cook the pork slices. The LA Kalbi ($23) was tender and tasty but I find the portion to be a bit small for the price. The seafood pancake was solid with lots of seafood in every bite. Budae Jjigae (pork stew with kimchi, sausage, dumplings and noodles) was delicious as well, not too sour and not too spicy. 

Another thing that impressed me was that they not only give you generous amount of the usual Banchan (side dishes), but miso soup and a mini bowl of congee for each person to start! And after all the savoury goodness, you also get a complimentary bottle of Yakult! It was a very satisfying meal and Sura hit all the right spot for me. I'd definitely come back again and recommend!"}
{"text":"It's honestly such a shame that it's so small; not inherently noticeable and unable to seat many, cause the food is honestly amazing. While Markham is not known for its Korean food the same way North York and Thornhill, Sura is a true contender for one of the better Korean restaurants for the likes of pork bone soup and bulgogi. I was impressed from the start, the appetizers tasting far better than what you would expect from the small cold dishes that are produced in mass that we are typically accustomed to in terms of Korean appetizers. As for the main meal, the pork bone soup had tons of pork bone with the meat falling off, showing off how tender the bone was. The flavour of the soup was great as well; not too spicy, with just the right amount of seasoning. Overall, the service was great and the food was as well! Would recommend maybe making reservations as the small establishment fills up quick, but for sure worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Small korean restaurant tucked awAy in this plaza beside ontario service. Food was mediocre and prices were relatively high compared to other korean restaurant."}
{"text":"My mom and I were deciding where to eat a late Sunday brunch and we remembered seeing the new Korean restaurant that opened up recently. We walked in and were seated immediately by the friendly and attentive waitress. I was impressed by the interior design of the restaurant, it was simplistic yet elevated by the white wooden tables/walls and pretty calligraphy, you can tell the appearance of the restaurant was well thought out and it also made it very easy to take aesthetic photos of the food.

The food items on the menu ranged from ($11-40), a bit higher than what I am used to spending on Korean food. I ordered the pork bone soup ($11) and my mom ordered the kimchi stew with pork ($11). Before our meals arrived, they gave us a selection of complimentary appetizers - congee, kimchi, broccoli, bean sprout, fish cakes and potato salad (a little sweet for my taste). They were so kind and refilled the appetizers once we finished them! I enjoyed the pork bone soup because it had the right amount of heat and salt, the potatoes were soft and the pork was tender, however I felt like the soup could have used more time absorbing the flavors of the pork. My mom enjoyed the broth of the kimchi stew and would recommend this dish! 

I am happy to see Sura adding to the mix of diverse Asian cuisines in Markham and looking forward to trying their cold noodles during the upcoming hot weather!"}
{"text":"A newly opened Korean restaurant in Markham.  Very cozy place with lots of Korean menus.  As you can also see from the pictures, the food decoration is also great."}
{"text":"Came here with the gf on a week day for lunch. It's nice having a Korean restaurant on this side of town - a welcomed addition to the sea of Chinese restaurants in this area. There is not much seating, and so I would imagine you might have to wait for a table during peak hours.

I ordered the gamjatang ($8.50 - grand opening special) and my gf ordered the bibimbap (~$11). Both dishes were good! I'd say on par for Korean restaurants.

Where Sura really shines is its service and aesthetics. The servers were really nice and the lady owner (I think?) was especially friendly and welcoming with a smile on her face. The aesthetics are also much better than the average Korean restaurant. From the actual tables to the presentation of the food, Sura really stepped their game up.

Def. try this new place out, especially if you want Korean and don't want to venture to FMP and beyond just to get your fix."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Went for dinner and when we walked in, all 3 servers look over after the door slams behind us but none stop to welcome us. I went up to the counter, where they glanced over again and continued on. Even ignored me when I tried to ask politely for a table. Despite there being smaller empty tables, they decide to seat a bigger party first so we all had to wait. When we finally got a table, I sat down only to find the seat was wet! I wasn't even offered napkins to clean off. Perhaps they are new and inexperienced, but all of these issues really turned me off. 

Their side dishes are plated pretty nicely, though I'm not a fan of their kimchi. I thought it was a little bitter and over fermented. However, I noticed some tables got an extra plate of potatoes while other tables did not, which really confused me.

Food wise, it was mediocre. We ordered a pork bone soup and spicy rice cakes. Pork bone soup base could be more flavourful and meat could be more tender. For the rice cakes, they were decent... Sauce wasn't super thick so it tasted like it should. Prices are a little high for what it is. 

Overall, for such plain food and inattentive service, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I noticed a few weeks ago that a new Korean restaurant opened up in the Service Ontario plaza in Unionville, in the space formerly occupied by the lobster sandwich place. The bright sunny well lit space with white-washed wood paneling on the walls and tables lends a very contemporary feel to the space. The place is cozy and seats up to 18 people.

I ordered the pork bone soup ($8.99 for opening special) and the bulgogi dupbap, which is on special during the weekday lunch time frame (11am-3pm). The soup was mildly spicy and had 3 decent sized moderately meaty pieces of pork bone. The bulgogi was sweet, savoury and tasty. The banchan dishes included sautéed spinach, sautéed bean sprouts and tofu, which were nicely presented. The bill is accompanied by a little probiotic drink (like Yakult) for dessert which hubby was quite excited about.

The reason for the lower rating is the higher price point for most menu items. Many dishes range from $11-$20. Larger dishes can be as pricey as $40 but these are meant for sharing between 2-3 people. Location wise it's close to me so we will definitely be back. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"A new Korean place opened up in the unionville area near Black Bear Restaurant and I had to check it out! 
The inside is not your typical korean restauarnt feel but instead like an aesthetic brunch place. I love the side dishes we got and my bibibamp  was amazing too! Cherry on top of the meal they give you those mini drinkable asian yogurt at the end."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in a modest looking strip mall, sharing a common with a Chinese restaurant that has been here forever.

That's where the similarities end. 

Sura has a clean decor with big white wooden planks adorning most walls and a big chalkboard along one wall. A green, faux grass carpet in front of the counter is really the only significant splash of colour. It's trendy in an \"I watch HGTV religiously\" sort of way. 

The food is good, but it's the little touches that distinguish Sura. From the complimentary Korean-style congee served in small little cups to the Yakult-style dessert drink as you pay your bill. Even the usual Korean appetizers were presented slightly nicer than usual. Missing: the ice. They ran out that day. Opening week, so let's give them a mulligan on that. 

The staff is very attentive. Though, in fairness, the space is so small that you have to work really hard to ignore someone. That said, dozens of Chinese restaurants along Hwy 7 manage to do so on a regular basis, so it's nice to have someone offering to refill your tea several times in a meal. 

The small floor space also means that the restaurant fills up quickly. We came at 5:30 on a Saturday and Sura was empty. By 6 they had filled up. 

The food is good and the prices are comparable to other Korean restaurants. Portion sizes seem smaller. \"Non-spicy\" should be understood to mean \"a little spicy\". Odd menu quirk - pricing is the same regardless of the protein. So the pan fried udon costs the same whether you go with chicken, vegetables or seafood."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Small restaurant with around 5 - 6 tables. It was all full when we got there so we waited around 15-20 min before we got a table. After we ordered, we got free fried dumplings, a small bowl of porridge and some Korean side dishes, which is a lot of free food even before we got our order! I ordered the $8.99 Pork bone special. Thought the pork could be more tender and the soup base more flavourful. I personally prefer the pork bone soup from the more famous chain. Might give this restaurant another try and order the bigger hot table dishes for sharing."}
{"text":"We came here because the restaurant recently opened. The actual location is quite small and I guess you could call it cozy. The decisions don't really match the Korean restaurant vibe but it's very modern. 

The food. We were going to order pork bone soup but then we noticed the special meat tower pork bone soup.  The wait time was reasonable. The soup comes in a hot pot and a portable stove. Unfortunately because of the small table, the soup bubbled out and splashed all around the table. The soup is lighter than most other Korean restaurant that I've been to but still has good flavor. The pork bone was tender but lacked the soups spice (because of how light it was). The meat that came with the tower was frozen fatty beef (I think). It was still frozen when served. We cooked it in the soup and I must say, the meat was delicious. It was almost creamy and smooth, like it slides down your throat after you take a bite. We got 3/4 of a single potato in the soup though, which was really disappointing. It was also not cut very well as the centre of it still had the raw crunchiness to it.

There's wifi and the service was nice. The owner was very polite and answered all the questions we asked. 

P.s. msg flavoring :("}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about the place. It's newly renovated, the manager/owners working, the price is above average. I would say portion for somethings are small. It's a good addition to Markham. 

Though I'm torn if I want to go here or to first Markham place, since the place is so tiny and there is a high chance of waiting in line 

Probably seat 24 seats 

Bad for large groups 6 or more. Mostly 2 and 4 tops"}
{"text":"I came her on a weekday night for dinner. One of the servers informed us it would be a 15-minute wait for the next table (there is limited seating here!). We decided to wait, about 10 minutes into the wait, the manager (owner?) apologized for the wait and gave us a plate of their fried gyoza to have until a table was ready. Usually restaurants just leave you alone but they took the time to appreciate our business. The service is efficient and friendly. I really wish they had more seating, 18 seats aren't enough for rush hour.

Four banchan are served: kimchi, fish cake, bean sprouts, and seaweed. I ordered the bulgogi, which comes with rice and miso soup ($15+tax and tip). The dish arrives hot in a sizzling plate. The beef is tender and a lot of veggies are added to the dish. It's seasoned well, but more sauce could've been added, to go with the rice. You get great value from this restaurant and will not leave hungry. I'll be back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new Korean restaurant in the area. The decor is a little bit like a cafe more than a restaurant, which is refreshing. The service is good and the staff are friendly and attentive. The food while nicely presented was under-seasoned. The spice level is also much less than what you would get at other Korean restaurants, which may be a draw for those who can't take a lot of heat, but not so good for others who may find the soups too bland. Overall a nice addition to the area and will be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Lacks richness in their broth.

This new Korean restaurant is quite cute, modern, and aesthetic (i love the white wooden tables), but seems to miss that warm and cozy atmosphere most Korean restaurants have.
The staff are very nice, friendly, and most importantly responsive. The server took attention to replace the side dishes and refill our water quite often. Also, she brought us some mini yoghurt drinks (similar to yakult) to the end of our meal :)

I ordered the soontofu ($11), my brother the gamjatang ($11), and my aunt the bulgogi lunch special ($11).
There just isn't anything special about the taste that makes me really want to return.

However, I was quite interested in the pork bone soup tower which I haven't seen at other Korean restaurants. I'm sure to return at least once to try this dish!"}
{"text":"My friend had called to make a reservation for a Saturday evening and was told that was not possible. I got there first and asked about a waitlist system and was told that there wasn't one. The staff just try to remember what order customers arrive and would like a table. It was fine until the lady, that I think is the manager, wanted to seat a group of people who came after I did. Good thing one of the servers told her that I got there before they did.

Since it was so busy we were given a table normally for 2 to accommodate 3 people. My friend and I sat beside each other on the bench while the other friend sat across from us. The table could really only hold the hot pot stove for the pork tower, side dishes and our bowls. We wanted to order more food but were unable to with the small table and the manager hovering and waiting for us to leave. 

I had read a few reviews to beware of the soup bubbling over in the pot and my friends noticed a few new spots of their tops. The food was good but on the pricier side."}
