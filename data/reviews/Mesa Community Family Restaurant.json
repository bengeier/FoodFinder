{"text":"The new owners previously had a Chinese restaurant in Florence, AZ and recently took over this location. The other was our favorite place to eat because of the delicious food and friendly, excellent service. The Mesa site also has  traditional American fare for breakfast and lunch. They have the same Chinese menu that they had in Florence. We ate off the Chinese menu and as usual we were not disappointed. The restaurant name is deceiving, and the building and inside decor are plain. I hope others will try this place because of the good Chinese cooking. We won't come as often as we went to the old site because it's 60 miles from us, but whenever we come up to Mesa/Phoenix area we will definitely visit here."}
{"text":"I'm a biscuits and gravy type of girl and their Gravy Boat never disappoints me!!! I come here with my mom, and my daughter. (Toddler friendly)"}
{"text":"Went here again because we live right next door.  Again it was awful.  Our waitress was nice enough but kept getting things wrong and forgetting them.
My hamburger was ok, great size but super dry.
Husbands corned beef hash was disgusting.  Mushy dog food consistency, slimy, flavorless.  Can't believe they served it.
Cheap ass cheese on grilled cheese.  
This place is dirty and gross.
  I'm done here."}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership, but the food items have stayed the same.  They have added a full Chinese menu.  I have tried many of the Chinese entrees.  My favorite, by far, is the General Tso Chicken.  Anything that they have on the Chinese menu that is spicy can be made without the spicy.  That's how I roll with the General Tso's.

If you go there, you must get an egg roll.  Hade-made on the premises.  Best egg roll I have ever eaten.  They are so good, I tell random strangers to try them, and then the strangers tell me to try them the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch every once in a while.. Its basically what you'd expect from a diner type restaurant in this part of town.  The food has always been good for what it is.. The service has always been good, and the prices are pretty good.  Its not 5 star dining by any means, but for what it is, its good.  They have improved the decor since management has changed.  Still not fancy or anything, but its not terrible.  Last few times I've gone in there they've kept it on CMT on the TV.. which I'm not a big fan of... But at least they have something on.  Anyway, I like it for the most part.. I'll have to stop in for breakfast of the fish fry sometime.."}
{"text":"I will never return to this place! The service was horrible the waitress was beyond rude and when I expressed to her the fact that I had never had such poor service and that I would not be returning she told me that that was fine...
She NEVER refilled my ice tea and when she filled my husbands she had an attitude. We went for the Friday fish fry. The family has been going for years. The food was cold when we got it and we had to wait 15 minutes for a fresh plate of fish. I guess that is one way to keep the customers  from eating to much of the all you can eat fish! The place was not busy so I can't place blame on that. She just didn't care!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very good but the portions were tiny and the eggs were over cooked the potatoes were not done, don't think I will be back left hungry ..."}
{"text":"I wanted a traditional breakfast, and this is the place to come. The owner and waitress were nice."}
{"text":"I don't know why the other reviewer only gave this place one star after basically saying she likes it.  Today was the second time I've been here and both times it was perfectly good.  I've had good food and good service, the tables are clean, the atmosphere is very interesting with old photos of actors all over the walls.  The pictures are not \"random\" but follow an old movies theme.  

I don't remember what I had before (last summer) and don't see a picture on file so I probably forgot to take one.  I think I had fried chicken.  Whatever it was it was good, I remember that.  Today I got a lunch special of ham salad sandwich, something you don't find most places, with soup and coleslaw. The split pea soup was wonderful, not too salty like many places, so thick you could eat it with a fork, and full of chunks of ham.  The ham salad was meaty and tender with just the right amount of mayo.  The coleslaw had good flavor, too.  

The waitress was attentive and I picked up a real atmosphere of cheerfulness and comradery listening to the waitresses and cooks talking with each other.  I didn't feel rushed either and was able to post my pics and write this review after finishing my lunch.  Now that they are open later (winters hours) I will try and get back before I leave town.

12/17/10 Mini-update: I finally remembered it was catfish I had my first time here and it was very good.  My most recent visit I had a dinner special (they always have several) of chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans and Veggie cabbage soup.  All were very good.  Their soups are homemade and you can tell by the rich broth.  

One con:  I tried to come here a couple of nights ago and even though I was told they are open till 8:30pm in the winter, backed up by the sign outside, at 8:05pm they were closed with the door locked.  Me disappointed.  Especially since the first place I tried to go to was out of business, as was the place I tried after this one and I was on my fourth restaurant before I found a place to eat."}
{"text":"Good food! Dark, a little cramped, in the atmosphere department! Older, so booths, chairs, tables all have seen better days!"}
{"text":"Food and Service wad  very good.  I had the lunch special 1/2 lasagne 1/2 spaghetti with salad and garlic bread.

Atmosphere:  Carpet stained and old. 

Nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been lots of times because the food is good, the restaurant is comfortable, and it's a locally owned business. On one occasion we were actually given the wrong food twice. Today as we waited and watched our eggs get cold we decided this is the lady time. I've never felt so unwelcome in a public establishment. Our server wasn't just unfriendly she was rude. If they had been busy when we got there I could see hurried service but when we got there there were 3 servers and 4 occupied tables. She was just plain rude. We thought it was us but she was rude to the other customers too. The food was okay for cold and over easy eggs are not meant to sit that long but the service was terrible. The lost long term customers today."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with the Mesa Community Restaurant. I love the decor and the owner, Spiro. But I just hate the food.

It's a free-standing building just off Country Club, with parking on the street or beside/behind the building. Parking is never an issue. Inside, you'll find every color imaginable, with a heavy dose of teal. The plexi windows that enclosed the old smoking room have painted on Christmas decorations even in July, and there is an assortment of random photographs and prints on the walls.

The food is Denny's or worse. Pastas are watery, burgers are uninspired, and hashbrowns are underdone. It's never that busy here, not that I'm surprised.

The wait staff here is not great. I like to sit at the counter and watch people, and I've actually seen a waitress grab a handful of ice from the ice chest and drop it into a glass for a customer (right under the use the scoop or get fired sign!).

But Spiro's a gem. If you decide to stop in, be sure to spend a few minutes chatting with him. Just don't get your hopes up with the food."}
{"text":"Back to this reliable standby... the fish and chips vaulted to the top of our list..they are flavorful crispety but tender and flaky inside. (Ask for extra crispy fries and fish) 
They were out of soup so we each got a simple salad it was super fresh and hit the spot. The thousand island was a-ok.. like old throwback diner style. Extra touch like fresh cut tomatoes and cucumber chunkies made me feel at home.

Give this place a try dont be pretentious or arrogant..they are trying to make a go and i have yet to be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Old spot, I mean REALLY old, still having that look like time stood still here since the '70s.  The decor (including the lifesized cardboard John Wayne) is super rustic.

The food is truly home-cookin'.  There's nothing fancy about it really at all but it will fill you up nice.  You kind of get the feeling like someone's mom cooked it up just for you right there.

It's decent--with a surprisingly large selection of food from burgers to Mexican to fish to breakfast available anytime.  Nice service.

If you're driving down the road, and you're looking this spot up to see if it's any good, you can rest assured from me that it's fine for you or your family.  

Nothing's wrong with a good, cheap bite--if you are of the same mind, you'd like this place too."}
