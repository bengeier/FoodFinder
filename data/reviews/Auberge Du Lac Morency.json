{"text":"Very nice French restaurant.  Many locally sourced ingredients, baked goods made on site.  Some unusual dishes (always changing), like the deer main course that I enjoyed.  Friendly, efficient service.  The wait staff is very knowledgeable about the dishes, and the chef will probably visit your table.  Multi-lingual staff, the chef was discussing dishes in Portuguese with the party at the next table.  Extensive wine list, with great suggestions from staff.  Beautiful setting, right at the edge of Lac Morency, with a beaver swimming nearby."}

{"text":"The restaurant within Auberge du Lac Morency - this is a gem in the North. Where many restaurants come and go with the seasons, Chez Hippolyte (named after the town itself) holds true to it's name. It represents perhaps the greatest place to eat in the area. 

It truly is an experience eating at the restaurant. It's warm, it's inviting, it's traditional - there so few places left like this. With friendly service, unpretentious, a sommelier on staff, you really feel spoiled - but the flip side isn't seen on the bill. Prices are very respectable if not cheap for what you're getting. 

To begin with, the produce is fantastic. Most ingredients are locally sourced, boasting the richness of the numerous farms in the area, and Canadian French cuisine. The execution of the meals are nothing short of perfection. The menu itself is adventurous, with pheasant, rabbit, deer, ostrich, and so on. The flavours are deep and memorable. 

The best part is this place is here to stay - connected to the resort, it can suffer the ups and downs of tourism seasons, whereas most in the area have been unable to."}
