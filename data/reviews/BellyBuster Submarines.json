{"text":"I really wish more sub joints offered a Medium size (a la Quiznos) because a 6\" just wasn't enough to fill me up.   It is as others have mentioned, very \"Mr. Sub\" but on a much higher level of quality. The bread and cheese are the only items that are similar, the bacon truly is the best in it's field. Every other sandwich spot has typical microwave bacon that offers no texture once in the sammy. Here they have somehow managed to pre-cook crispy bacon and maintain it's crunch after nuking.   I'll be back, typically when I'm not super hungry (doesn't happen that often though)."}
{"text":"This is a new location of the Belly Busters on Yonge Street. The food tastes the same and the service is worse. Oh my gosh the person behind the counter could not have been more rude. I have never in my life felt more unwelcome getting food. She was on her phone when we first walked in and we just stood there until she got off her phone and just stared at us. I told her what I wanted and she mumbled what size I had to say pardon and she said it in the exact same mumble. It's a good thing my partner heard her. Her behaviour was very similar to a 16 year old girl giving her parents a really hard time. Unbelievable, you'd have to experience it to believe it. I took 2 bites of my sub and walked out I felt so uncomfortable siting there. I felt like she was glaring at me to get out of there. I walked down the street and ate my food.   Anyways I still love Belly Busters because the bacon is amazing and thick. The quality at this location is the same as the Yonge Street location. I think I'm going to avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"If I could base my review on the Sandwich alone this place would be a 5/5.... it is a delicious sandwich however....   1.  Staff - \"Surly\" is the best way to describe everyone who works there.  I've been there 3 times now and have never seen anyone on staff crack so much as a smile.  They don't seem to be able to acknowledge you verbally.  They just stare at you blankly until you become uncomfortable enough to blurt out your order.  You then step to the left \"Soup Nazi Style\".  Following your sub along adding toppings as you go.    2.  Restaurant layout - You order at the back of the restaurant right by doors that lead to the restrooms.  When patrons have to use the restroom they have to work their way back through the order line to get to the bathroom.  Just a horrible design.  3.  Bread (2 choices white and whole wheat)  Toppings - Not as many to choose from as Subway but they have everything I like.  Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Hot Peppers Onions, Olives etc.  4.  Speed - The most they can fit behind the counter seems to be three \"Surly's\" at a time If you get there between Noon and 1:00pm be prepared to wait.  Straight up, the Surly's don't move that fast.  I try and go after 1:00pm as the line up is considerably smaller.  5.  Cash only - Boooooooooooo.... you only find this out after you've ordered.  There are signs in front of the toppings. I'm guessing this place was set up on a shoestring - It looks like their cash register is an iPad, so I guess an Interac Machine was just too much to ask.   Okay... now here's the thing.  I keep returning.... Like 3 times in 2 weeks... I deal with the \"Surly's\", the poor restaurant design, and the fact I have to hit a bank machine specifically to get lunch.  Why????  They make one hell of a sub.   It is seriously delicious. It all just comes together... the bread is great, the toppings fresh and lots of em and the Bacon... mmmmmm BACON.  They could b 5/5 even if they fixed a couple of the above points...  Still, I highly recommend to my friends who are not \"princesses\" or easily offended."}
{"text":"This place is like walking into Subway circa 1993. Want interesting ingredients? Too bad. Want any kind of different bread besides white or whole wheat? Too bad. The sandwich (assorted) was fine and the service was friendly, but in downtown Toronto there are so many more options to choose from.  Totally underwhelming and not as cheap as you would expect for how basic it was."}
{"text":"I usually get the BellyBuster or Turkey Bacon subs here; both are delicious for a sub. It's similar in price to subways/quizno's if not a bit more, but it definitely tastes more fresh -- its probably the bread.  Its sub after all so nothing to rave about, but definitely a top option during lunch time when craving a sub."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed. Heard great things about this place, but it definitely didn't deliver.  I could've made a better sandwich at home :( Staff were friendly though."}
{"text":"Things you shouldn't have to put up with when ordering \"fast\" food.  1. Poor floor design that means a line up of ten people puts you outside the door.  2. Waiting 20 minutes in line to get in the door and find out you have another 15 minutes to wait.  3. Waiting 35 minutes to find out the place only takes cash and has a bank machine in the rear so you can pay them an extra few dollars for the privilege of paying them.  4. Finally sorting all of that out then biting into your sandwich and realizing you could have gotten something just as good two blocks away for the same price in five minutes.  I'll say this, the prices are good and you get a decent amount of food but there's nothing here to bring people back save the novelty of it being a new place.  Save yourself some time and get a sandwich almost anywhere else in the neighbourhood. Or if you really really really really like Mr. Sub then go to a Mr. Sub. These guys source most of their toppings and buns from the same supplier so their subs taste exactly the same anyway."}
{"text":"I don't get these 'meh' reviews. What do you expect from a place called Belly Busters? I hit there at lunchtime earlier this week and found the staff to be pleasant, accommodating and the sandwich to be good though certainly not artisan or gourmet. And true to its name, no way could I finish the belly buster in one sitting - and that's after passing on the gravy. True I could see it getting busy since it's the size of a hall closet and there's only room for one sandwich maker (not 'artist') , but it's like a wine you buy for Tuesday night: decent, nothing special but gets the job done."}
{"text":"Whenever a new lunch joint opens in the Entertainment District, you expect there to be much hype and long lines. There was definitely all that when I visited Belly Buster Submarines for the first time today. But you also expect it to live up to the hype, and for that I can honestly say that this place is a tragic missed opportunity.  -The food- I waited 20 minutes in line, which went back to the door. I was excited when I saw the menu and photographs of the sandwiches (which I Googled prior), which showed a sandwich featuring what looked like smokey bacon, tender meat, and fresh bread. As I got further in line, I saw that they were microwaving the bacon. Huh? Yep, that's right. Bacon in the microwave. If I wanted to go to Mr. Sub, I would have gone to find a food court in the suburbs. I ended up ordering the \"Bacon Turkey Combo,\" which features bacon, turkey and ham on your choice of white or whole wheat (12\") bread, plus your traditional sub toppings like lettuce, tomato. pickle, hot pepper, sub sauce, etc. Again, nothing special here. Standard, mall-variety cold cuts, and again, microwaved bacon. I must say though that the veggies were super fresh, especially the shredded lettuce. As for the bread, it came out of a bag. Fresh, yes, but not baked on-site as I was led to believe. All in all, $7.95 is not bad for a 12\" sandwich in 2013 (and it was definitely loaded and filled me up), but absolutely nothing about the sandwich will make me remember it as anything different from Mr. Sub. I would love to see options like pulled pork, back bacon, maybe some in-house relish, and most of all I would love to see the microwaves replaced with a proper flat top. I would even pay a few bucks more for the sandwich if all that were to happen...  -The staff- Expectation of good, friendly staff is very high in this neighbourhood, and the staff could definitely be happier. They were also slow, exhibiting no rhythm and it looked like they had little experience in preparing sandwiches. Go to any Subway and you can tell those people read a training manual. At Belly Buster, there is much fumbling and lack of confidence in piling bacon on top of turkey. You can argue that all that matters is the food, but I don't know anyone who doesn't like service with a smile. With better staff I know my line time would have been cut in half.  -The restaurant-  Clean, simple, a little retro, the perfect look for sub sandwiches. Photos all over of customers smiling (and some retro photos) exhibiting the \"face of the satisfied\" tagline. I dig it. I'm not sure why, but they only take cash. There is an ATM on-site. Maybe the \"retro\" theme extends to bill payment, but in 2013 it's just annoying. Hopefully this is just temporary. It's a bit of a tacky move given they use an iPad for a cash register.  -Conclusion- Belly Buster is a bit of a mystery. It's attracting a lot of hype in the neighbourhood, and maybe that's a sign that it's finally time for submarine sandwiches to go trendy. Unfortunately, I think this is a missed opportunity. People at King & Spadina expect a lot, and this gives them very little. But maybe that's the point--Maybe Belly Buster is supposed to be a trip back to simplicity, and for that I applaud it. I just wish that something, anything, would set it apart from the Mr. Sub taste."}
{"text":"Love this franchise. I've been to all three locations and I must say I've never been disappointed. Don't go in expecting subway, this place always has fresh vegetables and bread and so many sauce options it's impossible to not love what you order.  Their secret subsauce is amazing definetly a must on any sandwich and it's not posted anywhere but they sell Avocado and parmesan cheese which you can have at no extra cost!   I usually get any one of their bacon subs because the bacon is phenomenal but my last visit I tried the cheese steak sub and I now have a new favorite! (Although next time I'm definetly adding bacon!)   The staff is super friendly we had a good laugh as she made my sub. There is one guy who barely smiles but he makes a good sub and she informed me he's not much of a talker anyway.   A little bit more pricey than the original location on yonge but it is King street so that's to be expected. Doesn't phase me, because what I'm getting is worth the price!"}
{"text":"stale bread  awful service  long line  overall incompetence  try at your peril"}
{"text":"SO slow and unorganized. They really need to have at least 1 experienced sub maker for every shift who's quick, capable and not so nervous!!! Have tried a couple times on off hours and each visit has been a 15 minute ordeal with barely anyone in line.  The veggies were super fresh, but the bread is soggy, almost wet. There were more toppings outside my wrapped sub than actually inside. Disaster.   I will be sticking with the original location. I guess they are still new but the training and service really needs to ramp up if they want to stick around at this location."}
{"text":"Love the original belly busters location so was very disappointed when I stopped in downtown at the new spot. Awful service by  couple of teenage dudes more interested in impressing each other with bro stories than taking my order."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hating going on in these reviews, thought I would defend the legendary Belly Buster Submarines...  Sure the new King Street location has its shortcomings: you pay first, the staff is slow, the hours are inconsistent, you have to ask for toppings already part of your sub (if I order a Belly Buster sub that comes with hot peppers and mushrooms, I shouldn't have to ask for them again when it comes time to select my toppings), and why on earth is there Sriracha sauce there?  But that's not what Bellys is about. It's not about fresh ingredients, new flavours, toasted bread or even good service.  Bellys is retro. It's comfort food. They do things different and we don't want them to change. It's a little bit unsanitary, but that's okay. You scoff at any sub that isn't a classic. A bacon combo, turkey bacon or a Belly Buster are really the only acceptable options (who on earth gets a pizza sub there?). You take pride in accumulating stamps on your loyalty card. You're there because you want your mayo applied with an oversized butter spreader, because the lettuce is thinly shredded and because you want the option of gravy.  Bellys feels like a high school reunion. When you're there with your friends, you reminisce. When you pass by Bellys, you have to stop in, maybe even get two subs. You like your sub wrapped in wax paper and a paper bag if it's to go, classic. You bring friends there and when they're inevitably unimpressed you tell them \"you don't know what you're talking about.\"  This is what Bellys is about."}
{"text":"I LOVE Belly Buster Subs - The best!  If I could make one small request/suggestion though, instead of chopping onions into the hunky squares could you pleaseeee slice them? So much nicer to eat a thin sliced raw onion than a chunk. Other than that minor thing - Keep the subs coming!"}
{"text":"It's a good sub but not made with the same love as the original belly buster. Subs are made sloppy and the bacon tastes different (I think it's because they just keep putting the same pile of bacon in the microwave - gross). 2 stars because its a good sub - but not as good as the original location.. Same ingredients, different love, and different sequence. The real, original belly busters goes \"sub sauce, mustard, mayo?\" And this one is random. Seems weird but it's a sub science or something that makes the original better.  No debit also takes them down a notch. Just because it worked at the original does not mean you should do it downtown trying to serve work folk with so many other options. It's really a pain in the ass to know that you have to pay $2 to the establishment, plus an extra $2 to my bank to get cash to buy a sub from your place. An $8 sub quickly cost me $12."}
{"text":"Working downtown Toronto I do enjoy going out and trying new places. I do work relatively 5 minutes away from the place and kept seeing it - so decided to give it a shot. The first weird impression is that the place was not updated since the 50s, even though I understand it is new. Extremely basic menu and little to no choice in terms of toppings/sauces etc. Decided to try one of their specials which was advertised as the best thing ever - this is when things got interesting: 1. The 12 inch bread simply doesn't look 12 inch. I think the length is fine, but somehow extremely slim - basically so slim that realistically not a lot of stuff fit in there.  2. The sub they had advertised as the next big thing was simply a collection of cold cuts and bacon. Kinda disappointed once I saw what they put on. But then again, I could say my bad - should've asked more questions. 3. Minimal options - I mean some lettuce and tomatoes... and that's it. Choice between basic mayo/mustard/ketchup. Nothing else. It felt like looking at my fridge contents when I was 19.  4. The bacon re-heating process was interesting. They had a pile ready-made and then put the entire plate to reheat in a dirty microwave, even though they only needed a few slices. I got some of the fresher stuff, but I wonder how the last few pieces taste like once they've been reheated like 15 times... 5. Final surprise - the small little sub I had was a resounding $13 - without a drink. I was upset and I had not even sat down yet. 6. While eating - little to no flavour - and a nightmare to eat. Given how slim the bread was, most of the stuff was falling off, ensuring that I ate the bread in one hand and the contents from the tray. Ended up leaving still hungry.  Finally - my buddy was just as upset as I was (small sub with few extras and expensive) and he almost wanted us to go to the food court and get a burrito or something. That's how bad it was. I understand their idea of keeping it more old-school and relying on fresher simpler ingredients - but at least adjust your prices accordingly and try diversifying every once in a while. Honestly, go to Subway/Quiznos/Mr. Sub or whatever other fast food place that offers subs and you will have a better experience..."}
{"text":"So with a name like Belly Buster, I was expecting a disgusting monster of a sandwich.  Greasy and bad enough to make you want to walk home instead of hopping on the subway at St. Andrew station.  This was not the case. I was surprised!  I wasn't sure what to order and I asked which sandwich is the most popular. The turkey and bacon is their top seller.  Now, I have to agree with all the others that the bacon was perfectly crispy. The turkey is deli-sliced and the veggies were all fresh. The sandwich was tasty and I liked how I didn't feel stuffed after finishing it. But, it wasn't a particularly memorable sandwich.   The whole wheat bun was okay, but I sort of like toasty bread. Also, there weren't a lot of toppings available.  Belly Buster serves up simple sandwiches. Even though I wouldn't consider Belly Buster a bust,  it's not top of my list for sandwich places."}
{"text":"Just started going here. There subs are nice if you know what a old fashioned/ traditional sub tastes like. I get the assorted on white and it's delicious. They service is good and prompt."}
{"text":"I Popped in for the first time to try out the Belly Buster sub in Thornhill.  Loved it.  The Bacon tasted so good.  The staff was super friendly and the sub was for sure one of the best that I ever had.  Will defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a 12 inch roast beef and salami. To  realize mid-eating it was supposed to be hot? Lots of toppings and meat but utterly tasteless. 2nd and last time I go to BellyBusters! 11 dollars  wasted. I threw quarter of it."}
{"text":"The 5 starts is based on rel atavism, not absolutism.  Is this actually 5/5 by itself? Nah. But considering the price, the location, and what you get, it hits a 5/5.  I don't agree with Stacey - I hate the white bread, and it was infinitely better than Subway (and I'll admit, I enjoy Subway). I had the philly cheesesteak, and the meat was also a lot better than Subway/Mr. Sub.  If you need to grab a quick sandwhich, this is a great option."}
{"text":"Stopped by a few times for lunch or pre / post drinks at Barhop next door. I generally prefer a sub vs. other fast-food joints. Not sure I could say it's notably better than the larger chains but it's definitely a nice change.    So far I tried: 1) Turkey Bacon - a few times, 2) Corned Beef and 3) Cheese. The bread is standard for a sub shop as are the various toppings. Prices in line with the competition.   The Turkey Bacon sub is my favourite. As mentioned by other Yelpers, the Bacon is excellent and perfectly crispy. Turkey and Bacon are the perfect combo for a sub.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Corned Beef sub - the smoked meat lacked the real smoked spice flavour. More like what you get a deli counter in a supermarket instead of an old school deli.    Based on my 4-5 visits, I would rank service as average. Never had a bad experience but never wowed either. It gets a little crazy at 2am when the bars close but makes for some fun people watching.  Belly Buster doesn't reinvent the sub by any means... but it's a viable option for sub lovers looking for a change from the standard Subway or Mr sub selections.  I will be back.  BK"}
{"text":"Whole wheat turkey and bacon sub.  Good bacon.  The full sub was a bit much for one person to finish in one sitting.  It was good, but really, it's just a sub."}
{"text":"Better than Subway in my opinion in terms of quality and portions. Besides that, it is a fairly average sub shop."}
{"text":"Belly busters makes what I consider to be a higher end supermarket sub, you know like the ones you pick up the deli section at Metro. Except, belly's bread isn't going to be ice cold from the refrigerator, since it's made fresh. There are lots of customizations, but no they don't do anything healthy and they can't make your sub into a salad. Sometimes you just need your guilt free carbs meat and cheese, and that's what belly's gets right. 5*s if I didn't know the ridiculously high calories in these delicious subs."}
{"text":"As a longtime denizen of the Yonge north location you can imagine my excitement at happening upon the downtown location! I was drawn in by the sidewalk sign: bacon - what more could you ask for? Staff v friendly. Guys were cute and funny like the guys I used to crush on in high school.  Offered me a free sub if I could find his pic on the wall - nice (didn't find it btw) Guy-clean tables. Guys behind counter singing along w How Soon Is Now (smile) I had a beer before I came in here on a Thursday after lunch so I'll be more forgiving than some other reviewers.  Sammich: Bacon combo on white 12 inch can't remember price prob 8 bones or something on par w north loc.  Ya bread not quite as fluffy fresh as the boys up north, also the finely shredded lettuce not quite as meticulous. I prefer crispier bacon. Still a good sammich. Not same as north but let them get their submarine sea legs.  I liked that I could pay w a card instead of cash.  If I return to this location, I'll ask for extra crispy bacon. Maybe just an off day w the bread and lettuce."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey bacon.  I would definitely rate them above Subway and Mr. Sub.  My only complaint was that the bread was not fresh--tasted more like day old.  I will try them again probably mid-week when they are most likely to have fresher bread.  Other than that I enjoyed the sandwich."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good so much but it's just not. The bread is dry and didn't taste fresh the couple of times I've visited. The meat is seemingly tasteless.  Extra star is for the staff who are really friendly.  Why is it so hard to find a good non-chain restaurant sub?"}
{"text":"It was late, and I was craving a sub... I ve always been super curious about the place, the signage looked kinda cool. I was expecting a little bit of a dirtbag sandwich based on previous reviews on yelp. Anywho, I ordered a 6inch pizza sub. BTW this was under \"HOT\" subs on the menu. It was cold and had some dirty ass salami on it. I was expecting warm and pepperoni and marinara....AH NO.  Secondly, yes I was hungry... a assorted sub. A lot of toppings were on the sub that I never ordered. I actually found that kind of comical. I was hungry and ate the stinky onion sub. It actually was not that bad.  Consensus- Cold, hot, wrong toppings...meh, it squashed my craving."}
{"text":"Bacon is top notch.  They were pretty friendly and pretty stoked on making me a sub.  Pickles rule my life.  Subway's bread is better.  Price is mad decent considering where it's located.  Get there early- those kids get PACKED just after 12pm."}
{"text":"Seems the staff here all hate their jobs.  It's the closest place for me to get a sandwich, so I pop in every now and then.    This is a far cry from the original location. The personality of the guys running it was half of the draw.  And if there was such a thing as professional sub makers, those guys are it.    There just isn't any love or even care at the downtown location.   They also don't seem to put the same amount of ingredients on the sandwich.     Go here if you are in a pinch.  Otherwise, there are many better options."}
{"text":"Making my way home after a night of concert hopping for Canadian Music Week, I decided to stop in for some late night eats. I'd generally heard good things about this place, including about what seems to be their trademark sub, the Turkey Bacon sub.  First thing to note, your options are minimal. 2 types of bread. 2 types of cheese. A mediocre selection of toppings. Lettuce is extremely thin shredded, and green peppers are cut into tiny pieces as well. One thing I'll admit, the turkey is a better quality than Subway, but it's cut so thin and only 3 slices that is was lacking in meaty content and flavour. Luckily the bacon made up for that in the meaty flavour department.  $11 for a 12 inch sub isn't an impressive offering, and really left me underwhelmed as my belly was far from busting over this plainly average sized sandwich.  Not sure I get the hype... I suppose that when you put yourself in an area with the ability of catering to drunk people, it's easier to get by without bringing something unique or even impressive to the table. And I suppose that applies to a lot of what you'll find on this stretch of King St now that I think of it."}
{"text":"Classic sub shop with a great pedigree. Friendly staff and fresh ingredients. The North Toronto shop was a late night favourite back in hi-school."}
{"text":"Ok so ya it's not as good as the original. As other reviews say, there just isn't as much love!! It's so true. The ingredients basically all taste the same but the placement was off center and the dude even put a double tomato on.... Also they only have bottled beverages! I need my can of nestea to go along with my sub!!!!! So sad. I hate bottled pop/water.   The absolute worst part though was that my friend ordered his sub and they completely forgot about him! PLUS he had ordered the spicy sausage but they told him it would take a while to prepare so he switched his order to a turkey bacon. The place wasn't even busy when we went in!! There were 5 of us, and then 2 people behind us in line with 3 people working there.  Also there were huge flies everywhere and the bacon was just sitting in a corner. I've been to the other location numerous times so I know what their bacon situation is but this place had their plates and plates of bacon curled up and all stacked I don't know it was weird especially considering that it  wasn't very busy at all."}
{"text":"This is my go to sub place. If you want a real, old fashioned, no bullshit sub. This is the spot. First time you go you won't think it's that special. Because it's just a regular sub. But over time it starts to make sense. Its big, meaty, bacony and delicious. I go often. I love bellys. A true staple."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time yesterday.  Been a long time customer of the original location.  Have to say, the bacon combo sub was not even a shade of any resemblance to the original.  From the stale bread, to the chunky lettuce (anyone who knows Bellys, knows they take the time to finely shred their lettuce), to the horribly undercooked and less tasty bacon (Perhaps he 20 year old microwaves really do make a difference).   The overall product was like eating an evil (and much lesser) twin.  Will never go back here again. Such a shame to degrade the original belly buster name.  If you want to try and enjoy what a real bellybuster sub should be, go to the original location."}
{"text":"I've only really eaten subs at either Subway and Mr.sub so I was really happy with how fresh the sub was. The bread was really fresh and had tons of toppings.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this place not sure subs can get that good, but if your in the neighborhood Belly Busters is an improvement on the chain sub restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been going to the original for 20+ years so was a bit surprised when I finally walked in to the downtown location.   Let's just I say that some of the best things have not translated. I only ever get a small bacon combo and did the same this time too.   +ve: bread is amazing, real mayo, great lettuce and very fresh. Overall a great sub and better than almost any you can find in Toronto, except from the original location.   -ve:  they changed the pickles, the ham and the bacon???!!!  Why?  The sub guy does not have the same technique or speed of the main team and generally made a messier, slower sub.   Give it a try but make sure to hit up the main location if you want the best!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have to say that I was disappointed. I think I might go as far to say that I would have enjoyed a sub at Subway more. The bread was cold, the meat was pretty bland and tasteless, and in general, nothing really stood out for me.  I guess that the one redeeming factor of BellyBuster is the fact that it's open very, very late. If you're looking for decent post-clubbing food, I guess BellyBuster would be a decent option."}
{"text":"After reading the yelp reviews of the original and still standing North York location, I made the easy decision to have a turkey and bacon sub. On a super fresh, nice and soft whole wheat bun, I bit into one of the most delicious and traditional, though basic, subs I've ever had.   Fresh bread: check.  Crispy bacon: check.  Extremely thin julienne lettuce: check, check, check.   I actually loved this sandwich because it was simple (mayo and mustard) and affordable. I was here for the media preview and the owners of the shop were extremely nice, making sure everyone was happy while publicists took polaroids of people enjoying their sammies and posted them on the back wall. This place has old timey photos from the original location that adds a nice charm to a new place. This combined with the old fashioned sandwiches should make for lots of instagrams.  So why only three stars you ask? Maybe it was because it was a preview, but the actual ordering of my sandwich was an awkward experience. I ordered but had no idea where to stand or which sammie was mine, and when the sandwich artists were making my sub I could barely hear what they were saying. It was almost as if they were talking in mumbles. I felt very put off by this, enough to reduce what would have been a 4-star review down to a 3. I'll definitely give this place another shot sometime in the future though, and shall adjust my review should I see fit.  Final thoughts: definitely worth it for the fresh subs and taste. A seat by the window looking out on King Street, or, even better, a spot on the front patio, should make you happy on a summer day."}
{"text":"I grew up a couple of blocks away from the original Belly's. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I was disappointed. The first thing I noticed were the prices, $8.25 for a bacon combo. Maybe I was expecting the prices from my childhood. The bread seemed very doughy/fluffy, which I don't remember from the original. Definitely better than other sub shops but nothing to write home about.  I was surprised at the cash only thing as well. At least get a square reader for the iPad and take credit cards.  If you are going to open a second location try to staff it with unique people. My buddies and I used to hit the original after a night at the bar. Hermes the original owner would stay open until 4AM just for us kids and always smile and take us with a grain of salt. I don't think he would be happy with this store."}
{"text":"Just ate here again last night (was hungry and passing through the area at 11:30pm on a Monday)...and I'm upgrading my review from three to a solid four stars. This time the turkey-bacon sub was PRO. Beautifully soft bread, great quality turkey, crispy bacon. I recommend getting it with 'the works' (lettuce, tomato, onion, green olives, hot peppers, mayo, mustard). Everything came together perfectly. The sub was freakin awesome! Plus they're open late daily (till 3am or something?) so that's also a huge bonus."}
{"text":"Tough call for this one.  Service was so-so, but guy was not impolite per se, he was just indifferent. After a bit of small talk he seemed to be a bit more friendly.  But it's really about the food. Thai Princess had told me why'd be slow that night due to a rush, so I picked up a sub instead. And this is what I mean by tough: the materials were good, the ingredients I mean, and it was kind of like the subs you'd get back in the day at Fat Alberts or a greasy pizza joint, but without the grease. I got the Turkey, Ham and Bacon sub on white. Pretty good, and I like the way they shredded the lettuce instead chunks of it. The guy who made it put together a pretty tidy sandwich to be quite honest, and the flavor was also good. But it was just so-so in the overall quality, and I was surprised the option to toast wasn't offered (although not entirely sure it isn't available). With the price of rent downtown I'm a bit surprised this place endures as their prices aren't that expensive.   Place is clean and well taken care of. It was good enough that I'd go back. A decent although underwhelming sandwich. And the drink selection is decent too. There is also a TV to keep you distracted while you eat  Overall a good sandwich joint!"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular here (1-2 times per week) until the younger staff memeber started an argument as to why I don't like her poor customer service whenever I m served by her. She proceeded to roll her eyes as I explained that I dont appreciate her snappy attitude. I referenced the other staff members standing by, stating they're super friendly and have always provided great service. Attitude employee shrugged her shoulders and I said 'I won't be coming back'. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't know why people think the subs here are best in the world.  Have they tried subs in new york?   Put simply, these aren't the best subs... NY has better ones.  Having said that, I think it could be the best sub place in downtown Toronto.  Much better than subway by far, and a lot \"lighter\" than the chunky meat subs @ Quiznos  People recommend the Turkey Bacon.  The Turkey tastes just as good if you load up on the sauces.  The beefsteak is very tasty, although the meat is probably garbage.  This one is worth it when you are just hungry and want something bursting of flavour!  The mushrooms as extras are rather good too.  They don't always charge extra for the mushrooms when you ask for them :)  Tip: On a Friday or Saturday night, don't come here at 1.30am - 3.00am.  The line up is huge, and full of noisy drunks...  Go before midnight.  Cash only is silly.  The extra 10% taken by Visa/Mastercard would be made up for by extra sales ... but the place is clearly run by old-school owners.    Not all the staff are friendly, or bright, on your extra requests though.  Be careful :)  I've seen people ordering who get very upset at their requests not being met properly.  Like double microwaved bacon ...  but isn't the customer always right?  The downside is the meats are rather cold when served on the buns, or microwaved only if heated.  Not my preferred style of cooking food for a variety of reasons."}
{"text":"The subs here are classic old school subs. The menu variety is pretty big giving you lots of options to choose from. Although their topping selection isn't as big as Subway, their toppings are always fresh. My favourite is the lettuce they use, it's like angel hair lettuce which gives a totally different texture when eating. The home made sub sauce is very watery and takes some scrubbing to get the smell off your hands. The service is great and the ladies are always friendly.   For lunch time, I recommend getting a 6\" as their 6\" is pretty big compared to Subway or Mr. Sub. I would say their 6\" is more like a 7-8\" sub. Although their meat can be a little tasteless, for a quick cheap lunch (in the area) that can fill you up, it does its job."}
{"text":"Not so hot guys. If you feel you can make a decent sub chances are high you can do better. The sub I had with turkey and bacon was remarkeably bland and I bit into something hard and completely unidentifiable in the midst of my mediocre sandwich. I'd of gone back to complain if I wasn't trapped in meetings all day and or certain I didn't want a free meal out of the place.This is probably my harshest review but it's for good reason.   If I ever go to a Belly Busters again it will be at the original North York location where I'd like to imagine things are done right."}
{"text":"When I first heard that a Belly Busters was opening around the corner from my place / office I was very excited. Every time I am uptown I try to make it a mission to stop in. I was a little worried when I heard they were opening a new location if it would be the same as uptown, but when I got an opportunity to try Belly Busters a day before the grand opening tomorrow I was happy to see many of the same faces from the uptown location.   If you are trying to decide what to order, go for the turkey bacon or bacon combo sub. There is something about microwaved bacon that brings the real magic to these sandwiches.   The prices are a bit more than the downtown location but this is kinda expected for King St. A foot-long Turkey Bacon is about $1 more at $7.65 downtown. This is still very good for this area as it is hard to find cheap lunch options under $10!  Expect this place to be very busy!"}
{"text":"If you like honest to goodness subs, you'll like BellyBuster subs.  I've only tried the turkey bacon sub through Ritual, but the order was fast, service was friendly, and they got everything right. It tastes like a sub from my childhood, which is a good thing. No frills here, just good subs and great toppings."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches for people on the go! They just upgraded their quality of their turkey and crushes subway in terms of quality. Only down side is they don't toast sandwiches but other than that I would recommend you try their sub sauce its amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely a better sub than subway and the other chain sub shops I got the turkey and bacon, and I gotta say the bacon had a great crunch to it. Crispy bacon in a vehicle such as this is what you want for the added texture. You don't want soggy bacon that has been sitting around in a tray for who knows how long. Other pluses is I got mayo and sub sauce, and they didn't overdo it on either. Also, the turkey was pretty thin and the lettuce was ridiculously thin I don't think you could get it any thinner. And I enjoyed it. As far as textures go this is one of the better subs I've had  Really surprised this place only has 3 stars because its a decent filling lunch for under 10 dollars. And with the minimum wage increase I think those places are getting even tougher to find"}
{"text":"i got two free coupons here for sandwiches and tbh it was so average tasting i fell asleep but it was free so i cant complain but i would recommend skipping this one and heading over to subway"}
{"text":"Honestly this place may have the rudest workers in the city. It's almost as if they're trained to be rude because their rude attitude is pretty consistent every time I go in.   BUT, they do make great subs, and the subs are definitely a bang for your buck if you pair it with a drink and bag of chips."}
{"text":"This submarine is beyond horrible. I'm pretty sure submarines can't sink, but this one should.   I work near by so I figured I'd try something new. I walked in and was greeted by a friendly face. There was no one inside during lunch hour, that should have been a hint.    THE SUB IS BLAND! when I mean bland, I mean it didn't even have salt and pepper. I even asked for hot sauce and completely forgot I had asked for some. There's no seasoning what so ever. The whole thing was crazy soggy (see photo) and clearly not work the $8 something paid. I didn't bother finishing my sub.   I won't go back nor would I ever recommend. No offence to the business. The worker was nice though."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a submarine sandwich, Bellybuster would be a great choice! Generous, but not crazy, sized sandwich, bread was fresh, and toppings offered were on point. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This spot is nothing like the original location. At first, the subs were decent and the staff were young and friendly. Fast forward a year or so later and the subs are trash. Previously, at least the bacon was crisp and was on the thicker side. But now the bacon seems to be a lower grade, super thin and soggy. Considering  bacon and turkey bacon subs are their biggest sellers, not sure why they would cheap out and replace the bacon with an inferior product. Don't waste your time going here, this place is no better than Subway or Mr. Sub."}
{"text":"finally. classic smalltown ontario subs downtown. no bullshit or garbage or odd sauces."}
{"text":"Had the super assorted, it is a great sub!!! Fresh veggies!! The meat was sliced thin which i prefer and they were not stingy!! Bun was super fresh as well. Ive been here twice and loved both visits!!!!"}
{"text":"To start with, I'd have to agree with the general sentiment about the food here amongst other reviewers: the subs really are old-school. Allow me to elaborate:  The bread: only two types, white and whole wheat The vegetables: all the usual things (but I liked that they had mushrooms, which Subway doesn't!) The sauces: they had a good variety of sauces, a lot of which you'd find at other sub places as well.   I went with the 12\" Turkey sub, which I thought would be a safe bet given this was the first time I was trying BellyBusters. What disappointed me right off the bat is that the sandwich was cold, and I didn't have an option to have it toasted. I did order off Ritual, so it could be I just didn't have the option when ordering through the app - that was a letdown though.   As far as taste goes, it was definitely fresh, but a bit bland. The non-warmness of it didn't help with the taste either. I couldn't taste the sauces much, and the turkey was also rather flavourless. The size of the sub was good though, and it was definitely filling.   Overall, I'm not sure I'll be coming back here if there's a Subway close-by, but it wasn't a terrible experience. Decent for lunch, but nothing great."}
{"text":"After reading a couple articles I really wanted to try this place, unfortunately I was extremely disappointed and can't figure out what the hype is all about. Maybe because this is their first venture at a second location, but it has been a while since they have opened this downtown location so I assumed they must have worked out their kinks and quality/service issues, but they didn't.  The line wasn't that long, but I found that their staff wasn't that efficient in what they were doing and I don't know why the person at the cash was sitting around talking while the other two staff was frantically keeping up with orders -- their setup wasn't as fast or efficient as Subway or Mr. Subs. For my first Belly Buster experience I decided to order their signature sub by the same name. I was impressed with the amount of toppings you can get with their subs, but everything went down hill from here. I ordered my sub with mayo and everything except for green peppers, however the staff continued to pile on the green peppers as I told her not to put it on as started to dress my sub. I said don't worry about it and leave it on and she gave me a dirty look. She also forgotten to put any mayo on my sub, but that was fine too as with the dressing and gravy they added it made for a very wet and soggy sub.  They asked me if I wanted it heated, but after seeing them nuking other subs in the microwave, I decided to pass. Microwaving bread is a big no-no in my books. The only good thing about Belly Buster was their prices because you are getting a lot of sub for the money, but it was a rather bad sub as it was a wet soggy mess with not much taste. The sauteed mushrooms and gravy was also tasteless and tasted like it came from a can, and their bread was also bland and had no redeeming qualities. I had no appetite to even finish half my sub -- I likened it to a day-old Mr. Sub sandwich.   To top it off the service was extremely bad as the staff looked really sad or pissed off and didn't want to work there.  I would rather spend a little bit more for a sub at Subway, Mr. Subs or Quiznos and get a much tastier sub and friendlier and more courteous service. Belly Buster is a disaster and not worth going to.  I'm wishing Jimmy John's sandwiches from the U.S. would set up shop here. Their subs are so good and would give all the other sub places some serious competition."}
{"text":"Found out about this place through Ritual when I saw they had their promotion for a $5 sub.  Willing to take a chance for a 50% off turkey sub and discover more restaurants downtown, I ordered.  The expectancy given for my sub to be picked up would be 10 minutes but when I got there they told me my sub wasn't ready and it would be another 10 minutes.  I don't fault them on that because it was the lunch rush and it was no big deal.  The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars was because of the service; they're extremely nice there.  The sub also came with a free drink & I got a Vitamin water.    The turkey sub is customizable so I put all of the toppings provided which were mushrooms,  tomatoes, and lettuce with a whole wheat bun.  The bun was dry and tasted like cardboard, the lettuce seemed dry as well and the sandwich didn't have any true flavour that would come in a turkey sub.  Suffice it to say, I was pretty disappointed.  Hopefully, they've improved."}
{"text":"If there's two things I love, that's Turkey subs and promotions for food : ) So I was super stoked when I saw that BellyBuster has a ritual one-time use promotion for a Turkey footlong. I promptly ordered the sub with all my specifications and sent my order.   20 minutes later I enter the store and am surprised to be informed that my sub wasn't made yet. I was disappointed at first, but then the employee explained to me that the order I placed just indicated turkey on a plain white bun. The employee thought this was suspicious and waited instead for me to arrive so that I could validate that this was in fact not my order... and boy was I really happy about that. (Like what kind of sub was just bread and meat)  So I started listing out my toppings. Mushrooms, lettuce, tomato when I realize halfway that the employee was using white bread when I had indicated whole wheat on my ritual app. I asked if it was still possible to switch to a whole wheat bun, and to my surprise, they were totally cool with it!  The second time I used ritual to order a turkey sub, I asked for more turkey instead of bacon (since the original sub was a turkey club)... and happily enough... I got a really generous dose of turkey :)  All I can say is that the employees at this sandwich joint are super friendly and compliant to my picky needs. The service here is absolutely remarkable.  The sub itself was also pretty tasty. I found that the bun was a little richer than the typical bread you get at Subway. The foot longs are also ACTUALLY footlong, and they are pretty generous with the meat. The two cons I have with the subs here are 1) they aren't toasted/grilled so the sub was really cold 2) the vegetables are kind of wet, so if you don't eat your sub quickly enough... it gets pretty soggy and gross  Overall, very pleased with my experience at Bellybuster Subs :)"}
{"text":"Am I the only person who took their first bite and though, \"This tastes like Mr Sub\"? Maybe it's the shoestring lettuce, but that's all I could think while tucking into a turkey bacon. It's not bad! By any means. I was just a little disappointed because everyone and their grandma was so excited for this Midtown institution to make its way downtown.    There was a line out the door at 2pm when I went so at least it'll be around long enough for me to give it a second stab."}
{"text":"If you can put up with the bitchy staff who hate their lives, they make good subs. Better than the big 2, but not worth $13 a sub imho. Probably won't be back simply because of the miserable attitude of the staff."}
