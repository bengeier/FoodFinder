{"text":"We had Phil the Grill cater our event and it was the bomb!  Everyone is still commenting about how delicious the food was! The brisket was my favorite but his ribs are also yummy too! Everything was perfect - ribs, brisket,  wings, beans, Cole slaw. Phil shows up early and sets up everthing for your event.  His personality just adds to the experience  - Phil is the best! I even recommended him to a friend who also recently hired Phil the Grill and they were also very pleased! I highly recommend Phil the Grill!"}
{"text":"Visited this truck at Foodie Fest in Las Vegas.  The viewing samples were packed with meat so we decided to try them, I had the Philly & my girlfriend got the Boss Hog. They were both 85% bun, 10% sauce,  4% onion and 1% meat. Very disappointed for $15 a piece!!.. Couldn't"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely one of the best BBQ that I have ever had. Super tasty and reasonable prices too. Even something as simple as baked beans were soooo good!"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ Mac Rolls and the Orange IPA Wings, Delicious! So happy I came across this truck. My new favorite place and you can pre-order to save some time."}
{"text":"I was initially intrigued by this food truck leaving a local brewery because my name is  Phil as well and I vaguely remember the chef being temperamentally challenged by annoying critics on the cooking show chopped on the food network.   I digress, but the food/quality was food network worthy and because Phil had been on chopped I felt assured that I would probably not regret ordering outside my normal comfort zone, while at a BBQ truck. After a brief conversation with Phil I tried the mango pork chops and they were absolutely phenomenal.   If you happen to see this truck out definitely worth the line/wait. Overall awesomeness and will actively seek this truck out the next time I find myself at any local beer garden or brewery"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time today I got the lemon pepper wings and the Philly hoagie with waffle Fries. Freakin delicious! I will most definitely be making this a regular spot!!!
