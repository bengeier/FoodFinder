{"text":"When I first arrived to Cleveland this was the first place I went to for a drink and I have to say this is an excellent place to enjoy great wine good drinks with an excellent setting. The bar tenders are excellent they know their wine and are quality. The bar setting is just right nicely dimmed lights, quality setting music, sensual feel to the place. If you are looking for big screens and lots of noise and loud loud music this isn't the place. If you are looking for a sensual, romantic, and relaxing friendly venue this is the place. The wine list is quality, the drinks are as well, but the icing on the cake is the service. I hope they are paying the bartenders well because they deserve it."}
{"text":"Great news for all wine-lovers:  Market Avenue Wine Bar has re-opened in a lovely new spot right across the street from its former location.  It is now located next door to The Flying Fig.  The new place has the same cozy atmosphere and excellent wine selection - and, the food is perfectly chosen to compliment the main attraction.  The various small plates are ample enough to create an entire meal.  This is the absolute perfect place to bring a date or meet with a friend - hours will pass and before you realize it you will have consumed the best wine you've had in a long time!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been sitting at a table for 20 minutes waiting for a server to ask us for our order. Went inside and the douchy guy behind the bar said to go outside and someone would be with us. Very down on this place. No customer service."}
{"text":"I had a great experience during my maiden trip to Market Avenue Wine Bar. I had a steamy hot mug of the mulled wine which I am pleased to share was not sweet but cinnamony and warming. My table also shared a cheese and fruit plate served with a piping hot baguette--truly the perfect accompaniment to a glass of wine. The service was excellent and the bartender was very knowledgable.This is definitely a great place to come hang out and enjoy with friends. I can't think of a better pre-dinner drink spot or destination for a girl's night. Market Ave Wine Bar is definitely a gem in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Great ambience. If I come back to Cleveland, will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Market Avenue Wine Bar is a great spot to grab a drink or glass of wine. it's a cozy, intimate space. It has a large wine selection. I've never seen the place super crowded either, which is always a plus.   The one bartender, Max, is very cute and sweet."}
{"text":"Favorite wine bar in Cleveland. Atmosphere is perfect and selection is good. It's particularly nice in the winter."}
{"text":"This place is a really fun place to go. I used to frequent this place when I lived in the neighborhood. I'm pleased with the wine selection, I'm always happy with small plates, because that is the way I prefer to eat. I like to snack on many flavors for all my meals. I love that when a bunch of 20 somethings hang out and not everyone is ordering they're ok with it. I love the dark cozy decor, and the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The Market Ave. Wine bar is VERY laid-back and well-stocked with fine wines and an ever-changing beer menu. The servers are always very friendly (although not always fast!). I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"I love a great wine happy hour....while walking from the West Side Market I came along this place because I was looking for somewhere to chill and relax...walked in and immediately the guy said hello and welcomed me in...\"we have happy hour going on with a great selection of wines\"...my kinda place. Great lounge music too! I'm liking Cleveland thus far on my 1 at visit here!"}
{"text":"I love this place - my favorite spot on Ohio City .... Great wine (or beer or cocktails) ... Amazing service ... Love the small plates!!!  In nice weather the patio is fabulous but inside is wonderful at any time!"}
{"text":"Nicely tucked away spot to enjoy wine....the  waiter/waitress was great in recommending wine...I tried the Meritage and Pegasus both red and LOVE THEM....cheese/cracker plates pair great with the wines.....nice to check out"}
{"text":"This place had a great selection of wine and a good atmosphere. On a Friday or Saturday night it can be pretty crowded and noisy, but overall it makes for a great place to go grab a glass a wine and relax with family and friends. I was also pleasantly surprised with their beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a great wine bar in a lovely location.  I grew up on the east side and frequented the wine bar on Coventry, which I still love, but when I moved to the west side I didn't know if there was going to be a chill spot to share a bottle of wine with friends.  This place has been a great spot to go get a drink with friends or get retail carry-out from.  Joy always has great recommendations and understands when you're on a budget!  They also have a selection of good beers, have wine tasting parties, and offer a delightful selection of light apps."}
{"text":"The wine bar is always busy when we get to that side of town and the service never lacks. you can pick up tidbits about wine while you survey an alleyway style street on the patio (weather permitting). I always take out of towners to the west side market and then to Market Ave Wine Bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  The sommelier made great recommendations and was friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended, not to mention it is right across the street from Great Lakes Brewery."}
{"text":"The market bar is absolutely fabulous. The atmosphere is very quaint and cozy, with plenty of candle light ambiance. The menu is surprisingly robust, with plenty of offerings for anyone's taste.   The staff was great, offering plenty of help with selections without at all being overbearing. This would be an excellent spot for a date, or quiet catch up with close friends."}
{"text":"market avenue wine bar is movin' on up to the east side.  literally.  it's now on the east side of the street.    so there's the new location across the street where talkies used to be.  and i'm glad this great place didn't disappear, and only moved.  let me say that first and foremost.  also, the space is not *that* much different from across the way.  it still has the great lighting and lots of wood (actually, it's so new you can still smell the varnish on the bar), and it's much more spacious than the old location.  same great menu, same great wine list, same helpful staff (yes, the best woman in cleveland to recommend a bottle of wine, joy, is still there dispensing her grape infested knowledge).    but i have to say:  i miss that great space that was the upstairs of the old location.  it was just so cozy and neat.  don't get me wrong- i still love the market avenue wine bar and am glad they now have more space to accommodate those busy weekend evenings full of parties and couples.    but there is something to be said in progress.  sometimes a bit of the nuance is lost.  it's really not that much different than the old place.  i'm just uber sensitive.  and i really did love the old space, even if it was smaller.  but i'll get used to having more room to relax with friends and a bottle of wine.  that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Market ave wine bar is the bomb! Great hors d'oerves..fab wine, has great places to meet networking groups like the Gorilla Group that I ran into on my last visit. A great group for locales that are entrepreneurs...the guy who ran the meeting was inspiring..Larson? Great pours!"}
{"text":"Greatness. The beer and wine list are simply wonderful and the light eats are perfect. Joy! (both the emotion and the person) Best wine bar in the city!"}
{"text":"Cool, unassuming little wine bar.  Great place to have a glass of vino before heading to the Fig for dinner (or for any other reason, actually).  Lots of charm.  And check out that awesome back room that's calling your name to rent it out for a private party.  But I call dibs on that 8-point buck mounted above the fireplace..."}
{"text":"Living in the area, I'm surprised I've never came here before. It's the cutest place to get a glass of wine on the weekend! The atmosphere and the fancy chandeliers makes for the perfect date night or just a place to hang out with friends. Got to meet the owner and he was very kind and made sure we were always taken care of. I can't seem to remember which red wine I got but I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Cozy space for wine and great conversation! Quite a drink variety on their menu so you don't need to get wine if you prefer otherwise. Food was also good - most small plates come with a loaf of bread..I wish there were more gluten free / veggie options but it was delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Every time I have gone it has been for a work event. They offer great prices for groups and have a nice size party room in the back. For $20 each (about 30 people) we received 6 wine tasting and heavy apps. The wine connoisseur takes you through the country of wines you are tasting. This place would also be excellent for a girls night!!! Food is good wine is great!!"}
{"text":"Awesome wine selection! Stumbled on this place by accident, but so glad I popped in. Cozy, across the street from Great Lakes, and the staff is beyond nice. It was also pretty quiet so we had a chance to enjoy a whole bottle while killing time and no one rushed us out. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere + great wine! Especially awesome in the summer when you can take advantage of their outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening and had a wonderful time. They have a fantastic wine selection with a variety of price points so there's something for everyone. I will say there isn't really anything below $8 a glass so just keep that in mind with your group. They also had a decent beer selection for non-wine drinkers. The atmosphere was dim and romantic but comfortable and we didn't get a snooty vibe. We were definitely underdressed as we were in the middle of moving but still treated respectfully. Our server was incredibly friendly! I'm sad we didn't get his name but the service was definitely a bonus. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wished they would have had a few more dessert options and it wasn't a great destination for larger groups. However, we had a fantastic cozy evening and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, beatnik decor and an eclectic beverage collection.  What more can one ask for?  :)  Lower prices?    Well, these prices are market average, and they also had a selection of 4 meads.  Mead!  I love it.  It's too rare to find mead these days.  The Dansk Viking's Blod was pretty good, actually.  I had a bottle of Kurofune (Black ships) and a Hitachino Ginger beer.  Great stuff.  The service was fine and brisk, though one must include the fact that there were patrons at the moment.  The decor is long on wood, painted dark.  The texture is older, aged, but hardly unappealing.  If it weren't for the mead, and the beer selection, I'd give this place a 3... but I need my fix of odd beverages!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight (Monday) at 9pm with some friends. I'm not super knowledgable about wine, but I definitely enjoyed the great ambiance and service! Lots of curtains, dimmed lighting, and dark wood furniture. We ordered a bottle of wine to share based on the recommendation of our server. Good times ensued.   On the same block is the Flying Fig bistro and a cozy coffee shop (Koffie Cafe.)   Great neighborhood wine bar!"}
{"text":"I suppose we all have our \"off days.\"  God knows, I've had a few of them myself!  :-)  It is in that spirit that I'm going to cut the Market Avenue Wine Bar some slack.  A few weeks back, I had a pretty crummy experience there.  The wine bar has always been one of my Cleveland faves, and the bad experience surprised me.    However, just today, the owner wrote me a personal email to apologize for the rude service during my past visit.  He promised they'd do better the next time out.  Based on all of the wonderful times I've had there in the past, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  So for now, I'm moving my star rating for the Market Avenue Wine Bar back up to 4 out of 5.  Here's hoping they were just having an \"off night\" and are still just as awesome as they've always been.  ...we will see.  :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here recently for some light food and wine after a tough moving day. Everything (both food and wine) was really excellent. We are big winos so it's great to see a place with such an extensive menu. The server was also very friendly and as a plus a few people had dogs on the patio. It doesn't seem many places in Cleveland are dog friendly so it's nice to know we have a place to bring out pup when we want to go out with him."}
{"text":"This place was perfect. Tucked away on a little side street across from the West Side Market, MAWB was exactly what we were looking for last night. Quiet enough that we could talk, but lively enough to be interesting, and the atmosphere was perfect--slightly darkened and nicely decorated with bottles of wine everywhere and giant chandeliers. The wine selection was amazing--I am a huge fan of moscato di asti and they had two to choose from, and the one I selected was great! We also got the baked brie with a baguette and fruit--very nice selection of fruit on the tray. I wished I lived closer--this would be my go-to place for a romantic eventing after dinner or a night out with the girls!!"}
{"text":"Relaxing, quaint and cute with a fabulous selection. The outdoor seating is perfect for nice weather and has a really nice, laid back feel. I love having a glass of wine or two here-- perfect for catching up with a friend or bringing someone from out of town who isn't trying to drink the night away at a crowded bar. Great environment to have a drink plus a good conversation, which someone isn't easy to find at night. The inside is adorable as well with a very cozy feel. I will for sure be going to here when I feel like having a drink to ease my Cleveland winter blues."}
{"text":"This is a very good wine bar. Very knowledgable staff (esp. Joy), enormous selection, laid back atmosphere, what more could you want? The snacks are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Unpretentious and wine seem like an oxymoron waiting to happen...for some. This wine bar approaches the topic with respect and low prices. You will NOT find some of these wines at these prices. '02 Peter Michael 'les pavots' for $210? '97 Joseph Phelps Insignia for sub $200? These are collectibles at any price and you may be able to find a good deal online; however, purchasing and enjoying them at a restaurant/wine bar would normally set you back twice as much. The list is fairly priced and offers great variety. Last night I tasted the 'Symphorine', an '02  grand cru grower champagne. Toasty yeast and bright Bartlett pear laced in a perfect steam of tiny bubbles: $91 on the list. A bargain. These are some of the pricier wines they offer, to be sure, but their by the glass list ranges from $6 to $18...and they have 20-30. If you love wine, then you owe it to yourself to stop by this neighborhood wine dispensary...or whatever."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say about the Wine Bar. Its quiet, romantic, and full of the best wine you can get in Cleveland. The staff can recommend a good wine depending on your mood and taste (esp Nick). Their light appetizers and desserts are absolutely scrumptious.   I recommend: Any wine on the list Baked Brie Tampenade Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake  Avoid: Large groups   Overall: Raise your glasses and toast to Market Avenue Wine Bar"}
{"text":"Wine was awesome. The bartender chick was the bare minimum of pleasant. I mean minimum. It's a shame, because if she had been interested in us being there when the rest of Ohio City has their heads up the Indian''s asses we would have stayed."}
{"text":"I want to write the lengthy, beautiful review that this place deserves but truth be told, it thrives on the simplicity of what it is. An elegant wine bar that transports you to wherever you want to be at that moment. The staff is well versed and everything about this place can trick you into wanting to spend forever here. If you truly enjoy wine and want a memorable evening then I can not recommend this wine bar enough. You'll be so happy you came!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots. We love to visit on Sunday when it's not crowded.  Not very impressed with new wine list revamp...now it's restaurant prices in giant eagle bottles.  Secondly my first two choices couldn't be found....ok on to the third choice.  Our server was a little too personal.....he might as well sat at our table....he never left. Clingy!!!  Where did Nick & Max go??? We miss them!!!"}
{"text":"Service and overall wine knowledge shine here.   I can't remember who the server was the day we came in, but he was spot on. He picked one white that I wasn't fond us, but helped us try numerous other reds that were out of this world. And don't you dare forget to try their mulled red. On a chilly day, this steamy, spicy treat will not weigh you down with sweetness, but will warm you from the inside out. I was so relieved to taste it and find a dryness about it--thank god.   We also ordered a cheese plate and again this thing came out with a glorious hunk of freshly baked baguette and lots of fruit. Oh yes. The perfect combo to soak up lots of wine drinking...   With the helpful, knowledgeable staff, great wine selection, perfect ambiance and delectable menu of nibbles, this place is a winner all around."}
{"text":"I was just reminiscing about the past three times I've been here and figured it was time to write this review.  When I first came, it was decorated for Halloween, which was adorably whimsical. The space is small and intimate. Perhaps because it's right next door to a coffee shop, it shares in those characteristics: very relaxed and welcoming. You can stay as long as you please with minimal interruptions. The dim lights and dark wood definitely create an ambiance that makes lovers want to snuggle up next to each other and share a bottle of wine.   ...A bottle of wine which is either on special or chosen from their great selection. The last time I went, I fell in love with a great Carmenere. The boyfriend got a Bordeaux. And they know their wine - please ask them questions and tell them what you want from your glass. They'll partner you up with something you're bound to enjoy.   During the winter months they serve hot cider. Which made my experience seasonally charming!   They have a few munchies and desserts on the menu. And they don't just serve wine - they have a fully stocked bar - so, if you're a Manhattan girl... ;-)  I love it when I can write a review about a great people watching moment... consider this one of those reviews. Woman cries and cusses out her lover since she's had one too many drinks and realizes he won't leave his wife for her. She runs out without her jacket and he goes after her...   It was priceless. Hope it worked out for them; I really do."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a little over a year and just love it.  There's a great book club that meets here and the wine selection is excellent.  The people are knowledgeable and it's a great place to start if you're new to wine.  And they have awesome bruschetta :)"}
{"text":"Cute cozy place.  I stopped in based on the great yelp reviews - so a big thank you to the Cleveland Yelpers for such great guidance!    I loved the decor and the calm, New England-y vibe inside.  People reading books with glasses of wine - totally cool and unintimidating.    The bartender was sweet and had some great wine suggestions, all very reasonably priced and delicious.  I also ordered the cheese & fruit plate, which came with bread, and I think I received enough food to feed all of Cleveland.  It was delicious!  Great place to come alone, on a date, or in a small group.  Save your sloppy drunken nights for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am still looking for a Wine Bar like the Market Ave Wine Bar in Pittsburgh.  I miss places like this from my years in Cleveland (most of my fond memories in Cleveland are food and drink based).   They have such an awesome selection of wines, decent prices for many of the higher end wines (Silver Oak was not marked up as much as I have seen it marked up elsewhere) and a nice diverse selection in terms of costs.  They always have good Oregon wines too... not many places have the Willamette Valley wines and they tend to be some of my favorites.   The food is always good too!  It is a great spot for a date, pre dinner drink, post dinner drink, catching up with a girlfriend or even a quick business meeting.  I will keep coming back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the boyfriend for few glasses of wine before heading out to dinner. Best part about this place is definitely the ambiance. Beautiful interior, dim lights, soft music and delicious wine. Our server recommended a glass of shiraz that was quite possibly one of the most amazing red wines I've ever tasted. Huge selection of wines to choose from at very affordable prices. Highly recommend this wine bar for a date or wine night."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the girls after a long week and was extremely pleased with the service. Rob is AWESOME. Their extended services and venue rental make this the perfect spot to plan your next event."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday evening.  Madeline was alone serving all outdoor and indoor patrons.  She was amazing.  I had smoked rainbow trout plate.  Superb.  Her recommendation of a French chardonnay, equally superb.  She stopped by my table regularly, made me laugh, and shared great info on things to do and places to go in Cleveland.  Thanks, Madeline."}
{"text":"It's funny how I stumbled across Market Avenue Wine Bar. I actually went to Corks Wine Bar up on Erie Street of Willoughby, OH to get drinks with friends and to watch March Madness game on tv. While sitting at the bar, I started chatting with the owner and he told me he had had a store in Ohio City called Market Avenue Wine Bar. He gave me his business card and signed his name telling me to present this at Market Avenue and get a free drink on him.  With that being said... about 3 months later, my friends and I threw a surprise birthday party for our friends at Market Avenue Wine Bar. Here are my quick observations: 1. the decor of the wine bar is cozy, antique, unique, beautiful,  2. plenty of drink selections.. more than enough 3. awesome staff, quick service, friendly staff 4. quiet place to grab drinks  The decorations in this place are so worth seeing. The couches are all unique in its own way and the place is set up perfectly for a big party or just a couple sitting down for a nice comfortable drink.   And I must say, it has a very similar layout as the Corks Wine Bar too!"}
{"text":"Really like. This place. Huge selection of wines! Also had beer and spirits, you can get small played of food. Atmosphere is tremendous!"}
{"text":"What a great place to share an evening. The decor is perfect, it feels classy and relaxed. Every table has a real candle.   If you like pinot noir the highway 101 was really tasty. It was soft, not sweet but was not over the top with tannins.  Very smooth with hints of rose. It pared well with the cheese and meat board. One cheese that stood out was the Red dragon cheddar,one of my favs, it has stone ground mustard."}
{"text":"Love this wine bar. Great wine selections with a lot of reasonably priced bottles. They allow dogs inside, which is lovely too. The service here has always been great as well, and the ambiance is wonderful."}
{"text":"Possibly best wine bar in Cleveland. Wine selection is fantastic,  food is tapas style and tastes amazing. Definitely a hidden gem in Ohio City. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Romance and relaxation abound here. And a little wine and some good light bites.  It's perfect for dates (yes, I'm speaking from experience), a girl's night out, and even a little work. I'm happy to report the food is really tasty, too!  The prices per glass are very reasonable and it's easy to just get lost in the dark, comfort Market Avenue offers.  You can tell the place switches from relaxing to romantic once the sun goes down so keep that in mind when you go.  One bizarre aspect you might encounter here - as I did on my most recent visit - was the soundtrack. I appreciated the tunes from all over the world - but scratched my head when a tune about horses started playing - (the tune only had one lyric - I bet you can't guess which lyric that was). To each his own I suppose, but that tune became the true entertainment of the entire evening."}
{"text":"Great space and always warm & welcoming.  Katie & Nicholas are solid and on it.  Beer drinker and they nail it.   Wine drinkers will be in heaven! Good times & worth the stop in."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place, so I was really sad how my friends were treated when we were in a few months ago. We had a table of 8 girls, and we ordered bottles of wine.  Eventually, we asked if we could see a food menu, and the bartender was very rude and said \"I can't make food right now, I'm the only one here\" and stormed away. Why there would only be one worker on a Saturday is confusing to begin with, but a simple \"I'm sorry\" would've gone a long way. We left and I probably won't return, there are too many other places I'd rather spend my money."}
{"text":"Had a light dinner here, was very pleasant, quite casual, but nice and at the time (early evening) not so busy - so nice sip some wine, have some soup, read a book place"}
{"text":"Oh Market Avenue Wine bar, you are well played on so many levels.  This small and lovely wine bar flies under the radar when stacked against some of the major players in the area. If crowds, overly drunk people and DJs aren't your thing, then cozy up in the warm and inviting Wine Bar. It's like a shining light glows around this place that welcomes all of us that hate crowds.  The food selection isn't super robust, but the charcuterie is awesome. Also, let's be real, this is the mecca for wine-os. Their wine selection is fantastic and the staff are super helpful to give suggestions. They also have a collection of major vintages, totaling over 300. You can really get lost trying all the different wines! It's the perfect place to catch up with a friend or have a date night.  The ambience inside the Wine Bar is very comfortable and effortlessly exudes classiness. There's also a small outdoor patio that offers limited seating. If you're lucky enough to grab a seat, aim to sit and watch the sunset over the West Side Market. It will sweeten your night!"}
{"text":"This place is fan-freaking-tastic. Amazing atmosphere, wonderful wine and beer selection, and awesome staff.  I've been to this place 3 times, each time with a different group of friends. Each time I sat down, the bartender Joy (it seems so offensive to call her a bartender....this woman is a beer and wine CONNOISSEUR and she is utterly brilliant) has greeted us in her funny sarcastic way and has provided us with wonderful recommendations. She also remembered my name the second and third time I was there.....I was totally impressed.  If you haven't gone, GO. If you don't know much about wine, ask Joy...she'll get you on track. Just GO. Now."}
{"text":"We found ourselves here on a \"Wine Wednesday\" night. We walked into the bar with NO ONE in sight. We walked outside, around, and even took a walk to the neighboring restaurant/cafe where they said the bartender had gone out and was going to be back momentarily. Hmmm?  When she finally came back from upstairs (?), she got us a cute seat outside and took our order. We both got a glass of rose and a hummus plate. Both were great!  Besides the mishap at the beginning of our visit, the ambiance of the little patio seating was lovely. We will be going back, but hopefully the bartender will be there when we arrive next time."}
{"text":"Great Lakes was closed Sunday which was disappointing, but we decided to have a drink here on the patio. GREAT wine selection and the street is pretty quiet so it was a perfect little happy hour. The inside is beautifully decorated, but it was too nice of a day not to be outside. The had a pretty nice tapas menu as well, but $4 is a little steep for the tiny ramekin (sp?) of mixed nuts we ordered. Definitely would be back though - us Pittsburghers' always enjoy Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Not a local myself, I saw this walking by and thought it would be a great place to just stop in--and it was! The bartender (who was also the waitress) came over and gave us some great recommendations on what to try, and we ended up trying 2 of their ports, a moscato, and a Belgian Raspberry beer. Not a beer fan myself, I have to say the entire selection was excellent.  We also got the bread platter with the Olive Tapenade and (I believe it was a) Marinara sampler, which was an excellent snack as we talked and enjoyed the wonderful fall weather just inside the establishment. We were there in the late afternoon and it was empty, so I suspect this place gets a bit busier toward the evening.    Defintely a place to try if you are in town!"}
{"text":"I visited the Market Avenue Wine Bar a little while ago for a social outing for a sorority alumni group.  The place is small, charming and rustic - I absolutely loved it.  The waitress was friendly and understanding that I know very little about wines, and recommended something that I was very happy with.  I think this would be a great place for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have a glass of wine. Had the Chateau des Leotins Bordeaux, which was very enjoyable.  The server was very helpful and suggested wines that fit your personal preference very well."}
{"text":"Great spot in ohio city for a quiet drink and a chill bar.  We stopped here for appetizers and cocktails before a larger meal with a small group, and my party was impressed by the selection and the prices of the wine, beer, and specialty drinks here. We sampled a half dozen wines (which were all professionally recommended and hit the mark perfectly) and enjoyed some rare mead that was a great treat.  Spiced mulled wine later was also new and interesting, and I very much enjoyed every bit of it on a snowy Cleveland evening."}
{"text":"It's a wondrous alternative to the surrounding breweries. The wine selection... Lol.... I'm being forced to add more characters."}
{"text":"I came into this place because when I walked by the front it looked so cozy for a cold winter night. I was meeting a few friends out, but I was already in the area so I went in alone first. I ordered a split of prosecco at the bar and the bartender was very nice. My friends then arrived so we moved to a table. We each had one drink. There was a different guy waiting on the tables. When we finished our drinks we asked for separate bills. I know how annoying this is/can be. However, we each only had one drink, and also apologized after we had asked for separate checks. When we asked for the separate bills the waiter sarcastically goes \"I love doing separate checks\" and then walks away. I'm thinking....okay that was rude? He then comes and drops the bills off at our table and as he sets them down he goes \"here you guys can figure it out.\" Also very rude. I'm thinking, I'm not sure why you couldn't have just said \"here you go whenever you're ready.\" We are capable adults able to figure out which bill belongs to each of us. So, we did. We paid and left. It would have been a better experience had the server not been so rude and sarcastic. I might come back and sit at the bar but will probably never go back with a group. In my humble opinion (as someone who also works in the service industry) part of doing so is learning when to fake being nice even when you don't want to be. His sarcasm was very off-putting and rude."}
{"text":"Love it One of my favorite places to hang out. I usually end every night there."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place was the atmosphere/decor.  The place as a whole was laid back but in a classy way.  Darkly lit, exposed bricks, and a short concise menu.  I wouldn't really call it small plates - but more appetizers and salads.    The wine selection was wonderful and they had a pretty good beer selection as well.   My friend and I split three dishes, a charcuterie type meat/cheese plate, brushcetta and a smoke fish.  All three were delicious and fresh.  The portions were much larger than expected (we were expecting small plate sized portions).  Two dishes would've been better for two of us but its okay because I walked out with a whole carry-out container of left-overs.  But all in all I would recommend any of those dishes to someone.  The service was spectacular, and in a very real way, there was nothing fake or forced.  And I really enjoyed the music being played as well :)"}
{"text":"This venue should not be missed.  I have been going here since the venue was across the street (where the great lakes gift shop is).  Although the venue moved across the street, there are a few familiar faces like Joy and Eric.   The service is impeccable.  I went there with  good friend on a recent visit back home. He likes sweeter wines and I do not.  I was in the mood for a fume blank, but they did not have one available by the glass.  However, I told Joy what I wanted and she brought over a pinot blank to try.  It was OK, but she knew that was not what I wanted.  She brought over another one and it was just what I was looking for.  After my glass of white, I had a glass of Malbec.  The one Eric poured me was not on the menu.  It was fantastic.  So, remember they may have other selections available.  Make sure you ask them questions and they will do their very best to make your experience memorable.   In addition to the beverages we ordered a baked brie.  The brie came on  cutting board with an array of beautifully sliced fruits and two small loaves of warm bread.  The bread was more than enough and the portion was perfect for the two of us.   Please note in addition to the extensive wine selection, they even have a great selection of speciality beers too!   Be sure to visit this venue soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best wine bar in Northeast Ohio.  After a delicious gourmet meal at The Flying Fig, my fiancèe and I wanted to keep our date night going with some sophisticated swil. Luckily, right next door is Market Avenue Wine bar.  Wine bars are kind of my thing and my favorites have always been on the West Coast or NYC, but now this classy joint it is def one of favorites.      The atmosphere can be described as romantic elegance meets Art Museum - the colors inside are dark reds and wood, beautiful gothic chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and gorgeous paintings (some of which you can find at the CLE Museum of Art) adorn the walls.  All of this in summation equals the perfect atmosphere with which to enjoy delicious wine paired with good conversation with friends or a significant other.   As another awesome bonus, they have a huge room in the back that can be booked for private events, complete with a fireplace, couches, more art, open windows, and another bar- that just happened to be free and open the night we were there, adding some nice room to walk around with.       Besides the amazing ambiance/building, the overall experience was accentuated by the delicious wine and service.  Our bartender, Max (I think) was awesome.  He was very friendly, nice, and informative - giving me a great suggestion for sake (delicious) as well as imparted upon me some interesting wine knowledge and recommended one of the most flavorful Pinot Noire's I've enjoyed.  Also, everyone here seemed to be well-dressed, 20 and 30 something professionals, which is our crowd as well.      Market Avenue Wine Bar, again, is hands down the best wine bar in the area, or anywhere for that matter and is the perfect place to gather with friends for a classy night out."}
{"text":"Love this quaint little gem in Cleveland! With it's outside patio (they let you bring leashed dogs!), vintage photographs, and cozy intimate indoor decor you just can't go wrong. There cheese platter with warm/fresh bread is not a bad bang for your buck. But if you buy a glass of wine, I'd say their prices are average compared to other wineries.  Our waiter was extremely nice & helpful in finding a bottle of wine that all of us could enjoy. And a fun fact is, if you get too drunk at the wine bar you can always walk next door to the connected coffee house ;)"}
{"text":"This place is super cute. Dim lighting, wine and chandeliers I'm in. There are some appetizer, finger food options I did not try the food but would like to go back for their bruchetta. They had three different kinds and I can't get it out of my head.  There is bar seating and some tables. There also was a event going on on the other side of the place.   Word of advice if you are going to have more then one glass of a certain wine just buy the bottle. The pours were good but by the time we bought four glasses we could of just bought a whole bottle and got more for what we paid. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"If you haven't found the ultra chill Market Avenue area of Ohio City, please stop reading and move on to another review.....I want this area to myself.  For those of you \"in the know\", make sure you stop into MAWB for a great experience.  Over 3 visits, both summer and winter, this wine bar has become one of my favorite hangouts.  The service is impeccable, the atmosphere perfect.  Whether on the patio under the white Christmas lights on a warm summer evening or inside in the classy interior, this is the place you want to come for a relaxing night of conversation and wine with friends.    MAWB specializes in small plate foods, perfect for snacking and keeping the buzz in the perfect warm balance.  The meat and cheese tray, built to your liking with the likes of capicola, salami, gouda, brie, pears, strawberries.....is a steal, and enough for 4 people to share.  The grape leaves are superb.    As for wine, well....this is a wine bar.  The servers are well-versed in the wine list, and are excellent at recommending wines based on your reported tastes.  Not usually a fan of Napa wines, the Girl has fallen for one of our friend Ramone's favorites, \"The Prisoner\".  Whether buying by the glass or bottle, you will be satisfied with your selection.  As for service, what more can I say?  The staff are attentive but almost invisible, almost knowing your next request before you think of it.  Our service outside was as good as our indoor service, and I honestly feel that 25% is too little to tip based on the service we have received.  Kudos for hiring such a great staff!  So, if you already know about Market Avenue, drop in, have a bottle, and enjoy a true gem in a great neighborhood.  If you don't, continue on over to E.4th street, a busier version of this area, so I can have Market Avenue to myself!"}
{"text":"So, I may not be a wine expert, but this place is fantastic for me.    Cute space. Great wine list. Dark wood.  All I need is some Toni Braxton and it would be the perfect romantic evening.... No?   This is definitely the best wine list I've seen  so far in the CLE.  And while I may be just be getting into wine (so therefore may be untrustworthy!) I did see quite a few bottles on their list considered harder to find.  Lots of great bottles in the lower and mid price ranges, which is nice.  So many places jump from $30 to $300.  The place is small, though, so come early, or have a plan B!"}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet cold Sunday evening - it's such a cute little wine bar, lots of options and really good mulled wine. Nice place for a conversation with friends and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Three Cheers for the Market Ave. Wine Bar.  This place is great in any season, but what I love about it is the patio drinking.  There is no better place to watch people in Ohio City. You have the (sometimes) train wreck that is the Great Lakes Brew Pub next door with a truly great wine and beer list at your fingertips (including the aforementioned GL products).   The staff knows their way around the wine list and can usually pull something wonderful out of their \"by the glass\" list for you to try."}
{"text":"fantastic little wine bar across the street from the Westside Market. Joy, the bartender/sommelier  did a great job steering us in the right direction with her choices of wine for us. Nice cheese plate as well. very dark as relaxing. a very pleasant evening. We will be back any time we are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very cute, and small wine bar in Cleveland. It's got a nice patio and a very comfortable inside area. A lot of people that like a quieter and more relaxed atmosphere will tell you this is their favorite place to go and it's a wine bar which is a plus! They have soo many bottles of wine and I especially like the choices for the Red Wines."}
{"text":"I've been working my way down this street. I've been to Market at the Fig and Flying Fig and finally got around to trying this place, Market Avenue Wine Bar. Next up - the coffee shop.   The patio, even though in front of the restaurant on the sidewalk, is quite quiet and comfortable as this restaurant is on a one way street with only a few other restaurants. Adjacent to the Flying Fig's patio, this one has some park bench seating with pillow cushions.     Market Ave doesn't have a large entree section on their menu, but they have a decent selection of really good tapas and surprising to me a large pizza menu. The pizzas are very Italian in my mind based on the topping options. I got mine with Basel ($.50), olives ($.5) and salami ($1)! Such great flavor! The pizzas are quite carb heavy though as they're served on French bread. But it's so good and flakey. The presentation is neat too - served on a thick slab paddle shaped wooden cutting board.   The appetizer/tapas that's my favorite was the small red stuffed peppers. Served cold. Amazing flavor! I would say the serving is only enough for one though.   The service is friendly and contributes to the at home atmosphere.   I highly recommend visiting this place when you need somewhere relaxing to eat, drink and unwind. Dogs welcome on the patio."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.  The wine list is great and the staff is very helpful and will steer you in the right directions, which is nice if you are just learning about wine.  The outdoor patio is great the only downside is that the inside is somewhat small. Other than that it's spectacular!"}
{"text":"Service has gone down recently. I've been coming to this wine bar since before they moved to the opposite side of the street, several years ago. I even hosted a wonderful wedding shower here two years ago. I've always had great service and great wine. Yesterday, I went in to meet a friend and asked to taste the seasonal mulled wine. It was a bit too heavy on the clove for my liking, so I asked to taste one of the wines by the glass prior to ordering. Instead of giving me the sample, the bartender described the wine in pretentious wine speak, and looked at me. I said, that's fine, may I please taste it. She said, \"well we really don't like to give out more than one sample, that's why we describe it\". I blinked...She then begrudgingly poured the sample, which I did enjoy, and subsequently ordered. My friend and I were both turned off, so we finished up our glasses and went next door (where we were offered unprompted samples of wine to find a good fit). Prior to leaving Market Wine, however, I mentioned to the bartender that I'd been coming in for years, and had never had a bartender balk at giving a sample of wine. She said this is a recent directive from the owner. Since this is the second time in the last month I've had less than stellar service here, I'm afraid the service may have just gone down. Maybe they'll get some new staff/direction soon, and I'll be able to update my review."}
{"text":"My experience at Market Avenue Wine Bar was very unpleasant.  In short: the waitress was extremely unfriendly/ rude and sent my partner and I packing.  In long:  My partner and I came here with the intention of ordering appetizers and having a few drinks on the patio. It was crowded, and as we tried to make our way to a table, my partner nearly bumped into a waitress. His profuse apology was met with nothing but a disparaging scowl. The waitress then grunted, \"We'll need to see your ID's.\" We responded, \"Of course,\" but as we were taking them out of our wallets, she turned and walked away without a word, so we proceeded to sit down at the table.  Without introducing herself or the restaurant, she returned, hastily throwing two menus upon the table before immediately defecting again. When she finally came back, she stated curtly, \"I need to see your ID's.\"  Again, as we are both of legal drinking age (I was 23 at the time; he was 27), we responded complacently and handed her our driver's licenses.  She then handed them back and told us we needed to leave. When I asked her why, she said, \"I just don't buy it.\"  Having never encountered this situation before, I responded, \"What don't you buy? We're both of legal drinking age. Do you want a second form of ID?\" She said, \"No, just leave.\"  I asked, \"Can you please explain your reason for asking us to leave?\"  She couldn't. She simply stated, \"We won't serve you. You need to leave, now. There are other places you can go.\"  And that is exactly what we did. We ended up eating at Crop Bistro just down the street on Loraine Avenue, and it was absolutely phenomenal- delectable food, delicious drinks, incredible atmosphere, and most importantly, excellent service.  Honestly, I can't speak to the quality of the food or drinks at Market Avenue, but the waitress was so discourteous to us from the moment we walked in that I could hardly justify dining there under any circumstances. I don't believe it is fair to make assumptions about the intentions of others, but I was left curious as to whether or not our barring from this establishment was related to our being openly gay. The entire affair left me personally offended and a little hurt.  With such amazing options nearby, why risk encountering the abhorrent service and outright rudeness of the waitstaff at  Market Avenue Wine Bar?  Enjoy a fine evening somewhere more friendly."}
{"text":"One star for the experience. We did not stay to eat or drink. As visitors to Cleveland we landed from Boston at 10pm and Yelped a wine bar. Approaching the area it seemed sketchy, but Market Ave seemed interesting, inviting and fun. We sat outside to enjoy the beautiful summer evening. And waited for a waitress. And waited. The next thing we knew a man came up and peed in front of the restaurant door. Yes. Unzipped his pants and peed.  No one who worked there said a word.  We stood up and walked away......"}
{"text":"During our 4 years in Avon lake we made it here 3 or 4 times. this is a wonderful little (and it is a small establishment) bar with an extensive wine selection. Twice we had a cheese plate which was very good.  Nice place for some quiet reflection and relaxation.  Right down the street from Great Lakes Brewing and across the street from Flying Fig."}
{"text":"They have a great little space in the back that you can rent out for private events. The space has a coffee shop feel with eclectic groups of tables and chairs that are great for mingling. Staff was a good balance of laid back and attentive. Large wine menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Market Avenue Wine Bar completely by accident last night (we initially wanted to try a restaurant we hadn't been to for restaurant week and picked flying fig - but alas, they were completely booked for the night). So we walked into Market Avenue and said \"we'll just check the menu\". Walked in to a very cute, but small wine bar with dimmed lighting and a very friendly bartender! As soon as we saw \"baked brie\" and all of the bottles of wine, we were sold.   We asked the waiter for suggestions - I wish I remembered his name, because he was PHENOMENAL and totally deserves all the credit for picking our wines and legit knowing what he was talking about! My friend got a riesling and loved his choice. I asked which Cab he would suggest and without hesitation, he said Owen's Roe - Sharecropper... so of course I got it. Loved it. So much so that I called later when I got home to ask the name again. And, he said they do sell bottles if I wanted to go back in and buy a bottle or two.... which I may probably be doing within the next week.  We ordered baked brie and three dips - hummus, olive tapenade, and an herb cheese dip. Both plates came with a loaf of sliced bread... each.... so we definitely carbo loaded (but for real, I feel really bad for all of that bread that was wasted, wish they had only brought out one and told us we could request more if we needed)... But anyways, the baked brie was delicious. It came with a TON of fresh sliced fruit which was wonderful. As far as the dips go, I loved the olive tapenade most, then the hummus... I wasn't too fond of the herb cheese.   I was SO happy Flying Fig was booked up for the night and I was SO happy we spotted the wine bar next door!! I can't wait to go back - I think I saw a room in the back... birthday party???"}
{"text":"I think this is an often overlooked dinner venue in Cleveland. It gets overshadowed by the big places in Ohio City, but it is really a great place.   Private and relaxed seating - great for a romantic date or heavy gossip with a girlfriend.   Large, well priced wine selection.   Friendly staff - being a small place you get personalized service and the opportunity to taste before you buy a glass.   Food is a great surprise. Simple, good, inexpensive. It complements the wine without stealing the show."}
