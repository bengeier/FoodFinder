{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this new place out and are SO GLAD that we did! The entire experience was wonderful - from the friendly staff to the welcoming atmosphere and let's not forget the pizza! We tried the PPC square pizza. This place nailed it. Tasted just like the pizza I grew up with in Pittsburgh (a little better in my opinion). The crust was crispy and the sauce and cheese tasted fresh. We can't wait to go back and try out some of their sandwiches! Hard-working staff, clean restaurant, and delicious pizza...can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Great experience! We had pizza with mushrooms, meatball, and salad. All were delicious, but the Pittsburgh salad with the house dressing was something I'm still craving!  The restaurant was spotless which is a must for me. The decor was fun to check out and definitely representative of Pittsburgh. Service was outstanding. Try it if you haven't!  Hopefully it won't be too long until I make it back to the area for more goodies from Pittsburgh Pizza Company!"}
{"text":"New, little, family owned pizza shop. Definitely has a friendly vibe to it, the employees seemed very kind and checked that I was satisfied with my meal. They have a couple inexpensive, quick lunch specials if you are in a hurry. Also, the six piece and family size signature, square pizzas are a yummy change of pace which I haven't seen before.  On a busy night it may take a couple extra minutes to get your pizza than some places. However, they cook everything fresh using quality ingredients. So, to me it's worth a little longer wait for better taste. When I went in the other day they had just gotten two nice, big tvs installed. And they have good priced bottles of beer and wine. So I'll be frequenting during football season for sure!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and were curious when we saw a business advertising a Pittsburgh connection. Being from the suburbs over in East Liverpool, Ohio, we were excited to try it.   When it opened, we were not disappointed. Turns out Adam, the owner was from our neighboring town of Steubenville. He had even worked in our favorite local pizza shop, Bruno's, for a while in preparation for opening his own shop. The pizza is rectangular and made in a tray, just like back home. The flavors and style are very reminiscent of Orlando's Pizza in ELO. Just such a great nostalgic taste of home. We instantly felt like we had made a friend and were part of the family.   Also, check out the buffalo chicken pizza. Great flavors with a bit of a kick!"}
{"text":"We got a coupon for a free hoagie roll sandwich, buy one get one free. I got the Italian roast beef, my husband got the meatball and an order of fries. The hoagies were terrible, the roast beef tasted like it came out of a can, the au jus tasted like low sodium beef broth. The meatballs were soft and flavorless, the sauce tasted like Ragu. The fries were saturated with oil, under seasoned, and soggy. Not to mention our sodas were flat. I'm glad we didn't pay full price for this slop."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in Pittsburgh, I was very excited to check out PPC and get a taste of home.  The pizza was great and the staff was awesome.  I was only disappointed that chicken wings weren't on the menu (AK Valley style to be specific!)! Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Have been meaning to visit this place, as it is only a few blocks from home. We eat plenty of pizza, and are always looking to try something new. We tried their 16\" family style pizza with various toppings.  The crust was not too thick, not too thin and  nice and crispy on the edges. Sauce was tasty, but not impressed with canned mushrooms.  I love supporting family businesses, but for the $21 this pizza cost, I could have had twice as much pizza from many other places."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice in the past week, extremely friendly staff, very clean restaurant, and awesome food! Hands down the \"Yinz Gotta Try\" this sandwhich is the best! Order it \"Pittsburgh Style\" trust me you won't be disappointed. The pizza is incredible, the sauce is extremely flavorful, and the crust is amazing! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Reasonable prices.   Good addition to the neighborhood.  Service was fast and employees were courteous."}
{"text":"Just picked up a buffalo chicken ranch pizza and although the crust is great and toppings delicious it wasn't hot. The cheese was not cheesy it was solid and cool. This is my first experience with them so will give them another shot because the crust and toppings were so good. Hope they don't disappoint next time!"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner at Pittsburgh Pizza Company for the first time.  We had to give it a try when we found it as 3 out of the 4 of us were raised in Pittsburgh.  It was really good.  We all enjoyed our meals.  The meatball hoagie was yummy with the right amount of seasonings in the meatballs.  The French fries were fresh, not the frozen junk you get some places.  And yes, I took a bite of my husband's pizza.  Really good.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  We had excellent service.  They were very attentive up until the moment we left.  The walls have photos of Pittsburgh and some of the d√©cor features Pittsburgh products.  It brought back a lot of memories.  The prices are great and they offer specials.  Yinz just have to come."}
{"text":"sorry, just did not like it. Did enjoy the crispy crust but the tomato sauce just killed it for me, it was bitter and in general the pizza was flavorless. I'll try it again sometime just to be sure but really can't recommend it at this point.  EDITED TO ADD: the shop is now closed (big surprise there NOT), there is another pizza joint at the same location. No idea if it is the same people or if someone bought the place from them. No idea if the new pizza is any better than the awful, old pizza."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is delicious! I've been back for three days in a row now and will likely be in tomorrow for their $1.50 beers on Thursday. It was fate!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great people, great place. Do not drive by this place. Phoenix is very limited in good pizza if you are from back east. This place has it right."}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgh native I had to try this place out!  Staff was extremely friendly, the place is immaculately clean, and nicely decorated for a casual pizza place.  We got carry out meatball appetizer and the Yinzer sandwich.  The meatball appetizer came with only 2 meatballs- but they were HUGE!  They were packed with flavor with a bit of red sauce- simple and delicious.  The Yinzer was a take on a \"Pittsburgh style\" sandwich... It was very good as well.  Very filling- we split one sandwich and were stuffed!  They apparently make everything from scratch and take great pride in that!  I would like to go back to try their pizza and a meatball sub!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor to another local haunt near Pittsburgh Pizza Company, and I was very happy to see a new Pizzeria coming to the neighborhood.    I have never been to Pittsburgh PA., and I was curious how Pittsburgh Pizza would compare to New York Style or Chicago Style.  For the record, I am a fan of Pittsburgh Pizza and the Pittsburgh Pizza Company.  The Crust; Perfect.  The Sauce; Outstanding.  The Service; Great. Cleanliness; Top Notch.  Pittsburgh Pizza Company, \"Thanks for finally opening, and welcome to the neighborhood!\""}
{"text":"I loved this place and it was very close to home. Last Friday I was looking forward all day to ordering one. But when I called the lady that answered the phone said the pizza place was no longer there. I have not driven by to look. They just added a sit down bar so it seems weird they closed. Can anybody confirm this?"}
{"text":"Listen... the ONLY reason this place gets 3 stars is because the people are SO nice! Stopped in here for lunch and I'm here to tell ya the square pizza the do for the lunch special is hands down the worst attempt at pizza I've ever had... and I've had Cici's Pizza Buffet. I had the sausage and this dingbat I was with had pepperoni. My sausages were tiny little flavorless pieces that looked more like browned ground beef. The pepperoni was even more ridiculous!  About the size of a melted penny. They did have a real nice crunch to them . So I guess I'll be back to try something else because there is no way anything else can be as bad as what passes for pizza inside these walls!"}
{"text":"Who knew that there was a Pittsburgh-style pizza? It's cooked in a square pan, with a thin, crispy crust. The sauce is really mild and the cheese is, too. Different, not bad.  We went to this new spot on a Saturday night. 15 minutes before closing. The folks there chatted us up and told us what we were in for. They promised that everything is fresh and made in-store.   We enjoyed our sausage pizza and had plenty more for a couple of lunches. Them price was right and the pizza is good. There are a few killer pizzas in the neighborhood, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Being from OH and having family in PA and WV, this was a fun addition to the neighborhood.  I'd never had Pittsburgh Pizza, but for those that have had Youngstown Pizza, they should feel right at home here. The crust and the sauce can come across a bit bland, but the intent is to let the toppings shine.  In Youngstown they call it the Old World style.  And if you're looking for the best sandwich in Phoenix, you gotta try the Yin'z!!!  Five stars for this alone.  Unless you are very hungry, it's great for sharing."}
{"text":"DOESNT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR!  White pizza comes with sliced tomatoes and pickeled banana peppers (vomit)  Asked for garlic.  NO GARLIC. so we asked why no garlic? was told...  ITS NOT ON THE MENU! well geez you could have said something.   AND THE CHEESE?  CHEESE?  definitly NOT CHEESE!  NOT GOING BACK...."}
{"text":"Have been living in this neighborhood for almost 5 years and during that time there has been no local pizza places so I was excited when I saw this place. Stopped in tonight and ordered a 2 topping 16 inch normal pie to go. We sat in the restaurant to wait and talked with one of the staff who was very friendly. The interior was small and sparsely decorated but clean. Since we were the only ones there we didn't have to wait very long for our order to be ready.   Upon opening the box I was a little disappointed with the appearance and of the fact that canned mushrooms were used. The cheese, which was a bit sparse, was melted but not very melted. The sauce was tasty and the crust was nice and crispy. On the whole it was not the worse pizza I have ever had but at 20 buck for a 16 in it was a bit pricey for what it was.  Conclusion: I will chalk the first experience up to the restaurant having just opened and I will try it again in a few weeks but I do hope that some of the things that were not great will improve."}
{"text":"Don't trust the one star reviews. This pizza had nice flavor and the Pittsburgh style crust is to die for.  The Buffalo chicken pizza is new and we fell in love. The crust is light and crispy . Check this place out. Oh and another big plus. They serve beer and wine!"}
{"text":"Just had chicken parmwich and buffalo chicken pizza ... Was amazing, great food and service"}
{"text":"I had a PPC 6pc signature pizza with pepperoni and PPC special salad.  This place is not Pizzeria Bianco and it is not trying to be but  it was economical and tasty.  I love the family atmosphere and I am glad the area has another sorely needed Mom n Pop place to eat.   I will come again to try something else."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The pizza was just OK. We ordered our pizza for take out and had to put it in the oven when we got home because it was undercooked."}
{"text":"I came back to check out the pizza again.  Like i said in my previous review the sauce still leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe seasoning it up a little more or adding something else in there? (garlic?)  Anyways, it was really nice to see that they have been working on their menu and beefing it up since the last time. They have visuals for you on what type of pizza to order. I like that. Nice small and easy fixes that makes me able to leave this at a 4 star.  I love this place IN COMPARISON to pizza hut and dominos. I would put them in this pizza circuit and rating system. Their prices are fair, and I would definitely frequent this place if I had children who wanted pizza. Its a healthier less greasy choice than the aforementioned pizza places.The 4 stars is the experience and overall pizza.   This would not make my list for sitdown gourmet pizza places. I don't think that is their intended market to compete with those pizza places. I think they intend to go against the \"fastfood pizza\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we would check this place out to support local new business. We ordered a square pizza with one topping that was on the promotional coupon we used.  We ordered it to go and waited only 5 minutes. The box wasn't hardly warm. I believe they warmed up an order that never was served earlier. The pizza was not bad but will not be back. Paid  $10.99 after $2.00 off coupon and had 6 small pieces. I would think you would put more pride into a Mom & pop operation."}
{"text":"The wife and I got the 16 piece Pittsburgh pizza,  half pepperoni half mushroom and a dozen Buffalo wings. First, the pizza. Sauce is a 10, crust is a 10, cheese and toppings are a 9. Good balance of flavors. The wings were also excellent! The only gripe is the ranch (not homemade, too sweet) and the price. $12.99 for a dozen wings is a little steep. Other than that, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'll be back! Finally a place that knows how to cook and season a thick crust pizza. The Meatball with mushroom Pittsburgh style rocked."}
