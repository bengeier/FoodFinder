{"text":"Worst cupcakes. I've tried the salted Caramel and the marshmallow cupcakes. The cream on both was very dense but bland. The salted caramel cupcake just tasted like chocolate cake aside from a tiny dollop of caramel in the middle. Disappointing. The marshmallow was just strange. I can't even place what it tasted like but it wasn't marshmallow. The white cake base also had a funny aftertaste. Overall I would not get these cupcakes. Even grocery store cupcakes are better."}
{"text":"Delicious, top quality ingredients and creative flavors. Follow them on twitter for dates & locations. I had the salted caramel buttercream vanilla cupcake. Moist, fresh, buttery, with a salty caramel surprise inside. I brought a half-dozen home for the in-laws who are huge bakery fans and CB got thumbs-up all around."}
{"text":"It's the rare cupcake that's worth it.  These ones are.  I'm actually thinking of tracking this truck down somewhere to have them again!"}
{"text":"What a great day for a cupcake!  I went to check out the Queen West Art Crawl in Trinity Bellwoods Park and a bunch of food trucks were there. It was a nice sunny afternoon to look at some art, eat lunch on the grass, and finish off the afternoon with a little treat.  Of the options they had this afternoon (some gluten free!) I went out of my norm at tried a cotton candy cupcake. It's a vanilla cake with sweet cotton candy flavoured icing, topped with a piece of cotton candy. The cake was super moist and not at all crumbly, perfect really. The icing was tasty, but I would have liked the cotton candy flavour to come through stronger.  For a mere $2.75, this is a great cupcake."}
