{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere with a fantastic location and an amazing view, doesn't get better than that. friendly staff, straight forward menu along with delicious treats whether it be coffee or eats.
Tried espresso, flat white and beef sandwich.
Espresso was rich and creamy, delicious, nothing compared to what you get from your run of the mill coffee shop.
The flat white was probably the most amazing coffee infused drink I have had in my life, smooth with a rich silky flavor/texture.
The beef sandwich was so delicious, and the portion was just perfect.
Lastly, great prices!!
If you are a coffee lover like me and a people's person this place is a must. I will be going back again and again for the flat white that's for sure."}

Very nice interior. Cool and trendy. Great service. Tried a Cortado....since this is the new trend at Cafes now. And boy was i glad i did. Rich espresso with perfect amount of milk. 
Was in a rush so did not have time to 'people-watch' but will try something else next time."}
