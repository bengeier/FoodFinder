{"text":"I want to make love to your cheese buns. Not just sex. Love. Also, I am lactose intolerant. My life is in shambles."}
{"text":"Always love the cheese buns! 

I tried the almond tart, donut with raspberry filling and raisin buns today.
They are all good, cannot stop eating!"}
{"text":"Place is excellent. Probably the best small bakery in the city. If you want artisan bread... There are slightly better places. And there are better cupcake places too... But this place has it all in one place. 

And the cinnamon bread. Seriously. Fantastic."}
{"text":"The addictive properties of the cheese buns from Glamorgan Bakery are well known to those of us in the Southwest. This addiction, it seems, has no cure. Nor should it! These delectable buns, made fresh daily in store, are often still warm when you buy them. And rest assured, they rarely get much of an opportunity to cool. They are so good that they have replaced a bottle of wine as an offering at potluck get-togethers. Sure, your host may think you're cheap, but once they're opened, they're always the first item to disappear, and they are always raved about. I could go on about the cheese buns, but I think you get the point. 
Besides their heavenly buns, they also have a wide selection of breads, pastries, cookies and cakes. Additionally, they offer both sweet and savoury pies. The only other thing I would add is make sure to load up on Saturday, as they are closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Crikey. I've been to quite a few bakeries in this side of the world. Let me tell you, so many bakeries in Canada churn out dull and literally tasteless goods compared to the bakeries back home (And us Brits are meant to be the ones with the bland food!)

Thank goodness Glamorgan Bakery breaks the trend!

I honestly thought the hype about the cheese buns was just chatter, but oh. my. goodness. They are fantastic! I'll chime in with the others and say you have to try a pack of these! (I'll freely admit that a bag of these buns DO NOT last more than an hour in my household. Good thing I live so darn close then!)

Of course I've tried a few other of their products, but the cheese buns just stand way out in front!

Kudos to the owners for raising the bar higher!

(Now where is my credit card. I'm craving some cheese related baked goods now...)"}
{"text":"Glamorgan Bakery has a ton of cakes in the windows, but to be honest, their cakes aren't very good. The mint chocolate one is decent but that's about it.

My favorite Glamorgan item is their shortbread cookies. They're to die for-- simple but amazing, pure shortbread with glazed icing. I miss them so bad. They also make amazing cinnamon bread and cinnamon twists."}
{"text":"The thing I love about this bakery is that you can tell everything is made by hand and not mass produced. The donuts are not perfectly round and the buns can be different shapes. 

The cheese buns are wonderful and apparently world famous. The variety of other baked goods is great. They have the best fluffy scones I have bought from a bakery but make sure to get there early for the best selection. Cinnamon buns with and without raisins, glazed cinnamon twists, cookies galore etc. You can even buy a large box of their cheese buns frozen to cook at home when you want a fresh one. 

They also have a great selection of Dutch treats like sugar bread (baked only on Fridays) and house made Stroopwaffels. 

The service is also very good, they are always busy but have lots of staff behind the counter and I find I am never left waiting for very long as the staff are very good at juggling the customers so that you are not waiting. 

It is worth the drive across the city for a visit as long as you don't expect mass produced \"beautiful\" baked goods you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good bakery tucked in away in a little strip mall. I love their cheese buns. They absolutely melt in your mouth. Their pies are pretty good too. The rest of the other stuff is standard bakery fare and didn't appeal to me much. This bakery is by far the typical neighbourhood bakery in that they don't have a lot of gourmet stuff. But the cheese buns alone are worth the drive for!"}
{"text":"Holy cheese buns! The Florentine cookies are pretty outta this world too! So happy someone recommended this place to me. I'll drive there from the SE anytime. So so good."}
{"text":"A bright spot in an otherwise dying market segment: locally owned neighborhood bake shops.  I like that the items are all slightly and uniquely irregularly shaped, that way I can pretend I made them myself! A standard assortment of cookies, squares, rolls and breads are available, with fast and friendly service. Besides much deserved praise for the cheese buns, it is worth noting that every couple weeks they make hard to find specialty items such as Dutch sugar bread (which my Dutch acquaintances rave about)."}
{"text":"Two foods to describe how great they are CHEESE BUNS!!!!  So yummy!  I think most people could eat an entire bag of them in their own. Wherever you live, it's worth the drive. Don't get me wrong though, they have a lot of other great things to like their chocolate cake."}
{"text":"This place has the best of a lot of things. The chocolate ganache cake is amazing. Everyone keep asking me where I got it from. All I keep hearing was \"wow this is soooo good\" \"good job on ordering the cake\" It was a big hit!!"}
{"text":"the best cheese buns in the world!
i've been going to this bakery for 30yrs.
CHEESE EVERYWHERE, get a dozen cause 6 will be gone before you leave the parking lot!"}
{"text":"I hosted my annual Thanksgiving pie give away party and instead of ordering from sunterra I ordered from this Bakery I met the owner she was pleasant as were excellent she even gave me a sample of each pie to take home for the weekend before I decided and I also only use them for the venue we ordered more than 50 pies and I'll definitely be using them again next year they are an amazing little Bakery I love supporting local businesses"}
{"text":"I ordered a Black Forest Cake from Glamorgan Bakery for my wife's birthday. When I arrived to pick it up they informed me that they keep them in the freezer and that I should leave it out for a few hours to thaw before serving. I was very concerned that the process of freezing and thawing would result in an unappealing taste and texture. Boy was I wrong; my wife said it was the best Black Forest cake she has ever had! I was also impressed with the pleasant and efficient service that the staff provided to the customers. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I dream about those cheese buns!  The cookies are delicious.  The Blueberry scones - so good!  The cakes...okay.  But damn those buns!"}
{"text":"Okay, so the cheese buns are good. And by good I mean I would push you down and snatch the last bag if I had to and not even bat an eyelash. But the Glamorgan Bakery is more than their buns, people! Stop being so linear in your thinking!

They have cakes, cookies, bread, eclairs, cupcakes, tarts - oh my! I don't know if they are all as good as the cheese buns as I haven't eaten my way through ever category yet but so far so good.  I recently picked up some eclairs for a Valentine's treat for the man. Eclairs can be hit and miss based on the filling and the chocolate used and they were definitely a hit! No oily fake cream filling here! Yum.

What I like best though about the bakery is that  it is run by regular, real people. Its isn't pretentious, it isn't overly merchandised with sleek looking designer shelves. Its like the old school bakeries you'd find in any small town, where you know them by name and they always greet you with a smile. The prices are great too, especially given the quality.

It can seem a little tricky when you come in to know where to order or get in line but everyone there is so happy (customers included) it doesn't get the crazy chaotic feel.

Unless of course they ever ran out of cheese buns."}
{"text":"Bought a half slab cake which was quite a bit smaller and thinner than bakery standards considering the price should be easy to supply proper size cake was ok nothing to get excited about my wife could have made better ( she was ill at the time cake needed ) needless to say we won't be back"}
{"text":"They get 5 stars for their cheese buns!!! I would cross the border and fly to Calgary just to buy these cheese buns!!!!  I dream about their cheese buns."}
{"text":"Cheesebuns and Texas doughnuts ! 
This bakery has a steady stream of customer's.  It's been open for like ever.
Great reliable place to get you baked goods.
They will even accomadate food allergies."}
{"text":"How did I not know? How, Yelpers, how? I had never heard boo about Glamorgan cheese buns. Nothing. Then I moved into a rental down the street. The owner mentioned that we should try the cheese buns. I though \"Meh...how good can they be?\" My son loves Co-op cheese buns. I'm sure they're just as good, right? WRONG.

Glamorgan cheese buns are phenomenal...and magical. You buy a whole bag & they disappear like smoke. It's an amazing trick...you should see for yourself."}
{"text":"Treat yo self to the cheese buns.  Best buns in the city!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna let you in on our city's best kept secret. You ready for this?

Wanna know where to find THE best cheese buns in Calgary?

Two words Yelpers: Glamorgan Bakery.

Trish L. isn't kidding when she says they melt in your mouth. OH MY GAWD.

I've been there a million times by now and I've never even tried anything else. I know what I like, or in this case love, and their cheese buns are DA SHIT.

Okay, so I told you. Now whacha gonna do about it? The ball's in your court."}
{"text":"Having worked in a small independent bakery, I have a bit of a weakness for these smaller bakeries that aren't attached to a grocery store of any sort. The pies here have been quite good, and so have the cheese buns. It's best to get here early in the day before stuff gets sold out (it's also when things are the most fresh).

I haven't had much else here. I tend to be a pie addict, and I'd heard lots about their cheese buns from others (most of whom weren't on Yelp). So that's what I tend to gravitate towards. Their jelly filled doughnuts aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I don't care where you live in Calgary you need to try these chese buns. If you have to drive for 3 hours to get some of these chewy cheesy masterpieces home to your family, so be it. Sacrifices must be made. 

I've lived in the area for many years. I recommend the bakery to everyone I know. Family run, local, the fresh pasteries, breads, cakes and cookies are second to none."}
{"text":"Pricey and smaller; overall taste isn't as good as it used to be  e.g. eclair choclate is waxy and cream was bland.  Hard to find an old school bakery in this city so I was generous with the 3 stars"}
{"text":"The cheesebuns are the most amazing thing in Calgary. The cheddar is sharp and oily and folded throughout the dough. These are unlike any other cheesebun I have ever had and every time I make the trip to Calgary I try to stop by to indulge."}
{"text":"They were able to deliver on my daughter's unique cake request and the cake was DELICIOUS. This bakery has now become my new birthday cake go-to."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's usually busy. The famous cheese buns are the star product of this bakery.

The donuts are actually really good too, but don't eat them in your car- the chocolate and sprinkles will fall off. 

We had gotten a Black Forest cake here, $21. The counter sales person said it is their regular chocolate cake with two layers of cherry filling and real Whipped cream. The layers were minuscule, the whipped cream was stiff, and the cake was tasteless and on the dry side. A huge fail.  

Other times we tried the cinnamon loaf: bland and not enough cinnamon. The cinnamon buns: were decent but since they put in a lot of raisins it made it sickening sweet and the dough is tough. 

The donuts are good, but all shapes are irregular.

The Apple slice bars are good too. 

Overall, the bakery is overrated. The shoppe is small and crowded.  For the buns alone, the trip is still worth it but the higher priced cakes are bland which make it more valuable to visit the Safeway next door if you need a cake."}
{"text":"Best bakery in Calgary by FAR! Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. Brings authenticity and takes you away from the generic and franchise flavours.
Butter cookies dipped in chocolate are definitely worth trying. Also the cheese buns are a must."}
{"text":"CHEESE BUNS!!!!! Soft, cheesy and delicious! $6.00/6 buns. Best when they come out warm. 

This place has a variety of desserts and bread. Grabbed a raisin roll bag for the road and it didn't dissapoint. Filledddd with raisins and super soft. They serve donuts, mini cakes, sausage rolls, etc. Small place, but quick service."}
{"text":"I love having this place close to home - reasonable prices, and it's great to see a bakery that still kicks it old school."}
{"text":"Yah best cheese buns in the city for sure. But my fave is the little mini sausage rolls. Those are the bomb. Yah I agree with Jason G , they must stick something addictive in them, cause I could eat a half dozen myself."}
{"text":"Hi Yelpers!

Glamorgan Bakery has a large variety of cookies, buns, breads and everything in between. All the pastries look very tempting, for years it was the delicious shortbread dipped in dark chocolate that kept me coming back.... The con: the place is a oven, they really need to invest in a air condition system, seriously!

Sadly sometime in January I was diagnosed with Celiac's Disease which was devastating because I LOVE Wheat products, life without cheese buns, pasta and cookies just wasn't going to work. So I approached the bakery on a slow time, to see if they'd accommodation GF pastries in their bakery or by special request?! 

To my Shock they informed me 100% of all their goods have Gluten and the management was not about to change their ways. I might add the lady behind the counter was in a tank-top and short-shorts (during December), she left me feeling like I was a nusense."}
{"text":"excellent bakery.  Large selection of breads/sweets.  the cheese buns are what i went for, and they are quite good."}
{"text":"I have been in here many times and ordered Cake as well; what I can say is that Cakes are not their greatest thing but their Shortbread cookies are amazing; they have lots of different shortbread cookies; price is also really good. I know they have cheese buns, bread, cake loafs, etc. but never tried."}
{"text":"Saw reviews and called on a whim for a birthday cake.  Been going here ever since. The chocolate cake is perfection to what I like, and I have recommended it several times. If you like chocolate, you really should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Glamorgan Bakery has been around for a long time dating back to 1977. I wouldn't doubt that the decor has remained the same since day 1; it's an old school, no frills, traditional bakery.

They specialize in Dutch baking so lots of options including their famous cheese buns, Texas style doughnuts, cakes, breads and pastries. They were out of fresh cheese buns when we came on a late Saturday afternoon. That didn't stop us though; we took a dozen frozen to go.

- Cheese buns ($6.00/dozen) - I was gifted two cheese buns to bring back home to try from K. Not much else to say other than they're delicious! Soft, chewy, cheesy with a touch of oiliness to them.

I'll have to come back and try a few more things next visit."}
{"text":"I have been in to check out this place pre-Christmas and just yesterday - needed items for upcoming parties.  While I did not purchase anything I can not comment on the 'taste'.  However, I can comment on the 'appeal' of their baked goods.  I found the selection lacking in appeal of their products.  The product looks sloppy and lacking in creativity.  I've been to other bakeries in the city to find enticingly wonderful offerings.  

I would not go here to purchase something for a dinner party, or anytime I want to 'impress' etc., Perhaps an 'everyday' thing as their prices are quite reasonable it seems - as the taste must be good considering all the 5 stars for this place=)"}
{"text":"Hmmm the cheese buns are to die for!!! 

They are the best I have eaten. 

At work, someone brought in cheese buns and the fruit bars. Both were sooo good that they quickly became the 'special treat' on a hard day that would cheer everyone up! (We are such emotional eaters haha :P). 

Seriously.... The cheese buns are sooooo soft, buttery, and cheesy... With all those nooks and crannies filled with delicious melted cheesy goodness.... Drooool."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I really do.  The cheese and bacon buns are simply one of those things that I wouldn't mind being buried to death in (ok, I know, macabre thought).  Sooo freakin' rich, cheesy and salt lovin' goodness, I purposely restrict myself from these except on special weekends when I need the carbs and yummy goodness such as during my dragon boat festivals.

Of everything else, in all honesty, I wish I can tell you, which is why I'm giving a 4 instead of 5 stars.  The simple truth is that there are so many things to simply worship in a good ol' fashioned bakery way (nothing fru fru, nothing gourmet, just plain ol' breads of all sorts, cookies, simple cakes and of course the freakin' awesome cheese buns or the even better cheese and bacon buns.

Now I've read a few comments about how they don't offer anything Gluten free, but then at least they're honest about it.  With a product selection as it is, and the fact that to ensure a gluten free area would mean a heck of a lot of work to ensure a safe zone unadulterated by normal flour, I'm really not too surprised.  Sorry guys if you are hoping for a Glamorgan gluten free line, but Lakeside Bakery near North Glenmore park does offer all that and more!

Damn. Now I'm craving these things... and the next dragon boat fest for me is several weeks away.  I need an excuse!!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you'll smell the goodness.  I've heard they have the best cheese buns in the city and I have to agree.  They also sell the cheese buns in a bake at home version."}
{"text":"It's been years since I last came here. I used to live close by and came all the time, but now that I'm on the other side of the city I just never seem to make it.

My wife was craving their cheese buns, which are magnificent. While I was there I thought I would try some other things so I grabbed a Texas doughnut and some cinnamon buns. There's so many delicious looking things that I had a hard time limiting myself to only a few. Definitely do not go here hungry.

Everything was great. I was in on a weekday afternoon so there were a few people in the store but it wasn't overly busy. They had a few staff working so I didn't have to wait long to get my purchase done."}
{"text":"We are so impressed. We have not used Glamorgan bakery for years and, believe it or not, my husband, on his own initiative, brought home Christmas cookies and other goodies from the bakery. They were FABULOUS. We goobled up everything. I went there the next day to get some of those wonderful cream filled pastries and the staff were so nice. Everyone there was smiling and it was just such a pleasant experience. The store was very busy but we were all helped in record time as far as I could tell. I WILL DEFINITELY BE GOING HERE FOR OUR SPECIAL OCCASIONS."}
{"text":"Quality is not what it previously was. Had some butter-tarts that where over baked - for the price I don't feel they are trying very hard."}
{"text":"Fantastic bakery offerings.  If you haven't had the cheese buns here you aren't living. 

They offer different kinds of cheese buns too - like PIZZA CHEESE buns.  OMG, deliciousness. 

There are TONS of variations of cookies and cakes and they even have Texas doughnuts.   Talk about bringing me back to my childhood.   More of a traditional bakery with cakes that are cute, not the modern tall, sleek cakes but so tasty. 

A must visit when you're in the area, or in Calgary!"}
