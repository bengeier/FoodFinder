{"text":"This is a friendly, charming and unique  cafe.  The staff is always friendly and fun.  They offer a great variety of drinks - those seeking caffeine or not - teas and fruit drinks.   There are couches or tables to have an friendly sit down or a business meeting.  And they engage in the community!  It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is a great community coffee house located on the North Side.  I like to have meetings here because there is tons of space, free wireless and it is easy to find parking.  Coffee, drinks and food. There is interesting art work on the walls.  Tables and chairs for meetings and couches for reading a book.  They often host some interesting events too."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood cafe to come in, say hi to friends and stay for a bit to chat or use their free wi-fi.  Their coffee is great and the atmosphere encourages you to stay a while and relax."}
{"text":"Just stumbled on this place after finding Penn Brewery closed for Saturday lunch. Very friendly service, good latte, didn't have the advertised item right (listed on sign at counter) so we went with a panini sandwich. It was good and they also had all you can eat waffles on this day. Service (coffee is slower than we are used to so allow for that). Won't make a special trip to this place but if we are in the area we will certainly stop."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I went into this coffee shop for a simple cup of coffee. I've had better coffee brewed at a convenience store.   I saw an advertisement for all you can eat waffles, that could be this establishments saving grace."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Exceedingly friendly, great drinks, very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great food.  I didn't have great expectations, considering the aesthetics; however, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I'm a coffee and food snob and both were great.  I will definitely visit again and again.  Thanks for providing great food and beverage and service.  Kudos to the owners and service staff."}
{"text":"A great little coffee shop a block north of East Ohio Street. The staff is always super nice, and love being able to sit out front (and in the shade!) when it's warmer."}
