{"text":"Gonna be short and sweet!  Stopped in here with some friends to grab something quick.  We all sat at the bar.  Great service, great food.  Definitely will be back!  Meatballs - yup!   Jalapeno Popper Dip - Not too spicy, but we have a high tolerance.  Very good! Bruschetta - We tried the Mozz.  Very good.   Cocktails - reasonably priced and strong  Will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.  Worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Visited today and what a treat. Kelly's is very warm and comfortable. Sofas, pool table and a man cave. It does not get any better. Service was excellent , drinks were great. Did not get a chance to eat, but will be back Very Soon!!!!  Meet Brad the manager, great guy made us feel welcome. Kelly's is a great addition to south bridge of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pleasantly pleased with the layout and crowd at Kelly's during the weekends.  Have mostly been for drinks an people watching.  The huge wrap around bar makes for a great spread and the bartenders have a steady hand.  Have only eaten there once, but wow the apps were great.  Make sure to give them a go...Fingerling Potatoes, Ahi Tuna Tartare, Roasted Brussel Sprouts,  and the BBQ Short Rib Sandwich.  Kelly's steps up the Scottsdale atmosphere all at a great price point."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our middle aged selves out for a late afternoon of happy hour-ing this week with no particular plan or place in mind. Kelly's looked just about right so we toddled in and were seated at a table on the patio. Our server was prompt and courteous. Ordered off the happy hour menu, everything was four dollah. We only had a couple of beers, glass of wine and two apps. Might try it for dinner, but other Yelp reviews paint a completely different picture for evening festivities which may not be our cup of chardonnay.  Also have to agree with other reviewers about smokers on the deck. There were eight people on the deck while we were out there and half were smoking. UGH."}
{"text":"Kelly's used to be my favorite happy hour in town! Then when I had 8 colleagues in from out of town, Kelly's was the place I suggested. So imagine my surprise when I walk up to the door at 5 p.m. on a Monday night and the doors are locked! No one answered the phone and there wasn't any indication on social media that they would be closed. Guys, what happened? Thank goodness we have more happy hours in town. If Kelly's management can't be open during posted hours or explain why they were closed, I simply cannot be a patron anymore."}
{"text":"Wound up at Kelly's last night. Our server Sierra was fantastic and a total sweetheart. Even though the bar became pretty packed (Spring Training), the service was consistently great the whole time.We had the Haloumi cheese stuffed cherry peppers as well as Ahi tuna cups. Both appetizers were delicious.Cocktails were really good and we also sampled some Jameson whiskey and ginger ale from the Jameson girls. It was overall a younger crowd last night but there was enough of a mix that it made for great people watching."}
{"text":"I give this place a one star overall. The service is bad and the food/drinks are just OK. On my last visit they overcharged me $50 and management is always be too busy.  Beware and just to be safe keep a copy of your signed receipt."}
{"text":"I am originally from Scottsdale, but I live In NYC now.  I am in town and my parents took me to Kelly's last night.  I don't typically write reviews whether the restaurant is good or bad, but this place was so awful, I thought I owed it to society to warn you about this place.    Right when we showed up  the hostess looked like she had just gotten in a fight with her boyfriend and had a disgusted scowl on her face...she said we could sit anywhere.  Patio is nice so I was able to ignore the rude entrance.  We chose a table on the patio and it literally took 7 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our existence and finally bring us water.  Just as they did that, we realized the table cloth was absolutely filthy.  So we decided to just move to another table...once we sat down there, we realized that table was not sturdy at all and had to move to a 3rd table.  While this was going on, I mentioned to the waiter that we had to move bec the table cloth was filthy...2 minutes later I saw another waiter come and I was happy to see they were addressing the dirty cloth. However, I soon realized, instead of putting a clean cloth on, they just turned it inside out.  Same thing you would do with a stained couch cushion.  Moving along, we are now at our 3rd table and I could feel there was something strange under the cloth. I lifted the cloth up and the table looked to be at least 30 years old and was fully rotting away.  I still cannot understand how that table was not thrown out years ago, but I guess they figured a dirty table cloth would at least keep the customers from getting any splinters.  At this point I just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there.  I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare and I think to them that means to sear the meat for 5 seconds. It is pretty hard to screw up a cheeseburger, but they succeeded in this also.  It was awful and I didn't even eat 1/2 of it.  With all of this going on, the entire staff looked miserable and were extremely unfriendly.  I'm not sure if it was just a bad night for every single employee, but I work hard at my job and a smile is not too much to ask for.  I could probably type a lot more about my hour long experience at Kelly's, but hopefully this helps you avoid this place.  You could not pay me to go back and it definitely falls within my top 5 all time worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now.  First time sat at a high top booth table next to the window. This visit we sat at the comfy couched closer to the pool  table area. Both were really comfy and inviting.  The place is decked out for Christmas.  Couldn't stop myself from having the cheese board again !! It was soooooo good and BIG. This time our waitress was Ashlynn and she was awesome fitting lunch into our time constraint.  Also tried the mac and cheese with bacon it made my friends taste buds sing, but was a little too rich for me. Great shared item though.  Too bad we didn't have time to have some wine or dessert.  We will sure to be back when we have longer to stay."}
{"text":"Great drinks good service, patio was a good scene, nice place to chill and meet beautiful people"}
{"text":"Any establishment where the manager will pull aside a paying guest who made reservations well ahead for 20+ people to argue openly about said reservations, just no. No. Absolutely not. I've been in this industry long enough to know that's something that just does not happen. And when it does, you need to start your search for new FOH leadership because the current is an utter joke and on track to lose you thousands of dollars. Like tonight. Because I now know over 20 people who will never, ever come back. I wish there was a lower score I could give. But one star is acceptable purely based on our server. She did her very best. Always smiling, always willing to do whatever she could within her power to correct the relentless kitchen and management mistakes. She offered help where she could and was honest if she didn't have an answer but always offered an alternative to fix the situation. I wish I would've gotten her name but she was literally the only positive of the entire experience aside from a decent cocktail or two."}
{"text":"Slow service. Gross food. Fries were the best part out of all of our meals and we were with a group of 9. Thought no way someone could mess up a chicken sandwich, however I had to smother it in ranch to stomach it. They messed up our checks. Charged extra for everything we ordered. Manager came out and did nothing. Bathroom smelt like piss. Gross! Would never return or recommend this place EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great drinks! This bar is very cool because it has a variety of indoor and outdoor seating. Many different rooms with cute furniture and a pool table. The drinks are wonderful, I would highly recommend the Arizona Mule. I have not tried the food, but have heard great things from others about the food."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. I like the atmosphere and the servers were very easy going and laid back. It wasn't busy so the service was top notch though I have been there on nights it was slammed and they still managed to do a pretty good job. I will decently be back. Don't take offense it that it's only a four star rating. It's hard for me to give a five anywhere. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I split a burger, truffle fries, and onion rings on the patio for lunch on a Friday. The service was great and the bacon and blue cheese burger was outstanding. We had a relaxing, tasty meal and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service and food are pretty bad. I gave it two stars for the drinks.  When we arrived there was no hostess and we were standing there for a while. I had to go and get someone to help us out. Then, we got our food and the chicken tasted like plastic and the waitress never came to refill our drinks. We literally had to put our glasses at the edge of our table, and we only got them until we were done. No one came to ask if the food was okay and waited for a while for dessert and it was again really bad.  Also they were flying bugs in our table and we were not outside. :("}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood spot. I live a short walk away and am currently sitting at the bar because my cleaning lady is at home and I'd be nothing but in the way. If you're looking for a great relaxed happy hour where you can even get a little work done at the end of the day, this is the place. Sure it gets real busy at night, but this place has something for everyone. Lauren and Neil are awesome behind the bar. Always quick with a joke or a friendly smile, they make you feel like Norm at Cheers. The drinks are strong and the food is good. If you're looking for a departure from the regular old-town scene, Kelly's is a great place to start or end the night. Although, I'm sure they'd prefer you stay all night long, which can be fun too."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews about this place, some friends and I decided to try it. The food was AWFUL! I'm not sure if it was an \"off night\" but no one at our table enjoyed anything we ordered. We ordered the Mac & Cheese which was dry. The steak sandwich had some weird sweet sauce on it. The trilogy of bruschetta was really strange. It was 3 pieces of toast, one had cream cheese and jelly on it? The roasted chicken sandwich tasted like fruit loops. The only thing that was remotely edible was the simple salad. On the flip side, our server was really sweet, the drinks were great, and the atmosphere was nice. I'd come back, but only for drinks. Avoid the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome Ahi Tartar, mimosas, and bartenders ! Love going here whether it's during the week to chill, grab a quick bite, and a quick drink or to spend the day on the awesome patio on the weekend. Definitely a spot to make one of your regular spots. Never had a problem with food, staff, or venue.. I will continue to frequent. See you there ;)"}
{"text":"The Blue Burger was awesome.  Live music created a great atmosphere.  Our server Kera was very helpful!"}
{"text":"Went to Kellys for a birthday party. Slow service and overpriced.  Gave the waitress my credit card to run a tab and paid cash at the end of the night but my credit card was still charged. Also, if you go on a Saturday night the later it gets the more the douche bags are out."}
{"text":"We visited Kelly's tonight for dinner around 5:45pm. The restaurant has a beautiful patio, nice drink menu but below average food.  I ordered the sweet potato soup which was excellent and expected the rest of the meal to be the same.  However, my steak sandwich arrived luke warm at best and was room temp by my second bite.  The sauce on the steak was not good and the cut of meat was disappointing (the steak was in little slices like stir fry beef).  My husband ordered the chicken and squash ravioli that came floating in lightly flavored water (not sure what the sauce was supposed to have been).  And the music was way too loud and strange. This is not a place we'll visit again."}
{"text":"This place does not know how to make an Irish Coffee! At least the bartender the day we stopped in  had no idea. First they have no problem charging a premium price for their coffee...$3.00 for a cup and then $9.00 for the shot of the Jameson Irish Whiskey. The coffee tasted terrible (green!) we were told it was fresh brewed, the whiskey was either watered down or barely a 1/4 of a shot. For the whip cream they used powdered creamer. There were little lumps of creamer floating on top of the coffee.  I cannot recommend this restaurant/Bar. The food maybe ok but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I went to Kelly's early on a recent Saturday night with a group of four friends, as it had been recommended to us.  We wanted to have some drinks, try the food, and have a casual dinner before the weekend crowds hit.  This space is nicely decorated and comfortable, but I have to give the lowest review possible based on the restaurant's misguided policies.  One person in our group happened to order a Moscow Mule when our server was taking drink orders.  She said \"OK I'm just going to have to take your ID\".  We were so confused we all just kind of looked at each other, and my friend handed over his ID (was he being carded?  We were all in our 30s and 40s at the table).    It turns out, Kelly's assumes its customers are going to steal from them.  Our server informed us (when we asked why she needed to hold one person's driver's license) that the copper mugs they use in the Moscow Mules are \"very expensive\" and \"people steal them\".  I sort of waited for her to laugh, as I assumed she was joking... apparently she was dead serious.  If you assume that I'm going to steal from your establishment before I even walk in the door, you can be assured I'm not going to spend my money with you.    Kelly's was busy and full this Saturday night, and I'm sure they'll be successful without my business.  The five of us paid our drink bill, and walked across the street to Barrio Queen for a great dinner, where none of us were asked for collateral when we ordered."}
{"text":"Cool place, but extremely high on the Dbag meter for males. Its Scottsdale, but the Brosevelts are out and about so you've been warned,   You know; the 23K a year 'MMA fighter' tough guys. Affliction shirts, really?  Who actually/probably live with mommy in basement w/ their Xbox and GTA.  Weak"}
{"text":"This place is great! It has a large lounge area, with spacious private dining rooms and an enormous patio that faces the quaint small shops of Old Town Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is warm and weloming and the staff are very helpful."}
{"text":"Planned to come here last Monday for happy hour with a couple friends. Looked online to make sure it said they were open, which it did. Drove all the way there only to park and walk up to the door and find out they were closed. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Brussel Sprouts, Brussel Sprouts, Brussel Sprouts . . . The roasted brussel sprouts with candied pancetta is my absolute favorite dish at this restaurant. I will take just a moment to tell you that I am a big meat eater, so the that fact that I start with the words brussel sprouts . . . Means these are some of the best sprouts I have ever had in my life . . . Yes I said it and I mean it. I am also certified to make this statement, since most of my dinners are spent in restaurants across many many business travels, and the pots and pans in my kitchen look like they have never been used (thank you and don't judge). Kelly's is a great place to eat, everything I have tried has been very good. This time around, the weather in Scottsdale was gorgeous so my friend (who also swears by the brussel sprouts) and I went there twice while I was in town and requested a table outside on the patio.   We actually briefly argued about hogging the pancetta in our brussel sprouts dish.   Customer service is always good, atmosphere is friendly and inviting, they have a variety of cocktails and wines so this is a restaurant that I would recommend for a casual night out, a date, work lunches/ gatherings etc. Very relaxing place."}
{"text":"What I like about Kelly's is that it isn't a \"college bar\" like you'll find down the street in Old Town or on Mill.  It's very classy, with a great patio and a decent wine list.  At night it get busy and feels like a regular bar, but during the day it has a nice chill atmosphere.  What I dislike is the same I dislike about most Scottsdale venues; both patrons and the servers tend to think highly of themselves.  Everything is priced a little higher.  These aren't deal-breakers, but it's not something I go for if I can help it.  Last time I was here was a gorgeous Sunday afternoon, and our large group was offered a couch on the patio.  The ambiance and weather were perfect.  The server got us excited about half-priced bottles of wine (or champagne) and we ordered some.  It was quite lovely to sit back with good conversation and sip a nice merlot in the 75 degree sunshine.  I'm pretty sure we made it clear we weren't eating, but she kept asking if we were ready to order food.  When we asked for the bill, we realized the reason for her persistence was the fact that the half-priced bottles was only available with a food order.  Interesting tid-bit she left out at the beginning there.  We got a quick side of fries to solve that problem.  I would be unlikely to choose Kelly's if it were up to me, but I'll tag along if I'm invited.  I have no major complaints, it just doesn't quite seem worth the price (if you miss one of the specials or fail to order food)."}
{"text":"We stopped here with a large family group for a light lunch & drinks. Sat under a tree in the courtyard. Excellent salads - very fresh, straightforward & delicious. Good beer selection. Service was prompt & friendly."}
{"text":"Good fish & chips, good service and nice location. I was there at lunch with my work mates. Parking is a bit sparse in Old town, but that's true with any business there."}
{"text":"I decided to take my wife and friends out for dinner at Kelly's to try some place new. Unfortunately we were very disappointed with their service. When we had our appetizers delivered to our table, we had to wait roughly 15 minutes to receive plates and drink refills. When it came to our entrees they were mismatched and incorrect. We were also charged for their mistakes. E.g. Side of fries ordered, delivered salad. They charged us for the salad then said they would bring the fries at no charge. So we thought! They ended up charging us for both the salad and the side of fries and the side of fries were to be included for free with the entree. We were also charged for an additional dessert that we never ordered. We had asked to order some coffee after dinner and were told that they ran out of coffee around 11am this morning. Really!?! I would strongly advise against dining at Kelly's. It appears that it is more of an establishment for drinking than dining."}
{"text":"Came here randomly with drinks with friends. Good time, drink prices were ok if getting beer. Like the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Last year I had a great time at this bar....but after 10 Minutes on the phone with LAUREN I had a terrible experience! I was going over there and she wouldn't give me the time of day. They said they close on Tuesday at 11 and when I asked for advice she told me nothing and hung up on me!!!!!! Terrible service."}
{"text":"Comically poor service. 1:24 to get our meals (apps), and saw waitress 3 times for drinks.   Bring a good group of friends will be here for a very long time, and skip table service and go to the bar yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place, atmostphere and service on par. Jenna our server took great care of us and Joey made some great craft cocktails behind the bar. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I went last night. The food was really good and extremely reasonably priced! The server did mess up our order but the server and kitchen fixed it quickly and were extremely nice about it!! Couldn't ask for more! Went on a Sunday , they have happy hour all day Sunday, 4 dollars off appetizers and 4 dollar draft. I got filet mignon, boyfriend got a hamburger, got an appetizer, and two beers. Was only 60 dollars! Love it and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Beating Andrew Pentis is really fun at darts here. Yaya. Winning is fun. Great beers on tap. And the service is fast"}
{"text":"Food delivered after a looooooong wait, it was cold, and service was poor. Don't waste your money. We stopped by Sunday afternoon, no rush and no crowds present, so what was the service problem? No reason for it. Mixed greens salad with chicken...the chicken was dry and cold...seemed like it was pulled out of the refrigerator. We wanted to try the freshly made donut holes but after the long, long wait for our food, we asked the server how long they take. She said, \"Well, they take awhile.\" So we said no and road our bikes to The Sugar Bowl instead."}
{"text":"Ordered a Titos and soda... received a well vodka and soda which I paid way too much for. It was undrinkable. This place rips you off. So disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for happy hour. Drinks were not good. They didn't have much for taste and seemed to be watered down. The wait staff was very friendly and nice. However we were not impressed with the food or drinks. We enjoyed the patio with the cushion chairs. However, I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Service was OK, food was terrible. Wife and I were both starving, and I made the mistake of letting her choose this place because she liked the ambience.  Wife ordered chicken salad and Burger was awful had no flavor. I orders Mac n Cheese, and fish and chips. OK didn't expect the best fish & chips, but how can u screw up Mac N Cheese! The box from store has more flavor. Everything was bland, no spices or any flavor and chicken in the salad was not fresh and we couldn't taste any dressing. For the price!!! Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for happy hour and have to say I enjoyed it. The food was tasty (although I only had appetizers). I had the Moscow Mule and appreciated that it had just enough of a kick, feels like often drinks are too soft or too sweet and that wasn't the case here. We sat in a booth which had poor lighting, for someone who has to wear contacts or glasses I would have liked a bit more light."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour/early dinner, half priced bottles of wine and $5 bruschetta (among other eats/drinks) had the prosciutto/apple and Brie bruschetta as well as sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese,  both were very good I leaned towards the goat cheese which is so odd because I usually hate goat cheese, I think it was because they didn't load up the top with it.  The service that night was really on point, my water glass was never empty and continued even after the bill was paid and we were 2 minutes from leaving.  I had the 6th street chicken sandwich (grilled chicken breast, pepper jack cheese I think, jalapeños and guacamole.  My only complaint was that the chicken breast was paper thin and stringy.  The sandwich was good overall due to the other accompaniments.  Happy hour until 7 thumbs up great patio for when it's not 115 degrees out!"}
{"text":"Best HH ever! 1/2 off of any bottle of wine and include the jalapeño dip with house made chips.....awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't been here before. Yes, the bar is cool and the patio is nice (even though it was freakishly warm last Friday) but what really struck me was the people. I have a little pet peeve with the Scottsdale arena and sometimes I feel myself disliking the patron as some establishments due to the fact that Scottsdale can often be less than inviting and quite stuck up, not at this place. I really enjoyed the people here.   - I have lots of reasons to go back here, but one thing in particular must be to try their version of the already awesome Moscow Mule. I am not sure what's added or changed, but the house version is stated to be awesome and I will find this out for myself.   A negative is that they only have one little bathroom. That's unbelievable. And if the case would be that there are more bathrooms, then the negative is that I couldn't find them. An important thing when creating a comfortable drinking establishment, must be to make the act of relieving yourself and quick and easy ordeal - otherwise lots of valuable drinking time gets wasted in the pursue and wait of previously said relief.   - I will come back, and I will evaluate this establishment more thoroughly."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé came here for drinks. We were seated outside  and it wasn't too busy. We waited for over 25 minutes and  not a single wait staff came by. A couple who was seated 10 minutes after us was waited on and able to receive their drinks before we left. I would understand  if it was super busy but it wasn't and I noticed the waiters stopped by every other table while we were there with the exception of ours. After 25 minutes of waiting for not even someone to come by we were done with this place. The one good thing -- the hostesses were very polite."}
{"text":"Overall, nice bar/restaurant with nice ambiance.  Looking forward to spending a little more time here for dinner or drinks.  Updated review to come then..."}
{"text":"Service is great and the booze is flowing I have been here many times with both my boyfriend and other friends many times i enjoy happy hour here love ro come with the girls  Fantastic martini's and i love the roasted fingerling potatoes Got to love a nice martini  Due note that fridays are packed here come early or purch at the bar great place to get reaquanted with people."}
{"text":"Great service and staff. Food was just ok.  Great atmosphere and reasonably priced!  Check this place out!  All ages and very nice patios!"}
{"text":"I met a group of friends here last night, and it was my first time in. I liked the feel of the place, but it was wayyy too loud to enjoy conversation. Our waitress seemed like she really didn't want to be there. Service was slow and borderline unfriendly. Filet was overcooked. The kitchen remade it as ordered (medium rare) but it had no flavor. The price was decent. Not the worst dining experience, but it didn't inspire any plans to return."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a nice atmosphere.  However, the music is so loud.  Why does the music have to be so loud?  You go out to converse with your friends and family.  Not to get a headache and sore throat from screaming.  And the service....Oh my, horrific!! They have a lot of workers, but who knows what they are doing, because they are not waiting on you.  If you are in a hurry or want to talk with your friends, this place is not for you!  And it's sad because the food is good."}
{"text":"I was here and liked the place a lot. Food, ambience, service.. all seemed good. Although my friend didn't like her cold coffee much... but overall it is a nice place with good crowd. Will return."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their signature cocktail- Arizona Mule; it comes in a silver mug if you promise not to steal it Ha!  The bartenders were pleasant and gave good suggestions too; they really seemed to know the menu.  The food was pretty good and way above average compared to typical bar fare.  I had the Gas Lamp Chicken Sandwich and loved the grilled zucchini that came on it!  The fries were gobbled up by my friends.  It did however take forever to get my food and it was not that busy, but I think I need to come back again and maybe things will go a bit smoother.  The crowd was pretty eclectic, but definitely erred on the younger side.  I am sure I will be back again."}
{"text":"Oh, Kelly's, I want to continue loving you but it's growing increasingly difficult to incur your predictably snooty bartenders and my friends will no longer indulge my desire to keep giving you more tries... Oh, I hate it when a promising relationship becomes a deep disappointment...(sigh)."}
{"text":"5 words: Haloumi Stuffed Cherry Peppers! Not something I'd typically order but they were reccommended by our server and so we went with it. These little gems are life changing. Tangy, sweet cherry peppers encase a nugget of salty, slightly chewy cheese topped off with a zippy sweet balsamic glaze. Flavors and textures meld beautifully and I'm a believer!   The calamari was terrific too. Not breaded but instead tempura battered with a light crispy crunch. The squid was tender and not not chewy and the spicy aioli was a perfect dip!   The gas lamp chicken sandwich was also a masterpiece combining those same tangy cherry peppers in a crunchy slaw that gave this sandwich a little something special. The crusty roll was grilled and the chicken was moist, tender and juicy. I will definitely order this again! Get it with the mixed green salad, chock full of strawberries, hazelnuts and lucious goat cheese and finished with a delectable honey balsamic vinaigrette. Thank me later.  And don't miss the donut holes as a sweet finish to a Devine meal. Piping hot, fluffy dough balls covered in cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey. Shut the front door! These were positively sinful and the cup of hand whipped vanilla whipped cream should be on the menu as a dessert all it's own!   The service was fantastic from the bubbly hostess to the attentive, friendly server. Our sodas and waters were kept full to the top and plates cleared promptly and our food brought piping hot and quickly!   And the place is gorgeous inside! Masculine elegance softened up with fresh colorful tulips in mason jars on every table. The joint emitted warmth and friendliness, so unlike many other Scottsdale gastro-pubs!   This was a lunch excursion with my bestie and our babies and we felt comfortable and welcome. I can't wait to bring my husband for a perfect date!  Stop reading this and head over to Kelly's at Southbridge. Now."}
{"text":"Love love love Kelly's!   I just discovered this spot while I was doing The Taste of Scottsdale tour.  We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an \"award winning\" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent!   I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!    I can't wait to go back to Kelly's!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour scam alert again. The bruchetta deal is a blatant ripoff. It was 5 bucks, but the portion was half as big as normal and even that portion was a joke. The menu said mozzarella cheese, but the chef chose to cut a sliver of cheese on top of each 1/8th inch slice. See photos. We were only one of about six folks in the place and they at least could have improved on that appetizer choice. The Guiness was about four bucks, so at least that was a good deal."}
{"text":"New place in Old Town Scottsdale and so far, not like other bar/restaurants in Old Town --IN A GOOD WAY. Cool crowd.  The decor is very retro-chic.  I love the little top hat lights over the pool table.  They have private party rooms to reserve so it's a good place to plan an event.  The outside deck is amazing.  One of the more spacious I have seen.  The best part is the FOOD!  They have brussel sprouts on the menu that will make you reconsider everything you thought of brussel sprouts.  The chef came from a famous restaurant in Phoenix (I can't think of which one --I know they told me!).  So he is top notch. Even the mac & cheese was unique enough for mention.  Had the flat iron steak sandwich--very flavorful.  My husband loved the chickpea frites.  I thought they were OK--they tasted like a funnel cake without the powdered sugar to me.  Otherwise, the drinks were good, the crowd was fun and the place was special.  I am not your typical Old Town Scottsdale person (married with 3 kids!) but when we do make it out there--we will go to Kelly's again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Our sandwiches were good, but the service was dreadful.  There was one poor waitress handling the whole joint.  Lotsa cougar wannabes in the crowd for late lunch on a Sunday."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour with a dog friendly patio. I had the Arizona Moscow Mule - crisp, refreshing and such good flavor balance. We enjoyed the Rock Shrimp Ceviche and the bruschetta with Fuji Apple and prosciutto. Both good portions and very tasty. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice, and tasteful dishes i love it. I ordered the roasted chicken and it was really special. My friend ordered the steak and it looked so good!! I will definitely try it next time. My other friend ordered a salad and it was great! No lettuce in it so they don't go cheap on their ingredients!! It is a bit expensive but i would say it's totally worth the money."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a crowd older than 30 in Old Towns this is your place.  It's a bit more sophisticated than most bars in old town with less of a \"meat head\" feel.  The women definitely had more clothes on than you would normally see in a bar in Old Town. =)  I would say more of a NYC feel to it.  Also for anyone in their 30's/40's this will be more your scene.  I got the feeling the people who frequented this bar actually had real jobs and worked in respectable businesses.     I am going to have to disagree with a previous review stating their Moscow Mule was good.  The cup it came in was cheap and didn't keep the drink cold like its intended purpose, but above all else it didn't taste good either. If you want a real Moscow Mule go to T. Cooks at the Royal Palms.  I only had drinks at the bar so I can't talk about food.  To sum it all up, if you are looking for more classy and less trashy this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"In between 3 and 4 stars. Definitely a chill place to grab a drink, maybe some food, and play some pool. More young professional vibe and relaxed compared to the Old Town club scene down the road. Minus stars for slightly pretentious atmosphere, just okay service, and drinks that are good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Delicious burger, cooked to perfection.  The house made fries were very good.  My daughter had the smoked salmon sandwhich.  She raved about it.  It was such a beautiful looking sandwhich she took a picture of it.  The server was friendly and informative about the menu.  Great food for a very fair price."}
{"text":"This was also part of our recent culinary tour.  We were served a combo of their desserts - doughnuts and their version of a twinkie.  Fabulous!  Drinks were a plus too.  They manager was extremely friendly to our group.  Definitely a good waterin' hole!"}
{"text":"Already been here twice and am definitely going back again. It's got a nice vibe and atmosphere. The interior as well as exterior are superbly designed - very tasteful. Outside, are Christmas lights and a tree in the middle of the outdoor patio which is all very beautiful. Inside are different sections you can sit in, if you want to be secluded you can, if you want a couch in the back you got it, if you want to play putt-putt (south east of the building) you can, if you want to sit in a separate patio (the smaller one at the east side of the building) you can. There's just an overload of options, which is fantastic. So this is basically a bar and lounge overall, not for dancing, just fyi."}
{"text":"Got the chicken sandwich and added a salad it was surberb! This is my 2nd time here from NC and I look forward to coming here every time I'm in town. Outside seating is the best!!"}
{"text":"Once a month I go through this awesome experience: \"Let's go to old town\"  Me: Ahhh fucking Christ [anxiety starts kicking in as I picture crowds of douche bags, annoying people everywhere, struggles with cabs, girls attempting to walk in heels that look like they are fucking handicapped, and a guaranteed $100 if not $200 spend], where are we going?\"  \"Let's go to Kelly's\"  Me: \"FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK\"  The only word to describe this bar is: bland.  They have a solid piece of real estate, and a nice little setup, but apart from that this place blows.  Drinks? Overpriced Service? Slow Food? Shitty Crowds? YES  Why the fuck do people come here?  Kelly's is packed with a bunch of people who don't really know or like each other, people who aren't really good friends.  Friends have stuff in common, so they can agree on a certain bar. No one wants to go to Kelly's, it's just the only place left to go when you and a group of 8 idiots can't agree on a place.  Don't believe me? Read all the reviews on here and see how many of them say: \"Me and 26 of my *closest* friends decided to meet here\" or something to that effect.  Newsflash: You shouldn't be in a fucking group that big, that's why this place is packed.  Girls night groups of 10 wander around waiting to get molested while even more single dudes pretending to be respectable huddle around with their dicks in their hands.  Go here on a Sunday afternoon. I've done it, and it was decent. You'll have the place to yourself and everything I've said above won't really apply, except for this shit prices of course.  However, if it's a weekend (let's face it: it is) you'll get more bang for your buck standing in line at a port-a-potty than standing in a line to get into this joke."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I went for lunch with a group and we were literally the only people there. There were 12 of us and our food took a long time to come out. I got the mac n' cheese and wasn't very impressed compared to what I paid for it. Nothing special and kind of over priced.  The staff was very friendly though, I'll give them that. I would go one more time at night to check out the bar scene there and give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Late lunch ! Happy hour all day Sundays! Had our usual Ceviche! Yum and I had their short ribs in polenta! Yum and the hubby had a steak sandwich. He liked. Upscale pub, sports bar with great food!! Keeps us coming back!! Service is great too"}
{"text":"My server was \"Stephanie\" and she was great. She severed me a delicious happy hour flat bread and a few cockatails. She was incredibly accommodating. I was slightly confused about the new happy hour. But the manager accommodated me (short guy with a beard.) Without a doubt I will be back. Definitely a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Ambiance is more mix of high end meets millennials  The bar was in reachable but thankfully Jacklyn our host was extremely accommodating. I really appreciated the way she was able to swiftly and patiently able to multitask between an entire birthday party plus the general pop  If you're looking to feel VIP without the obligation of a minimum purchase or supplying attractive females just to get in.. Go HERE!  Wait in line, it's simply for ID check. Scottsdale consumers: don't feel entitled. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time at Kelly's Happy Hour this evening. The food was very tasty especially the jalapeño cheese dip w/ chips & pork wings(sorry no picture)! The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is due to the service. My table had to wait well over 20 minutes before being asked if we wanted any appetizers. Also, I can't forget to mention we always had to flag down the waitress for service since she hardly came by to see how the party of 5+ was doing.   Overall, I'll definitely be coming back to Kelly's for some delicious food and great HH prices."}
{"text":"According to a local insider, one of the least \"Dirty Scottsdale\" venues available for a cocktail. Which is really saying something about the rest of Scottsdale because I couldn't keep my eyes on the people (or my focus on the conversation going on) at my own table due to the variety of distractions at all the other tables. It's a nice place to sit outside (thanks for the misting spray) and I appreciate that they have Kim Crawford wine by the glass. Music is fine-to-good--a little clubbier than you might imagine given the looks of the place."}
{"text":"This was my second visit, but my first time trying the food. Great happy hour deal with half off starters. We tried several and they were all delicious. Especially the short rib tacos. We were here for a birthday and used a back room to gather. Lots of fun. Nice atmosphere. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice place, love the AZ Mule.  Manager Tim is great.  I miss Steve, he made really terrific drinks."}
{"text":"WOWZA! Such an amazingly great surprise to find this place. We were walking around the Sunday Farmers market on the canal and tried this place when we got hungry. There is this great Happy Hour all day Sunday you have to try. We enjoyed the tacos, fingerling potatoes, pork wings with spicy slaw, procuitto brusetta. EVERYTHING was so tasty."}
{"text":"The place is nice, the ambiance, not so sure, very Scottsdale I guess.  The appetizers that were ordered for the table, didn't look so great, so I skipped it, not worth the calories if it is not delicious.  My hubby's margarita was horrible, they had to do it over three times. I had a glass of bubbly.  It is so obnoxious of the smokers to stand next to you in the patio making you smell their grossness.  I have sinus issues and it is a hassle, I had to move to the other side of the table so I could breath, because the douchebags couldn't move closer to the edge of the patio.  I guess they can keep sucking on their cancer stick since I am not rushing back to Kelly's any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Sat on the patio with my buddies, live music was great and the setting was perfect. Cierra was our server and was delightful. Would recommend this place to any friend of mine visiting the area."}
{"text":"We were here Friday night. They literally have like 8 bartenders behind the bar and they still can't manage to acknowledge you and make you a drink in a timely manner. My sister is a bartender at a busy establishment in downtown Phoenix and she can handle the whole entire bar on a busy packed night, solo! And it wasn't even that busy. Pay attention to your customers Kelly's bartenders and tone down the cocky attitudes . The resting bitch face look suits your staff well."}
{"text":"I finally experienced this place in a sober enough state to feel just thoroughly confused. I kind of felt like I was in the middle of a match.com event or something.. a bunch of people awkwardly over dressed trying so very hard to impress one another. drinking out of tin cans. overpriced drinks. out of tin cans. I'm being kind of unforgiving, and judgmental, and exaggerating, but I cant help it.   ending on a positive note, the decor in here is pretty cool. spooky like - almost a mix of Kazimierz and 5th and Wine.. I wanna say? It's cozy, and maybe if not full of Idiots, I'd return (sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry)."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended by the locals.  Nestled in old town.  Highlights: Huge outdoor patio with dim lighting, lots of space for people to mingle.   Comfy seating that makes you want to lounge around while chatting with friends.  Creative cocktails like the pumpkin martini.   Moscow mule served proper, in a tin cup to keep it freezing cold.  They have good happy hour specials like 1/2 price wine bottles and girls night out.  We had a good time playing drinking games and catching up.  Maybe next time, we'll have more than just drinks."}
{"text":"Terrible place.  Ross in a suit is particularly unappreciative of clientele.   We Ordered many drinks but he wouldn't even let me finish my beer.  He literally took my beer out of my hand and told me to leave with a hundred dollar tab.  Please do not give this place your business."}
{"text":"This rating of a 5 is a surprise to me.  we just were hungry after the River Walk Festival.  we, saw a patio full of people in a place that had a,sign stating they had the best burger in town. well we did not order the burger.  Fish and Chips to die for and I had tacos and bruschetta. Sound ordinary.  Anything but.  Beautiful presentation. Great service.  Extraordinary taste.  We will be there again."}
{"text":"Found a HIDDEN GEM in the heart of Downtown Scottsdale / Camelback Area! Right on the corner of 6th & Stetson Dr. is a delightful, welcoming 'CHEERS' type bar & restaurant!  Friendly place on a Saturday night ! (6pm) Greeted & seated right away in a BIG comfy booth with a big window overlooking their nice outdoor patio area.  The attentive waiter came right away & told us about the specials. We decided on their AWARD-winning Burger and Chicken sandwich, however.  They were both DELICIOUS & prepared/ seasoned just right. Mine came with sautéed vegetables & burger came with tasty seasoned fries. Great service, GREAT food in a warm, friendly atmosphere will keep us coming back! My only TIP.. We'd love to see reasonably priced ($5-6) \"Appetizers\" or Happy Hour specials like Spiced Meatballs, (Which were served at Anniversary event)  Mini-Sliders or Tasty Brushetta Bread with Tomatoes & Aioli toppings... ?"}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Friday night with my friends and were seated immediately. We were in the mood for bruschetta but had been told that they ran out of all of their bruschettas which was odd. So I settled for the short rib tacos. Unfortunately, they were bland. The roasted fingerling potatoes were soggy and not good at all. The bbq braised short rib sandwich was okay but nothing special. The fries were decent and I could taste the truffle oil. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"***Only here for happy hour*** first time here tonight was for happy hour. Pretty good atmosphere, drinks were good. Service was friendly. Some of the people in our group had food, which looked good. I'd come here again for some drinks before dinner or to meet up with coworkers. Next time I'll eat!"}
{"text":"Love this place...everything from appetizers to entrees were great. I also LOVE the outdoor patio seating :)"}
{"text":"Very cool, laid back bar in Old Town Scottsdale!  We showed up at happy hour and enjoyed the 1/2 price cocktails...the strawberry shamrock was AMAZING!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My tab was $15.65. The suggested 20% tip was $5.80. Actual 20% is $3.13. I'm a local and will never return or suggest this place again."}
{"text":"I lefty dinner at some other place. I was visiting so I ended up at the nearest place when my phone was about to die. It was Ok. Very touristy. I called an uber and was about to go home when I went outside and was enamored by the lights. Then I heard the live music. I started following the sweet sounds and found exactly what I was looking for. Cool people old and young relaxing, enjoying good music and good company. Imagine being on a quiet street with lights strung from the trees, a fig playing the guitar, a woman with a beautiful voice and sipping a pear infused marinti. On a Monday. This place is pretty great. And Melissa! My waitress! Was awesome. She recommended my drink and was just genuinely sweet."}
{"text":"A different atmosphere depending on when you go.  Awesome lunch specials and great food.  Go friday or saturday night for a jumping crowd full of scottsdale's A group.  Sometimes gets crowded but so does every other decent place in scottsdale.  Had the blue burger last time which came out perfect."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but Kelly's seems to be going in a different direction. Menu has changed along with the prices and the happy hour is smaller. But hey, the Service is 5 Star."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a few nights ago.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  This place is most definitely more a bar than a restaurant and probably gets packed at night.  Kelly's seems like a nice spot to relax and have a few drinks.  The decor is interesting with lots of comfy looking couches on which to socialize.  Anyway, to the food...     To start we ordered a round of drinks.  The happy hour specials are pretty decent but the $8 martini ($16 regular price) had an extremely weak pour.  Barely even worth the 8 bucks.  The wings were just ok but the mac n' cheese was pretty tasteless.  For an entree I ordered the burger which was very good.  Perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  I wasn't sure what to think of the side condiments that came with though (some kind of peppers and another mushy spread thing).  The fries were also very good and seemed to be freshly made and not frozen.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her chicken breast sandwich.  I had a bite as well and it was very good.  The aioli makes it I think.  Our waiter/server was very good.  He was courteous, friendly, and didn't take too long with my diet coke refills.  In summary, this place is a bar with above-average bar food.  I probably won't be back, but not because it wasn't good.  It was good but just not that special.  Pro Tip:  get the half price certificate at Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) because it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!!!  A group of us here for a bachelorette party decide to go to Kelly's because locals said it was good. Let's start with us getting to the door and they say no tables open to accommodate us, as we are walking away I notice numerous tables. We walk back and tell her about the tables and her reply \"oh \" and takes us in.  Inside our waitress has severe memory loss as she forgets our food and blames it on the chef. Forgets drinks and we have to ask numerous times .   The food is just shy of average. Nothing special. Nice cold potatoes. Meatballs that tasted like they come from Costco.   Here is the best part about this dumpster. A older gentleman approaches our table to talk with some of the girls. He buys the bachlorette a drink and proceeds to chat with us. All of us girls cash out our tabs. The waitress tell us she can't find this gentleman and that we have to pay his tab. What!! She stated since he was by us we are responsible. What kind of business is this? Teach the waitress to take a credit card from the drunk mess old man before trusting him. This place is a joke. We actually had to pay the tab for this douche bag because the place wouldn't lets us go without paying or they said they would call the police."}
{"text":"First time at Kelly's and was greeted by a Nordic Swedish goddess behind the bar who I asked to surprise me with her favorite specialty cocktails. They were superb!! I also ordered the mozzarella bruschetta and the ceviche, pleasantly surprised with the ceviche that came with dragonfruit and sliced mango. To top it off, I was able to confirm the validity of a prior post. The douche bag score would be a 4 at the moment."}
{"text":"We always have the best time here. The food and drinks are great and the service is fantastic. They have a friendly staff and have always been able to accommodate us no matter the size of the group. Great for a casual night out or a large group party. They also have several great patios to enjoy a dinner or drink outside."}
{"text":"Was in town this week on vacation and was recommended to Kelly's by my sis and brother in law. It was amazing!!!!!! I believe our server was Jenna and she was outstanding. Very knowledgeable about their menu and what was offered!!!! I can't wait to come back to The AZ area and come back!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Kelly's quite a bit since I moved back. I like this place. The vibe is different than club row down the street. The mix of people and overall ambience is different which I like. The outside patio is fun and refreshing to step outside if it gets too crowded.  The staff is nice and not pretentious or thinking they are better than you. I get service with a smile and sometimes a good conversation. I have also been here during the day for networking and the space is big enough to hold large crowds. I had food and it was tasty. They had salads and tacos with their own spin on it.   The DJs they hire I personally like because they play good music to dance to and keeps the crowd engaged.   I need to try more of the food and go earlier but the drinks and night life is fun and I enjoy going. It's alway away from the other nonsense which helps with less crazies at night.   I'm 100 at Kelly's. That is an inside joke between friends, but it's true."}
{"text":"We visited Kelly's right after work for dinner, and were hungry to eat. The ambience is nice, and the seats and large and comfy. The service was prompt, and food and drinks were good overall. I ordered the Moscow Mule, and the E 6th Ave Chicken Sandwich with onion strings on the side, my colleagues ordered a variety of stuff including the Southbridge chicken sandwich, the fish and chips, and the steak, along with the cheese curds for appetizers. All of them were content with the quality of the food and drinks. Drinks are definitely overpriced here though, the Moscow Mule definitely did not look like it was worth $12, especially when you don't serve it in a copper mug, which was disappointing. Otherwise, it was a good place for a Friday evening dinner in the happening area of Scottsdale Old Town."}
{"text":"Much of old town is the same, dark room music lame drinks and 30k millionairess douche`s. I f you can not tell I am so over that scene. However Kellys breaks the mold. It has a nice patio and real cocktails that make use of some unique components.   I was a bit disappointed that my drink came in a glass rather than the copper mug listed on the menu but the Moscow mule was tasty and at $13 it should be.  Music outside was audible but not too loud and the lighting was decent."}
{"text":"Meh.... I don't really care for the vibe. It's kinda like an upscale dive bar. It's bland and full of bland people. The food is pretty good and that's why I'm giving it a little credit."}
{"text":"Got carded at the front door like normal...... then the bartender (female blonde) decided to card me at the bar right after I got checked at the front (I was completely sober) she said it was a policy but I've been there plenty of times before and it has never happened. I won't be going back cause of this bartender."}
{"text":"Comfortable, dark, non-pretentious. This is very hard to find in Scottsdale. Happy hour specials are great! (1/2 off cocktails, $2 off draft and $1 off bottle beers). Our server was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The music overhead was my cup of tea: The Black Keys and The White Stripes and other blues and rock classics. Everyone that walked into this bar was in casual dress. They have a pool table and ample seating. Got there around 4:30pm and had an entire 2 couches to ourselves (just the 2 of us). The mac'n cheese was very tasty, with a special addition on top (spicy hot cheetos!). We also ordered the bread pudding, which took a while to come out, but was voluntarily taken off our bill by the nice manager. It was quite delicious and rich. We spent a good 2 hours here at least escaping the heat of the day."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go! Great out door patio to hang out it or watch the game inside. The food is fantastic as well.Beacon Brussel sprouts and the burger are my go-too! Dan, your the man!"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks! I'm not sure how long this spot has been here, as I never saw it. The food looked really good and I look back to trying Kelly's prior to eating dinner. We came as an early evening, post-dinner spot to hangout. The crowd was fairly thick for a week night, but we had a good time.  The patio seems like a wonderful place for an event. The ambiance is quiet and peaceful.  This is way better than YardHouse for a late night spot to connect."}
{"text":"Have been here for happy hour a number of times -- the Pom margarita and Peartini were recent favorites.  Both not overly sweet and with a nice tartness that was refreshing after walking Old Town for a couple of hours.  Happy Hour food options include half off bruschetta (goat cheese with sundried tomatoes was very fresh and tasty), and $4 off starters."}
{"text":"Overall, Kelly's was a decent place to drink and socialize.  Saturday night around 9 and there was a line out the front door. Though we waited just a little, it was enough Scottsdaleness to be a slight turn-off. The atmosphere was very lively and the inside was packed. There are several back rooms and side bars that do make it easy to tuck yourself away from the main area fray. Once we perched at the bar, it was easy to order drinks and I really enjoyed myself. Their huge patio can get you some fresh air if you don't mind the smokers. Typical \"bar with patio\" problems.  One of the best parts about Kelly's is the location away from the Scottsdale club scene. It gives it a classiness that is difficult to find elsewhere and the clientele reflects that. I would like to come back and try their dinner/lunch selections and experience more of the patio from a seated position.  If you're looking for a good place to drink, check out Kelly's. If it's packed, you should probably go elsewhere. It's walking distance from many other places that are cheaper and not as busy... if all you're doing is drinking."}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual drink in old town. Love the patio and the big round bar.  Most bartenders pour weak drinks but overall great spot!"}
{"text":"Kelly's is definitely a new favorite for us. What a great happy hour- one of the best! A versatile place that hits the spot whether you're in the mood for a quick drink at the bar, an afternoon lunch on the patio with the girls, or a romantic dinner in the candlelight with your SO. The pool table and TVs are great for the sports enthusiast and if you're there late enough, they bring in a dj on Fridays and Saturdays to get the party started. They really covered every base at this spot for every person/every mood. Fantastic menu/food."}
{"text":"I am undecided between four and five stars so I went with five because overall this second very good experience exceeded my expectations.  We started our dinner with happy hour prices and got a pretty good bottle of wine half price for almost what it cost you at the store and those tasty Haloumi Cheese stuffed cherry peppers for only $4.00.  We went with burgers for dinner and I have to say my nearly perfect burger was the most delicious burger I ever had out and is deserving of a more fitting name like maybe Mary Poppins, Practically Perfect in Every way! I tried what they named the sweet chili Burger. This burger doesn't need cheese or bacon or even sauce to make it taste good. This burger was really different and creative with layers of flavors and the perfect bun to meat ratio. The roll was buttery fresh and lightly salted and never fell apart while eating the sandwich. The delicious patty is made of Short rib , sirloin , chuck and brisket and is also seasoned. Toppings were pickled fresno chiles ,onions , cucumbers and under the patty were greens. This combination was a flavor bomb! My only minor criticism is the patty seemed a bit dense and maybe the meat was packed too tight. The side I picked were the mixed vegetables and they were beautiful above average vegetables including broccolini and wax beans. I really enjoyed this burger.  My husband enjoyed the Kelly's Original Burger and had the tasty perfect onion straws with it.  I also purchased a Kelly's local dines dot com certificate and saved a good amount of the bill with that too.  That seems like an overall five stars to me."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped into Kelly's last night on our monthly date night without the kiddos.  We sat on the beautiful patio and happened upon their happy hour. The drinks were good and strong.  I ordered the Peartini and was afraid it would be too sweet but it was perfect.   We shared an assortment of starters.  All were delicious.  The stuffed cherry peppers were my favorite-what a unique and delicious blend of flavors!  The ceviche was nice and light, the popper dip was fantastic and the short ribs tacos were tasty.   The inside of Kelly's is very old school.  I liked it too but it was cold...I preferred sitting outside under the big tree on a perfect Scottsdale night! They have an award winning burger that we were too full to try but I can't wait to come back and try it! The location is perfect for strolling before or after dinner.  Our service was great. No complaints and looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I have come to Kelly's for years. But today was the first time I felt truly that my server was amazing. Molly, out server on the patio, was amazing and took care of us not just as customers but based on what she knew we needed and it was amazing. When You come in to Kelly's  ask for Molly, she helps provide an awesome experience."}
{"text":"About eleven of us were meeting up for a night out on the town and I decided we should meet at Kelly's since: a) I have never been there and wanted to check it out (IT'S ALL ABOUT ME!); and b)we wanted some food in our stomach in case we decided to drink a little (aka a lot).  The patio wasn't open yet, so we sat inside in a very large, but comfortable booth. The outside patio is very spacious with clear lights wrapping around trees and iron posts and with its own bar tucked nicely into the corner.The inside bar area look sophisticated, but casual, and the lighting throughout the restaurant bar was dim and for some reason I couldn't help but be reminded slightly of Mabel's on Main.  The food was pretty tasty and while the prices aren't ridiculously high, I think they are a little overpriced. My friend ordered the calamari ($9) that came with a delicious spicy aioli dipping sauce. I wasn't a fan of the tempura fried calamari itself. I  felt like there was too much tempura that you couldn't taste the calamari. I ordered the poached pear bruschetta ($9) that was layered thick with soft bleu cheese and topped with garlic shreds. It was okay, I don't think I would order it again. My other friend ordered the Shaft Bleu burger ($14) that came with fries. The burger was a normal size, I didn't taste that, but the fries were deliciously crisp and fresh tasting that some other friends, due to the sampling, order a side all by themselves.   Onto the drinks! Everyone was happy with their weapon of choice and we did not have any problems with drink preparation like some of the other Yelpers. Since Kelly's does not stock Hendrick's, I went for something different and chose their Strawberry Shamrock drink ($10). I quickly became addicted and highly recommend this beverage consisting of strawberry rum, cucumber vodka, muddled mint, sweet n sour, and soda water. My one friend tried the Moscow Mule (after handing over her ID for the server to keep so that she doesn't steal the copper mug that they serve it in - weird) and she also tried the Arizona Mule, which differs to the Moscow Mule due to the addition of grapefruit bitters and that it is served in a silver mug (but she didn't have to give her ID back to the server for that one). She recommends staying with the Moscow Mule.  The service was great, even with our large party. The bathrooms were clean, but small for the size of the restaurant. All in all, we would come back for drinks, but undecided about the food."}
{"text":"Our first time in Scottsdale and decided to cruise through old town Scottsdale. Wandered upon Kelly's and decided to sit in and try it out. Patio has a beautiful set up, lights and everything you can imagine how pretty it would be at night. Prices are decent and the quality of food is very good! I had the Bourbon Burger containing Pancetta, fried egg, onion ring, and bbq sauce with a delicious mix for their actual meat patty. My bf had their short rib tacos and we both enjoyed. We cruised through our visit having a cocktail to start and just listened to music on the patio and enjoyed the early afternoon air in November. I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch any day!"}
{"text":"Having lived out of the country for a few years, it's shocking to see how many bars and clubs have come and gone in Scottsdale and Tempe over the short course of 3 years. So at the suggestion of a friend working in the industry, I scheduled a meetup at Kelly's at the start of our night out on the town.  I can't even remember what used to be here before - but Kelly's is huge. Considering the size of most Old Town bars, Kelly's is like the Mall of America. Lots of difference areas the hang and chill indoors and out is really nice especially when the weather changes. And as big as it was, it did fill up quite quickly, which shows its popularity.  Drink prices seemed average and service was fast (earlier in the evening) but the waitresses that came around seemed to be pretty efficient. I have a group of 17 people spanning 2 tables on the patio, and everyone seemed really happy and having a good time. Next time I am back in town, if Kelly's is around (and by the looks of it I would assume so) I'll probably make it my group meetup again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and ended up staying all night! The ambiance, fantastic customer service, and an amazing food and beverage menu was all I needed to complete my night! We'll definitely be back! Thanks for a great night Kelly's!"}
{"text":"Great setting, comfy chairs. Took twenty minutes to be served. We had reserved a small part of the patio so one server was waiting on all of us. Unfortunately I spilt my first beer. Some how I managed to set my beer on an uneven surface, \"timber!!\" my shoe filled with beer. No big deal, we can clean it up, but....the waitress  looked at me, as if I had ran over her cat. It took about 3 more drinks for her to be remotely friendly, I guess a big tab is worth a smile.  I closed out after sitting and chatting for awhile, the bill was decent and I left a below average tip. Shit hit the fan. As I ordered an uber, the manager came to ask what was wrong. After speaking with him, the waitress came and confronted me while I was trying to leave. Thanks to her I met the big security guard who walked me to my uber. Just turned into an unpleasant experience.  One I will always remember, but never recommend."}
{"text":"Dinner was great last night! Good food, amazing service. We stayed after dinner for a few cocktails and the AWESOME dj. Great spot."}
{"text":"Kelly's is probably the only cool Irish pub that I know of in the old town area? I've had some cool times here ...   The crowd here is usually a bit older and less douchey than the majority of other old town bars ... The music is usually on point.  I've never tried the food here, but the bartenders are pretty solid ... Most of them actually know how to make a decent cocktail, which is a step up from the average old town bartender who doesn't even know how make a proper pour ;)     The drinks here are a bit pricier than some of the other spots, but as I said the bartenders here actually know how to make drinks like an old fashioned....  The last time I was here for a Bday party and we all hung out in one of the back rooms played darts, had a few drinks, and socialized ...  People are usually a bit more social here and not quite as snotty as some of the other spots in the area ... I would recommend trying Kelly's out for yourself because it's way more chill and low key, with less little kids running around who haven't learned how to handle their alcohol yet.  When it's nice out the best place to be is on the patio!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 10ish on a Friday night after a show and we were enticed in by the lovely gas lamps, the hot music and the delicious aromas. We were seated outside per our request and waited over 15 minutes for our server to show up-although her bus boy brought us water. When she finally showed up, we ordered our food and drinks right then, so we would not be left alone for another fifteen minutes. I had the gaslight chicken sandwich which was super dry-I wanted to ask for a side of italian dressing to dunk it in but our server proved that her inattention was more of a habit than a fluke. Also wanted salt and pepper, never saw that either.  Hubby had the   'famous\" bleu cheese  burger (four kinds of meat! whatever) and it was very tasty, as were the homemade chips.   Sit on the patio and enjoy the very hipster, beautiful and drunk patrons-drunk being the keyword here. Also creepy taxi drivers that also appeared intoxicated hanging around the front door. We will try it again, but earlier in the evening and I will avoid having Jaqueline as a (non) server."}
{"text":"Kelly's is a fresh addition to Old Town and feels like a bar out of San Francisco or Chicago. Those who visit Kelly's seem to be professionals in the mid-late 20's and 30's so it's not a bar where you'll see lots of people in college. The interior is warm with dark wooden panels and dim lightening. They have a good amount of indoor seating, they have a private room in the back, but the most seating lies on their spacious patio. Their patio is one of the best decks around and offers a great area to sit and enjoy some food and drinks when the weather's nice. I also really enjoyed their drinks which are made fresh with very fresh ingredients. During my recent visit, I ordered a chicken sandwich and french fries. The food is several steps above your typical bar food and offers a nice flavor. All in all, I am a big fan of Kelly's and I think this is a perfect lounge to frequent. However, I personally liked it the most in the early evening. It was one in one out by 10 PM!"}
{"text":"Last night we visited Kelly's for the first time. What a great little gem! I use \"little\" loosely as it's actually is 7500sq ft! It has a huge patio, a few private rooms and a great big bar! We loved the couches they have throughout the inside and outside. Some of the people we were with ordered food and had the chickpea fries. I thought they were very flavorful and the sauce that came with them was super yummy too. I know we will be back very, very soon for more food (and more cocktails). I also saw they have some different type of cocktails that I will for sure try soon. If you are in the area I would certainly suggest giving Kelly's a try. You will definitely not be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"Alight Nightlife Spot, Some Good, Some Bad...  We arrive, the 8 of us to hang out and spend the night floating around eating, talking and doing the nightlife routine...   The Good: The female bartender in the patio little bar area was super friendly and great. She had a good attitude and even helped some of the girls with drink suggestions which they liked.   The Bad: The female bartender in the main bar area cannot mix drinks at all, and couldn't even make Long Island iced teas... She had no service skills and seemed angry with life in general... We avoided the main bar after 3 rounds of her dismay even after tips...   Music was decent, atmosphere is really cool. It seems like a good spot to try to have dinner another time.   The outdoor patio has some good furniture to hang out with your friends on."}
{"text":"Setting with bar, tv, patio is ok but almost empty at 8:00pm. Extremely loud music that didn't seem to pull in crowd. Worst fish & chips ever had. Brussel sprouts just ok. Waitress & other attendants were good but not exactly friendly."}
{"text":"Love their prime rib tacos, cheese curds, stuffed heirloom cherry tomatoes & Brussel sprouts. Their outside patio is nice but it's getting chilly out & no heat lamps are available just yet. The service is always good. They have a good selection of signature cocktails & beers. Still no FireBall  Always a good spot to have a group of friends meet up at. Oh & they have pool & darts for the competitive people."}
{"text":"Kelly's is my favorite bar in OldTown. Every time my friends and I go out in OldTown- Kelly's is a must! I just love the ambiance and the decor. The outside tree with the lights on it is so fun! The bartenders and managers are all great too. If you want to have a great night at an upscale bar- Kelly's is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Came here for an college alumni watch party. My husband and I both tried the 4 square burger and they were delicious. The truffle fries were some of the best I've had. Would definitely come back. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Hip spot with the indoor/outdoor old town appeal. Food has always been good & it's a perfect weekend night hot spot that won't bring the craziness that the clubs on Saddlebag Trail do. Dress code? ...Dressier than casual but not formal"}
{"text":"Great Sunday spot to hang with family and or friends.  We had incredible food and drinks, don't miss out on the pretzel.  The patio has such a great layout with couches and TVs."}
{"text":"I just visited Kelly's  yesterday and to say that I was impressed is an understatement!  The place is very eclectic and would appeal to a broad range of clientele.  Definitely an adult themed restaurant, so please keep the kids at home.  The outdoor setting is the largest and perhaps the best in the area.  I am looking forward to having my birthday party there in November!"}
{"text":"I love the good sized patio and the gas lamps add a nice classy touch. I would come back just to sit on the patio sipping drinks and observing a local species known as the Douchebagus Scottsdaleus in its natural habitat. The Douchebagus is a nocturnal creature that  typically travels in packs of three to eight and flourishes in the area engaging in a complex mating ritual that includes consuming copious amounts of alcohol and behaving in an increasingly obnoxious and self-absorbed manner until it attracts an equally obnoxious and self-absorbed mate.  The patio at Kelly's offers front row seating as packs of Douchebagi roam the streets, though this does detract from the classy touched afforded by the gas lamps.  Beyond the front row entertainment, I was happy with the bruschetta and cheese plate and the Jameson girls were there so I enjoyed more than a few Jamey and Gingers (Jameson and Ginger Ale) on special for $4. For dessert I had a greyhound so the amateur-professional alcoholic in me could not have been happier.  Laura was not thrilled about her steak sandwich and made it a mission not to let me order food (did I eat at all that night? I really can't remember) and some of the other people in our group repeatedly had to send back their drinks. The margarita \"tasted like lime juice\" if I recall. But I continued to happily down my Jamey and Gingers. So much that we eventually decided to move on.  I think we did the right thing by starting here then moving on to drunker pastures."}
{"text":"Myself and two friends went here last Saturday to check out this spot. We had planned to come here for my birthday in June with a huge group of people. We started on the back patio, because there were no seats in the front and we are smokers. No complaints the back patio is private and the waitress we had was attentive and awesome. We moved up front so we could people watch and that's when the experience turned sour. I have nothing poor to say about the food. It was great. Bruschetta was great, I had chicken parmesan and despite the chicken being a tad bit burnt and the pasta not all the way cooked it was good. my friends had a burger, and meat balls and they loved it. The problem was the service. the hostesses and waitresses all huddle at the front and hang out, super unprofessional. We asked one waitress to please get our server so we could order more drinks before happy hour was over (she hadn't checked on us in about 20 minutes), and she looked at us like we were crazy. And then was super rude about getting our waitress, instead of just politely taking our order and giving that tab to our waitress. After the experience we said no way to coming here for my birthday, the service just wasn't worth the atmosphere or food. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Old Town. Great live music, comfortable couches, great happy hours (all day on Sunday!). I recommend the XoXo Martini and Tuna tartare. The apple bruschetta is excellent too."}
{"text":"Kelly's just opened up this week and is off to a good start.  They have a great corner location with one of the best front patios in Scottsdale.  I've had drinks at the bar and on the patio and loved both visits.  Nice menu, good drinks and super friendly service."}
{"text":"1st time here but a great burger, decor and outdoor seating.  Fun place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come all the time but please PUT SOME PURSE HOOKS IN THE LADIES BATHROOM!!! I do not want to set my purse in the floor or the back of the toilet."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and like the vibe overall. I find that Kelly's is spacious, has friendly staff and delicious cocktails! This is a different kind of bar then most in Old Town and find myself drawn here for those reasons. I enjoy the dim lights, wood interior and current holiday decorations. I have not tried the food but hope to soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The first couple weeks, yes it was a while ago, were amazing. Since then the service has declined. A friend had a broken glass and they poured the beer from a broken glass in to a new glass. What?!?!  Well tonight.... Showed up with 5 people. Yes they were busy. But the bartenders definitely played favorites. Passed us a couple time. Then went 'in order' and passes us a couple more times. Even went to the opposite side of the bar for friends. He told us we were next a couple times. Sad. Obviously they don't care business wise because they were busy. But ridiculous that a bar is ok running this way."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and outdoor patio atmosphere with live music. We loved our server, Kera!"}
{"text":"Great experience here as our first time and in town from Maryland for vacation. MUST try the pork wings, they are amazing and you will not be disappointed. Also had the jalapeño popper dip which was very good as well."}
{"text":"I only drank here, but found it to be nice, with fair prices and a good crowd. I'd go back..."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Kelly's. On one hand, their evening offerings seem to be good. Drinks and late night noms are good, but when I went here for lunch, it was awful.   My soda was flat, short rib tacos were dry and tasteless, and the bruschetta was weird and had a stringent, bitter taste...too much truffle oil?  However, service has always been good and their mules, Arizona or Moscow, are delicious. Also, their decor is really cute. I love the leather couches and the booths."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, bad bad service. I was here for a college football game and had a bartender swear at me under his breath for sitting at the bar too long. It's a football game! He also gave me attitude when he messed up my check. I might go back but if this guy is there again I'll turn around and walk out."}
{"text":"I was here for a quick drink with friends. It was a packed house on a Saturday night at the bar. We grabbed a table near the entrance and were pretty much in and out so I didn't get a full on experience. Seems like a fun place to go. Lots of people, good energy, cozy seating for reserved parties with couches and classy decor.   I only had a vodka soda so I can't really comment on any specialty drinks or food, but the service was pretty good and I'll try it out again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Kelly's at SouthBridge is my favorite happy hour spot in Old Town Scottsdale! With so many great appetizers all half-priced from 3-7p, you can't go wrong.   I'm a bit overdue in writing this review, but I still have fond memories of the fun evenings and happy hours spent here and couldn't keep this to myself any longer.   One of the great things about Kelly's is that they have happy hour EVERYDAY! Monday to Saturday from 3-7pm and ALL DAY Sunday you can enjoy 50% off appetizers, $4 drafts/wine/well drinks, and $4 off signature cocktails.   The appetizers at Kelly's are delicious and the happy hour menu offers a number of great drink options!   Our favorite appetizers are the Haloumi Stuffed Cherry Peppers ($4, HH) and Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($5, HH). These are so good we ordered them every time we came! Definitely recommend trying these two dishes, especially at the happy hour price you can't go wrong!   For heartier appetites, I recommend the Short Rib Tacos - very tasty and great value at $6 during HH! And of course, Kelly's Original Four-Cut Burger ($14) is not to be missed for dinner. My friend raves about the perfect combination of short-rib, sirloin, chuck, and brisket, served with onion relish and Comté cheese. Try it and see what you've been missing!    The bartenders have a heavy hand - good news! Except if you like a sweeter drink (like me) take note! My Old Fashioned ($8, HH) was so strong I had to \"water it down\" with club soda. I'm such a wuss. I don't know why I'm complaining, but unless you can handle straight whiskey, I'd suggest skipping this drink and trying one of the other creative cocktails options!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend recently stopped for some food after going to the canal convergence.  The other nearby restaurants are much more expensive and had long waits.  This place had no wait, good food, and the price was reasonable for the area.  My only complaint is my girlfriend ordered a burger well done, because she is pregnant and cant eat raw meat.  She told the server this and she said she told the cook, but when we got our burgers hers was bloody red.  Ironically mine was well done.  I have to give them credit, though.  When we told them of the mistake they gave us a new burger and the manager talked to my girlfriend to make sure it was ok.  So even though it wasnt a perfect experience, i'll give them an overall good rating.  I would definitely consider going here again in the future."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is great! Great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food. What more can you ask for? My boyfriend and I sat on the patio which is spacious and comfortable. We ordered the bruschetta to start (you have to try the prosciutto it's delicious) & it came out in a timely manner. I had the short rib & my boyfriend had the chicken parmesan. The short rib was outstanding, I enjoyed the fact they serve it with a fried egg on top. The chicken parmesan came with a delicious sauce that compliments the chicken cutlet very well. The general manager, Kevin, as well as the assistant general manager, Erik, made sure we had a pleasurable dining experience. They were very professional and accommodating. If you're in the area I would highly recommend Kelly's!"}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed with the typical Scottsdale douchebag doorman who kept us outside in the freezing cold even though the bar was half empty.  Once we were finally inside, we had a great time.  We met our friends at the bar and enjoyed a great evening.  Good vibe inside and decent drinks.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ahh, Kelly's....one of our favorite watering holes in Old Town.  We love coming here for happy hour.  They just added Stone IPA on the Beer menu, which is one of my favorites.    We enjoy coming here because it's relatively big and comfortable.  There are large sofas and love seats sprawled through one section of the bar, so there's plenty of room to relax.  The bar top is very wide, so there's plenty of room for your drinks and food.  There's even an outdoor area when the weather is nice....something for everyone.  That's why we like to come here....very few complaints from our clients and colleagues when we choose to meet up here.  Will have to try the food one day.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Went last night for my dad's birthday. Our experience there was fine, but now my brother and I have food poisoning, likely from the Southbridge sandwich."}
{"text":"Oh Em Jeezus! Thank gawd for friends who have the skinny on awesome new places!  I went here for a friend-of-a-friend's birthday and I had no idea what to expect. I kept forgetting the name so didn't look it up like usual. I have to say, this place would firmly stand against the onslaught of my highest expectations, but since I had none it made the experience stellar!  The Arizona Mule, recommended by the server, was great. It came in a tin cup and you guested it, it was pricey. $12+  True to form I was drawn to the most unfamiliar and mysterious items on the menu: Compressed Watermelon and crispy feta (unfamiliar, not to mention gorgeous), and the Trilogy of Bruschetta (mysterious). Both were a welcome and sweet/savory revelation!  I need a raise so I can frequent this place, I totally recommend it for anytime you want to pamper your palette."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful location.  The tuna appetizer is fantastic and the four square burger is best in old town.  Great service and ambience make this place a must-try in old town."}
{"text":"Started with fingerling potatoes and Pear & Blue Cheese bruschetta. The potatoes were varied, colorful and very tasty. Nice sour cream & chive sauce which they bathed in. Great start ;)  We were seated outside at the patio, good ambience, intimate lighting and weather didn't hurt (75F) :)  The entrees were even better! Chicken Parm and Chicken/ Butternut Squash Ravioli. Chicken Parm had Gemelli pasta and white sauce. Really nice combo ;)  Wrapped it up with cinnamon donut holes and chocolate covered strawberries! Excellent, just excellent.   Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First time to Kelly's and I must say I'm impressed! I was a little sketchy when the group I was with said we were going to a unfamiliar Scottsdale bar. We got to the bar and it's amazing the decor and the set up of the bar is so comfortable and spacious! There's tons of room for everyone! They have a pool table and darts. There is different areas to sit which include couches and chairs. The music was a great mix! They have an outside area with bar, which had an amazing live band, comfortable seating, and heaters if it gets chilly. My drink was consistently good not too strong and not weak and I was able to easily always grab a drink not fighting to get to the bar. The crowd is a mix ranging from 30's to 60! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuummmmm. Heard about this place on Yelp and it was T&T! (Tried and true). Got some amazing appetizers, fig bruschetta, wings. Holy cow the wings were sooooo good. I got the filet for dinner with garlic mashed and green beans and it was one hundred. Great location right by the water in Scottsdale. Great for a date night and walk along the water. Right in the hub of all the great nightlife and bars!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here as the concluding stop on our food tour of old town Scottsdale with Destination Food tours. We were warmly greeted by the owner and given the grand tour of the place including the putting green, dart room, secret private back patio (perfect for small groups) and then settled in on these great wicker couches on the huge outdoor patio.  Because we were part of a tour, the owner brought out a bunch of free ginger beer & dark rum cocktails (yum!) on the house along with the scheduled dessert course (cinnamon donut holes and a yummy red velvet and marshmallow cake).  It was the perfect way to end our 3-hour tour and a spot I'm definitely putting on my list for a future visit to the area."}
{"text":"Really arrogant bartender. Got there with a bachelorette party (later in the evening so didn't care to serve us.)   Asked at the very end of the night to give me a cup of Water and his response was \"do I look like a bar back? Did have gloves on?"}
{"text":"Kelly's for a bar scene.. great! Dinner.. Meh. There's a lot more places around the block that I would choose to go to over Kelly's. On Friday night, Old Town Scottsdale was packed! I'm guessing the Waste Management PHX Open crowd all headed that way. So after trying 3-4 restaurants and getting 2+ hour waits, we came to Kelly's. It was around 730PM and the bar scene was already in full force but we found a table right away. I got the short rib tacos (appetizer) & they were okay. There was red pepper on it that was super spicy and overpowered the flavor of the meat. But once I took those off, I got more flavor and they were better. My boyfriend got the Kelly's burger, it was pretty good. Total was $42 for one glass of red wine (14 hands merlot -- $8?), 1 beer, short rib tacos, & a burger. It wasn't bad but just with all of the choices near by, I would probably go elsewhere & come here after for some drinks or for a night out."}
{"text":"Wine down Wednesday was fun with some co-workers they have 1/2 off bottles of wine even the good stuff. Atmosphere was awesome had a live band on the outdoor patio that was good. Not the usual Snottsdale crowd so it was a great time."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing burgers! This is an awesome place to hang out with friends. Make sure and sit outside if you can."}
{"text":"First time there last night for a special event. So far, I am digging it. I really enjoyed the decor. It felt cozy and spacious, which is hard to find in Scottsdale. Things tend to get crowded quickly, but I felt there were tons of places for me to stand or sit down without getting smooshed (I'm a shawty). I went during Happy Hour so the drink specials were great. $4 for a well drink. Normal hours seemed to have slightly expensive cocktails for my taste, but nothing horribly overpriced. My friend and I split the chicken sandwich which had a delicious fig spread on it. The chicken was very tender and there was enough food to fill both of us. We migrated to the patio where I had a cider beer for only $6, very tasty. My friend had their strawberry shamrock which was BOMB. Whoa! I barely got a sip in before she sucked it down. Damn Vanessa! It was actually a fairly nice, breezy night last night, which made for that much nicer of an evening. I had a great time and would love to come back and try the full menu. Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"Food was jsut ok.  Tried the Kelly's original four cut burger and wasn't impressed.  Had a better burger at Zin Burger.  But the atmosphere is very nice.  The Moscow mule was great.  I think this is the place that charges you if you take the copper cup the Moscow mule is served in.  It didn't matter to me as I don't see why people would steel that copper cup.  My friend had the fish and chips, it was good, nothing spectacular.  Love the patio."}
{"text":"Restaurant by day, club by night.  I hate this place, and I always get dragged here.  The inside and outside patio is always full. After a certain time of night, you cant get to the bar. So youre reduced to going to the mini bar/beer tub outside. Every time Ive been out there, the bartender has been so rude. Hes looked right past me to the skimpily clad girl behind me even though its a line format outside.  While they do have decent taps (my only reason for 2 stars), their mixed drinks are not very good. Theyre not well mixed. Its either way too strong or barely any alcohol.  I have tasted their food, and it was good, but that was at an event off of their property.  If you like loud clubs w/ terrible drinks, come here after 9pm. Youll have a blast."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place.   I would venture to say I come in here at least once a week.   Very cool atmosphere and the porch is by far my favorite in Old Town Scottsdale.   Last time I went I ordered the ribeye steak sandwich. The steak was cooked and sliced to perfection. I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Kelly's is one of my go-to spots for watering holes in Old Town. I don't feel \"too old\" here but I also don't feel the place is crawling w/geriatrics either. Good diverse mix of ppl.  It's pretty chill still around 9 or 10p ish but then gets pretty packed around 11 onward.  The servers are so COOL and nice. I always try to tip pretty generously w/them.  Try to ceviche here also - it's tasty. Have a friend who puffs cancer sticks? Send them on their merry way out to the patio w/the other puffers."}
{"text":"Awesome Moscow Mules! Although, they are a little pricey...go during happy hour when at least they're $4 off :)   The outside patio is nice and cozy, as long as the weather is tolerable. The food is pretty good; however, I always have trouble deciding on something to eat there. Nothing really sticks out for me. But yet I keep going back!   Psst...it's the Mules ;)"}
{"text":"Kelly's is so fun. The bar has a pool table and a DJ that plays a great mix on the weekend.  We just stumbled upon Kelly's after dinner in Old Town. There are several bars to choose from in Scottsdale it's nice this one has great music and a friendly staff. The crowd was a good mix too. Not too old or too young. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped in with my wife to get something to eat. We were not prepared. We are from San Diego and have no history of eating at Pubs. This place is amazing with a capital Zing! Their food is incredible. Good Lord what a find."}
{"text":"Went dinner last Saturday I had the worst dinning experience ever . My drinks took for ever than they came they tasted watered down , then we ordered dinner food was cold , the manger never came by to see if they could do anything . I hope all the new restaurants in old town do better Kellys is not worth the stop."}
{"text":"I just love this bar! Great atmosphere friendly bar tenders.   I have not tried the food yet but have heard good things. All ages are at this bar."}
{"text":"Came here with ~20 coworkers and friends around 11pm last Friday night. We stood patiently at the bar waiting to be served (or even acknowledged/looked at) for over 20 mins. None of the bartenders paid any attention to us and continued to serve the older customers who had approached the bar after us. We all left and went to a bar down the street in the main entertainment district where we were served almost immediately after walking in.   Really disappointed with the service we experienced, especially because my friends and I really love the general environment and vibe that Kelly's offers. Waiting for a drink for 20 mins would have been ok with most of us if any of our orders had actually been taken but being ignored for 20 straight mins doesn't sit well."}
{"text":"Not warm and fuzzy at all..female bartender kind of ignored us at first..menu VERY limited..bartenders are not familiar with menu..food so so...will not go back"}
{"text":"I would have given Kelly's 5 stars based on food, drink, atmosphere, and happy hour alone. But the service was not great.  I'll start with the good: There was a huge group of us celebrating a friend's birthday during happy hour. The sitting areas were quite cozy and perfect for a large group. There was a lot of food ordered. The happy hour prices on munchies were great. I tasted the jalapeno dip, fingerling potatoes, and the stuffed mini peppers. The dip was delicious, spicy, and rich. Fingerling potatoes were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and served with a delicious dip. Mini peppers were stuffed with a mild cheese and topped with a balsamic drizzle. So good! The cocktails were priced very well during happy hour and they were great. I had a couple Arizona mules. I also tasted a whiskey cocktail my friend had and thought it was tasty.  The bad: the service! Our server was pretty much non-existent. Most of the time we ordered our food and drinks from the bar. The bartenders were not very friendly. They spent a lot of time catering to and chatting up regulars. Our empty dishes were piling up at our table. Sadly enough, we found an empty cart nearby and cleared our table ourselves.   I think a 3 star rating is very generous considering our experience with service but I rounded up because the good outweighs the bad. We will definitely be back and hopefully I will be able to bump my rating up."}
{"text":"We. Love. This. Spot. But what's not to love? Kelly's at Southbridge has everything, great ambiance, great food, great people and ohhh those comfy couches. We are a huge fan of soft-seating, being the social type, and Kelly's has arranged couch clusters all over for your seating enjoyment.  Like pool? Want to take on some friends and show off your moves? Kelly's has a pool table, dart board and lots of TV's to keep you entertained... no reason to be bored here. Both times we've been here (on a Thursday around 6pm), they have had a great crowd and lots of fun people. Definitely a place you feel like staying and hanging out in.  Okay on to the important stuff, the food and drink! Kelly's has Happy Hour from 4 PM to 7 PM Mon - Fri. Which includes $3 Domestic bottles, $4 Premium bottles, $4 Craft beer, $4 Wells, $5 Calls, $2 off all glasses of wine and  1/2 price Kelly's cocktails so everyone should be covered with something they like to drink.  Now I need to pull you aside and assure you that the next thing I am going to discuss is a not to miss item. I'm just going to come right out and say it... Roasted Brussels Sprouts. There it's out. I know, I know, you hate Brussels Sprouts, I know I'm not a fan of them either. But trust me, you don't want to miss these. The Brussels Sprouts come mixed with a candied bacon and are roasted to perfection. This is a house specialty and too good to miss. Trust me.  Read the entire review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=915"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and had a burger with a fried egg....wow. Drinks are always good and the place is clean. Adam was the bartender that took care of us and he did so for quote a while. We arrived around 6pm and by the time we left it was almost midnight...we were ready to eat again!!! Night crowd picked up but the place didn't get too rowdy. It's a spot to go on the weekends or weekdays alike and you will get the same type of environment. Good food, good drinks, and great service. We'll be back over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"I like the patio here a greeat deal.  Correction: I like the patio here before 10 pm. Then it becomes clubby.  Ick.  Once the guys dipped in hair gel, the girls teetering on stripper heels, and the want to be seen crowd roll in, I have to bolt. 'Tis a shame because this is a great location and a huge patio.  The bartenders are very quick and they have a great happy hour, but if you are over 35, it's kinda sad after 10 pm.  Unless you're a Cougar.. then you may love it."}

{"text":"This was my 1st time ever here.  Jacqueline was our server and she was wonderful.  The food was amazing and the atmosphere is really cool"}
{"text":"I hate writing negative things about places I love. I really do love Kellys. They have one of the best patios around and its always fun.  Some friends and I were here for happy hour and things started off great - great drinks, great apps - had the ceviche and one of the bruschetta's (forget which one and not even sure if thats spelled correctly but it was awesome).   Our friends met up with us and decided that we should stay for dinner. I've eaten there but not a full dinner - their apps are always so good so what could go wrong with dinner right? So we order another app for the table and it never comes out. We make a comment to our waitress and from her reaction, we know she forgot to order it. Cool - it happens, all of us either work or have worked in the restaurant industry and we know what its like when it gets busy.   So she walks away and one of our friends food comes out. She comes back over and tells us that she straight out forgot to order the app and its also been 86'd so we can't get it anyway. Our friend already had her food so we were like whatever, our food will come out soon too. So about 10 minutes later 2 more plates come out. We told our friend to eat before so by the time their food came out, she was well into her dish. We wait about another 10 minutes or so and my food never comes out. So after another 10 minutes we finally get our waitress over and come to find out my dish had been 86'd too. By the time we figure this all out, my friends were done with their meals and I had nothing. Their food was good - Kelly's food is always good.  Our waitress comped my meal and I was able to order something new, but it took another 20 minutes to get that out. I wasn't even hungry anymore and frustrated so I asked for it to go. Normally I don't bother telling a manager or anything, I'm not one to complain too much and usually just go on my way, but this was pretty bad. I had to ask to see a manager 3 times and he was not quick to come to us.  So I finally talked to the manager and am really positive about it all - I really do get it! Shit happens but I think it was really important for him to know what went down. I wasn't looking to get anything for free - I did already when she comped my meal.  Needless to say it wasn't a perfect experience but I will be back because I really do love the place and hope/think this was just a fluke. My burger was great once I got home and I hope my next review will be a perfect 5 star review cause they do deserve that next time."}
{"text":"Food is great and so is the service.  I have been here on multiple occasions and have enjoyed it every time.  The waiters and management are very friendlly and make sure everything is great.   Plus, they have a putting green, which I sunk three hole in ones, kind of fun.   Free champagne on ladies night rocks."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance in the heart of old town. Outdoor seating near the canal makes for a nice eating experience.   Chicken salad was nothing special or inventive, but hit the spot, and was a decent size.  Southbridge chicken sandwich with spinach and cheese...yum. Huge sandwich, totally worth it.  I highly recommend substituting the vegetables as a side, rather than fries. They were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Skillet potato appetizer was also really good, well seasoned and delicious sauce.   1/2 price appetizers before 7pm.   Kind of expensive ($14 per meal) but with it for a nice experience."}
{"text":"Sadly dissapointed. My boyfriend had been to Kelly's once before and raved about it,  so when we chose this place for a celebratory dinner, on works dime, we thought we picked the right place. Wrong.  We ordered two appetizers...one of them never came.  When asked, the server had forgotten to place the order.  Accidents happen,  but when she brought the pork dish out it was freezing. I'm not talking warm either. Me, the life long vegetarian touched the inside of it and it was strait out of the refrigerator. Gross.       Next we ordered the roasted brussle sprouts. They were absolutely disgusting.  First of all they were boiled. Boiled not roasted. Soggy boiled sprouts with an \"aged\" basalmic sauce.  The sauce tasted fishy and we barely managed two a piece.    Our entrees were decent...I opted for a salad (vegetarian) and he had the ribeye.  Let me be clear,  the kitchen could use some adjustment, but the service was good and the staff was friendly.  Let's just say the next time we go it will only be for happy hour drinks on the cute patio."}
{"text":"Well, not sure if my single visit here on a not-so-busy Sunday night (the day before NYE to be exact) is necessarily a \"typical\" experience this place can be judged by, but I like what I saw (and drank).  Even with the location, I'm actually kind of shocked from reading the reviews this place is actually as crowded as it sounds like on a Saturday night. Even though there's a large bar, pool tables, and couches, I got more a restaurant vibe so I figured it would attract a more casual, early crowd. Although, I will say the \"Irish pub\" theme here is a little more \"upscale\" and less \"hole-in-the-wall.\"  Like I said, I was here on a Sunday, when Kelly's has all day happy hour (another reason my experience here was pretty positive). HH at Kelly's is $4 off there fancier normally $10-$12 cocktails & $2 off there normally $6 beers. $4 Kilt Lifters? I can dig it (and I did!).  Maybe if I came here for dinner or on a late Saturday night I might have felt differently about this place, but my experience at Kelly's was pretty positive and I'd come back...especially during HH (which I believe is 3-7 Mon-Sat, and all day Sunday)."}
{"text":"I'm going to review for what it is and that would be a college level dive bar type place.  A good size with actually pretty quick service with large crowd.  Nice outdoor patio with a lot of misters making it comfortable outside in the summer."}
{"text":"My friend saw the spot on TV for Kelly's with the chef plating a few dishes and he wanted to go try it out....stopped in around 2pm on a Wed...service was exceptional, I forget her name, but she was knowledgeable, friendly, helpful (sounds like the Girl Scout oath) but she was all that and payed attention to details, like replacing dirty forks!  Food was phenomal !! We tried quite a bit off the menu (thanks to corporate Amex) and the stand outs were the 4 meat burger, duck sandwich, chicken sandwich, housemade pickles, chickpea fries, and the watermelon salad.  Hands down probably the best burger I have had in town!!  Hat's off to the chef's and managers!!  Will be back on a Friday night to hang at the bar!"}
{"text":"Okay Kelly's is a great place to meet friends hand have a drink and maybe a bit to eat.  I like it here.  There is lots of places to just hang out and get to know people or catch up with friends!    Is it load -  yes Is it a little expensive - yes Is the service a little slow- yes  Is there a velvet rope - yes But really this is old town what else would you expect!    Oooo and if you do decide to have dinner here.... I give the short ribs a 5!"}
{"text":"Wonderful patio, nice quiet setting, and a great staff. Their bruschetta and salads are fantastic and the kitchen is top notch."}
{"text":"Cocktails and appetizers were great. Great service as well!!! I wouldn't ever choose to sit inside here.The atmosphere is like a dive bar, but they do have great seating outside. The brussels sprouts are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"stopped for some lovely bruschetta and glass of wine after shopping on Marshall Way.  here's pics of the patio..."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Love coming here with friends and just hangout.  You don't really see many Scottsdale DB's here which is nice.  The staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place!  They have a huge bar with comfy seats.  It really feels like Cheers in here.  They have this amazing drink called the Desert Howler with passion fruit in it.  I love fruity drinks and I could drink a lot of these!  They also had a drink with jalapenos in it.  Can't remember the name but this was a unique and tasty treat as well.  They have a nice patio with mysters if you are a smoker.  This bar has ample seating with comfy tables and booths, along with couches to just sit and sip their awesome cocktails.  The bar and wait staff are hotties too!  You will enjoy yourself here!"}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere with great drink specials and exceptionally good food. My friend had the beer mac & cheese, which of course was to die for. I enjoyed the chicken salad which also exceeded my expectations. The tuna tartare was on point! And only $7 during happy hour. The fingerling potatoes (pictured) were phenomenal and only $5 during happy hour. And the bacon & bleu cheese stuffed olives were the cherry on top of everything!"}
{"text":"This places sucks for service. Went in there 2 Saturdays nights ago about 10p. Place was packed. My wife and I squeeze our way up to the bar. There were 4 bartenders and I counted at least 15 other people standing around the square bar waiting patiently for drinks just like I was. I literally stood there for over 9 minutes (yes I timed it) and no one was being helped. No one. The 4 bartenders were washing glasses and looking at tickets and talking to each other. Every single one of them were avoiding eye contact with everyone as if to say \"we'll get to you when we feel like getting to you\". They were just taking their sweet time as if no one was there. I looked around the bar and made eye contact with a few others waiting too and they gave me the same \"wtf\" look too. I just put my 20 away and walked out. What a joke of a place."}
{"text":"Everyone's food, I had fish and chips, was cold and soggy. But the service was really good and they have great happy hour deals."}
{"text":"I had my bachelorette party here this spring and it was perfect. We were able to snag the VIP couch area, had speciality drinks made just for us, and service was better than we could've expected. We only had to make reservations a week in advance! We just snacked but their fries are super tasty and the drinks even better. Thanks for making my special event unforgettable!"}
{"text":"After calling over 10 restaurants to take our group of 12 on a Saturday night we thankfully, finally found Kelly's at Southbridge to accomodate us at 7:30.   Located in a part of Old town where there are over 78 bars and restaurants we found Valet parking right next door to restaurant.   When we arrived, they had our table set up so we all took our seats.   The restaurant was dark and the crowd was mid 20s on up.   The Nay is the service kinda sucked. It took us over 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to order our food.  By the time our food came it was another 10 minutes we all were hungry.  Another Nay was the music (today's hits, which I loved) but, was really loud so we all were yelling to hear one another.   The Yay is the food is Dope (Young kids Slang for good) My word is awesome, if you watch the Bachelor it's Amazing.   Either way said, this food rocked. My girlfriend and I shared so we ordered the Brussel sprouts, so yummy made with a balsamic glaze with chunks of Pancetta.   We also had the Caprese salad. For our entre we had the slow cooked short rib. Wow was this good. (I shouldn't have worn white).  The rib was cooked in a tomato sauce. Served over mashed potato and topped off with an over easy egg. My husband asked if I ordered a local moco, which is a dish in Hawaii with rice, hamburger steak, topped off with over easy egg and brown gravy.   Anyway, other delicious meals ordered were the Salmon. Seasoned perfect and cooked moist. My husband ordered the Pork chop. Cooked just right so the juice was sealed in.   Overall minus the wait, I have to say a strong Yay to the quality of the food. Come try."}
{"text":"Went here to watch football with some friends and they were very accommodating for our antics. Lots of space in the back and fun games to play. The food was tasty and the drinks were cold. If you're looking for a super social location, this is not the place. It was pretty dead considering it was a football Sunday with the cardinals playing, but a good low key place to go with friends if you want to be able to actually hear them when they talk."}
{"text":"I love Kelly's...in the light of day.  Almost every single Saturday and/or Sunday over the past few months has been spent with my friends on the patio here.  They have half priced bottles of wine, comfy couches, and friendly servers-- what's not to love?!  We are also big fans of the pork wings appetizer.  It sounds weird-- what exactly is a pork wing?-- but they're delicious.  Kelly's is always packed at night, but that's typically when we head out.  In my personal opinion, the dbag ratio increases the later it gets, but I guess that's what you expect anywhere in Old Town.  But if you're looking for a great patio to hang out on and do some day drinking, this is the spot!  Just leave a couch open for us ;)"}
{"text":"Kelly's is by far one of my favorite places in Old Town for a night out. I like that it's casual yet still dressy and slightly upscale. You know what I mean? Like it still feels like Scottsdale nightlife but not what people think of as Scottsdale nightlife that has them fleeing to Tempe or Phoenix. Great house cocktails (AZ Mule is a must try) and generally a good mix between \"beautiful people\" and average folks. In fact, I would say the crowd is diverse by Scottsdale standards. I mostly come here at night but the food is pretty good too. One thing to note (and I say this only because I've seen many a person fall for this) there is one bathroom that is in plain sight and it's a onesie but that's not the only bathroom walk passed the bar and hang a left. I know, what a silly and unsexy thing to write about in a review of a sexy little bar but I know every woman reading this can attest that knowing the bathroom situation is important. :-)"}
{"text":"Not a good place. WAY over proceed for what it is, just a COMPLETE waste of time. Just go ANYWHERE else"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and great patio. This place gets packed Friday and Saturday nights. We came early after a Spring Training game and had some drinks and food. The brussel sprouts were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is a casual bar with a kind of older-ish crowd (older than most of old town). Still kind of frat-y/cliquey."}
{"text":"For $20 at the side door Andrew will let you skip the line. This place is over rated."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Scottsdale, far and away. We go here at least twice a month and love their drinks! I love their Titos Tea which I don't think they have on the menu anymore, but you gotta ask for it!   My favorite thing to order is the meat and cheese boards which is so delicious, but the presentation is really the best part. It's always different and has tons of cheese and bread and fruit and smears of fruit! Yummy!!   My friends and I really love the atmosphere at Kelly's and always have a great time when we go there. It's a nice place because it's more chill than the rest of the places in scottsdale so you can go out and have fun without the club atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and was very happy we did! Food was excellent. The chicken sandwich with the fresh cooked spinach was delicious & they have great onion straws. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Our server Miranda was so awesome!!! Will definitely be back and ask to be sat in her section."}
{"text":"I dig this place! The staff is friendly, the food solid, the atmosphere fun and casual. A nightclub for adults who have thrown away their shiny shirts and Versace suits. A fun time with good eats. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Had some great service and delicious food! It was our first time there and we plan on going back. The pricing is pretty reasonable, about as much as you would pay at a chain restaurant, but with much better quality food. Had a nice atmosphere, spacious seating outside and a warm interior. To make it even better they have a fantastic happy hour, half priced apps and bruschetta, along with some well priced drinks.  Had some great food, I totally recommend the roasted fingerling potatoes and the  doughnut holes!"}
{"text":"Dinner on a Monday night.  Ate outside. Excellent service. We had the Kelleys burger and the Parmesan chicken.  Enjoyed the meal and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Max the bartender makes a mean Bloody Mary. Great place! Go!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 7, sat on patio. Glad I read the other reviews, it helps me understand why some rate it 4 & 5 stars. Yes, great big patio, spacious, pool tables, couch sitting areas, dark wood, white trim, good happy hour prices. Unfortunately, we went there because we were just hungry, and our first choice stopped serving food at 9 pm. So they sent us to Kelly's.   We chose to sit outside, which turned out to be right under the speaker, blaring old 80's rock. The waitress was nice about us asking her to turn it down a bit, as we couldn't really hear each other across the table.   We ordered a cheese plate, 2 grilled artichoke apps, a Mac and cheese, and wine. The cheese plate was mediocre, nothing special, and smaller cheese plate portions than most we order: 8-10 Marcona almonds, some gelatinous slices that we think were pear flavored, a few baguette slices (& I mean A FEW, stingy for 2 of us), and very small portions of cheeses that really weren't too special.   The grilled artichoke app was a failure for us: way too oily, and absolutely not worth the $10. The leaves were small and not very meaty; I think these were puny artichokes to start. When we were done with it, we felt like we had paid just to scrape our teeth on some leaves; it literally took NO edge off our hunger. (Suggestion: If they are that small, give us 3 halves, or put them on \"sale\" so we don't feel ripped off). In comparison, we just had an AMAZING arti app at a long-standing local restaurant (same name as a city in TX that starts with an \"H\") where it too costs $10, but was worth every penny because it was prepared & seasoned perfectly, moist & meaty, and actually made us feel as if we ate something in exchange for money.  The mac and cheese was the tastiest thing, with a lot of mixed cheeses and a little jalapeno kick - nice.  The wine was fine, but for $10/glass, it should be.  I guess this is a weekend packed hot-spot, I can see the potential. Just don't go here for \"real dinner,\" and at this time, Tuesdays aren't a hot night at Kelly's."}
{"text":"Huge inside with tons of seating which rocks.   Big, cool patio- but why not add some live music  or a dj out there??    Bartendars are not friendly or helpful. Been here 1/2 dozen times and all they say is \"what do you want to drink?\" . Would love a friendly staff- it would make me want to come here more often"}
{"text":"Got turned away from the Herb so we walked across the street. Got great service. Special brunch drinks and kids meals. Good food and service. More of a pub style sport bar."}
{"text":"Cool hang out place. They have 2 pool tables and a nice sized bar. Would definitely be back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Very much a gastro-pub offering an eclectic and exciting menu of well prepared items made with the finest and freshest ingredients. The chicken wings and fish and chips are both solid. I hear the brussel sprouts are a winner too. They also have several specialty cocktails that make this a great stop to get your night started. I have not been here late night for drinks yet, word on the street is that the douche factor is in effect.  UPDATE: Saturday night for dinner and drinks, and while several douches were present most of the crowd was really chill. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"The first time I was here was for a party of about 30 that I had planned. I had never been here before, or even heard of Kelly's. I just knew the area that we wanted to be in and used Yelp to find a place with good reviews. I called and made the reservations but was leary after talking to whomever answered the phone. Leary because anywhere else I had called had me speak with someone in catering, asked a bunch of questions and would email me a quote. This was nothing like that, but everything worked perfectly (you can read my initial review about that experience) I was recently tasked with planning another party, this time a birthday for my boyfriend. Kelly's was my first choice. I called and made reservations easily and was very excited to go there again.A few of us arrived about 10 minutes early, and they accomodated us by rushing to clear off the table that was reserved for us. As experienced the previous time, staff was friendly and service was great. Here are the reasons I lowered my review to four stars, rather than 5 again: 1. Most of us did not have utensils, napkins or plates by the time appetizers were served. 2. My boyfriends burger was very undercooked (medium, maybe even medium rare rather than well-done). He's kind of picky, but didn't notice right away (it was dark outside) but lost his appetite once he saw how pink and bloody the burger was. He told the server who offered to replace it but he declined. And still paid for it. In my opinion (and I've never worked food service so this may not be realistic) but if you're going to offer to make him a new burger, and he declines, why not  just not charge him for the burger instead? 3. Location of our table. We were on the patio at a table long enough for the 16 of us there. Our table was off to the front side of the patio near the entrance and is quite narrow. There would usually be enough room still for people to walk past us when everyone was seated, however there was some holiday decore out which took up a bit of space. Customers and staff still continued to use this walk way continuously bumping into us or making us move our chairs in while we ate. So all that said, had this been my first experience, I would have scored Kelly's with 3 stars. But here's what made a potential 3 star review, a 4 star review 1. Our server Sarah. She was the same server I had at the previous event. She is friendly, patient and knowledgable of the menu. 2. Our water glasses were never less than half full. 3. The food and drinks were brought out almost as quickly as they were ordered. 4. We asked for, and got, individual bills (you'll understand what a big deal this is for us if you saw my review of AMF Lanes). So all that, plus the experience of our previous visit increased my review from 3-4 stars. This is one of my new favorite restaurants, hands down."}
{"text":"This is a great place to people watch if you can get through the door.  Kelly's started off as a quiet bar in Old Town and now you must wait in line.  I have to admit the drinks at the this place are great.  The Moscow Mules and Arizona Mules are delicious.  Don't walk away with the silver or cooper mug, they will charge you.  The food and drinks prices are reasonable. I love the lounge-feel of Kelly's.  They have tons of indoor and outdoor seating.  If darts are your game, check out the back room.  I have only been here for drinks but I'll to visit to check out their food menu."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with Kelly's as a restaurant.  Half of the menu was unavailable while I was there because they were in the middle of changing it.  Everything I wanted was not available.  Once I received my food, it wasn't the best either.  It was a sandwich.  How hard is that to make?    Anyway, this place is better for drinking and going out, not eating.  All of the old town people go here now, so it's one of the new hot spots.  I'm not sure I love the crowd though.  It's filled with bitchy girls and douchebags.  Check it out for yourself if you'd like."}
{"text":"A waitress decided to tip herself 5$ when she provided horrible service to me and my plus 1. fraudulent place check your account after leaving. I can not believe I have to worry about something so petty in Scottsdale , maybe if your employees were polite and actually were more attentive they would not have to worry about stealing."}
{"text":"I hate giving less than good reviews but this place was one of our favorite dinner spots.  We would have dinner and then walk around Waterfront and Old Town Scottsdale.  It was always such an enjoyable experience.  Not so much this time.  The food was less than average and extremely disappointing.  Not sure if they changed chefs or what.  My wife had the braised short ribs and if I remember right it used to be served on polenta it is now served on mashed potatoes with an egg on the top?  My wife also said the short ribs were stringy and a bit tough, not tender at all.  My filet mignon was also served on some of the lumpiest garlic mashed potatoes I've ever eaten.  The filet had a different odd taste to it and not so good.  The rock shrimp cevichi which is our favorite was not very fresh this time.  Last but not least our waitress took a long time to get to us.  Our Cevichi arrived way before our drinks.  I was almost tempted to not wait for the waitress and get up and order a drink while we waited for our other drink. All in all not an experience that would bring me back in the door again.  The jury is still out on whether this is still one of our go to places.  I will have to give them credit though  they did pay for our drink."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday night for a friends Birthday Party.  It was super easy to make reservations for a big group, and they didn't have a minimum charge like some of the other near by places. We were even able to reserve some \"vip' couch space for the group with only a few days notice.  The Happy hour specials are great! Including half off a bottle of wine from 3-7, even on Saturdays! Food wise, My boyfriend and I ordered the Kelly Burger with Truffle Fries and the beer mac ad cheese.   The burger was really good. The fries were ok- not what we were expecting, they were just regular fries with a tiny bit of truffle oil, so only some of the fries had any truffle flavor.  I do not recommend the mac and cheese at all. My boyfriend wouldn't even eat it and he is much lest picky than I am. The sauce was thin and did not have much of a cheese taste at all, it was actually sweet- which was really gross combined with the jalapenos, ( I think they were pickled, they were very mild) and the Bacon.   Over all it was a great atmosphere, and we really enjoyed the night. (Even without drinking.)"}
{"text":"Awesome night out with the girls.  The food and drinks and Kelly's was awesome.   Kelly's has a putting green pool tables, darts and the best outdoor patio in old town Scottsdale.  Parking was simple.  A great night out!  Thank you John Anthony. This is a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday.  We were a party of 15, but we had a nice spot in the restaurant for our group.  The place was packed and the decor is nice.  It's a nice addition to the old town bars in scottsdale.  Before I go to a new restaurant I like to check out the menu beforehand online.  The menu looked great online so I was excited for dinner.  When we got to the restaurant though, the menu was only a portion of what was posted online.  The options were limited to say the least, and we were disappointed.    I ordered the cheviche as an appetizer and then the fish and chips for dinner.  The cheviche was good, not great.  The tortilla chips that came with were more chewy than crispy.  The fish and chips were also good, but I was surprised that the chips was literal vs. the british \"chip\"/french fries.  They were homemade and yummy, but just not expected.  The aoli was bland, could have used more spice.  Considering the prices it could have been better, adequate, but not something I would say \"hey, let's have a great dinner out at Kelly's\".  There are other restaurants in Scottsale for that.  My friend ordered the roasted chicken, which was one of the rare non-sandwiches on the menu, and she loved it.  It's decent quality food... good but not great.  The wait staff was pleasant, but we were left unattended too much.  The bussing should have been more frequent and we were left trying to hunt down the waiter to get our checks.  He did offer to split them up individually, which is rare, so that was appreciated.  Overall I'll go back for drinks and the atmosphere, but I would prefer to eat someplace else for a big dinner out."}
{"text":"My husband Mike and I just found Kelly's walking around Scottsdale near the canal. What a surprise to find a place with great food and friendly servers.  Lauren L the Mgr/bartender on duty was so helpful and kind. She let us Mae choices and gave us the feeling she was glad we came.  Overall it was a truly great lunch."}
{"text":"Kelly's at Southbridge is super cute place in old town Scottsdale, came in for just a drink before event not far away.   Dirty Martini with Titos was perfectly made, and mighty tasty.  Service; Everyone was VERY friendly."}
{"text":"Well Executed, Tasty Dishes  We ordered the tuna tartare over a salad (in place of Yucca chips) and the Southbridge Chicken Sandwich. The tartare was a fresh, decent small plate. The chicken sandwich was good, and we loved the fried onion straws! Our waitress was friendly, and the ambience is nice. The happy hour deal is okay, but prices are more reflective of the central Scottsdale location than food. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"We ate at the bar.  The appetizers are really small.  They were excellent,  but very small.   I got the Short Rib sandwich.   It was good.   Everything looked good and I would come back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I've been here since I moved but still such a great joint! The chicken wings are lights out, the tuna app was the best I ever had! The place is a great lay out. We played pool for hours. Such a great fun place to hang out. I didn't like the tea sandwich though. Kind of salty and the bread was too thick but that's just me. Everything else was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a nice lunch here with co-workers. The service was good, a little slow, but we weren't in a rush. The salad I ordered was delicious and the server kept our drinks full. Thanks for a nice dining experience.   P.S. I didn't pay for the bill, but I think it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about age mix. And this past Saturday that was true, especially before 930. Then a younger crowd. All good so far.  But because your blonde and kind of hot ( 2 of the bartenders ) that doesnt mean you cant smile or attempt to be pleasant. You are in the service industry.  That was my first opinion of bartenders but it was then backed up by a group of women  with whom I started a conversation   Resting bitch face doesnt work when youre on that side of bar"}
{"text":"Loved the patio! Went at about 6:30 for dinner. Perfect timing as it was still light out but the sun was going down and the atmosphere was very cool.  Started to get busy after we sat down.  My favorite thing about this place was the location, the patio, the atmosphere.  We ordered the fried mushroom appetizer which isn't on the regular menu.  It was a special for football.  Unfortunately, it was rather tasteless.  It came with ranch to dip it in and that is the only part of the dish that had any flavor.  The mushrooms were very bready and soo hot inside that the juice burned my tongue!!  For our meal we decided on the Beer Mac n Cheese and the Fish and Chips.  We told them we were going to split them and they were nice enough to split it for us and bring us each our own serving of both dishes!  Nice touch!!  The Mac n' cheese was Awesome!!! So flavorful and delicious.  However, I am glad we split it because a full serving would have been too much... it was very rich and by my last forkful, I started get tired of it.  The fish and chips were not good.  The batter was the same batter they used for the fried mushrooms.  It had no flavor.  The fish itself was also pretty tasteless.  The chips were ok....thinly sliced potatoes that weren't that hot.   The service was fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary but no complaints whatsoever on that front.   All that being said, I would definitely go back!!  I think I would get a burger next time...I read they won an award for their burgers and their patio!!  Even though our food choices left us dissatisfied, I know that there is something better on the menu for the next time."}
{"text":"Have been to Kelly's several times, the last trip was on June 9.  Every experience has been poor service. The last trip,  the bar staff looked right at me and did not even approach to take my order, but she was happy to chat at length with another patron.  It took over 5 minutes to finally get someone to place an order for just a drink.  Place doesn't really have much of a \"Happy Hour\" either."}
{"text":"What a delightful treat! My friend and I popped in for a very short breakfast before a beauty appointment in that area. I'm *still* kicking myself we ran short on time!    We were greeted warmly by the bartender and asked to seat ourselves anywhere. Oof! Was this difficult! So many appealing choices to pick from. Ultimately we settled ourselves on these super comfortable couches. After explaining our schedule constraints to Ashlynn (who rocks it with her blue tipped hair) our food came out in short order.  Lest I forget, their coffee is served with a treat of sweet heavy cream. I missed the introduction as I was powdering my nose. But it is sufficiently flavored that many may not need sugar. Yum!  Their cheese board is ginormous! I love cheese and was craving something warm so we also ordered the mac & cheese WITH BACON. Yes. That exists. You should try that if you're ever in the mood for some comfort food. Be warned this is 1) not diet food 2) very filling 3) should be shared.   I did not share it.  Go ahead. Judge.  This place is bookmarked for me to return! I definitely would like to sample their drinky treats and lounge when I have more time. Super, super cute place! Big fan of how nice and friendly all the servers were."}
{"text":"Yes! Everything about our experience was fantastic! It's a really fun place to take friends for dinner & drinks! The music is a tad loud for a dinner spot but I still really like it. We went with a group of 6. They seated us in a huge booth that was very spacious and comfortable also very promptly. We were then greeted  by our server that was amazing! She was friendly and has actually tried everything on the menu which is very rare to find now a days. The fish & chips and black and blue hamburger are great. Some of our table guest tried the steak sandwich and weren't the biggest fans. We also has some truffle fries that were really good. The drinks are a tad pricey but are you in a trendy  restaurant in old town Scottsdale so you get what you pay for. We had a birthday in our group and they don't sing HBD it's not that type of place but they do bring a deep fried doughnut balls and candles and they brought enough for everyone in the group which was really sweet! I saw looking at the menu they have a great happy hour on Sunday so I'm going to try them out again and update on that and actually take some photos! At night, I don't think it's kid friendly but wheelchair ok, great for big groups or celebrating and you'll spend about $20-35 for dinner and drink but portions or huge and good quality food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's new and confused.  Disclaimer (my evening was tainted with my bad mood associated with the fact that I had to drive that evening).    Ok, so Kelly's seems to want to be an Irish pub/bar.  It's huge and every room has a different feel.  The bar itself is very pubish (nice wood, cool globe lights) however, the patio would be best described as Tuscan (a region not found in Ireland).  There's a private party room with couches.  Then a secret patio with only three tables.  A hidden room with darts.  An open area for maybe more private parties.  A \"lounge\" area with chandeliers (definitely not irish chandeliers).  The drinks were good.  The food looked tasty but small servings and big dollar signs (actually, the dollar signs were in a normal font size.  It is the numbers behind them that made me uncomfortable).  I got a vegetable sandwich with salmon on it.  I intentional called it vegetable with salmon instead of the otherway around.  But it was very tasty.  Great picnic food! Medium for an irish pub though.  It's a satisfying bar but don't expect it to be what you picture when you hear \"Kelly's\".  I'd return if friends were going but I wouldn't choose it on my own."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here but I go here for cocktails frequently. The environment is great, definitely a pleasant change from the normal Scottsdale party scene. It's rather chill and generally brings in a good crowd. The bartenders are typically attentive and you can generally get service relatively quickly. The facility is well taken care of and clean, they offer darts and an outside seating area. Over all, I enjoy the experience and will continue to come here, if you haven't been, I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is very large and spread out with multiple outdoor patios and inside areas.  Very classy feel and a lot of dressed up individuals.  Service could be a bit better but once they got the ball rolling they did okay.  We just had drinks so I can't speak for the food but I would like to eat here some time."}
{"text":"I was debating between a 3 and a 4 because Kelly's has some definite high points. I met a friend at Kelly's for happy hour and it was fairly happy. The best part of the experience was our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout our visit. She was fantastic, even when I was being ridiculously indecisive. Anyway, we each got a drink, I got the AZ mule and my friend had basically a vodka cranberry... both drinks were fine, but nothing special. For food, I had the pork wings and the short rib tacos. The pork was alright, tender and covered in a flavorful sauce, but the meat itself was a little gamey tasting. They were served over a super tasty spicy slaw, which I could have eaten all day. Despite this, I don't think I would order this again. The tacos were also fairly tasty, 3 tiny tacos with hot red peppers on top of short rib.... how bad can it be? Again, it was good, but not something I would crave necessarily. All the food and drink were reasonably priced on hh. I would come back here, but maybe order a bit differently next time.  PS I don't know what was going on, but their bathroom when I went was missing a door handle and a lock... could make for an awkward night...  PPS I really want to try their burgers... they looked really tasty!"}
{"text":"Damn hot blonde bartenders i'm talking about hot damn blonde bartenders it's Big league  time here"}
{"text":"A group of us left the Giants' Spring Training game and were solicited with coupons that said \"15% Off Entire Bill\" in bold print.  You would think \"Entire Bill\" meant ENTIRE bill.  But in the nice fine print down below it says excluding alcohol.      I work in marketing and I felt this was a deceptive and shady business practice.  I don't care about the extra money we didn't save; I just feel like we were tricked.    Scottsdale has a thousand other places that won't pull this on patrons, so please take your business to one of those."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a couple beers with some buddies after a meal up the street. This is a spacious and clean bar in the middle of a nice, more upscale shopping center. The large patio area would be perfect for soaking in the evening air or a large group gathering, and the large horseshoe bar had plenty of space to belly up should you want to spend a lot of time here.   Our server was sweet and attentive and the beer selection pretty decent. All in all, a great watering hole for those in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! Great food! Great desserts!!!! Great people and the ambience is great! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I was here for a Gentleman Jack event and I really enjoyed it! It has a really nice atmosphere and the food I tried was fantastic.  I can't wait to come back and actually have a full meal!"}
{"text":"Wandered into Kelly's on a Friday night before heading out in Scottsdale, and I wish we would have stayed at Kelly's for the entire night.  Although the front area seemed packed and loud like most bars, we were able to grab a (hefty) glass of red wine and move to the back, where we found multiple private areas where you can chat with friends on comfortable couches around a coffee table or play a round of darts.  Unlike many other areas in Scottsdale, where your shoes stick to the floor and you're constantly reminded of a college frat party, Kelly's manages to maintain an air of elegance.  From the wood paneling to the dark interior to the music volume control (you can actually hear the person next to you talking!), this is more of a lounge than anything else.  Keep it classy, Kelly's!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of my favorite bars in old town Tom has been my bartender the last few times and he is so knowledgeable of the drinks and food and always recommends such great things! If you can make it here for dinner sometime I recommend it."}
{"text":"We recently engaged Kelly's for our company holiday party for 250 and I have nothing to say except they really came through for us. We had been planning this event for weeks and, what with the company owners flying in with their guests, you just hope everything will go well. It was a smash.   Decor for the holidays was great. Not over stated, classic and welcoming. They were very accommodating about the music program, sitting with me before the party to develop a music mix of some of their regular program and a touch of current and jazz holiday favs. We even designed a company themed martini.   The kitchen went all out with pass around appetizers and the service staff was wonderful. Then came the main courses they are famous for and even a seafood gumbo we asked to be added. The buffet was constantly refilled and all the guests were really impressed. The food was always fresh and delicious.   Then to top off the evening, Coffee, Tea, and Cocoa with a delicious desert bar.   There were thank you's all around that evening and I understand the owners stayed till closing - I guessed they had a great time.  You really can't go wrong with these folks. They are pros and the venue is large but intimate. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Great Spot!! Good friendly crowd, easy on the eyes too ;).  Not your 'Scottsdale' El Hefe or Scottsdale guys/girls crowd.  Non 21-25 year old crowd:). Have fun, be nice to door guys...bartenders, fair."}
{"text":"Great go to spot with the crew on the weekend. Good drinks, good food, good service, have never had a problem there. Did my 30th birthday there last year, they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Loved the vibes here!  We were visiting from California and came here earlier this week and I've been wanting to come back ever since. Our server Jaclyn was amazing and seriously so sweet. Everything she recommended was exactly what I wanted. Get the beer Mac and cheese!! I love this place"}
{"text":"Genteel by day, crazy by evening.  I just wonder how those middle-aged ladies who lunch would react to the hormone driven scene after 9:00 each evening."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on Saturday night and sat on the patio. While the server was very sweet and the patio was nice, I don't anticipate returning.  The drink specials on Jameson were great.  I got some Jameson and Ginger Ales for only $4 each.    A couple members of my party were unhappy with their drinks (margaritas, martinis and complicated shots).  My drinks were great, so I cannot complain.  But it is worth noting that anything beyond two ingredients might be out of their expertise.    The food was just... ok.  I ordered the $15 steak sandwich, which came with a handful of fries.  The bread seemed quite stale and the steak tasted under-seasoned.  The roasted bell peppers seemed greasy.  The fries were just okay.  Still, I rarely send anything back and I was quite hungry.    Kelly's is a nice place for people watching, but there are better patios just across the street.  For the price point they're at, I think there are a number of better choices."}
