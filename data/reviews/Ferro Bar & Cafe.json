{"text":"I just joined Yelp not too long ago and just started to review restaurants.  I've been a regular on and off at Ferro's for over 15+ years and I never had one dish that I disliked; and everyone I know who is a regular has never had a bad dish either until tonight. A few of us decided to eat \"family stye\" and ordered three dishes.  Two of my personal favourites -- Vongole Pasta and Funghi Risotto did not disappoint.  But the dish that I would not order again would be the \"Arogosta\" - gnocchi with rock lobster tail, scallops, mussels and cherry tomato in a porcini aglio e olio. This was the first pasta dish from Ferro that I did not enjoy...  Mainly because we all thought the Gnocchi would be \"pillowy\" and the cherry tomatoes were too tart -- it just wasn't a harmonious dish.  Overall, it's still a great restaurant and there's lots of great items to choose from. You could say that it's been one of my \"go-to\" restaurants when friends or family crave Italian.  Some of my all time favourites to share with friends or family are:   Apps:  Magic Mushrooms, Calamari Alla Grigilia Mains:  Piatto Di Pesce for 1 with a few pastas (family style), such as Vongole and Cappellini  Note:  I have heard from my friends that the pizzas, sandwiches, other mains or specials of the day are also good; but I usually prefer to have the dishes listed above.  1 star removed for the pasta dish... otherwise 4.5 stars due to it's consistency each year."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Pastas are fresh and tasty. Magic mash rooms are to die for. Try a seasonal item on menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place-has been a neighborhood go-to for years for me. Prices not cheap but reasonable for the portions. Magic mushroom appy (think assorted mushrooms in a garlic/cheese sauce on crostini) are to die for. Lots of good pastas and their pizzas are actually delish-thin, chewy crust and varied, great toppings. Several good salads although I wish they'd bring back the original \"Ferro\" salad. Reasonable wine options. Can be loud on a busy evening. Tiny but pleasant front patio. Staff are almost always great or at least pleasant. Worth a visit, especially if you live nearby."}
{"text":"A funky little Italian place. Awesome food and great wine with weird and wonderful decor. It's a dark cozy little nook that's perfect for one on ones."}
{"text":"Great place to go for real italian cuisine. They specialize in pizzas and the calamari was exactly like my family's homemade recipe. It was impressive. Nice ambience, and everything we had was very fresh and delicious. Do not have risotto here, it's not one of their specialties."}
{"text":"We love Ferro! Always fresh and clean.  The salmon dish is my favorite.  We are there at least once a month great food and service!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in Toronto.  The pizzas are terrific. The salmon is prepared perfectly. I've brought out of town guests to it and they just raved about it.  As for prices, they are consistent with other Toronto restaurants but here the portions are very generous.   The ambiance is fun and hip without any pretentiousness. A definite winner in my book."}
{"text":"Superb Italian food meets cool, funky decor and a relatively hip clientele at Ferro Bar and Cafe on St. Clair Ave. West. Exposed brick, wrought iron decor and a bar with a ceiling so cool I couldn't stop staring.   Come here for the food. The rest is just gravy. Mushrooms garnished with a garlic cream sauce (the 'magic mushrooms' really are magical) , a selection of antipasta, fresh fish that melts in your mouth. Recommend the Pizza Verdura (if you like goat cheese), the minestrone soup (super fresh and healthy) and filetto rosso (mouth-watering Atlantic salmon with a sweet red pepper sauce).   Service wasn't great but does it really matter?  Relaxing, trendy and all around amazing. Wish I'd had expandable pants."}
{"text":"I am in the restaurant as I write this review - prices are not as advertised on the menu. I was overcharged on my drink orders. I was also charged $1.25 extra for having half the pizza without sausage. So essentially I'm paying more... for less? Also... no apology for the mistake. 1/5."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city!  I normally come with my friends and family 1-3 times per month and the food is always great, especially the mussels and eggplant parmesan. They have an amazing selection of wine and the ambiance is stylish and cool.  The staff are also very attentive and overall, this restaurant makes you feel at home.  I'll be coming to Ferro forever!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought me to Ferro a few years ago for lunch and I've been coming back ever since. The iron work decor inside the restaurant is just lovely and the atmosphere is great for grabbing a bite or a latte with a friend or for celebrating your birthday with family.  Admittedly, the prices aren't exactly 'bargain basement' but the atmosphere and food quality make up for it. They've got this \"to-die-for\" magic mushroom crostini appetizer. --mouth watering as I write this. Ferro is one of my favs."}
{"text":"Pizza was great, but apps burnt black. How TF does the kitchen let that go out. Very poor service.  Caesar salad ok. not special. The burnt apps really show someone does not care...  I will never eat in again"}
{"text":"The end point of my review of this place is that everything is mediocre. Nothing spectacular, but worth a try because it's not actually too disappointing. Perhaps you'll have a better experience.   Now for the details. This place is super loud. Mind you: I have good hearing and don't necessarily mind a noisy atmosphere. The background music was just pumped up way too high, which meant the patrons around us had to speak loudly, which meant my dining partner and I couldn't hear our own conversation. We had to either yell or perform makeshift sign language.   For the food, it was a bit of a hit-and-miss. We ordered the Magic Mushrooms appetizer, which we both thought was delicious. This might have raised our expectations a bit higher for the mains. I had the Spaghetti Special with Meatballs, while my friend ordered the Risotto Special with Asparagus. He summed up the taste of the risotto as \"slightly weird\" as the flavours didn't quite work together and it was way too salty. My entree was a bit bland. The sauce didn't have too much taste to it, and the meatballs were slightly on the dry side. Perhaps we should've ordered their pizza, as this seemed to be their must-try item. We ended our meal with Tiramisu, which was good but not incredible. It seemed as if it wasn't dipped in the coffee long enough, so it lacked some depth of flavour.   Also, as mentioned in other people's reviews, the service here was not up to par. Slower-than-crawling pace and not attentive.   All in all, I would say try it just to say you've tried it. But if you have other Italian restaurants in mind, then save your budget for something better."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has been around for years and the food has always been great. There is a ton of choice - tons of different kinds of pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, and more, and all of the servings are quite large for the price. The dipping sauce that comes out with the bread is heaven - olive oil, balsamic vinegar, parmesan, and some sort of spicy oil. I could eat it for an entire meal.   It's packed a little tight sometimes (doesn't have the most comfortable furniture in the world) and sometimes it can be a bit too loud when they have the TVs on and the place is really full, but on the whole it is almost always a pleasant experience. They've owned the building next door and have been planning an expansion for years, and I cannot wait for it to happen - a bit more space would be great. And maybe they'll be able to bring back the pool tables, which they sadly got rid of about 10 years ago to make space for more tables.  Either way, it is a great spot if you want a casual, tasty meal."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and I absolutely love it. My boyfriend and I stumbled on to this place a couple of years ago and recently went back to see if it stood up to our memory. It did.   The staff were so helpful on the phone, taking reservations and accommodating us even though they were busy. They also have a great wine knowledge and selection.   The decor is interesting, consistent, original, and pleasant. And most importantly, the food is just marvelous, with a varied selection and large portions which hold up when reheated as leftovers. The lobster linguine is divine. I wish I lived nearby so I could pop in for a bit of pizza or white wine on the patio whenever I felt the itch."}
{"text":"AMAZING absolutely love the food. One of the best on St.Clair. Cool vibe, loud, but great music and atmosphere. Great friendly staff. Affordable and great drinks.   Must try: Pollo salad, magic mushrooms, seafood pastas and all of the pizzas are really tasty! Iano pizza is delicious.   Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yes, the staff is pretentious. Yes, it is not the friendliest place. But! The food here is so fucking good, I keep going back. Easily my favourite restaurant. Damn you, food, for being so good. They must have ninja magician cooks or something. Just ignore the jersey shore managers and you will have the best meal of your life."}
{"text":"Sat in gum. They did  NOT care.  Said, \"if you sat in gum at the park, would  you  ask the  city to pay for  your  pants?\" I said, \"a park  is outside. You are responsible  for what  happens  in your  restaurant.  Im being fare, my pants are $30+tax\". We were here for New Years. Food was more expensive  than usual. It was horrible m I had been  here many  times  before and it was good. Tonight was expensive  crap. I'm  done  with this place  as the ignorance  was overwhelming  and the lack of customer service was apparent!! Will NEVER  visit here  again and will continue to spread the negative word. Dom,  you're  a peice of sh*t."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting a friend and decided to hit st Clair street and find a foodie gem! Not really known, however we ended up stopping in a ferros  which is an Italian style resto.  I can say I was impressed with the arrival and decor and can see why it would be a hit with the locals. I chose to sit at the bar which is covered in  different stainless steel designs. Awesome feature to an extremely cosy athompehere.   We chose to have the red wine on tap which was from the \"Niagara\" region  4 or 6oz servings... however when we got the bill we were informed differently from the menu and only 4oz serving... (don't let this detour you wine prices flex all the time)  We order an sample cheese/meat platter which was fantastic and i swear had the best blue cheese known to man... something from nothern Italy but amazing!   Menu is extensive and one thing I did notice was the abundance of pizza deliveries leaving. Maybe this is a great indication for a hidden gem for a great wheel!  Over all design and decor are great, open  kitchen  design and a see through from back to from of establishment.  Pros - Decor/Friendliness of staff  Cons - Kids at the bar (8pm) on tablets, I didn't think this was sorta of correct given price of foods etc. (Kids are our future but I don't think they belong in this area)  Tip - Doors sorta tough to find."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous,  the service was excellent and the company was exceptional.   Couldn't have asked for a better dinner."}
{"text":"WHAT?! Only 22 reviews for this place? Actually I'm kind of glad, as I would hate to show up and have to deal with a line up! Ferro is not a hard place to miss, except in the summer when people and music spill out onto the sidewalk, causing one to wonder what is going on.   Ditto to Cam D.'s review of Ferro. I like everything about this place and it is definitely one of the better (if not the best) restaurants along this stretch of St. Clair. The music, the laid-back atmosphere, and the SMELLS coming from the open kitchen!!! OMG...I have never been disappointed the times I've dined here and I LOVE that it's not far from home. They make great pastas and pizze, and their specials are amazing!!  My friend and I were there on Friday. We got the last table and this was at about 7pm. We were a little tight on time but babbled over a few drinks anyway as we had tons to catch up on. We ended up sharing the zucca insalata which contained huge chunks of roasted squash (MMMMM!), goat cheese, candied pecans, etc.; and both ordered pizze with meat and mushrooms: Campania and Domenico (very meaty with mushrooms). Both good, thin crust pizze cooked just right. While we ate, I noticed the couple next to us having black cod and it looked divine! I asked the waiter where the black cod was on the menu as I would have ordered that but it turns out we showed up and ordered just before the daily specials menu was released. Geez, I wish we had waited!!   I've had their pastas, pizze, and risotto and EVERYTHING was delicious. Service is always polite and fast. It's funny but it actually kind of reminds me of Insomnia for some reason--similar vibe: dark interior, the music, the people (but not so much)..? If you've never tried Ferro, you should. It's worth the price and the quality of food and ingredients is very good, and I love that they don't skimp."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to watch other people enjoy their food. After 1 hour and 50 minute wait for our mains we left to eat somewhere else.  The table who was sat after us seemed to enjoy the dishes we ordered immensely."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Beautiful &elegant decor, great staff but most of all the food is ridiculously fantastic. We were able to meet both Chef Charles and the sommelier Michael; such wonderful, sweet guys. Chef Charles came to our table several times to check on us and Michael ensured that we were happy and satisfied. Our server Daniella was very attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered the Magic Mushrooms, pizza with prosciutto, the Charles sandwich, kale Cesar salad, mushroom papperdelle and Nutella calzone. Everything was amazing but I have to say my favorites were the magic mushrooms and papperdelle. We had such a marvelous experience and will definitely come back. Check them out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"A new favourite!  We have a tradition where we take our twin niece and nephew out for their birthday to a restaurant that we haven't tried before.  This year, we thought we'd give Ferro a go and we're so glad that we did.  It was a fantastic night! The only regret is that the menu was so appetizing that we couldn't help ourselves and ate a bit too much, but every single bite was worth it.  The Kale Ceaser salad was exceptional.  My husband and I were the only ones to order it, but our 15-year-old niece and nephew jumped at the chance to share some with us.  Yes. Teenagers jumping at the chance to eat some salad.  That alone is impressive.  Then we shared the Trio appetizer along with the grilled calamari. The Magic Mushrooms from the Trio and the calamari were incredible.  We didn't leave any scraps behind and wondered how we were going to finish our entrees when they arrived.   Our niece enjoyed the Gnocchi with tomato sauce and I had it with the gorgonzola sauce. Somehow, because these were so delicious, we managed to eat all of it despite our previous appetizers, and I now have a new obsession.  I will definitely return for that gorgonzola gnocchi. In fact, I may have to go back again tonight.    My husband had the veal parmigiana; he tells me that it was veally great!    Our nephew had the Margherita pizza and saved some purposely so he could enjoy some again the next day on his actual birthday.  All in all, it was a fantastic evening and we're looking like a rock star Aunt and Uncle.  Thanks so much to the staff at Ferro for wonderful service and a memorable night.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was here the other night with hubby and son.  They ordered the piatto to di pesce, which they really enjoyed. I had my regular (been there three times) of pizza Margarita. Not good at all. Hardly any fior di latte mozzarella, just dabs of it. Loved it the other two times! This time, boring, all sauce. I was really looking forward to that pizza, too! Also, sent back some wine my son ordered."}
{"text":"A neighborhood secret and amazing gem tucked away near Corso Italia. While many would claim Terroni is the best of the best in Italian joints; my vote is for Ferro. I prefer the authentic southern cuisine; fresh selections of fish and seafood matched with velvety sauces.   I've never had anything on the menu that wasn't delicious. The wine selection is excellent, and the set menu takes the guess work out of pairings.   A perfect place to graze and drink on a beautiful summer evening with friends or co-workers or a special someone."}
{"text":"I find the decor tacky, but that's subjective of course.  Pricey salad was tiny, margherita tomato sauce was disappointing for a place that specializes in Neapolitan style pizzas. This is one of the best towns in the world outside of Naples for margheritas, so there's no reason to ever get one at this spot."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious dishes, including the magic mushrooms; the fusilli was scrumptious, but I had some dinner envy going on after observing my friend's Black Angus steak plate. Was also introduced to a tasty Vodka Aranciata (vodka and orange San Pellegrino), which made everything go down - and time pass - very easily."}
{"text":"It was crazy-busy when we arrived so we had to wait for a table.  But once we were seated, it was worth the wait.  For apps, I had the magic mushrooms and they were a little difficult to eat but very tasty.  But main was magnificent.  It was a linguine dish with a lobster tail, scallops, and veggies and it was perhaps the finest pasta dish I've had.  The service was surprisingly quite well organized even though it was insanely busy.  And the servers were pleasant to interact with which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Ferro. Lunch with a friend. We split a very nice pizza, prosciutto and arugula. Main courses seared Tilapia with oyster mushrooms $16:00 and veal scaloppine with rosemary white wine sauce $17:00. Tasty and satisfying. Great lunch spot, gets crowded in the evening."}
{"text":"I was here with friends over the long weekend and we were worried that it might be too crowded  to get a table but we were seated immediately upon arriving. Our waiter was very friendly, he recommended some drinks to our group and the service was quicker than I thought it would be. Our table ordered the magic mushrooms to share and wow were they ever worth it. I had my reservations about mushrooms on crostini but the garlic cream sauce is to die for (possibly the best part of a great meal). I also ordered the pappardelle with mushrooms as a main which was very good as well although I like my pasta al dente and this was very al dente even for me. I have a sneaking suspicion that someone forgot to stir the pasta or something similar because bits of it were actually quite firm and stuck together. Otherwise a very tasty dish! It's a somewhat small place but the decor is cool. Also a little on the pricey side if you are getting drinks (and tip is automatically 17%!) but they definitely have cheaper options if you go for something like a basic margherita pizza. Would definitely go back to try more of the delicious sounding items on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! 4 people with different appetites, all were happy with what they had. My little son have almost finished half of my pasta and takes his whole pizza home!!! We will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Feeling some Italian, my friend and I stopped in at Ferro on a busy night not too long ago.  First to note is the decor. Just wonderful. The ceiling painting is so old-school looking, it's great.  We were seated near the back of the place, and waited for a little bit for someone to come by, but nobody did...until a waitress came to re-seat us to the front of the restaurant, as they were closing the back section for the evening. What the hell? Anyway.  The spot where we were re-seated bugged me. It was right next to the bar, and some sort of game was on, and that area was way too noisey. That would be my only real complaint about Ferro. Most of the restaurant wants to be a nice and relaxing Italian restaurant, and the one corner wants desperately to be a noisy sports bar.  Once we got the ball rolling with our orders, things got better. Though the waitress came by very rarely, and often long after our glasses were empty, we got what we ordered, and she was pretty friendly.  The food itself was great. We ordered one of their specialty pizzas, and the seafood platter to pick away at. No complaints whatsoever in this department.  Overall, mostly a great atmosphere, and great food. Loses points for the crappy \"Sports Bar Section\", and not-as-great-as-the-food service. I'd return."}
{"text":"Place was packed on a Sunday and we had a big group... Result: 1 hour wait. Place has a funky local vibe, bones look very much like the pool hall it used to be. Totally worth a wait- the 2 owners made sure libations were provided -all Ontario craft beers- while we hovered and then, the food! The Magic Mushrooms were just that and the Saltimbocca was the best veal dish I have ever had. Son had the Domenico pizza and raved. Great service, felt like we were family."}
{"text":"This is one of our usual haunts. We go here when we're feeling pizza and pasta. I've enjoyed everything I've had here, from the apps to the pastas on the menu and whatever their special of the day is. Once it was rabbit ragu and I was in LOVE.   The place gets pretty busy and crowded, but it's a nice spot for dinner, and the value is quite good."}
{"text":"So i had bookmarked this place and promised myself id go like 8 times & try everything on their menu cause man do I love me some Italian food.   Tonight was my first time there .. lets start   LET ME TELL YOU. The BEST decision in my food life, was choosing the magic mushrooms for the appetizer . They are an orgasmic MUST.  & i will no doubt order that every time I come.   I got the fusilli as the main , realllly good,  & I love my food well salted but it was a tad too salty for me. My friend ordered the Calabrese and she loved it.  (Photos will be posted in a minute)    The service was alright, very friendly but had to wait a while for the bill & then to pay the bill..   The place is a bit loud but overall a cute and great place for a date or with friends  Table next to us got the pizzas and they were pretty big and yum  WILL BE BACK asap to try everything else"}
{"text":"Went to Ferro's again in the first part of June 2010.  I've been eating here off and on for the past 10 years and introducing various people to this place.  So it was to my profound disappointment that the regular Capellini pasta, tiger shrimps, and mussels had changed.  My problem was with the \"off\" tasting shrimps.  Shrimps should never taste anything but delicious.  I asked the cook/part owner (who I've seen for years) why not only one, but three of the six jumbo's tasted like that.  His answer was that they stopped grilling them a few months back, but he would hook me up and grill them.  Fast forward, and now I have a skewer of five \"new\" grilled shrimp, this time two of which taste off!  This sort of thing really ticks me off.  The customer is always right, and in this case they had bought a batch of bad shrimp.  To finalize matters, all my mussels tasted fine until I got to the last one.  It had that vile taste that everyone who has ever eaten a bad mussel will know.  It wasn't like it was even closed, and it left me disgusted beyond words.   Ferro's you should have taken that dish off the bill, but I didn't press matters, because like I said I had been going there for years.  However, as it stands, they won't be seeing me for a while."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food, dimly lit space, OK service, and fairly crowded on most nights. What's missing? More attentive service, creative inspiration for the menu (standard ingredients on oven-burning pizzas, pastas, and salads), and get rid of those TVs! I was enjoying a candle-lit dinner at a corner table by the window and all I could see was a boxing match glaring on the big screen while club-type music was blasting in the background. Total mismatch! The space has great potential for this neighborhood (whose other upscale-casual restaurants are a bit stuffy) and it is well-decorated but the TVs have got to go and they need a new DJ."}
{"text":"*2.5*  I used to love this place, and it saddens me to have to write a semi-poor review.   They do have good pastas and pizzas, once they had a \"Seafood Pizza\" which was on a special menu, that was absolutely incredible.  Now as for my recent negative experience. We were there for a friends birthday, and my sister ordered a pizza with Gorgonzola cheese. Once the pizza arrived at the table, a gross smelling odour filled the air. Hesitant to even take a bite of her pizza, she finally did, and believe it or not the pizza tasted as foul as it smelled.   She called the waiter over, and explained the situation, and his response was \"that's how Gorgonzola cheese smells.\" Clearly this is no proper way to handle a situation of the sort. When she asked to speak to the manager (who I believe is also the owner) he pretty much had the same response and did not offer to swap the pizza for another one. Unacceptable.  Luckily amongst the 5 of us, there was plenty of pizza and pasta to go around, but this experience has left me outraged. The pizza sat at the table for the duration of the meal, without anyone touching it. No compensation offered.  Not gonna lie, in time I will probably return since the food is really good, and it's a fun spot to eat at. But a brush up on proper customer service is definitely needed here."}
{"text":"Let me first start off saying that maybe this was too authentic for me, now onto the review.   The place was cool and super hip, but fit well in the neighborhood. The staff was friendly and the service was great! Our server greeted us promptly and checked on us regularly. I got bruschetta with goat cheese and I loved it as an appetizer but the got the veal Parmesan as an entree and it just tasted off to me. I ate half of it and was done...like I said, maybe it was too authentic for me.  Overall, I like this place and will definitely give them another try next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My party of five loved everything. We had three different pizzas, all delicious. The gnocchi in pesto were delicious. The veal was perfect and the butternut squash side was amazing.  Service was fast and very friendly. It has a hip ambience and a good mix of music that was just the right volume so you could have a conversation."}
{"text":"The food was good but very poor service. We felt extremely rushed and while they were clearing our table the server spilled my glass of wine. They didn't even offer me another glass of wine and still charged me for the wine that I didn't get a chance to drink. Can you imagine! We spoke to the manager and we didn't feel like desert but they  still brought us random desert that we didn't even get to choose. All they needed to do is refund/comp at least my glass of wine. So beware of your drinks. Make sure they don't spill it. Of course this got reflected on the tip."}
{"text":"Was not feeling the greatest, but my man companion had convinced me to accompany him for an evening at a restaurant of his choice. To my delight, it was Ferro. I immediately felt welcomed by Mike who suggested we sit at the bar until a table became available. During our time there, I felt comforted by the warm ambiance which consisted not only of friendly patrons but also the personable bar matron. (Not to mention, the kitchen crew hard at work in the open concept designed kitchen, which always adds a more welcoming air.) She inquired as to whether we were eating, we mentioned that a table was being readied for us but we were happy to settle with her prior to moving. I had a pint of Beau's, my partner opted for a delicious Grolsch which isn't as commonly seen on draught.   We sat at a cozy table by the front window, yes it was a chilly evening but I dress like a Canadian woman so temperature isn't an issue for this gal. Flowers in an old bottle, and a candle at our high top made it a nice setting. Not too romantic, just perfect was the atmospheric dub influenced music playing over the speakers at a perfect volume.   We enjoyed the crostini trio, which is a nice sharing option for a deuce. Oyster and portobello mushroom mix, bruschetta, and a white bean bruschetta (weekly crustini special). The bread wasn't too crusty, perfectly sliced, soft where it should've been and drizzled just so. Nice. I'm big on bruschetta and it was perfect.   Since I'm a twig and eat when I'm forced to, we shared a hearty garden salad and the NY strip with peppercorn jus and Asparagus (it's not June, let's be honest they aren't local) and rosemary seasoned potatoes. I normally only eat rib-eye, but they managed to cook this med rare strip and keep it marbelled like I spent 25 bones at the butcher.   After some complimentary calzone for dessert, I was left feeling satisfied. Wait and support staff were pleasant, and I look forward to coming back and entertaining friends while trying out the rest of the menu over the holiday season. Might I add, it was busy the entire time we were there (over 2 hours) so it's apparent the atmosphere and food was thoroughly enjoyed by others as well."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood go-to spot. Funky decor and always packed, which can be a bit dark and noisy, but there is always great energy!    I have done date nights and big groups and the place is great for both.   The entire menu is delicious and well executed. You will find something for everyone. Reasonable wine list as well. I recommend family style so you can taste a few items. The portions are extra generous, so don't over order.  Looking forward to see how they expand in to the new space..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant, calzone is absolutely fantastic pizza's are outstanding musclesAre delicious great wine selection Justin over all great restaurant can't say I didn't know about this place best restaurant on Saint Clair"}
{"text":"The food is great - we used to go here all the time for \"date night\" when we lived on the west side.  The service was slow - they seemed VERY understaffed. Not just slow, but a little on the lippy side too, which drives me crazy. SERVICE industry.  They don't take reservations, and there is a raging/aging hipster vibe. Very loud, though you'll recognize all the music.  All in all, it's just a bit weird. Something just doesn't jive.  Food is good but doesn't seem to match the spot, tone/feel of the resto or the attitude of the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Fabulous place - family run.  Food was amazing. Specials look good but we opted for menu items.  Service great.  Varied wine selection.  Loved the ambiance and food.  Will go back."}
{"text":"As I continue on my quest for authentic Italian pizza while balancing my carb intake we found ourselves at ferro (translation iron). The space was nice but a little cramped and the noise level was not average... It was loud. The wine was good and they had Italian soft drinks and tartufo!! All good things. The pizza was good but everything was quite salty both the crust and ingredients. The service by our main waiter was meh :( and I suspect it was because he was the only one taking orders but the girls were all very helpful, friendly and efficient. It was over all ok but we will likely go somewhere else for our next pizza outing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian restaurant in the city. The food never disappoints. It's consistently the best food and the one place I sit back, close my eyes and savour the flavours at Ferro.   Apps you need to order: - Magic Mushrooms: get ready to die and go to heaven. This dish is the absolute bomb. I genuinely get a foodgasm when I have this. I also don't like to share my magic mushroom.  - Carpaccio: so thin, tender and delicious. The flavour complemented by fresh sliced parmigiano reggiano. This dish is incredible.  - Cozze: love their mussels and prefer them with the white wine sauce.   Salads: their salads are insanely delicious, I love the Zucca salad with a grilled salmon on top. Their salmon is tender and delicate.   All their pizzas, pastas, gnocchi's and risottos are cooked to perfection and enhanced with the finest ingredients. The quality of everything here is beyond excellent. In my opinion, their pizzas are the best in the city.   Dessert: You MUST have the tiramisu!!!! Omg, it straight out of a Nonna's kitchen in Italy.  If you haven't been, go, right now. Stop reading this review and go already!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber eats. Everything was perfect. A+ and I don't say that often. Order: 1) Bruschetta on goat cheese crostini 2) light butternut squash cream ravioli 3) Salmone alla grigilia with light risotto and sautéed roasted veggies   Everyone loved the ravioli, someone remarked that the Bruschetta was one of the best they ever tasted and I selfishly kept the fish entrée all to myself. Was very impressed with the food and raving to all my friends about it today (they must hate having a foodie as a friend... I feel bad for them lol but at least they will know where to find great food!)   Enjoy!   FYI they have other great looking menu items like paninis, risotto, and wood-oven baked pizzas with cheeky names such as \"Wha' Guan' lol"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for YEARS! I currently studying in Florida, but every time I am home I always visit Ferro. Their quality of food is amazing and always on point. Staff is always super friendly. I recommend the magic mushrooms(which we get 8 each time) and also their lobster linguine."}
{"text":"This my Nth time having dinner at this restaurant and tonight, it happened to be me & my friend's birthday. We have the worse experience! We told her that we are celebrating our bdays and we want a cake for our dessert and asked her to provide a candle if possible. She said yes but with a straight face. Service was slow and it was sunday evening and not busy at all. We have to ask her for our iced tea 3x..until we finished our meal, ordered for our desserts. They served us 3 cakes but no bday candle and it took her awhile to realized that we were waiting for the candle as we expect since they said/yes when we asked her beforehand. Bill was served and she asked us if everything is ok, as soon as my friend is about to answer she took off. She knows she did not received a good tip which actually is overpriced and automatically charged you in the machine freaking 17% TIP! Overpriced for a not-that-special restaurant. We left and she saw us coming through from behind her and she never greeted us goodbye or good evening. Good food but BAD SERVICE!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night and really enjoyed the food. Unlike some Italian restaurants where the portions are tiny, Ferro offered good portions leaving you satisfied at the end of your meal. They offered a big menu with many excellent choices. Even the bruschetta was deliciously toasted with goat cheese. I would recommend the Seafood Spaghettini and the Zucca insalata also. A tomato-y pasta with good portion of seafood and a light tasting salad with butter squash and candied pecans.  Now comes the reason why I did not give it a 5 star rating. The service was good but that's it. Nothing over the top, no WoW factor. When we got there, the restaurant was freezing cold because the heat wasn't on. After sitting down for about 10-15 minutes, our server finally noticed us shivering at our table with our jackets still on and turned the heat on for us. Some of the utensils we got were stained with hard food and had to be sent back. The food and drinks didn't arrive at the same time. We had to wait on drinks before doing a toast. Then the worst part of the night was when this family of 20 was being extremely loud and obnoxious the entire night. Their kids were banging on the table with knives and forks for a good 30 mins then followed by screams and surprisingly none of the adults or their parents said a word to their kids. Let's just say it was not the most pleasant experience.   All I can say is that the food here was good."}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday night for my birthday. It was a different atmosphere than the other two times I was there.  This time the place was quite. The service was lousy. The waiter never brought the beer we ordered. At the end of the meal the waiter spilled food on my friends sweater. Didn't offer to pay for cleaning.  It was an awful birthday dinner. Afraid to go back"}
{"text":"I was there for drinks only, the food on the other tables looked good but there is no ventilation, your hair and clothes will smell like a deep frier for a long time. Great atmosphere but just cannot handle the smell. Music was a bit too loud too."}
{"text":"I went to Ferro for the first time in many years last evening.  It was great.  My friend and I had a lovely & casual dinner - highly recommend the kale Caesar and the calamari.    Our waiter (a tall guy with glasses - sorry I forget his name!) was really nice, attentive and friendly.    There was a technical issue when we were checking out with their credit/debit machine which held us up for a while (damn technology!) which then led to another little issue.  However, the waiter and management were very patient and gracious.  Thank you very much - you guys are awesome!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great veggie pizza! Tried the Root of all Evil drink...  Ooooo haa! That's potent! Wonderful atmosphere & service."}
{"text":"Who wants some really tasty pizza? This is the spot. I love going here because it's easy to get to in the middle of the city. The service is pretty good but this restaurant is always busy and it can get very loud. Try the pizza and get a quick drink while you're there!"}
{"text":"3.5* here folks.  If you got money, 4* without a doubt.  The food is great.  It's a lovely place.  I'd go back.   But it's going to cost you.  Keep that in mind.  But if you find yourself on a steak budget, rather than a McDouble budget, you're good to go here.  they put the food on these little wood trays.  So cute.  And the mushrooms on the bread?  That's good.  The steak?  Not too bad!  Ultimately this was a really good experience.  I don't know enough about the fancy stuff we had to go into too much detail - but boy was I pleased to eat here, and I'll totally have to go back."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a group of nine, and we were given a nice large table in the back half where we had ample space. The atmosphere was amazing, from the decor to the music, to the groovy skylight.  I wish I could say the same about the food, but almost everyone in our party had the same reaction when I asked them at the end how their meal was: \"meh\". We ordered a variety of dishes including pizzas, risotto, gnocchi, pasta, etc. so I doubt we didn't order the \"right\" food. Nobody had any real complaints per se, but for the price, I would have expected something a little more memorable. Given the abundance of restaurants in the area, I can't see myself returning here, as I'd sooner try another place."}
{"text":"A common, bistro styled place that serves Italian inspired food and drink. The veal dishes were excellent and I enjoyed the tomato salad appetizer. The ambiance is good and quite lively. The service was impeccable and very genuine. The server had good knowledge of the menu and had a nice sense of humor. The wine list by the glass looked a bit skimpy, but we tried a decent Malbec.   Ferro is A-OK in my books.  P.S. The portions are quite large, so have a good sized appetite! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant, which probably hit its peak of popularity in the early part of this millenium, is just plain good.  Despite its days gone by kind of feel, Ferro is one of my middle of the week faves. This Italian restaurant serves up unadorned, down to earth, Italian food. The staff is extremely friendly and the service is great.  The MUST HAVES on the menu are the Magic Mushrooms, Seafood Platter, and the Minestrone soup, but everything is great."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Ferro.  We were impressed the last time and it's so nice and close.  This time we were going to celebrate our anniversary and, so, the stakes were higher.  The atmosphere is awesome.  This time, we sat nearer the back.  Last time, we were on the patio.  Not really an option in November.  I mean, I like the winter more than the next guy, but it's not going to happen.  It was great to just be there.    On to the food.  I just noticed a previous reviewer mentioned the mushroom crostini.  We didn't have it this time, but we did last time.  Wow!  This time, we shared the carpaccio.  It was so good.  The flavours were balanced really well and it was so tasty.  As an appetiser, I would recommend sharing, since you might not fit dinner in afterward, unless you happen to be famished.  I had the  rigatoni Bolognese, which blew my mind.  It was such a simple dish, yet it was, dare I say it, perfect.  My wife had lobster linguine with scallops, snow peas & red pepper.  She adored it.  I tried it.  It was really good, but I was not in a seafood mood that night.  If I were, I would have loved it.  She made them take the calamari out though.  That would have made it even better.  On to dessert.  When we had the pleasure of visiting Italy last year for our anniversary, we went on a search for the best tiramisu.  Venice won.  The tiramisu we had at Ferro did not quite measure up to that, but, come on, we're talking Venice here.  I digress.  This tiramisu was as good as any we had anywhere else in Italy though.    Price-wise, think you are going to have a remarkable meal with a real Italian flavour and then try not to look at the bill.  Seriously, it is not really a bargain basement night out, but it is totally worth it.  It also won't break the bank either.  Did I mention it was worth it? So completely and entirely worth it?  Ferro may end up being economical enough to be your neighbourhood hangout, but you will sure wish it could be."}
{"text":"Went to Ferro with girlfriends over the holidays.  Made a reservation for 5, didn't care for our table right beside the kitchen but they moved us by the front perfect.  However while waiting at the door to be seated we waited several minutes fine, but several servers saw us and ignored us.  I get its busy but acknowledging the customers is their first priority.  Our server seemed a little rattled at first but she was busy and I've been there but after that smooth sailing.  Drinks, wine, appies, mains were all good.  I do have to mention though other reviewers raved about the magic mushroom appie and ours was very chewy and was hard to bite through without eating it in a large gulp so there was that.  Moving on, our water was always filled without asking which is great and we really enjoyed the fun atmosphere.    Not sure if he was the owner or manager but he took our reservation on the phone and came over to us and brought yummy shots on the house and was super nice.  I would definitely recommend Ferro and will be back for sure! Thanks!"}
{"text":"A pretty average place in my opinion. Not amazing but not horrible. We ordered a few drinks, a kale salad, and two pizzas. The salad was tasty, but in all honesty, when has a kale caesar salad ever been a disappointment. It's a pretty tough salad to mess up. Our pizzas, a mushroom white pizza and a spicy sausage pizza were good, but really nothing special. I would rate a bunch of other pizzas I've had in the city above these. The service was pretty horrible, but I'm not going to bash the servers too hard because it was hard to tell if they were absent because they lacked care or because the restaurant was understaffed on a Tuesday evening. The female server never showed up to take our order (manager had to tend to us) and she really only showed up to fill water and deliver us our food. I probably won't be back only because there are better options in this city filled with an abundance of Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"Cute little place with kind of a 90's feel. (As I write this I don't even know what that means...but that's how I'm going to describe it anyways).  I've been here as part of a larger group (bday party) and with a few girl friends for dinner/drinks. They have a very small front patio with only 3 tables, but very nice if you can get a seat!  They have a few decent veg options. And they do their pasta just right - al dente, yes! But it sometimes pains me to pay $17+ for noodles and vegetables when I know I can do this for much less myself.  But I remind myself, I go for the whole experience, right??  But I think the KEY to enjoying this place (as I have witnessed a few others do this) is to share dishes among friends, split an antipasti,  pasta and pizza.   FYI some of the anitpastis are very generous in size and could easily fill you up."}
{"text":"Lovely food and friend Great wine compliments it well  Service also great!  Review in Haiku I  am trying something new Hope you enjoy it"}
{"text":"holy shit. i ordered in ubereats and it was delicious, so i can't even imagine how good it is in restaurant. i ordered the magic mushrooms (omg!!!!) and salmon on salad.   mushrooms are like my favourite food and the magic mushrooms are probably one of the best mushroom based dishes i have ever had. the garlic cream sauce is like crack.   i am not really a salad person and the salad was.... wonderful. beets, goat cheese, pistachios, arugula, in a light dressing. mmmm. the salmon was perfectly cooked and had a nice crispy exterior.   can't wait to visit the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ferro is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The Magic Mushrooms are amazing and the antipasto plate is delicious.  Sometimes the staff gets distracted by their \"coolness\" but worth it for the generally good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"This place has the right formula for keeping the crowds coming back. They serve simple, reliable food in a cozy atmosphere.   The Salumi Misti ($17) is very nice and generous.  The Rustica Salad with chicken added ($17) is nice, even if the chicken is a little dry.  The Brasato Risotto with braised beef is pretty good and is quite a generous portion for $18.50.  The Veal Scallopini in lemon sauce is a little tough and somewhat disappointing.  The Paitto Di Pesce (seafood platter) is quite good and generous  reasonably priced at $38.50 for two.  Service is good and the vibe is nice.  The restaurant is busy even on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Just after we got there the obviously new waiter went to put some food on our table that wasn't ours. The other waiter (possibly owner?) berated him right in from of us for not knowing the table numbers, which we thought was a little rude, nobody is perfect when they start. But if you are going to berate someone else publicly,  at least be good at your own job! The waiter/owner spent so long watching this new waiter, he forgot to put our starter order through, and messed up our main orders. He blamed the kitchen for messing up, but clearly he was preoccupied with bugging the new guy that he i quite a piss poor job if serving himself!  Food was ok. Nice enough, but not to die for. Atmosphere was quite nice.  I would go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Ferro is that one place in the neighbourhood we've been saying we should try since we moved in 5 years ago, but never actually did.   After a Valentine's dinner at the restaurant across the street last Friday we thought we'd finally head across the street and check it out for some drinks.  The place was bustling when we walked in and everyone seemed friendly and comfortable. We sat at the bar and got the vibe that most of the others along the bar were regulars. I ordered an old fashioned and my girlfriend ordered a manhattan and to our surprise, the bartenders had the ingrediants knew how to make them--and how to make them well (not always a given at bars along St. Clair).  We had a great time and definitely will be back to try the dinner offerings."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines Day....it was delicious. Great ambiance, great food.Got the recommendation from TripAdvisor and it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend was also excited because he was able to watch the All Star Dunk contest on one of their 2 TVs by the front/bar area.   Appetizer: YOU MUST ORDER THE MAGIC MUSHROOMS! Yum x 1,000,009  Entry: I had the halibut (daily special) and I ate it too I wanted to explode it was delicious.   My boyfriend had one of the pizzas and really liked it.   Dessert: Flourless Chocolate Cake .... amazing. Not too rich, was able to enjoy all of it.    Criticism: Maybe figure out the door situation so it isn't so cold.   Otherwise, this is a great date location. Awesome food, with the option to sit by a TV if you want to watch a sporting event, or have that as a backup for conversation."}
{"text":"We Just had dinner at Ferro bar & cafe.  Have been coming for dinner for many years. The noise level was as usual. Very loud. The food consistently good and portions generous.  What was missing was a friendly happy ambience.  The wait staff was quite unsmiling and morose looking. No eye contact or smiles. I don't need to make friends with the staff but I do like to feel welcome."}
{"text":"I've been here now three or four times, the service is always outstanding. The food is hit or miss, on our latest visit we found our pastas a bit on the salty side. Although we have seen amazing looking food on other tables so we might be ordering wrong.  The magic mushrooms (some sort of delicious cream sauce on sautéed mushrooms on top of garlic bread) are always tasty.   I love the wine list here, and the bread and dipping plate at the start of the meal. Basically Ferro is not my favourite overall, but not bad either. I will probably come back eventually, just don't have the desire to eat here every week."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is my go to go place whenever i feel like something homemade,  its really close to where i live plus its a great spot to dine, atmosphere is cozy food is amazing,really good, never had any disappointments the grilled calamari is my favourite soooo good please try it."}
