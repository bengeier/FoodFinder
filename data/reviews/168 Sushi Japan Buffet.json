{"text":"Decor and iPad menu was cool ... Food was prompt but the service was bad. The manager was also quite rude. There were also many missed orders (in their defense we had a party of 10). The rolls that came were inconsistent (some rolls had warm rice, brought wrong types of rolls to our table, still fail to understand how that happened as everything was tracked on the iPad ...).

No major complaints about the food, there were many selections and it was prompt albeit incorrect.

The expensive pricing and poor service will not bring me back."}
{"text":"The food is great...one of the best sushi places I've been to. The service is great as well. The only problem is the manager. The asian male manger is very annoying when it comes to tip. I've dealt with him 3 times and he literally asks for tip at the end. Even though I end up paying nearly 15% every time, he will still ask you to your face \"is that it?\". Otherwise its a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I went 2 weeks ago on a Saturday; I've been to Sushi 168 'pre' and 'post' renovation, and over time the quality has substantially diminished. They've become busier, and as a result, they've stopped making (or giving off the appearance that their food is made) to order. I believe that's the biggest mistake a restaurant can make - feed more customers at the expense of quality and freshness.

The food came out quickly...a little too quickly, suggesting that the restaurant simply wants to turn tables as quickly as possible. The hot foods came out cold, and did not look or taste fresh. They should hire more sushi chefs to do things right, and make food to order, rather than churn out a lot of rolls at once, that are left sitting there until they're ordered. It's backwards management and a symptom of greed in my opinion.

You can find better elsewhere, unfortunately Mississauga doesn't have much, so this restaurant has succeeded in attracting customers for the time being. Go elsewhere...the service and quality will be a lot better. It's worth the drive to Toronto or further east for better quality AYCE."}
{"text":"Come on Yelpers, would someone please write a scathing review of this place and drive the current ridiculous volume of customers elsewhere from this new restaurant. It was packed again yesterday and far too many people were lined up outside waiting for over an hour to get in. If you have to, prod a disgruntled nearby competitor into doing the deed as so often seems to happen on that R site. 

Can't we enjoy just a little easy access to affordable quality dining experiences out here in the 'burbs? We simply don't have the awesome range of choices that downtown Toronto Yelpers have. 

So please completely disregard my earlier review and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The place seems a bit haphazard but there were loads of options and the sushi was good for the most part. iPad ordering was a bonus! I really liked the variety in dessert options."}
{"text":"I forced my husband to go for sushis.  He is not a fan of sushi so I wanted him to try from a place that had good reviews. So I choose sushi buffet, thinking in a buffet one can experiment with food. However, this place had a very expensive bigger and on to of that if you don't eat anything they charge you for that. Ideally I like the latter part of their policy but not for the price of their buffet. So we decided to go by the menu. We had vegetarian pad Thai noodles and a vegetarian sushi combo. They brought the componentry soup and salad. Only one little bowls of each for two of us. Followed by our food. The food was undoubtedly good. My husband loved it. We had a complete meal with some left overs for the price of one buffet.
I may go there again. The day I will be feeling rich and have craving for Japanese this would be the place I will go to."}
{"text":"I use to enjoy this restaurant, that being said I was young and favoured quantity or quality. The inconsistency is the only consistency. Way too much rice in the sushi, you will get full quick if you are not mindful. Some items on the menu are not too bad, such as the chicken dishes and tempura. All in all I think my last visit will be my last visit."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this sushi restaurant. It was a great experience - I enjoyed the use of the iPad ordering feature. The overall atmosphere of the environment is very \"club-like\" and would not be suggested to someone who enjoys a quiet environment. Ideal for a younger or hip crowd."}
{"text":"Every time I crave sushi and lots of it - I'm here. They updated and renovated the place so it's super modern now and there menu's are on iPads. The servers there are friendly for the most part and are always quick to make sure your drink is filled and that if you want more food they're putting the order in right away. No complaints so far and I've gone here for many occasions"}
{"text":"We had lunch there on Saturday and the service was fast, courteous and efficient. Never saw the bottom of my tea cup. Paid $38 for 2, tip and taxes included. Highly recommend the snapper and salmon roses if you want more fish than rice. Good value."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it never disappoints... No nasty surprises you get what you paid for. Pricing is the same on weekends and weekdays. Typical selection of menu items. If you want something safe and usual this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I came here since it opened 7yrs. Ago It was good then the food quality went south the price went up too bad I just live 2min. From this place"}
{"text":"Management/ownership must've changed in the past year or so, as this place is not what it used to be. If I had written this review over a year ago, I would have given it 5 stars. However, now the food is not as good/fresh as it used to be, and they also started charging for soda. I used to loooove their spicy salmon crisp but they seem to use less of something because it's so dry now. The overall quality of the food has declined, which is a huge disappointment for a place that used to be so consistently good. I used to be able to overlook the terrible location and odd decor, but now it is just overall below average....sad to see its demise."}
{"text":"Courteous staff. Busy place but I was seated pretty quick and within a few moments of placing my order the dim sum items arrived. Great value but food was average."}
{"text":"My husband and were looking for a restaurant to host a lunch to celebrate our son's christening and 168 sushi was one we looked into. We're so glad we did as the restaurant did an outstanding job accommodating 85 guests who arrived and were starving all at the same time. Before we put a deposit down for the party we went for lunch and were impressed with the quality of food for its price point. The restaurant was busy but our server was attentive and food arrived fairly quickly so we were happy to confirm and put a deposit down. Our server suggested that we call the restaurant before the party to confirm numbers and pre order food so our guests wouldn't have to wait. We were so glad we as everyone was hungry and ready to eat upon arrival. The restaurant was so accommodating to all of our requests especially regarding the cake that was brought in. They put out a special table in the middle of the room to serve from and provided a knife, plates and cutlery to eat with. My friends and family left the restaurant happy and with filled bellies. Also, just a shout out to Elsa, our server. She was the one who made us feel confident to book the restaurant. There's nothing more I can say about 168 sushi, they have won me over. Great staff, service, quality and value."}
{"text":"Price of the AYCE is not worth it. The one in Vaughan is way way better. 
If you are looking for a good quality sushi lower your expectation and then you will be satisfied with this branch.
I must say the food presentation is good but the rest are just \"meh.\" Sashimi are cut into tiny pieces and they put too much rice on the rolls, you can't even tell the flavor.
The ordering thru ipad is not that impressive anymore, sure you get to order thru the ipad but you still have to call your server for them to send your request., there are sushi places in Vauhan/Woodbridge area that does this. The servers are not rude but I noticed they are friendly towards the non-asians."}
{"text":"Dined at this restaurant last thursday night. Arrived around 830 and the place was packed. However, we were seated promptly and were pleased that a waitress approached us immediately for our drink orders. 
I've been to numerous AUCE restaurants and I have to rank this one at the top of my list. The food came very quickly but a few items that we had ordered were forgotten. Once reminded, they quickly made our order. At times it was difficult to flag down a waiter to take our orders which was a bit frustrating
The real standouts were the dumplings, the seared salmon and tuna sashimi, the white tuna tempura roll(delicious), black snow roll, red snow roll and the tempura banana roll (that was my favourite!). I didn't order any of the cooked stirfried dishes but they looked delicious. I also liked that they took the time to ensure that the food was presented nicely instead of just plopped on a plate. Servers were also pleasant which seems to be a rarity among AUCE restaurants.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant and can't wait to return soon!"}
{"text":"There lunch buffet is cheap and food is delicious. They are super busy which I think confuses the waiters at times. We had to ask for got sauce a few times before receiving it. Over all great experience and will definitely dinner here in the near future."}
{"text":"Very hip restaurant with decent AYCE prices! They have a fairly large menu for the price you pay, even at lunch. Weekend lunch is only $16! Great value, since I usually eat AYCE at lunch and it fills me up even until dinner time. 2 meals with 1 bill!

The only sad thing is that lunch doesn't include sashimi. Some places serve the basics, like salmon and tuna at lunch, but I think a lot of sushi places are scrapping that, sadly. I guess if they do add that to the menu, they'd have to bump up their lunch price too.

But other than that, I have no complaints about this place. Service is extremely fast, and you can call the waiter at the touch of a button! The iPad is extremely convenient. You can view the entire menu, place your orders, call the waiter, and he/she will send the order to the kitchen. 

My first experience here was great and I'd definitely come back and recommend to anyone looking for a new sushi place to try! You might find a new favourite."}
{"text":"I used to love this sushi restaurant, but I feel like it's gone seriously downhill.  I've ordered for delivery and eaten in the restaurant before:

In restaurant - fish is declining in quality and service is worse.  It takes forever for your order to come out (and this is with two sushi chefs and an almost empty restaurant).  The service is efficient if not exactly friendly.  I've come back several times in the hopes that it had somehow gone back to when it was a better restaurant, but I am always disappointed.

Delivery - I've ordered twice.  The first time one of the dishes we ordered had a HUGE STAPLE in it.  So dangerous.  We called the place to tell them, and they were like \"Oh, sorry, thanks for letting us know\".  No offer of a refund or at minimum sending out a new order.  Appalling.  The second time it was okay (again, I\"m one of those second chance kind of people) but they forget to send soy sauce, wasabi and ginger.  Kind of important details to miss out on.  

There are better sushi places in Brampton now (I recommend Toshi) - owners, you really need to get your acts together."}
{"text":"Although the restaraunt atmosphere is quite inviting, the quality and taste of sushi and rolls is sketchy at best. Most rolls taste exactly the same, despite their colorful arrangement of ingredients, which might suggest that the quality of the ingredients and sauces lacks in freshness and selection.
The service was timely and friendly. Thank you. Not really sure what Mediterranean  music has to do with a Japanese cuisine, but trust me, I've heard worse."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the quality of food is great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who is interested in getting sushi or wants teriyaki/tempura food choices. The service is a bit sub-par but overall the food taste compensates."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian and are hooked to sushi, this is the place for you. They have fun options like crispy, spicy avacado sushi and mushroom tempura sushi and many more. The crispy spicy tofu is quite good if you can handle a little kick. As for service, most waiters don't speak much english but are very friendly. They even have private booths in the back. This place is definately worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Worth a try just for their signature items. Avoid the pad Thai though. One thing was for sure, their service was better than most AYCE sushi places. For once, we actually got all the things we ordered, and the numbers didn't get messed up!"}
{"text":"Plain, nothing special. Sushi was ok, Las Vegas sushi were yummy I must say. All the other dishes (Thai, Korean) were not the greatest."}
{"text":"Amazing food, speed service, friendly staff, clean facility, reasonable price. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Was really good but I am never impressed with all u can eats. The a la Carte is always better. :("}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place - kids love the AYCE and being able to order their own food 
on the ipads - cool setup. OK food, always packed. Nice for kids on the when they are really hungry (little on the expensive side otherwise)."}
{"text":"Went with a girlfriend of mine and we both loved it. It was my first time there and I was not disappointed, we did the AYCE menu and the selection is immense. The sushi was really good and so was the service. Would go back again! My favorite dish was the Black Snow Rol.l"}
{"text":"Pros
-sushi is very good 
-everything tasted fresh
-nice atmosphere 
Cons
-I dislike how the staff has to approve the order due to the fact that the their is limited staff and your waiter never seems to be around
-same go for refills on your drink, it takes forever. 
-pretty pricey"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for a reason. I've never had a bad experience and the food is always delicious. The staff are friendly, and always try to make your stay as good as possible."}
{"text":"The private rooms are great.

The staff are friendly and accommodating.

The sushi, um, not so much BUT it's always a safe choice for me to go to this sushi joint. I'd rate the sushi 6/10. The sashimi 5/10. They have dine in, take out and delivery. I've dined in here and also had delivery."}
{"text":"People are pretty hard on this place because of the service/wait times. Yes, this place is usually busy and there will be a wait on weekends for lunch and dinner. The price is fair for lunch. The service is good to be honest, they're fast and on top of things, sometimes they forget stuff but hey, you just simply reorder it off your iPad and call the server. 10% off with cash too(might be 5% now). Best lunch menu for Ayce."}
{"text":"This is easily my favourite sushi restaurant in Brampton. The food is always amazing quality and have never had a problem with my orders. The food is delicious and they have such a great variety of things to choose from (my favourite being the salmon roses). As for price, it's definitely on the cheaper side for AYCE sushi places as I've seen them go 23+ and I believe Japan Buffet is around $20. The service is also pretty good and since they started using the ipads, you receive your food so ridiculously fast. I also love the fact that you can have private rooms if you're on a date or want to be a bit more private."}
{"text":"Good price. 
Okay food. It's a buffet...
They have some Sui Mai and Har Gow on the menu which is a bonus.
Thai curry recently added. What a watery mess.
The sushi is boring but
gets you full on a dime.
It's a buffet."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted old. Special requests are hard to order. Too busy. Selection for sushi, limited. Large kitchen menu though. Best part was the fried rice. Not recommended"}
{"text":"We were impressed with how packed it was and we only waited 10 minutes for a table. We liked ordering off the tablet. The food arrived really fast and it was all good. Most importantly, this place is also clean. There are also vegetarian choices. We will be back.  Though the name states that it's a buffet, it is a sit down place. You can order as much as you like."}
{"text":"Staff were very pleasant and attentive. Price was comparable with other AYCE. Maki rolls - presentation was good, signature rolls had good flavor profile. Sashimi was great size and fresh. The teriyaki beef was the weakest dish of the night.  I was there oct 12 and they must have just painted because there was still the smell of fresh paint in the air."}
{"text":"OK quality. Fish is not always fresh. I recently moved from Hamilton and frankly speaking Hamilton offers much better and fresh sushi. Have to try some other sushi places around. Not coming back here ..."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty plain exterior, which belies a pleasant surprise inside.  Keep in mind this is based on a Sunday night visit, but it was busy, but not packed to the brim.  There were at least two birthday party's as well, as evidenced by the \"happy birthday\" rendition playing over the speakers!! 

Anybody reading my previous reviews would know that I'm not a huge fan of raw fish, which kind of rules out sushi or sashimi.  However, even I was wiling to try out a few pieces.

First off, the order system is self-checked, but slightly difficult to match the items with the standard fare.  It took me halfway through the meal to figure out Scallop Tempura was the delectable deep-fried scallops I love to eat.

I did like the ample supply of menu cards and the provided pen, all in an easy organizer.  It helped keeping track of what we ordered much easier, and also kept the menu placards out of the way.  Many other places often have those plastic menu cards that you have to find a place for on an already crowded table.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the service was quite fast - within 10 minutes of placing our big order, the plates started coming out and at quite a rapid pace.  I particularly appreciated how the items were often grouped together onto a larger plate before arriving, which helped to save on table estate.

Throughout the meal the service staff also came by quite often to remove the finished empty plates.  Of course, it helped that we vacuumed our food and were more strategic about getting rid of plates!

The cooked menus were pretty good - spicy chicken / tofu were flavorful and spicy, and the tempura was pretty decent.  The deep fried tofu was nice and hot, but the crispy tofu was not as enjoyable.

I would strongly advise not getting the dumplings or spring rolls, both were not particularly good.  

The specialty rolls were all nicely done, tight and not-falling apart.  I'm not big on sushi but I did enjoy the playful interaction between the fruit ingredients and the other elements.

 The salmon head was quite a pleasant surprise - it was meaty and well done - not too dry or burnt.  

Dessert included the standard ice cream flavours - you have your red bean, vanilla, green tea, and mango.  The mango was very smooth, and the green tea was decent.  We also got the banana tempura - really it's deep fried banana in a batter.  It was decent - I've had better, but it was a good way to cap off a good evening.

My buddy recommended the restaurant to me on a spur-of-the-moment request, and I have to say that the experience was better than the other (limited) AYCE around 'sauga, and the location was much more roomy and comfortable than most other places in Markham.  I went in half-crippled on one crutch with a leg injury, so that was a bonus!"}
{"text":"Finally we went for their dinner buffet tonight.  This place was so packed.  They don't take same day reservations or may be just on weekends.  We got a number to wait for the table.  But the wait was not bad.  

They offer ipad menu and I was pleased to see some good variety.  Sushi was fantastic and great quality.  Definitely one if the better ayce sushi places I've been to.  Service was also good and people were friendly."}
{"text":"Very slow service and food are mediocre.  They should have schedule more staff on Family Day holiday. Salmon sushi was bad as rice distingrate in soy sauce before we could put in mouth. 
Remember to order lots as it take them so long to bring food out. Also we ordered like 20 Salmon Sushi but close to 15 came out. Wait in between dishes were like 15 minutes. Ginger ale pop was only $1 but very watered down. Squid  and shrimp tempura were decent. 
At least our family had some serious free time for chatting and tablet time in between dishes."}
{"text":"168 was one of the first sushi places in Brampton, which meant no competition. The first few years they had decent service and decent food, but it seems as the years progressed the food there has suffered. Every time I go there now it's always a hit or miss, but quite a few misses than hits. The first time I ate sushi was at this restaurant and I was a regular there for the first few years, until competition came in. 

The last time I ate there it was an hour before closing. As we were eating one employee mopped right by our table and around a few others that still had customers. This left a strong smell of bleach and it completely turned me off from eating the rest of my meal. The salmon sashimi this time was very poor, trying to pick it up it hung limp and fell apart. I was very disappointed. That and on top of watching the owner talk on his phone then proceed to cutting sashimi for orders without washing his hands has really turned me off from eating there for good."}
{"text":"Heard about it from a friend and it did turn out to be great! From service to iPad menus to price, after trying various sushi restaurants I think I've finally found THE go to sushi place. Our server was Shirley and she was the best! Service is quick and portions are perfect for all you can eat menu so you can try a variety of items, I think my favorite was the 'pink lady' roll but dragon and mango rolls were good too."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband. Lovely atmosphere, we had a great server that was very friendly and social! Really enjoyed the private rooms. Ordering from the tablets were convenient, and our food came really quick. Only reason we have it a 4 star is we didn't get one dish we had ordered, so might have to keep an eye on that. Otherwise, it's a great place for all you can eat sushi fix! Clean place and yummy food."}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time we came to this place. I have no complains in regards to the food at all or even with the server. 
BUT my complain is with their MANDATORY TIPPING and the manager.

Valentines day today, so their lunch rates are higher than the usual. We paid $29.99 each, 4 persons in our party. I paid with my debit and on the machine it will ask you if you want to give 10%, 20% or \"other\" tip. I chose other, then the server said I need to give her additional money because \"the tip is not yet included\". I was confuse as I saw on the machine the total of our bill plus tip. At the mean time I still gave her cash. I decide to check my online banking on my phone and I saw that I was charged including the tip already. So I asked the manager (I think his name is Phillip) to dhow me the receipt. He kept telling me I'm not understanding the receipt and keeps pointing on the receipt which only shows our food bill and he keeps saying that the tip wasn't included. There's 2 receipts stapled together, on top is the copy straight from the debit machine which shows how much tip we gave. He explained that \"we can tip whatever amount we want\". But then he said because we gave less than what they expected that why we have to give more.

I got pissed off and just walked away. I felt disrespected on how he talked to me like I have no common knowledge and don't know how to read a receipt. (It's easy to see the work \"tip\" there, it's not like it's written in another language) I always tip every time I dine in but I thought tipping is a courtesy to your server and like what he said whatever generous amount you want to give. I have no idea that they are the one's who will decide for you. And if you don't give what they want they will make you pay! 

Very very disappointed with the manager. Love the food but I don't think the food will make me come back."}
{"text":"Very slow service that got our order wrong several times. Fish quality was decent but rolls were made sloppily. Veggies were not very fresh -- the avocado was definitely overripe and had a bit of an \"off\" flavor. Grilled meats (teriyaki chicken, kalbi beef) were well seasoned but overcooked. The menu had good variety, which is probably this place's only redeeming quality. Would not recommend for this price."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food - great selection on their menu.  For a buffet, the sushi/sashimi/rolls are surprisingly good.  Tempura is great as well.

Less than 1 star for service: The servers have a tendency to walk past without checking on their customers.  They never get the orders right .  Since we tend to order a lot of sushi/sashimi, sometimes I wonder if they intentionally forget these items (it's always these items they forget)."}
{"text":"Ive been to all 168 locations over several years, but this one is the best! Lots of items on the menu so if you don't feel like having just sushi, you have options. 

Best time to go on weekdays is around 4. Not too many customers so service is quick and the quality is the best--especially the avocado rolls."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I simply LOVE Sushi, but this was our first authentic sushi restaurant experience. And since it was close to home, we decided to give it a try. Its all you can eat for $20.00 CAD and they MEAN all you can eat - deserts and drinks included. I have never been so full from sushi in my life. They have a wide variety of different dishes from tempura to sashimi. We did a little bit of trial and error from what we did like to what we didn't like but mostly everything was good. If you like sushi and don't mind dishing out 20 bucks for a good meal, I do recommend 168 Sushi. But be careful how much you order, they charge 50 cents for every piece left over."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Brampton. Service is always quick. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A decent ayce sushi place. Crazy busy all the time though.. I'd prefer not to wait 30-45 min just for a table. The food is good overall. Not the best quality, but most ayce places are like that. The price is comparable to other ayce places in Mississauga, but still a bit high."}
{"text":"Wow K.... I'm kinda embarassed to have suggested this place for a birthday celebration dinner. I suggested it because I've been to the Dundas (Mississauga location) and it was more or less good. However, TLDR, this place was a disappointment.

We came to the place, were greeted warmly and sat down. We ordered our first round of food, less than 15 minutes later, the food came as expected. The sushi/sashimi/rolls were pretty awesome, not overloaded with rice on the outside/inside, sashimi was pretty fresh. We ordered kitchen menu items as well such as kalbi, miso soup, seaweed salid, curry, tempura, pretty typical but decent. 

Things started going downhill on second round of food. They brought half our food that we ordered, we noticed the service was slower and had to wait a little longer for food, but we were okay with that because the restaurant was visibly a lot more busy. Lots of big groups came in. Okay.... but then the other half of the second round food items we ordered did NOT come at all. Just when we were about to complain, the servers eventually noticed that we were just sitting with no food on the table and individually they all came and asked if we were waiting on something. We said we were, and they responded by saying they would check the kitchen. Only one server ever came back with any sort of response, saying our kitchen receipt was lost and that our sushi/roll receipt was still there. So we accepted the fact and waited for the rolls to come. 

The same server came back more than once to reconfirm that our kitchen receipt was lost, and to reaffirm that the rolls were coming. Two reaffirmations later, he ended up making me reorder the roll (Fruit roll 4 pcs). The roll came, but only two pcs? That makes perfect sense. 

The entire second round took about an HOUR before we gave up, and we did not even get what we wanted. During that time, the what would seem like a manager guy walked by a few times, saw our empty table and did nothing. I could understand sushi places \"forgetting\" orders after a customer repeatedly orders large batches, but fact was, it was only the SECOND round. Furthermore we had only ordered about 8-9 items only.  I simply wanted the second round, desserts and then call it quits. 

Nope, don't know if this happens to others, but THIS PLACE WANTS YOU TO LEAVE AFTER A CERTAIN POINT. If you resist, they will just make you wait and \"lose\" your receipt. I don't understand why they couldn't just satisfy our order, and leave it at that. They would have made more business by satisfying us so that we would leave sooner. We were a decently large group too so they were definitely not losing money on us. The servers overall were nice and attentive, but the service overall from the kitchen and food preparation staff was despicable.

Would never come back to this place again. Sayonarra 168 mediocre buffet."}
{"text":"I have been going to 168 Sushi from the first day it opened. The owners continue to upgrade their menu. Recently, they added a soup, salad and desert bar to the restaurant. They sacrificed a couple of booths in order to make this upgrade.

I find the food and the service to be extremely good."}
{"text":"I just went to 168 Japan Sushi buffet on wednesday and there was a sign that said it was permanently closed by the public health authority. No clue what was going on there but it used to be my favuorite sushi AYCE spot. It must have been pretty big to have them close the place permanently though."}
{"text":"This place is totally worth a trip out here. The food is fresh, decor is nice, service is good, and the menu is massive. If you come for lunch it's under $20, which is an insane deal!"}
{"text":"Best  bang for your  buck  t during the  lunch  hours  love the kalbi  beef and  tempura  as well.  Try the milk  pudding"}
{"text":"I came here this past weekend and was quite disappointed. I have been here at least 15 times in the past and have usually enjoyed it by this time was horrid.

It was packed with people so you would naturally assume all food would be continuously made fresh and made to order...wrong! 

All food tasted and felt like it was made in very large capacity and sitting around for a while. I think they do this on busy days in terms of efficiency but unfortunately the product suffered severely. I'd suggest going on a quiet day to ensure all food is truly made to order.

Ill be going to the orignal Brampton location moving forward, iPad or not. 

Also service was quite rude!"}
{"text":"First time visiting 168 Sushi. Service was excellent and food was executed efficiently even though the they were full. Will Definitely return"}
{"text":"I like coming here anytime I want ayce sushi. The sushi is always fresh and the service is usually fast. It is a little pricey but it is worth it. Recommend the beef ribs and any of the handrolls. Also anything teppanyaki they do a great job as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely loveeeee this place! Highly recommended 

It has great food, ambiance and service. Would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"The salmon is good. The shrimp tempura is very light and super crispy.  Beef ribs are a bit fatty but tasty. Decent eel. Nice presentation. Food comes out fast.  Chicken kabob is ok but somewhat flavorless. Tuna is white not the deep rich red I'm used to. The spicy Korean beef is delicious.  They have lots of stuff on the menu besides sushi.

The place is large, the staff was pretty on top of things and overall it was a decent experience.  Not the best sushi ever but not bad.  The things I mentioned that were good were very pretty (I'd give them a 4).  The other stuff was fair, I'd give those items a 2.  Overall, I'd say a 3 is fair."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for early dinner last night. Overall, it was a-OK dining experience based on food quality and service. 

Let's talk about the food quality. Their sushi and sashimi are quite fresh and delicious, but not so much with their hot dishes. I am not a picky eater and I don't expect a AYCE restaurant to excel in every dish, but it is quite unacceptable to pay $30 bucks to be served with semi-burnt and rubbery Kalbi Ribs and  Beef and Enoki Mushroom Rolls. If you are a big fan of sushi, great. I highly recommend the BBQ White Tuna sushi, Spicy Salmon on Potato Chip, and Spicy Salmon Crispy Maki Rolls. 

Bad service was the reason why I rated 3 out of 5. It definitely got worse than the first time I visited. To be precise, the service was a lot better before the renovation. 

Having the customers to order with an I-Pad is definitely a gimmick to stand out from other AYCE restaurants. I am not against it. I think it is a very cool idea and it is environmentally friendly; however, there is definitely room for improvement. Every time I completed an order, I had to call the server to confirm it. We couldn't confirm ourselves since it required a password. I don't see the point why this procedure is needed. The second problem was that the number of orders for each food item you ordered would not reset by itself. We ordered 10 pcs of salmon Sashimi for the first round. We wanted to order more for the second round, but we got very confused. The number stayed at 10 pcs, and when we added on, it would go from... 11...12...13.... We did not know whether they would end up giving us 3 pcs or 13 pcs. 

When we finished dinner, we waited 20 minutes to clear our bill, not cool. I think they should hire more servers to do the job."}
{"text":"Love the iPad menu, and the price is right too. Food quality I would say average, they don't serve sashimi by itself here and most of their sushi has mostly rice over fish.  Noise level is some what loud and it's hard for the staff to hear you, would be a good idea to add napkins, refill and water in the ordering menu. Overall good place, good feel, good staff and fast service."}
{"text":"This location used to the Happy Court Chinese buffet until it changed to 168 Sushi Japanese Buffet years back.  I have driven by so many times and always wondering what it looks like on the inside.  Finally, I went it last night with a friend for dinner!  We were both surprised by the decor.  It was very modern with lots of booths.

Their menu had a variety of hot and cold items.  We ordered from the deluxe menu which encompassed the whole menu and then some.
We started ordering right away, 40 pieces of maki sushi, dim sum, spicy Korean tofu, seaweed salad, yakatori and salmon tekayki. The food was brought to our table in waves.  We tired to make sure we ate and cleared our plates as efficiently as possible.  It felt like we were in a sushi factory.
Everything tasted very good and was neatly presented.

Total for two was just under $60.  Not bad considering the variety of food we ate.

168 Sushi has other locations in west end as well.  I would definitely come back and bring my family and friends."}
{"text":"Great and fresh food with very friendly service. When you know a great sushi place you stick to it, I'm sticking to this one."}
{"text":"Great service. I have been coming here for 4 years. Guess what? Now I can barely finish 4 sushis. Why? MSG! I feel it in my mouth. The owner is not in or else I would verbally say this. So unfortunate. I will not be back. Please stop using MSG."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch, was amazed by the fast service, we only waited less than 10mins for each order. Each table was provided an iPad for order taking, makes the menu reading and ordering part much more efficient.
As most of the AYCE places, no sashimi for the lunch menu, decent selection of maki , sushi and tempuras.
4/5 for food, nothing too stunning, but I loved the size of the maki and sushi, they were made  small(perfect sized), so I can try many different ones without getting too full. 
Will definitely come back when I crave AYCE sushi.
Ps, the fried tofu I had was not very fresh, didn't affect the whole experience though"}
{"text":"It was pretty interesting instead of using paper to write down the menus and we end up using the ipad to order and verifying with the waiter/waitress to make sure what we order. The service is a lot slower than usual but like food quality was decent better than eating at mall sushis. The place is renovated pretty nice with the modern style lounge and chill out!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I were having late night cravings for sushi and decided to come slightly later than we though. We weren't informed that there was a salad bar in the back when we sat down, expecting the wasabi to come plated with out rolls. 

We ordered quite a bit of food because myself one other are big eaters, but when we submitted the orders, the waitresses gave us a look and walked back to tell the her other colleagues that we weren't gonna finish it. They informed that if we submit our desserts now, we'll receive it when we're all done with our food. Not to mention it was still about half an hour before they were officially close so we had time.

Food came really quickly and for some reason our desserts were brought out as well prematurely which in the end, ended up melting (ice cream).

Food was good but the service was dreadfully awful. Waitresses speaking in their languages realizing the one of us can understand is very unprofessional. Would not recommend if you don't want to be rushed and disrespected."}
{"text":"My mother was visiting from out of town and we decided to go here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The place was very busy and we had a 5-10 minute wait for a table.

This is probably the most well-organized AYCE sushi place I have been to.  I really like the idea of checking boxes on cards for what you want to eat (vs. having to write it all out, etc).  The organization of the cards was also very clear which made for easy ordering for the people with certain food preferences.

Quaility of the food was very good - above average for an AYCE sushi restaurant.  Everything was fresh, the sashimi size was what you would get at a regular sushi restaurant and the flavors of the cooked foods were great as well.

Service was spot on, attentive plus friendly.

If it wasn't out in Mississauga I would go more often.

Tip: Don't go up Erin Mills Parkway from the QEW - the left turn on to Dundas is a gong-show.  Go to up Winston Churchill and then turn right on Dundas.  The resto is on the South side of the street."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Came here for lunch on a weekday. The hostess was flirting with the bartenders. Me and my guests stood there and waited 20 minutes to be seated. 

When she did notice us, she said they will clear a table for us but the busboy didn't clean the table for another 20 minutes. 

In total we waited 40 minutes to be seated because they really don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"I was amazed by how fast and proficient the service was during a busy family day holiday. Good food, good quality. I'll definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"WOW where do I start with this one. In my opinion....

Don't know if this place is called japanese sushi or 168 sushi....sign off road is strange. Dirty carpet at entrance stated 168 sushi. don't know if it's related to the franchise

This is my first review on yelp and this place caused it. After reading the 5 and 4 star reviews here I actually hunted for this place (as its in the back of a dirty plaza....first clue).  If you gave this place 5 stars, get your head checked and get a culinary  clue, cause you make 5 star restaurants look bad. consistancy is the mile stick 

Quick breakdown on food ordered : (received is another story)

Kalbi
sushi salmon, whitefish
shrimp/squid  tempura
rainbow roll
salmon/avacado  roll (3 times cause they couldn't get the order right)
salmon teriyaki 
mackerel 

Time of visit 11:30, restaurant half full, 3 sushi chefs, plenty of wait staff

The good:

it was open
temperature  of food was pleasant


The bad: from start to finish

tried to seat me at the table right beside main door when many better tables available....nope

kalbi served was literally the bone and just connective grissel.  I reordered it and 3 bones with %90 fat came out. One piece was proper. taste was good waited 30 min and had to ask twice where my order was.  They lost the order twice

sushi fish was good temperature  was good. 1/2 a golf ball of rice not appreciated 

tempura temp/taste was good. To much batter for my liking (filler)

rainbow roll was good, we'll assembled no complaints 

salmon/avocado roll...what a disaster. they just couldn't get the order right. first presentation was a crab roll. Second attempt was missing the avacado. This is the kicker..Their last attempt they tried to serve me the blood line of the salmon. I pulled and cut it out, leaving it on the table clearly making sure it was understood what they tried to pull on me. disrespectful sushi chefs. oh ya waited 30 min for this also

salmon teriyaki  was good temp/taste. sauce was nice

mackerel head on one side was burnt black. overcooked obviously as it was a little dry, overall flavor was good 


Warning, this is the gross part. I had to use the bathroom before I left. I opened the door and walked into a wall smell or stale urine,  warm stewing temperature body functions and a complete pig filthy hot mess of a bathroom. This caused my stomach to instantly turn over and I barely made it to the toilet to throw up, The sticky floors, broken paper dispensers , soap dispenser, ceiling tiles, dated (70's) decor. ..awesome. They haven't cleaned behind the toilet in months. I don't want to even think of the kitchen practices after this.....EWW  JUST EWW 

Glad to scratch this place off my list......right off"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to sushi joint, but in recent years I have been going to sushi restaurants outside Brampton, that had more adventurous menus and modern interior designs. I returned for lunch today and quite enjoyed my meal, especially the kitchen items. The kitchen was as good as I remembered. The I-pad menus are relatively new and were easy to use.

Japan Buffet continues to be what it has always been - an unpretentious, comfortable local AYCE restaurant. It was the first AYCE restaurant in Brampton, and during its ten years, several competitors have come and gone. I applaud their consistency and staying power."}
{"text":"I have been to other locations of 168 Sushi and my experience has always been a good one, therefor I return to those locations and it was my reason for my visit to this one. But needles to say this location is not like the others.

Two starts for the cooked rolls, friendly staff and the nice decor.

The soy sauce was watered down and wasabi was tasteless. I always use a very small amount of wasabi as since I don't like it when it over powers the food, but this one was so bad that no matter how much I was putting on I could not taste it.  

I ordered several selections, the first ones to arrive were BBQ eel and spicy tempura California plus Dynamite roll. These were nice, but they arrived in less than two minutes from my order being placed, it seemed odd that they were this fast, hmm, but, I figured hey, I'm pressed for time so maybe it's my lucky day.

Before I was done with the first ones, mind you I am a fast eater especially since I was alone and not talking to anyone, came rest of my order and I moved onto California and Tuna rolls, this where the ship hit the iceberg.
The fish had a very odd/bad taste, I was actually spitting out chunks of it that tasted bad and it was uneatable.
I tried to see if I could simply take the tuna out, this is when I discovered the fish was gooey and simply like a paste was smearing onto my chopsticks. 

Then I realized how they were able to manage such quick preparation times.

I have never had food problems before but after having dinner at this location I was having digestive issues late into the night. I'm just happy I did not get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Thoroughly surprised with how good this place turned out to be. 

I'm not a fan of AYCE, since let's face it, sushi/sashimi buffets can go wrong on so many levels, as the number one concern is clearly NOT quality. But this place wasn't disappointing.

As an avid Hinote spicy salmon lover, I actually liked their spicy salmon rolls & hand rolls here. It was flavourful and had a nice spice (not the Sarracha sauce other Japanese restos try to pass off). Their menu is fairly large with a lot of cool items, such as the \"chip spicy salmon\" aka spicy salmon on a pringles chip, all different types of tempura, salmon roses, thai curry, even some Chinese dim sum items. I didn't try that as I didn't think a Japanese restaurant would do chinese food justice, but who knows, might be worth it? Also, the pringles chip was a regular salted one and after time, got tremendously salty altogether. But the first few were fun and delicious to eat.

I'll definitely go here when I'm in the mood to gorge out on sushi & kalbi goodness. I definitely suggest this place, especially for large parties where not everyone likes raw fish.

Oh. I will mention too that the soy sauce given is the really really dark one meant for COOKING, not sushi. So be weary of that. It was a turn-off for some of the sashimi lovers, like myself."}
{"text":"Sometime the wait can be a bit long, but out of all the sushi places that I've tried....this one is the best. I went on valentines day and my food came so fast that I swear it was made before I ordered, soooo good. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food: ok to good. Service SUCKS. Just the waitresses. Its ALWAYS been like this. This will be my last time here.  By the end of my birthday get together I wanted to take my malfunctioning ipad and smack my server with it."}
{"text":"A decent ayce sushi location but they charge you a premium to sit in the better locations of the restaurant. 

The service is hit or miss and can really alter the dining experience. Tablet ordering minimizes human interaction which is nice.

Fish quality is pretty good and the ribs are actually amazing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for AYCE albeit I find Sushi on 7 higher as far as quality goes. What I love about this place is the food is good enough, parking is sufficient, place is huge, and they have the best staff of an AYCE Ive ever been in.

This is the only decent  place Ive tried so far that uses the \"fill in a form\" system of ordering wherein you just fill-in a form specifying what you want and how much you want and just hand it to the staff and youre done.

The more common system where a waitress gets your order like in a regular resto is such a pain compared to this. You have to remember what you want, how much, while looking at the menu and this happens while she stands there writing everything up. No wonder service is never good at these things. The waitresses have to stand there waiting for a fickle customer to be through while other people are waiting in line suffering. 

Also, it has AYCE tempura, soda, ice cream and lots more. This place is awesome. I believe lunch is at $14-$15 on weekends."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times and service and food have gone downhill bad! Waitresses rarely talk to you it's hard to get a refill on drink most of the time and sometimes food comes all at once and other times it takes forever!  Place on outside looks kind of dumpy and gross with paint peeling and building not taken care of, trash and buckets all around. The good is price isn't too bad and you get discount for paying cash! NO DEBIT though only cash or credit this is just to make you use the ATM they have inside I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Came here during a vacation. They have many different selections and varieties here! Sushi was good and the many different appetizers are also tasty as well. 

You order using the iPad where they have pictures of the food which is very convenient so you know exactly what you're ordering. There are some food in the center where you go up to get yourself. Other than that, everything you order through the iPad the waiters will bring over to the table. Service was fast and waiters were helpful.

The decorations are very nice as well. Very dim and decorations are very modern, overall good place."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. My kids fav resturant."}
{"text":"There's something about this place that I keep gravitating towards. It's not the greatest sushi place that's ever existed but it's still pretty decent. Not to mention, all you can eat! Who doesn't like a good sushi buffet? You order through an iPad which is super convenient. And it has quite a selection of sushis, entrees (rice, noodles), etc."}
{"text":"O.M.G.!!!!!

For $22 (5% discount if you pay in cash) you can stuff yourself silly with high quality sushi and sashimi.  How does this place make money?!

The food was fantastic!  Standouts were the spicy salmon chips - bits of salmon sashimi mixed with spicy mayo sauce on pringles, scallop (imitation scallop) tempura, and spicy salmon and spicy white fish rolls.  

I had a fantastic time!

There is also a dessert menu.  We shared a battered banana with ice cream.  I had green tea (my favourite), my husband had mango, and my brother had red bean (too sweet for me but my brother loved it).

The service was exceptionally friendly!  All the servers came by to say hi to my little guy :)  You'd think that in a place like this all the servers would be running around looking pissed off but there were enough servers to keep things under control on a Saturday night - with time to spare to coo at my little guy!  :)

LOOOOOOOVE this place!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am by no means a novice sushi-eater and I prefer going to small a la carte restaurants over buffets.  However, 168 is the only buffet I will go to.  Their menu is extensive and includes items that most other buffets omit (soft shell crab maki and handrolls are prime examples).  The staff are fast and food comes out as soon as it can.

They have been consistently adding things to their menu which now include several wok items and some dim sum (har gow and sui mai).  I tend to stick to the Japanese fare and lately I am loving their crispy unagi rolls (dinner only, on the second smaller order sheet).  

All in all, this place is a buffet so I don't expect the same quality of maki rolls as an a la carte but for a buffet, it is the best around the GTA."}
{"text":"love the food at 168 it is great love the private rooms and love that you can order as much as you want the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here tonight with family...Alright soooo Sushi+AYCE is probably not the best decision, but I'm quite sure there must be AYCE sushi spots that serve good quality fish and rice. I can't understand how Sushi restaurants like this establishment is able to serve such low quality fish. I mean, sushi has one main ingredient and I get skimping on the other ingredients but the main seller is the fish. Their presentation is great and the vegetarian fillings are fresh too. However the fish & rice used for the sushi rolls didn't taste buttery and rich, I couldn't taste what kind of fish I was eating TBH and washed it down with some flat coke. 
If you couldn't find Nemo, I may have eaten him unknowingly.
I probably won't return. Also they don't accept debit cards & only take credit cards, which is SO weird."}
{"text":"Services was fast and very friendly . The food was good and was brought to the table. The hot items came to the table hot."}
{"text":"I love 168 Sushi. The food is wonderful. They are friendly.

The only down fall is you dont always get what you order. You need to make sure you remember what you have ordered because they did bring me someone else's orders a few times."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Been here many times. Came here with my son and his friend and we always rave about the food quality and service. What's even better, you order with an iPad so you don't have to flag down the server to get your order in."}
{"text":"This place has free Wi-Fi, which is nice. They have iPads you can order on, which is convenient. Atmosphere is nice. Fish is decent quality, which is very important for all you can eat. Since I went on a weekend, the meal was pretty pricey - about 30$ a person. 

All in all, I would recommend this place to a friend. It's a nice place to eat, but it's nothing special."}
{"text":"I am seriously extremely confused by all of the reviews I have seen here on this place.  Went for weekend dinner, party of three.  Everyone was really hungry.   The rolls were absolutely awful. Way too much rice and were stuffed full of tempura bits.   You couldn't even taste the fish.   Which is probably a good thing because the sashimi was terrible.  Tiny pieces, tasted somewhat off, and had a fishy smell.  For weekend dinner, the selection of sashimi was very limited. Not that it matters, given then prior point on taste and smell.
One of the rolls had what looked like canned fish in it. I didn't even know sushi places kept canned fish. 

As positives, the service was fast and ordering off iPads was convenient, although you still needed a server to come by and confirm the order. Unfortunately the service wasn't enough to salvage an extra star after the terrible food and high price."}
{"text":"The few times I've been here, the food's been great. There's a wide selection available. The only downfall has been how slow the service was whenever I've gone."}
{"text":"Getting here around 12:30 PM on a Sunday required about a 25 minute wait. We left our number and they said they would send us a text when our table was ready. 

They have an ipad menu, like a lot of other ayce sushi places nowadays. There is a self serve bar which consisted of soups (clam chowder, miso soup, and wonton soup). You can also select your own amount of seaweed, green onions, and tofu bits, which I really liked. There was also a variety of salads (mango, seaweed, shrimp, crab and potato salad, and lettuce). Desserts like slices of cake, cream puffs, mango jello and mango yogurt, and strawberry and chocolate mousses were there as well. The best part was that you can make your own shaved ice. There were a variety of syrups and toppings. Syrups included lychee, peach, mango, and passion fruit. Other options were condensed milk and chocolate sauce. Toppings included red bean, brown sugar jelly, aloe, lychee jelly, green apple jello, mango jelly, strawberry jelly, and yogurt balls. You could go crazy with the shaved ice! Only for the ice creams and fried banana do you have to order on the ipad. 

The sushi in general was very good, the rice was sweet and soft, and the fish was fresh. In particular, I liked the white tuna sushi and the rainbow roll the best. There was a sweet sauce under the roll which completed the taste. The eel and cucumber hand roll was also delicious, with sweet eel and thinly sliced cucumbers. The beef short ribs were also very lean and worth ordering. 

Coming here for the second time since September 2015, they have definitely improved and stepped up their game. I was impressed with the food items and the service was very good. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Whoever answers the phone call in this place is so rude. I called to confirm my reservation and she said \"would you give me a second\" sounding annoyed, but I was not rushing her I was just stating the time and number of people that I have reserved for. She then told me no reservation was made and that on Sundays they do not take reservations. But I just made the reservation the day before with another girl that picked up the phone. Inconsistent."}
{"text":"The decor was good and I like the iPad option of ordering food, but the food itself was not so great. Ordered the maki platter and I can swear off sushi for a while. Appetizer, the sushi pizza and spring rolls were decent."}
{"text":"One of the few sushi buffet restaurants that everyone needs to try. 

Located south of Mississauga, very near the Oakville border, this sushi branch has been at this Dundas Street location for some time now. Just about a couple of years ago, it went through a massive renovation. Their interior design is a little on the dark side with several pot lights and fluorescent lighting that accents the purplish-pink decor throughout.

The food is mouth-watering as they carry all the sashimi, sushi rolls and makis and some Chinese and Korean dishes for all to enjoy. Before their renovations, they used to make their maki rolls equal to the size of bowling balls which made it very difficult to fit in your mouth and lessened your appetite to try other foods on the menu. They probably listened to some complaints and made their portions smaller with less rice inside their maki rolls. Now, portion sizes are much better and I can honestly say that all sushi and sashimi will melt in your mouth.

Notes:
* Watch out for the broken tiles and potholes in the parking lot before you enter the restaurant.
* Coincidentally they started using the Ipad menu system shortly after Heart Sushi opened their doors several years ago. When they used to have the old pen and paper system, our orders would be lost half the time.
* Tell the server that you are willing to pay cash and they will take 5% off the final bill.

{"text":"Poor on service and courtesy! Food nothing of special .. I use to go to 168 sushi buffet in sauga .. Never to change"}
{"text":"Worst customer service and management; Go at your own risk.

So, my family and I discovered this restaurant about 6 or so years ago and used to be regulars here until the management and staff were changed. Regardless, we decided to go last week for a family reunion to have a bit of a different seating arrangement than most other sushi restaurants. When we were done eating, the waitress had already added her amount of tip to the bill. (Not a restaurant rule) and until we started going over the bill, we didn't even notice it and there was no mention it otherwise...and when asked about it, her response was that she \" deserved that tip\". We went there again today, hoping to give this place a second chance and noticed that there's a 15 % surcharge added to each individual bill if you sit in the rooms as supposed to outside on the tables( at least that's what the sign says ) . When asked if he could sit outside instead, we were told by the manager that regardless of what the sign reads, we would still be charged the same surcharge . I'm not sure if they're trying to make more money by doing this because they aren't getting enough customers anymore or what their issue is but please save yourself some time and effort and MONEY by avoiding this restaurant and it's HORRENDOUS service . Their food isn't worth that much trouble."}
{"text":"Price & quality is ok. Plenty of options aside from just sushi (they had dim sum, thai food, etc. if you want variety). They also had a side table where you could get salads, crab legs, soups, etc. You use an ipad to order, and a server comes over to approve it. Unfortunately, the people that came to our table weren't very friendly and didn't look happy to be there. The waitress that got our bill to ring us up also wasn't very pleasant, but I suppose she also wasn't NOT pleasant? Just a bit rough."}
{"text":"I eat here allot. I am very picky about everything I eat, the service, cleanliness, etc.. And I LOVE 168 sushi! Everything is amazing. 

There is an amazing selection of food, it's all fresh and yummy! They are happy to customize things for you also. Even the sashimi (sp?) is soooo fresh! A must with raw ingredients. 

Not only do I love dinning in the restaurant. Main seating area or the private rooms (worth booking!) but I also get delivery from them regularly. I've always been happy with both! And if there is ever an issue they are so happy and accommodating to fix it. The staff and owners are beyond friendly!   

I recommend this place to friends, family, and my clients. I even hand out cards and menus lol it's just that good! 

Hope your enjoy it as well!

{"text":"This place is great. Maybe needs some renovation in comparison to other 168 Sushi locations, but the food quality is great here! The private rooms are super cute too, but only available for reservations."}
{"text":"The best 168 Sushi location. Has a great variety and great service. The food is always fresh and consistently good."}
{"text":"Bad service. I have been to different AYCE sushi restaurants for many times. This is the worst experience I have ever had. My friend and I went to this place for the first time last night. We are two girls and were not feeling full at all when we \"finished\" our dinner. Yes, our dinner was finished by the rude server. Won't be back because of the service."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi/sashimi by any stretch of the imagination, but a great place for AYCE sushi. For the price you pay, you definitely get your money's worth! Food can be hit and miss at times,but the sashimi is generally fresh and there is a good selection 

The wait staff is polite and attentive and food is served up quickly. They do Japanese well, but their Korean foods are iffy (with the exception of the Kalbi). If you're not a fan of Americanized-Chinese, I would steer clear from their new Chinese dishes that they introduced..."}
{"text":"[Service]
Unlike most reviews online I had excellent service. I went on a weekday at lunch time and it's not like it was empty, but the woman who greeted us gave us superb attention. She taught us how to use the Ipad ordering system and would follow-up on our requests. I'm sure it's a lot busier on the weekends but can't say that I have any complaints.

[Food]
I have a feeling that the food is catered to the non-asian population cause it kinda sucks LOL. Now let begin by saying the ordering system is awesome but when I went to get my miso soup (which is off to the side and it's self-served) I was not impressed that the seaweed wasn't in there. You can add toppings like tiny tofu and green onions but one sip and I knew...crap LOL. It had almost no flavour so maybe it got diluted.  I don't want to complain but I've had better luck making my own miso soup with pre-packaged powder from J-Town. Anyhow, there are lots of varities but the quality is average at best. The grilled dishes are a bit better, this includes the salmon. I actually don't remember how much it costed since I didn't pay lols, but my friends said it was worth it. For the quality, I would give it like a B-."}
{"text":"Five stars is not enough for this restaurant. Excellent food quality, great prices, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

These people honestly care about the customers experience and take pride in the food they prepare.

If I could, I would eat here every day!"}

{"text":"The place nice and clean, like the decoration and the staff were really friendly and serving with smile unlike other all you can eat sushi place in Mississauga .. the food quality was good as well the buffet is small of combination of Salad , Soup and craps legs .. the family had great time and defiantly we are coming back..it was around 30$ per adult with tax weekend dinner kids 13$ and kids under 5 free of charge."}
{"text":"I went there some time ago with a huge party, and I guess that should explain the \"blunt\" style of the waitress. However, the sushi and the sashimi was SO GOOD that it made it all worthwhile.

By the way, if you go there, for the love of God, just try something called \"MISSISSAUGA ROLL\". This is the only place I found that serves this kind of roll, which has salmon and cream cheese and is deep fried. It's called \"hot Philadelphia\" in Brazil, and it's AWESOME.

I guess if you arrive too late you will wait for a bit... the place seemed crowded after a while."}
{"text":"Well I forgot to write up my review yesterday when I had dinner here...so let's get started.

This is my usual go-to place whenever I wanted sushi as its all you can eat.  My hubby and I love the tempura mushroom sushi roll, which is why we always go to this place...usually for this.

The food here is pretty good for an AYCE, the kalbi that night was so tender and yummy.  I had 2 pieces of sashimi for every piece of fish they had and it was mediocre for me, it would have been nicer if it was a little colder for my liking.  It has a mix of Japanese, korean, Chinese and Thai food on the menu for the non sushi lovers, which are good as well.  We had fries udon noodles, kalbi, mushroom beef roll, deep fried tofu, vegetable tempura, fried cheese wonton, edamame, mushroom tempura, mushroom tempura roll, sashimi, salmon pizza, dynamite roll and pink lady roll...all good.

We also like going here because they have the private rooms where the table is on the floor and you sit on the floor but you can put your legs under the table almost like you're on chair as there's a hole in the floor.

The service here is pretty good.  They come around frequently to clean the finished plates off the table.  

The reason I have to give it 3 stars is that there's nothing really outstanding when it comes to the service, food, or atmosphere.  Just a good place to go to eat, get full and pay a decent price for it.  So can't really complain."}

Our server tonight was particularly rude. You can also constantly hear dishes loudly being thrown about. Menu iPads need to be washed. Spicy salmon sushi tasted incredibly strange. Never been to a sushi place that gets spicy salmon wrong. No wontons in the wonton soup. Everything down to the ginger tasted off. It's really too bad because this place used to be super."}
{"text":"Gross. Their sushi was OK and their stir fry was greasy and awful. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, I often order for delivery.. delivery sushi is super generous with their fillings btw, double the amount you get when you do ayce. I'd rather do ayce, not gonna lie, such a better price point.
Their sushi is always good, I love their beef dishes as well, especially black bean, and teriyaki steak. 
Their cheese wontons are awesome, and their mushroom tempura is yummy, too, crispy and not soggy at all. 
My favourite is really salmon sashimi, which is always great and delicious. Their fancy rolls are wicked too, but since I don't really go to eat with anyone who eats sushi, I can't order them cause the portions are too big for just me to eat LOL! 
Staff is good, they're always busy, and don't say much as per most sushi places. 
The inside of the restaurant is a weird colour, and layout, but that really doesn't matter to me at all."}
{"text":"Better then average ayce sushi buffet. So many variety dishes.  I don't think I can try every single dish once within one meal. Sashimi, nigiri and rolls are fairly good. They also arrange ur order nicely on the plate. There are several unique rolls that's worth trying.  Pops are free refill, which I like a lot. 

Their service is friendly and fast. All the orders come in a short time. Couple times though, they did miss part of my order and send other people's order to our table. Not a big deal since I will just order again or eat the other people's order if I like it. gg

Over all it's a nice restaurant to try. Beware, the restaurant is pretty busy during dinner time. Come early or u might need to wait for a bit. Reservation is available. Reserve ur seat if u got a big party."}
{"text":"Such great food! It's actually very surprising how delicious their food is. Service is fast, and I love the iPad menus. The only con for this restaurant is the fact it's very busy. I would recommend going before 12pm for lunch because around 1pm on weekend, there's is always about a 25 minute wait."}
{"text":"Just moved back to S'Sauga after about 3 years away and made my trip to 168 a top priority. 

For years the location was a very shady Chinese food restaurant. There were never any cars in the parking lot. I was a little nervous about how the decor would be but I was quite surprised when we walked in to find an airy and bustling dining room.

For AYCE sushi I would say the quality was high. The fish all seemed quite fresh (not frozen) and the food arrived promptly.  I've never seen such an extensive AYCE menu. We tried some of the curry dishes which we so-so. I think they may have had MSG in them...Or lots of corn starch to thicken the sauce....

If you want to stuff your face full of sushi delights, go here. And if you love pop, all you can drink pop is also included in the price. But why fill up on pop when you can eat lots and lots of sushi?? Ahhhh, so that is how they make money ;)"}
{"text":"It has been a while since last time I dined here... it looks like they did some renovation and jack-up the price on the all you can eat menu.

I don't recall them telling us of the salad bar when we sat down at the table. We learn the hard way as we asked the waitress for more wasabi... she just told us it available on the salad bar. (Aka \"go grab yourself\")... yes, apparently They do have a small salad bar with shaved-ice desert way in the back of the restaurant. It also has self-serve soup (wonton and sweet n sour). If you like seafood, they have crab legs and mussels. We didn't like it as the crab legs meat were hard to pull out. I don't understand why they cannot just add these options in the iPad menu... it is not a walk around type of all you can eat buffet. 

Sushi/Thai/dim sum Chinese menu are on iPad order. Foods arrived very fast... but cleaning up the empty plate were a little slow consider it wasn't that busy the time when were there. We decided to come here because of sushi options... but I find there is less sushi options but more of other variety of Asian dishes. 

I probably won't come back due to higher price than other sushi place. I can go without the crab legs and pay $10 less per person. I know there is another Japanese restaurant on Dundas with all you can eat salad bar bigger and more options. 

Sorry, no pictures this time, poor dishes display. Disappointed in service, sushi options and new price (not worth the extra $)."}
{"text":"Food is great, service too...I was surprised about the music playing....gangstas paradise .  Great song but not for place like this.  When I go for sushi, I prefer nice quiet music. Wouldn't recommend for romantic date, but good hang out place with some friends

...be cautious my fiance and I believe we may have gotten food poisoning from here .  The following day got really sick, narrowed it down to the sushi, as anything else we are others did too and they were fine."}
{"text":"Food is decent for the location this restaurant is in and what the restaurant looks like. I was meeting some friends for dinner and we picked a place between our two houses. This was the place. When we arrived, we realized it was in a run-down plaza in an area that wasn't so nice (never been to this part of town before) and wasn't sure we wanted to eat here but we gave it a try. Maybe our expectations were lowered but overall the menu has a good selection of food and came out as we can expected. Not the greatest sushi AYCE but decent enough. We ordered a good selection of Thai, Chinese and Japanese food. Food came out very fast and was hot. Not too busy for a Friday night so we had no trouble getting a table. I probably wouldn't come back as nothing stood out and it's not the greatest looking restaurant but if you're in the area and craving AYCE it's not a bad option. If you can afford an extra $10 per person (around $35 plus tax), though, I'd recommend going to Spoonful not too far from here."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends based on their recommendations.  I'll separate this review based on food and service because I think they both deserve some airtime.  

FOOD: The selection here is great.  They have your typical sashimi, sushi, rolls, hand rolls, appetizers etc., but also Korean food, Thai food, noodle soup, teppanyaki and dim sum.  They also have this amazing salad bar with AYCE crab legs and all sorts of salads (leafy, mango, potato etc.).  The best part though, they have the fruit jellies you can get instead of tapioca in bbt and the fruit bobas you get as a topping on froyo.  FOR FREE.  AND UNLIMITED.  I was ready to just grab four plates and top them off with jellies and bobas, but my friends wanted sushi.  Soft.  We told ourselves we'd limit the selection on our first round, but then went ham and ended up barely finishing what we ordered.  Yum.

SERVICE: Mehhhhh.  When we first entered the restaurant, we were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait, even though we could see several open tables.  Sure, maybe they're all reserved.  Nope.  After ~5 minutes of waiting, the manager directed us to a table that had been cleared and available when we arrived.  Whatever, minor inconvenience.  We placed our order, sent it in, and I'm not even exaggerating here, all of our food came within three minutes.  This might sound like a good thing, but it really wasn't.  We had ordered 20+ dishes with 200+ items and so when all of it came at once, there was literally not enough space on the table.  We had to put some of the food immediately on our plates so that they could make more space, but we still ended up having to balance some plates over the edge.  The incredibly annoying thing was that even after we had cleared up some of the food and were stacking the dishes on top of each other as an obvious sign that they needed to be cleared, no one came to clear them.  The manager and several servers walked by, saw the plates, and decided they had better things to do.  We eventually had to call someone over to clean things up.  Not impressed.

Not sure if I'll come back.  It's a bit pricier than other AYCE sushi places I frequent and the only advantage 168 has over those ones is the salad bar."}
{"text":"BEST buffet sushi place ever! I was a little skeptical coming here - only because it's really far for me (1.5 hour drive). It was my friend's birthday - so I really had no choice! But I'm so glad he chose this place, the food is amazing! The servers were so friendly, food came super fast and never once they got our order wrong. I'm so used to all you can eat sushi buffet they either don't come or they get our order all wrong. And this experience totally proved me wrong! I was the one that put in the order wrong... I ended up ordering 6 orders of spicy salmon instead of 6 PIECES of spicy salmon. Yes that means we had 30 rolls of spicy salmon at our table between 5 people to finish. 

Luckily, we are big eaters and yes we finished all of the rolls I ordered. (thank god!) Their desserts were also to die for! I love their mango pudding! We ordered 15 of them. The server was very kind to double check the order to make sure we wanted 15. 

The place is also very well lit and very spacious. I love how they have the privacy of each table, you get a little booth where you take off your shoes and you get to sit inside. I haven't seen this anywhere! 

Well worth the drive for me. I would love to take my parents here!"}
{"text":"Not as pricy as the other sushi places, no wonder why their quality isn't of the best either. Service is good, decor is good too. However if you want to order take out, it is really pricy."}
{"text":"Update: July 22, 2015

The food as usual is outstanding. Service was quick and easy. The food was hot and well made for the most part. I noticed a few changes this time around.

The scallops in the shell which was previously done with a cream sauce now sits under a mountain of lava hot mayo. The garlic steak cubes was overcooked and the mushroom beef soup lacked all flavour. 

Still - it's worth it to come to this restaurant. 99% of the food is incredible and fresh."}
{"text":"Stale, frozen, burnt, flavourless, pedestrian. Rude staff, rude customers, ugly restaurant. This place needs to be condemned."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch .. Good food , good service... And lots of vegetarian sushi option would come again   !!"}
{"text":"The sushi is absolute great here!  They have a huge menu with a lot of selection.  It's a good ambiance for a friday night dinner.  The service is good.  The only thing that is lacking is no Ika (Squid) roll, which is one of my fav's!  Everything else from the tempura, sashimi, and sushi is very good.  Unlimited free refills.  Yum Yum!

The price can be said to be a bit high, but it is a great place.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"To-go place for AYCE sushi in Mississauga. Price is around what you can expect, though there is a small discount for cash payment. There's a good variety of rolls and sushi, as well as a slew of non-sushi items for the squeamish ones in your party. 

The stuff here tends to be hit and miss. Their sashimi is usually decent, as well as the sushi, but their tempura batter is much more variable. I've had both light and flaky panko batter and thick, dense, oily stale batter, so beware! I would also avoid most of their non-sushi items as a rule, because they tend to be very average at best and you really shouldn't come here for them. 

All in all, a perfectly decent ayce sushi place."}
{"text":"I arrived 5 minutes before last call. The greeter was wiping down a table when I arrived. She continued cleaning while telling me that I could seat myself in a private room. 

The first dishes ordered via their iPad menu arrived within 5 minutes. The sake was quickly served. 

My only complaint: few fruit flies in the private room. 

Presentation of the food was great however. I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The food here is decent prices are fair but there are better places. The booth option is Definitely the best part. The problem here is the friendliness, no smiles, no greeting, never asked how we were or if we needed refills. An overall angry attitude and don't know why"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan and would visit almost every week. This is actually where I fell in love with sushi after a friend brought me here. Unfortunately, the last time I was here the food was just horrible and unacceptable. I'm not sure if quality is no longer a priority or there are different chefs now but I will never come back. Judging from previous reviews, it seems this place has taken a huge nosedive into the ground."}
{"text":"I have been there about 3 times and loved it every time. Being a vegetarian there were lots of choices and the waiter and chef were helpful to make a veg option for  us. Lunch buffet is best value."}
{"text":"average food. but then again you can't find a decent ayce sushi in sauga. 3 star because it's better than yes sushi ...."}
{"text":"The nigiri is unexceptional and the neta portions almost stingy. The maki and handrolls range from awesome to merely good -- crunchy, spicy and gunboat rolls are an expected highlight. The tempura is hit and miss (shrimp and yams = yum, squid and mixed veggies = blah) and the wok/korean items are food court calibre. The Sake is pricey, even an average Hakutsuru draft. There's not a ton of variety of Sushi per se, although the dinner menu ups the ante a little bit. 

Yet, I LOVE this place.

How do I explain this? It's that magic combination of $15 lunch/$25 dinner AYCE Sushi, a clean bright and nicely renovated space, casually asian vibe (clean bandit and PSY not worn out tape of ersatz flute and harp music) and attentive but not hanging-off-you-for-a-tip servers -- there are few things I hate worse than an AYCE place with staff trained to hard-upsell you on beverages.

And iPads. 

Yes, iPads. As silly gimmicks go, I am a sucker for ordering things when I can see pretty pictures of them. And when it comes to AYCE I like to make sure my eyes aren't bigger than my stomach before I order. I love tapping the iPad to see which items I've ordered so far. It's fun and completely irrational. 

And whenever I'm in the 'sauga, I return. Again and again."}
{"text":"Have been there numerous times for lunch and as a vegetarian / vegan family only lunch makes sense. The dinner extras and price are all for seafood or meat options and thus for us, lunch works. And this is the only buffet we go to in the last 5+ years. 

The lunch options for vegans and vegetarians are good. The service is good, but I took some points away for either the wait staff don't speak clear English (their vocabulary, I find is limited) and also not being knowledgeable about some of the dishes. Does it contain any fish sauce or meat items?, does the soup contain fish or meat broth? - questions asked such as these and they are lost and answer them inconsistently from one to another. 

In the last year or so, they have moved the soups, salads and some desserts to a self serve table. Don't like that. In my opinion it should be all or nothing. 

As it is we visit this place at most once a year. But if you crave sushi, it is a decent place to go."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of quality all you can eat.  Don't go here if you're looking for that.  The service was slow.  The food was bland and clumsy.  The sushi quality was average at best.  The staff couldn't describe the various sushi's and the menu didn't help much either.

Poultry quality was suspect.  Beef was under marinated and very fatty.

Selection is decent, but i don't think i'll be coming back to this establishment.  There are far better all you can eat in the GTA."}
{"text":"To be completely honest I already posted a review on Yelp about 168 Sushi and it wasn't the greatest review under the sunshine. However, I recently gave them another chance and I regret pouring out $20 on that buffet. The only awesome thing is the Ipad, Yes I love the idea. Its easy to order from, but the waiter still has to come by and approve the food before it could be served. When I went there it was extremely packed but the wait time was not too bad. I was disappointed with the service, the waiter was never around nor did he particularly seemed to care whether or not the sushi was good. Well it was kind of meh...not the greatest I ave ever had. I felt like the ingredients were not fresh and they kept messing up the order. I understand you are out of something but if you are then please let the customer know. The whole point is that if you wanna have a less hectic and more accurate service try sushi sushi in Mississauga or other Sushi buffets."}
{"text":"Another AYCE Japanese/Chinese/Thai/etc. restaurant is always welcome. However, there was nothing about the food to distinguish it from any other AYCE place. Everything was just OK.  Even though some of the selections sound interesting and actually look good on the menu, in reality they were disappointing and the portions were small in comparison to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Okay that one star take it as a negative. So far worst sushi restaurant i had even been too. Hey! owner of this restaurant. Go back to basics, reevaluate what you are serving, it sucks. The sushi rice were worse then even steamed rice at your cheap local asian restaurants. If you can't even get the basics like the rice right, how can you expect your food to be good? I shall not be back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Everything you're looking for at an AYCE joint. They have a good amount of variety on most menu items, although, ironically their sushi selection is a bit limited. I went on a Wednesday night and the place was fairly busy, which made it challenging to flag down our waiter after placing an order on the iPad. I had a few drinks, and they were well made although maybe a little overpriced. 
Overall: 
Food 8/10
Atmosphere 10/10 
Service 6/10"}
{"text":"Great place.  The new decor is cool and the fact that you do all your ordering from an ipad is a great idea.  Service is fast and food is great.  Been here multiple times never had any complaints and food has been great."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with my wife and step daughter. Friendly and fast service. iPad menus and ordering system was fun and easy, prices were responsible and portions are a good size. We chose to eat a la carte not ayce and it was still worth it. I would happily recommend this restaurant to any dinning a la carte or all you can eat provided you have a good apatite it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a buffet dinner the other night. first off, ambiance in the restaurant is very nice! Looks very trendy and modern with the decor styles used. A number of seating options including booths which is nice. 
As per typical AYCE sushi restaurants, you are given a tablet to search and pick through the menu options. They offer a variety of foods - sushi/sashimi, meats, rice/noodles etc. What was a bit different from the norm is that they have a salad and soup station at the back of the restaurant for you to choose from (rather than offering it on the tablet). I also like that their sushi rolls are only 4 pieces at a time - gives you more opportunity to try more flavours/styles without being wasteful.

Very good quality food, and really the trendy atmoshphere!"}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago hoping to take my mom out for a nice lunch but the service was very rude. We politely put our hands up to order food and were told in a condescending manner that we shouldn't do that (not \"you dont have to\",but they were giving us orders).  Two waitresses came and told us that.  

So we said we are going to leave, and then the manager asked what was wrong.  I told him they were very rude to us and treated us like little kids and then he said \"OK' , bye\".  

No apology or anything.  This place used to be very good but now its nothing.  Go next door to Miga or Spring rolls to be treated like an adult."}
{"text":"This is my third AYCE in the GTA, after Heart Sushi (found coincidentally in Heartland) and August 8 in Hamilton.
And unlike my past visits, this was the first time I had come with my dad...who has never tried AYCE before :P.
The place looks quite nice from inside...nice dim lighting. 
Service is very quick and the items come quite fast
They too have the iPads but ordering is a bit different..after you decide upon the items, you have to call the waiter and then they will send the order...delays things slightly but they rotate around frequently enough that it's not a problem.
Thankfully, the hand rolls and sushi come as a single pieces which means that as two people, you can order a few more items. 
Sushi rolls are well prepared, not an excess of rice. 
They have a nice \"salad bar\", where you can pick up seaweed and ginger and wasabi, allows for good personalization. 
Huge menu, probably one of the larger in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad even for a sushi place (they're generally all pretty bad). I've been here many times and so many things we ordered simply never showed up. Also not the type of place where anyone will ever check to see how things are ever.

The sushi is alright. Meh. This place isn't exactly inexpensive and the food is mediocre, the service is below average, and the decor/atmosphere is pretty ugly even after renovations. 

I wouldn't specifically avoid it for any reason but there are much better options."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way.. from writing your orders on a piece of paper and not usually getting them to now having the Inday menu where you can see the dish see what's inside of it.. this is going to be my new place to go to for sushi as their prices are very reasonable for lunch and dinner cause I know alot of places now charge a 4 year old (my son is 4) 9$, and they charge 5$ they know that most kids at that age don't eat at much so they make their prices perfect for the age bracket..

When it comes to the food they made a big jump the on the taste factor they have improved alot since going there in 2010 onwards..

They have really nice and friendly staff and their service is really quick and they make sure their customers are taken care of and not being neglected. .

Like I said earlier this is going to be my new go to place for AYCE sushi.."}
{"text":"Just found this place and the food was delish. Served quickly, hot and fresh. Service was very good would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"On May 15 we had dinner at this place and my whole family got food poisoned. Including 2 toddlers. Now we all vomiting and frequent washroom runs. All nauseous fever and stomach pain.
During dinning I also received a plate of sushi toll with bad source. 

Please serious. Check you food safety.  You are serving seafood which can cause serious danger to people

{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to Brampton from the Niagara region and have been attempting to find our new \"sushi place\". These attempts had led us to try out 168 sushi and their lunch menu. I have to say so it was a disappointment. We went there, ordered teriyaki, noodle soup, tempura, sushi rolls and nigiri and almost none of it stood up to par. First the noodle soup, both the Tom yum and seafood noodle had no flavour. The yam tempura was not actually deep fried in tempura batter but instead in a thick batter that tasted processed, or chemical and the deep fried scallops we ordered didnt taste fresh. The seaweed salad was warm and slightly mushy. The sushi and nigiri selections were not as grand as promised and in fact most tasted quite either dry, mushy (again) or we could not find the one we were looking for. Towards the end, I ordered ice cream and when I got my bowl there was a caked on piece of ... \"green\" thing? 

On the positive side, we did actually enjoy some of the things we ordered. The beef dumplings were delicious, the beef teriyaki was amazing and the salmon nigiri was pretty good.

In the end the overall food wasn't the best. Maybe we just ordered all the things that they couldn't make right but it didn't turn out good anyways and left a bad taste in our mouths. If you are thinking of going to a sushi place and location is stoping you from going too far just go instead to the JCT fusion restaurant down the street at Kennedy square. They might not have what you want on paper, but when asked they will definitely make it for you."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but the quality of food has gone down drastically! Since when did spicy salmon roll start having big chunks of onions?? The sashimi pieces a really tiny. The chicken teriyaki came dry. And to top it off, the service was crap."}
{"text":"This was the first place I went to when I first had sushi all those years ago, I never forgot about it because it was such a fond memory.

I remember having to use the paper to actually place an order, but what I also loved was the private rooms and all the memories my friends and I shared when we first came here. It was amazing.

All of the food was made wih such care and it all tasted really really good. And from what I can see now I believe they have a system to place the order? Or could I be wrong?

This place is situated in a store front hidden behind a building down kennedy road so you really have to look out for it!

Definitely would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try sushi for the first time!"}
{"text":"First and foremost I just want to mention that I work here, so I know the ins and outs of this place. That being said, I will give this place a non biased 4/5 (3.5 if that were an option)

To everyone that has been wronged by this restaurant, I apologize on their behalf. Most of the low ratings seem to have been incurred through the low quality service received. I cannot give a rating here because I would most definitely be biased on this part; I know each and every waitress, and each individual is a delight as a person.  However, due to the nature of this restaurant - almost always busy when you want to go - they are more often than not burdened with more responsibilities than they can handle. Please go easy on them; a kind customer is more likely to receive kind service than a rude one.

In terms of food, I will say this place is either a hit or a miss. Many of their items are fantastic! Their sashimi is always great, and their deluxe rolls are amazing. Many of the kitchen items are delightful (avoid the beef teriyaki. However, if you're going for dinner, try the teppanyaki beef cubes - way better). Out of all the AYCE sushi buffets, this place has the best cream cheese wontons. Their standard rolls are not up to snuff compared to their other items (personally too much cucumber waters down the overall taste). Also their spicy salmon roll (the roll I use to gauge quality) is slightly below average.

A big plus is that the food comes out almost instantly. Also having an iPad menu is great.
A big minus is that it is always busy during prime time. if you can, possibly go during the dead hours. 

As an employee here, I am obliged to return here often.
As a customer, this is one of my top choices for AYCE sushi. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Totally blech.  Worst sushi I think I've ever had in Canada.  I don't even know where to begin ... food that tasted like it was thrown in a microwave, tuna that came out of a can, rice on the sushi rolls that looked like had the consistency and color of discolored cheese.  Dishes that tasted almost identical to the next one.  Never again.  Note to the business: even if it requires paying a few workers another hour to stay later, don't start cleaning in full view of customers while they're still eating. If it's not for how tacky that feels, you don't want customers witnessing the pros and cons of your cleaning technique...

As a followup here, went to another restaurant (Yame Sushi in Oakville), and it just blew 168 away in terms of freshness and taste. Night and day. Exact same price, 10 minutes away, and you see what incredibly high quality sushi is.  168 has to work on their freshness, presentation, and adjust their profit margin a bit to increase their quality."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for AYCE sushi, with our 6 year old son in tow, food is consistent and there is a lot to choose from. And not just sushi, there are some Thai, dim sum, Korean type dishes as well. So a lot of variety. Service is often rushed and not always the friendliest (but no one has ever been rude) but for this kind of resto, it doesn't spoil the meal."}
{"text":"I love sushi...and ayce is often great value.
Here my favorite was the crispy beef. Not an ideal answer in a sushi spot. Service was patchy but OK. The rolls were ok but bland. Nothing really unique or bad but for a 30 dinner it should be a bit better.  I probably wouldn't be back with so many other options locally but won't argue against it either."}
{"text":"Food came very fast!
We loved the salmon chip!"}
{"text":"Modern contemporary decor. Ordering, calling server, requesting the bill from an Apple iPad. 21st century is finally embraced. 

I first heard about this place from a co-worker of mine 2.5 years ago, I've been a happy returning customer since. 

Meats and fish are fresh (maybe a 2 or 3 days old). 

The menu selection is big. You will find a picture of everything, aren't good with names, no worries - this picture-book iPad menu will take care of ya. 

Service is quick, staffing is organized is a way so that everything is done correctly during peak hours. 

Price is fair. 
I didn't find it obscure for an all-you-can-eat. You get what you pay for. 

I enjoy this place a lot. Will always return. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Location
Along an industrial strip on Dundas, it's a standalone restaurant with private parking. The interior is simple, modern and clean. Reserve a day before to guarantee seating as it gets busy during the weekends. 

Service
Free wifi. Friendly and attentive servers. You choose meal items using an iPad app, and after placing your order, your server comes to get it going. We got a little excited and ordered almost 50 items split between 7 people, but the server was smart enough to taper our order and avoid having to roll us out in a barrel with our expanded tummies!

Food
Extensive AYCE menu that includes sushi and sashimi, Japanese grilled items, Korean Bbq, Thai and Singapore food. The desserts are pretty good too, and they had my fave mango yogurt cups! 

We came on a weekday and forked over $25.99/adult ($11.99/kids). For the quality and selection, it's worth going for a big meal."}
{"text":"For $20 this place was awesome. Went here for dinner and I'm glad I did because as a beginner when it comes to sushi, I only really like the salmon and cheese rolls and they only have cheese rolls on their dinner menu. I didn't venture out and try anything else really lol! But I went kind of wild on the dessert. The icecream was amazing, the asian version of Kawartha Dairy. It was the best ice cream I've had at a sushi place (which is pretty damn good!). My dad doesn't eat sushi so he ordered things that were cooked and he and my family enjoyed it. 

The deep fried milk was yummy, the deep fried banana was yummy, and the salmon sushi and ice cream were delightful! And it's all you can eat. 
I'm sure I'll be back again.
:)"}
{"text":"I come here sometimes with friends or family.

I like that they have a diverse all you can eat menu.  They are also the first restaurant I've been to that uses a digital menu on a tablet (Very cool!).  Because of this, you can easily see pictures of what the food looks like before you order it.

There tends to be a long wait on weekends, and for dinner.  I would call ahead and make a reservation if they allow it.

For some reason I tend to get stomach aches after eating here, but I don't know if it's just me and the mix of too much raw fish and ice cream.

The waitresses are usually pretty friendly as well."}

{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in Mississauga for years! The iPad menu is brilliant, no worrying about ordering too many rounds. Atmosphere is very nice and fish is also pretty fresh. My favourite is the whole grilled mackerel (1 person can finish one easy) and the salmon rose. There's also a self serve shaved ice machine that kids just love. The mango cup desserts and ice cream are great, cakes are mediocre though. 

Selection is great, food is good, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and showed up just before noon. The place was packed! Lots of tables of people apparently on their lunch breaks.

Service was fast, food was good, and no annoying birthday music! As for the bathrooms, I chose not to check them out this time around. :)"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years on occasion and they went from a traditional bland looking place to a more \"modern\" restaurant now with more seating... and also a step up is that you can order from their ipad which has the menu on it as opposed to writing it down on a piece of paper like they used to before.

Honestly, I only like three things from this place.. their fried chicken noodle, their tempura (not the best but I like it anyway), and chicken teriyaki roll. The rest of the menu is okay, but their tasty in their own way and its a matter if personal preference. 

I suggest going here with a reservation, it doesn't matter if your going on a weekday or weekend.. just make that reservation because theres a chance that this place will be busy during lunch time. JUST DO IT. 

Dinner time is always less chaotic but the place is sometimes filled with people on a random and you would have to wait for awhile if your unlucky.

Overall its a good place to take your spouse, friends, co-worker, and family here as they also accommodate large groups. Staff is okay, very attentive as usual."}
{"text":"This place did what many others over the years failed to do at the same location - have a successful sushi restaurant. And they did SO well, they triggered a run of new sushi restaurants all across Brampton while at the same time expanding their business to multiple locations (making their name a little odd since the name 168 was based originally on their address on Kennedy Rd. in Brampton).

The sushi is fresh and delicious. The sashimi is presented in good-sized chunks, and there's a broad selection of sushi rolls to choose from. The hot foods are rich in flavor and served in relatively small portions, but since it's AYCE you just order more.

Recommended items include the baby mushroom beef rolls, beef in black bean sauce, salmon belly, miso soup, and seaweed salad. For desert, the milk pudding is creamy good but might on occasion be undercooked leaving the center cool rather than warm.

This is our go-to sushi place!"}
{"text":"The fucking restaurant is bad the fish smell bad and the abogado was black I call then to let them know and they say ok ok ok repitting the same then over and over. Like they didn't really care so the restaurant is fack and Oslo have cucarachas."}
{"text":"Definitely a winner. Private rooms are a pleasant bonus. Food is great, flavourful and delicious. Staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about products. Their plum wine is my favorite drink and accompanies their sashimi and sushi wonderfully. Will continue to return."}
{"text":"So I've been to the 168 in Mississauaga and it's decent infact it's pretty decent ....
so I figured hey let's try this one here in Brampton !
What a mistake I made !!!!
I should have known when I walked in and the place looked like it was in major need of an face lift
But whatever look past the decor right !!!
Well we sit down and the table is all wet , I ask the waitress for a napkin to wipe down the table and she hands me 1 small napkin real classy !!
Anyways the food is mediocre at best ! The quality is not great the service is pretty terrible aswell .
So my suggestion is go elsewhere !"}
{"text":"I ate here last night and had a great experience. 
Food was great very fresh and great selection .
Atmosphere was warm and very sheik ...service was very good and surprisingly fast ....I truly would and will come back . And recommend you try it ."}
{"text":"Lunch is decently prices, dinner is overpriced for selection. Food is ok and staff has ranged from excellent to absolutely horrible (your luck I guess). Recommended, but be its your luck with the staff you get."}
{"text":"This place has gone down in service. It appears to be under new management and this is the 3rd conservative time we have had bad service. The food is still similar but not the same. It's like they don't want to staff the restaurant properly. The other 168 franchise have up it game. Gone with ipads and we'll staffed."}
{"text":"We came here for a family lunch with my husband, brother-in-law and parents. We came for 12:30pm on a Sunday and thankfully we didn't have to wait but while we were eating, the place filled up and as we were leaving people were waiting. This place is known for the line-ups so keep that in mind when planning to come here.

Food: First of all, there is a soup and salad bar at the back of the restaurant. I think this is a great idea because it makes the service a little bit faster because they don't have to make and serve the simple stuff. I had miso soup on this day and I thought it was pretty good. I wish it had the requisite seaweed pieces but I still enjoyed it. 

We had never been here for lunch before but we thought the selection was decent. As with other similar places, there is no sashimi or torched salmon for lunch. I had my usual chicken wings (great!) and salmon sushi. The salmon itself was fantastic. Not at all chewy. The rice was interesting. I thought it had an almost sweet quality to it. I've recently become a fan of sesame balls and on this trip I really enjoyed them. 

They also have a dessert section in the back where they have the usual mousse/custard/cake. Unfortunately, I'm sad to report that they got rid of my cappuccino mousse cake. It was my favourite dessert! I'm not sure if it's available during dinner though. As for the ice cream, those are still available on the iPad.

Service: Not as attentive as my last visit here but there wasn't a delay when we put our orders through. The food came in a timely manner and there were no double orders. 

Overall experience: I thought it was okay overall. These places tend to be a bit on the pricey side and the food quality isn't the greatest. I think for the future I will stick with dinner even though it's a bit more expensive. 

Cost: $19.95 per person + tax + tip"}
{"text":"We purchased two of their vouchers for 2 people on a group deal website, and have used one of them so far and were quite pleased with it.  

The service was acceptable and the food only took a while for a few items.  I remember liking the tempura items, salmon, shrimp, and even the bulgogi which was my first time having it was very tasty.  

HOWEVER when I sat down the waitress was trying to hard to sell me a Sapporo beer which I accepted to and now I understand why -- it cost 9 DOLLARS!  Not even kidding, the can of Sapporo that costs 2.95 in the LCBO was $9 here.  I understand they gotta make a profit but come on, really..  It's almost criminal to be charging that...  I guess that's how they make up for their lost money on those Group Buy deals so just a warning to stick with the pop!  Had to take an extra star away for that unfortunately"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Sushi Buffet in such a long time. But i can re-call about my last visit.  My friend and i decided that we should come here to eat for lunch and as usual it was packed. We got seated right away and i like how we can choose where we sit if the table was available; even though it was packed. When we got seated, the server asked if we wanted a drink - at least by then that was a quick service to get our drinks. For the meanwhile when my friend and i were waiting for the drinks, the server handed the ipad menus. I think that was really cool; i didn`t really know how to use it (i know, im a technology geek but couldn`t figure out how to use the ipad menu?) so i had my friend to do all the wanting on the menu.  We first ordered appetizers.  I must say that their cream cheese wontons were sooo good! I had at least 2 sets of orders of those creamy cheese wontons.  Then it came to the sushi - we had a few of the sashimi but the most favourite one that i really liked was the mackerel.  They served it freshed! Well at least i know that they did. 

While ordering some Sushi, i was craving for something with soup, i guess that's probably because i had pho withdrawals (if that even make sense?). Anyways, i ordered a beef soup and when it came in...it was a small portion than i thought, but it came to my surprise that as i was looking at the beef....there was HAIR on it. I wanted to yack so i put the soup aside and didn't even bother touching the rest of it. I could not remember if i had told the server what happened but other than that im pretty sure that i gave them at least only $1 tip.  I was still disgusted though. The employees who works behind the bars should've at least worn hair nets. 

I come back to this place sometimes for lunch and yes, they're pricey!! But i guess you get what you pay for right?  I give them 3/5 for over-rall - i mean there are other SUSHI BUFFET that are much better than this BUFFET."}
{"text":"I used to eat here quite often. I really like their booths, but they frequently tell you they are reserved if you ask for one. Then you'll sit there and eat your meal and watch how nobody is eating in the booths. It's really weird. It's like they are saving it in case Jet Li walks in or something. 
The food is decent, is prepared quickly and tastes great. 
The location is sketchy, lock your car. Lol"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi and not many selections. The rolls are filled with too much rice and the tempura is filled with batter. The sashimi list is missing soo many great potential choices.

Not worth the price you pay for AYCE. You might as well go downtown and pay the same and get more choices and healthier options."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who were very accommodating. 
We went for dinner and I must admit, it was on the pricier end at $27 (before tax and tip) on a weekday. Nonetheless we all had a good meal and a good time. Fish is fresh and surprisingly good quality for an ayce. Sashimi was nice and thick, served on ice too if you ordered a lot."}
{"text":"Pretty decent all-you-can-eat sushi spot. Quality is mediocre, but it's what you would expect at a buffet. They've got a good variety of traditional sushi fare, as well as lots of grilled and steamed alternative options for non-fish eaters in the group. Good vegetarian selection as well. 

You place your orders on an iPad, so it's fairly easy if you've got a smallish group. 

Quality is so-so. Rice on the sushi is crumbly and some times falls apart when dipping in soy sauce. Galbi beef is delicious, but it's incredibly fatty. 

Salads, wasabi, and pickled ginger are at the salad bar at the back of the restaurant, so you can help yourself while your order is being made. 

I come all the time with co-workers for lunch, and it satisfies our sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Cool place and everyone is nice and good service and the menu is on a iPad so that's cool and the food is good and fresh . High recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"Talk about a huge improvement!! I haven't been here since the renovation and partly because I got really sick eating here 4-5 years ago. Since it's been that long and the ratings on yelp got better, we decided to give it a try.

**IPAD MENU**

Went here on a Monday night and we didn't have to wait.
they sat us right away! Customer service was quick and friendly. Decor is a big step up from the last time I was here. I also noticed that they have a serve yourself salad bar/desserts/snow cone ish thing going on. I was very intimidated to turn on the ice crusher machine and I didn't know if I was doing it right. Salad was plain. Nothing special. You can also make your own Miso soup.

Top dishes: crispy beef and chicken, takoyaki, garlic beef cubes, thai chicken balls, sashimi on pringles looking chips, scallops and the bbq torched sushi

Check out the grilled stuff and new items. Their sushi was buttery and fresh!

I would go back here again."}
{"text":"Make reservations!  It will save you agony and stress, not to mention intense jealousy and hunger.  We went on a Saturday evening and the place was packed!  The decor is decent and you order using an iPad.  Some of the more common/traditional appetizers can be found in a small buffet like area at the back.  Everything was super fast paced, including the music that was playing.  It's all about getting you in and out as quickly as possible.  The staff were helpful, but very busy.  Keep in mind that after you make your selections for the all you can eat, you need to press call server and wait for someone to come around and send your picks off to the kitchen.  This process may take a while depending on how busy it is.  Food generally arrived very quickly and were good.  Was a good experience, probably won't return of my own volition in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday around 11:30 AM, and it wasn't busy. We were seated promptly and the server was friendly and helpful, showing us how to use the iPad menu, as it was our first time using it. We ordered a number of dishes, and the food arrived right away. For the service and promptness, I'd give this place a 4/5. However, the food itself is nothing to write home about, and drops my rating down to nothing but an average experience. The tempura batter was soggy, the edamame was undercooked, and the short ribs were bland. The sushi itself was average. If you're looking for an AYCE experience where the food itself is something you would come back for, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"168 is the most consistent sushi buffet. Service is good, food is delicious,  fast and great variety to choose from. I've been here countless time and was never disappointed once. Brought friends and family there a few time and they all loved it."}
{"text":"A good place for fresh and delicious sushi. The service is also very fast!!

We went there on a Wednesday afternoon, and I was surprised to see the place was totally filled, even on a weekday afternoon!! The servers are very attentive and polite. Good food with good customer service."}
{"text":"Baby maggot on the table. Hair in my bread and soup. Very fast service but, Stale food. Not entirely sure what the rave about it is. Decided to try it again after 5 years, but there's a reason I don't come here...left with my stomach in knots... (they're also not shy to ask for their tip... rudely)"}
{"text":"It's awesome and really cheap. You won't have a downtown cheap AYCE sushi dining experience.. It's fancy and awesome... 

They have ipads for menus and service is really fast. Go there on a empty stomach and make sure you reserve in advance.. People never stop coming in through that door"}
{"text":"By far one of the worst sushi restaurants I've ever been to. The beef and momo's had a burnt aftertaste. The miso soup was plain water with some sprinklings of seasoning which I'd just left. Must've had half their sushi menu. 

For a sushi restaurant the rice used for the sushi was absolute horrible. No tannin, no flavour. The tempura had like everything else absolute no taste or flavour. The sushi itself was decent but ruined by the terrible rice. The BBQ salmon / tuna was unpalatable as was the fly fish egg roll. The sashimi didn't have a fresh feel to it. It was just nowhere near what it should be. The ice cream had icicles in it. To top it all off the bowl for the sashimi had a large chip broken off in it. 

The chicken schehwan and chilli chicken were indistinguishable from each other. The Tao chicken was an absolute horror considering how hard it was. 

The only reason this has one star is due to the fact that the service was pretty quick and efficient. The pickled ginger and plain water were the best two things on the menu. Never going back, much rather Prince Sushi in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Buffet and Japanese food have always been a bad combo in my book.  What that meant was food was all about quantity and not so much on quality.  Was pleasantly surprised with this place.   For the price, the hand rolls are pretty good but don't expect any maguro or otoro.  Always packed which is a good sign for a sushi place.  That means the food turnover is quick and fresh."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say this is not my first time at the Dundas 168, but my most recent experience here was absolutely appaling. When we went in, my family and I were greeted by whom we believe either the manager or owner. As he directed us to the tables I asked him if we can get a booth instead, but he rudely brushed my off saying that their booth can only hold max 4 people. That is total bull because in the past we have sat in a large booth in the back of the restaurant that holds 8 people. 

After my family and I began to order and the food began to arrive, we noticed that some items have been changed, and not for the better. The takoyaki was halved and extremely dry, and the chicken fried rice was extremely oily. Other than that, the sashimi and sushi dishes were great like always.

Nevertheless my family and I had a great time, but unfortunately what was initially delight for one of our go-to restaurants turned sour when our waitress came by toward the end of our meal. Apparently she saw me take a sip of my sister's iced tea (I only got a water) and became extremely upset telling me that there is a stern policy of not sharing drinks, and told me she would have to charge me for an extra drink. I was absolutely horrified that any individual or establishment would condone a customer of sharing a drink with their own family member. I thought about letting the manager know of this situation, due to the fact that we were a party of 5 spending well over $150 and they're telling me I can't have a sip of non-alcoholic iced tea? But judging by the manager's piss ass attitude when he was greeting us I doubt it'll do any good. 

Now the food here is great and $25 dollar per person is very reasonable. However, food services is not just the food but the service as well. Other 168s have much better service with the same if not greater quality of food.

Therefore, my advice is that if you are ONLY looking to fill your tummy and don't give a crap how you are treated then this is the place. But if you don't want to be criminalized for taking a sip from your friend/family's drink then avoid this place like a plague, there are countless other sushi buffets."}
{"text":"I adore sushi and can easily say that this restaurant chain has an amazing buffet. The service is efficient, the size of sushi and rolls is not decreasing (all items have gotten drastically smaller at the branch on Steeles) and overall atmosphere is decent. The only negative comment for this branch that I can think of is that the salad bar is lacking many items that again, are present at the other locations. Additionally, I've noticed the cost for both lunch and dinner buffet increasing rapidly."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to! The dining area had a very fun atmosphere, with a lounge like feel and upbeat music. Service was very attentive, keeping our water filled and helping us with our orders if needed. I loved the iPads as menus, it made ordering a lot faster and with a large group everyone could pick what they wanted easily. The food also came out fast. Some of the dishes were hit and miss. The korean chicken and vegetable pad thai were not great however most of the rolls and appetizers were good. Milk pudding for dessert was delicious. $25 for dinner seemed reasonable given the quick service as most AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to certainly take their time. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"i would not come back! 
i love sushi,  my sister in law took me in once. it was ok, food came fast and taste fine. but the second time i went , sushi was  not really that good. deep fried roll is cold or just room temp, that tasted horrible!
sashimi was ok, rolls not impressive. i would not recommend !"}
{"text":"I love this place! Lots of selections! The cook foods are good!!  I order chicken and beef skewers, fry noodles, beef , fish. Don't order the egg plant, bland! The sushi is amazing! Fishes are so fresh and rice won't fall apart! But their rolls on the other hand  are mediocre . Too much rice , too much sauce. Service is hit and miss , but the ladies to actually carry the food to our table are really nice , not the waitress. iPad order always have to wait for the waitresses to come to confirm, it's annoying.That's why I took one star. But I still like it! Recommend to go"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on family day to get some sushi. I liked the fact that they have iPads that you can order from and that you can see what you still have coming. The portions were large enough for 5 people to share and everything taser great. I am a huge fan of eel so I really enjoyed all the eel options that they had. 

I would recommend this place if you are really hungry and looking for an all you can eat place."}
{"text":"I have been to 168 Sushi Buffet several times and most recently a few weeks ago. The restaurant is a standard iPad order setup as many other AYCE Sushi places, however they added a buffet bar for items like the salads, desserts and also where you get your wasabi.  I am not a big fan of the mix of iPad and buffet bar, and would rather have everything ordered by iPad and delivered to the table.  This restaurant has gone downhill a bit over the past couple years and there is also a lot of other options in the AYCE Sushi market right now."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do when I come back to Toronto is hit up the AYCE sushi buffets!  They don't have places like this in Seattle and this is way better than the ones I go to in Vancouver.

The sashimi was all pretty fresh- salmon, white tuna, red snapper, surf clam etc.  I did notice there was no red tuna or hamachi though.  We also had unagi rolls, a fruit roll, rainbow roll and some other yummy rolls.  There was a great selection of about 20 different hand rolls and the cooked food selection was great! They had seaweed salad, edamame, soup noodles, phad thai, fried udon, 3 soups, beef short ribs, about 10 different tempuras and many other things I can't even remember!

For the person who said this isn't a place for foodies: well, its AYCE sushi.  That's never the most quality type for $25 but for the price and format, this is good quality and a great selection! 

I love fancy, nice sushi, but sometimes, a girl's just gotta stuff herself to her stomach's content!"}
{"text":"The Fish is Ok, but the Service Sucks!!!

Very Rude from when you enter the restaurant. The servers are even worse.

I asked the server for some \"Ponzu\" and she didn't even know what it was.

Your a Japanese Restaurant and I know your Korean, but Ponzu is a main ingredient in Japanese food.

The Rolls at \"Stuffed\" with tempura batter and a sliver of fish. More mayo than fish.

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have only had good experiences ordering from the Brampton location. Glad we found this place. The spicy beef is amazing and so are the mixed vegetables. I usually order avocado/cucumber rolls which are very fresh and taste very good. Price is reasonable for the rolls also. The phad thai was okay. Have had better but liked that they include the fried soy and some veggies. It is a little heavy on the noodles however. I'm not a fish eater and will not be ordering the sushi however what we usually get is very good. Had ordered a vegetarian platter once that was nowhere near as good as our usual dishes so I believe there may not be a consistency in terms of quality of each menu item. That should be considered if you decide to order from this restaurant. So far we are impressed though. Much better than Mandarin IMO. I'm a bit stumped by the negative reviews and thinking it must depend on what you order or perhaps who the chef on duty is. We are definitely fans of this restaurant for now though and I am pretty picky when it comes to my food."}
{"text":"If this had been my only Sushi experience ever, I may have been more impressed, but having the inescapable comparison to its namesake leaves much to be desired.

To be fair, the host informed us that this restaurant is NOT part of the Japan 168 chain, but having so much of the experience and the name so similar, it is misleading. The food tasted mostly like it came from the VH Sauce collection, with a couple of exceptions (the bulgogi wasn't bad).

But the sushi? Awful. It tasted old and gross, and I found a long black hair in my roll. No surprise as the main sushi maker was not wearing a hat.

If you are hungry, and want a lot of food, you may enjoy - but if you want \"good\" food, avoid this place.

And Parents - kids eat cheap (free for under 2), but there are no change tables. Major downer."}
{"text":"Food is definitely on par with other AYCE sushi places. However, the service is usually rushed compared to other AYCE places in Mississauga. 

I do love the selection, however 168 is not my go-to AYCE sushi place in Mississauga due to the service."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here and came every weekend with my wife, mom and in law.
Service used to be very good and the food was great, especially for the price. But this was when the restaurant has just opened and for a couple years.
We stopped going there because prices were increased and service and quality has slipped quite abruptly.
We gave it another chance and came back to check if things got any better: we were disappointed again.
Price has gone up again, we were charged some \"weekend\" fare, service was less than cordial (not even a \"hello\" or \"good morning\" before we were led to the table) and the food was average at best.
The chicken and broccoli was bland, the spicy salmon rolls were rich in mayonnaise and the rice was on the uncooked side.
Unfortunately they have literally ran this place down to abandonment.
The first impression is the broken floor tiles right outside the front door, waiting for someone to slip when wet, or to trip on the cracks.
I hope they do something about the facilities and training of staff. 
I won't go back.
Good luck."}
{"text":"For All You Can Eat Sushi this is actually pretty decent service and food quality and a great place to go for groups. I prefer a la carte, but we decided to come here to treat my mom (and her twin!) for their birthdays on Boxing Day. This place fills up quickly in the evening hours but it was quite spacious as we made our reservation for 5:00 PM and left at 6:45 pm. By the time we left the lineup was out the door. 

Their fortes are certainly the sushi rolls and grilled items. The appetizers are quite delicious too, I recommend trying a little bit from each of the different sections (appetizers, grilled items, korean, thai food). The dessert menu isn't on the ipad menu, but the options we had were: Vanilla, Mango, Green Tea and REdbean Icecream, Banana Tempura, Milk Pudding  and Mousse Cake.

I also asked the waiter to give my mom a cake with a candle, which they did at no additional cost (song too!). 

I had a good experience, and would come again :)"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the sushi here, the rice was dry and the seaweed was too flaky. I had the red dragon sushi, green dragon sushi, California roll, spicy salmon roll, cream cheese wontons, shrimp tempura and so much more. The shrimp tempura was soggy as well. It was a disappointing experience for me. I washed it down with the flat coke provided to me at an additional cost."}
{"text":"AYCE and actually tastes good!  $25 dinner on a Tuesday,  well worth it.  The atmosphere is chill but the decor is trendy and fresh.

Reccomendation: the rolls are fresh and regular size, unlike most places that give super tiny portions.

Amazing dumplings and the tom yum soup was very good.  

Best mango ice cream and fried banana."}
{"text":"This is a very good sushi buffet, and they're pretty busy whenever we go. 

The food comes out pretty quick, but the problem is getting your order approved. Even if you put in your order and place your iPad at the corner of the table, they don't come around for quite some time. You could wave the waiter down, but it just feels weird having to do that, so we just wait.

Overall though, the food is good and they let you stay as long as you need."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! 

It's always busy, and food is always good. Great sushi selection, quick service, fresh. 

The only bad thing I have to say is that the Chinese food/ rice and noodle dishes (stuff that isn't your standard sushi place sides like seaweed salad and tempura and miso soup) aren't that good, go to a Chinese place for that stuff. The teriyaki salmon and spare ribs and Shanghai noodles are good though.

Anyways, great staff, fast service, and BEST SUSHI IN TOWN (both cooked and raw!) my family and I go here all the time."}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant, I've only recently (last couple of months) started eating sushi. I'm no sushi expert but I've been to restaurants that have made me want to turn away completely from eating sushi !!   This place is one of the best all you can eat sushi restaurants I've been to. The service was great and we were seated promptly even though the restaurant was packed! They even have the cool little iPad menus which are great for seeing pictures of the foods before ordering, great for new sushi eaters like myself. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"The food here is great - their AYCE menu is extensive and their sushi is delicious! But their terrible service outweighs all the good. The manager has no knowledge of how to respect his customers - he and the waiters have the audacity to ask you for more tip when you're about to leave the restaurant. They are rude and don't understand the concept of good customer service.
It's so unfortunate because I love the food but nothing is worth the attitude we have to deal with when we eat here.

Update: Decided to give it another chance so I went here after almost a year of boycotting it. The menu grew a bit but the quality of the food went way way down. Bad food and bad service :("}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and nice environment! All you can eat was amazing! I travel a lot and try different food and this was simply amazing. Would recommend this place to anyone for sure. Not my first time in Canada and will for sure come back for this food again . Thank you for the amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"What makes this place stand out from other sushi restaurant is the private rooms! 

It deffinately has that Japanese feel to it. As for the food no complaints what so ever! So far everything that I've tried from here I been satisfied with! Especially the crab rolls and the shrimp tempura.

Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because it can be expensive.. for 2 people it cost approx $70 dollars and the alcoholic beverages are also pricey."}
{"text":"This place is gross.  Everything that I got that was stir fried was old tasting.  The oil had gone rancid or something, and everything I ate was dripping in oil. Wont be back."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Mississauga and are trying to find good AYCE sushi places in the area. We went to 168 sushi as per Yelp reviews and were extremely impressed and happy with the value of the money. The variety in the salad bar, and the AYCE menu options is probably the best I have seen so far in my AYCE sushi experience in the GTA (correct me if there is a place with more variety).
The food was fresh and very delicious.

We went on a Saturday so the dinner was for $27.95 which is really reasonable considering the amount of food and variety there is!

I would highly recommend anyone looking for a nice evening of indulging in tasty food and a variety of sushi!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places around! 

For $25 deluxe dinner on the weekend this really is a steal. It's always very busy with excellent service and fresh sushi. This is the only AYCE sushi place I know which serves red tuna (my absolute favorite!!!). You also have your choice of non-alcoholic beverages and dessert included in the price... how can you go wrong?!

I recommend calling before 1pm to make reservations if you decide to dine at peak hours otherwise they may stop accepting them due to capacity."}
{"text":"Much has changed since I've last eaten here; one month shy of a year! Went today for lunch and the quality has deteriorated significantly. Lunch menu = not as vast & less affordable while popular items got moved to the dinner menu that's also increased in price.

Was so used to seeing the restaurant packed full, with lineups out the door at any time of day. Today it was empty. 5 or 6 tables being serviced at most. Maybe it's because I came by shortly after lunch hour, but from experience, there was a noticeable decline in patronage.

Food was also mediocre at best. Some of the salmon ordered weren't fresh. Cuts of fish were super thin (slivers) atop plenty of rice. Rolls were cut huge, filled with more rice than tasty ingredients. Items that should be served hot were actually served cold; soup, tea, some cooked dishes. The distribution of seasoning was also uneven; extremely salty, too spicy or bland. It wasn't good. Short beef ribs = all fat, no meat & over the top salty. Curry = all heat, no flavour. The dish was so spicy, I only managed to eat a quarter of it as my mouth was on fire!

The restaurant is going downhill. After 8+ years, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I ordered delivery, so I didn't visit the restaurant.

Dear God, no - just no. If you're stuck at a local hotel and thinking about using this place for delivery, let me tell you it's a bad idea. 

Ordered: miso soup, Gym Roll, Pink Lady Roll

First, for the positives - my food arrived about 15 minutes earlier than expected and the delivery guy was nice. The miso soup was not horrible. 

Now - be aware that if you order delivery, their online menu is NOT accurate. The Gym Roll is described online as \"crab, shrimp, cucumber & cream cheese\". What arrived was some vile concoction that included very brown \"spicy\" tuna & banana. WTF?? Oh wait, according to the menu that came with my order, the Gym Roll is actually a shrimp roll with bananas and topped with spicy red tuna. First, who the hell puts bananas in sushi? Just hell no to that whole concept. And that \"spicy red\" tuna was old, brown and disgusting.

My second roll was described as \"spicy crab meat topped with smoked salmon\". What I got was a crabstick roll that was full of crunch and more of that brown spicy tuna. There was salmon on top & it was pretty fishy. Both rolls were very large but I just didn't have the heart or stomach to eat more than 2-3 bites of each. 

None of the fish was fresh tasting, nothing I received matched the menu & I can only imagine what I'll be in for later this evening. I've had better & fresher sushi from my local grocer. Avoid!"}
{"text":"It's a sushi/\"asian\" AYCE, a cut above the average. Some of the Cantonese fare is great and the sushi feels above average for the usual AYCE. Felt like the thai-style stuff was better before than now though.

Service seems good and its always super fast. Haven't been in awhile but I'll return."}
{"text":"*** American Review ***
HOLY MOLY!!! I never imagined such a place existed.
It's your typical Japanese restaurant (at least in the states) with a regular menu...but wait....the entire thing is a MADE-TO-ORDER BUFFET!!!

Someone PLEASE bring this idea to the states. There is only one other place I know of in the USA that has AYCE made-to-order sushi...and that's in NYC. Apparently there are a few places that do this there, but I've never seen this in any other city stateside.

Anyway my good friend tells us to meet her there, and we order plate after plate of sushi and other items. This place just blows my mind. Technically speaking this is not a \"buffet\" as a real buffet denotes that food is pre-made and arranged on trays or tables, but a buffet usually connotes the idea of all-you-can-eat....but who cares...it's essentially all you can freaking eat from whatever is on the menu. I LOVE IT!!!!

Before the buffet-phobes and food-snobs say anything the food quality is on par with a normal restaurant. None of those usual tricks like paper-thin slices of fish, or giant sized balls of rice, etc, etc.

I only wish there was one closer. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone, even to my skeptical cousins who believe the food here is questionable.

Only suggestion I have is to make it baby-friendly...diaper changing stations in the bathroom or something =D.

Anyone know what the 168 refers to though? Is that like 168 seats or 168 menu items available or something?

*update* apparently 168 refers to their original location. Thanks Lauren =D"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before, but the one in thornhill, so I already knew what to expect in terms of food, and menu items (and of course, what I could safely eat). One of the most unexpected things that occurred was that we asked for gluten free soy sauce (not expecting it though) and while they didn't have any, it was because they had run out, not because they didn't carry it! While I wish (very much!) that they had had it, I was happy to know it could be there next time. 
In terms of food, I had the usual sushi and handrolls with cucumber and avocado. The handroll with cucumber is actually super dry without anything to dip it in, so I wouldn't recommend it. I also had shrimp dumplings that are wrapped in rice paper.
So so good!! Before our sushi came I enjoyed seaweed salad and mango. I also had edamame, but it was very bland. There are a lot of fish options that are gluten free, but I don't eat raw fish so that limits me. Most of the meat skewers, if not all, come with a soy based sauce, so unfortunately those are a no-go. 
I still ate a ton of food and enjoyed it all! All of the ingredients were very fresh and aside from the edamame, were very flavourful! The food came out very quickly from the time of ordering, always a plus. 
Our server, Sierra, was excellent. She was friendly, polite and did a great job of being there whenever we had a question, needed to order, wanted more water, etc. She also knew what gluten free meant, which is sometimes all I really ask for. Some of the best service I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  If you call ahead of time, you can reserve a private room... up to 8 people.  there are only 6 of these rooms.
The location in Mississauga on Dundas St does not offer these rooms.

Food is good.  Sushi quality is better than normal AYCE expectations.  They also have some kitchen specials; stir fry and dim sums.

I find the servers are much better here.

Lots of parking."}
{"text":"The food is good. They make the food in front of customer. Services are fast. I like sushi. That's why my husband and I would like to come here. Maybe next time I'll invite my friends come."}
{"text":"Almost everyone knows about 168 Sushi, and despite being down the street from me, this was my first visit!
My sushi cravings come up once in a while and that day i was REALLY craving. So i waited for my girl friend to get off work at 9pm to go. Knowing that it was gna be tight on time and that we'd prob only be able to order one round, we still decided to satisfy my cravings lol

We stepped into the restaurant at 9:25pm. So we had a little over an hour. The guy wasnt too happy to take us in. So we quickly went thru the menu and ordered. Our server came to put in our order and was rudely saying how we ordered 40 items and that if we dont finish we will be charged extra which they always warn people. So ok fine. We were a party of four and we were all starving, pretty sure we were able to finish. And whenever i go to all you can eat, i make sure i dont order excessive food cuz i hate wasting food. The food came out pretty quick cuz the kitchen had to close, which was awesome, but it also meant our table ran out of space. And knowing that, they just didnt care and stacked plates on top of plates and even on top of the food. How am I suppose to eat food squash under plates? Didnt even offer to extend our table or switch some items to a smaller plate. They just didnt care. And half way thru, they wanted us to pay the bill too so the cash can close, which was also fine with me knowing they need to close soon, but she was like \"you guys pay now first, ill charge you more later for leftover food\". Excuse me?! Ok wtever, not even gna respond to that. Just paid. After a while, she came to check back, and yelled to her manager at the back in another language not knowing i can understand her \"they're definitely not gna finish\". Excuse me?! RUDE. And then 5 minutes before they close, she came back made no eye contact with us and yelled again to the back \"oh they finished\". 

We finished EVERYTHING obviously. she was just purely rude judging people like that, speaking another language, and pretending to be nice. If i didnt understand her language i wouldve thought she was genuinely nice. But becuz i did, i understood every word she was saying with her attitude. 
The food wasnt bad, not the best, wish i had more time to check out the salad/soup/dessert bar, but with this kind of service, i dont think id be coming back."}
{"text":"Got sick with their AYCE lunch. The food didn't taste that bad, but I can find better. The restaurant is very pretty inside and feels like it's a dinner atmosphere. The service is fast, but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Sashimi slices where very   generous! Fast service ! Lots of seating ! And IPad ordering ! Definitely will be coming again !"}
{"text":"After being to the location in Brampton I had high expectations from the Mississauga location after a 45 minute wait to get a table I was horribly let down, the sashimi portions where below average and didn't taste the greatest . In fact a slice we had was still a bit frozen. The waitress MIA threw the night , but sure hung around when it was time to leave tip! Floors where so greasy I thought I was going to slip and fall while on my way to the bathroom. You have to get your waitresses to come and approve your order to send to the kitchen like I am a child. Only bonus to this place was the salad bar with the crab legs. But this one small thing would not make me come back! The trip to Brampton is way worth it!!!"}
{"text":"When I'm in town, I always go to 168 sushi. I have always got the greatest service here, I love their sushi and meats here. The iPad menu is a good touch and they seem to have more options then other ayce sushi I've been too. They have a salad bar in the back of the restaurant as well. Overall, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order via Just eat - everything is served & delivered to perfection!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner for my wife.
I thought the food was rather good.

We made the mistake of eating way to many spicy tuna rolls before hitting up the Sashimi (Which was also Very good) $20 all you can eat for dinner (pop included) is pretty good."}
{"text":"168 Sushi is a really great quick-fix to satisfy my sushi cravings (that I get pretty much everyday...). Great food and reasonable price. The food service is also timely and efficient, I've never had to wait so long for all my orders to come out & they never missed any of my orders. 

3 stars because the service... The guys are super nice, its just the girl servers that really makes the whole experience negative. They always look miserable (doesn't really bother me, but for the sake of the review I'm mentioning it) and can come off as rude sometimes when I ask them for some spicy mayo, etc. In addition, I noticed that when my table gets full the guy servers will always make room for the new orders themselves while the girl servers will take a look at the table, notice its full and hand me the new orders.. what? LOL I'd be in the middle of putting food in my mouth and suddenly there's another plate of food in my face! It doesn't make me angry but I just find it kind of odd ...Of course I would not mind helping if they just said something instead of just handing the plate of food to me...

Anyway... despite the service, I'd still return because the location is very convenient for me and food is good for its price."}
{"text":"This was superb sushi. I would have given a 5 except the  tempura shrimp were  not de-veined. The thought of eating shrimp poop always revolts me. Other than that the food was excellent and the price reasonable. Unfortunately it us hidden in the back if a strip mall and a bit hard to find."}
{"text":"Yumm, I usually order it to go but I have been to ayce. Consistently good but I don't like their spicy tuna roll its too chunky and not spicy."}
{"text":"Went for the AYCE sushi. It was alright, nothing special. The iPads are a great touch, being able to see the sushi types and ordering was made that much easier. The staff wasn't very pleasant, went in on a Saturday afternoon and they weren't too busy. The food took long to get out and they forgot to bring half of it even after requesting it several times. Not a horrible place, but I definitely won't ho out of my way to go over there."}
{"text":"It's okay. Admittedly one of the better all-you-can-eat sushi places in Mississauga, but that's not saying much really lol. Lots of options and the staff is helpful (sometimes). Can get kinda pricey though."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Sunday around 5:30 for supper and were seated right away. We ordered on the iPads and our food started showing up almost immediately. I wish I had been able to eat more because the sashimi was delicious. I was also impressed that the rolls didn't have a ton of rice for filler. Our service was prompt, the water glasses were always filled and our plates were cleared almost as soon as we finished the food on them. 

Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here if you don't wanna be sick!! This is my first review on Yelp but I think that everyone should know.. My friend & I used to go here at least once a week & starting a few months ago, the sushi got really bad and we got food poisoning from it Everytime. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Being cheaper than other sushi buffets in GTA - I was expecting lower quality food, but it turns out that the food is really good and overall better than most Ive been too. 

Their beef is really tender and flavourful. Deep fried items really crispy and not overly greasy/soggy. They even have fresh Shu mai which was a surprise as I was expecting the cheap frozen ones, but it was just as good as a quality dim sum restaurant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Sushi and Service, plus the iPad ordering system makes it easy to see what you're ordering. 

Friendly Hostess named Sierra already sets the friendly atmosphere as soon as you walk in, and all the servers are so sweet!  One of them actually overheard me mention that my work BB/Pager was almost dead and took it to charge for me while we ate...where else can you get that type of service!

Everything is delicious here.  Sushi is fresh, the steak is tender and flavorful. 

Always worth the drive from the east end of the City!"}
{"text":"Ok. I'm not one to write reviews but I just have to do this. To provide context. I'm accustom to Spoon & Fork in Oakville but my wife and I have been going there for a couple years and we wanted to try something different. WELL 168 is definitely \"different\" but not a good different. The price point is the same as Spoon & Fork so we thought this is comparable but that's where is falls off the rails. 

Decor - think old Manadrin with low lighting. The decor is quite poor and not for a special occasion or any occasion for that matter. 

Wait staff - inattentive, slow and had to asked for everything. We had servers literally \"throw\" the dishes on our table and proceed to the next table. 

Food - think food court quality and on bottom of that scale. Our favourite dishes were just awful. The satay beef should be called \"candied beef\".  Poor representation of Chinese and Thai but the worst was the sushi. They added so much fillers and included very little fish. This place is not for people who love sushi. 

iPad ordering - such a gimmick. You have to work for your food. The menu and waiter system is way more efficient. 

This is a good place for a bunch of guys to hang out with and don't care about where their eating. Low class, crappy service and sub par food. Not for a date, with friends or the special evening with the Wife.  People definitely did not dress up but for $27 go to Oakville and see the difference. 

I didn't know how good Spoon & Fork was. Now I do. BTW I don't work for Spoon & Fork but I do take date night VERY serious (my wife has me well trained ;)

Not recommended."}
{"text":"--- Food ---
I came here with a friend for their lunch AYCE buffet, which is priced at $15.95. It's a great price but don't expect fancy dishes. E.g. their salmon rose is simply 2 salmon sashimi pieces wrapped around rice. But it was decent! The sushi were fresh. My favourite was their grilled mackerel and salmon belly! 

--- Atmosphere ---
I've been to the 168 Sushi restaurant in London, Ontario before. It seemed to have the same interior design feel inside. It is nice and modern, great place for hanging out with friends. The service was fast and friendly. 

--- Summary --- 
For the price of only $15.95 for AYCE sushi, would come back again for the variety of food to try. Using the iPad as menu gives bonus points to the User Experience as well!  The atmosphere is also great for hanging out with pleasant customer service."}
{"text":"Our only choice whenever we crave for sushi. Very friendly staff, excellent food, great menu choices and ample seatings. I like the concept of using the iPad menu. Very convenient. On top of that lunch is very affordable."}
{"text":"The sushi here is decent, and the ipad menus are a neat concept. However, the sushi rolls (maki) contain far too much rice, and you end up getting full very quickly, on not much seafood. I would recommend coming here for sashimi, but if you're looking for better value (and less rice) then I would head up to KB Sushi instead (they also have ipad menus!)"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot in Mississauga - always busy so food is fresh! The menu is so vast that there is something for everyone to eat.

iPad menu makes it easy to order & to read about the dish.

Friendly staff.

Only downside it's a bit pricier than most."}
{"text":"Was it a sushi place? No. They only had 5 real sushis and the rest were avocado contained white people sushi. 
I appreciated the seaweed salad and Miso soup but the rest can go."}
{"text":"After working out at Lifetime Athletic, I somehow felt famish. And I was told to load up on protein. The easier way out, is all-u-can-eat place. I looked into insauga.com for the Top 5 restos in that genre and came across this restaurant that was nearby. 

Being hungry by 1 pm didn't help as we waited around 25 minutes for a table. I was surprised that it was packed, but then again, I should have realized from the parking lot spaces available. They were apologetic that we had to wait and I hoped my hunger will stay with me to eat up!!! 

Happy:  This place has an ipad menu system but I don't like how you have to get the waiter before you can send in the order. Most items came to you as you sat and ate like a king. There was a small section which you can get up and get yourself these choices: soup, salad, dessert and the best part for me - ice crush shaver which you can drizzle with whatever toppings were provided. They even have a light sweet mango salad for you to grab. 

The dishes came out rapidly and HOT which I like. Some dishes did take awhile that I forgot I ordered them, like the grilled mackerel and grilled eggplant. The short ribs and other beef dishes were cooked right. The rolls came nicely wrapped up and tasted fresh. 

Not happy:  They didn't have the typical Japanese salad that I like with their house dressing. There could have been more vegetarian choices. Obviously, the wait time wasn't the greatest since I was a very hungry cat. Next time we know, make rsvp on the weekends. 

Verdict:  I would definitely go back if I am in the neighbourhood. It's about $2-3 dollars difference(higher) from other a-u-c-e Jap restaurants in Mississauga. If you don't want to wait, make sure you rsvp. Even when were were leaving, there was still people coming in to eat - late for  a Sunday."}
{"text":"This is probably the best AYCE Sushi place in Mississauga. The sashimi is fresh, cut in nice sizes and the sushi is great too since they don't pile on the rice. The specialty rolls were good too except for the black snow roll.. didn't really like the rice paper. And the spicy salmon was a bit too spicy for me but different strokes for different folks! The mississauga roll was especially good..love their cream cheese. I also liked it in the cheese wonton. The mushroom and beef roll was great. The house salad was lacklustre though. Oh well.

The best thing about this place is the service. No, they're not smiley or super-polite but it's decent enough and not very important for AYCE. What was great was that they didn't miss any orders.. a common occurrence in AYCE, and the food came out FAST... so much that we had plates covering the entirety of our table.

PS: It's easy to miss this place. Their storefront basically just says JAPAN BUFFET and looks pretty sketchy. Don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Definitely the best AYCE sushi place I've been to. Usually you trade off quality if you want all you can eat, but this place is quite good. No, it's not sushi that will change your world, but it's really good and all you can eat.

Incredible selection of both sushi, and other Chinese / Korean / Japanese dishes, all of which are all you can eat.
iPad menus make it easy to see descriptions of each item and stock photos to get an idea of what you order. Sashimi is only available at the dinner menu (costs more but has a wider selection of options)"}
{"text":"I have come here with friends  . 168 Sushi has made many improvements over the years with the addition of the tablet to order items .  I recommend going on a weekday when  you can avoid the rushes. Order  whatever you feel like and focus on the experiences instead of stuffing yourself. 
My recommendation is to go with like minded friends and make a plan to order  the items  that will give the group  the opportunity to eat the best food on the menu without  going with the flow and running into items  that may not be so great. 
The servers are very attentive to your needs and will make sure you have a good experience . 
It is worth the cost provided you go with my recommendation. 
 The next trip  will depend on when the next sushi craving arises ."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed my experience here! I rarely get AYCE sushi just because it's not really the main thing I'd choose to go to, but this place is really nice and the food was good as well! The food did take a little longer than an average sushi place to come out, but I didn't mind at all as I was in a group of people so we were chatting away and hardly noticed it. The food was good as well, and the people working were really nice. I haven't been back since, but I am looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant NEEDS a major face lift. 
One of the major down sides to this place is that they don't have a Philadelphia roll. At least that's what I've noticed the couple of times I've been there recently.
Another thing I've noticed is that their crab meat isn't the best. It has a weird taste to it, like it's been defrosted. 
Other than that, it's a typical all you can eat sushi place."}
{"text":"I got here based on a review from a friend and I LOOOOVED it:) something about the taste of the food is new (and I don't just mean the coriander that the potager seems to be a big fan of since he adds it to every soup:)
I liked everything, the service was also great (lucky me:)) I will definitely go back, just note to self to make a reservation since this place gets crazy busy."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not visible from the street, Kennedy but we'll worth the drive around the back of the strip mall. Started with a Tom yum soup, well prepared and then into an endless selection of suchi on the I pad. The time from order to delivery was amazing! 
I will definitely be stopping in again when I'm in the neighborhood ."}
{"text":"The quality of the fish is always top notch here! The service is prompt (at times the waitstaff is a bit awkward but no harm done) and the menu has a great selection and wide variety. 

The tempura is well done, takoyaki is a must try! My friend loves the dumpling soup; and with good reason, the portion isn't too big so don't worry about not having room XD

 Those who don't actually eat seafood will not be leaving hungry either, some of my top picks in the non seafood selection include their beef stick, cheese wonton, and fried tofu. They do have a whole section of fried rice and noodles, but I'm sorry to say I didn't dabble in it too much. 

Last but not least the atmosphere of the pace is very comfortable. It can get a little loud in the afternoons as most of the clientele is young adults, but the decorations are very chic and inviting, with great music. This is a great place to be with friends."}
{"text":"I would have to say that, this ONE time dining experience was catastrophic.... I have come various times before to this location and always came out loving it.... This time I left quite disappointed... The service was lacking, the orders were not fully served and no one remedy to care about service... Everyone was focused on putting up decorations.... If you're going to focus on decorations then don't open the doors to serve food....

There was at least 3 services missing and did not care to ask for them since it's an all you can eat I just re ordered them..

Poor service, no attention to customers....

The chefs on the other hand, as perfectionists as always, their food quality still remains great and great presentation....

I will only come back because of taste and presentation, not because of the service"}
{"text":"I like Heart Sushi better because of the chocolate ice cream, but this place is much closer. I'd say that it's worth the price, tastes great. Service can be a little slow when they're busy but that's understandable."}

{"text":"You would be hard pressed to find a worse way to waste your $25 on AYCE sushi dinner. I understand that generally you're sacrificing quality for quantity at an AYCE, but 168 is below average in AYCE sushi quality.

As many commenters have already mentioned, the fish is often nonexistent in the maki rolls. The age of the avocado was evident by its mud brown colour and mucky texture. The beef teriyaki is comically bad in quality- it literally looks like they've been skinning rats out back.

As bad as the quality of the food is- the service is even worse. Expect to stand there and wait around while the host chills hangs out for a couple minutes. On top of that, ask 4 different servers for the bill and get it a half hour later. 168 seems like it's fooling people in to thinking it's a good place because you order on an iPad...but that doesn't translate in to a good meal."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I've been lucky so far with their exceptional service and it honestly can't go wrong for the price. I love the new ipad system which not only saves on paper but gives us a visual on what to order especially for us sushi noobs. I prefer going for their lunchtime all you can eat cause the dinner one is expensive to me since I really can't eat that much but regardless I would choose this over the regular sushi restaurants in the area. I have already made the mistake of trying restaurants in the area and I won't be making that mistake again. Can't wait to be back 168 sushi."}
{"text":"Great variety of food. All you can eat crab legs during dinner at the cold bar! Friendly staff , food was fresh."}
{"text":"Omg food is so gross. So flavourless too!!! Dusty place, ok atmosphere, kinda cheap feel though. Love the iPad ordering concept!  Nice waiter gets another star for the place. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"168 is not terrific and much of the menu comes across as pre-made. A similar joint just a major street over on Hurontario/Main is far superior."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite all you can eat Japanese restaurant. Service was great, not like most places that seem rushed and just whip your food down. We didn't feel rushed and it was busy. All the food tasted good and they had a few items that a lot of other places don't have for lunch like whole grilled mackeral. They did not have red tuna which is normally pretty standard. There is a side salad/soup/dessert bar which I also like, instead of sitting waiting the whole time. They also do not offer seniors discount but it did not matter as we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"good. Sushi. a little complex to order but you will figure out eventually. They need to improve the desert bar."}
{"text":"I've been to 168 Sushi Japan Buffet in Brampton and Mississauga. Both restaurants are usually pretty packed. 
My overall experience is it's not worth the price, you're better off heading to Heart Sushi in Hearthland or even Daikon on Winston Churchill, close by. 
The kalbi was great but inconsistent. The fish is hardly there in the rolls. I don't understand why a place would charge you $30 and then not give you what you've paid for. The food was OK, nothing stood out. It was a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends went here for dinner last night and it has definitely changed since the last time I've been there. They were under renovations before so now it looks completely different. The interior is dark and more modern compared to their previous look. The coolest thing is that we get to order off of an iPad instead of using paper and a pencil. 

Our orders came out pretty quick and I don't think any of our orders went missing. The sashimi was nicely sliced and fresh...yum salmon sashimi! The rolls didn't fall apart and had the perfect amount of rice, not too little and not too much. The unagi sushi's were really good!

Me and my friends would definitely go again!

PS: Drinks aren't included in the ayce price anymore. But hey, why have sugary drinks when you can just drink tea or water."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of choices! But there are always a lot of people here on the weekends. It takes a while for any service to come and they sometimes forget. Some of the kitchen foods don't seem too fresh. But the sushi and sashimi are really good and large in portion. One of the better sushi buffets in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday night. Very packed. Believe it or not they already had valentines day decorations up already.

With the amount of tables they had. It was very packed after 7. Took us no longer than 25 mins of wait for a table of two. 

Firstly they had ipads for ordering menus: great upgrade. No less than 5 mins our order started piling in and fast! Which to my suspicion: the food may have been prepared well in advanced. Only a handful of sushi rolls were fresh in that regard. The service was quick and very attentive to our tables as they cleaned up our dishes as we finished them.

Dessert was very common. They offered fried banana,  fried rice pudding and ice cream flavors of green tea, mango and red bean. 

When the server came to clean up our table before dessert., she asked me to finish some of the left over rolls. I really wished she didn't do that. Although she did offer the discounted take out price. I opted to finish it."}
{"text":"Hot dishes are way better then the sushi, quality of fish is not great, but the price for lunch is good, at under $15, I didn't feel ripped off. Not bad, but not great, just mediocre. Would give it 2.5 stars, but no half star."}
