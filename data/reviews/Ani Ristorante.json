{"text":"Friendly atmosphere. The meat was perfect : shish kebab, lula kebab. Armenian dolma was gorgeous. All salads were fresh and delicious. The owner Suren very nice person same as Ashot the waiter. Price is more then affordable.  We visited this restaurant at April 1st 2014. We were 10 people celebrated birthday. Everybody likes this place. I Strongly recommend Ani restaurant for the family party or just for diner or launch."}

{"text":"So I was excited to try to *authentic* Armenian food.  If only I really got it. I ordered a bunch of appetizers (thinking I'd take the leftover back), and my two friends just had entrees. We also ordered a bottle of wine.  30m later, nothing to show. We had to remind her about the wine... and she finally brought us glasses. By now an appetizer had arrived, but still no wine. We had to repeatedly remind them, so that finally about an hour in JUST the wine and a few appetizers had arrived. My friend decided he didn't want to drink anymore, so we got a glass. I'll admit - the glass was huge.  But - the service just continued to deteriorate. The waitress frequently complained about the other tables, and even though I spoke no Russian, continued to only speak in Russian (and her English was great). Finally my friends' entrees came. We asked about ours - oh it's coming. We asked. We asked. We asked again.  2 hours in, no food. Excuses left and right. We said nevermind - the appetizers I had was enough.  When it came to pay the bill, even though our friend had left (and paid), they tried to charge us for his entree. When we said hey you should remove it, they did... but just the base price, not the tax! When I pointed that out, I was just told \"Fine, tell us what your totals are.\"  The food was OK. But the service was so atrocious that I would never ever recommend this place to anyone."}

{"text":"Great takeout. My family always gets the kebab + salad. Friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"Celebrating close friend's birthday and anniversary. The Mediterranean style food is excellent, especially shish kebabs and hinkali (Georgian style dumplings). Service is attentive and timely.  Highly recommend for a casual dinner and wine with friends."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a lower star rating, I would. I have no idea what the food tastes like, as I'm still angry and debating whether to throw it out. I decided to try Ani Ristorante out and got a lula kebab meal ($13.50 on 2 different menus) for takeout. When the waitress came with the bill I told her its fine and I'll just pay cash, and handed her a 20. She gave me 2$ back, and when I asked her how it ended up being so much, she just flashed me the receipt which said $13.50 and bottom line $18 and utters 'taxes'. I was so flabergasted that I just walked out instead of arguing, and I'm still angry at myself for not taking my money back and leaving. I feel bad for the owners of this place, but there is no way I will ever come back to a place where the staff flagrantly tries to rip you off.  Edit- after caving to my hunger and eating the food, I must admit that it was at least delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great authentic food and receptors so good. Chebureki tasted great and the Russian salad."}
