{"text":"We had our anniversary celeb here!! We had a lovely dinner!! Great food and good costumer service!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Cattle Baron before, but it's been at least 3 years since our last visit. I am not a beef eater, so I had the Ahi Tuna. I have to say it was the best I've ever had. Absolutely delicious! The other 3 diners I went with had steak. All of them said Cattle Baron has the best tasting steak ever. My husband usually uses HP sauce...he didn't even open the bottle. No need for it.   Service was great. Having been there before and knowing how busy it gets we were there at 4pm when it opened and the parking lot was filling up fast. Before we got our main course the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times pre-Yelp and it has always been good,  but my latest visit was just ok.  The service was good with only a minor miscommunication regarding a side for one of the four meals ordered.   My peppercorn steak was cooked to order and was a decent portion. Two in our group of four ordered the cut filet. These meals were appetizing enough, but small portions and as a special for $39 definitely disappointing. The fourth meal was a regular filet mignon which looked great and satisfied that particular diner.  We shared a nice Malbec which complimented the red meat fiesta.  I recommend the Cattle Baron, but I think there are very comparable steak houses around Calgary. One of my close friends felt the Keg is easily equal and I tend to agree."}

{"text":"Extremely busy Saturday night and yet we received the most friendly and efficient service from Gemma. We have been here many times and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and have decided to post a review.  Even when busy, the hostess always manages to seat us quickly without a reservation.  The atmosphere is nice and fairly family oriented.  The menu offers a good selection, however there are not enough appetizer selections without seafood in them.  For a steak house, I was disappointed in my fillet mignon being undercooked in the middle. I like rare meet but it was even too rare for me to eat. At the same visit, my husbands strip was overbooked.  There must have been someone new on the grill because previous visits the meat was done to perfection.  The chocolate cake is amazing for dessert  and big enough to share! Great selection of wine and liquor available."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at cattle baron. We ordered two 20oz rib steaks, one 10oz prime rib, french onion soup, calamari, lobster mac and cheese, and a bottle of wine. We arrived without a reservation on a Tuesday night and they didn't have a booster for my 3 year old because they were all in use. The host was pleasant, and we were seated promptly. The waiter was nice as well. My wife liked the french onion soup. The calamari wasn't very good, it tasted like it had freezer burn and was far from fresh. The lobster mac and cheese had a faint taste of lobster with a small amount of little chopped bits that might have been lobster. The steaks were cooked medium rare, but were both really chewy for some odd reason, same went for the prime rib. I asked for fries with my rib steak even though it wasn't on the menu and they accommodated my request which was really nice. The fries tasted great! Overall the service was great, but the food really wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"If your looking for AAA Alberta Beef...this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in to grab a bite one evening...  one of those \"I haven't tried this place before, but it's RIGHT HERE\" zero effort decisions.    With that in mind, we headed straight for the lounge to grab a table, pint, and dinner, in that order.  Knowing nothing about this place, and therefore having zero preconceived ideas from reviews, or word of mouth;  the choice was simple: \"It's a steakhouse. Steak should be safe.\"    Now, as an aside, I have to say I don't often order steak in a restaurant anymore, because it usually leads to bitter disappointment.   Typically in the form of microscopic or too thin cuts with a laughable price tag.     However, I did a bit of a double take, so to speak, when I bit into my striploin.   It had the same flavor I get off of my charcoal grill at home, when using pure lump hardwood as the fuel.     That flavor is completely different from a gas grill, for one.  It's pretty unique.  And I really can't recall the last time a restaurant served me a steak that had \"that\" going on.  The portion size was enough that you didn't need to fill up on appetizers beforehand.  Which is a rarity to be sure.    Otherwise, the place in general seemed more casual than your typical \"steakhouse\" (which are often pretentious), which is fine.  I can't speak to the dining room, but I'd certainly return to try IT out, and sample more of the menu.      Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 7/30"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good! Dry ribs and a twice stuffed potato is a definite must! The stake sandwich is a ribeye steak, great food for the amount you pay! The restaurant is always busy, but wait time isn't ever too long. Great overall night out!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. . . , came to CattleBaron for an Xmas party and the reviews had me excited to eat. While the service was good, the food was disappointing. I ordered chicken breast stuffed with spinach and feta, which came with a side of rice and roasted veg.  The rice looked and tasted like Uncle Ben's, the vegetables were mushy and the chicken looked like it came in a plastic wrapper.. . , which was taken out of a box. . . . that was purchased at Costco.  I feel bad that my boss had to pay for a meal like that for 26 of us. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Cattlebaron.  From the dry ribs, to the Tuna steak, it always delivers.    It was NYE, so it was quite busy, but it had settled down quite a bit by the time we got there.  Still, we waited an hour for our meal.  Our service was good - not great - but again, it was NYE, so i understand that she was busy and tired.    This time I had a NY, with pepercorn sauce and mushrooms on the side.  The steak was delicious, well cooked, and flavourful.     The veg with the meal was brocolini, and carrots.  The carrots were flavourless and generally unedible, and the brocolini was good, but a tad overcooked.    Overall a good meal that I enjoyed - but have had allot better experiences for the pricetag."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best steak I've ever had in a restaurant- yes even better than the keg! And their mashed potatoes are to die for! This is our go to restaurant for date night. Not so much for the ambiance as it's not really our scene in that perspective, but the food is what brings us back time and time again."}
{"text":"Though this place is a steak house, you can get some really delicious non steak entrees. The service is great and for me, it's nice and close to home. Of course, the steaks are amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly the best peppercorn steak I have ever had. I hardly ever get steak when I go to a restaurant because I can normally make a better one at home. Since I was at a steakhouse I thought I would give it a try. Honestly worth every cent. My wife had the stuffed chicken with feta and spinach and it was incredible as well!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why this place gets good reviews.   The service was flawless, and our server is why there's any stars in the first place.   We were there for Friday dinner. We ordered the steak Neptune and the sliced filet with a pinot noir sauce with mushrooms. We both got the garlic mashed potatoes.   The food is so incredibly bland. The potatoes came out in the shape of the mold they were stored in, sprinkled with paprika and green onion. No garlic was detected, nothing but straight up plain potato. The steaks were wholly under-seasoned and grossly overcooked. The broccolini and carrots were greasy, the asparagus limp, the crab tinny, the hollandaise lumpy. It was just dreadful. Cafeteria food at best. Never again."}
{"text":"I have been there so many times. The service and quality is always the same; great. Recently we went with our toddler. It was the best service. My sons meal was out within 5 min, and ours followed quickly. Even though it was busy, it wasn't noisy. Which is awesome with a young child. And for a great steakhouse it is priced affordable."}
{"text":"Update:  Came back for a second chance. Ordered the same as last time (steak). This time the service was fantastic they didn't have 1 person running all of lounge + behind the bar....they seemed to be fully staffed this time. Food wait time wasn't bad at all.  3stars now 5stars"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service.  If you love steak, lamb, salmon and appetizers this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Calgary. Very good food, very well managed. I feel welcomed there and there don't skimp. Really appreciate this restaurant because restaurants like this are few and far between."}
{"text":"Not feeling like cooking and wanting to eat somewhere we never tried before in our neighbourhood we settled here.  We sat in the lounge near the fireplace and had probably one of the best servers of all time. She was attentive, smart and knew what people wanted - she really made our experience.  To order we had the beef carpaccio, seafood platter and tomato, onion and feta salad. Everything was fantastic from the wine list to the timing of the food to the taste of the food.   I would go back again and hope we get the same experience as the first time!"}
{"text":"This is my brothers favourite steak place in the city. We always end up here for his birthday. The steaks are great, the service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is lovely. The salads leave something to be desired but this is not unexpected at a steak house."}
{"text":"Excellent steak, excellent salad, and great service.  Their filet mignon was spot on.  At least one drinkable beer on tap, more than you can say for most local restaurants.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"5 star service ,5 star atmosphere,5 star food. One of the best steak houses period.First time at the south location. Enjoyed it very much. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite steak restaurant in Calgary!  Please do not look at the negative review made by someone eating chicken!  This place is for steak!  I get it some people don't eat red meat but don't come here!  I love the steak and have been here many many times and plan to return many more!  I love the roast beef too!  Yes it's fairly expensive but you get what you pay for.  The atmosphere is great even on the bar side.  Drinks are good and the staff is always pleasant and not wearing slutty outfits.  I appreciate eating at a place that makes me feel like a million dollars and this place does that for me. A job well done or maybe I should say medium rare lol"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! It's my go to for a good prime rib dinner. The wait staff is always top notch just like the food."}
{"text":"Needing to have some Alberta beef in Calgary and this is the place I chose.  Coming here at like 2p on a Saturday it was empty. Literally only one car and one table occupied.  The rib eye was delicious. And this twice baked potatoes, delicious. Topped with chives and bacon made it awesome.  The steak salad though while large with three skewers of steak was plenty but the steak sauce on the steak, what is it hiding? Still tasted good but I just like the pure taste of the ribeye.  The waitress was very nice and cause we were one of two/three tables, came often enough for what we needed but certainly wasn't pushy.  It was in this odd business plaza where nothing else was open. Hope it has more people at other times."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, staff are wonderfully pleasant and informative. Only complaint is the ambiance. TURN THE MUSIC DOWN! Between the horrid selection and volume of the music on top of chatter from customers, it was virtually impossible to carry on a conversation with our table mates. I expect an atmosphere like this at a chain whose name I won't mention, but it starts with an E and ends with an 's. ;)  On the plus side, we asked our server if the music could be turned down, and it was, which earned some points. However, it shouldn't have been necessary to ask, and by the end of the meal, the volume was back up."}
{"text":"This was such a treat! My second night in Alberta and my first Alberta steak. I couldn't have asked for better food, company or service!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service and not as expensive as some other steak places.  My favorite restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant two times and both times it got A's from me and my family for its Grade A steak.  This Midnapore option is kind off the beaten path but well worth it.   My mother and I discovered Cattle Baron one day while strolling along with her wheelchair.    She ordered the dry ribs and I the prime rib medium rare... well needless to say the dry ribs were abandoned and I noticed my steak shrinking, the meat was done with such perfection, so tender and so succulent, and in minutes flat it was gone.     I returned with a bigger party and this time my mother and I both ordered the prime rib.  Did I mention ordering the prime rib? Each order comes with a choice of salad, fries baked potato or whipped potato with garlic butter, and we both choose the latter every time.  This restaurant not only exceeds you expectations steak wise but it gets huge points on its service and the attention given to you as a client.  The tables are always impeccable, the staff so friendly and genuine, and we have always had such great dining experiences here.  Now to get to the prices, my mother was so impressed by our $30 bill that she left the waiter a $10 tip because that is what she had expected to pay.  A much better option in my opinion than Ruth Chris' Steakhouse for well over half the price."}
{"text":"A good steak house. I wanted a good Alberta beef steak before leaving Canada - and I got it here."}
{"text":"I order the scallop appetizer which was the superb! So amazing, melt in your mouth yummy goodness!!! I also has the salmon salad which was good and I enjoyed it- have had better though. I give this restaurant a five star rating, there service was wonderful, food tasty, place was clean, loved the patio option; enjoying my dinner in the sun. Oh and good drinks too!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I had heard such good things about this restaurant but it was a total let down. Although the service was prompt and excellent, the meal itself was nothing to write home about. I had better steaks in dive bar steak sandwiches and my husband's prime rib was all gristle and way over done.  This sub par meal came with an overpriced price tag. We will not return"}
{"text":"Average nothing stellar.. Similar to an overpriced Ricky's especially since their garlic mashed potatoes come out of a box! The manager said 'oh no they are made fresh' funny thing our server went and asked the chef and found out otherwise.. Not too classy Manager!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Cattle Baron with significant other. Eric was our server and he was very professional and friendly. He checks us often to see if everything was good. The food was great, we ordered rib eye with ceasar salad and salt n pepper prawns for appetizer. The rib eye just melts in your mouth and was cooked and plated perfectly. The ambiance and lighting was good giving the atmosphere a touch of class and upscale cozziness.  Ryan the manager was kind enough to visit our table to see that we had a splendid time. The mud pie is a must to try. Definitely recommend for a great dining experience. Good for couples, family and groups."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The waitress and the menu were right out of the 80s and she didn't care more than the teenagers who plagued steak house floors back then. The food - it was perfect. The chef clearly knew his steak and potatoes but unfortunately for him people who want great steak with a decent attitude and perhaps something a little more daring then double baked with an escargot appetizer will have to find it elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steak houses in Alberta! Sadly I can't remember our servers name but let me tell you...he's top notch! AmaZing food and even better service makes this place a five star for me and my family!"}
{"text":"After visiting the the Spruce Meadows Christmas Market my wife and I decided to give these guys a shot. They've been around for so long but neither of us had ever tried them out.  Despite being a busy Friday night, we were able to get a table with almost no wait. Our server was good, a little on the chatty side, but always right there when needed.  The food was good. I had the prime rib, my steakhouse go-to. The server warned that the horse radish could peel paint, which was a great warning, but also I love a good strong horse radish on my steak/rib. The letdown for me here was being talked into an expensive mediocre bottle of wine. The server gave a sob story about the California wildfires wiping out many vinyards so the restaurant wanted to help out by promoting wines from the area, but also save patrons money before prices go up due to the lack of product coming from the area in the coming years. The story was good, it obviously worked because I got a bottle, but the wine was shit...errr...severely disappointing.  The whole evening was good though despite the wine."}
{"text":"Slow service to get cocktails and not even very busy. Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to the Cattlebaron was outstanding. Went there with a large group of 12 people, and not only did our steaks come quickly but each order was correct.  Our server was super friendly and was knowledgable with respect to wine pairings and dessert options. The restaurant is quiet and the atmosphere is more modern than your average steakhouse. I highly recommend this place for large groups whether for family get-togethers or teambuilding business outings.  After dinner we were free to visit and enjoy dessert for almost an hour and a half after we had finished her dinner nice relaxing evening."}
{"text":"This place is classy, pricey, solid, with good sense of style.  Definitely a steakhouse, I won't imagine ordering seafood there - though would guess it shall be quite reasonable.  Our steaks were, though, professional grade. Not necessarily \"oh my gawd the best ever!\" type of thing, but something worth its money. Quality thing.  Portion size was not particularly impressive, and I think there was no reason to save on that. That relates to wine department as well. Hence only four stars.  Service was... you know, again - professional. Upscale type, but not arrogant - jus there, balancing on the margin.  This is a place where I can comfortably bring friends from the \"wealthy group\" and just enjoy a nice lunch or dinner, family style."}
