{"text":"Great coffee! Great owners! And they even had a treat for the dog!  I was standing outside with the dog while my girlfriend went in and ordered us something and they said I could bring the dog in. They then served a treat that Pitt dog couldn't get enough. We then had an amazing coffee! I highly recommend and we'll be frequent visitors."}
{"text":"My prayers have been answered!! Living very close to Detroit I've spent years dealing with the coffee ghost town that it was! Now I feel like I've won the jackpot with 3 great coffee shops within minutes.  Addicted is my go to shop. Open super early, with a great staff that is very friendly.  The place is clean and oh so cute inside.  My drink of choice is the Red Eye.  My kiddos love the ice cream too. Good quality at a fair price. So glad to have this business in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Great coffee, hot chocolate, cider, muffins, etc. the owner is very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"They serve up an awesome cup of joe. I've only had the house blend but it was awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I look forward to walking here with my daughter in the summer for ice cream."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee! The nitro brew is one of my favorites. The employees (possibly owners) are fast and kind. They have great deals, I just got a medium coffee of my choice and muffin/pastry for $5. Shop local!"}
{"text":"One of the best iced chai teas I have ever had! Not the best service and seemed a bit disorganized (they didn't have the nitro brew my fianc√© wanted). Nearby parking can be difficult to find on a weekend morning. The \"Brookie Bomb\" (cookie dough surrounded by brownie) was delicious - especially after putting it in the fridge. We plan to return for the ice cream."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new coffee shop in Lakewood. Like the name says, it serves coffee and ice cream all year round. It's normal priced coffee and it tastes pretty good. I got their white chocolate mocha and it was pretty good. I liked it because it wasn't piping hot enough to burn your tongue. Their ice cream flavors are pretty standard. You can also get cones with chocolate on them which I think is cool. There aren't too many places to sit so I think it's more of a to-go place. Other than that I like it a lot. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Lakewood!  Vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso on top and whipped cream:  perfect afternoon treat.  Great prices as well.  Be back soon"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place the other day and my only complaint is that I don't live closer! The ice cream selection is great. They have Superman ice cream, which I have trouble finding anywhere! Ok prices. 2 dollars for one scoop. Seems like they might just do bowls. She didn't ask if I wanted a cone. They also have a large coffee and tea selection."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Owner was super friendly and enjoys communicating with everyone, I got a great vibe at this place! He offered me a sample of the mocha latte and it was everything I hoped for and more! Would love to work here but I will settle for being a frequent customer for now!"}
{"text":"$2.95 for two scoops of delicious ice cream! I tried this place while waiting for Angelos. Took it for later and it was such a great dessert!! Very friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee and bakery selection.  I'm impressed how fast they've gotten everything up and running.  The whole operation was running smoothly with a steady stream of customers and the owners were still took time to chat.  They've got some impressive hours too! 5:30 - 8 weekdays. 5:30 - 9 Fridays.  6:30 - 9 Saturdays.  And they're even open on Sunday 7:30 - 4. They must be sampling their own caffeinated beverages!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and everything I've had has been amazing!!

The iced mocha was my first go-to favorite. It's not terribly sweet and gives me just the kick I need to get my day going! 

But OH MAN. Then I discovered the Nitro cold brew and my life was changed. It's creamy, dark, and full of caffeine. And you get to pour it from the tap yourself, how fun is that?

If you love coffee, especially cold brew coffee, definitely check it out!!  The desserts look amazing too and I can't wait to try them."}
{"text":"I got a caramel iced latte with almond milk and a blueberry muffin. Both were very good! I have no complaints whatsoever! I can't wait to go back! Also, how neat is that penny countertop?!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time and grabbed a coffee and white hot chocolate.
GREAT service. Nice people. 
When you are longing for a friendly, local coffee house, stop in. 
I will be back to try to ice cream!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other Day and I loved the Vibe from start to finish. Seemed to be ahead the time here in Ohio; but exactly what I expect back in SoCal. I was impressed with the nitro coffee which I added two pumps of sugar free vanilla and Ice. The in house Baker had made some Blueberry muffins with some cobbler fusion type concoction that reminded me of a little bakery in Cambria that sold muffin tops only.  I will be back"}
{"text":"I stopped in today and finally tried this place! I got there coconut caramel latte that was on special and added a scoop of butter pecan ice cream to it. It was probably more sugar than I've had in months but well worth it! So delicious and I'm talking at about a hundred miles per hour right now. Haha I was pleased to find that they have breakfast burrito makings, snacks including healthy salads, ice cream, coffee bar and shaved ice. Totally going back as I passed this place on the way to work every morning."}
