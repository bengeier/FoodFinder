{"text":"I had the pleasure of enjoying one of Loca Popa's wraps yesterday. I cannot say enough on how I am impressed and filled I was after eating the \"Farm Boy\" wrap. The falafel, which is homemade, is spot on. The toppings and sauce(which is homemade, also), is awesome! I cannot wait to get back and try another one of their delicious wraps. Thanks Lexy and Megan for making me full and satisfied!
If you are looking for something fresh and great at lunch, don't bother with the other Trucks!

Best of Luck and keep that Falafel coming!"}
{"text":"We started having food trucks visit our workplace, overall I'm not impressed.   Loca Popa really impressed me though!

Nothing that fancy.   just a really, really good falafal.   Just about perfect!  delicious, not expensive.   My only complaint?  They only come by two times a month."}
{"text":"So this will be a quick review.
First of all I am a meat-loving, junk eating, if-it's-good-for-you-it's-disgusting kinda guy. Guinness, steak and wings are my preferences. 

That said... holy crap is this food yummy! 

I forgot my lunch and Loca Popa was the truck at our office for the day. So i figured \"what the heck\". I got the traditional plain pita (never had falafel before), and it rocked!  I went back down for hummus and the green machine juice (another \"adventure\" since I'm intimidated by anything with kale in it). 

Long story short, I loved it all. The girls were great too!  I look forward to their truck making its way back to work!"}
{"text":"This place has mostly vegetarian options so it is usually not my top choice. I am a huge fan of hummus, though, and they have some delicious stuff in multiple flavors. I have tried the falafel bites and they were pretty tasty as well."}
