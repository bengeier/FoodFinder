{"text":"This place is amazing. Great authentic Middle Eastern food. The falafel sandwich is my favorite thing on the menu especially since they added the all new vegan sauce. Great ownership and overall great business. Weekly customer for sure."}
{"text":"So I needed a quick bite. They face me a sample of soup to try aka lentil soup and it was so good!  This may be a regular stop for me with this!"}
{"text":"I m new to arizona and me and my family already have a favourite place. What should i say, the food was so good that it reminded my days back at the middle east. We had ordered a lot of dishes as it was our first time. But every dish that we had ordered was equally good and delicious. The family was very kind, friendly and they even gave us complimentary homemade olives which is a must try. 
I will definitely come back to this place and recommend others as well.
This place deserves 5 stars.

Recommendation:
Falafel plate
Chicken saj plate and chicken shawarma sandwich"}
{"text":"Surprising to find such a clean, fresh affordable lunch inside a gas station, great chicken Schwarma, good falafel and they give you pea soup with every order."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place so many times and was passing a diamond in the rough. Excellent service, very clean, and fresh food. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This place is working so hard to prepare great, fresh, delicious food that they deserve everyone's support.  Why would you go to some place that is shelling out prefabbed and frozen food like substances when you could choose Casa De Falafel?  Six fresh salad/mezze options, lentil soup, homemade hot sauce, cooked to order falafel.  We should all be grateful that such quality is available at fast food prices. The falafel is a little different than what I am accustomed too - very light and delicate rather than big and chewy.  It is an interesting shift and I am not sure which I prefer, but no complaints at all.  I really enjoyed it as a pressed sandwich with plenty of pickles and the green hot sauce.  I asked about the mezzes and the woman working gave me(she refused to take any money for it) a small sampler plate with a couple bites of each.  They were all delicious and turned my sandwich and soup into a deluxe meal.  I would encourage them to put that small sampler plate on the menu!  I hope they have great success and can open up another location closer to my normal paths of travel."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots to eat. You cant get this quality food, a this price anywhere else I know of. The family that runs this little restaurant takes a lot of pride in what they do and rightfully so! They are always friendly. Last night they even gave us a small cup of food they made for the family to take home. It was a garbanzo bean soup. It was so nourishing and yummy. I definitely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Decided to try it out because I driven by a few times and it had good reviews. I had the falafel and it was amazing. I will definitely be back. I love little local business and as simple as there menu is it is very tasty and great sized portions."}
{"text":"You would never expect to find  great food in such a place unless you are actually looking to find that wonderful hidden gem you can't wait to tell all your friends about . went in today and was greeted with smiling faces tastes of deliciousness offered with pride and a spotlessly clean kitchen. Please do not hesitate go today and make this wonderful small local business a regular stop."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. I've been on a 30 year quest for the perfect hummus and this place has it!  The food is fantastic and the service is delightful. I think it's kinda cool that it's in a gas station convenience store. It's like this wonderful diamond in the rough that most people probably wouldn't venture into and that's their loss. The brave and adventurous will be rewarded with great food reasonably priced. Your stomach and wallet will thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Glendale! Fresh food, the place is really clean despite being inside a gas station store. I really loved everything I tried there, so far I've tried the flafel, chicken and beef shawarma, and of course their complementary lentil soup is to die for. The service is always friendly. My family seems to agree with me thats our favorite Monday \"to-go\" place. 
The food is freshly made as you order so it might take a while for a big family order to be ready, but you can call them before you head there and they will start your order for you."}
{"text":"Just did a yelp search for some vegan food in the area and I found casa de falafel. I literally passed it because I didn't realize it was inside a gas station which seems odd however after circling around and coming back in a little skeptical I immediately was greeted by a warm friendly owner son who invited me to try the lentil soup and I got a falafel sandwich which was spectacular with the mango sauce couldn't believe when i saw the total bill was $5.79 for a massive amount of food with high-quality ingredients. I will definitely be back here very friendly people family owned business they just got started two months ago I highly recommend when you're on the go give this place a shout this place is excellent hope to see you there"}
{"text":"Well, clearly 5 stars from me doesn't necessarily correlate with some fancy, white tablecloth restaurant...it just means I left happy and will return for more! I didn't expect it to be in a gas station but, I got to fill my tank and my stomach - perfect! Plus, it's one of those clean, and nice gas stations. I got the falafel sandwich and luckily the gentleman making it asked if I wanted the vegan sauce or the 'regular'. Vegan, duh! I think the term sandwich threw me off (I was expecting bread), it's more like a middle eastern burrito pressed with a panini maker so the outside is just the perfect amount of crispy-goodness and the inside is an explosion of flavors. I'll be back, and next time I'm going to make sure to order an extra one to-go so I can bring it back for my hubby to try! So take my advice, look past the fact that it's in a gas station and embrace this hidden gem. P.S. the lentil soup is perfect for this cooler weather."}
{"text":"I love local hole in the wall mom and pop places. I have passed this place many times and because it was in a gas station never bothered to pull over and go in. My fianc√© saw the reviews on yelp and thought why not give it a shot. We went today. The falafel sandwiches were probably the best I have ever had. Full of flavor and not to heavy. 4.50 for a sandwich with a cup of lentil soup? That is hard to find anywhere. I have already told my friend to check it out. We will also be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is great! Wait times are not good though! Plan on spending some time there if you're getting food. Other than that, food is great along with their service! Very hospitable."}
{"text":"Really good portions for the price. We had the falafel sandwich and the chicken shawarma and would order both again. They're both made as a large wrap. It took a little while to get our order, but it was nice and fresh. Service was friendly, too. We will be back."}
{"text":"I just had the best lunch! Don't be afraid that Casa de Falafel is located in a gas station. The five booth restaurant is clean and roomy. I have to admit, the food is so yummy delicious that I would eat here regardless. The falafels are a show stopper. Crispy without being oily and the inside are indescribable. It's a must have ( you will probably call then a bite of heaven). The lentil soup, I am not a lentil soup eater until now. This lentil soup doesn't rely on fat for flavor. The seasoning is the secret of this soup that I'd like to steal. Come with a crowd if you want to try the Beef Saj plate. It's a Mediterranean Burrito, but wayyyy better. The prices are great. This husband and wife team make everything fresh to order. This is not fast food. This is taste and quality worth waiting for and  worth the drive to Peoria."}
{"text":"It's located inside of Shell Gas Station and it's a hidden gem. Fantastic food! Falafel Sandwich is delicious,tasty, & huuuuuuuuge! No Bruno. Vegan options and Meat Eater options. Its a blend of Mediterranean food & American Mexican food. Hummus is delicious and Lentil soup is also. They make delicious smoothies that are with each combo meal BUT They do add sugar to smoothies, So I asked for my smoothie to have no sugar."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything in this small restaurant located in a gas station.  Yes, a gas station.

From the hummus, to the exquisite tasting falafel, to the chicken shawarma wrap (my personal favorite); everything is delicious.  Also, don't forget to try their lentil soup, perhaps the best I've ever had to date, so creamy and full of flavor.

They also sell American food here so it's kind of like a fusion with its French fries and hamburgers etc.  service is great and food does take a little wait, but you won't be disappointed with it.

Parking isn't plentiful as it's a gas station, but I've never had an issue with parking.  The sitting area had maybe 4-5 small tables and I've always been able to find a seat.

Definitely a gem in the hood."}
{"text":"Hands down best and freshest Falafel I have ever had makes it easy being vegan when the food is so delicious for sure going to be my go to spot thank you for being open and so friendly"}
{"text":"The food is freshly made and may take some time. Call in your order if you want it faster. Delicious food and great service"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, fresh, new take on old standbys
 You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Found my new lunch spot. First time there and I picked up Chicken Shwarma Sandwich. Eager to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The sandwich was great.  Such a surprising little gem for being inside a gas station!  I only wish they would sell hummus or have an expanded menu.  Options are a bit limited, but everything I've had is good."}
{"text":"Very clean place . 
Food taste the best I've never had one complain about what they do . By the way I eat there everyday . I work across the street from them and they the best option I see ."}
{"text":"Wow! I saw it was in a gas station so I almost turned around. Little did I know this place was going to be my fav favorite! I got the felafel sandwich. Even came with free soup. So much flavor and bang for your buck. Well deserved."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, best lentil soup EVER!!! Always a friendly staff. Convenient and fast! Wish the sold gyros."}
{"text":"Casa De Falafel in located in a Shell Gas Station. They serve up Falafels and Mexican Style Food in a Chipotle Style Fashion. When I was there they offered samples but weren't big on describing the food. My husband asked them what was a Fez Burrito and the man behind the counter said to look at the moving TV screen instead of telling us what was in the Fez Burrito.

I ordered a Falafel Plate.
The Falafels are unlike any falafel I ever had. 
They are very crisp and crunchy with a bread-like fluffy interior and coated with sesame seeds.
They are made with a combination of chick peas and fava (broard) beans.
The amount of seasoning in them was very scant and coriander, cumin, garlic and fresh parsley were not noticeably present.
The dominate flavor of the falafel was sesame seeds.
I didn't notice any pita bread being offered here.

Hummus and tahini were on the bland side and lacked a fresh tasting ingredient to add life and make them bright tasting like they should be. 

My husband ordered the Chicken Mexican Bowl with Hot sauce. The woman working there said she didn't know what sauce was hot sauce. By looking at the menu we had to figure out ourselves that the red sauce should have been hot sauce.The chicken in the bowl was nicely prepared but the cilantro rice lacked enough cilantro to give give off a cilantro flavor. The hot sauce was made with fresh tasting tomatoes but lacked any heat. I think it was made with tomatoes and green bell peppers.

Although they proudly display a grade \"A\" Health inspection I can tell you the falafels, chicken and rice were all at room temperature and would not have passed a health inspection when I was there.

At the time of this review this restaurant has only been open a short time and might improve in time."}
{"text":"There is nowhere more capable of creating scrumptious Mediterranean food of consistent quality! This family-owned corner in the Shell makes all of their food with a loving, careful hand. 
My family savors everything we've ever eaten here--even the baby devours the lentil soup like it's the best thing he's ever eaten. (It probably is!). 
Try the 16 Oz. Assorted platter. Wonderful baba ghanouj, jajeek, tabouli and others. You won't be disappointed. 
There are burgers, fries and cheese crisp for unadventurous. 
The little seating area is always spotless. Their smiles are as authentic as their food. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Don't discount this place because it's in a gas station! Every time I am in Peoria I stop here. I wish it were closer to where I live! This is amazing Mediterranean Food and as a Vegan they have so many great options. I always get the Falafel Sandwich. The service is amazing, family owned, and homemade tahini sauces. They treat you like family. I recommend this 100% and would give 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"The best falafel I've ever had in the US. If you're deciding on trying this place, please be mindful that this is probably nothing like you tried before! This falafel is done Iraqi style with the exception of using tortilla bread. The falafel is done perfectly, the lentil soup is a must have and the tamarind juice... oh I have no words for that, it's just flavorful and fresh! Only the nicest family ever running this place! They are super friendly, clean and generous! 

I must also mention that they have THE BEST IRAQI APPETIZERS ever.. hands down! You must try their baba ganoush, jajeek, humus in the exact order ;) they are done a little better than they are done in Iraq I promise! Only problems is that they only make them on Friday and Saturday. 

Finally, you can take their falafel recipe home, it's very well neatly packaged!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I found it on Yelp and have been three times. Each time was wonderful. The owners are the sweetest people. Each time they have given me a free sample of lentil soup or homemade lemonade. Their food is great and unbelievably inexpensive. I love their signature falafel sandwich which is a huge grilled wrap with falafel, hummus, tahini, pickle, lettuce and tomato inside. It is enough for two people but I always eat the whole thing! Their lentil soup is great too. The seating area and the whole Shell station is impeccably clean. As other reviewers have said, it is truly a hidden gem. I hope others will try it because these people deserve to succeed. I now start craving their food every couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Friendly faces, delicious falafel and lentil soup, super spicy sauce packs a punch without overwhelming other flavors!"}
{"text":"What a treat to get to eat falafel for lunch here today!  The owner/chef was so kind and nice to let my hubby and I try the falafel and sauces before we ordered.  We ordered the falafel sandwiches, and they were scrumptious!!!  We loved the lentil soup that comes with the sandwiches as well.  We are visiting from Texas, but if we lived in Phoenix, we would be regulars at this jewel of a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot! Go there twice a week. The falafel sandwich and the hummus is solo good! Everything is always fresh made!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical because it is inside a gas station, but at the recommendation of a friend, I decided to give it a try. I was very surprised! The place was spotless, the people were very friendly and pleasant, and the food was fabulous! 
We had some of their lentil soup to start, and I could have eaten a gallon of it. It was very different from other lentil soups I've had and very tasty!
I also had the falafel sandwich and fries. Both were very good and convinced me to put this place on my list of regular eateries. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Flavorful n purely delicious in every letter of the word. Take a bite of anything on their menu and the flavors envelope your pallet like a paint brush best place to know cause you're in the know. Wouldn't hesitate to have a grub out session on anything they have to offer"}
{"text":"Considering I'm new to the vegitarian lifestyle...I'm ALWAYS looking for new ways! And this place was delisous!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Do not let that it is inside a gas station fool you!! Everything I have had is fresh and filling. I love that they make everything right there in front of you! Fast and friendly service. Simple menu and even have pictures of you are new to Mediterranean food. I highly recommend the Falafel Sandwich my son who can be a picky eater always gets the Beef Shawarma sandwich ."}
{"text":"the family that owns this little falafel place is really nice! I got the falafel sandwich which comes with fresh made falafel that they press in a grill. I asked for lentil soup also and was given a little sample which was also perfect for a chilly day! 

Everything is homemade and they even have a YouTube channel to teach you how make their signature falafel. Really the best! They have a simple menu with a variety of healthy or hearty options."}
{"text":"Some of the best falafel I've ever had!! I am very selective when it comes to Middle Eastern food due to living with a Middle Eastern family. This falafel is very authentic! Plus, I love supporting local businesses. Today I tried the shourba (lentil soup), chicken shawarma sandwich and falafel. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Casa De Falafel.  I was skeptical. In a Shell Gas station, c'mon.  WOW! So glad I came.  Lentil soup served with sandwiches is delicious. You can also get a bowl.  I ordered the Falafel sandwich with 1 line of hot Green sauce.  It was spicy but not overwhelming, but if you don't like hot, go for the milder Red sauce.  This is my 2nd time in 3 days. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. Give this place a try. You will love it!"}
{"text":"This place was a nice unexpected surprise. Try out their mango pickle sauce if you're here! It's the right mix of spicy and tangy. If you like hot sauce their hot sauce is also pretty amazing. 

The people behind the counter are super friendly and asked a lot of questions about what we liked so they could make it the way we wanted.

Overall an oasis in the middle of a gas station. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their lentil soup. It hits the spot and is affordable! It's something I crave and am so glad it's close to me!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with all the other yelpers.  A little gem at the Shell station. Think it was a Shell, was so focused on going inside. I love falafel so had to try this place. The falafel sandwich in my opinion was just delicious. Not like your typical Greek version which I also adore. Plenty of other things on the menu too. Complimentary lentil soup to try while they make your lunch. Also delicious. Needed coffee too, so got that while I waited. Fresh and hot. Win win for me today."}
{"text":"Drove about 25 mins to try this place based solely on the great reviews. Imagine the surprise to drive up and see it is attached to the corner gas station. Yes that is correct. Figured that the food must have earned it the great rep. I figured correctly. 

Falafel was hands down the best I have found in he valley to date. Slightly crispy on the outside soft and flavorful on the inside. Delicious! We had the sandwich and the plate all the sauces were yummy, particularly enjoyed the hot sauce, and ingredients were very fresh. The man behind the counter was very friendly and happy to help, even gave us a sample to try. 

They should be very proud of what they do, have found nothing as good anywhere else in Phoenix. Brings back memories of London Falafel eating. Don't be put off by the humble appearance, great food awaits you!"}
{"text":"There isn't too much new to be said about Casa De Falafel. We visited based on positive vegan reviews, and were not disappointed. We ordered two falafel sandwiches, fries and hummus. It was a huge amount of food for under $20. It was also excellent!

The falafel sandwich is in a tortilla, grilled like a panini. I was skeptical at first since I'm used to pita, but I'm a believer now. I liked that it was less bread, and crispy on the outside. It also held together much better than a pita. The falafels were freshly made and cooked well - crispy on the outside, warm inside. I don't like tahini (more on that later) so the person who took my order (who I assume was the owner) offered me a side of a mango sauce instead. The falafels also came with a small cup of delicious lentil soup, and a side of a unique, slightly spicy sauce that was a perfect complement to the falafels. 

The fries were thin and crisp - just how we like them. I can't comment too much on the hummus because I was too full from the soup, falafels and fries, but the few bites I had were great. I'll have the leftover hummus for dinner tonight!

As mentioned in other reviews, the owner couldn't have been more nice. He did give me a hard time about not liking tahini on my falafels, and still gave me some on the side (which my husband enjoyed) but he asked if we were vegan (probably because of the \"give peas a chance\" shirt I was wearing) and was very sweet. 

We enjoyed our visit and will go back when we have the opportunity to be in the Glendale/Peoria area!"}
{"text":"Glad I listened to the reviews and checked this place out!  Tried the falafel sandwich and French fries. Both were excellent and the service was  friendly and professional. The complimentary lentil soup was delicious."}
{"text":"Oh my...I seriously can't get over how delicious the food is here. Hands down the best falafel sandwich and hummus I've ever had. They also include a small cup of lentil soup with your meal which is so yummy. The owners/staff always have a very pleasant demeanor. I've been here 4-5 times and it has always been a perfect experience! If you haven't tried this place yet, you are definitely missing out!!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best middle eastern food in Arizona. Iraqi style food it the best middle eastern food. The falafel is done right and it's not greasy. Their shawerma is probably the best I've had state side."}
{"text":"The sandwich is very good. It's really big and worth the $5. Just missing some hummus/ tahini flavor. But overall the restaurant is also very clean and has good service. The people there are very nice. Looking forward to eating here again"}
{"text":"This place was seriously amazing! My husband and I have been driving past it for a month, we were both a little skeptical because it was inside a gas station, but decided to have lunch because the reviews  were great. We were not disappointed! I got the falafel sandwich, the falafel were moist and melt in your mouth! My husband got the  steak fez burrito which he loved. The steak was tender and the flavors  were great. While eating they offered us samples of the lentil soup. I liked it so much I bought a bowl for lunch tomorrow! This place is awesome, don't let the fact of it being in a gas station  stop you."}
{"text":"An amazing place & clean to have a nice meal.
Try the beef shawrma sandwich is the best ."}
{"text":"I've never eaten falafel before but I was on this part of town and thought I'd try out this lil Mediterranean joint. Don't be fooled by its gas station proximity...I had to make a U turn haha. Anyways, when I walked up to the counter I told the last that I never had falafel before and asked how it tastes. She was very nice and offered me a free sample of the falafel ball w tahini(spelling?). It was of course delicious! The rest of the transaction was pleasant and the falafel sandwich I ordered was great too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They did a great job redoing the restaurant and the food is fresh and very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!  It all tastes homemade and so fresh!  Smart to offer a small complimentary serving of their lentil soup FOR FREE!  It is some of the best soup I have ever had!  I will for sure crave it and be back for more!  

Now, for their service.  So friendly and warm!  

This is a hidden gem in Peoria, for sure!  We moved to the neighborhood about a year ago and so happy to have finally tried their food.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the gas station fool you... this place ROCKS!! This is probably one of my favorite fast pace restaurants in Phoenix! Ali & Mida are incredible and always go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. Their food is absolutely delicious and I've never had anything I didn't love. 

I highly recommend the falafel sandwich or the chicken shawerma! And the garlic and tahini sauces are amazing additions!"}
{"text":"Really good. Quick and tasty for a vegetarian meal. Staff are kind and helpful. It is inside of a gas station so I was hesitant but it was worth it. I go back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Really wish I could give this place five stars! The food is amazing and the service is absolutely on par with it. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because nobody really wants to eat inside of the gas station. If you don't mind the awkward gas station environment, this place definitely deserves five stars"}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly staff! We were getting dinner to go, but it would be fine to eat in as it is very clean and comfortable. Being vegan, I was very happy that I didn't even have to ask my typical questions, as she asked me first and the proceeded to tell me what was and wasn't vegan. Did I say they were friendly? And helpful!"}
{"text":"Freshest food around, made with love and passion. Service is marvelous. And the place is very clean.  Make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic find.  The name \"Casa de Falafel\" totally got our attention with uproarious laughter but after reading some of reviews we knew we had try it.  The food totally lives up to the hype. The falafel sandwich is amazing - crispy and light falafel with typical sandwich fixings and hummus as the spread (I think).  Served warm and crispy. Hummus really is some of the best I have ever had but I do wish the accompanying pita had been warmed. It isnt fast food in that it took a few minutes but it was well worth the short wait but it would be easy to take with you and relative safe to eat in your car if you're in a hurry. I cant rave enough. The restaurant is clean and unassuming - it is in a gas station afterall - and the kitchen spotless. Staff were courteous, patient and kind. Prices were low and more than reasonable for the quality of the food. Definitely going to make this one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Lentil soup-Vegan, complementary & Delicious!Great customer service! Clean establishment. Located inside the shell station. Generous portions size. We had the falafel  sandwich & chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Now this is the BOMB!!! Lentil soup, falafal and hummus my favorite!!  I wish they had bigger size soup.  I have to buy 2 large once cuz it is just that goooood!  And to mix in the spicy green sauce they have OMG tooooo die for!! I am soooo happy they are just down the street!  I hope they become so great they will have to open a restaurant like Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"On our most recent spring training trip, my buddy and I needed a quick bite in between games and decided to give Casa De Falafel a shot.

Don't let the shell gas station fa√ßade scare you away--no joke, this was easily one of the best meals during our trip.

I ordered the $7 beef shawerma sandwich (mild spice level) and was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary cup of lentil soup that came with it. Both items were delicious. Between the perfectly seasoned beef and the fresh pickle/tomato/onion, the sandwich was super flavorful. I like hot food and the mild spice level was enough to give my lips a pleasant burn.

The lentil soup was also incredibly tasty. Next time, I'll probably order a bowl because it was THAT good.

My buddy ordered french fries which were solid yet unremarkable. But with mediterranean food this good, who cares?

Additionally, the service was friendly (and quick!) and the seating area was clean.

Simply put, Casa De Falafel tops my list of restaurants to revisit on future spring training trips."}
{"text":"I love finding great eats in interesting locations . At first I was hesitant about eating in a gas station. Will there be enough seating? Will it be clean? But I was pleasantly surprised by the clean and spacious seating area.

Our food was a nice surprise as well from the complimentary lentil soup to the homemade lemonade. I had the falafel sandwich and my boyfriend had the chicken swarma. Both were tasty, huge, and way better than we expected. I liked that the hummus on it which had a nice tahini flavor and we both really enjoyed the cucumbers and pickles inside our sandwiches. I saw another couple ordered a side of pickles? That's happening next time. Oh, and shoestring fries! Yum!

The only downside is that this is a bit of a drive for us to get to buy that is on us for not buying a house closer to this fantastic restaurant. 

Good work guys. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious, nice & clean!  I love the tabouli and they are super duper friendly. This is a great neighborhood place in a gas station by my sister, I wish there was one by me!"}
{"text":"Friendly mom and pop shop and good food! I got the beef shawarma and that was pretty tasty. The location is in the gas station."}
{"text":"Who would have thought?! An amazing place for authentic Mediterranean food...inside a Shell gas station. Don't let the location fool you. This is great, healthy food. Friendly staff and unbeatable prices. Can't figure why you even think of fast food when you could eat here. We live in Scottsdale and will make this a regular stop when in the west side. The falafel is a must-have."}
{"text":"This is by far my new favorite food place. Don't let the gas station setting fool you. This place is super clean, and the food is amazing!!! Not only that, the FAMILY running this place is extremely polite, and understands what it means to serve great food. I have been here twice in the last month and my second visit was even better then the first. Unfortunately, I ate my food before I could take a picture, and my kids and wife helped. 

5 STARS!!!! Hands Down

Feb.13, 2018
I'm back a Month later to add some photos. I've been there 3 times since my last review but always eat before I take a picture. Here it is!!!"}
{"text":"Wow AMAZING! Such fresh and amazing Falafel!

Thank you- you have satisfied this picky and pregnant Mom"}
{"text":"A good pal of mine mentioned the 'outstanding'lentil soup in this family owned operation. Well, for starters it appears to simply be a filling station (gas)/Mimi mart as has been mentioned by other reviewers. To the left when you enter is a mini cafe/eatery across from the grill/kitchen area. Seemed quite busy and buzzing with clientele.
After seeing Ali use the panini press and prepare a Shewarma, I was more than inclined to get one of the beef ones (they offer it w/chicken too). What intrigued me was all the veg and seasoning he throws on before he wraps it up. He handed me a complimentary bowl of the lentil soup and a falafel while I waited for my order. One bite and I tasted miditerranean authenticity beckoning my taste buds, lol!
The service was exemplary, food immensely satisfying and a desire to make it a regular stop any time I had a craving or simply a nagging for a bite to eat and savor. Very friendly and courteous family eatery in the hood. Luckily it's on my beaten path practically half the time I venture out. Like they say fill the belly and the tank with one quick stop.
Need I say more. So, that's what's for dinner tonite. Washes down well w/any beer, wine or other choice. Always take home some of their rich, flavorful sauces and a bowl of that homemade lentil soup. Devine! I'd want to try their whole menu and the mango sauce and tamarind juice.
Oh, and I'm throwing in the five shiny ones topped off by the Sun&Moon too. How's that for going the extra mile as they did for me? Cheers!"}
{"text":"The pictures do not do this falafel Justice! How is it that they can get the ball so perfect, fluffy, crisp, not to burn sesame in the deep fryer? I'm not sure...But they do it and it's fabulous! I tried their lentil soup and their chicken shawarma both met and exceeded my expectations this is it my new favorite spot to eat out :-) even though it's in a gas station \")"}
{"text":"Totally forgot to leave a review for this place. They serve very fresh Mediterranean style food here. Every time I come they offer me free falafel. The falafel is perfect, not dry at all. The portions are perfect, and the price is cheap. This is a hidden gem inside a gas station, yet their seating area is always clean. I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was here with a couple friends last week. Super taste and inexpensive. Loved it. Wished I hadn't eaten earlier that day so I could have had more.  The lentil soup was awesome. The Gyro sandwich was awesome.  My vegan friend enjoyed the Falafel sandwich. Couldn't resist ordering some falafel for the road."}
