{"text":"The event here was weeks ago and I can't stop thinking about the godamned risotto. Seriously. This sh!t just about gave me an existential crisis. 

Maybe that probably doesn't sound good to you, but consider this: when was the last time a a few ounces of rice even gave you gastronomic pause? Exactly, it's a side dish. It's just a cheap way to fill plates at Italian joints. Right?

Well, frack me sideways, not anymore. Chef Peters' risotto made me question my existence and its meaning. Maybe you're a veteran, a risotto enthusiast. Heretofore I'd have written this off as downmarket, but now I think about risotto. It's appearance is understated, uncomely even. It's this greyish, nearly non-Newtonian ooze that occupies the dish without much authority. On its way to the tables of other patrons, it gently releases steam that will raise the eyebrow of the more olfactory inclined among us. They can't quite place why, but they know they need it.

I'm not even going to tell you what it tasted like. Just hope it's there when you go."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The pasta is the bomb - great noodles, light meaty sauce, with a hint of lemon. Also highly recommend the s'mores - they are awesome. And the people are great, too- what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delightful, well-seasoned, and filling, if not altogether healthy, Sunday brunch here. My wife and I enjoy trying different restaurants in the Smallman incubator, and this one was a pleasant surprise.

We arrived at opening and were the first or second customers of the day, so there was no waiting. If you are trying to get brunch on the strip, that alone is a nice bonus. Food arrived in a reasonable time.

I had the Fried Chicken Biscuit.  It was served on a flaky biscuit, with white Southern-style gravy, two eggs over medium, and spicy (not too spicy) fried chicken with a thick and crunchy cereal-style crust.  Fist impressions and overall memory of the dish was that it was delicious. Not a bad bite in there, really.  Only two minor complaints about the dish. First would be that I would have liked a bit more black pepper in the gravy, and at a bit coarser grain. The chicken had a tiny kick to it, but not enough that the gravy didn't need that little extra spice I'm accustomed to. Living in the South may have also influenced my opinion on my other piece of feedback, which is that I would really have preferred a southern-style biscuit. The one they served tasted great, but the gravy in my mind calls for a biscuit that crumbles and flakes in a certain way.  Eggs were cooked just the way I like them without my having to ask, a slight runnyness in the yolks. Priced at $17, it's what you should expect for Smallman, and portions were above average for there.

Considering everything, very good dish. Recommended."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor at Smallman. On my first visit I tried the S'mores dessert at Brunoise and fell in love.

This review is a thank you to one of my closet friends and Brunoise for surprising me with one of the last S'more desserts on my last day of work! You went out of your way to make it happen clearly displaying a genuine care for your customers. You guys rock! 

While I am so sad to see the S'mores off the menu, I am excited to try the next creation! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We visited Smallman Galley for Sunday brunch, and though I struggled for a few minutes deciding which great booth to visit I was sold when I saw the fried chicken with biscuits and gravy at Brunoise.  Each bite was the than the last.  The base of home made biscuits was the perfect blend of dense and fluffy, the sausage gravy was loaded with flavor, the gooey yolk of the perfectly cooked sunny side up egg added a deliciousness to the already amazing gravy.  Then to top it all off was a punch of mellow spice in the perfectly crispy and moist fried chicken thigh.  It was by far one of the best brunch meals I've ever had.  Can't wait to go back and try other options there, although it will be tough not to go back to this amazing dish!"}
{"text":"The Chicken and Biscuits at Brunoise is one of the best things at Smallman Galley right now. Every aspect of it makes you want more, and if you can get your hands on it, you absolutely should. They seem to sell out of this item pretty regularly but hopefully they will be able to stabilize their inventory. Until then, I suggest you get here before 11am."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the mushroom omelet this morning and had high expectations from all the good reviews and beautiful photos. I ended up disappointed, with an omelette that was generally lackluster. The mushrooms weren't bad but I felt their flavor was underdeveloped and they could have been sauteed more prior to being added in. I paid an extra dollar for cheese to be added and it was a very average bright orange cheddar that I didn't think fit well with the mushrooms. They included a side salad with the omelette, which I'm pretty sure was just mixed greens with balsamic and oil. For $14 this meal didn't meet expectations and overall was probably marginally better than something from Denny's."}
{"text":"This was a good meal. Not great, but good. I don't think I would return again with all of the selection in the area but not bad. 

I had the special burger - French Onion burger. The  burgers are pre-cooked to med rare and then vacuum sealed and in a water bath. I think this may be a bit of what turned me off. I like a rare burger and just feel like as quickly as a burger cooks, they should be able to cook it fresh, when ordered. It had a lot of saut√©ed onions, they had good flavor - much like french onion soup, so the taste was spot on.

It came with greens on the side. Nothing exciting. Just a handful of spring mix. 

The cost was $14."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for quite some time now and finally decided to make the trip to the Strip for lunch this week. I went with their fried chicken sandwich, which I heard amazing things about, and ordered it to-go. The sandwich itself was super tasty- crispy chicken, fresh pickles, soft bun, butter leaf lettuce, and a hint of celery seed in the aioli- SO good. However, I was hoping I would get a little bit more flavor from the hot honey, my tastebuds were missing that little kick that I was expecting from the sandwich description. The chicken sandwich came with some mixed greens with a house made vinaigrette, which really complimented the sandwich. For over $14, this was one of the priciest chicken sandwiches I've ever had, however, it was pretty good. I look forward to coming back and trying something else!"}
{"text":"so I saw the picture of the banana walnut pancakes on IG...they looked yum
I decided Sunday am I am going to eat these today
so my bff said ok lets go
we thankfully were able to find parking in the strip district always a challenge on a weekend 
we walk down the block um ...where is Brunoise ?
we walk the other way ...and walk into Smallman Gallery because the number matches
ahh you see this is a \"gallery\" of eateries that all share the same space
its counter you pick which \"restaurant\" you want to order from
get a number 
there are many tables in the main section and tables in the back 
the whole place is really noisy 
there is a bar and Commonplace (see their own review) coffee on the other side for beverages and coffees plus some of the \"restaurants \" have their own
Brunoise has a white board of their offerings
burger and and the pancakes I ordered 
um 12 dollars ...
I took my number to my rustic table 
there are carafes of water and glasses set out on every table that is a nice gesture
my cakes arrived
they were piping hot and delish
this waS short stack right...two average size cakes with nuts and bananas yes delish and I add again 12 dollars
a little steep for two pancakes of average size"}
{"text":"THIS DESSERT KILLLLLS ME. I watched the guy make this with patience and perfection each time. I appreciate the dedication and attention to detail. Y'all can't order this anymore sorry. But it was a deconstructed s'mores concept. Looked the same every time he prepared it. Chocolate smoked meringue, Millie's graham cracker ice cream. Heheheheheh"}
{"text":"Keep an eye on this place. I'm pretty sure Chef Ryan is going to become a household name. His dishes are of \"fine-dining\" quality but there's not an ounce of pretentiousness. I tried the Brunoise burger and wow was it delicious! The patty was sous vide (genius) and the result was a totally juicy, totally thick, and perfectly medium rare burger. The bun held up which was also very impressive. It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  I also got to try the soon to be famous s'mores dessert and I fell in love. I can't wait to see what else Brunoise has in store!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot, and I mean A LOT, of cheeseburgers from across the country and Europe, and the burger from Brunoise was far and away the best burger I have EVER had. The burger itself was so juicy and flavorful! The bun was soft and fresh. The combo of the cheeses and other toppings just meshed so well together. I am salivating just writing this review!!!
I also ordered the Smores dessert after seeing and hearing a lot of buzz surrounding it. It was fabulous! The chocolate was divine AND it had Millie's ice cream---I lean what else do you need, right?
To top it all off, the chef was super nice! 
I'll happily go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Brunoise is near perfect ... 4.5 stars

Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.

Brunoise is quite different from it's environment... it's fine dining ... in a food hall.  Different... absolutely.   After going to the Revival (Chicago), Torvehallerne (Copenhagen), and a bunch of other ones around the world, Brunoise does stand out as it gives refinement in an otherwise energetic, often hectic, and loud space.  The plating alone tells you that there's definitely attention to detail that you don't see in other food halls and it really does look quite stunning on the plate.  

I wish I could have said I bought my meal here but I didnt... I did buy dessert though and it made me realize that I should have bought my ENTIRE meal here to try.  It takes a lot of bravery (or craziness) to rethink a beloved childhood treat and reinvent it a bit to a refined dessert.  

S'mores - I remember it being a gooey sticky delicious mess of chocolate, caramelized sugar, vanilla, and graham.  I loved how the bruleed meringue captured that spirit while the chocolate is super creamy and a very rich mousse like texture... something akin to the melted chocolate except it doesnt burn your mouth.  And the fine crumbed graham sitting underneath some nice ice cream.  I have to admire his thoughts and definitely the amazing plating.  My only little comment would be about the ice cream ... I couldnt really discern much flavour other than it being sweet.  Even with the minor comment, I would say this was the best dessert of my PGH experience and would order it again 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Very different brunch experience. Who knew this place is next door to Pamela's !!its a series of stations of various small menus. You order from a blackboard at whichever station you want food from. You pay, they give you a number on a stand, and bring you the food. Very confusing, but delicious. My friend had brunois brunch meal of banana walnut pancakes. I had colonia brunch Mota Pilla a savory mixture of eggs, chorizo, sauce, beans with little thin pitas. Yummy!! Commonplace coffee set off a great meal!! Will come again."}
{"text":"Chef Ryan Peters has served up great meals during his tenure at Smallman Galley. His creations exhibit much creativity on his part. Having finished dinner my husband and I stopped over to order dessert from him.

We wanted the s'mores that he was noted for but on his menu board it was crossed out with the letters. RIP. Chef Ryan explained to me that he wanted people to see variation in his menu and there created a new dessert called lemon meringue tart with grape sorbet.

We ordered that and chef Ryan personally brought them out to us. I have always been impressed with his presentation of food and this did not disappoint. The tart was delicious! The grape sorbet was good but I did miss the Millie's ice cream he used when he made the s'mores.

Knowing Brunoise will be ending it's tenure here at Smallman Galley at the end of May I asked Chef Ryan about his future plans. He told me he has nothing right now.

For those of you who love Smallman Galley I would encourage you to come back for one last go round before this 2nd group of chefs graduate and move on to their future ventures. Brunch is served on Sundays and the regular menu the rest of the week."}
{"text":"I've loved the concept of Smallman Galley since it opened and always make an effort to get in and try each place in the restaurant incubator. About a month ago, I went to SG and ordered a few things- one being from Brunoise. It was so delicious and well-crafter, that my boyfriend and I decided to head back the following morning and try out their brunch menu. BEST PANCAKES EITHER OF US HAVE EVER EATEN... and I have a crazy sweet tooth so believe me when I say that that is a statement.

Moving forward- my boyfriend's birthday was coming up in two weeks and I wanted to do something special. I reached out to Chef Ryan Peters via social media asking if there was any possibility that he could help me out. Even while traveling, he responded very promptly and was enthusiastic about putting together something special for the two of us. Within a few days, he had put together a dinner menu- while keeping my budget in mind. He even went as far as to print out personalized menus wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday and reserving a table of our choice. He personally came out and served us each of the five courses and explained in detail what ingredients were used, where they were sourced from, and how the dish was crafted. His attention to detail in presentation (on and off of the plate) was magnificent. When the 5th course came out, the desert had special writing on it (see photos) as requested. Chef Ryan even went the extra mile and gave us each a free macaron... and then included three more in a small sample box for us to take home along with our leftovers. Each course was magnificent, the portions were large, and we do not have enough wonderful things to say about Chef Ryan and his Brunoise staff. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Do you like fried chicken? What about biscuits and gravy? If so, please do yourself a favor and try this outstanding plate of goodness ASAP. The chicken is perfectly fried and incredibly juicy, and the gravy is well seasoned."}
