{"text":"I was very excited that a new location was added on my route home. I had high hopes and it was all for nothing. It all started by waiting about 10min in line, by myself, no one else around me customer wise... Before I was even acknowledged. While waiting, I noticed how messy The food area was. Sauces had other sauces in their containers.. Meat was in the veggies, veggies were in the meats.. What the hell. So moving on.. The only reason why someone came to take my order is because the guy cutting dough noticed I was there a while standing. I was never greeted. No one smiled. I didn't even get a \"hello\". The girl came to the counter and asked what I would have you could already tell by the attitude that my visit wasn't going to go as planned. I ordered garlic sticks and three pizzas. The first one I had asked to be chicken bacon ranch. At this point two other girls came to assist the first girl. One of the newly joined girls says \"well it's a build your own, so you can choose what you want\". I understand. I know how it works. I was just forewarning you what I wanted on my first one. I didn't think anything of it when I told them what I wanted. At this point, I didn't want the food any longer but I was in too deep and would hope the rest of the time went better. I was wrong. After finally walking through my entire order, I get to the cash register. I was going to purchase a gift card to receive a free pizza. The person cashing me out didn't seem too interested in anything other than telling me my third sauce would be extra. Okay. So I just paid my bill and moved along to wait for my food. Being overly aggravaged.. I noticed my pizzas were removed and added back to the oven more than once. One was under done and one was overcooked - we had noticed once I was home. While I waited, I noticed that a new customer came behind me and was able to get her pizza going in a jiffy. She checked out right behind me and the cashier offered the gift card option to her so she would get the free pizza. She was even able yo use the gift card with that purchase after the card transaction was completed. \"Whatever\", I thought. I rolled my eyes and continued to wait and watch. When asked if I wanted any sauce on top of the pizzas, I said yes to ranch for one and pesto for another.. you would think they wanted to cover the entire thing. The sauce was overloaded without a care. The basil leaves were not added to the margarita pizza.. My boxes were placed on top for me to grab and that was that. I wasn't told to \"have a nice day\". No one said \"thank you\". No one said \"okay you're all set\". No one smiled. There was no one else here during my visit until the very end when I checked out. I honestly think they took their time on purpose. It was the longest process of my life. Very disappointed with my entire visit. The four female workers there either really hate their jobs or had someone piss in their cheerios that day. I will only be visiting the madison location feom here on forward. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I was initially Unsure how to take a pizza that's cooked in 4 minutes. Turns out a take it slice by slice and Gorge myself. Well they haven't had their official grand opening yet, my family stopped in there to get a couple of pizzas and I was pleasantly surprised to find out they also had beers. We decided to get Roto blonde ale which I wish I could actually find in stores because it's that good it's brewed by a Brewing Company somewhere out of Madison. the kids got a standard pepperoni and sausage pizza while my wife and I got the buffalo chicken pizza. We had them on the process for ordering it cuz it's a little different but it's kind of like Chipotle for pizza where you go down the line and tell him what you want on it. They seem to stick pretty close with their portions which is fine because the pizzas aren't actually that big I don't think there's any bigger than 10 in. That's what she said. No sooner did we pay and sit down did they call us and tell us that our pizzas were ready? How the heck is that possible? But true to their word quick Fired Pizza means quick as hell. It's kind of serve yourself as far as napkins and silverware goes and they do have a soda fountain thing. Cool part is they have some boxes stacked up so you don't have to go ask for a box for your unfinished pizza and yes I had a couple slices I did not finish. So we will definitely back my only wish is that maybe they had larger pizzas but given the quick-fire format in the size of the oven I don't think that's going to happen."}
{"text":"Heard quite a bit of rave about this place ... had my first experience tonight at the Concord location.

Overall experience was average. Service was good - was nice to see young high school kids working and they did a nice job explaining how the ordering worked. They are definitely not understaffed here. I thought the pizza itself was good to average. It's thin, but the ingredients are good and the sauce and taste definitely fulfills that pizza craving.  Pizza didn't seem to be cut very well - we had to recut every piece. 

We ordered a sausage/pepperoni - which was good. We also ordered a half buffalo chicken and half  butter/garlic white sauce w various toppings. My husband loved the butter/garlic. I thought buffalo was ok - but it only had 5 pieces of chicken on entire half. If chicken pieces were smaller - maybe it would have been better, but most bites were of cheese and sauce. 

We also ordered the cheese sticks thinking they were the round sticks. This was just like eating a cheese pizza - just cut into strips and not pizza slices. We ordered ranch and Alfredo as dipping sauces. The Alfredo was ice cold - pulled right out of the refrig. Who serves Alfredo sauce ice cold? I paid an extra .79 each for two new sides since it was not good. The garlic butter dipping sauce was better - but also pulled right out of the refrigerator. In my opinion- butter and Alfredo should not be served cold. Overall, would not order the cheese sticks again. 

We don't live far so would definitely do a to-go in a pinch, but this didn't out-do our local favorite. It's also a quick, informal dinner if you have kids and don't want to wait on a 30 minute pizza."}
{"text":"All of the ingredients have a bunch of cross contamination. I found bacon and chicken in my vegetarian salad. They use the same tongs to toss the salads. Pieces of one ingredient falls into the box of the next. If you have a food allergy or preference to abstain from anything on the food line do not eat here. I repeatedly told them I was a vegetarian and ended up with several types of meat in my salad."}
{"text":"I don't even have to go to this particular roto to tell you if it's anything like the Madison one your in for a treat I think this is the future of pizza look out chain pizza places pizza roto it's taking over.
 Stopped in once and same great quality. This pizza place is very popular one the madison one staff is very friendly and it's a lot of fun to build a pizza and watch them cook it I brought Amish there to eat and they loved it and were amazed that the pizza wasn't expensive and the pizza was cooked so fast."}
