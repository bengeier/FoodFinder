{"text":"We seriously won't go anywhere else for chinese food! Whether its dine in or take out the service and food are quick! Very family friendly and make my children feel welcomed. We wish it was closer but dont mind the 25 minute drive at all! Excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken egg rolls are delish as is the chicken fried rice. Low mein and orange chicken is also great! Always Tastes fresh ....Best Chinese food our family has found in the Gilbert area so far. Prices very reasonable for the portion sizes given."}
{"text":"I love Chinese.. And based on the rating and proximity to my job I decided to try it. The food fell short of my expectations completely. I've tried it twice just to be sure and was disappointed both times. Taste was just off on what seemed like everything. Lacked flavor and breaking was by far too too much on the deep fried dishes. I have tried the combination rice, chow fun, sesame shrimp and sweet and sour chicken. It's in a great location for business since its in medical district and with a vas menu I'm sure it does great but the food quality was just poor for me"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving for a good fried rice, I go to this place... If you like it spicy, make sure you ask for it... And you can ask them to add salted fish in it too... (not in the menu).... Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I would rather drive out of my way, than go back.  Messed up order and then they were rude about fixing it.  After years of patronage, I will not go back.  I got home and found that my daughter's chicken on a stick was not in the bag, but something else with crab was in the bag instead, but my daughter doesn't eat that, so I called.  I was asked if it was circled on the menu and it was, but since they mistaken it for something else, they thought we were even.  I had to drive back, return the crab stuff (at their request) and get my daughter's meal.  They did not seem sorry at all and I had cold food to come home to,  I felt like they were calling me a thief, but they are the ones that messed up my order."}
{"text":"Great dive with excellent food. Best Chinese food I've had. Interior is old and grungy, so if you are eating in and want a clean atmosphere, then this isn't the place for you. However, you would be missing out on excellent and cheap food!"}
{"text":"the food, Hunan Beef,  is outstanding and the portions large.  best chinese in the neighborhood.  the decor is showing age including torn carpet and black electrical tape on the booths, some of which have been recovered.  this place is on its way to becoming one of the top Best Dives.  presently, however, it has too much class.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Service not really friendly. Bathrooms were horrid. The stars is based on the overall. I would just order take out from here."}
{"text":"The service was extremely bad to a point we did not want to tip.  Food can out wrong, cold and any sides or sauce requested never came to the table.  My friend actually got up on more than 3 occasions to get them herself.  No apologies or acknowledgement by the waiter.   She very once check up on us let a lone refill our drinks.  I was  really dishearten by this place as for the horrible service and cold food.  A big disappointed.
Definitely not the best Chinese I see some people raving about."}
{"text":"This is our local small Chinese restaurant and we couldn't be happier.  When people come over spur of the moment we often order Amy's and get takeout.  Last week we took the family there with friends and were not disappointed.  Is my wife feeling a little sick... she orders me to Amy's for some soup to go.  We normally go for dinner where the portions are substantial, but we also recently visited for a late late lunch and enjoyed the lunch meals as well.
Thank you Amy!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Chinese restaurant. The next closest is about 7 miles south so we go here when we want some quick Chinese.

The bad: 

egg rolls are frozen crap you get at many Chinese restaurants.

They charge for brown rice

They charge for hot tea if you dine in.

They can't cook spicy no matter how spicy you ask for it. 

Heavy heavy vegetables. This helps make the food look bigger I guess.

The GOOD:

Sweet n Sour pork is excellent 

Egg foo young is great

Teriyaki chicken is great

Bottom line this is a very average Chinese place. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Service is good and very quick.  The owner is always around and smiling.  Teriyaki chicken is fantastic and a large portion and beef brocolli is super tender.  Hot and sour soup is extremely flavorful and a must have to start every meal."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've been able to find in Gilbert... in this price range. It's a classic Chinese restaurant that you would expect, however the food is excellent. The portions are large and take-out is a great option here. Usually plan on 15-30 min for take-out during dinner. Also, my kids love it. 

Recommendations:  Mongolian Beef (my fav), Fried rice, Orange chicken, spring rolls, beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"I eat at Great Wall on a regular basis. The owner is always friendly and the staff makes sure you're taken care of when you dine in.

We usually order take out, which is always ready if you all ahead. Dining in can be hard on a busy night - there usually aren't a lot of open tables.

The food is terrific. I usually order orange chicken. The beef and broccoli and the Kung Pao shrimp and chicken is delicious. 

If you're in the east Valley, it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese takeout place. The spicy eggplant comes with eggplant, onions, garlic, green onions, carrots and bamboo shoots in a tasty spicy sauce. Their dumplings are huge and very tasty."}
{"text":"This a great little mom and pop restaurant.  nothing fancy, but great basic food.  service is great.  I love their egg foo yung!  mongolian beef and kung pow chicken were also flavorful and good.  everything was fresh and served hot.  The egg flower soup was the only thing that was bland."}
{"text":"They have really good orange chicken and their egg drop soup was delicious. The lo mein was also very tasty."}
{"text":"40yrs of chinese food in NY and this is the best tasting ive had in a long time. This place is awesome. Great food but if ur looking for ambiance then this wont work for you."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, the people are nice, but the food is sub sub sub par.  Everything seemed like it had been fried several times. 
The breaded shrimp appetizer...watch out!  3/4 of it in fried bread. The shrimp is somewhere within there. 
Egg rolls...tiny and tough with not much in it.
Soup...wife says it was good, but I used it as dipping sauce for the bread, eh-hem, I mean breaded shrimp
Orange chicken...it's tough to find bad orange chicken, but it was nothing to write about....or is it??? Dang, ya got me.  It's average at best.
Water....very cold!!!
The bill...32.30 for a 20 dollar meal"}
{"text":"Funny story, as you can see, my last name is Lee. We ordered over the phone, told them our name and waited. When we went to pick it up, Amy told us we made a mistake, to which my dad replied that our last name is Lee. She laughed for the longest time, and to this day, calls me and the rest of my family White Lee. Very friendly atmosphere, and kick ass stir fry."}
{"text":"Great food, and BIG portions!! I have tried the sweet and sour chicken, the orange chicken, and the Mongolian beef!! All of it was awesome and I would recommend them all!"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp and Chinese vegetables in  garlic sauce  got Chinese vegetables in garlic sauce no shrimp called them rite away and they said it was what i ordered will never go there again lousy customer service and the food is average at best"}
{"text":"Service has always been excellent. 
Really fast. 
Great Portions. 
One of my absolute favorite Chinese places. 
Amazing Egg Rolls. They are actual Egg Rolls not Spring Rolls. (They have those too) 
Love their Pork Fried Rice! 
Their soups are really good not oily. I'm mildly obsessed with the egg drop and hot and sour. 
One of the great things about take out is that they package everything correctly. No spills 
I only wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend, I must say, I was highly disappointed. I came with my family and we all had the same opinion of the food, which was \"not very good\". Their fried rice was just white rice cooked with soy sauce. Their crispy chicken was not crispy, but soggy. Sesame chicken was soggy as well and both reeked of vinegar, not appetizing. Although just a few dishes tried, I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Try the large Tempura Battered Eggrolls...they are the best egg rolls in town! The prices are low, the portions large,  and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a local business and a local family,  that I just love to support. They are an asset to our community. The food is great, and the service is very friendly. The food is always fresh and hot, whether eating in or carrying out. I have a large family, and they always throw in a free 2liter of soda on my order!  Many people in this small town eat there regularly, and we are fortunate to have them."}
{"text":"Moved here from Chicago 12 years ago and have been craving good Chinese food ever since. I tried several dozen places and was terribly disappointed every time. Then one day I overheard a guy on the bus talking about this place and decide to try it that night for dinner. WOW! I was in heaven Chinese food like I remember, great taste and AWESOME service. The best part? NO VEGGIES IN THE FRIED RICE!!! It is out of my way as I live in the southwest part of town, But I will be eating here A LOT!"}
{"text":"First time tho, traveling from alaska and was fabulous!!! Athough very oldschool but dont let it fool U. Food its beyond AMAIZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Very very good! I don't know why I haven't tried this place before but I am impressed. We got takeout, service was very friendly and quick. I always worry about the chicken being dry but not so. The lo mein was amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. Since they opened in fact. The owners are younger immigrants and don't understand the American hyper-obsession with perfect service because they are from China where what matters in a restaurant is food. As for the food itself it's great for American style Chinese. It is cooked fresh and there aren't additives (e.g. That nasty yellow coloring you'll find in certain nearby places' fried rice). Their prices are also reasonable.

As for the other reviewer, look it's not a chain and the person you spoke to was the owner of the business. But before you bust this restaurant's chops as a new guy in the area consider that she and her husband are paying rent there have plenty of business and if she decided it was too late to explain chinese food concepts to you then it was too late. Before they came that space was vacant, now it is a popular tax paying place. Also try their food before rating a restaurant one star instead of going there to chit chat and expecting amazing results.

If you live in Munroe Falls, go here, support the local business. Nihao!"}
{"text":"I HATE to do this, as we've been here many, many times.  But the past two times we've ordered take out, there has been a little something extra in the meal...Mr. Hair.  It really sucks because the food is good and they have a Weight Watchers menu.  But hair twice in a row...can't go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. Nice family setting, authentic meal, freshly prepared and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a good price.The serving sizes are very generous and will leave you feeling full.Since the serving sizes are very generous you can split a meal and each person will have enough to eat,very nice if you are a family on a budget!.I recommend the Kung-pow chicken,you can never go wrong with the Kung-pow.The inside of the restaurant is kept nice and clean and the staff is friendly.We have been eating here for years and will continue to do so.If you are looking for a nice small Chinese restaurant,then this is the place for you!."}
{"text":"This place is great when your craving for some Chinese food because there's no other place around without having to drive out to Chinatown. The lady at the front is super friendly and nice. They give a good size portion the food is decent. Never ate in because the place makes me sleepy because it's dimly lit. Always ordered take out but usually have to wait when I get there, I think they don't make your order until you're there."}
{"text":"This is a great find, best pork fried rice in the valley.  It's an older place of business, don't be afraid to try this restaurant, as it is a 8 out of 10. Prices are great and serving portions are the real value especially if you like taking your left overs home. Looking forward to returning and trying something different than last time."}
{"text":"Love, Love this resturant!!  Any and her crew are so nice, efficient and friendly. Food is ALWAYS good!  Food served hot and tasty!!  GREat for dine in and take out!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside. My husband and I came for the first time today and we were surprised by how good the service and food was. We got the broccoli chicken and kung pao chicken, which was great. This is a place we will come back to."}
{"text":"The main ingredient is corn syrup. Allow me to explain -- my family and I visited this place about one hour ago. I was pretty excited, because apparently they produce something edible here on occasion, which is good because restaurants usually do that...right? Anyway, I was under the impression that it would be something that resembled New England/New York style Chinese food. Hah, nope. Well, we sat down, and after about 5 minutes or so the waitress passes out our menus. So far, so good. Takes about 10 minutes for her to come back to ask us what we'd like to eat. Also not bad, it's pretty busy for a Monday and we assume she's the only one working the front at this point, so there's no problem. 20 minutes later, after everyone else in the restaurant except us was served (that includes people that arrived well after us, with similarly sized orders, to boot) the waitress hands out the appetizer, chicken wings. They were reportedly quite good, but the complete dearth of drumsticks meant that we weren't exactly getting our money's worth. 20 minutes LATER, the actual food arrives, and by this point I'm wondering what the hell is going on. This is a Chinese restaurant, right? Call this stereotypical, but aren't Chinese restaurants supposed to have eerily quick turnaround times for their food? I thought to myself, \"This is a friggin' paradox, a SLOW Chinese place?\" So while I was happily engaged looking for a rip in the space time continuum (didn't find it, it's probably out back by the dumpster) my rations arrive. I ordered Szechuan Beef, my folks ordered shrimp and lobster sauce, Szechuan chicken, and what appeared to be donut holes with chicken in them. I'm so hungry at this point that the UN is unloading pallets of  emergency food aid into the parking lot, so I dig in expecting -- sugar? I take another bite. The sauce is SATURATED in a thick, syrupy, gloppy mixture of what is probably laundry starch and corn syrup mixed with a dash of soy sauce. It was so sweet it was unreal. Everyone else at the table was complaining about it in short order, and my granddad can't taste the lobster sauce. So looking down at my weirdly meaty dessert , it hits me: Oh yeah, I'm on a diet. So even if I enjoyed drinking straight corn syrup (as opposed to gay corn syrup, which is FABULOUS), this stuff was entirely off limits for me. Now I'm getting a bit pissed, and decide, after a bit of cajoling, to order some teriyaki beef, turning over the possibilities in my mind and wondering, \"How do you mess up beef on a stick?\" WELL BY GOD THEY PERSEVERED, AND LO, I BEHELD BEFORE MY VERY EYES: A candy coated strip of shoe leather. Pretty good for leather, but masquerading as beef is a bit harder. Well played, Great Wall. Oh, yeah, it took them another 20 minutes to get us the check once we were \"done\" (which mostly involved me staring at my plate looking forlorn and slightly constipated), but by that point I just didn't care."}
{"text":"Ugh. I've never ordered from this place before. My father was in the hospital and I wanted to bring him Moo Goo Gai Pan and chicken fried rice, his favorite Chinese food choices. He didn't eat much so I ended up having to eat it. The bok choi is old and discolored. The mushrooms feel like rubber. The steamed rice tastes old. The fried rice has no flavor, barely anything in it (especially chicken), and is drenched in soy sauce and oil.

Yeah, I won't get food from here again."}
{"text":"Nice little home style Chinese Restaurant. Great variety of dishes but they could add some authentic dishes. Great service and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I love Lucy ( the boss, the waitress, the cashier etc.) She is always friendly and treats my whole family good. The food is delish! I live in Summerlin and will drive all the way there for take out. My order is always fresh and correct! Been going here for yrs and will continue to!"}
{"text":"I like their variety appetizers plate and the sweet and sour pork specially for the amount of food you get for the prize, but like any other Chinese place you can taste the grease that's been used over and over again. I loved their crab Ragoon which they didn't over fry as most places do. The service was OK and it wasn't crowded I did see that a lot of the orders are for pick up so maybe that's why you don't see a lot of people inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent average Chinese lunch, typical for AZ"}
{"text":"Subtle flavors, broad menu and great service! Try the sizzling rice soup and the honey walnut shrimp! Amy and her husband have created a special place here!"}
{"text":"Came across this place because it is next door to the Little Caesars that we get our \"Family Movie Night\" pizza from. 

After a little of hesitation we decided to give this place a try. Long story short this place is great, a total diamond in the rough. We eat here at least 1x a week and the food is just like we like it every time..........good quality ingredients and consistent flavors. The portions are large and 2 can easily share 1 meal or pick two to try and then eat the left overs for lunch the next day!

I wouldn't drive a long way to get here but I definitely suggest giving it a try if you are in the area......you can thank me later for the great suggestion! :)"}
{"text":"Love it! Crab puffs yummy, tasty egg drop soup. I have tried a couple of different dishes, all very tasty."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food restaurant! Fast service and good food.  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"If you decide to eat here you MUST get an order of their egg rolls!!  They are HUGE, and one order (you get 2 rolls per order) is enough for 2 people...even 4 people if you cut them in half.  The outside of the roll is crispy and crunchy, the inside is full of hot fresh veggies.  A very satisfying side/snack/meal.  I'm on my way now to pick up my order!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Wanted some authentic Chinese food vs generic Panda Express. Loved it. Everything was very flavorful. I would recommend this place to friends and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Now that I've taken out food from here a few times, I'm downgrading my rating. Yes, they have good-sized Chicken Egg Rolls and excellent hot and sour soup, but the more things you order from here, the more you see they use the SAME brown sauce to make EVERYTHING. Also, their prices are way too high for the small cartons they're putting the food in. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place has to on my top 3 of Chinese spots to eat, if your in the East Valley don't hesitate to try.

I got Shrimp Fried rice, those shrimps are bubba's and very tasty. The Orange Chicken is very good and I don't like a lot of batter so it made it that much more better and crispy.

It's an overall great place, clean restrooms, fast service, very very nice and professional servers. The only thing is that if you get an appetizer, scarf it because your food will follow quickly, ha!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"THE. BEST. LETTUCE WRAPS. IN ARIZONA.

Forget going anywhere else for your Chinese food, especially if you love chicken lettuce wraps, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, etc. They have it all. My (Asian) family moved to this part of town over ten years ago and we have been ordering our take-out from Great Wall exclusively for that entire decade. We've never felt the need to go anywhere else. The interior is a little humble but it's quaint and the staff and owner are so kind and efficient. Food is always served hot and delicious. My parents are a little picky with how their food is made and there has never been any trouble customizing our order. (For example, using thin Singapore noodles for a chow mein dish.) We've ordered takeout here for so long that the owner recognizes our voices on the phone and knows our order by heart! And we have never experienced a bad meal or a poorly-prepared dish. Always delicious! I've started taking my boyfriend here and he's fallen in love with it too. :) Go Great Wall!"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time a few days ago and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I have tried a ton of Chinese food places in the east valley over the last 2 years only to find most are no better than Panda Express and that isn't saying much. 
We ordered the Fried rice, Almond Chicken and Broccoli Beef.
The Fried rice was your basic rice with peas and chicken and was good. The broccoli beef was also good. The Almond chicken was delicious! I had the perfect mixture of flavor. 
We will definitely go back! They were very friendly as well so that was also a plus."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese food place. We even ordered there on Christmas last year.  I went here tonight and waited a good 45 mins for my food. The people in front of me and to the left me got their food before us. We waited :45 mins and my son kept complaining he was hungry. At the :45 min mark I asked to cancel my order so I could feed my son elsewhere. Granted, they were busy but why are the orders being served out of order? When the owner came and asked why we can't wait longer. I said my son was hungry. She said just, \"ok\" no sorry... Nothing. So, we were leaving, a rude lady to the right of me said, \"they didn't wait that long.\" The OWNER replied with, \"oh American restaurant, 2 hour wait, no complaints.\" WOW! You had loyal customers- not anymore!!"}
{"text":"Yummy traditional Chinese food.
If you are looking for someplace fancy, don't come here. Think Hunan Homes in San Fran or most of the SF Chinatown places. This place is just classic. The old lantern lights on the ceiling are cute and I love the horoscope Year of The ____ table paper place mats.
Yes you get packaged fortune cookies with your bill.

Here are a few of our favorite things:
Vegetable moo shu. Wow. Flavor is on point to traditional smokey yummy. Shredded love. They are already rolled up for you. Four large to an order. We love these as an app.

We get the vegetable egg rolls which are actually crispy spring rolls. (Her regular egg rolls have egg wraps and meat inside them.) Crispy and piping hot they will burn your tongue, be careful :)

We usually just stick with water (it's tap) but on the chilly days we get a pot of hot tea. 

Our favs are vegetable fried rice (we request no egg). Heavy handed on the soy sauce this wok fried favorite is packed with baby corn, broccoli, snap peas, carrots, sprouts, and they are all hand cut and fresh. No soggy veggies here. The portions are large and cooked steaming hot to order.

Vegetable chow mein is my husbands favorite, he requests no bok choy because he doesn't care for it. Once again packed with vegetables and piled high on the plate.

Garlic fried rice (hold the egg) this item that we order is not on the menu. It is super duper yummy and loaded with garlic and flavor.

Singapore style spicy noodles. I have been craving this ever since I had it at Veggie Delite (theirs is too greasy) and I was excited to know that she could make it with vegetables only. It's spicy but not even a medium spicy to me. That's ok because it's packed full of flavor and piled high with vegetables. 

One time we ordered a lightly spicy gravy sauce item called Ma Po Tofu and it was good. That comes with plain steamed rice on the side. This item is super saucy. Not sure if she has brown rice but prob not. 

Lucy knows what we like and even remembers no egg no meat no bok choy on the items that we order. She calls us sweetie, honey and darling :) she is a real gem!"}
{"text":"gotta love the BBQ pork fried rice, Lucy is super friendly and the food tastes great and at great prices, love it here"}
{"text":"I stopped here with my baby who adores Chinese food and my hubby. The prices were amazing and the staff was super friendly!! The food was fast Chinese but way better than Panda Express and cheaper plus family owned. I love that! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. Big portions, great taste, and best of all the service was superb! First time here, but I'll be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!!!! It's a  small a hole in the wall place, gotta love it!!!  delicious soup,  super crispy sweet and sour chicken.  the lady is always nice and very attentive. Quick service great for lunch time. We would totally come back many more times."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate some food from here for take-out, we werent impressed.  OK, but I wouldn't order from here again. I'm not sure why it got such high reviews, we just moved here and this is the first Chinese place we've been to so maybe this is good for the area, I don't know. The entrees were reasonably priced, but the appetizers were overpriced.  $5-6 for crab puffs is way too much. My biggest complaint about the food is that in the Kung Pao Chicken we ordered the chicken wasn't the breaded and fried variety typical of american style Chinese food, and sauce wasn't very flavorful.  Maybe they are trying to be more authentic with the chicken, but the rest of the dish was your typical americanized Chinese, so there was a mismatch there."}
{"text":"Very very Disappointed. 

The food isn't what it appears to be at all. It LOOKS LIKE big portions. THEY AREN'T. 
Unless you like just coating of your food and just the wonton skins in your dumpling soup.

  The wonton dumplings in the wor wonton soup is literally just a balled up wonton, wrapped in a wonton. Not a veggie and or meat stuffing wrapped in wonton, but A balled up, empty wonton, inside another wonton wrapper.

Im uploading a photo of the sweet and sour shrimp with pineapple and peppers.  The breading to Shrimp ratio is so ridiculous its laughable.  I'm pretty sure the first few pieces eaten were JUST breading.   Shrimp Not even half the size of my pinky finger, and I'm a small person.  

I'm nearly offended rather than just appalled at the price to food ratio at this place.  20 bucks for the 2 items and they were \"fake\" in a way. 

Un stuffed wonton dumplings. 
And the tiniest shrimps in batter that makes them look 7 times their size. Unnecessary Scaming BS.

You're ripping people off and you know it.
Abserd. Don't waste your time here there's way to many places to eat in this city for this kind of RiffRaff."}
{"text":"I come here quite often as it's the only Chinese place near my house. The food is really good. I enjoy the food and the soups. The lunch menu is pretty affordable, and you get a lot of food for the amount you pay. I do think the dinner prices and other items are too expensive,as you pretty much get the same amount of food as the lunch but they charge a lot more."}
{"text":"The place looks a little divy when you pull up,  but that's pretty typical for a chinese restaurant.  I called and ordered dinner for my parents and me. They said it woild be ready in 10 minutes.  When I got  there it was ready as promised.  When I got home the food was very hot and could tell everything was freshly made. Crab Rangoons were delicious (think they called them crab or cheese puffs). I had the Crispy Chicken and my parents had sweet and sour chicken. We all were pleased! The portions are huge and we all had enough left over to each have another meal. Glad to have found a good Chinese place in Gilbert as I have just moved here and seem to only find Panda Express which I think is gross."}
{"text":"We got Pork Lo Mein, Chicken Lo Mein and Mongolion Beef. My Husband loved his Mongolian Beef (i have had better). My pork Lo mein was disgusting! My dad had the Chicken Lo Mein and he said it was good. The best part about the meal was the rice. That was actually good! But it came in a very small container. I will not go back here again. For $27 I can find better Chinese."}
{"text":"This was a lovely surprise. We had ordered take out from here shortly after moving to the area in 2014. I got a basic vegetable dish, which I didn't care for at all so we never went back. Discovered today that we judged too soon, I merely ordered wrong and had chosen the most basic dish on the menu. Today we visited in-person and ate in, and it was awesome. Food was hot, fresh, obviously made to order. Apps were delish, we got fried wonton, spring rolls and French fries, which were a hit with the 10 yr old at the table. We ordered pan fried chicken and vegetables (cooked tender crisp, perfect), orange chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice and a kids plate with teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was excellent and flavorful, and portions were huge. We fed five diners for $85 including tip, service was fast and great, and we have lunches left over for tomorrow. Win! 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I will not come back to this restaurant anymore. The egg rolls were tasteless, the house fried rice has egg shells in it, the Mongolian beef was a smaller portion, but the same price and no fortune cookies included, third time in a row.  How do you not have fortune cookies at a Chinese food restaurant!  Stupid !"}
{"text":"Located in a very unassuming, old school commercial strip mall off of Charleston.   My partner having previous knowledge of GWCR, brought me her for a quick lunch-to-go.  At first I did not think I was going to order anything, but the lunch specials are super cheap!  My partner picked up the tab, and for the both of us, lunch was just a little under $13 bucks.  This is cool...bit after a short hop back to the office, I was solid at the quality of lunch.  It traveled well and the ingredients were fresh.

Unassuming.....I thought of this over and over.  I wanted to eat at the restaurant.  It sort of encapsulated the Chinese restaurants of my youth.  The lighting, the decorating, the happy, happy.

I would return with others for a lunch meeting a few weeks.  No complimentary hot tea or little crunchy sticks, but no matter.  The service was friendly.  The food was quick and tasty.

Thank you Nelita U!"}
{"text":"this place was clean and great service to boot! The food was fresh and came to our table quickly. The menu was extensive and the prices were very good. We had the garlic chicken and spring rolls the veggie style. Nothing was greasy or overly cooked. the veggies with the garlic chicken had just the right amount of crispness to them still and the sauce was perfect! We would eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Debating where to eat dinner that night, my family came upon this Chinese restaurant. At first I thought it was a pizza place because their advertisement deals outside the windows didn't apply to other chinese restaurants I've been to, until I looked above and it said 'Great Wall'.

When I first walked in I just saw one customer. But as we got our orders and time passed by more people came in. Which I was surprised, as well as their food, it was pretty good!

Our waitress was really nice. She served us Wonton Chips with the red sauce to munch on while we wait for our food.
We ordered fried rice and orange beef but the ones I had scooping for more were these two:

- Fried Calamari: It had a salty flavor which was delish!

- Singapore Fried Rice Noodles: A lil kick of heat, wow really good!

I do want to come back and order those two as take out next time."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sinful pleasure for those nights when we don't want to cook.  Heck, if we're ill, we ALWAYS come here for the soups... if s friend or family member is ill?  Soup is on the way!  Egg drop and Won Ton are favs.  We love them all.  Back to the sinful pleasure part.  Mom would be so ashamed!  Our favorite order usually goes something like Sesame Beef, Cashew Chicken, Lemon Chicken, and Crab /Cream Cheese Rangoons.  Oh, and fried rice for everything.  You aren't alone if you're thinking, \"What? No veggies?\" That's usually what the lovely gal at Great Wall asks before we ask for extra duck sauce.  We are adult enough (sometimes) to admit our failings.  Sesame Beef is a big one!  It is amazing!  Who would think that a sweet lemon sauce would go with Beef, but oh boy!  It really does.  I'm sure they make fine veggies, but that isn't why we order there!  We have eaten there, and it's also nice, but we generally pick up and take home.  Oh, and please remember the soups for cases of illness or (have I no shame?) colonoscopies.  (Strain the goodies, drink the broth only.)  Great Wall is tasty and amazingly fast.  Orders are ready before we can get to their storefront near our favorite Walgreens at Higley and Williams Field.  Order veggies if you must, but order from Great Wall."}
{"text":"Since moving to the East Valley almost a year and a half ago, we were baffled by the fact that we had not been able to find a decent Chinese take-out joint. One place we tried was almost inedible, and the others were places that we would not visit a second time.

Then we found this place. It was like finding a long-lost cousin. The food was very good. The prices were what you would expect. And the atmosphere was busy but very nice and comfortable.

The wife prominently declared this as \"Our Chinese Place.\" I seconded the motion and look forward to visiting \"our Chinese place\" quite often."}
{"text":"Go here! Do not waste your time with any other Chinese place.  The food is fantastic, it is cheap, portions are generous.  We had Kung pao Chicken, hot and sour soup! A+.  This place is great solo or with family!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and wanted to eat some Chinese food. So we looked this place up because it was in the area that we were in. All can say is very good food and the prices are excellent. So much food I had to take the rest back to the hotel we are staying in. Well I guess dinner for the next day. Yummie"}
{"text":"Great food, unlike most Chinese around Arizona.

They also serve Crab rangoon, not cream cheese puffs."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. I show up, and the chef and two other employees are in the dining room eating. There was nobody in the kitchen. They wait until after I pay, and the chef goes back and makes my food. Eventually the woman that checked me out brings out my food, and the chef follows to eat his food. Why in the hell did I order to go if they wait until you get there to even start making your food? Garbage."}
{"text":"Very good food but the service is slow whether you call ahead or eat in the restaurant. I called at 7 PM for pick up they told me 25 minutes. I got there at 7:35 food was still not ready finally 750 food is ready. That is just too long to wait thank you. But the food is delicious"}
{"text":"I've been going there a while now with no issues, great food and service until yesterday-I ordered $55 worth of food, General Tso chicken, orange chicken, shrimp egg foo young, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls etc..

I got there early, a few minutes before they opened and they were kind enough to let me in to order for a Playoff party however, the chicken both Tso & Orange tasted old, recooked, dried out and the worse thing is many of us ended up with very bad diarrhea.

I'm so disappointed because every time I go there I always spend $40 and up and to have people getting sick (including me) was so embarrassing and to waste my money by having to throw food out was hard because all my pennies count. 

Whoever cooked yesterday 16 January 2016 at noon should be ashamed for serving tainted food.

You have let a good paying/tipping customer down on what should have been a great NFL Playoff party. :("}
{"text":"Food is really good Chinese here in vegas!  The service is good and attentive. Does quite a bit of return customers which know the owner by name during our visits. Only thing to beware of is the size of the portions....LOTS OF FOOD for a reasonable price. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Chinese restaurant. The portions are large and very good value for the money. The inside is dated, but it is over shadowed by the warm greeting and the excellent service. Overlook the interior and enjoy great food and genuine hospitality. This is our new local's spot for chinese take out."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here. I have only ordered the sweet & sour chicken, spring rolls, and fried rice. (To Go service) 
Pros is the sauce is given to you on the side so you may add as little or as much as you please (: This is also great because the chicken stays good for leftovers the next day. The chicken dinner comes out to around 10$, which is a fair price for the amnt of chicken you are getting.

Staff is very friendly and efficient. Plus the food doesnt take long. I usually get 10-15 minute timeframe for pickup. which is nice, i only live 5 minute away so i dont have to instantly run out the door.

The inside does need a small overhaul. I come from LA city so i like the 'mum-and-pop' feel, but many of the booths are torn and have masking or ducttape covering the holes ): theres some interesting decor choices, but nothing offensive. Its not a PF Changs chain so you should not expect granite tabletops and stone statues, but the food is more important than decor anyways!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty much Panda Express. American chinese food, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I like this place. Went with hubby and three hungry teenagers, I ordered two bowls of sizzling rice soup. It was delicious and portions were large. We ended up bringing half of it home. We ordered 5 entrees and 4 egg rolls.  The portions are very large & we have a lot of leftovers.Place was hoping on a Sunday night.We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time tonight. Had chicken with cashews, dumplings and fried wontons. All of the dishes were good. The portions were very large. The service was excellent. Have finally found a good Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not horrible but not good either. Ringing endorsement, right? No delivery but worth an occasional carry-out. we often order the crab puffs, which are pretty good. No big chunks of onion and peppers and a good balance of sweetness and salt with crab, cream cheese, a touch of scallion and sugar. The s&s sauce that comes with is pretty good as well.  

We have tried wonton and egg drop soups (flavors are missing and the egg drop soup is so thick it takes on a snot-like consistency. Yes, I went there. :-) 

We also have tried:  
-s&s pork (all overcooked breading and no meat), 
-teriyaki chicken kabobs(chewy, weird texture), 
-general tso's chicken(awesome sauce and lots of broccoli. again, chewy strange chicken meat), 
-pan fried noodles(good texture but bland sauce), 
-all varieties of fried rice(good taste but wish the rice were a bit more sticky)
-honey walnut shrimp (great taste...again wish it were a touch more sticky instead of runny)
-chicken chow fun (noodles were cooked really well, but WAY too many overcooked bean sprouts. Some of the chicken was good but others had that weird, chewy fake taste again).

We definitely go here due to lacking variety with Chinese cuisine in our area. After trying so many dishes and never being extreme impressed, not quite convinced that we will be back...at least not for a long time."}
{"text":"We have looked for a good Chinese restaurant since we moved here 4 years ago.  Finally we found this place.  We have been 3 times in 2 months and have ate there every time.  The place is was busy each time and there was always a line of at least 5 deep for take out.  The spring rolls are great to start, we have ordered the pork fried rice and the chicken fried rice and loved the chicken.  My husband always orders the Mongolian beef (he is very picky) and it have been cooked and seasoned perfect every time.  The chicken low mein was just warm temp when delivered, but when I asked them to make it hot it came out really yummy.  Our teenagers really liked the orange chicken -not too breaded or saucy.  The broccoli chicken also has great flavor. You will not be disappointed. It is clean, friendly and I found to be fast even when we arrived and had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here!! Yes it's still the same quaint older restaurant I remember. I would always come with my Grandma who is Chinese, she knew her stuff  They have the best lunch specials - you always get a lot for what you pay for. And I personally have always loved the wonton soup and the ginormous egg rolls!! Yumm.  Go visit!"}
{"text":"I'd thought about taking out from this place for a couple years. 1st of all, hard to find/notice. It's not facing the main street because of the strip mall/parking lot situation. What a shame because this is someplace people should notice & discover. I called in an order, she said 30 minutes. I got there exactly 30 minutes after ordering, had to wait 10 more minutes but it was well worth it! They're closed Sundays. I ordered their chicken chow fun entree (asked for very little vegetables), it was outstanding. It was not too salty and had no MSG after taste at all. It's made to order, came out piping hot, filled the container. Their portions are hearty and you get what you pay for. The woman who runs the counter is very attentive and welcoming. I'm happy to support this mom & pop place."}
{"text":"We have visited many times and the service has always been great. The Kung Poa chicken is great. We keep trying new items and they are always very good."}
{"text":"Bad.  No flavor.  Order spicy, no flavor what so every.  Won't be back.  They were too busy arguing with another customer to wait on me.  Called order in for takeout, but gave no sauce, napkins or cookies in bag."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place is in my neighborhood!  My husband and I get take out from here a couple of times a month and it's consistently delicious each time.  AND, the staff is super friendly, which I'm a huge fan of.

We always get their dinners that come with soup, rice, spring roll and entree.  If you ask nicely, they will substitute a spring roll for the soup.  It makes me happy :)"}
{"text":"Classic Chinese fare served hot and fast! 

Me and my date went in and started with the sizzling rice soup and it was delicious. My date seemed to think the chicken was thin, but that was made up for with huge shrimp! Our appetizer was pot stickers and they were huge and tasty! Definitely recommend.

For dinner I had the sweet and sour pork. I dislike mine small and crispy, I rather like them big and puffy, but the taste was good. Just a little crispy for my likes. There were plenty of veggies and pineapple, though. Really good. 

My date had the szechaun spiced chicken which was okay, but I don't really like my Chinese food spicy so I passed on that. 

We ordered some shrimp fried rice as well and it was a HUGE portion. You definitely get what you pay for here and it's all really good. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"If you are broke but still need to take someone out to dinner, Great Wall might be the just the place to get away with it. It's definitely a hole in the wall, but that just makes it intimate! Portions are so gigantic that you could probably split an order... and I don't think there's a single item on the menu over $10, and that's for dinner prices!

Menu has plenty to choose from, and some standouts for me include the won ton soup, the Great Wall egg foo yung (shrimp and bbq pork), and the double mushroom beef. My guy and I argue over whether the gigantic eggrolls are any good (he says yes, I say no), but we are united in disliking the lemon chicken dish here- the only thing we won't order again (breading is way too thick)."}
{"text":"This place is great! This is my go to Chinese place in Higley. They are fast. The quality is great, the service is fast, and its tasty!  

Their pot stickers are awesome. Their soups are all good as well. Great to get your fix here. I have always ordered take out but their inside is clean and well kept. Looks like they have some good bar options if that's your thing. Their shrimp is good and fresh as well."}
{"text":"Good portion flavorful food best in Gilbert so far. Their hot and sour soup is to die for, my kids love their Orange chicken it's actually real chicken not just skin and batter with sauce. Every bite is real chicken. It may be a little more price wise as compared to other mom and pop Chinese placed but it's worth it because they put a lot of meat. Never try to cut corners whatsoever. Their vegetable Kung pao is a great option for vegetarians"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The food is great and the price is so inexpensive!  The lady who works there is so seeet!  It's my favorite Chinese restaurant now."}
{"text":"Been going to the Great Wall for about 45 years. Parents and grandparents used to take me there as a kid. Food is amazing and they will make things special if needed.  A must visit if u haven't been already.  Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Ordered their Peking duck . This is one of their  signature  dishes.  Nice crunchy  crispy  skin on a warm bun with onions. Had their  roast pork . The skin was also nice and crunchy.not much fat . Had their  crab with ginger sauce . The crab was small but flavorful"}
{"text":"Good prices, decent food. While the employees were kind, their service wasn't all that sharp. We never even got napkins.
The crab puffs were quite good though."}
{"text":"With only a 30 min lunch window, I have to make use of the time I have.  Great Wall is fast and efficient.  

First time, I had to come in.  I didn't have a menu or phone number.  I made a quick lunch order.  Great pricing and a big selection.  There really wasn't a wait.  Took me 10 minutes.  Service is quick and while waiting, I noticed other folks calling in orders.  Which I took to grab a menu to stash at work for next time.  Place was packed while I was there.  

I ordered a sweet and sour pork, and chow mein lunch special.  My chow mein was huge, way too much for lunch.  Came with an eggroll and some fried rice.  My coworker ate his whole box up.  I asked him how was it, and he goes \"that hit the spot.\"  He's down to grab another box again next time.  The chow mein was decently made.  Not too heavy on the flavor which is great.  I don't like how some places make it like Panda Express with tons of oil/grease.  

They knew how to package the togo boxes.  Added utensils and sauces/spices.  Parking may be a pain during rush hour.  I browsed their menu and say mushu pork..  Not too many places make this item, so I'll def have to head back to grab me one."}
{"text":"They billed tips automatically?and I just got my bill without any details .They charged me double tips."}
{"text":"Straightforward Chinese food. Not a fancy place but good food and a great price. I ate the pork chop suey lunch special. It comes with rice and a spring roll. Was a large portion and filled me up so much so that I didn't opt for the egg flour soup afterwards which I planned to order ; but I was too full. 
The pace was very busy during lunch time. Lots of people coming and going with take out orders. And a lot of local people on their lunch break. All in all I would defiantly recommend giving this place a try.
I heard one lady say hat she has been coming here for 30 years since they opened. 
This is a locals place for a good reason. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food for your money. Food is really good I love how they use all white meat for there dishes not like some Chinese places use all breaded, definitely worth a try it's really good"}
{"text":"Good food. I like the vegetable delight here. There are several others that I like. I visit this place a few times every year."}
{"text":"Wonderful food for an amazing price. The chicken Moo Goo Hai Pan was delicious, the chicken with cashew nuts was awesome, and their fried shrimp is the best. The lunch special is an unbeatable deal. You get a lot of food for a really good price.
The atmosphere is a little dark & slightly dingy but it is cozy & worth it... definitely classic Vegas."}
{"text":"The pork fried rice is amazing has a lot of flavor and the crab puffs are pretty good also!  it's been a while since I had good Chinese food and think I found a new place to eat"}
{"text":"I have ordered take out several times & it's always fast & correct.  The food is exactly what you would expect from a chinese restaurant. 

I like that they have a nice selection of vegetarian options. The sesame tofu is excellent. My husband is not a vegetarian & he loves it."}
{"text":"I have been having lunch or dinner there more than one hundred times during my two-year study around  Las Vegas . In general, the restaurant is awesome. A lot of good dishes to choose. The service is nice and efficient."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Old school Chinese food like when i was a kid. Im glad i ignored the lowered star reviews for silly things. We got a happy platter and it was so cool! Both of our entrees were delicious. The service was so friendly and she kept our drinks full. The place is clean. Cant ask for more."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and prompt. Portions ample and quality good.y husband asked for extra spicy and it was still a but mild. My Szechuan chicken had a good kick. Lots of fresh veggies in both dishes. Taste was good but nothing I would crave. We brought home lots of leftovers."}
{"text":"By far my favorite type of food is Chinese food and Great Wall Chinese Restaurant is a really good hole in the Great Wall establishment to visit. The place itself is not much to marvel at from the outside but when you enter its almost like you have transported yourself to Hong Kong. The décor is seedy, the lights are dim and the music is traditional. At the counter is an old Chinese lady that seems like she could be Jackie Chan's grandmother. As you look past the tables and booths you can picture a group of Triads having lunch and discussing who they are going to bump off next. The food is excellent, very traditional flavors and their portions can serve about 3-4 people. They have a good lunch menu as well that is not more than 44.73 Chinese Yuan which is equal to about 7 US dollars. I fancy good Chinese food and have different places that I like to eat at and this is in my top 5 choices. Xièxiè!"}
{"text":"some of the best Chinese food I've tasted since I've moved here,  chow mien is flavorful and reminds me of lo mien from New York, i have to keep reminding myself to get something new when i go there but there chow mien is just amazing"}
{"text":"3.5 if I could. Good quality food from this Chinese kitchen with a large and ready to understand menu. Restaurant has very little seating and is geared toward takeout and delivery. Watch the chefs prepare your meal while you wait..."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying this place isn't cheap on the portions! Got food for pick up and food was ready in 20 minutes. Peppered chicken here is awesome as well as the fried rice. Chicken egg rolls are massive and also very good. Pricing is a little steep for Chinese takeout but the portions of food they give makes up for the high prices. Overall very good Chinese takeout and would go back."}
{"text":"This place is a definite diamond in the rough. Cozy, classic decor and atmosphere.
The food was delicious, the portions were huge and our server was a very sweet lady. I will definitely go out of my way to eat here often. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was great! My husband is such a picky eater and he really enjoyed it. We will definitely be making this restaurant part of our dine out rotation."}
{"text":"We order Orange Chicken all the time.  Great take-out (never actually eat in), but seems legit on the inside.

The kids scream for it when they are at G-ma's house and she gets the orange chickem broccoli and beef and Kung Pao chicken... all awesome.  Love the egg rolls too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fair prices, and can get your order up and out pretty fast. One of my favorite places for Chinese!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but it was just 'off' . . .Ordered a chicken dish I've had for years at other places, and the chicken was moist, but in an off-putting way. Almost like it was boiled until about 30 seconds before it would be totally cooked, and then mixed into the sauce. It didn't blend well with the other flavors, and stood out with it's own flavor and texture. It wasn't bad, but I had zero interest in wanting to take a 2nd bite.

Alternatively the egg drop soup was tasty."}
{"text":"The spicy Mongolian beef is amazing! I get it almost every time I come here! My work office is very close by so this is a to go when ever we forget to bring our lunch!"}
{"text":"Food here was great! I came here with my family and the waiter was really nice. Combination rice was delicious, also the won ton soup. My family and I will be going back to eat here."}
{"text":"Try the Mongolian chicken. It's spicy and a tinge weet. The owner is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Love the food and it is right up the road from me! (The best kind of deal :-) ) The owner is so sweet and I love going there!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise!! The food was delicious, fresh, and customer service was great. The potstickers were delicious and had a crispy texture in one side but they were moist inside. I am definitely stopping in if I'm in the area again. I had the Hong Kong style noodles and it was a very large portion with an egg roll. The noodles were soft on the bottom and crunchy on the sides which gave the dish its unique flavor. My kids enjoyed their dishes of beef and broccoli and Kung pao chicken with shrimp. The Kung pao had a kick to it of course. The other dish we ordered was the black pepper chicken which was spicy but oh so good. Overall a great experience to be had . We had a enjoyable lunch in which the place wasn't overcrowded and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"My neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Food is delicious and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I called the order in and still had to wait another 30 minutes when I arrive when they said it would be ready. Food wasn't worth the crappy service. Never again."}
{"text":"great wall has some of the best chineese in Arizona.  Since Big Wongs closed in down town Phoenix i have always searched for the best Walnut Shrimp and I think I have found it.  Amazing as well as all their rice and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is always great and the customer service is always on point..."}
{"text":"I came here 2 years ago and it was good. I spoke to the owner in Cantonese and she was very delightful.
We ordered the pork fried rice and the house soup. The soup was a clear chicken broth, included lots of veggies and bbq pork. It reminded me of my mom's soup."}
{"text":"I was hungry for Chinese food, and Great Wall is right up the street from my house, so I tried it...

I had the Mongolian Shrimp and Chicken, and it was  just above average in flavor. I got my order to go, and the food was served lightening fast.

The joint is clean, the staff was helpful, but not the friendliest, and you get a lot of food for the money. It was decent, I'll be back."}
{"text":"They have dine in and take out. We dined in and ordered the lunch special. Under $8 and you get fried rice, spring roll, fortune cookie and your main choice. I got the kung pao chicken. Very juicy chicken with tons of veggies. Great flavor, could use a little more spice. Big servings for lunch time. Will love to try other things on the menu. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Come for the great and cheap lunch menu they have,great tasting food ,Super friendly vibe and great amount of food for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Use  to come here all the time and very disappointed by tonight service and food. Ordered combination chow mein got home and noticed crispy noddles missing from our order. Went back and told them  the noddles were missing and said they were in the bag. Instead of just giving me the crispy noddles she disagreed with me. She must of been too busy so she took the food back and handed me $10 from the cash drawer. Sorry we will not be back."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for Chinese takeout (it's the main thing that makes my daughter homesick).  Some co workers ordered takeout  from here a few weeks ago,and sparked my interest.  Of course, I had to check out some Yelp reviews,  and my mission was set.  I decided to venture out tofind this hidden gem and surprise my daughter. I'm so glad I did.  The food is delicious! 

The location  is right on Charleston in a strip mall near the Medical District . The exterior has a huge mural of a brick wall.  Drive slowly so you can turn before you get to the corner,  or you will have to double back (I learned the hard way). 

The interior is clean,intimate and quiet. Its  not  a fancy, formal  place, but it is comfortable. The staff was very friendly and patient.  They answered questions about various dishes and explained portion sizes. I felt very comfortable and welcomed.  Service was really quick! There we're several tables dinning in and one person ahead of me who ordered takeout,  yet my order  was ready in about 10 minutes. 

I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken which came with steamed rice ($8.10) and 2 orders of the Spring Egg Rolls ( 2 for $4.10). The portions are huge.  The Egg Rolls, which we loved could easily  be cut in half and shared . The chicken was also family sized.  I'm  thinking the Combination Plate  might be better if your  not sharing with anyone or if your not into leftovers. 

My daughter loved the Sweet and Sour Chicken! I wish this location we're closer to my home, but I will  gladly venture back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this hole in the wall while driving, absolutely some of the best Chinese Food my family and I have ever had and we live in the SF Bay Area. Quick, friendly service just before they closed."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this place except last visit which is hardly worth mentioning but we ordered veggie lo mein minus mushrooms due to a food allergy and they forgot to leave out the mushrooms. Other than that this place is usually spot on and tasty!

I've found only one other place I like pepper steak from (Hung Fai on Fleet Ave) so I was extremely pleased how delightful they're pepper steak dinner is! Veggie lo mein is good, General tso is good, rice is good, egg rolls are good. One menu item I'm definitely not a fan of is their won ton soup..its bland. 

Prices are comparable to other Chinese restaurants, around $7 for a combo. The staff is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Still good, but stick with the chicken entrees. Tried the salt-and-pepper squid, and it had WAY too much breading. Saigon Pho does the dish much better."}
{"text":"I have never ordered orange chicken before.   I mistakenly thought it was a spicy savory dish.    I didn't particularly care for the meal as I don't enjoy sweet chicken. But that is not to say the dish was bad, just not was I anticipated.    The chicken was quite tender, and I appreciate that they only just white meat.    The service was good and the portions are large.    I would be willing to try this place again.   Maybe next time I will try the lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Food is crazy amazing good. Chicken and vegetables, or the spicy version hun an chicken are awesome. Mongolian beef is great, moo shu pork wraps are really good. All appetizers are great. Friendly and nice people. Great prices. Take out is quick, dine in is great too."}
{"text":"Based on the good Yelp reviews, my family and I decided to give the restaurant a try for dinner.  Quite frankly, the restaurant near Rancho and Charleston fits the description of a classic \"hole in the wall\".  

Upon looking at the menu, we were pleasantly surprised at the pricing of dinner entrees ranging from $6.75 to $9.75.  After digging into the plates of food (generous portions!), wow...the food was really awesome!

The Egg Drop soup was tasty, Great Wall combo fried rice was delicious, the Mongolian beef was outstanding, and the beef chow fun was killer!  The only item that was good--but not great--was the Kung Pao chicken...it seemed kinda sweet and lacked the spicy red chili peppers.

We will definitely be going back again!  I'd like to next try out the Egg Foo Young...I just have a feeling that it will be delicious like the other dinner entrees!  I highly recommend the restaurant for the great service, cheap prices and yummy food...just don't expect too much in terms of aesthetics."}
{"text":"Take out review-
The good: very generous portions. We ordered 4 dishes. Each could easily have fed 3 people. Leftovers galore!
The meh: food is pretty standard Chinese fare. Not great, not bad but just what you'd expect.
The bad: do NOT expect timely service. I called to place the order at 6:00. Was told 20 minutes. Arrived at 6:20. The cashier/waitress/ owner searched for our order-receipt and I paid for it. She then handed it to the cook, who proceeded to prepare our food. 18 minutes later I was walking out of the restaurant. I know this because my wife and dog were waiting in the car with the engine running. Thankfully, she turned the engine off at some point so we would have enough gas to make it home.
We had a similar experience last year...probably won't be back until 2019"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food! We ordered the pork fried rice, garlic beef and orange chicken and it was all delicious! We will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was great! Even though there was only one server, she was very sweet and did everything possible to make us happy. The food was very authentic and delicious, I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"My parents kept ranting a raving about this place and I finally tried it. It's a \"hole in the wall\" kind of a place, but extremely good. All of their soups and main courses I've eaten have been great. What is a huge plus is that I never feel like I just ate a container of salt after leaving, it's not too seasoned like other places. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! If you're looking for a great place to eat Chinese this is it! We usually order this for pickup and bring it home after a long work week - it definitely beats fast food or pizza any night."}
{"text":"I will say the food is tasty, which is the reason for 2 stars. But the wait is ridiculous. I have been here 2 separate times, the first time we waited for 20 minutes for 2 lunch specials. Now the second time I am here, well over 15 minutes to pour (pre-made) soup in a bowl. And then I had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for a box and my check. I understand it was prime lunch hour, but I still found the wait to be excessive for what I ordered. Very annoying and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on two occasions so far with a friend during lunch time. We're both budget tight medical students so this seemed like a great place to eat.

The first time we came, I had ordered the kung pao chicken lunch special and my friend ordered the cashew chicken lunch special. I honestly didn't really like the kung pao chicken because it wasn't spicy at all. However, the cashew chicken dish was great! The second time we came in, I ordered the chicken chow mein lunch special and my buddy ordered the same cashew chicken dish. This time, the chow mein was great and was really flavorful! So after the second time, I was able to respect this place a bit more.

Service wasn't that bad. The waitress came by frequently to check on us despite the growing number of people starting to show up for lunch. 

I honestly think the food is great for the price and they don't try to rip you off with the portion size. I left stuffed both times! Also this place is close to many clinics, UMC and Valley Hospital, so it makes it really easy to grab a quick lunch. 

I will be back!!"}
{"text":"First try, based on yelp reviews.  It was delicious. Exceeded my expectations. I absolutely love hot and sour soup and had place in queen creek I used to go to several years ago when we were first married that had amazing hot and sour soup. We went again recently and it was not as good as it used to be. Glad to find a place that I can enjoy. The pork lo me in was also very good and really good portions!  The orange chicken was average but the fried rice with it was just the right level of moist and flavorful. All around it was a wonderful place to eat and worth the cost. All sad part was my fortune cookie was empty!  Ha ha, definitely not the restaurants fault though."}
{"text":"I got take out here for the first time tonight to fulfill a chinese pregnancy craving I had. Their menu was diverse and had items like Honey Walnut Shrimp that take the menu a step up. The prices seemed reasonable, but when I saw my portion I realized the prices are amazing! I ordered the Great Wall Special Chicken and some spring rolls. When I picked up my take out I was surprised at how heavy that one order was. The entire take out box was FULL of chicken! Very tasty, and definitely satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the East valley... that I've found so far.  This is now a regular take-out place for me and the girl"}
{"text":"My new spot for Chinese take out and the food is good but a bit more expensive than what I was paying on the Westside for the same meals.  I've been here twice and the various chicken and beef plates we shared were spot on.  The chow mein noodles however were too greasy and short.  Chicken egg roll is the only app I've tried and it was substantial and perfectly crispy... the best egg roll I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The Good- Service was very friendly and the food came out super fast. The food was good, but not great. Mongolian Beef was good and the amount of food for the money was pretty good. I could easily split one dish with someone and be full. If the service had been lousy, I would have only given this place 2 stars.

The Bad- Some of the food was too oily. It tasted like they either used too much oil or they used old dirty oil... or both. Also, they don't deliver. In my opinion, every chinese restaurant like this should deliver. There is almost nothing better than chinese delivery.

The Ugly- the decor is dreadful! I'm a fan of hole-in-the-wall/ dive type restaurants, but this one? not so much. It's decorated like a back woods, country diner or something. There are ugly fake flowers placed in weird spots, country type art on the walls and duct tape on some of the booths. The rooster themed curtain on the door seriously made me almost turn around and leave without even trying it. 

I will maybe give this place another shot, but only for take-out, unless they change the decor. or if they ever offer delivery, but... i found another chinese restaurant that delivers nearby and they were great, so...."}
{"text":"Surprisingly pretty good takeout Chinese.  I'm usually left unimpressed with local Mom and Pop Chinese food.  Something is always lacking and the flavor lacks depth and dimension.  However I was quite impressed with the meals we ordered.  An employee working there made recommendations for me and even brought me a few things to try, he was excellent!  The order was completed quickly, I waited about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because it's close to my job.  The lady that works in the front is really nice but the food is just alright.  I've never had a major complaint but today my food was not good.  I ordered shrimp fried rice for lunch and it's different, maybe a new cook or they change the oil.  It smells really good but has no taste whatsover.  Even after adding soy sauce and pepper it's unedible.  I'm so surprised because I love fried rice and who can mess that up.  Now I have to find something else to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"The portions are great. Always have leftovers! I think that it is one of the best chinese restaurants i've been to in AZ. Definitely better than pei-way. If you are in the area. Do it."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and was very surprised that everything was very good.The Egg Drop soup and fried rice was done right. Finally we found a good Chinese Restaurant. We will return."}
{"text":"Took me by surprise king pao chicken, sweet sour soup, and the Mongolian beef were absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"This is probably some of the worst service I've ever had in my life. 5+ minutes to be acknowledged while standing at the door (good thing we weren't in a rush), told to sit at a dirty table (there were multiple of them by the way- they didn't bother to clean the carpet near the next table where they still had a high chair and didn't move it until another party came in and complained). Once we were sitting, another 10 + minutes to get our waters which came far after the server said anything to us. Honestly, this place needs to get it together. 

The food itself i good, and the lunch portion was perfect. I also really enjoyed the wonton soup.  Good thing I didn't need anything cause they didn't check in with us at all. 

The food makes this a 4 star."}
{"text":"We ordered take out: BBQ pork, potstickers, cashew chicken with fried rice, and scallops and vegetables. 

Positives: the potstickers were huge and tasty, and the veggies with the scallops tasted good. 

Negatives: BBQ pork was dried out and a tiny portion (but who wants a big portion of leathery pork?) for the cost, the cashew chicken had no flavor, the rice could only be described as \"brown\" and I don't think it was brown rice, the scallops tasted like bleach and were in some sort of gummy sauce.

We hate wasting money and food, but we threw out the leftovers."}
{"text":"This is my families favorite Chinese restaurant. We've been coming here for years. They have fast friendly service. We love their egg drop soup and orange chicken."}
{"text":"Um....stop wondering if this place is what you want, AND GO! 

When you drive up and walk in you're kinda like....ummmmm....

SIT 

The staff was very friendly and fast. Felt like as soon as we ordered, food was flying out. It was all fresh and tasted amazing. I had to force myself to stop eating. This will be out spot!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place...it's been there fir a long time but last time I was in area I dropped in and it wasn't goid.  The place felt dirty...there was food on floor under my table.  The food was not that goid.  I'm sure cooks have changed maybe even owners...who knows...but it wasn't what it used to be...sad."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place close to home for some quick takeout. As a family, we have eaten in the dining room a couple of times as well and we've always had a good experience. Fort take out or for dining in, the service is always friendly and fast.

As for the food, my teenage son is a big fan of the fried meat won tons, and I love the salt and pepper calamari, either for an appetizer or entree. But my favorite dish is the pan fried noodles with beef. Keep in mind that the portions are pretty big, which is great for lunch the next day. We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Right up the street from the house and the staff are very kind. When we're looking to grab some Chinese this is where we head to. They are reliable when it comes to phone orders, you know that you're going to get what you ordered. The minus star comes in because they don't deliver directly from the restaurant, although I don't know of they're available through other food delivery service. 

I believe it's family owned and operated which may be why there is not delivery. I have never had any issues digesting or feeling heavy after eating here. The Beau was tasked with obtaining something with veggies. Generally, I find the veggie options lack at other places, only a veggie or two in a bunch of sauce. This was different, it had a bunch of vegetables. I am not sure what other options were available but he fulfilled his task (he said he simply asked for veggies and she said \"ok\").

Closest best Chinese place to us and we love to support them."}
{"text":"My gripe with this place is that the food on the buffet line is not maintained at a proper and safe level. It should be held above 140 degrees but they don't do it even though the manager has been informed. This is a situation for a food poisoning waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very cheap prices. It's a hole in the wall, but the owner is super friendly and works her butt off. You have to order the egg rolls. They are the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awful!! I live a block away and will never set foot in this place again! Got the lunch special comes with a super small cup of soup, spring roll, fried rice, fried little won tons which should have come with the soup and some salad thing served on a cafeteria plate. The entree I got was low mein with shrimp, 3 small pieces of shrimp. The fried rice and the spring roll were disgusting! That was the worst Chinese food ever. Put the food in a to go box because I hardly ate any of it. Looked for a trash can to dump it as soon as I left!!"}
{"text":"I've had better and I have had worse...probably won't be returning here but if you choose to go here, I had the Kung Pau chicken. It had too much sauce but maybe that is how you like your chicken?

My boyfriend had the orange chicken which he was very disappointed in...he said Panda Express makes better orange chicken"}
{"text":"As a dental student that loves Chinese food, this is the best Chinese restaurant that's not in spring mountain.  They have everything I can ask for in a Chinese resturant, and it is super inexpensive.  I've ordered off the menu food, mabo tofu, sweet and sour pork, etc.  5 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"The sweet and sour chicken was soggy.... I like it to be crunchy and the fried rice was tasted like cheap uncle bens! Not good... Sad because it's close... Iron chef is way better and more authentic!"}
{"text":"I've been getting food here for 12+ years, and I've rarely been disappointed. Maybe once or twice in what must be several hundred meals. Inexpensive and generous portions, Great Wall is actually great. They have some of the best takeaway General Tso tofu I've ever had, with only a couple of exceptions. 

If only they delivered!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Portions are huge and food and the service is great!   Favorites are the wor wonton soup, the egg roll, shrimp fried rice,
Sweet and sour chicken (all white meat) and the king pao.  Try it!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Chinese food. Nothing fancy but the service is great and they got a good rating from the health department, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Great Wall is our family's favorite place for Chinese food. We love the owner Amy, she always greets us with a smile and seems genuinely happy to see us. Our first visit to Great Wall was 11 years ago, we have tried numerous dishes and they are all the best!!

I highly recommend Great Wall for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The Spring roll was very good as was the  Beef and Vegetables. The Wonton Chips were excellent . Unfortunately the fried rice was a total disappointment. It didn't seem freshly made and seemed more like plain brown rice than true Fried Rice . Since I really prefer Fried rice over the white, three Stars was the best I could give the meal."}
{"text":"I will be going again.  Try the Moo Shoo pork, it is pretty bomb abd the portions are big!  Just what a fat guy likes!  We took it to go because the last time we were in, it was freakin' hot in there!  I am a big dog, so I don;t want to eat and sweat, it's kind of gross for others!  But seriously good eats for a good price....you here here now!"}
{"text":"It depends what dish you get. I give their fried rice a 5 star rating.  Beef with oyster sauce (I think that was the menu name) 4 stars. Dumplings 3. Hot and Sour soup 5, Wonton 3, egg rolls 2. My expertise in Chinese food is that I grew up on home cooked Thai food and 40 miles outside of Chinatown in NYC. I think this is great \"American style\" Chinese food. I can find some of the dishes have too much vegetables and the spicy seasoning is moderate. I do think Great Wall has potential though.  Add a shredded beef with hot pepper sauce to the menu, diced chicken w hot pepper sauce. The menu doesn't have any shredded beef items.  Test these out as a special. I'm willing to stick it out w Great Wall--I know they can do it!! They also are friendly and customer service is great."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the east valley. I get the Kung Pao Chicken every time. I love it. The food is legit."}
{"text":"I love everything I get from this place. Sesame chicken, egg rolls, spring rolls, sweet and sour soup, general taos, crab puffs... it's all delicious. We were told our order would be ready in 15 minutes and I got there about 35 minutes later and everything was in a box for us which made it much easier to carry and FRESH. It tasted like they just made it. The people that work here are also very sweet but they do prefer cash rather than credit so keep that in mind. Overall, best Chinese place I have found in gilbert."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Delicious egg drop soup, chinese chicken curry, and egg foo yung. Da bomb!  Nice staff... The fried rice is fairly dark but tasty."}
{"text":"Great food. Very flavorful. Friendly staff! Had a wonderful time with my family and the portion sizes were generous. Will come again"}
{"text":"I tried this place about a month ago, and have been back at least 4 times since. So glad to finally find a Chinese food place near my house that I love. When I call in an order for pick-up, the food is ready within 10 minutes and reasonably priced. 

I've never eaten inside the restaurant myself, but it seems nice. There are always a couple waitresses busy keeping the customers happy. It's a small interior, with about 10 booths and 6 tables (which could be pushed together to accommodate a larger group). 

Great wall is in the small strip-mall just South of Walgreens (which is at Williams Field Rd). Also in the strip-mall is Sherwin Williams and Little Caesers"}
{"text":"This was my first time there. My boss told me about this place and how it has been in that location for years. It's in the same shipping center as Jimmy Deans and the Omelette House. 

I ordered a small bowl of vegetable won ton soup and a combination egg foo young. Enough to make 3 meals out of that all for $13 and I eat a lot so that says something hahaha. 

The wonton soup was yummy. The part I was excited about was the egg foo young. I was excited because not many Chinese restaurant cook it where everything is cooked w the egg and then gravy over it. Most place cooks just the egg and mix the other ingredients w the sauce which makes it not good. So I was quite happy when she told me it was cooked traditional style. 

The restaurant is nice and quiet. Not crazy busy. I did go around 12:30pm-1:30pm. Most people were just leaving or they came in after I did. 

The lady that took care of us is super friendly. It has a mom and pop vibe to it so I'm going to assume she is the main one manning the front. Super sweet lady. 

I will be ordering to go tonight and look forward to trying their hot and sour soup!

Will update the review."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food that we have had since moving to Arizona a year ago! The egg rolls are huge and always hot and fresh! Shrimp fried rice is my fav!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and quick, friendly service. What you would expect from a nice little Chinese place."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a hole in the wall?  Thats about what Great Wall is.  An old hole in the wall with a good menu and a fair price.  You can come in here and get a lunch with rice, entree and an egg roll for around $6.  You can tell the regulars in here because the wait staff know them by name.  To me, it always says a lot when you have regulars in a place like this.  

I don't know that I am up to true regular status here but I am in enough to know what I like from the menu. I've had the almond chicken, moo goo gai pan, vegetable won ton soup, hot and sour soup, paper wrapped chicken.  All the standards really.  I love the won ton soup.  It is one of my favorite soups if done right.  Here at Great Wall it is done right with a ton of full won tons, a clear clear broth and a salad bar worth of vegetables.  There is bok choy, carrots, mushrooms, water chesnuts, bamboo, pea pods.  It is delicious and surprisingly filling even when you get a small order.  

This is not the best Chinese food around but it is good.  And for me, it is convenient for lunch. It reminds me of the Chinese place I grew up eating at back home.  That is never a bad thing."}
{"text":"I like this place. The staff is very nice and helpfull. The food is good and a decent price. The portions are large and I always have leftovers. I usually stop in every week or two. I like the lemon chicken and everything else. I've tried a bit of most of the menu."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food. We're there probably once every two weeks. It's a neighborhood place so if you're looking for fancy decor or foo foo service, this might not be the place for you BUT if you look past that, this is the place. The food is always really good and they will do what you want. Add something to a dish, no problem. Low salt, no problem. Want to put something together not on the menu, tell them what you want. Could you possibly have a language issue, maybe, so be patient. Everything is fresh and they want you to be happy. Become a regular and they'll quickly become very familiar with what you like and you'll feel like it's your place too."}
{"text":"Great portions, quick service and very friendly.  Portions are big enough to share or for left overs."}
{"text":"We've been enjoying the delicious food at Great Wall for years, and I have never been disappointed.  The owners and staff are incredibly welcoming and friendly - as a matter of fact, our kids have practically adopted Miss Amy into our family!  I love the Hunan Shrimp and the Great Wall Noodle Soup (the latter is my healing food of choice when I have a bad cold).  The portions are giant...you're practically guaranteed leftovers, unless you're a NFL linebacker!  Try out this awesome restaurant - you'll be supporting your local economy and you'll LOVE the great food!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Hands down, No comparisons. I feel like I'm family every time I walk in the door."}
{"text":"Place is clean, but that's the only good thing I can say. 
Food is below average. It's not bad, just not tasty. We left more than half on table. 
We arrived at 1:15 and were served at 2:10. Service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I just love this food, it is so good and it feels genuine, not like other Chinese places. It's family owned, and the wait staff is very good. Lo mein is hard to mess up, but they really do it well"}
{"text":"Honestly the only item I tasted was the chicken fried rice. It was fabulous! I'm from St Louis and we're very particular about our fried rice. Most places serve \"tan rice with carrots and peas.\" Great Wall made it just like they do back home! The rest of my family had a variety of other menu items and they all loved it. Yes, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The made fried rice gluten free just for me! I haven't had fried rice, unless I cooked it myself, for a very long time. It was yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've eaten inside the restaurant however I usually order take to go. They do not deliver which is a bummer. The food is always quick to come out and the service is always prompt and courteous. With large portions."}
{"text":"Portions were really big, we got the honey walnut chicken and the Kung Pao beef, both were really good! Would recommend them and get again. Ordered for take out and order was ready in less than 10 minutes, would go back again."}
{"text":"The worst part of this place is that it is 45 minutes from our house :)

We took a chance on Great Wall because it was close to a theater we were going to in Queen Creek.  We figured \"How bad could it be?\"  Well, it was FABULOUS.  The best Chinese food I've eaten since moving to AZ 10 years ago.  The place was pretty full for early on a Thursday.  But the lines of people waiting to pick up or order TO GO had to be seen to be believed.  If you live in the area you're lucky so try it you'll like it.  And if you live far away like us, it may even be worth a Sunday drive to get a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"As frequent Las Vegas visitors from San Francisco, the Great Wall serves delicious Cantonese style Chinese food. This is our favorite, go to restaurant in Las Vegas. Service is prompt. Prices are very reasonable. Do give them a try. I think you'll really enjoy your meal there."}
{"text":"Slap me on the a$$ and call me Daniel Son. I've been here twice now, and both times were killer. Don't trip when you pull up to the janky curb appeal. Don't turn away when you find that it's empty inside. The location sucks but the food rocks. The large beef egg rolls are stupid good. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Gilbert for Chinese! It's always fresh and hot. We love the Chow Mein and General Tso's chicken! It is never too crowded and we can get right in for an easy family dinner. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The price is right, and the food is alright.

It was my first time here and I ordered the ma pao tofu and had a great time.

The place is your standard hole-in-the-great-wall, don't expect much if you're looking for ambiance. I was super excited when I found out both the server lady and the chef spoke fluent Cantonese and they were both super nice to not just me, but to everyone as well.

I will definitely go back to try more items. Fast, good, and cheap."}
{"text":"God damn some of the the best Chinese. I'm only typing after I've tasted the appetiZers.very delicious would come back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Vegas. They have great customer service the lady behind the counter is very friendly. The prices are really good not expensive. Their tempura fried egg rolls are really good at must have."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this particular restaurant for almost 10 yrs now.  The last year or so, we haven't been that happy with their food or service !! So we have been trying some other  chinese restaurants in the east valley.  And believe it or not there are some very very good ones on this side of the valley.

Today, we were driving by the Great Wall on Higley and decided to give it a chance again.
By that I mean the last 3 or 4 times the food was never HOT, barely warm and not really up to par.

Well, I wish we would of kept on going, I ordered the sweet & sour battered shrimp (the shrimp was very very small, and the batter made it look like it was huge.  And the batter was not cooked inside, very raw - like pancake batter), not to good at all !!!  I mention this to the waitress who usually acts like she doesn't speak a word of english (esp. with a complaint).  She did say oh, yes I have heard this before they didn't fry it long enough and it is undercooked.  I'll talk to the owner........hands up in the air..........sorry or as if to say :tough luck\".....

The owner or the waitress never came and apologized, or said anything about my concerns.
I wasn't looking for a free meal......but alittle acknowlgment  would of been nice.

TOO MANY OTHER GREAT CHINESE OR ASIAN RESTAURANTS OUT THERE, so I'm sure to say this was the last time !! I would patronize sub par food or service again."}
{"text":"Came in this little authentic place for a business lunch and it was great! Not in the best area and kind of hidden but consider it a hidden gem, it's priced cheap and the food is amazing. I've had my fair share of Chinese food but this definitely takes the cake....or the fortune cookie? I wish we could frequent here more often but it's too far from our side of town, but if I am in the area, lunch is on me :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by numerous neighbors on Nextdoor.com so we decided to give it a try. We've eaten at many Chinese restaurants in the valley and, apart from George & Sons, found most of them to be mediocre at best. We were quite surprised to find Great Wall rivaling and perhaps besting George & Sons. The place is nothing fancy, a typical storefront restaurant, but don't let that sway you. Service was friendly and fast. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef as well as Wor Wonton soup. The soup could have been an entree with all the chicken, shrimp, beef and vegetables it contained. 
We took half of our entrees home and enjoyed them equally for lunch the next day. I think we've found our regular Chinese restaurant. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great dive with excellent food. Interior is old and grungy, so if you are eating in and want a clean atmosphere, then this isn't the place for you. However, you would be missing out on excellent and cheap food! Best Egg Drop Soup in Las Vegas IMO"}
{"text":"Drove by and saw there was a Chinese food place close by.  Stopped in for take out lunch.  There was no one in there but the lady at the counter was as nice as could be.  Order sweet and sour chicken and some egg drop soup.  As I waited there were at least five take out orders that came in and several pick ups.  So this has to be a good sign, I thought.  I was right the chicken was hot and crispy, sauce was good.  Egg drop soup was good.  I couldn't eat it all so lunch portion was a healthy size.  Later that evening the littles were hungry and I warmed it up.  My daughter really enjoyed it.  We will be back.  I may order the sauce on the side next time just so the chicken is still crispy for the left over reheat.  :)"}
{"text":"Best egg rolls in vegas. Good prices and a lot of food and the service is nice.  They can be a little slow when it gets crowded because there only seems to be 1 or 2 people service and 1 cooking in the back."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Potions of each entree you choose serves about 3-4 people. Lucy was our server she was very nice. It is a hole in the wall place but the inside is clean, as well as the restroom. Didnt have to wait to be seated. Our food didnt take long to come out either."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. We found it on accident a year ago while in Vegas and remembered to eat here again. Portions are big, prices are small and food is super yummy. The owner is so sweet. Lots of regulars in and out showing how good it truly is. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was way better than we were expecting! Great service, nothing fancy, and great food! Looks like they are doing well for a local joint which says a lot."}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Friendly service. I've been here twice and it's a hidden location near a tattoo shop. The food is good and large portions!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have been going here for years. Lucy knows my name and exactly what I like to order. Food is amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really like the ladies that work here. They are super nice. This is a hole in the wall, kind of older, family run style of restaurant. I like that it is not a chain. The food portions are large and the bill is small."}
{"text":"Went back for a dine in experience.  FYI on a weekday, during lunch it does get crowded and busy.  The service will be slow because there is just one person bringing everything out and taking orders.  

My food was just as good as the first time.  Although, I could have used a larger serving of sweet and sour, instead of having to keep asking for more. 

There are no fountain drinks, so you have to drink free water or buy can sodas.  

I love the deep fried shrimp.  The orange chicken was also deep fried and so amazingly delicious. I love breaded deep fried chicken, or shrimp and not too many places make it."}
{"text":"This place has become my go to for Chinese food! The menu has plenty of options to choose from and everything we've ordered has been delicious. We usually order for pickup and it's always between 10-15 minutes before it's ready. 

The food portions are huge! There's always something leftover for later on - which is great. 

I'd recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food , period. Busy takeout business. 
They are going to be Open For Christmas, Crazy, but it's just my husband and I this year so...yep Chinese it will be. Oh, Open New Years too"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a long time but I always forget to write a review. We drive a long way just to eat here. I haven't tried anything I haven't liked. The dining room is always very clean and the staff is very friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay but the service is poor and the restaurant is a little on the dirty side (ceiling was nasty). Sodas are canned. Parking lot was full of homeless folks. I'd probably pass on going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food. We ordered takeout for 5 people and got an assortment of dishes: Crab puffs, Kung Pao Chicken, Veggie Lo mein, Pork with mixed veg, Veg Fried Rice, String Beans in garlic sauce. Standard dishes are what you would expect. Spring rolls are light and crunchy. The fried dumplings were a little soft but we picked up the order - they are probably fresher if you eat in. Would order from them again - pick up was fast - within 10 minutes of calling. Ask for chop sticks if you want to use them."}
{"text":"I was really craving chinese food so we picked this up a couple nights ago. Super fast and pretty good! We got the plain lo mein, egg drop soup, egg fried rice, and crab puffs. I wasn't a fan of the crab puff filling, seemed like it was just cream cheese. Everything else was spot on! I'm glad it's close and maybe some day they'll deliver ;-)"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews we stopped here for a late lunch.  Nicer on the inside than the outside.  We ordered egg rolls, dumplings, shrimp with lobster sauce, mongolian beef, and general tso's chicken (I was there with my in-laws so nothing too challenging.)
The egg rolls were hot and crispy, and the dumplings perfect without that overly thick dumpling wrapper.  
The shrimp with lobster sauce and the mongolian beef were perfect with a confident wok he that differentiated them from less good versions.  The chicken was OK, it had a thicker batter that I don't care for but the chicken itself was tender and tasted like high quality meat.
Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Decided to try based on reviews. Started with a cup of Egg Drop soup- tasty! Then we had, Chicken Chop Suey - tasty with a light sauce and their specialty Mongolian Beef- OUTSTANDING! The menu says it is a spicy dish so we ordered it mild. Entrees came as VERY LARGE portions. We'll come again."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Candice and Titus.  This place is very average, at best.  Tried it tonight for the first (and only) time and while it might be the best in the neighborhood, I would certainly pass this up for Panda Express anytime.  Sad, but true. They are friendly and pleasant, service is quick, tho not efficient.  Had to ask for iced tea refills 3 times, not ever offered.  Food came but we had to wait a while for our plates.  First dish arrived while we had barely started our soup.  The honey walnut shrimp were pathetic.  Mushy shrimp, water logged broccoli and lousy sauce which tasted like mayo from the jar, and not good mayo at that.  Heavy on the vegetables is right.  Never had a plate full of soggy broccoli with a few walnut shrimp on top.  Ordered the eggplant in spicy garlic sauce, one of my favorites and couldn't even eat this one and sent it back.  Also soggy, bland, the worst ever.  Never saw such a brown color wonton soup either.  And it had an unpleasant smell.  That should have been a clue.  I can go on and on but I think that is enough.  You get my drift."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! Great Orange chicken, Kung pao chicken and wonton soup. Not a fan of the egg rolls as they are pretty greasy. Other than that we haven't had anything we didn't like. This place is perfect for a family of 6- the take out positions are large!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and ordered my usual Mongolian Beef. While initially the flavor was good, after eating about half the plate the saltiness of the food became too much and I had to stop. 
I do however plan to return and try some other menu items before giving up all hope."}
{"text":"We get take out often - it is always good & the order is always correct. Large portions so the prices are reasonable. Very friendly staff make you feel welcome - every time!"}
{"text":"The best take-out or dine in Chinese restaurant at a really great price! 
The lunch and dinner specials are well varied without being too restrictive in options, like some other places in town."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is not so bad... Most of the food we ordered was well prepared and very flavorful. The dining area is casual and comfortable. The lighting that hangs over the tables is left behind from some Italian place that used to be there ( guessing). There is an old calendar hung in the bathroom from 2013 lol. It is very clean though and there is a fish tank which the kids love. My big issues with this place are, 1. The fried rice, we had fried rice with our meal, it was over steamed white rice with to much soy sauce on it. One bite in and I knew it was horrible. It was clumpy and mushy. When I let the owner, Amy, know she was happy to replace it with white rice but she was insisting that the rice was good, and that is how they made it. I would be ashamed to serve that to anyone. Second they served our food in a Japanese bento box fashion. It made eating awkward. It's doubtful that I would be a return customer. There are just to many better options out there."}
{"text":"Another good lunch at Great Wall. I had their Sweet & Sour Pork though it did look great, it's not one of their best dishes? The only reason I have it a 4 Stars was for that reason. The portions are generous as every dish is, but it was too much sauce and the flavor did not do it for me?   I've had better. I was expecting one of the best sauces from them, but it didn't cut it really! Their fried rice they serve with it, tho you can't beat the prices on their (lunch special) is a little bit on the plain side, no scrambled egg in it even..I noticed.    But at least they dont use broken rice, which is a big plus for me. That seems to be almost the norm here in Chinese food in Vegas. Not even China town is any good after you've tried Chinese in Miami, New York? Their vegetable spring roll was on spot though!         The plus here is the hostess/waitress She truly makes the experience, bless her heart. Very warm and always strikes up a conversation. This is the (only dish) I haven't really liked too much. All the other ones have been Bomb so far!!! It's worth your trip to this place, it's in a centralized location in Vegas with old time prices that don't break your bank $6.10 Lunch Special, guys........."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Chinese restaurant ever.  The food is great and consistent from visit to visit.  The service is friendly whenever we eat in."}
{"text":"I traveled quite a ways to eat here this afternoon.  Got off work early and had a rare craving for good chinese food.  The reviews were good so I traveled the distance.
Resturaunt was very clean...Every detail touched...a big plus for me, especially after my horrible experience at the Gilbert Floridino's two weeks ago.  Anyway...server was sweet, but a significant language barrier.
Since it was my first time, I kept it simple.  Chicken Lo Mein.  It was truly the best I have had.  The vegetables crisp, chicken and noodles cooked just right with savory flavors.  An excellent cook myself, I can identify.
The language barrier incurred an extra charge for fried rice, that I did not order...I noticed this when I was given the bill, and I mentioned to the nice server that I did not order that...she clearly did not understand...she was placing all my leftovers in the box and accidentally dumped the full 32 oz glass of water all over me.
I'm pretty darn laid back...I told her it was ok...I helped her clean up the water.  I was disappointed, not because I was drenched and cold, but because I never received an apology.
Regardless...it can not take away from the delicious food and atmosphere...very quaint.  I will return."}
{"text":"I came here with some co-workers because it's a stone's throw away from our office. The restaurant was bigger than it looked outside and had several tables and booths and large round tables.

We sat ourselves and our drink orders were placed.  Lunch special was $5.95 which included an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll. I ordered the veggie chow mein and egg drop soup. The food was very bland and wasn't that flavorful. Service was attentive and prices were reasonable.

Today, my co-worker (who noticed I was sick) ordered me their sweet and sour soup. It was delightful.

Not the greatest, most authentic Chinese in the land. Great prices, good service, and it does the trick."}
{"text":"The food was never great here. But now it's gotten WAY worse. Talk about dry and horribly bland Chinese food. Wow!"}
{"text":"If you like good Chinese food in a nice envirinment, this isn't the place.  Booths are torn up.  Food is bland and bad.  We ordered 4 dishes, and they served Kung pow chicken, woth cashews on it, mostly chunks of water chestnuts, and nothing else, it was bad.  Sauces were watery on beef broccoli, and not good.  Rice was cold and not good.  Pretty bad.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"I first tried Great Wall with a couple of friends of mine: one of whom had never really had Chinese food and one who was already a big fan of their food.

With good reason.

This place is awesome! The servers are nice and are right on the ball. The food doesn't take too long.

And then, there's the food. Oh my God, the food is amazing!

First off, the Happy Platter is so good and completely worth the $4.50. Especially the chicken skewers that char at your table while you eat the rest of the appetizer. The sizzling rice soup is also insanely good. The best part of their menu has to be the sesame beef, it honestly is the best in the Valley. The edges of each piece are crisp and crunchy while the center is tender and the sauce is perfectly tangy.

I've been back a couple times already and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for a good, decent Chinese food place since we moved to Vegas over a year ago. We have been up and down China Town, spring mountain road, several times trying to find one place that was edible. We have not returned to NY of them.
We came across The Great Wall of China while we were going to our physical therapist.  The only thing good about therapy was finding this great hole in the wall. 
We make this a weekly stop now. Great food served hot and fresh by the nicest lady in the world! She has made us feel like family now.  
We have tried several items on the menu but my favorite has been the garlic chicken combo with fried rice, egg rolls, and egg drop soup to start. The egg drop soup is by far the BEST I have had anywhere.  It is very thick and flavorful!!!The man's favorite meal has been the Mongolian beef. The meat is tender and flavorful, lots of meat, not all vegetables! 
If you are looking for a great Chinese place to eat with great prices, served hot and fresh...give The Great Wall of China a try!!!"}
{"text":"If you are pretentious, stuck up, or  a snob; please do us all a favor and stay the hell out of here. This is probably one of the best kept secrets in Vegas and we locals really don't need you wanna be food critics ruining the name of an absolutely delightful local eatery. This place would be a perfect candidate for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and we sincerely hope Guy Fieri never finds it.

After living in the Southwest for nearly a decade, we despaired of ever finding anything resembling edible Chinese food again. However, the human determination to continue a hopeless quest eternally endures.  After driving by this place several times, we finally decided to give it a try several months ago. When we pulled up, my wife looked at me and said, \"I am not sure I want to go in here, it looks scary.\" My response was, \"I am hungry, we'll go in, look around and if we don't like what we see, we can leave.\" Well, we almost left after going in. Gordon Ramsay or Robert Irvine would burst a capillary looking at the interior. Which to my way of thinking meant \"Good Eats\" were on the horizon.

So, we sat at a table that was made from the petrified forest (not really) and in chairs that Jackie Gleason probably sat on while he was performing here in Vegas. It appears that this is a true Mom and Pop establishment. Mom runs front of the house and Dad cooks.
We were brought our menus promptly which at first glance looked like the standard fare we have grown used to.

My wife ordered the Won Ton Soup (there are multiple varieties) and I ordered the Egg Flower. (There is an odd property that it seems is only possessed by the Chinese Wok and can only be accomplished by a Master Chinese Chef and that is making liquid hotter than boiling without evaporating, so take care.)Our soup was brought to us with those ridiculous looking chinese soup spoons, which I now know are designed to keep you from giving yourself third degree burns.  I was about to get my first taste and was preparing myself to reach for the salt/pepper shakers, when much to my great delight, I discovered that neither was required. The soup was seasoned perfectly.  (To date, we have had the Egg flower soup, the Won Ton Soup, The Shrimp Won Ton Soup, and the Beef Noodles soup. Do yourself a favor, before you die, try the beef noodle soup. But tell everyone watching you eat it that it is terrible. If they taste it, you will not get to finish it. Seriously, it's that darn good.)

For the appetizer, we ordered what the menu describes as \"Spring Egg Rolls\". I could dedicate an entire review to these tasty delights. First off, they are not Halal or Kosher, they contain pork. You get two with an order, and they are not your father's egg rolls. These are amazing. These egg-rolls are huge and unless I am mistaken, they are tempura. When they bring them to your table, they are cut in half. One of these is the equivalent of two anywhere else. They come with a lovely yet subtle sweet and sour sauce. Every time we order from here, we get an order of these, and my wife, who hates egg rolls always eats one of them. This is the only appetizer we have ordered.

For the main course, I ordered the tangerine beef (which to you philistines, politically correct eaters, and those with general eating disorders is the beef equivalent of Orange Chicken). Our hostess was quick to point out that this dish is spicy. I was skeptical.My wife ordered the Chicken Chop Suey which is a Special Dinner Combination Plate. I must stop and interject at this point, there is no Duck on the menu. If you will notice, the letter f is not in the word duck. This means there is no F in Duck on the menu. Don't ask, she will not be happy with you. Back to our regularly scheduled review. A little while later, our wonderful hostess/waitress/phone answerer brought out at least three metric tons of food. The aforementioned tangerine beef was spiced to perfection. Just enough heat to dance on my taste buds but not hot enough to make me break out in a foreign language, get the hiccups, or need to be immediately taken to the ER.  My wife enjoyed her chop suey, however I cannot fully remember her comments as I was in the throw of mouth-gasms. 

While there was enough food for us to take to an orphanage left over, we decided instead to be selfish and keep it. We brought it home and ate it again the next day to similar delight. 

On a side note, when we ate in, fortune cookies came with the bill.....

Since our first incursion to this well kept secret establishment we have tried the following main courses as well:
Mongolian Beef, yes, spicy and tender. However, you must love onions.
The Great Wall Fried Rice- accept no substitutes. This is a meal unto itself.
Moo Goo Gai Pan which was plentiful, flavorsome, and had a good variety of vegetables.
Shrimp Chow Mein. They do not short you on the shrimp and they are cooked perfectly.


Shrimp with Tomatoes.....Where do I begin with this one? Just awesome...a review for another tim"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. I actually think Panda Express is better than this place."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we werent \"wowed\".

When we walked in, all of the booth benches had huge rips and masking tape holding them together. We sat dowb and the cloth napkins smelled like mold or undried laundry.

The service was awesome, fast and friendly. Huge menu and reasonable prices. My husband loved the Mongolian beef but the fried rice had no flavor or veggies. My orange chicken wasnt crispy and was very strong in orange flavor but the chowmein i got as my side ($2 upcharge) was real good. 

Our potsticker appetizer came after our meal and was just ok. Very big but not super delish."}
{"text":"okay at best. Fried shrimp was thick with breading and very greasy. ended up removing the thick greasy breading. The fried rice was okay, nothing to write home about. Service was okay. I would stop in again if I'm hungry and want Chinese food. But the fried shrimp is a no-no."}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are reasonable and the food is prepared quickly.  Phone in an order and it is ready for pick up in about 10-15 minutes.  The give huge portions which is good for another whole meal and then some.  Too bad they don't have sushi."}
{"text":"Great food our go to spot for Chinese food.

Fried rice and egg foo young is exceptional!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I ever ate in cleveland. I love Chinese food,  I went there Tuesday evening. I ordered a shrimp egg foo young combination with chicken fried rice and (4) wings. 

After waiting 20 minutes for my order which was no problem because I love my food hot and fresh.

They forgot to put my wings in the bag so I had to turn around and go back. The lady at the counter threw in an extra wing for my troubles. Ok cool.

I get home open my food take a bit of my egg foo young it taste burnt and it taste like it was dipped in some fish oil giving it a Medicine taste of Father Johns cold medicine, and the rice was hard. The wings were hard and old looking when I broke the wing open the meat was brown.  They tasted like old dirty grease. I drove from Shaker Hts to Turney Road plaza for this garbage food. Never again in life will I eat there and I'll discourage anyone I know from eating there including my Dog!"}
{"text":"Really good food. The wait time for to-go orders can get to be a little much, so make sure you call in advance. We have tried quite a few things off the menu and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"The food is not very good and our children's meals were brought out first and one by one our adult meals were delivered about 15 minutes apart; my wife's being the lady at 45 minutes after the kids food was delivered. 

The staff is not friendly or engaging and they do not take accountability for their lack of cleanliness or professionalism. 

I would not recommend this place for anything but a Department of Health review."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place got 4 stars overall for slow service & poor quality.
When I came for lunch, there was only 1 server who was also the cashier. The set up was terrible that I had to walk by in front of people while they were talking face to face with each other, or leeching all around to find my way out the door.
Anyways, she seated me at a table that wasn't even clean, because the booth section I asked to sit at wasn't open at the time. A couple mins later, a gentleman sat at the booth, and she decided to move me over to the booth section. Yay! It was close a min ago, now it's open!
I ordered hot & sour soup (L), and beef with broccoli (came w/ rice). The soup came after 15 mins od waiting. 5 more mins (20 total) passed by, and still no beef w/ broccoli. I went to the front & asked her when my food would be coming. She was surprised that I asked for my beef/broccoli to come at the same with the soup. (I supposed she expected me to finish the soup first then she would have brought out the main dish? Mind you I ordered a large bowl of soup, not a cup like at Panera Bread).
A few mins later, she brought me the beef w/ broccoli. She commented that everyone else was waiting as well, so she actually did me a favor, I guess?
As far as the quality of food was just terrible. The hot & sour soup was mostly liquid. No meat, no mushrooms, no shrimp, etc. Hot & sour soup from ChinaOne would be 10x better than the soup here. Mind you she didn't bring out the soy sauce (You must add soy sauce; otherwise, you just taste the vinegar. I was too afraid to bother her!!!! The beef w/ broccoli was very plain. The broccoli was old, I could taste it.
I will never come back here again. I would not recommend this place if you take someone out on a first date (even if you were so broke), or you might not get a second date. LOL!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying, I am a huge Asian cuisine fan. Eaten many different chinese spots on various continents and this place is amongst the top in terms of taste and consistency. Really good portion size, casual laid back atmosphere and a really sweet staff. If I am ever in the area, this is where I am eating!"}
{"text":"Always great! Fresh and made to
Order and you can watch them make it. Restaurant is usually always clean looking. Has been my local go to Chinese place for many years."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We have been looking for a chinese restaurant like this in vegas, good food, big portions and great service."}
{"text":"Best Damn Chinese food in Vegas! Atmosphere is nice and most importantly, quiet! Every time I call or come in for a quick lunch, I get treated like family....hidden gem. Anyone who lives in Vegas and loves Chinese food MUST check this place out"}
{"text":"This is one of the best little family-owned Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.  The server was fast and friendly (although it may have helped that we were the only people there.  But the food speaks for itself.  Everything tastes very traditional and flavorful. From the egg drop soup to the crab wontons that melt in your mouth to the spring roll, it was all very delicious.  My wife had the lo mein and I had the sesame chicken. Both dishes were served steaming hot and cooked perfectly. I have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"When we travel down to AZ to visit our friends, we usually end up trying new eateries... and this time was not any different. We were in the mood for some chinese food.. but not like Panda.. REAL chinese food.. and let's just say that I was pleasantly surprised! This place is located in a little strip mall so it can be easy to miss.. but you definitely have to try. Food was delicious and the service was great. Check it out."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews are my go too! Great Wall has either very good or bad . So I had to check it out !
First of yes I am Foodie I love  good food I make good food and I expect good food when I go out. This said I'm having major kitchen refacing done . So I'm doing take out this week. We ordered the orange chicken which in my opinion did not have enough sauce it was good but I personally want more sauce. The Vegetable  Egg Foo young and yes anyone who really knows . it's supposed to be made with with bean sprouts  it was amazing and comes with gravy ! My husband was in heaven . The pot stickers are huge and Delicious and the Combination Lo Mein was excellent. My only side note was yes I usually dine in and I didn't check out the decor or bathroom's . So that said I would love to eat here again with my family the take out service was amazing."}
{"text":"I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because I think the decor could be a little better. 

The food is one of the best take outs in the valley. Everything has always tasted great and fresh.

The portions are humongous! My husband and I typically split an entree and can't even finish it. 

We've had: Lo mein dishes, Kung Pao, Sesame Chicken, Dynamite Beef, General Tsos, Spring rolls, and pot stickers - all have been excellent."}
{"text":"First time ever I said no to to go boxes. We had three different entrees and left half of each one on the table. 
Panda Express, half the money, better product."}
{"text":"Tried this last night with the fam w/ a Groupon. Was pleasantly surprised. Mongolian beef, orange chicken and king pao chicken were very good!! Definitely would order those again. The lo mein and egg foo young were ehh... not the best but NOT the worse. Was VERY pricey though. Would go back but not without another coupon."}
{"text":"Right down the street, food is done quickly, always hits the spot. Staff is very nice. Egg Drop soup leaves something to be desired but what can ya do?"}
{"text":"Been here several times. This is one of our Christmas dinner restaurants. I love this place. The food is fresh and super tasty. I eat vegetarian, so the spring rolls are perfect, and there is a whole 'veggie' section of the menu.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm really confused how this place has so many good reviews.  It needs to be cleaned, the service was not great, the food was so bad we literally took one bite and asked for the check to so we could just leave. The waitress asked if we wanted to go boxes when we refused she said, \"oh what you didn't like it?\"  followed by a laugh as she walked away to run our card."}
