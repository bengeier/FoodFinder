{"text":"This place is horrible, close up shop again like they did last time and STAY closed.
Same staff same BAD attitude for WHAT lousy service with a bad attitude and horrible food. The owners and chefs seem all drunk. Do not know what their pompous deal is could not cook themselves out of a McDonald's bag This place is shameful."}
{"text":"A new favorite restaurant!

We have come here a couple of times this summer and both times were great!  We have sat at the bar and enjoyed appetizers and wine!  Recently, we had dinner with friends on a Saturday night.  Both times the servers were friendly, polite and helpful!  Both times the food and drinks were excellent.
The calamari fritte with spicy aioli and the Arancini risotto stuffed with beef ragu are delicious appetizers!  For dinner we had the veal funghetto  with 
Farfalle Alfredo, and, the pan roasted Florida Black Grouper, both were 
Prepared perfectly!  The new owners are doing a good job!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live this place!  Owners are very nice and accommodating! It's hard to find a place that will actually make sure that the soda is carbonated when they make you a drink! If there's anything that annoys me, is being given an eight dollar drink with flat pop! It's that kind of detail that keeps me coming back. And he will make you any combination of food off the menu."}
