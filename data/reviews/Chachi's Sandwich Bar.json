{"text":"A new Chachi's sandwich shop franchise has opened up in the old Culture's food court location in Market Mall. It's been a while since I've been to a Chachi's, and the menu has changed quite a bit since those early days downtown in TD Square, mostly for the better from what I remember.  Unfortunately, despite having some great fillings on their freshly made sandwiches, the biggest fault when I stopped in the other day was the bread. Chachi's website says: \"We believe you need a great bun for a great sandwich\" and I couldn't agree more. The bread for my sandwich (and my wife's), however, was tough and rubbery for the most part. Without good bread, the rest of the sandwich just can't stack up.  I'd give Chachi's a 2.5 stars if I could - it's worth a try, but not A-OK due to both the bread issue and the overly high prices."}
{"text":"We hadn't tried out this little gem yet so decided to as you could pronounce all the ingredients in their food :) all fresh and real food! my husband tried the beef brisket with Mac and cheese on top and I had the Cali chicken special of the day. We Ended up sharing each other's and were both super happy with the sandwiches! They were yummy! Would definitely go back again! And the staff were so nice and friendly it was a refreshing experience!"}
{"text":"I just paid $14 for a kale salad that only half filled the container and a dried out pickle. The crostini is hard as a rock and hard to bite into. I noticed when making the salad that there wasn't much dressing so I asked for a side luckily. I k ow this is half the kale as I had a salad here before and it was massive. Very disappointed!!! I've posted my photos in photos section."}
{"text":"I have been to this chachis a couple of times and it's always been great. Frankly this is the only place I would eat at Market Mall."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I love the clubbin. Glad to see local ingredients. Need a store in beltline!!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey sandwich with salt chips and the bun was extremely fresh! The entire sandwich was delicious and so were the chips. The variety of different sandwiches was impressive. I also like how you can build your own sandwich."}
{"text":"Very unique. Could smell the fresh sandwiches being made from across the food court. Had the Bahn Mi sandwich, and ordered a Vanilla Bourbon Lemonade which was very refreshing. Sandwich was a nice break from the usual sandwiches at other places. Went back for an interesting ice cream sandwich that I seen there as well. Almost looked like a huge Nanaimo bar and was great. Haven't had something quite like it. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to grab and go! However, I prefer to come here because it is tucked away from the busy catacombs of the plus 15. Regardless of time of day, you can get away from the crowded sea of humanity and noise of the plus 15 or down town restaurants and not have to line up too long to get something.   Because it is off the beaten path it is a surprisingly great place to have a conversation with someone because it is relatively quiet. I have rarely seen the table full here, even during the lunch rush.  The sandwiches are wonderful and reasonably priced. For $6.95 I can get a short Italian sandwich that is both satisfying and filling. They also have a great Mac n' Cheese for the same price (large, small is $3.95 I think) that is also delicious and generous in proportion.   I seem to keep coming back regularly!"}
{"text":"My sandwich at Chachi's was good but I couldn't help but feel that it would have been better if had been toasted or something.  It was just missing....something to make it great.  I won't rush to go back because I don't think it is that much better than subway or other sandwich shops.  I wanted to love it, really I did, but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich chain out there. Make sure to order one of their pickles!"}
{"text":"Work has been ridiculously busy for me this week and especially today when I have started my first day of quitting smoking, yay me! I've been passing by Chachi's for months now but haven't had the urge to step food into the place to see what it was all about. I guess you could say it is more of a gourmet-esque Subway/Quizno's. I don't have much time for lunch today so I went there to grab a sub.   I didn't know you could customize your own sub, they have little clipboards where you can go through and choose everything from breads, spreads and the things that go in between. I think this is a cool idea and lets you really customize what they have to offer you and that in my books is pretty dope.  This is a really small place but you're greeted by the cutest older Asian lady with her sandwich makers, I especially love when people are friendly and acknowledge you as soon as you walk through the entrance of the place.  I grabbed a Chicken and Havarti on Wholewheat Bread which consisted of Chicken Breast, Havarti Cheese, Basil Pesto, Dijon, Red Onions, Lettuce and Tomatoes. My overall thought was that it tasted good but not great. I mean, I'm not too sure what it is lacking but it tastes a little bland right off the bat to me. However, the size of the sub makes up for it totally because eating half of it just a few moments ago I am totally stuffed and can probably save the rest for dinner. Price for my sub was $9.98, including GST.  If I'm in a rush, need a quick place to have a sub that is in my building I'll definitely come by here again and try out something new."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwitxh. Yes. I did it.  Pork with mac n cheese sandwitch. Verdict:  try it. It's good.    Next experiment the beef with coleslaw.  10/10 for the delicious gourmet bread they use!   Molto bene !! ;)"}
{"text":"I used to go to the high school near this Chachi's, and I would often choose to get my lunch from here. The prices are a bit high, but I think you get what you pay for- the sandwiches and components are always fresh and tasty. I like the deli atmosphere, and this particular location is surprisingly not too busy around lunchtime. The staff are very efficient and nice. There's one guy who works behind the till who'll flip your change over his shoulder into his other hand before he gives it to you, I find it entertaining haha.  Although, Chachi's advertises \"to die for\" macaroni and cheese, and too be honest it wasn't that special. Just macaroni and cheese with pepper, was what I got at least."}
{"text":"Clubbin sandwich is the absolute best and staff are always friendly. Although pricey, you have the least chance of food poisoning from this restaurant compared to others in the mall"}
{"text":"Western Canada's idea of a Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich? C'mon...why even bother having this on your menu if you're not going to do it right? Ciabatta bread, tough as shoe leather. You shouldn't have to struggle or exert yourself when biting into a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich, yet this is what happens at Chachi's. Very difficult to chew, and toasted too long, which certainly didn't help matters.  Not sure why Chachi's doesn't use rye bread, which is the correct bread for this sandwich. Perhaps this a way for them to streamline inventory, maximize storage space, longer storage life, cut costs, etc. Like I said...then why even bother?  Here's an idea; Given the fact this is a classic Montreal style sandwich, and you're not willing to use the proper bread, then why not use a French style baguette? Much easier to chew, and it's relevant to the whole French theme.  Honestly, one of THE worst Montreal Smoked Meat sandwiches I've ever eaten. But hey, out here in Alberta most wouldn't know the difference anyways right?   After discarding the bread, the meat was decent enough (hence my 2 star rating). Be sure to grab a plastic fork though, as you'll need it.  Based on some of the other reviews, I'm not alone on this bread thing.  I should add that the staff are very friendly. Shame the sandwich isn't."}
{"text":"I order catering from Chachi's Market Mall regularly and these guys are great to work with. They are always on time, easy to communicate, polite, helpful and, most importantly, their sandwiches and salads are always extremely fresh. They are also very accommodating - we are unable to pick up the order so they deliver to our office. I always try to give them bigger orders just to support their business. I can't comment on other locations but I work with 5-6 different caterers on a regular basis and we never had any issues with Chachi's Market Mall team."}
{"text":"A little pricey but a really delicious sandwich.   My brother ordered the pulled pork mac 'n cheese and I had a toasted spicy chicken. Contrary to other reviewers, i adored the ciabatta rolls that were used. The outer crust had a really good chew but the inside was nice and soft. Both our sandwiches contained a bit of heat, mine from hot sauce.  All of the ingredients tasted really fresh and not the least bit processed.   It is kind of nice to have food of this quality in a mall setting. I will look for Chaci's again."}
{"text":"This particular day I met up with a special date at Chinook mall to try out Chachi's. By special date, I meant me agreeing to my buddy JP's whims of meeting up for eats close to where he works. Just two easy going guys sitting side-by-side in a mall bench, slumming it up with their sandwiches and mac n' cheese.  I had the Tuscan sandwich, which had salami, capicollo, provolone, basil pesto, and red pepper spread, with a few veggie fixings. I also figured that I probably won't have the appetite to eat for the night so I decided to carb up by ordering a side order of mac n' cheese. The sandwich was good: meat and cheese were tasty and the veggies were fresh. I like how the shredded lettuce wasn't so sloppily packed in which is what I usually find in most fast-food sandwiches where it sometimes looks like a birds nest when I unwrap everything. The mac n' cheese was surprisingly good, but I don't know if it's the kind everyone can enjoy. I like mine with a lot of sauce and with a sharp cheddar taste. I also liked how it already had flakes of pepper mixed in.  The overall experience of going to this particular Chachi's location was OK, I wouldn't want to do it again seeing as the traffic and parking experience @ Chinook makes for a huge time-burn in a limited work lunch-hour. However Chachi's was pretty good and I would consider it as a meal alternative if I ever find myself near any one of it's franchise locations."}
{"text":"I love their Cali Sandwich! Best place for grab and go when you're at the YYC airport. They have variety of sandwiches and the best thing is all ingredients are locally made and harvest. Let's support our own. #supportlocal #patronizelocal"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich. A place in mall with real good gourmet sandwich. I had the pulled pork with Mac n cheese and it was amazing. Do get the pickle on the side :). A very trendy and rustic looking place. Te service was great and they actually took the time to ask my name and write it on the box. Btw they use cardboard instead of plastic. Great little place, would definitely come back to try some other sandwiches, next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Stale bread.   Banmi should be left for the vietnamrse sub shops.   If I could I would take it back.   Mac and cheese was overdone and the meat on it was off smellinf and tasting.  The prpperoni was dry and very old.  The jerky has an odd fishy taste like its past its due date.  Why else keep it in the fridge???  Id skip the pickle as their color is offf..  people say its good but why????  Same as arbys imho.   I might try anothrr sandwitch  just to be sure."}
{"text":"Honestly... nothing to write home about. You could get the same sanwich experience at Subway and save money at the same time."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are out of this world yumminess!  Of course, I tried the signature Pulled Pork / Macaroni and Cheese Sandwich and it was delish.  The salted kettle chips were just ok, but the jalapeno kettle chips were great.  My husband tried the Club sandwich and it was great as well.  Nothing bad about this place at all!"}
{"text":"Good tender beef in ciabatta bread with spicy mayo, carrots and jalapenos."}
{"text":"I agree with Craig S.  The stuffing was good; we had the Banh Mi and the Montreal Smoked Meat but the bread was overly crunchy at the top due to it being over-toasted in the oven and therefore, too difficult to take a bite.  I had to rip off the crunchy top before I could eat anything at all.  Only 2 stars from me 'cos of the tough bread."}
{"text":"We were in the shopping around the Market Mall area when we were hungry.  Trying to figure out where to eat is always struggle so I recommended the food court in the mall.  The mall closes at 9PM and it was around 8:15PM when we walked around the food court looking at our options.  Note: We were hangry.  We walked past bourbon street and had a sample and Michelle was set on getting bourbon but I told her let's keep looking because there were more places.  A few steps later, we were in front of a nice looking vendor \"CHACHIS\" I kinda freaked because I forgot about this place and been wanting to give them a try.  I took a look at the sandwiches on the board and had a hard time deciding.  In the midst of deciding, I glanced over and there was a sign that showed they sold fiasco gelato ice cream sandwiches *emoji with heart eyes*  DROOL!    Surprisingly, I didn't get any ice cream but went with the Ham & Brie Sandwich while Michelle went with the Grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese was maple smoked cheddar, double cream brie, jalapeno jack, capicollo and fig chutney.  She subbed the jalapeno jack for another less spicy sauce.  My ham & brie was simple, ham, double cream brie, mustard and mayo.  I also went with a small side of mac and cheese.  The girl prepared everything quite fast and it was nice and hot to bite.  I had a taste of Michelle's grilled cheese and boy was it spicy!  I'm a baby and I feel it was too spicy for me and it wasn't THAT spicy.  If you like a little heat, definitely go with the grilled cheese, otherwise..meh!  My sandwich was simple yet delicious!  The bread is toasted so it has a nice crunch as well as a softness.  There was a touch too much mayo as it was squishing out but overall it was really tasty.  The mac and cheese was really peppery so I put some ketchup on top which made it better.  The mac and cheese is creamy and rich so ketchup calms it down a bit.  They offer some pepperoni sticks, beef jerky and other meats to take home as well.  What caught my eye was the HUGE PICKLES in the jar for $1.50!   CHACHI's is a great place to have a quick bite that doesn't taste like food court food.  I would say it's a 'higher end' food court food!  Next time I will order a pickle and finish off with a fiasco gelato ice cream sandwich!!!! :)"}
{"text":"It's a good thing the buns are decent, because the sandwiches are 90% bread. So overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Sooooo sad they got rid of ham.. and changed their menu. Drive 2.5 hours to get a ham sandwhich to find out they no longer have it."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen the picture that is hanging on Chachi's wall as you pass by on your way to Phil & Sebastian? The one of the ginormous sandwich stacked with like 6 inches of meat?  I have. Many times.  And I can't help thinking that THIS is what caused me to be so disappointed by Chachi's once I finally tried it.  That picture used to entice me.  I used to think, \"Woah. If that picture is hanging on their wall, it's GOTS to be awesome!\"   Stacks of meat!  That's what I expected! And what did I receive? ... a not-much-better-than-Subway sub with a disappointingly thin layer of meat for around $9.  Sorry Chachi, your false advertisement has left me with unrealistic expectaions and a stomach hungry for a HUGE stack of MEAT!!!"}
