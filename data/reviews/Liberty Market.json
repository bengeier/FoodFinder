{"text":"First time to the Market. It was ok. I would have rated this higher except for a couple of glitches. Wife & I shared the sausage pizza, roasted beet salad, I added a cup of minestrone and we had a couple of beers. The soup came out first, per my request. Good with a bit of pesto on top, just not hot enough. I would say it was lukewarm. The roasted beet salad was great. Nothing wrong there. I was surprised and frankly disappointed with the pizza. It looked great, tasted good, but the crust was soft. I was expecting a crust with a crunch, not the soft crust that I got. Maybe that is how the crust comes out of their oven, but with a 900 degree wood fired oven I have always gotten a crunch on the crust. 
P.S. Make sure your pizza cook wears his gloves when handling ready to eat food"}
{"text":"My mom and I split and shared the five alarm burger and the Cuban.....

The five alarm is no joke. I love jalepenos and spice but whoaaaa this one is on fire! 

The Cuban was AMAZING! Haven't had another like it! 
Over all great experience. A bit pricey but all in all worth it!"}
{"text":"Fabulous. I absolutely love this place. I have been going here for years, and I am never disappointed in my order. They are busy, so be prepared to wait in line for a few minutes. But it is well worth the wait. Love Liberty!"}
{"text":"Yum! A trendy joint in the old downtown area. The breakfast was amazing! The veggie scramble was made with goat cheese and very tasty. The cinnamon roll however was old and  looked like a huge dry crouton!"}
{"text":"I had been to Liberty Market before but it just didn't stick out to me.  

I preferred Joe's BBQ across the street. 
Well just this past week we ended up going to both Liberty Market and Joe's Farm Grill and all I can say is...\"Why didn't I come back to  both of them earlier?\"  

The staff was beyond pleasant.  Exceedingly nice and helpful.  When I got my meal it wasn't what I ordered (or so I thought) but they cheerfully brought me what I actually wanted and offered to package the incorrect food as well and didn't charge me the difference between the two items ($5).  The Pressed Rancher sandwich was great!  And of course my wife said to me that I had ordered the wrong thing to begin with.  

Our server delighted in telling us about their specials, his favorite foods and deserts.  A great experience."}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming from me.  Only having lived in the Gilbert area for about 9 years, I have been able to see much of the old town grow into a more upscale, urban vibe to it that sort of meshes well with the dusty, tumbleweed blowing across the street scene that it is.  Confusing and sort of awesome all in one, the little old street in Gilbert has become a place of choice not only for me, but throngs of east valley residents as well.  There are too many good places to eat in this area and this is a good problem.  
The review:
Liberty has been a place I have been ordering take-out from for over two years now and my actual dine-in experience has been minimal. Parking is reasonable though can at times be difficult with Postino's, Joe's, and Oregano's all smashed together.  Phone-in orders are always courteous, almost always fully accurate with special order types, and the wait has never been prolonged.  The restaurant is clean and just fun to look at.  
Food is delicious.  I have not sampled the entire menu but it is varied and well thought out.  Pricey?  Maybe.  I have learned that more imaginative and fresh food equals a more premium price and for the most part, I accept this.  
As a creature of habit, I can speak on the salmon blt with authority; never fishy, good char on the bun, bacon is always delicious, tomatoes are thick and red.  Sandwiches are clever with designer cheese and excellent breads.  Homemade kettle-styled chips = yum!  
Breakfast is also varied and delicious.  
Coffee bar:  This is my favorite region of  Liberty.  I have shed the Starbucks addiction and moved to more local coffee houses that can replicate a good cappuccino.  Liberty can do this to my satisfaction.  The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly.  They will remember your order and chat with you if not too busy.  Adult coffee drinks?  Sign me up.  
I love this place.  I want to move in to this place.  I dislike people.  Herein lies the problem.  The times I can visit are always peak when there are throngs of 
obnoxious humans and the acoustics are terrible.  Navigating the Yukon models of strollers to a table is an exercise in patience and contortion; space between tables is at a premium.  
Is this a place to quietly work on your laptop with a cup of coffee? Depends on the time.  Is this a place to get an excellent coffee drink?  Yes.  Food is delicious and the atmosphere is engaging.  
Pros:  Food and coffee drinks; decor and yes, bathrooms have character.
Cons:  (Peak hours) Parking, too much humanity in one establishment, acoustics.  
  
The Joe's chain has another winner."}
{"text":"I could write paragraphs and poems about how much I love this place! I could eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I have never been dissapointed with anything I have ordered here. My favorites: for breakfast their chai tea, Vietnamese coffee, there biscuits and gravy and bacon pancakes. For lunch, their picnic sandwich with the sweet potatoe side. For dinner, the salmon blt. The salmon blt is a must try!!"}
{"text":"I could not have asked for a better meal. I went there last night with my best friend. We got there about 7:30pm on a Saturday night and it was packed!!!! They handled the crowds amazingly and made it feel like we were the only people in there. I was so amazed how organized they are. 

The food was delicious! I got the picnic salad and devoured the entire thing. I had a bite of my friend's sweet potato salad. SOOOO GOOD!!! I can't wait to go back and try something else!

Be sure to stop in the bathrooms. So original."}
{"text":"Wow! I originally came here for breakfast and enjoyed it (they offer tea in a separate pot, and that's always a good sign) so I recommended it for our \"weekly dinner with in-laws\". This is always a challenge, with many dietary restrictions and limited palates. But everyone loved it, the food was outstanding as was the service. The only drawback is the \"seat after you've ordered\" policy. Fortunately, we got there just before the crowds really started to roll in. Friday night is pretty popular. 

I had their margarita pizza, which to me is always about the sauce. And the sauce did not disappoint. My husband had the flank steak and subbed out the cauliflower for the mashed potatoes. I'm not a meat eater, so I'll have to trust him when he said it was delicious. But if the cauliflower side is any indication, it was amazing. My inlaws got the salmon special and the BLT (traditional) respectively. Both were very very happy. 

After our dinner, one of the many wait staff took our order for dessert (so we didn't need to get back in line) and we both enjoyed the treats. My father-in-law had a cookie that made him very happy and I had their special avocado mint chocolate chip ice cream. Extra creamy and yummy. It made the thin mint on top taste flat and boring. 

Supper happy with our experience, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"5 Star service!

Great food for a dozen people. Walk up to counter and order. They bring your food to you wheather you eat inside or out. 

We sat outside for lunch. We were trying to put tables together with umbrellas for our group. We presume one of the managers came out and started moving a table without an umbrella, took the umbrella off another, moved it in place, replaced umbrella, continues adjusting all of them so we'd all be protected from the heat. She continued \"waiting\" on us even though it's not expected at this type of place. Completely 5 star service! One of the moms told their daughter to go get a cup to go. The same employee overheard and went inside and brought several cups out to us.

I needed a lid, went inside and another employee went to two different locations to happily get me one. Thanks To these sweet, caring, kind employees for making my nieces birthday special!"}
{"text":"We go here every week and just love it.  Food is excellent.  People are super friendly.  You feel good just hanging out there.  The only complaint is because it is so good, the line is long and it just takes a bit too much time if you came later in the day."}
{"text":"The customer service here is awesome! The sandwiches and hamburgers are awesome. I like that there is rice pudding available amongst the other delicious cold case items. Here's my problem...the breakfast blows. Now I have tried breakfast items here more than once so this review is not based on a one time experience. I have not been impressed with the breakfast other than the biscuit. It's very average and super pricey for the portion you end up receiving. There coffee bar is also pretty pricey for what you end up receiving. The only thing I don't mind paying for other than the hot tea service is the hot chocolate because it's very delish and comes in a bowl."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our family favorites. We've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Today I had the Philly cheese steak burger - that's right...the perfect fusion of a Philly Cheese steak with a juicy, perfectly cooked burger. We all split the Bread pudding for dessert - simply amazing. And don't forget a cortado  for the perfect caffeinated beverage."}
{"text":"I have once again managed to eat at Liberty twice in one day.  I love how the weekends serve breakfast late so when I skip breakfast for Yoga class I can still get my egg fix.  And oh did I.  Love the American scramble and the trick is to ask for a side of gravy for that delicious biscuit.  

However it was my dinner experience that inspired me to write an updated review.  A few firsts, sat at the coffee bar and was served table side--very nice.  Had the salmon special with a potato cake and mustard sauce which was awesome, love their specials.  However it was the post meal coffee that was life changing.  I am quite the coffee snob and am rather picky about where and how I have coffee.  Last night I wanted a little something sweet (the chocolate truffle cookie) and a small shot of espresso.  I was first going to ask for the Cubano but the Barista suggested the Cortadito.  WOW!  That little cup of goodness had escaped my radar but now I can't stop thinking about it.  So rich and lightly sweet with a nice foam. I know that it has dairy in it, steamed half and half I believe so nothing but the best of dairy, but for me it is just a small amount so I am willing to suffer the consequences and take an extra sinus pill."}
{"text":"Finally, we tried this nice, cozy restaurant. The Flat Iron Steak is super, and their Far Eastern Salad is also delicious.
After dining, you can walk to the famous Water Park Plaza, Gilbert's trademark ;o)"}
{"text":"I've never been to Liberty Market for dinner, though their dinner menu always looks amazing, but I have enjoyed many a breakfast/brunch/lunch there.  It is the type of restaurant where you place your order at a counter, find a place to sit, and then they bring your food to you.  They can get quite busy during peak meal times, but they are efficient at finding open tables for you, so you're never wandering around looking for a table after you've ordered.

They are locally-owned and use a lot of fresh, locally grown ingredients, so that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I eat there.  Pizzas, salads, and sandwiches are all delicious, but what deserves an extra special shout out is the dessert case.  The gigantic cinnamon roll is perfection.

Can't think of enough good things to say; just go check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I wish I could give these guys 4.75 stars! I love the architecture, the vibe, and decor. The brick wall, the open ceiling, the spread of all their delicious food; I just want to hang out there. The food . . . BANGARANG . . . the food! It is exceptional! The price point is set exactly right for the quality and quantity of food. I have eaten nearly everything on the menu and it is all fantastic! Their chicken sandwich is called \"The Best Chicken Sandwich\". It's clear why they called it that. The grilled sausage pizza that they make fresh, rolling and tossing the dough right in fornt of you, while then cooking it in an open brick oven with grilled onions, ricotta, and locally made arizona sweet Italian sausage - also BANGARANG! The only thing stopping me from giving a full 5 stars was the cashier my last time there seemed a bit grumpy. It happens . . . but I save my 5's for perfection. 

However, Liberty Market is as close to perfect as possible!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since my first review, so I thought I'd drop a quick line and let you know that Liberty Market is a good place.  The owners are awesome and caring - and the staff (called \"the brigade\") and really nice, too.

Food portions are beyond generous.  Prices as low as $1.66 for an espresso or you can get a full sized, All American breakfast for $8.00.   

The environment is welcoming and great for groups. No stress or worries about being rushed out.  

Just an overall really nice \"third place\""}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  The waiter stuck his thumb  in our ketchup and then tried to hide it.  Our togo order was brought out at the same time as our food.  After receiving our food we were forgotten about.  Our plates filled the table.  My son had to go to the front counter to ask for the dessert we ordered.  I regrettably gave a 20% tip as I paid for the food at the counter before we sat down.  

As for the food it was ok but expensive.  I was happy with my hamburger however  I paid $2 extra for the roasted potatoes which were good...but i only had about 7 fries on my plate.  We also shared a piece of the carrot cake and i do not recommend it.  The champagne macaroons were ok but not worth $3 for such a small portion."}
{"text":"Terrible chef...very disrespectful.. Telling all friends and Facebook followers never to eat there..ruined my AZ vacation"}
{"text":"I've never had tums before but the 6 Alarm burger with jalapeños and habanero aioli turned my b hole into Mt Vesuvius with hot lava pouring out while I screamed bloody murder on the toilet for at least an hour. Great burger great place would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, busy on a sunday afternoon, but they handled the crowd well. I ordered the rancher sandwhich, with the pasta salad, red velvet cake, and a stone pale ale. Sandwich was awesome, everything was real fresh and lots of flavor. Can't wait to go back so much on the menu I want to try. Breakfast menu looks amazing."}
{"text":"It doesn't require many words to say how impressed I am with this place... flawless food, delicious espresso, friendliest staff of anywhere I've ever been, and always consistent in what they do. Beautiful atmosphere and decor, wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \"three amigos\" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalapeño. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place after hearing all the buzz and reading the great reviews. However, it sounds like this is a better breakfast place. I had a half order of Cesar salad and added chicken, plus an iced tea. For $14, I can get a much better salad and tea. Granted it was a half portion, but it was still quite small. Also, the dressing tasted like pure anchovies and for an up charge of $5, I expected there to be more chicken. The service was great and the atmosphere cute, which gets 3 stars, but I found the menu boring and the food mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is ok... a little pricey for what you get. Lines are long but move quickly. Food is delivered in a timely manner. This place is better for breakfast or lunch over dinner in my opinion."}
{"text":"Gilbert is shaping up to be quite a hip little downtown and Liberty Market is the reason. It will be nice to have Postino there when it finally opens too. You have to thank Joe Johnson for bringing us this authentic little gem. It's nice to know that this part of town can indulge in a nice little f&b experience too. Thank you JOE! Now bring it to Chandler, we are dying for something in the neighborhood. Hint...hint. Ocotillo/price area overlooking the farm land and Indian Reservation....sunset, etc. 

Oh, and the food is fresh, amazing and creative. Whoot!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for dinner. small-ish menu but have always liked what I got. you order at the cashiers and then seat yourself and the food gets delivered. free dessert on your birthday!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  Fresh and always well-prepared salads and sandwiches.  Not your typical Gilbert sandwich shop.  Love it and return often."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! will always be going back for the dinner! Thank you Liberty Market for our date night!"}
{"text":"They have a great margarita pizza and a great burger!  I think this is the best of all of Joe's assorted restaurants."}
{"text":"I love eating in down town Gilbert because it is so cute and Liberty Market is no exception. The line to order can be daunting, especially during the lunch rush but the food is definitely worth it.  My bf and I split the special, it was a pizza with prosciutto, figs and fresh mint and it was AMAZING. We also had the lump crab cake- which was delicious, but a bit small, perfect since we split the pizza but it would not suffice alone as a meal. We then had the \"pie of the day\" for dessert which was a raspberry cream pie/cheese cake thing and was lovely"}
{"text":"One of my fav places in the entire valley! Food is really good and coffee is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. The food is just OK. I do like their coffee a lot and it's a hip joint. They do have a pretty good pastry selection and everything I've had is delic. I'm just not impressed with the food. You may think differently though so give them a shot. Expect a long line."}
{"text":"I've been to Liberty Market many times and I love their food.  However, the reason for my bad review is because they were so unaccommodating and rude.  A dear friend of mine was just diagnosed with breast cancer, it has been a whirlwind of tests and procedures since her diagnosis.  We just found out she is going to start chemo this current week, so I thought it would be nice to have a get together with her friends and family and throw her a \"hat, wig, scarf get together\" to show our support for her.  Last week, I called Liberty Market and explained the situation to the manager on staff and she was very rude.  She just said they don't take reservations at all and that I would need to email the owner.  I apologized for the last minute notice but explained that everything has been happening so quickly, we were just notified chemo was starting early the following week.  I asked what the turn around time was to hear back from the owner because it was about 4 days prior to the event so I needed to get it organized, and she just said she didn't know.  I understand not being able to take reservations but she didn't have to be rude.  She could have help provided options we were bringing 20-30 people to the establishment.  As much as I like their food I will not be going there again.  After this rude interaction I called The Original Chop Shop in Chandler and they also do not take reservations, but were willing to help us out and make sure they had enough employees staffed and seats available to accommodate us.  I truly appreciated their help!  Liberty Market employees need to have sensitivity training! Have a heart!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant with a lot of healthy and hearty options in a relaxed environment. It's more of a lunch spot because you make your order at the counter they give you a number then they drop off food. But they have hearty and delicious dinner options like last time I was there they had seabass. The chorizo cheese sauce was delicious. The salmon BLT is a winner. 

The decoration are very eclectic."}
{"text":"I'm going to say this in the nicest way possible ... Don't get an iced coffee here if your used to them from Starbucks and any other place that slaps together some syrup and milk and charges you 5 bucks for it.  The Ice Latte with Vanilla I had at lunch today pretty much ruined me.  I'm intending to go back and learn more of their menu, but that was really all I needed to get through the day and I think every day after this one will be pretty dull and boring without it."}
{"text":"I recently started working in the area and I decided to try Liberty a couple weeks ago. I'm very happy with the service I got from James who was friendly despite the early morning! I ordered the Vietnamese Coffee and their signature potatoes. I can't believe I didn't use any condiments! The flavor was great and the coffee was strong but still very tasty. Although sometimes a little busy in the mornings and on weekends, I'll comeback here anytime and have already been 3 times since then. Great place!! I love my new \"early\" spot:)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for breakfast.  Go early so you can be seated promptly.  They assign your table as you are waiting in line to order.  I actually think they have a great system and don't mind having to wait.  Blueberry scones are sooo good, portions are extremely satisfactory, liberty potatoes are tasty, love their decaf, everything is delicious.  Nothing disappoints.  Have always had a great experience.  This place beats any other breakfast place on \"restaurant row\" in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. Awesome Pizzas, decent sandwiches and very enjoyable and friendly servers. Especially the blonde girl working the coffee counter with freckles.

We will be back and consider us new regulars."}
{"text":"Really it should be 2.5 stars, but I'll round up. So this place was ok. The food is certainly better than their drinks. I got a Moscow mule and it didn't really taste like one. It tasted like they used ginger ale (not the alcoholic kind) in stead of ginger beer. Aside from the awful drinks, he food was good. I got the the salmon BLT, which was raved about. We get better salmon in Salt Lake I assume, it didn't taste too fresh. I think that what this place had going for it was that I was hungry. We didn't get to try the coffee so hopefully they are better at that. I would give this place a better rating if the prices matched the quality. I suggest just walking across the street to Postino."}
{"text":"I've been to Liberty Market many of times now, it's just down the street from me and thought it was due time I gave my two cents. Joe did an outstanding job on designing this restaurant/coffee house. It's exactly what downtown Gilbert needed! There is even a funky little market at the entrance that sells nostalgic trinkets and local organic produce. It's the perfect place to shop if you are looking for something unusual. Oh and I have to mention I was so excited to see Dare cookies, a product I grew up with in Canada, on his shelves - they make the best Lemon cookies! If you've been to any of Joe's restaurants you're probably familiar with the cafeteria style ordering. I'd prefer sit down service but somehow this concept works well in all his establishments. 

All most all of Liberty Markets ingredients are locally grown and produced. The food is pretty decent, I have tried a few of the pizza's in the past and thought they were pretty tasty. I did however think the Salami pizza was a little too salty...I know I know it's Salami. My friends tried the 1/2 lb burger and raved about it for days. Personally, I would say the breakfast here rocks in comparison to lunch and dinner. So many unique choices on the menu, fresh pastries baked daily, and a variety of specialty coffees. What more could you want! 

This is a great place to sip on a latte and shoot the breeze with friends. Liberty Market is one of those places where you can go and feel at home. Joe, the owner, can be seen walking around talking with all the patrons...he never seems to forget a name or face. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Came here again with my wife on Sunday June 14.. We have eaten there before and I was just so-so on the food.. Well today I am a little more than pleased.. I had the Demi-Bfast again.. This time with the Turkey-Maple sausage.. The sausage is very good and flavorful..  My wife had the American bfast, the potatoes were very tasty today.. 

I ended up getting a Chocolate Truffle Cookie... WHOA. very chocoy and soft.. My wife had the Chocolate Chip cook loaded with chippies.. The owner Kierstan (sorry if I spelled it wrong, I gave you my business card-Jason L. Photography) was very nice, stopped by the table a couple times to ask how we were doing, if the food was good and just be nice!!

Now I overheard her (Kierstan)  asking another table if they had visited the bathrooms ( I was like hmmm that's and odd question).. Well EVERYONE must visit the bathrooms here.. I ended up in the Vespa bathroom.. There is a bathroom with recipes written on the walls, one that is mostly black & red, with pics of tattoos people... Just check them out!!

She was talking about the pizzas and suggested the \"white\" pizza next time. We will try this place for dinner I want to try a burger since she said her husband did the burgers over at DLUX in Phoenix..

. Anyone who reads this, WHY stand and wait for up to 1 hour at The Farmhouse next door? Their food is over priced and mainly average fare at best.. They would rather focus on volume than focus on quality.. Maybe they are 1 step above IHOP!!! Go next door to Liberty Market.. MUCH BETTER and less expensive!!"}
{"text":"Thanks again Yelp.  While staying in the area for a few days I tried the Liberty Market, based on the Yelp reviews, and they were right on.  Had a delicious wood fired oven pizza featuring Schreiner's Italian sausage, which I assume to be a local company.  It was fantastic, even the ricotta cheese, which I had been a bit leery of.  The rice pudding I had for dessert was spot-on also.  I also poached a couple of meatballs from someone's pasta plate and they were juicy, delicious and tender.  And I couldn't help but notice the pleasant and helpful staff.  Looking forward to a return trip to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My family dined at Liberty Market yesterday before attending the Christmas Carol. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive (my daughter spilled an entire glass of water on her and the staff was right there to help clean up and gave her dry towels to help soak up the water), and made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant (tho it was busy even at an off time). Not to mention that the food was excellent! We all ordered something different and were very pleased with our choices. The style of the restaurant was very cool too. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The restaurant is very crowded and has a unique seating arrangement but it works.  Apparently the bathroom is amazing enough to merit a visit in and of itself."}
{"text":"Love this place! The hubby and I are fans of businesses that stress local and/or organic fare. We have been very happy with the service and food quality every time we've visited. On our last visit, I inquired about the cordalitos on the espresso bar menu and we were given a complimentary order to try. If you order tea, you get an entire tea service complete with your own little teapot. A great place to try, and saves you from standing in line at The Farmhouse next door."}
{"text":"Unbelievably uninspiring breakfast. Chilaquiles was cold so I got the biscuits and gravy. Dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor. I have never posted a review on yelp but this meal was so bad I felt I had to. Nothing original on the breakfast menu..will not return."}
{"text":"Been going here quite a few times lately. Enjoyed every visit overall. The Maiden Lane?(turkey sandwich), Arizona Sky and Minestrone were all delicious. The sloppy joe could have been better. Too much bun and not enough slop.

The creamy potato salad was weak. Very bland and flavorless.On the other hand the roasted sweet potato salad was quite the opposite. Could not get enough of it. Was really disappointed the last time I went and they were sold out.

Staff has been nothing but great each visit."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere - A bit crowded at times making getting around (refills) a challenge. Overall  desserts are best, food is good, and service is average."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but can be over priced.  Very busy on the weekends and wait times can be high."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a fun place to enjoy whatever your heart desires. Burger and beer, coffee and pastries, wood-fired pizza and salad, weekend dinner specials and a glass of wine... must I continue!

Chef David crafts some of the most delicious dishes I have ever had. My wife and I love spending evenings at Liberty, showing it off to our friends and enjoying the whole nine yards. We start with an appetizer and drink, working our way into the weekend specials.  I've never had a weekend special that didn't make me drool, and must say they create the best seafood dishes I have had in the valley! We always finish with espresso drinks (hand-crafted on a 1965 Faema E61) and house made desserts! 


Red Velvet and Carrot Cake...Yes Please! Cappuccinos with Stumptown Espresso...enough said!! 

Liberty is great for everyone. It has a fantastic ambiance, and a friendly, hard-working staff!  

I will always be a fan of Liberty Market!"}
{"text":"We went to Liberty Market because the wait at Oregano's was too long.  I had heard many good things about this restaurant, so we gave it a go.

The atmosphere was very cool.  I felt as if I had been transported to a restaurant in a different city.  Everyone in our large group was comfortable at our table.  

The staff were very friendly and helpful.  We were told to place our order before the crowd came.  We looked around and didn't see many people.  I was amazed when a flood of people came into the restaurant and formed a line stretching to the back of the restaurant!  It was as if somebody rang a dinner bell in Gilbert.

The food was decent, but maybe it was just that I ordered the wrong items.  We shared a cobb salad and a pizza.  I will have to go back and try a few more items to form a better opinion."}
{"text":"The Molinari Pizza, the Sicilian Pan Pizza, The Picnic Sandwich, and (even though i missed it this time) the unbelievable Salt River Bar.  If you like Pomo, Pizzeria Bianco, or the like you will love the wood fired pizzas at Liberty Market.  Great concept, great food, and a very savvy menu.  I have full intentions of visiting this place as often as I can."}
{"text":"We have tried and tried to love, even like this place, but every time the food is just OK.  The cortaditos (coffee) are great and the staff is nice.  I really want to love their food, because I love Joe's Farm Grill.  I'm sure I'll try again because they do let us bring our puppy on the patio.

*** UPDATE***
I was so surprised to het an e-mail from Joe Johnston who wanted to know how he could make things better.  He sent us a small gift card so I had to give them one more chance.  SO, we were happy with our food.  I still am not a big fan of their egg selections but I had the smoked salmon platter and it was lovely.  We talked to the co-owner and told her we were giving it another chance and she was so sincere and sweet.  Bottom line - we've been back twice and will probably continue, especially while the weather is so nice and we can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"D-E-L-I-S-H! This place is yummylicious for sure! We went for a charity they were a part of and I had never been there but always wanted to try it. The food was absolutely PERFECT! and the prices were decent! My food was sooo good. I wanted to try everyone else's plate. We all ended up sharing everything! From the appetizers to the meal, the side dish and dessert...we weren't disappointed with a single thing! And the best part is they grow their own food or get it from local farmers right here in Arizona!  

Aside from the food the staff was super AWESOME. They were all nice and accommodated us perfectly! The place is a little crowded, the line is a little long, and it's kind of loud inside but these are all GOOD things not bad! Go in and you will see why I say that! :o)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, hands down. Good food, fun atmosphere and friendly staff. Amazing breakfast, lunch and dinner. The egg salad sandwich is always my go-to and the huge slice of red velvet cake is heavenly."}
{"text":"Had the Smothered Breakfast Burrito, wait staff was very friendly, it was excellent food. Liberty Market is always a great bet for superior food."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurant owned by Joe BBQ grill across the street. The presentation of each dish is well done. Also, there are variety of menu and easy to choose. It's not the fancy place where you take the minutes to choose your dish. The restaurant works as the combination of fast food and restaurant. 

The price is little high for what they out in front of you, but the taste is pretty decent. I had salmon sandwiche and Margarita pizza. Pizza is outstanding. However it is not the shareable size so you may need at least two if you are trying to fill you up with two people. 

Another unique thing about this place is the coffee shot they serve. I am not the heavy codify drinker but I like the espresso shot which they have. If you are looking for something refresh after the meal, I would highly recommend this place even after your meal somewhere near by. The restaurant crews are very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is amazing everytime! Service is always great! Prices are higher than I usually like to spend for lunch but worth it!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and ridiculous set up. Rude staff thst make you feel like an inconvenience.  Older gentleman maybe owner, is very helpful to select people. Im guessing regulars. Ive been in twice and been ignored by him while he bent over backward to people around me. Very rude experience today waiting for takeout. Sat by bar at large table. Jerk employee came over to seat some people and told me to get up and that the space was for customers. WTF. I just paid $16 for luke warm coffee and gross sandwich..plus there were other seats available right around me. GO next door to Farmhouse where food and staff are much better."}
{"text":"All my hip friends said to try this place. I'm always on the lookout for a great breakfast stop. Pancakes and eggs, man. If you can screw up pancakes and eggs, you are worthless.

They screw up pancakes and eggs, man.

Ordering was a breeze, if \"wait, where do I go, do I take a menu here, do I order from you?\" is a breeze. You pay at the counter before you sit. This is so they can ignore you once you're served, because, hey, you paid. I had scrambled eggs and a pancake with bacon for eight dollars. That's two eggs, one whole pancake, and a few limp pieces of bacon for EIGHT DOLLARS. Want a cup of tea? Add FOUR DOLLARS. Because, Gilbert, son!

The eggs were dried lumps lightly scattered on the plate. They tasted bland, and if that was two eggs, they were tiny mutant eggs. Tiny, shriveled, dried out mutant eggs. As mentioned, the bacon was limp, but it tasted like bacon, so gold star! When I got to the lone, average-sized pancake, I was pretty disgusted to find that while the outside was golden, the inside was, shrug, still batter. Wet, gooey batter. After waiting too long for my server to check on me, I got someone's attention and notified them about the batter abomination and asked for a replacement pancake. A few minutes later I got a rubbery burnt pancake. BUT! It was a rubbery burnt pancake with a mushy, just-this-side-of-batter middle. There was nothing \"cake\" about this pancake at all. I wanted to shout \"your griddle is TOO HOT!\" but instead I bought a cookie and left.

The cookie was delicious.

These people have no business doing breakfast. Will never return. Unless I need a cookie."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. They have great food, coffee, desserts and ambiance. They add pesto to their minestrone! Pesto makes everything better. Servers were very attentive. This is a great place for me to hang out while I do paperwork and make phone calls in between visits at work. I have also spent a very  long lunch here with girlfriends. We didn't feel rushed to leave by staff. Our lunch extended into early Friday evening. It did seem to get really busy closer to the dinner crowd. Patrons seemed to range from people on dates to people with small children. It's a great place for everyone."}
{"text":"A drizzling Sunday lunch brought everyone inside as it was packed.  We found the last small table by the windows and waited for our food which arrived quickly.

The Farmer sandwich had fresh vegetables and goat cheese.  I got the corn, tomato, and bean salad as a side with it.  The Vegetarian pizza had grilled zucchini, grilled asparagus, mushrooms, and olives.  Everything was cooked and prepared perfectly.

The shining star was definitely the bread pudding which they make out of their cinnamon rolls.

Very fresh and healthy food.  Great pastries."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY restaurant in Gilbert that's a MUST-VISIT.  There are many great restaurants in Gilbert (try Liberty's sister restaurants: Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's B-B-Q) but only Liberty offers outstanding variety, quality and commitment to excellence every time I visit (which is about once a week).  Over the past three years I've tried just about everything on their menu: burgers and sandwiches, salads, dinner entrees, pastries, pizza, appetizers - you name it.  There wasn't a single dish that I regretted trying.  Some I've liked more than others of course (the Cuban sandwich, the Apricot Glazed Chicken, the breakfast Chile Quiles!! are my three current favorites), but truly, everything I've tried I've liked.  The quality of the ingredients is top-notch, the presentation of the food, the super-friendly and professional staff, the quirky and tasteful decor (go check out the bathrooms - seriously, look in each stall)...this place has it all.  And if you have a food allergy or are just extra conscious about what you put in your body (as we all should be), Liberty Market has tons of substitutions and additions for you!  From GF, to soy-free, to dairy-free to vegan and vegetarian - if you're not sure you can eat something on the menu but you'd LIKE to try it - usually the staff is willing to work with you!  I can't say enough good things about this place - go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"So today me and my girlfriend decided to go to liberty market and grab some sandwiches to go I ordered a chicken sandwich and she ordered a BLT bacon lettuce and tomato it turned out to be a child size sandwich with no meat barely any lettuce and one slice of tomato I was very unpleased and disatisfied for nine dollars if the sandwiches was 4 dollars it would be totally explainable,I can't recommend this over priced lunch to anyone since there are so many nearby resteraunts in old town Gilbert.. Liberty & Justice for all"}
{"text":"The wait was only fifteen minutes to be seated early Friday dinner time. The acoustics are awful forcing everybody to speak very loudly. That being said, we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. The salmon BLT was tasty. The atmosphere was fun. We will return."}
{"text":"the wood fired pizza is excellent! I can't wait to eat here again. I also tried to grilled bread pudding for breakfast and it was excellent, the portions are large and you feel the need to eat it ALL because it is so delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places.  I keep having my favorites over and over again, need to branch out a bit more.  I love love love their sweet potatoe salad, but I do find that sometimes it's better than other times.  Last time I had it it was a bit on the salty side...still I ate every last bit.  My favorites are the italian pressed sandwich and their caprese sandwich.  Their bread is amazing.   Never had breakfast there.  I admit I am a bit addicted to this place..."}
{"text":"It is good- but not great!  I will go back, but have other favorites in the area that I love.  I have to be fair though, I have only tried a couple of the items.  I just don't like how you have to wait for a table when there are open tables out there.  I teetered between a 3 and a 4 star rating"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great Service. Very Friendly staff a great place to go to. We ate breakfast here the other day and totally enjoyed it. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  We came here specifically because of reading reviews.  Not exactly sure what the hype about this place.  Don't get me wrong, the food was completly and totally average for this style of sit down place.  One of our sandwiches the meat was a little dry and they went completly overboard with the horseradish (sandwich called \"the rancher\"). The sloppy joe was good, but nothing I would come out of my way to come get.   If you were to take my advise, go across the street to Joes Real BBQ"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Gilbert. 

Lines can be long during lunch or dinner but the wait isn't as long as the line appears to be. The quality of the food is always good and I have yet to be disappointed. Service is great as well. 

Recommend: Bread pudding french toast, pizza & the farmer sandwich. 

I would like to see the menu update every once in a while, but beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"i really like this place.  i have only been there for breakfast.  they have a cute little market in the front.  great for bread mixes and what nots.  great outside seating.  really like the coffe bar.  it reminds me of something i would of have in napa CA."}
{"text":"The food was good. Tasted fresh. Had the \"best chicken\" sandwich; so it was good, buuuut they smoother it in the avocado dressing and the vinaigrette so you look like a slob eating no matter how you attack it. The things I didn't like: 1.) the freaking wait in line and then for the food! DO NOT GO HERE if you need food in your belly right away! 2) it's so gotdayum loud that you cannot hold a conversation without the people that are 7 inches away from you, which leads me to...3) I hate sitting so damn close to complete strangers especially the group that was here tonight. Uppity, better than you attitude. Everyone was visited by the chef or some sever EXCEPT US! The only time we were visited was 20 minutes AFTER I put my napkin over my food in hopes some employee would get that I needed them(there was no way I was going to leave that pricey of a meal to be tossed). 
The experience really made me not a fan--eh"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Sometimes, i even love it. 4.5 stars is really the right one for this spot.   Been here 10+ times. 

 I'm cool with the ordering arrangement:  stand in line, order at cashier, find your own seat(s) and they bring you the food.  (I can see some people hate that...maybe they prefer sitting outside of Outback for 45 minutes holding a pager)

Good vibe inside.  great location.  Breakfast before the farmers market, or dinner before a play at the playhouse.  

Breakfast Favorites:  Biscuits & Gravy, Chilaquiles (haven't tried with the green chile pork yet, but i will).  Chorizo quesadilla is great.

Dinner:  pizzas, burgers, salads.  i've been happy with all of them.  

partially Rotating Menu:  weekly Burgers specials are awesome.  Pizza of the week options."}
{"text":"Last time we were in Gilbert we stopped in for lunch.  Wow, we couldn't believe the LONG line.  We decided to still give it a try.  Forty-five minutes later we were seated at our table enjoying our lunch.  My husband ordered their special hamburger made for the Chinese New Year.  It was a fantastic blend of Asian flavors and the burger itself was super moist and tender.  He was a huge fan!  I also had a few bites and I was as well.  I ordered the steak sandwich which was also very good, but not as good as his burger.  We also ordered the sweet potato salad and LOVED it.  It was the best I have ever had.  Great place to eat  but go early or late to beat the huge crowds.  Also great indoor and patio seating."}
{"text":"I have been recommended to try this place out many times, and I finally did yesterday. The special of the day was the Bison Burger, which ran about $13 after taxes. The burger itself was a bit expensive, and for the price I paid it didn't fill me all the way. 

I had my meat done medium, but if I ever do get it again, I'd go for the medium-rare because it would probably be way juicier and tastier. They even let you go rare if you like all that lovely blood.

I went with 2 of my girlfriends. One of them ordered the pizza, which tasted really delicious. It was different from the typical pizza because it tasted like lasagna! My other friend ordered the Italian sandwich. The taste was not as great as it sounded. It ran a little bland. 

For dessert, my friend ordered the bread pudding. It was a bit drier than all of the other bread puddings I've tried at other restaurants. The cream on this was very delicious and covered in cinnamon and nutmeg. I'd really recommend this dessert.

Overall, great place to go with friends to sit, chat, and catch up with life. The layout is very cute and warm. Also, if you get the chance, visit the restroom!! This is one of the cutest restroom layouts I've seen in a restaurant. Each stall has its own theme!"}
{"text":"The interior is very industrial and charming; furnished with iron beams, brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs. The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets. There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because you're distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display. I've never had a meal that wasn't awesome here. I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a home-made snicker-doodle. Whatever you end up ordering, I'm sure you'll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do!"}
{"text":"dear desert's and everything they make is quit orgasmic... lol this oatmeal cream pie...flawless!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what on Earth all these positive reviewers are smoking, but this was hands down one of the WORST breakfast experiences I have ever had.

Enticed by the glowing reviews and a perusal of their menu, we were excited to try a spot in our new neck of the woods.  Encouraged by the well-executed, old-fashioned but new interior, we made our way to the counter.  I was discouraged by not being to sit and look at the menu--it's 7:30am on a Saturday, I have not had any coffee, I'm hungry--but you want me to make a decision in a timely manner so as not to slow up other patrons?  Um...kay.

The offerings SOUNDED good and the pastries in the counter LOOKED good...

We're greeted by a \"hostess\" who gives us a laminated card with a number on it.  She explains that we are to give that card to the cashier who takes our order while she takes another card with the corresponding number and places it on a table somewhere in the dining room.  Once we have placed our order we are to proceed to the assigned table.  Got it?  Um...kay.

I ordered the Demi-Breakfast (two-scrambled eggs, bacon, and biscuit) and Husband ordered the Green Chili Pork Scramble w/ \"Liberty potatoes.\"  We are given two tiny coffee mugs (literally the FÄRGRIK mugs from IKEA that have practically no handle) and told that coffee is available at a self-service bar on one end of the dining room.  So now I have to get my own coffee and refill it as needed (which will be at least six times for me) by traversing the entire dining room with a mug of hot liquid that has, for all intents and purposes, no handle?  Um...kay. 

We then go to find our assigned table which is of course nowhere to be found.  The dining room is less than half-full, so we find a four-top near the coffee bar as I am going to need multiple trips there.  The \"hostess\" comes over to us and says in the snottiest of tones, \"This is actually RESERVED for a party of four, but I GUESS you can sit here\" and walks away to retrieve our table number from whatever hidden corner of the world she hid it. Wow.  Um...kay.

I'm already not enjoying my coffee when our food is delivered.  I shouldn't have even taken a bite, but I was starving so a nibbled at the emaciated, bulk-food style bacon that was really an insult to the animal who gave its life to be bacon.  Husband's pork \"chili\" was clearly prepared and seasoned by someone who has never had Pork Green Chili.  Maybe they used green bell peppers by mistake because it was utterly flavorless.  His \"Liberty\" potatoes were definitely frozen only a few hours before our arrival, mushy, grainy, and terrible.  Again, starving, I pressed my fork into my eggs to cut off a piece and behold!  A thick, black hair lay nestled among the eggs.

While the manager did refund our entire ticket, she offered to send us away with take out.  Um...no."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!!! Whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner or just coffee and dessert...everything we have tried here were amazing.  The cortado is my favorite coffee...the best I have tried!  I can't remember the name but the Chocolate death cake was amazing, the griddled bread pudding is something you have never had before that is just delicous!  We recently dined during the AZ restaurant week and for $33, it was the best deal and wonderful 3 course meal that includes a glass of wine...we actually came back and ate there again during the restaurant week.  To top it off, everyone is so nice and you just feel like you're at home! Amazing people and delectable dishes!"}
{"text":"After anxiously waiting several weeks to try this restaurant, I was not that impressed with meal. $39.35 for two people for breakfast...Holy Cow! We ordered:
- Bacon Pancakes
- Liberty Potatoes
- Side of Eggs
- Side of Sausage
- Griddled Bread Pudding
- Kir Royale 

Pro's:
- Appreciated the ability to order my food before sitting down
- You can see the chef's prepare the food in the open
- Bacon Pancakes were awesome! Loaded with plenty pig! 
- Liberty Potatoes were well seasoned and on point!
- Sausage was acceptable; not too salty, which I prefer

Cons:
- Major attitude was given when I POLITELY advised that my glass had apparent lipstick of sorts and NOT from my lips. The person tending the E61 Bar suggested that it wasn't ..... I DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT IT IS, MY GLASS IS APPARENTLY DIRTY! The manager was not all that pleased that I brought it up either, but so what! I just paid $40 and expect stellar service and clean tableware.
- Potatoes, eggs and sausage were brought out several mins before the main dish....uh, I prefer my entire meal at once and not in courses. 
- Griddled Bread Pudding was a bit soggy for my liking. 
- Kir Royale IMMEDIATELY gave me a headache; clear sign of cheap alcohol
- The line was a tad bit long to place an order. I would expect if you're standing in line to order and pay that it would move along much quicker than 25 mins.

While the menu had several items I would love to try, it will be quite a while before I revisit. I never place a dollar amount on a good meal however, I do prefer to get what I pay for. This was NOT a $40 breakfast!"}
{"text":"Everything is great here! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, and dessert.  The staff is always very friendly and attentive with lots of seating options.  It makes me happy to see a place consistently busy in downtown Gilbert. 

But most importantly....the Salt River Bar is life changing!!"}
{"text":"Really cool vibe and excellent food. Very noisy when busy but we have 2 small kids so we appreciate that. Everyone in our party really enjoyed their food but the star of the table was the apricots chicken my Dad got. Sauce was amazing.... so good in fact that my step mom emailed them for the recipe when she was back home in NC and to her surprise they sent it to her.

The desserts we got Togo were not as good as they looked but huge portions for price.
I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Most of the dishes i've tried have been on point! My only advice would be DO NOT order the tofu scramble breakfast option, i've had a fair number of tofu scrambles but sadly this is by far the worst! Mushy/watery, 0 flavor, I really don't think any additional spices were added. All the other options are amazing though, I recommend the demi-breakfast. Also the line is often to or out the door with only 1 person working the register, and you have to stare at all those delicious wood fired pies and desserts while you wait... but at least you'll be certain of what you want by then:) Try the specials!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are surprisingly different & very good. Liberty Market uses fresh, high quality ingredients. Liberty Market is similar to (and reminds me of) many of the unique & exceptional restaurants in the Arcadia & Biltmore areas. I've passed through downtown Gilbert many times & barely realized how many excellent restaurants are present there."}
{"text":"Liberty Market has some great food and some okay food choices. The cortado drink is the BOMB."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for the first time.  After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here.  We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market.  I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.

As we walked in we noticed that there was a line in which you stand to order your food at a counter.  We joined the line and read the menu.  Already having decided on a margherita pizza, we also chose the caprese salad and I knew I wanted a glass of pinot noir.  As we stood, I noticed that there were very few empty tables and I mentioned to my friend that maybe I should snag a table.  I had my eye on one table but as I walked toward it someone else apparently also had their eye on it and sat there first.  I bolted over to the only other empty table that I saw.  I sat for several minutes, watching my friend inch his way up to the counter.  A manager lady came over to me and asked me if I had someone standing in line.  I said yes.  She informed me that they usually like people to all wait in line and then order before sitting at a table.  I looked back at her and thought about the fact that there were no empty tables.  I said okay, but I held on to my table.  So that part was a little stressful.  The couple next to me joked around saying that I wasn't following the rules and may end up getting kicked out of my table.  Thankfully my friend was finally able to order and made his way over to our table.

We sat close to several other tables which seemd to invite conversation from all sides.  We chatted with all the people around us which was fun.

Our food came and it was delicious!  The pizza was perfectly cruncy and chewy.  The caprese salad was very tasty.  We devoured every last bite.

On our way out we were lucky to see Joe, the owner, and were able to compliment him on his wonderful restaurant.  I'll definitely be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I've been to Liberty market several times and always recommend it to friends.  Everything I've tried here has been very good.  Their service is organized and great.  Sometimes you might see Joe, the owner walking around and talking to people.  Of the three restaurants of Joe's (Liberty, Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Barbeque), Liberty Market is my favorite.

Random, but take a trip to the bathroom - they are very innovative and cool. 

There is also lots of fresh produce and supplies that you can buy."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert has become a dining delight, and Liberty Market is part of the reason why. With Postino East and Joy Ride being added to the Liberty Market and Joe's BBQ mix, along with others, there are a lot
of great choices, and Liberty is still King of the Hill. 

Try the burger of the week, whatever it is. Or if it seems too strange, the Tower burger never disappoints. Salads are fantastic, fish (changes with market) has been excellent every time we have tried it, and the pasta dishes are terrific. Save room for a dessert, even if you have to share. We wish they still had the original bread pudding, but we've managed to find wonderful substitutes. 

BTW, breakfast here is equally delightful. 

And what holds the whole thing together is the consistently excellent staff. Friendly, knowledgeable, genuinely glad to see you and to serve you, and happy to help make your dining experience a great one. (I'd name names, but Liz might be embarrassed so I'll leave that alone.)"}
{"text":"This place was great. We went in after seeing the reviews. It was a little.confusing at first with order your meal from the cashier with a paper menu. We ordered the hummus, flatiron steak, picnic salad and the zebra brownie. The steak was cook right at what I ordered, medium rare. My wife's salad was fresh and the zebra brownie was delicious. I intend to go there again and try them for lunch."}
{"text":"I would actually rate this place a high 3, like a 3.8! The food is really tasty and I would say the breakfest chilaquiles are dang near perfect in my book along with the bread pudding, and chicken pasta. 


However, the seating can be really close and uncomfortable. The dining room is incredibly cramped and if you happen to get a seat in the half table/half booth area you most likely will not be able to get up for refills or to use the bathroom if you happen to be in the booth part. I mean I guess it could be done but the people next to you will get awkwardly close to your crotch or butt, like in a plane. But, I don't want to do that if I have say a hot coffee in my hand.  Also, I don't mind the waiting in line to order aspect but I have been there a few times where they got so busy they stopped taking orders but failed to mention this to people still in line. I feel like you need to tell your customers if it happens. And, the final thing that I don't like as much is the sandwiches. I have gotten a few and they have really chaffed my upper gums because the bread was insanely tough and gritty. 


Overall, I would recommend this place. If you get the right thing the food is amazing. Just be sure you go on an off hour so you don't get trapped and maybe don't get the toasted sandwiches."}
{"text":"WITHOUT QUESTION a five star eatery.  We came Sunday evening for dinner & enjoyed eating on the patio. Order, sit down & food is brought out to you, very casual. 

Deli type selection with burgers & pizzas.  We tried the Tower Burger, 1/2 lb & comes w/pineapple chutney, Excellent!  Plus the Caprese Sandwich, a big serving, served on a very crispy delicious bread.

Also had the sweet potato salad w/cranberries & pecans was delish! Fruit Salad & Caprese Pasta Salad was delightful as well.

Finished our meal off with an Oatmeal Cream Pie & Berry Lemon Bar... OCP cookies were so moist and soft. The BLB was tangy!

Staff is very friendly & happy.

MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better than coming by with the buds and getting a good bite ! It is generally  busy so make sure you get there early."}
{"text":"First of all they serve Stumptown coffee. Winner winner. Had breakfast (The American Standard is what I ordered) and it was pretty average.  Seemed like they had a great selection of pastries. Steady flow of people. Great patio area, bar seating and regular seating for options on your time. Friendly staff and very nice environment.

I dig it!"}
{"text":"While I was living in the far East Valley, the Monkey and I frequented Liberty Market on a regular basis. I have to say that the EV has an over abundance of chain restaurants, which LM is definitely not. Their breakfast choices are hearty and well proportioned and not your run of the mill choices. Although I am a meat eater, the Vegetable Scramble with biscuit and potatoes made me happy and didnt make me miss the breakfast pig at all. And the griddled bread pudding is scrumptious, but wasnt a big enough portion compared to their other choices. The coffee bar is a treat but even I must admit that the bowl of latte is even a little much for me.

I've only been to LM a couple of times for lunch or dinner and really cant recall any favorites there, except for the side dishes. Those are all exceptional. I've even purchased the Sweet Potato Salad to go to serve at a company potluck.

The one downfall for me at LM, and really of any EV dining establishment (which seems to be the case in the EV moreso than in other parts of the Valley), is that it is definitely frequented by all family members. I'm only 40, but I grew up thinking going to McDonalds was a special treat and mom & dad were never afraid to hire a babysitter when they dined out or we all just stayed home. I realize this isnt going to win me any brownie points with those who have pro-created , but I wish more parents would realize that not everyone enjoys little Johnny's slobber and shrieks and running around barefoot during an otherwise potentially enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"This place was off the hook and the staff was top notch!  We went in and couldn't decide what entree to choose, because everything looked so good but when talking to John, he recommended the meatball sandwich on panini bread which wasn't on the menu.  One of the best sandwiches I've had and the atmosphere was good.  Definitely gonna come back on my next visit"}
{"text":"Went this am for brunch 4 hubby's bday. I enjoyed the griddled bread pudding and my husband had biscuits gravy and we shared the potatoes. Everything was great except for that red velvet piece of cake we took to go.  Wouldn't order it again and almost think they need to modify it, then again I am a lover and huge fan of sprinkles red velvet cupcake which no one can beat.  Overall, I would def recommend and go back but just for the food.  P.S. their servings we good size portions and the burgers look amazing!"}
{"text":"$25 for two tasteless sandwiches. My hubby saw the segment on the news regarding this restaurant, read tons of reviews and was excited to try. We went for a late afternoon lunch. Hubby got the Tower Burger with cheese and potato salad. He ordered his burger medium, and it was well done. He liked the pickles, but burger had no flavor. Wasn't thrilled with his creamy potato salad either. 
I went with the Best Chicken Sandwich without cheese. The name needs to change as it was not good. The sandwich had plenty of tasteless avocado spread, onion, tomato and tasteless shredded iceberg lettuce. I even added all the pineapple salsa that came with my hubby's burger to my sandwich and still no flavor. I could occasionally taste the char on the bun and the chicken. The char taste stayed with me the rest of the day. 
Both sandwiches had more bun than protein. 
The chips were the best part of either meal!
We won't be fooled again!
We sat outside. At some point a female employee stopped by and asked how our meal was. We said it was not memorable, and she said she was sorry."}
{"text":"How this place has good reviews is incomprehensible to me! Went there for breakfast. 

Food: BAD! I had the Demi-breakfast with eggs, sausage, and pancakes. Everything was COLD. The eggs tasted fake not sure why maybe they were from the cartons of liquid eggs. The sausage was the plainest meat I have ever tasted. It really tasted like nothing. The pancakes reminded me of McDonalds' (not that I ever go there) except that at McDonald's they would have been hot! I couldn't believe how small the portions were considering they charged $7! My bf had the same problem of cold, bland food.

Service: BAD! Sat down at the table closest to the cash register to take a look at the menu and was told by one of the employees to move because the table sat four and we were only two. Considering the fact that it was Friday mid-morning and not many people were there we did not move. Instead we continued to look at the menu. She decided to bring a reserved sign and put it in the way of us. I thought it was so strange how rude this lady was until I later read another reviewer who said the same thing happened to them."}
{"text":"I really love visiting Liberty Market.  The food is always good and the sides are rotated so I seem to always try something new.  The first visit to LM I had the Maiden Lane and the slaw was delicious...as a side I had the sweet potato salad.  I have also had the vegeterian pizza that has asparagus and squash.  The pizza crust was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful wood fire taste.  The sangria is wonderful, full of fruit and goodies.  Also the carrot cake is something to have every trip.  So dence and moist.  I would eat at LM every day if I could afford it!  Love Love the Liberty Market."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is fabulous!!! From its locally - grown, fresh ingredients from Agritopia, to its weekly lunch and dinner specials, and amazing desserts, it is the BEST!! The staff is always super helpful and friendly and they always treat us like VIP's!!! With both indoor and outdoor seating, there are plenty of options for small to large groups. It is no wonder that this is one of my favorite places to eat!!"}
{"text":"I went here a while ago, but I LOVED it!  My pizza was AMAZING and the atmosphere was seriously so cute.  I had to wait in line for a while to order my food, but it was worth the wait. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Drove 15 min to eat my birthday lunch since they do the $10 off deal, but upon arrival at the register I was told my order would need to be dine-in only and couldn't do take out.  Ruined my afternoon.  Good to know as I'll be skipping this place for future birthdays.  I'll just stick with Joes BBQ."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here today and I don't know why this place has so many reviews! I ordered the Liberty Joe, it has absolutely no flavor at all. It tasted like it has canned sauce, and I'm sure the meat was not real. It came with a side of the most bland pasta salad I have ever tasted, no flavor at all. I had to put salt and pepper on for flavor. Would not EVER go back here again. I should have saved a lot of money and got 2 tacos from Jack in the Box! Horrible. I gave it one star because the building is nice inside.."}
{"text":"Came here for a late last minute Mother's Day lunch.  We got the Rancher Salad, the Arizona Pressed Sandwich w/a side of the artichoke salad, the White Pizza & a slice of Carrot Cake.  All the dishes and sides were wonderful and the service was super friendly and prompt.  The ambiance was also really chill and the outside patio was very cute.

I think this is my new favorite place in downtown Gilbert.  Will have to come back to check out their breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"UPDATE (May 2009): I tried Liberty for breakfast and they have a good selection...the chorizo egg dish was great.  My kids loved the pancakes.  I'm still iffy on other food, I'll have to give it another try, but the breakfast was a much better experience than the dinner.

I guess this is one of Joe's (BBQ/Farm Grill) establishments?  If so, this one misses the mark.  I couldn't disagree more with other reviewers.  Liberty Market had an opportunity to really be something special. 

The Space: is awesome.  Well done inside.  It's comfortable, casual and eclectic.  The story ends there for me.  I went there with my daughter and when I looked at the menu my thought was \"that's it?\"  I felt like it was way overpriced pannini's...that's about it.

I had one of the signature sandwiches and it was \"okay\" -- nothing to write home (or anywhere else) about for sure.  My daughter opted for the Liberty Joe which I felt was canned Manwich.

Again, they killed it with the environment, but the food needs a lot of help.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but the coffee area did look impressive...a lot of people were there that night just for some coffee and they seemed pleased.

Give me a reason not to go across the street to Joes BBQ...so far you haven't."}
{"text":"Great foods and selection of drinks! I also love their system. 
They also have awesome bathroom.

I love the way I can see their cooking."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place to hang out with the girls and share a carafe of Mimosa. Try the Green Chile scramble!"}
{"text":"There are few places you can get a cinnamon roll the size of your head.  Considering, the cost is pretty reasonable"}
{"text":"My boyfriend works in downtown Gilbert and we were looking for a place to eat.  We walked in and there was a really long line.  You wait in line to order then they give you a table, after that someone brings you your food.  We waited for only about 15 minutes (which is common wait for most restaurants on a Sunday morning so no biggie).  I got a pizza and my boyfriend got something for breakfast.  My pizza was amazing and my boyfriend liked his food.  We would for sure go back."}
{"text":"I am a long time customer and I love Liberty Market. The food is fresh and always taste great. Some of my favorites are the best chicken sandwich, their morning chilaquiles with chicken. The espresso drinks are good as well."}
{"text":"I will drive out of my way to go back to Liberty Market.  The staff was incredible.  When they realized we hadn't been there before, they suggested what to get (insisted really) and wow were they right.  The food is fabulous.  There were 4 of us and all agreed, will go back soon.  It was on our way to a hike in the Superstitions, so it gave us a great start to a beautiful hike.  I highly recommend the pancakes with bacon inside.  Don't crinkle your nose until you try it !!"}
{"text":"This place is wicked awesome! Great food and unique decor! Another home run by Joe!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  The breakfast was as good as it gets.  I liked how you could re-fill your own coffee, no need to wait for a server.  It is so bright and cheery there and I had such a nice time with my friends."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out and find batter stuff all under one roof. 

Will come back after some time..........."}
{"text":"I never would have gone in here if my boyfriend had not insisted and I'm so glad I did! I'm really picky and the menu was a little different for my liking but I ordered a picnic sandwich for lunch and it was awesome. The sweet potato salad on the side was my favorite part though, I would highly recommend getting it. All the pastries looked really great and the pizzas I saw at the table next to us looked really good as well. I will definitely be returning to try more on the menu! There was a long wait but I didn't mind, it just gave more time for indecisive me to make up my mind. After we ordered it did not take long for our food to get to us though.  The atmosphere inside is also very cool, although crowded for good reason!"}
{"text":"Visited Liberty Market with my husband and we had a delicious breakfast and a wonderful time sitting in the patio section. I had the green chili pork scramble, while he had the Sicilian scramble, both were full of flavor and cooked perfectly. We'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The white pizza and picnic sandwich are amazing. Today I had the butterscotch pudding. It is officially my new favorite dessert! Always great service and great food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been going for a few years. The new comfy booth style seating gives it a cozier feel. Love the décor and hip way they've incorporated the shopping carts, old fashioned soda bottles, exposed beams and brick etc to keep true to the 'Liberty Market' history.

The food is always fab! I've never been there with anyone who didn't love their meal.

Pastries are also delish. I'd rather not stand in line to order, but it kind of goes with the café style.

I definitely recommend trying out Liberty Market. If you go at night, be ready for a long line."}
{"text":"It's certainly a winner when both my boyfriend and myself (vegetarian) love our entrees. I had the veggie panini and he had the spicy burger. The barista and bakery skills ate on point as well great cappuccino and the best oatmeal creme pie I've had!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite restaurant in Gilbert. Here's why:

First, I love the cafe style restaurant and the scenery it's decorated in: brick walls, open kitchen, long tables, etc. All of Joe's restaurants (Joe's BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill) do this excellently.

Second, awesome lunch food. Truth be told, I've never even been there for dinner because I'm always hitting it up for lunch (I don't even take advantage of any specials, I just think it has a great lunch atmosphere). The Hollywood Cobb salad is my personal favorite. It's what I order almost 90% of the time I go. Nothing on the menu is too greasy and as far as I know most of the food is local.

Third, great staff. No one on duty seems to be having a bad time, something that speaks highly to the management. And they do a great job of recognizing repeat customers (esp. the girl who's always running the espresso bar, I wish I could remember her name)."}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere, great food. Never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. We usually hit it up for lunch/brunch, but ventured in for dinner tonight. The halibut with cauliflower was amazing! I don't know how they made cauliflower taste so good, but I will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"I can hardly think of a better place to start a weekend than with a breakfast  at Liberty Market. Take a good friend and split an American Standard with meatballs, or just go with a \"small\" item on the breakfast menu (it won't be that small!) Wash it down with some OJ, a delicious mocha, or just some water. Break out the laptop if you're too busy to really relax, cuz they have free wifi! Still hungry? Pick something from their pastry case (I HIGHLY recommend their grilled, or regular, bread pudding.)"}
{"text":"Love the atmoshpere here have been here a few times and have had a great experience everytime.  The lines can be a little long but I don't know of a good place that doesn't have a wiat. The food that i've tried is excellent. I've had the Grilled Chicken Pasta and the Picnic Sandwich."}
{"text":"An incredibly unique concept. Fantastic food .great service . A must do if you are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Joe Johnston is one of the best things to ever happen to Gilbert!  We love Joe's Real BBQ and LOVE Joe's Farm Grill... but our favorite restaurant is now Liberty Market!  We've been there at least 10 times and it's the place we always want to take our friends and family.

Our menu selections have never disappointed, from the Best Chicken Sandwich to the White Pizza to the Tower Burger to the decadent Red Velvet cake that's as big as your head!  The espresso bar is awesome too.

The staff is always smiling, friendly and working hard!  Thank you to Joe for making this place a reality in Gilbert.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed at.Liberty Marlet! Picnic salad and whit pizza to go! Pinot Project Pinot noir was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've only been once, and earlier that day I had stared into a full-length mirror, thinking, wow, I seriously need to stop eating so badly.\"

So, my one opinion on the one food item I've eaten, the beet salad: wow that was good. Pretty sure that was the first time in my"}
{"text":"Nice place, good atmosphere ! Food is ok. They have really good espresso !"}
{"text":"We first saw this joint on a Saturday when it was just as packed as it's fellow downtown Gilbert neighboring restaurants, and wanted to see what it was about. So I yelped it to see what people were saying. We returned for dinner and studied the menu, but ate like it was lunch time (?). We ordered 2 of their \"Italia\" panini sandwiches (their sandwiches come with a cold side). The paninis were amazing (fresh, and not thrown together), and the side of tomato-cucumber salad I enjoyed was tasty. They have a nice assortment of local beers as well, which is always a plus. Service was great. I think we'll try it out for lunch next time."}
{"text":"I love this fancier, casual restaurant in downtown Gilbert.  Great food, great service, great ambiance."}
{"text":"I love this place. The workers are friendly and helpful. The Martguerita Pizza was wonderful. A lot of love and work have gone into making the food as good as the atmosphere. It is good enough to drive from Phoenix, to come back, and back again."}
{"text":"This deli style restaurant has everything you want.  Good service, inviting atmosphere, super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious!

I had the Salmon BLT.  I did not even have to ask the friendly order taker to make the bacon crisp or the salmon to be slightly charred.  Everything about this wonderful sandwhich was perfect.  To be honest, I would switch out the the shredded iceberg lettuce for spinach leaves.  Still the sandwhich was terrific with it's nice proportion and the aioli sauce to bring it all together.

My dining comanion had the spinach and sirloin salad which was also completely finished at the end of the meal.  By the looks of the empty bowl it came in- it must have been really good!

There are some other items on the menu I look forward to trying out next time, like the wood fired pizzas and the burgers.
Great location in the heart of old town Gilbert.  Galleries and other small businesses are in the same area.

A great find.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The people at Liberty Market where so incredibly rude!!! I went there for desert for my birthday and Cashier was so snobby never again!!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place, the staff are always super friendly and welcoming. The food is always amazing and fresh. You can tell they care about every dish and you can taste the passion/love in every bite. Love the sweet potato salad !"}
{"text":"don't know where to begin........the concept works, the food is beyond delicious, the coffee to die for, extremely clean and friendly.............and the bathrooms such a simple, sane idea. love love love the place, will definately go back"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. We made a reservation a month ago for our wedding dinner with our family from out of state (on a Thursday), and despite the email from the manager with the confirmation of our reservation we were not accommodated. The manager  was useless and we had much better service elsewhere. Go anywhere but Market Place Restaurant and have a great experience. Don't bother with reservations here, they don't care about you or your business."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about. The line was really long, so I assumed the food would be amazing. It was average tasting food. Not worth standing in the long line."}
{"text":"Maybe Gail is confused. This is not a place for people with bentleys and those horrible yelping dogs. that most likely said women keep in their car or transport there dog in a carrier bag draped on their shoulder. Liberty Market is a place to relax and not to find the stereotypical scottsdale crowd. This is Gilbert, it was hay fields and cows not too long ago. People in  Gilbert are more relaxed and not worried by things of 'oh gosh is my 3rd generation pedigree welsh terrier barking at people in my posh car'. 

Food was amazing and the owner, Joe, is absolutely the best restaurateur in existence. He MADE my dining night. Walked in for the first time on a monday evening, approached the coffee bar and started to talk to the barista a bit about how the design is amazing, perfect balance of modern and country. Wonderful coffee and at the end the barista extended his hand for a shake and said, 'By the way, my name is Joe.\" I was astonished by this. He checked in with me and my party the whole night just talking about food, all the equipment, and just tales of opening. He truely is what all resturant owners need to live up to. He seems to have a king midas touch, Coffee Plantation (before he sold it), Joe's Real BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill, and now Liberty Market are all his. I now understand why they are so popluar. It is because of the owner. I live in Tempe and I can see me making the commute at least once a week just for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the ordering process here, but the food is very good and the carrot cake is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Came this morning for breakfast with my wife. I got buttermilk pancakes and bacon. She got the Demi. We both got liberty potatoes and a cinnamon roll to share. The food was great. I'm not a fan of standing in line to order but I'd probably do it again. They forgot my bacon but happily got me some. I wish the prices weren't so high though."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Food is always fresh and let's not forget the yummy desserts too!"}
{"text":"Cute place in downtown Gilbert.  Clean, friendly staff and great service. I have a hard time deviating away from the Denver scramble for breakfast. Make sure to get an oatmeal cream pie to go, and see if you can actually get out the door without eating it all first! :)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Would definitely return to try something else. We tried the chilaquiles (which was not that good) and the Breakfast Burrito (ok I guess)... but the nearby plates of sandwiches and regular breakfast options looked amazing so will be going back for more when on town."}
{"text":"Same owners as Joe's Farm Grill with different but still great food and service. Good variety of foods to choose from and the location in old downtown Gilbert is a great spot."}
{"text":"I love how you can see everything going on in the kitchen.  The food is fresh and delish.  I just ordered breakfast and the best part of it was the pancakes!  It was fluffy and didn't taste like it came from a box.  The syrup they gave you is a bit watery but still good!  Hubby got the crab poboy and was surprised  how much crab you get!  Will definitely come back and try the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy the food, layout, and service style of Liberty Market. However, the prices are a bit steep, and you really don't get a lot of food- depending on which items you order. Albeit, everything is fresh, tasty, and goes down easy. I have noticed quite often that tables do not get bussed, and when I have asked, or another guest has asked an employee for something, They don't receive it. The sense of urgency just isn't there.. I had asked someone at the register a couple questions about side options, and was blankly stared at for a few seconds. Then I received a somewhat curt response, as if I was being rude? Anyway, I give this place three stars because it really is a nice place to eat, and I will go here to do business with friends. I'd much rather come here than the Postino across the street. Sitting outside or near the pizza oven is usually the best spot. If you don't like 'cafeteria style' seating, then this place won't work for you. It gets loud, because of the brick walls and multiple voices talking at once. I do recommend the sweet potato side, and pretty much any of the sandwiches. I wasn't too impressed with the pizza. Didn't fill us up much."}
{"text":"My family frequents Liberty Market and it never disappoints! As far as vegetarian options, they have a few. I get the picnic salad with no meat, the caprese sandwich, or the veggie pizza. Their caprese is the best I've had! Their pizza is baked in a brick oven and the crust is amazing! Every once in awhile they have a special soup that is vegetarian or a homemade black bean burger, so you may luck out with additional vegetarian options."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA ANYWHERE !!! The owners are incredibly nice and put a lot of effort and pride in their business."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Liberty Market!  It definitely has a few down sides, but the positive far outweighs the negative.

Pros: Great food!  The wood oven pizzas are delicious, good salads and sandwiches, great desserts and awesome coffee. Of course the location is a plus for me - it's conveniently located for me.  They also offer some good wine and beer options and great weekly specials.  Customer service is on the spot. First time I ever remember going to LM a few years ago, someone stopped by and chatted with us...I can't remember whom.  When he found out it was our first time, he brought us some cortaditos.  Most recently, I was there with a friend who just moved into the neighborhood. I was showing her some of the \"cool\" spots. Our server spilled her drink on her...he was very apologetic, no damage was done and he offered to buy her a drink or dessert.  We took him up on the dessert. Great family owned establishment with excellent customer service.

Cons:  The only cons that I might have are the following - but mind you these aren't deal breakers:  I find that some of the entrees are little overpriced.  I recently went on a date there and he got a pasta dish. I found it to be rather pricey given a small salad or such does not come with it. If you were at a sit down restaurant, it normally would. So that leads me to one of my not so favorite things - the stand in line and order your food and pay right then and there concept is not the greatest (for me).  It can lead to awkward moments.  :) However, I get that that is their \"thing\" and it's not a deal breaker.  Lastly, I wish they would change up their sides a little more often. 

Other than that, it is a great way to experience downtown Gilbert. The food is tasty and customer service is great.  No real complaints here!  :)"}
{"text":"This Place is Awesome, Right beside Joes BBQ, ive only had one bad experience (there burger was uncooked) but there changing menu to whatever in season makes this place AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Tasty food (I had the white pizza, it was a.ma.zing.) and outstanding service. I've only been here twice but today we had a huge group celebrating a birthday and they bent over backwards to accommodate all of our requests. (Let us order at the bar, got extra waters, silverware, took pics for us, gave us a stack of to-go boxes, etc.) It was a lovely celebration because of the awesome way our group was treated. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Coffee is always great. Food is always awesome. Place is always packed but whoever the guy seating people on Saturday is always super helpful and nice getting us a spot to eat. Don't know how you can always be so nice but that guy is."}
{"text":"Liked it, I've hit a bunch of new places in Gilbert lately and Im on a streak.
I had the omlette with green chilis and salsa in the middle.

99% of breakfast places, this wouldnt of been good, but the salsa was freeking perfect. Be preparred to wait, there's always a line. Worth it tho."}
{"text":"I have been to Liberty Market numerous times, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  By far dinner is my choice here.  Wasn't crazy about the breakfast.  Not bad, just didn't \"wow\" me.  

They have OUTSTANDING pizza.  I am a huge fan of brick oven pizza, and this is right up there.  The Grilled Chicken Pasta is amazing, and the Flat Iron Steak is one of my favorites too.

Save room for dessert, as they have some great stuff to offer.  Word of warning...if you order the ice cream sandwich, share it with a group of 4!  It's not small!"}
{"text":"Their coffee bar is amazing and is well-known around the valley. It has made top 10 lists and for good reason. I think about stopping in anytime I am close by.

I only have gone there for breakfast and it gets busy pretty quickly. I have gone early enough to beat the rush but just barely so expect some type of wait if you do not get there by 730ish.

The service has always been great but there is no designated server so to get a to-go box or more ketchup is a bit hard because you have to see somebody on the staff and grab them because they are moving around so fast. This is a little issue that I could see others not liking but it was not that bad. Plus if it is taking awhile, just drink your delicious coffee."}
{"text":"I cannot wait to go back to Liberty Market!  I had the Farmer pressed sandwich and it was delicious!  The side pasta salad was good, too.  The other sides and desserts looked amazing!  I want to go back and try everything. 
Also- staff was very friendly.  You just get a good vibe being in there."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go in Gilbert (Joes BBQ a close 2nd). Love the Salmon BLT. Awesome service, chef's approach you when you walk in to go over the specials and answer any questions you might have. All of the desserts are great as well."}
{"text":"We're big LM fans. They have great costumer service and a great social media presence. We go several times a month. The burgers are very good, I love their margarita pizza, amazing rice pudding, the Cali Cobb salad with ranch is a favorite. There's has rarely been a time I've tried something and didn't like it, although I'm not a big fan of most of their desserts."}
{"text":"This review would be closer to 4.5 stars but I couldn't bring myself to only give them 4. The tower burger and white pizza are my favorites. The salads are so refreshing and made with fresh ingredients. The ice cream cookie sandwich and red velvet cake are fantastic! The line is the only frustrating part when they are busy you can easily stand in line for over an hour before you even order. It is best to go during off peak hours."}
{"text":"I met some family here for breakfast and the food was great.  The staff was extremely helpful and made some great suggestions.  It does get noisy but at least it covered up the tantrum my child threw!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and this is our go-to dinner place when we want a variety. My husband and I have different tastes and Liberty satisfies both of us. I love the salmon BLT with avocado. The hummus is tasty. Their ice cream cookies are a great way to end it if you still have room. Staff is always friendly and helpful. I always try to take new people to introduce them to this great place!"}
{"text":"Best desserts in town. Free food for your birthday  The salads and sandwiches are A M A Z I N G but the rice pudding is the best I've had at a restaurant. Parking is not optimal."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is my favorite place to get brunch in the area. I've had a handful of items off the menu, but, by far, my favorite two items are the  french toast and the breakfast burrito. 

First, the french toast. They have a different take on it so it is actually bread pudding. It's moist, sweet without being too sweet, and def some of the best french toast I've ever had. It's pretty much FLAWLESS. 

Next, the breakfast burrito. I'm usually not a huge fan of breakfast burritos, but this baby is def a winner. The sauces on top are far from bland and are what make the burrito so good. Of course the meat and potatoes inside add a lot, but the sauce is what truly makes it so spectacular. 

I've had a couple of other items off the menu such as the sandwiches (breakfast and lunch), pizza, and red velvet cake, but none are to rave about. However, if I was going to add another item to my meal, it'd be the cinnamon bun. Beware, it's quite large and only tastes good while warm."}
{"text":"If your looking for AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, A ONE IN A MILLION ATMOSPHERE, go to Liberty Market!!!

Pros: Different Menus through out the day with Amazing Food every time, Great Great Great Prices for the Quality you receive, PERFECT Size of Plates, Not to little to share and not to much to eat if your REALLY HUNGRY!! Amazing Deserts if you still have room, Awesome Drinks & the feeling that the \"Staff\" is really a family working towards a goal of providing the best food & customer service for each and every customer! Be sure to check out the AWESOME Bathrooms as well... Thats right every single one is different!! :-) 

Cons:.... Not a Single thing!! 

Its worth the wait if there is a line, COMPLETELY WORTH THE WAIT!! :-)"}
{"text":"The food as usual very very good.  The long line looks deceiving, as it moves very fast.  Seating already saved for you prior to ordering the food.  The best part of our visit today was John at the entrance.  He was great to talk with had the same personality of the restaurant, very warm and personable.  The food is always great but today John was the 3 cherries on the sundae. Tell John this is the guy from Tucson.  Hey Chris."}
{"text":"Interesting hangout and I've had good coffee there, but unfortunately the coffee quality is not consistent. The cappuccino was watered down yesterday, and there is this host that is like the Nazi that tells you you cant stand here, you can't sit here, and honestly, their ordering system is very inconvenient. You can't just sit and order from a waiter. No. You have to get in line and the line is long some times. One time I'm told to order coffee at the coffee bar and food on the opposite side, and the other order everything on the opposite side. Very confusing .The seats are hard and the place gets so noisy. The food is expensive, and the pizza is just ok. It is, however, a contemporary place, and if these people improve the way food is ordered and delivered, it would be a highly desirable place to frequent."}
{"text":"Part of it may be nostalgia. If you grew up in G'Town you shopped at Liberty Market when it was the town's general store. Maybe you and your cousins would show up in a pack to buy a coke (in a bottle) and pick up some groceries for the grandparents. 

Joe Johnston, always respectful of Gilbert's history and people, has opened a great place to grab a casual meal with family and friends.  The breakfast is the best.  Especially the biscuits.  They taste just like the one's my nana used to make.  

They have a bit for everyone on the menu, including great coffee, a nice selction of craft beers and a decent wine list.  It can get crowded around meal times but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town for a wedding and needed a place for breakfast. We originally planned on going to The Farmhouse next door but the wait was out the door so we walked in to Liberty Market where the line was long but at least it was inside.  We were very happy with our experience. We were both super hungry  after waiting in line next to all of the fresh baked goods.  The sticky buns, cinnamon rolls, and sweet potato muffins were very inviting but we decided to wait and see what the situation was after we ate breakfast. 

I got the chilaquiles with chorizo. I was somewhat skeptical when ordering as I have been to places that basically put enchilada sauce on regular tortilla chips. These were the real deal!  The chorizo had that extra little kick of heat I look for in Mexican food. The cotijo cheese was a nice touch but my favorite part was the sunny side up eggs bringing it all together.

My wife had the biscuits and gravy with an egg over the top. Of course I had a few bites and enjoyed it. The biscuits were hearty and the sausage in the gravy was plentiful. It had a great flavor and we enjoyed it but would have liked the temperature to be a bit hotter. This was the only downside of our whole experience and the only thing that kept us from a 5.

Unfortunately we didn't have enough room for any of the goodies we saw while waiting in line, not even to go since we planned a couple of other grub sessions in the day.

GO HERE!"}
{"text":"No matter what I have ordered the meal is excellent. Especially like the salt river bars"}
{"text":"First visit and not a good experience. My breakfast came minus the biscuit and gravy and with no assigned server (you stand in line to order and food runners bring your plate) I had to go back inside (we sat in the outside patio) and request the rest of my breakfast. My breakfast was served but not the other two in my party. After a ten minute wait I started to eat it because it was getting cold. We stopped two different  food runners and asked about the rest of our order and were told \"I'm sure it will be right up\". We waited forty five minutes and nothing. The only thing they did right was refund the charge for the food that never came. They did apologize for the lousy service but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place - shame it took me so long to discover it! Everything I have eaten there so far has been amazing - especially in love with the breakfast scrambles & potatoes, the sticky buns and the pecan bars. Service always great and with a smile, and a nice atmosphere. After eating there nearly a dozen times, I think I have found somewhere deserving of a regular weekly visit!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is definitely an awesome place to grab a bite, should you find yourself in Gilbert.  I've had several items on the menu, including salads and paninis, and they were all good.  I've never been here for breakfast, but they do have an impressive looking espresso bar, and some of the largest baked goods I've ever seen.  Considering I have a cousin in Texas who makes cinnamon rolls as big as your head, you can only imagine what they looked like here, to be so impressive.  Also, I don't know what they put in that sweet potato salad, but it is crazy good!  

I do have to dock a star for the bathrooms.  Ironically enough, the person responsible for the layout and design of the bathrooms was on hand my first time here, and she gave me a lenghty spiel about how great the bathrooms were.  As I ventured to the back, and turned the corner, the horror of the situation slowly set in....UNISEX BATHROOMS!!!!   WHY, GOD WHY?!!!!    I MUST resist the urge to run screaming from the bathroom.   I then ran into the same person on the way out who was eager to know what I thought of the bathrooms.   \"Weren't they great?\"  Still stunned, I managed to sort of smile and nod, as I tried to hide my horror.  Moral of the story, go there to eat; go somewhere else when you have to go.."}
{"text":"It was our wedding anniversary and although I really didn't want to stand in line to order my food, Hubby selected the restaurant and I agreed to it. This was not our first visit but each one has been consistently good. While waiting in line I watched the brick oven pizzas being made and asked which variety was being assembled since I liked the ingredients - thin crust with parmesan, mozzarella, bacon, chicken all baked in the hot brick oven and then topped with arugula when it came out - on the menu it is the White pizza, one of the more popular ones. Still waiting in line to order, I watched the salads being assembled. Again I asked which one was being prepared - chopped kale, chopped cabbage, jicama, a liberal dusting of finely grated cheese (which turned out to be cotija), dried chopped apricots, corn and then something that was clear yet hard and then broken into the salad (which turned out to be pumpkin seed brittle) - doh, that must be the chopped salad! When it was served and I took a forkful, there was some heat in the dressing. I found out that Chef adds a bit of cayenne to it - just enough to pique your taste buds but not so much that it numbs it. Hubby had the baby back ribs which came with coleslaw and fingerling potatoes. There were enough ribs for two servings. I found my pizza and salad were both light enough and the right combination that I finished both. Hubby needed a takeout box for his ribs though. The waitstaff is very friendly and Chef goes around from table to table greeting all the guests. He's done that everytime we've been and I find that to be very welcoming and personable. Not seeing that we had any dessert, he asked if we had ordered one yet. No, I said, but welcome any recommendations since this was our wedding anniversary. He congratulated us and insisted that we have the coconut cream pie - on the house. Hubby and I shared the large slice that Chef brought to the table and it was delicious. So while I still don't like having to stand in line to order, the atmosphere and the friendliness of the Chef as he makes his rounds made it an enjoyable evening. And as we were leaving , one of the waitstaff also congratulated us on our wedding anniversary. How nice was that!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Check them out on Twitter for their weekend specials! Chef David rocks!"}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich and red velvet cake are my favorites. Breakfast is good here too. Not many breakfast choices but they have all the basics.  I would eat here every day but it's a little spendy. Worth the money though."}
{"text":"Rude service :-( Stopped in on a Sunday morning to have some Espresso with my wife.  The Cappachino and Latte were ok.  Unfortunately the manager wasn't able to keep her head with the busy morning.  She did have lots of people in line waiting for food but more than half of the seating was open (kitchen slower than people eat).  So instead of giving us and some other customers choice of open tables she insisted on bar seating and them in a rude way made us sit all the way to one end.  We saw her approach another customer in the same rude way while we were there."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times. Today it was quite slow inside.  I ordered the Denver Scramble. The scramble was good enough, but the potatoes were cold.  Literally cold.  I asked for an extra side and the manager brought it over. It was steaming and appeared very warm but that was just the surface.  The potatoes underneath were still not warm.  Husband ordered a demi breakfast.  He was disappointed to not be able to get an over easy egg.  They only come scrambled. He had a flat pancake, eggs, and one sausage link. We both had coffee.  Our bill was $26.  Overpriced for what we got. We will not go back again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food. Wide range of menu options. Try to go during \"off-peak\" hours to avoid the long lines."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Great burgers, pizzas, salads & desserts. The breakfast also holds its own weight. Ran by great people, it's a place you should check out when you can."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often during my travel to Arizona. My favorite part of this place is the coffee bar. They always seem to get the coffee perfect. I have had their cold-brew coffee, they have their own name for it and starts w T. Don't remember the exact name. I had the cappuccino and cortadito. All were amazing. The food is great too, but really I love this place for coffee. Yes, you can go to cartel and other wonderful local coffee places in phoenix. This one is unique too."}
{"text":"What is up with Arizona's love for order first then sit bs. U pay premium prices and then have to sand in line like ur in line at a cafeteria.  Lame. Anyway at least u don't have to tip I guess.  Still waiting for food just wanted to vent about the cafeteria style crap.....ok Got our food.  It is good. Good pizza.  Nice salads.  I'd eat again if it was not for the wait in line"}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Ingredients fresh and crust was nice and chewy! . Salad was fresh!  Beer was cold!  Everything we were looking for in a late lunch!"}
{"text":"The Strada Coffee Bar inside Liberty Market is amazing. All types of coffee drinks from your basic espresso to the house favorites Cortadito and Cortado. If you want a coffee #experience this is your place. Oh, the desserts are pretty amazing also!"}
{"text":"This was our first and last time to Liberty Market.

We ordered the biscuits and gravy and a side of liberty potatoes. It was a lot of food, which my wife and I split. We were impressed with the biscuits and gravy, they were pretty good. The liberty potatoes were very salty and greasy.

At the conclusion of eating the breakfast, my wife took a look at her Coke which came from the fountain, more specifically she looked at the glass, and there were bugs on the inside of the glass. Initially we thought that it was just a dirty glass. We looked closer, the bugs were alive and moving!

As we were examining the glass a waiter came by and asked if we had ants in our soda! We looked closer and they were ants! He apologized and took the glass and we saw him go over to the soda fountain to examine the soda nozzle. I then took a closer look at the Coke I was drinking, ANTS! Yup, they were in my glass too! And I had already drank two glasses!

The waiter came back over and said that he was going to comp our meal. I told him that it was in my glass too. He apologized asked for the bill to go and comp our meal. The problem was that while he was away another customer went to that same Coke nozzle and filled up her glass.

He came back with the comp'ed meal. We were disgusted, a little queasy, thanked him and left.

The problem was, as we were discussing after we had left the restaurant, the waiter seemed to already know what the problem was when he came up and asked if there was ants in the soda. And the fact that even he found out that there were ants in our soda he did nothing to prevent the lady who filled up her drink from the same nozzle!

\"Joe\" may be cool about insects crawling around on his food on the farm, but they need to be kept out of the sugary soda!"}
{"text":"Had dinner today.  No need to pile on all the good reviews...you get it; good food and an interesting place to be (Early Gilbert pictures, some paintings.)

The wife had the apricot chicken with the sweet potato mash.  I am guessing she liked it because she didn't say a word until she was finished.   

I had the Cuban sandwich.  I'd order it again.  The side potato salad was a 4 out of 5.  Yes, I know the Cuban has pork and ham; however IMO the pork took over the flavor.  Still, you can't go wrong with a pickle based sandwich.  

I am not sure I would like to be here when  it got really busy.  It is kind of weird to order and then seat yourself.  But it works.  

We will be back; I need to try the beet salad."}
{"text":"We end up in downtown Gilbert for a lot of date-night dinners, and while we love many of the options (Postino, Zinburger, Pomo come to mind), we end up back at Liberty Market more than any of the others.

The menu is an interesting mix of items, and we've never had a bad meal. The NY steak sandwich, crab po boy, cuban, wood-fired pizzas, and burgers are all favorites. On the weekends they always experiment with a new pizza and burger, which are fun to try. Whatever you do, do yourself a favor and order the rice pudding as your side!

We've even come to love the quirky seating arrangement where you stand in line, and a table is available for you by the time you order your food. I'd much rather stand in line for 30 minutes chatting and watching the kitchen work at Liberty Market, than wait 45 minutes for a table at another downtown Gilbert restaurant. 

A final note: this is a great to go if your group can't decide on what type of food they want. There's really something for everybody. I know we'll be back here again and again and again."}
{"text":"Seriously good customer service. We just had waters to drink with our meal. My wife went to fill them up and I asked her to add a lemon slice to it if they had any by the fountain. 30 seconds later, a waiter came to my table with a cup of sliced lemons. He said, \"I overheard you ask for lemons. We don't have any over by the fountain so I brought you some.\" On point!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Cubano sandwich . Very good! I was not thrilled however with the prices. 30$ for two sandwiches and two drinks. It was however a great atmosphere, and quick service!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Whether we come for breakfast/ lunch or dinner, I am always impressed with our food and service! I love the assigned seating they do on the busy times because I don't have to stress about fighting for a table; I can just relax and watch all the chefs prep and make food. Even when it is busy customers always seem to come first here."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast menu and items here. Staff is friendly and food is great. The decor and inside are neat. I will return."}
{"text":"The food is great. Came out perfectly. They have big comfortable booths. We had sandwiches & salads. Great time with friends!"}
{"text":"Gluten free options! Awesome italian soda/creme drink! Not to mention I found out you can order/eat at the espresso bar and skip that long line on the weekends! Definitely going to be back here again for breakfast! P.s. the owner is very friendly"}
{"text":"Liberty market is a great place to meet friends or family for a good, casual meal. The work that has been put into this space has payed off, and the pride the owners take in their business is evident.

I've been here four times, once for lunch and the other times for dinner. They have a good menu that has expanded from my early visits. You order and pay at the counter. The pros of counter service far outweighed the cons every time I've visited. Joining a group of friends is as simple as saying hi, placing your order at the counter, and sitting down. This style of service really shines when I attend with #evfn. Very few restaurants handle our group of 40+ with so little hassle. This makes for a great place to hang out and meet up with people.

When I had lunch here I had soup and a half size farmer's salad, the combo was on special. The minestrone hit the spot, and the salad was full of crisp, fresh vegetables. The salad and sandwich selection is good enough that I'd eat lunch here a few times a week if I lived or worked closer. For dinner the burger is my recommendation of the things I've tried. It was juicy and came with a good selection of condiments. I haven't had the opportunity to sample much of the new dinner menu. The grilled chicken pasta is pretty good, and I'm looking forward to trying the steak or the apricot glazed chicken on my next visit. I also hope to try their breakfast soon, I hear good things.

My only complaint is that the brewed tea by the soda fountain usually tastes old to me. No biggie, more reason to stick to drinks from E-61. The E-61 espresso bar makes some of the best drinks I've had in Phoenix. I can recommend the toddy, the chai tea, and the giant bowl of caffe mocha."}
{"text":"The food was good, but a bit high priced.  Standing in line to order took a very long time and then when you go to sit down, they DIRECT you to a table that they choose.  They don't give you a choice.  The tables are very close to each other and the high ceilings with cement floors make for noisy eating experience.  It's a nice place, quaint decor....but I prefer places where conversations are easier."}
{"text":"Every single thing is so delish! So full of flavor! Pizzas are my favorite! The staff and service have been exceptional every time! They make you feel so welcome and comfortable! I think the service is just as important as the food! Fantastic all around!!"}
{"text":"Awesome- found this on yelp so thanks to all who posted reviews. I had the picnic sandwich with the sweet potatoes salad with a glass of tap Chardonnay. Great choice. Hubby had the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce with veggies and smashed potatoes. It was to die for. Great food, great atmosphere. Repeat the next time we are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Good sized reasonable portions. Bonus Saturday mornings there is a farmers market behind the restaurant... So fill up and walk it off at the market all well buying fresh veggies for that nights dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  It is a trendy spot with lots of history.  I was happy with my sandwich but the sides were flavorless.  I guess I expected more..."}
{"text":"Went to Liberty Market for breakfast.  I thought the food was pretty decent.  It's a little fancy.  I'm there for food not looks.  It seems like a hipster joint but the staff was friendly.  Has a bit of a retro vibe inside.  I'd definitely go again and possible check out some of their baked goods."}
{"text":"I had heard lots of great things about this place, and had the opportunity to give it a try today for lunch. Ordered the farmers pressed panini which had roasted veggies and goat cheese. It was good for every bite where there was an abundance of veggies, but unfortunately most of the sandwich was dry and didn't have enough 'meat' for the size of the bread. It was also kind of dry, and would have been much better had there been some sort of spread on it or simply more goat cheese. 

I tried my husband's margarita pizza with roasted veggies and that too was just okay. The roasted veggies once again were very sparse and definitely not worth the $2 extra they charge for them. 

I also ordered a raspberry Italian soda - cremosa style, which tasted like half and half with sparkling water and no raspberry flavor. More on the disgusting side of flavors compared to everything else. I'd say skip this one if you are even considering trying this. 

For what I had expected of this place for their food it was just okay. Maybe i'll need to come back and give it another try with a different selection of items. Overall,  I did enjoy the atmosphere and ambience of the market so I excused the sub-par taste of the food!"}
{"text":"I love the charm of downtown Gilbert and am a huge fan of Liberty Market.  I think most people have eaten here but if you have not, definitely give it a try!  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the fact that I can choose from more than one item on the menu to satisfy my eating choices.  We celebrated my birthday over lunch at Liberty Market last year and it was so fun!  Definitely on my happy list!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place.  Great food from the guy who brought us Joes BBQ and Joes Farm Grill.  Tried the burger of the week, 6 Alarm Burger.  Was warned it was hot.   Guess what, it was.  Had good flavor though.  Not just hot to be hot.  You don't want hot? I've had the Tower Burger multiple times and it's great, add cheese and bacon."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place; how its decorated, the delicious food, and the friendly staff. I had the egg salad sandwich and it was perfect, just like my mom used to make, I haven't had a sandwich like that in a while. And the caprese pasta salad is sooo yummy. I can't wait to go back and try more

I wish this place was closer to my house because I would probably go there everyday! But it is defiantly worth the drive to support such a great local business."}
{"text":"The place was packed and we got served quickly at the coffee bar. I had a really tasty italian soda and watched the Barista do some crazy drinks. 

I really liked my breakfast. The potatoes were freaking amazing. I recommend."}
{"text":"Go here for Brunch! Lunch and dinner are fine, but the breakfast menu and the E61 coffee bar cannot be beat.

My usual order is a bowl of cafe au lait, and a veggie scramble.  The breakfast potatoes are so good.

It can get crowded, but if you're in a small group (2) you can usually skip the line and sit at the bar which is full service."}
{"text":"Incredible food! The Farmer is so delicious and I'm not even a fan of squash. The coffee is great and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"went there for Father's Day. Still a fan of Liberty Market. Still amazed that you have to tell them to cook the pizza \"well done\" to get it cooked right. Do people in Gilbert truly enjoy soggy wood-fired pizza??? The antipasto appetizer was first-rate. Everything is great here. I just wish they would cook the pizza right without special instructions."}
{"text":"I normally  would  not give 5 stars because I don't believe in perfection, always something to strive for better.  I originally gave them 4 but because of the rating system I have changed it to a 5 stars. Went Here after actually hearing so much about their neighbors(farmhouse), but in fact they are much more better than them. I really like the layout, it is efficient and comfortable and hide the fact that it is tight. 

First off, I came here and was really surprise by the food, it is innovative, creative, and very delicious. The first time I had the biscuit and gravy and potatoes, and they added bell peppers and onions and other spices not just the ordinary pepper and salt. The taste is lively and jumps out at you. The coffee I have to say is the best of any breakfast place, they actually paid enough attention to the detail here. Other places, it is probably just foldgers or something, but usually bland and tasteless. 

I came back and tried their version of french toast. It is a bread pudding that is very moist and they get it crispy enough on the outside with the exception of the center. It looks small for the price but 2 piece filled me up very well. Actually one of the better twist on french toast and I know french toast. 

The third visit, I tried their italian scramble, and it was awesome. It was moist because of the tomatoes and just a touch of spice in the sausage and peppers. The biscuit was moist and flaky, excellent. I tried the scramble next door and it was a total bland city. 

All in all, this is a place that I can't wait to come back to even though they have a limited menu, but what they have is excellent. If you are not one to try new things, then it is not a place for you. The traditional is next door, but the best is definitely here."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is great. A nice spot in the middle of Old downtown Gilbert. Great atmosphere for family. I've been there with family members for breakfast and the chilaquiles with chorizo is the best I've had. Sweet potato muffins are amazing as well. Definitely my go to. I've been once for dinner but wasn't too impressed I'll stick with breakfast!"}
{"text":"Support this local gem in downtown Gilbert. Simple modern architecture and a unique dining experience. 1st visit was for lunch and there subs are amazing. 2nd trip for breakfast - somewhat limited selection, but very tasty. Coffee bar and different deserts made fresh every morning also a reason to visit. Spread the word and check it out. A refreshing change!"}
{"text":"I loved so many menu items at this place It was hard to decide what to get. But I settled on the crab po boy and it was delicious. Two crabcakes on perfectly toasted bread with a delicious sauce. Im not a fan of cilantro but it just worked. I enjoyed this sandwich so much. The atmosphere here was pretty cool. Theres a separate bar area, too. This place is one of my faves for sure."}
{"text":"The quality of food is good here.  It is nice that you can get a good look at most of the items as you stand in line to order.  But that is also the down side.  Every time I have gone there has been a big line.  They do have a nice birthday benefit.  It is worth going then even with a line."}
{"text":"We really like this place! It is easy to get in, be seated, and the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market, but only for breakfast.

I recently tried the pasta with meatballs while dining out with my wife and a friend for dinner. This entree supports my theory that Liberty Market should stick to what they do best - breakfast.

I was in a hurry, otherwise I would have requested a new plate of something else. The meatballs were dry. They came with a side of bread that was really dry. The flavors in the meatballs were bland and the texture was not what one would expect from a meatball. Pass on the pasta and meatball plate.

Liberty Market for breakfast is hard to beat and the staff is very friendly, but my advice is to stay away for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food and wine was amazing but there is one reason we will not return.  Midway through my meal I was really ready for another glass of the yummy cab I was drinking from Napa but the line to get another glass was so long and my food would have gotten cold if I would have waited.  If this restaurant was sit down with wait staff I would be there all the time.  Amazing food, great wine, poor concept."}
{"text":"I've gone here many times for birthdays and for group lunches or dinners. Basically everything is awesome, but the white pizza and the desserts are my favorite! The macaroons were pretty old and stale tasting and a little too expensive. I love the different bathrooms styles they have for each stall/room. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice quality of foods, but you have to order at cashier's desk. A coffee bar is a big plus,,, very nice soothing bathroom."}
{"text":"I recently went to Liberty Market with my girlfriend. She wanted to take me to a breakfast place I have never been to before and was very impressed.

We stood in line and wondering how we were going to get a table in the restaurant since it was so packed (Saturday around 10am). One of the employees handed us a menu and asked if it was our first time there. We said yes. He told us how the system works and gave us a card with a number on it and told us he would get us a table a place a duplicate card with our number on it. Right before we ordered our food our table was ready.

I ordered the American Standard since I wanted a classic breakfast meal. I ordered the gravy since it came with a biscuit. I also ordered a  large iced latte. Most of the time I am hesitant  to order a latte at a restaurant  because I am such a coffee snob but the latte was quite good, I could taste the espresso without feeling like I had a glass of milk with a splash of espresso. There was not much bitterness to the espresso and was smooth and flavorful. The food was even better than the coffee. Breakfast is one of my favorite meals. When my food was brought to me I asked for some ketchup for my potatoes but as soon as I tried them I didn't even use any ketchup since the were so delicious they way they came. 

I had a great experience with this restaurant and will be recommending it to anyone looking for a place to get some great food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The line to order is really unique, sometimes I don't mind other times it's annoying. The decor is great and I Love the bathrooms! Parking is not very convenient. 

The pizza is GREAT. I think I get the Moline? The salads look amazing but I've never been able to get past the pizza. The desserts look great but I'm  never overly impressed when I get one. 

The espresso is very good and always nice wine and unique beers in bottles. The service is always very helpful and nice. 

The one missing star? It's not kid friendly at all and it's not worthy of the cost of a sitter(I'm sorry to say but I must be honest). My kids hate, hate, hate to go there. I think they feel unwelcome and the food is not designed for kids. We usually order them a $12-15 pizza FOR EACH and then tell the cashier to take all the expensive ingredients off which they do and we end up with a very expensive cheese pizza. The last time we visited someone finally said we could just order a cheese pizza at a reduced price, Thank you!

In the end Gilbert is so lucky to have Liberty Market!"}
{"text":"My son just got home from Liberty Market, food poisoning!, be careful of beet salad. We called and Politely, mentioned to the manager(Jason) he might want to check the beet salad, Wow did his defenses come alive!! Didn't ask for anything, no refund no free meal, just wanted to give him a heads up so no one else got sick. Ironically, a coworker and I were talking about LM just today, and she said her meal was not good on Friday, bad greens in the beet salad. A shame the way Jason handled this, normally enjoy Liberty Market food is usually good...Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"5 stars....No Question.  Food options are good but I can only ever really focus on the Latte's.  Outstanding.  If you have not gone...make it a point.  If you really enjoy an authentic Latte then you will be returning again and again."}
{"text":"Had a father's day lunch and enjoyed every mouthful of my Tower Burger!  The pineapple relish and chipotle aoli were sensational additions to the Niman Ranch meat patty and aged cheddar cheese.  My wife enjoyed her \"picnic\" sandwich equally well, so we're looking forward to repeat performances at this restaurant in downtown Gilbert.  Everything we saw being served around us looked fantastic, too!"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth every penny. Salmon BLT...sweet potato muffin, hand crafted lattes with pretty designs in the foam? Sold"}
{"text":"I always like to come here because the service and food is excellent. No matter what time you show up, they will always seat you promptly. They have a great system where there is someone who will come up to you when you are in line waiting to place your order. He will ask how many people will be in the party and there is always a table waiting for us when we have placed the order. It is a pity they are only in Gilbert."}
{"text":"The first time we went, I got the best chicken sandwich and the Mr. got the white pizza. The sandwich really was excellent, but I have ordered the white pizza every time since and never looked back. That thing is amaaaaazing. 

They have some decent side dishes and desserts, notably the red velvet cake (which is usually a little dry, but good), and the salt river bar, which is VERY yummy. 

There is usually a wait. I wish there was a separate line for picking things up that don't have to be made, i.e. desserts. I've also only ever seen one register going. But anyway, the wait has never been ridiculous like it can be at other Joe's establishments. 

I took a star off for the wait, and for the service, which can be hit or miss. Sometimes they seem to go above and beyond and other times it seems like they forget about you after you ask for something (I've experienced this with high chairs, silverware, and to-go boxes). 

Go on a weekday/night and get the white pizza - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I love love love liberty market!! A must place to go! The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly! The coffee is absolutely great I suggest getting the cortado!! Never a disappointment at liberty market!"}
{"text":"Just perfect !!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Crowded and noisy, and you have to stand in line to order, no table service.  But every item on the menu is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Usually for breakfast before or after the Gilbert Farmers Market.  I am always pleased by the food, service and atmosphere.  Today I discovered that they changed the iced tea that they serve. No.big deal you say? I love iced tea.  Fresh brewed.  Black tea. No fancy flavors.  Now it is fruity. That might be your thing. More power to you. It is not for me. I found out by taking a sip. Ugh. No problem. They promptly exchanged it for a hot chocolate and with a smile on there face. I love great service."}
{"text":"This is another home run from the people who brought us such wonderful places as Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill. 

Liberty Market is excellent for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or just coffee. Yes, I know because I spent many a day/morning/night studying for the bar exam here. They have a nice selection of beers and wine for dinner (or a particularly heinous lunch study session). For lunch, the Maiden Lane sandwich or the Farmer are my favourites and their pasta salad is an excellent side. 

For dinner, burgers are always good but so is the \"Best Chicken Sandwich\" which really is very good. For dessert, I always like their homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich with a glass of champagne. 

The market is also really nice for cute gifts and food items. Also, check out the bathrooms, seriously. Very clever and cute.

This place is awesome but expect to wait if it's during peak hours."}
{"text":"Totally adore this place...Love the business location and you should def. check out the bathroom here...Great Food!!! - Love The Wood-Fired Pizza"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent in every category.  Atmosphere, coffee, bakery, it all seems to be very very good."}
{"text":"Love there Mocha coffee and sandwich called the Picinic with slices green apples in it so yummy"}
{"text":"Had an awesome ahi tuna and risotto meal. Had a bed of risotto which wasn't too much just right and not too starchy or overpowering. Topped with seared ahi tuna that was cooked just right and had veggies accompany it with some bok Choi. It's not on the menu and was once of their dinner specials. Worth the 23 bucks and we always have awesome meals here. I always bring out if towers here because their attention to service and detail is great. Keep it up liberty market."}
{"text":"Loud, you stand in line to order, then they assign you a table, so the whole group has to stay in line, table was assigned after our 25 minutes in line.  
Did I say loud?  Close seating, not made for conversation.  
Pizza was decent, sandwiches good.  
Better for a quick bite than lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Wow wow wee wow the white pizza is incredible! 
Ambiance is nice.
The bakery is so tempting, great when you need that chocolate fix"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Liberty for a number of years now. Up until recently, I would have given 5 stars, but our most recent experiences were a little disappointing over what we were used to. The food was not quite the same - quality wise.  We're willing to give them another try."}
{"text":"A recent addition to our dining pantheon, Liberty Market has yet to serve us something we weren't impressed with. In the few months since they have been open, (October 2008), we have been back numerous times for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.

Their menu is still evolving and a few new items are added from time to time. This is a major plus for any restaurant keeping the choices changing and the menu fresh.

They have a wonderful selection of breakfast items and baked goods all with a bit of a twist to them that you are sure to enjoy.

Lunch and dinner feature pressed sandwichwes with fresh ingredents like arugula, basil, fontina and gorgonzolla cheese, balsamic viniger and some of the finest meats to be found on fresh made daily breads. Their wood fired pizza oven puts forth the best pies you'll find this side of Italy with a wonderful crust that is both crunchy and toothful.

The finest carrot cake around for dessert and truly fine coffee. Not to mention the best bowl of hot chocolate on the planet, made from scratch not a can of syrup. Yum!

You owe it to your self to give Liberty Market a try, your tounge and your tummy will thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent. Had the Italiana (panini). Fantastic. Sooo delicious. And there are at least a dozen more menu items I look forward to trying.

Great decor & ambiance, excellent service, personable contact with the owner-management team. All qualities prided upon for sure. If they weren't so far from Tempe I'd be there once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't  reviewed this place. It is number 1 on my breakfast\" \"go to\" places. I like everything about Liberty Market. From the historical  Market door used as a white board posting specials as you walk in, to the hanging Edison bulb lighting, to the  exposed brick, it just screams cool. It is not a chain and the food is delicious.
Be warned the portions are huge so we usually split a meal. The scrambles are delish. Just had the Sicilian today, three eggs, onion, mozzarella, tomato and Italian sausage. Yum. 
Special shout out to the creatively decorated mixed gender bathrooms and free wifi!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and I am sure we'll be back to try lunch and dinner!  Everything was freshly made and the best orange juice I have ever had.  Don't forget to check out the bathrooms with the \"graffiti\" recipes on the walls."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is my favorite place to go for good coffee, good food, good people.  The staff makes that place what it is.  They are friendly, efficient, and just genuinely good people.  The espresso bar is by far my most favorite part of this establishment.  You always meet a new person at that bar while enjoying a nice cup of coffee.  I typically work on my laptop while there and chat with the baristas and other patrons.  The food is beyond delicious.  Most entres are very filling and do yourself a favor and try the red velvet cake.  They always have something new from the baker worth trying.  The owners are all great people who will do anything for their customers.  Like previous posts, do yourself a favor and check out the bathrooms, I prefer the chef's.  See you at the E-61 Bar."}
{"text":"Yummy lunch!  I had the BLT and hubby had the Salmon BLT.  My sandwich came out first, and we waited about ten minutes before my husband's sandwich came out.  The gentleman that served us apologized and offered free dessert!  The carrot cake was tasty too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but we went during Valentines day so there was a huge line! I would definetly come here again when it is not so busy."}
{"text":"Well, it  took 14 months of living all the way in New York for me to come back to Phoenix and finally make my way down to the bustling cultural metropolis of Gilbert with fellow OG Yelper Bonnie G to thoroughly check the town out. 

This fellow OG Yelper and I. We are not Gilbert. Gilbert is not us. But drove we did with open minds and empty bellies.

Our first stop: Liberty Market for lunch.

We walk inside, and I notice the place is bustling: part bright and sunny, part modern and Jetsons-like, and part HOLY CRAP I WANT TO EAT EVERYTHING I SEE BACK IN THE KITCHEN OVER THERE. 

I restrained myself of course because I am that way and waited till I got to the front of the line. I looked at all the options - every sandwich, pizza, salad, etc. sounded extremely tantalizing and my mouth was watering for them all, but in the end we both ordered a couple of the hot pressed sandwiches: 

* I got The Rancher ($12) - beef filet, caramelized onion, blue cheese, arugula, and horseradish aioli, with a side order of the roasted sweet potato salad.  And a soy latte because my sleep schedule is still not back to normal.

* My friend got The Farmer ($7) - a veggie option with zucchini, yellow squash, portobello, fresh herbs, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, grilled sweet potato with a side order of the creamy potato salad. 

Even with so many people there at prime lunch hour, we were still able to be seated pretty quickly. Drinks and silverware got to us in no time.

VERDICT ON FOOD
----------------------------
* The cut of the beef, the quality of the bread, the onions, cheese, and man, the horseradish aioli: this was definitely one of better roast beef sandwiches I've ever had. I'm craving it right now, in fact. Also really enjoyed the sweet potato salad and the soy latte which was very nicely done. My friend was also mightily impressed with The Farmer. I had a bite and it was pretty tasty and, also importantly, fairly hearty for being a full-on veggie sandwich. As for the sweeter side of the meal, we opted to wait till we got to Agritopia before pondering on the meaning of dessert.

VERDICT ON SERVICE
--------------------------------
Impressed. I don't think I've had such good, constant, and friendly service in a really long time - and this isn't even a full-service restaurant. Everyone (we interacted with at least 5 people) was spot on and professional while still exuding a good deal of warmth. I was a little taken aback by that - especially given that I'm slowly acclimating myself back to life in Arizona after dining in Jersey and NY restaurants for so long. But the staff here definitely know how to make patrons feel welcome and enjoy their time there, especially given this is a pretty casual place to eat in with no actual waitstaff. 

IN THE END
-----------------
For what the place is, a fast-casual restaurant in heart of old Gilbert, Liberty Market definitely is a gem. A lot of fresh and great-quality ingredients, a unique atmosphere not really replicated elsewhere in the Valley, a wide array of menu items for all three meals of the day (including gluten-free), a sleek and spotless interior, great looking food being cooked or in the display cases, and a great, professional  staff - I really had no complaints. Well, apart from it being a billion miles away, but I'll get over it. It was worth the drive.

4 stars for now - easily will give 5 once I've eaten bfast or dinner there. Great job, Joe. I'm definitely a fan.

Gilbert. Who knew?"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere, really busy early hours. They have a few vegan options which is great. The portion sizes are a tad inconsistent but they have a little bit for everyone."}
{"text":"I like breakfast here. The American standard is what I always go for. They have a coffee bar that makes pretty good lattes. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday be prepared to wait at least 30-45 minutes in line to order. Breakfast ends at 11 so makes sure you're there by 10. It's right by the Gilbert farmers market so there is a lot of foot traffic around on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my wife, overall it's an outstanding place. Food was amazing and customer service was incredible. This will be our first of many visits."}
{"text":"My first stop on my move back to Gilbert from SoCal. Heard downtown had some nice restaurants so I wandered into Liberty Market. 

I loved what they have done! On par to what San Diego would have in its Gas Lamp or Little Italy districts. I selected the Salmon BLT and a Moscow Mule. 

The Sandwich was delicious but did not care for the enormous sesame bun. Literally the bun could handle a pound of cooked hamburger patty with all the fixings. Taste, wonderful but got full too quick on the bread. Came with kettle chips which were perfect!

The mule... I'm no expert but I've had my fair share. Should not be served with a glass low boy. Needs to be in a copper cup with big blocks of ice. The pebbled ice is great for soft drinks but not for a mule. My opinion and will gladly admit if I am wrong. Like I said, I'm no expert. 

I think it's a good solid first impression and. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when guests are in town. It has always gotten great reviews from us and the prices are just right for what you get. Good service, fresh food, and a fun place to be in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years 1-2 weekends a month for breakfast.  We love it.  Food is always prepared correctly and has great flavor.  Coffee is top notch.  I would recommend that you arrive before 8:15am on the weekend if you do not want to wait in a line.

Iced Cortado with an additional shot is a awesome coffee drink."}
{"text":"I went to Liberty for the first time a couple of years ago.  One of my co-workers raved about it and said that, since it was my birthday, I should check it out and get my $10 off.  I have gone back monthly, at least...and every year on my birthday.  It is totally different from any other restaurant here in AZ and the food is so fresh and delish!

It's a little pricey (or I would go more often) and the line can get a bit out of hand.  If you aren't in a rush and have some extra $$$ to spend then try their breakfast or lunch.  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The baristas here do a great job of making specialty coffees. I'm attaching a pic of my vanilla latte. Made to perfection. My new favorite espresso place. And the food is good here too."}
{"text":"I like this place. It is fun, hip and the decor is welcoming. 
The food is above average, but some things are a bit pricey.
The portions are plentiful, and the staff is efficient.
In the past, I have had a few different breakfast items on their menu and always good.
This time I had the Liberty potatoes and turkey maple sausage. Usually the potatoes are deelish... this time a bit salty- but that is not the norm for this place.
It's a good group place, but can get really really busy!"}
{"text":"I'm here often - usually for coffee.  So while I recognize I've got a little 'local bias' in me, I have no problem noting things I don't love.

Liberty Market is a just a great joint.  It really deserves credit for planting the first flag in the name of the blossoming downtown Gilbert foodie movement.  

My kids used to tell me they liked going to Liberty because their bathrooms were awesome.  They're right of course, but the food is pretty good too.  :)

To the coffee...   Like many others I am sure, I can rate my liveliness (if not likeability) each day on a scale of  'BC / AC' - Before Coffee / After Coffee.  Liberty definitely has the best coffee bar in the area - and their stock brew is Portland's Stumptown!  You can't go wrong with any of the coffee bar choices, but the Ca Phe (Vietnamese) and Cortadito / Cortado (Cuban micro) are favorites, as is the simple French Press.  

Liberty always has a super assortment of pastries to choose from, should thy tooth be feeling sweeter than thy coffee.  They do a great job of keeping some favorites while always adding new treats to try.  I don't have a big sweet tooth, but I've enjoyed the innovative griddled bread pudding and like their bisuity scones - especially vanilla with coffee.  My kids go bonkers for the Salt River Bars.  

The pizza is on par overall with Grimaldi's, which the only pizza@chain I really love.  I'd rate them pretty equally because Liberty has more specialty choices.  To me, the crust at Liberty (and Grimaldi's) is spot-on perfect and they use fresh mozzarella to boot.  The perfect pizza crust should be chewy, with a crunchy, crusty tooth.  Also, you shouldn't have to wait 5-10 mintues for an inch thick of liquid hot magma cheese to cool before you dig in and then later wonder whether you'll be able to digest it - which is a problem with typical pizza place pizza.  A real pizza is spectacular right out of the fiery, burning furnace and thrown on your table.  That first 5-10 (10 is pushing it) is the window when a pizza is more than just a 'pizza.'   It becomes more and more mundane after 5 minutes.  

Don't Yelp-punch me if you're from the Midwest and are screaming about Lou Malnati's or the like.  That is a savory pie.  It can be very delicious.  But it isn't pizza.  

Hey, I didn't make the Rules della Pizza.  

Naples did.

The sandwiches at Liberty are very good.  My favorites are the Farmer Press and the Turkey Brie.  However, the cold-case sides feel 'hit or miss' in my opinion (since Liberty has high standards).  My advice is to find one you like and keep going back to that well.  The burgers are outstanding, although I only eat a couple a year.  Liberty always has some really creative specialty burgers that are worth checking out if you are a carnivore.

The fish dinners, especially the specials, are worth their price.  Gourmet restaurant quality with great sides (I can never get enough cauliflower mash) and special sauces.

I used to have some gripes about Liberty breakfast - not that it was bad, just that you had few alternatives to biscuits and greasy potatoes.  I think the Liberty Potatoes have way too much cheese, but I'm sure some may disagree.  It used to bug me you could not get eggs made to order - but they appear to have changed that policy.  In fact, I had over-easy eggs (opposed to sunnies) yesterday.....

....which brings me to ending this review with my favorite item on the current menu - the chilaquiles.  They are absolutely fantastic.  Salsa pequin, one of the salsas they pour over the dish, is one of my favorite Mexican salsas (tomatoes and tomatillos both, for a tangy and earthy spice).  Liberty does the chilaquiles as well as they can be done, period.  

The net-net recap - Liberty is a great choice for almost any taste.  It gets a 5 star review from me in part for that - but also for having some items that nobody nearby really does better - coffee, pizza, fish - and now chilaquiles.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had a burger and humus. I also had some of their baked fries. They were outstanding.

I recommend this palce. Five stars for sure.

Make sure to grab a menu before you hop in line so you know what you want before you get to the register.

Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"We ventured to downtown Gilbert for a double date and stopped at Liberty Market for dinner and really enjoyed our experience!

Food (4/5)
The majority of dishes we tried at Liberty Market were scrumptious. We started with the Buffalo Fingerling Fries which were thick cut steak fries with cheesy buffalo chicken topping. Divine! For dinner we shared the Italia salad with chicken and the Salmon BLT with a side of pasta salad. The Salmon BLT was perfect! Large, smoky, and complete with crispy bacon and huge ripe tomatoes. The pasta salad side was also very nice and light. The Italia salad was just okay. Honestly nothing special and it lacked flavor. 

Service (3/5)
The concept on Friday nights is to order at the counter and then have all your food and drinks brought to your table based on your table number. Everything came out on time but we rarely had someone stop by to clear empty plates. We also ordered another round of drinks and they brought the bill before the drinks came. Then we put our credit card and never saw a waiter again. I eventually just went up to the counter to get our card run. 

Ambiance (5/5)
The restaurant is cool and modern. There is an open air kitchen for the pizza station and the main kitchen is surrounded by glass so you can see in as you walk by. I always love these open air concepts as I believe it ensures your food is fresh! They also have a nice patio with lovely views of Downtown Gilbert. 

I am definitely open to trying Liberty Market again in the future, especially for brunch!"}
{"text":"Now that I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here I feel qualified to comment. I'm giving them a firm 3.5 stars.

I was really wowed by breakfast (working breakfast - always fun anyway). They make these amazing breakfast potatoes that, well ... Jim W and Abby W would have gone nuts over.

Then came dinner with fellow Yelpers Marian and Kevin H. It was a really enjoyable dinner. Jim W and I split a burger and a chicken pizza. The company was terrific and the only dark spot on the evening was when the woman at the counter informed me that they don't make grilled onions for their burgers. I was really surprised by a place of this quality not offering cooked onions as a burger option.

Last came my lunch meeting and the reason I've downgraded Liberty Market half a star. I was debating between the chicken sandwich and egg salad when I happened to notice that they offered caramelized onions on one of the sandwiches. Suddenly the burger appeared to be a viable option. Here's how that went:

me: \"I'd like the tower burger - medium - with cheddar, bacon and caramelized onions.\"

her: \"We don't have caramelized onions.\"

me: \"They're on the menu for the rancher.\"

her: \"That's at another counter.\"

me: \"I beg your pardon?\"

her: \"That's at a different counter.\" (this time with a bit of attitude)

3rd employee at bar: (under her breath) \"We can do that.\"

her: (after glare at 3rd employee) \"They'll be cold. They're for a cold sandwich.\"

3rd employee at bar: (slightly louder this time) \"We can heat them up.\"

When the burger arrived there were no onions to be seen. 3rd employee happened to be the one who brought the food and when I pointed that out to her the irritation was apparent. She looked at me, as sincerely as she could, and told me that she would have them heated and out to me as soon as possible.

Now, I have to say that the tower burger is absolutely fantastic with caramelized onions and they should ALWAYS offer it that way. Once I had my burger the way I wanted it I really enjoyed the meal. But, seriously, it's at another counter?! I can't imagine anyone refusing to walk ten feet to make a customer happy. Hopefully, they've gotten over that."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. I ordered the grilled sausage pizza made with the local Shriner's sausage. My dining companion ordered the Italia sandwich. We ordered at the counter and found the prefect table outside on the patio. The food took a few minuets to arrive, but it was fantastic. The pizza had a thin crust and very flavorful toppings. The sandwich was pressed and had an interesting sweet aftertaste we could not figure out. 
The atmosphere was great and they obviously allow pets on the patio as there were a few dining with their owners. 
I will be back and I will be bringing my big goofy puppy!"}
{"text":"After talking to the GM (and being told that what we experienced was an enigma) we decided to head back to liberty market and give it another try. 
We went for a late lunch/early dinner. We decided to share the tower burger with bacon on it with a side of Caprese Pasta Salad. I should add that we share meals all the time. That way we don't have left overs to bring home and we don't over eat. 
The burger with the garlic aioli was SOOO GOOD!! The pineapple salsa was also pretty great. I usually don't like that kind of topping but it was definitely an awesome additive to the burger. 
The pasta salad was so fresh. It tasted like it was all picked out of the garden rift before it was made. 
My only complaint is the amount of food you get for the price you are paying. We got a burger, the salad, and a fountain drink for $17. Usually that's right around what we pay for that but we leave full. Today we were both still hungry. If we got bigger portions, this restaurant would be 5+ stars. The chefs really know what they are doing when it comes to what they put in their food. 
Definitely going back!! I have heard the salt river bars are to die for and I need to get my hands on one!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market has a refreshing vibe in the atmosphere, and they also have really fresh food! We came here on a Sunday evening, and it wasn't too busy. Ordered the supreme pizza and was surprised to see that it has large, fresh tasting toppings on it. Normally when you get a supreme pizza, you think the sausages are going to be small, but these ones were large slices filled with flavor. My sister ordered the salmon BLT and it was grilled to perfection. 

The restaurant pays homage to the history of when it used to just be a market, and has an old school feel to it when you first walk in. But when you get to the dining area, you soon realize that it's a cool mesh of history and modern/urban decor. They also have a coffee bar inside--that I still need to try! 

There is indoor seating and outdoor patio seating--which is definitely more romantic. So if you're looking for a place for date night in downtown Gilbert, Liberty Market won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I was excited to stop in and finally try the famous doissants (doughnut/croissant hybrid) that they make every Tuesday. I had pretty high hopes after seeing the coconut cream flavor they made this week but was sadly disappointed. Flavor was okay, but the actual doughnut wasn't the flaky delicate pastry I expected. I also tried a few French macarons since they are my favorite. I never knew they sold them at Liberty market. Probably the worst I've ever had. So dry and hard as a rock. Everything was also overpriced. Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overall, I had a good experience here tonight catching up with a girlfriend over dinner and some wine. I had the meatball Liberty Pasta Bowl and drank the pinot grigio. It tasted nice, but I think the menu could have maybe benefitted from perhaps a better seafood selection or a greater selection of pasta choices for the trendy, cafeteria style it focuses on. I found myself wanting a shrimp pasta dish, after I finally got to the counter and saw the chef special was shrimp enchiladas. All in all, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We have come here for breakfast in the past, and it has always been good, so we decided to come in for dinner on my husband's birthday.  The service was fabulous, hence the 3 star review.  The staff was kind and attentive, and that was really awesome.

The food, however, was another story.  We ordered the fingerling potato fries for an appetizer.  They were basically raw and crunchy when they came out.  They were covered in sour cream, almost as if that could mask the taste and texture.  Yuck!  My hubby and I ordered a $16 steak sandwich, which had so much horseradish mayo on it, it was inedible.  We didn't finish it.  My kids ordered pizzas, and one of them came out burned.  They offered to remake it, but that would have meant that one child sat around with no food and watched while the others ate.  The meal was $50 for three entrees and an appetizer.  We don't eat out much.  That's a big price for us to swallow, especially since most of the food was thrown away.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. The only thing I would recommend is charging $5 for the sangria instead of $7. The glass is small and full of ice. Come on, guys."}
{"text":"There is something about their sweet potatoes-amazing! I love their sides of sweet potato salad more than their entrees, and their entrees are delicious. Their sweet potato muffin is the best muffin I've ever had. It's pretty sugary but that could be why I like it so much :)

Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Consistently great. Everyone is so nice and helpful. Had to update to 5 stars. Thanks for great service always!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Food was tasty and their coffee wasn't too shabby either.  I wish they had more outside seating.  This would be a great place to hang out on a warm Sunday drinking a few beers munching on some munchies and enjoying the sun while catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Thank you for offering vegan options. 
I was surprised to see Liberty Market cooks their potatoes with cheese - make sure you read fine print on the bottom of the menu. 
 Hope to see more vegan options here in the future."}
{"text":"We always see the lines out front and thought the place would be great. It was truly a disappointment. Our shrimp and grits was disgusting and we returned it.  It was nothing more than cold lumpy grits with some oily mini salad shrimp or on top of it. It is one of the worst things I have ever been served, clearly something bad happened here. The antipasta plate was okay although the salami was old and gamey.  The toasted Brie and sausage were ok. The Mac and cheese was above average but not great. The decor was nice and the service attentive.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place for a very long time, and decided to give it a try. It certainly lives up to the hype I've heard.

I got the \"Best Chicken Sandwich\" and decided to upgrade from the chips. The sandwich was excellent, moist chicken breast, spicy avocado & chipolte vinaigrette providing amazing flavors! I asked for the much talked about roasted sweet potatoe salad, but had to exchange it. It had pecans in it, and I'm allergic. I switched and got the chilled caprese pasta salad. Was a good offering, but wish it had a bit more flavor kick.

I'd certainly recommemd checking them out!"}
{"text":"The Capresé Salad is my favorite. The pizzas are good too. Oh, and the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"I have been to Liberty Market multiple times for Brunch/Breakfast, they are decently priced, and the food has never been a disappointment. The coffee at Liberty Market it made very well, the barista program is fantastic, I have yet to be let down. The Cuban Latte A.K.K Cortado is fantastic, and you can never go wrong with a double shot of Stumptown® espresso.

During brunch, Liberty Market does offer a variety of cocktails including Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, and Irish coffees all of which will set you back approximately 8$. 

Every time I have been to Liberty Market there has been a line, don't let that detour you from eating here, the turnaround if very fast (especially in Downtown Gilbert) typical wait is between 10 - 18 minutes."}
{"text":"Not the most efficient way to get your food.  You stand in line to order, then find a table.  Sometimes they are helpful with this task.  The problem is that nobody \"owns\" your table so there is nobody really taking care of you and it shows.  I've been there several times when they are busy and when they are not.  It's a crapshoot whether you get your drinks before your meal or if you get the right items.  Asking for refils or to-go boxes will task your patience as they usually forget.  Food is pretty good though.  They just need to fix the front of the house."}
{"text":"Grew up in Phoenix but spent the last 10 years in LA where my food expectations have skyrocketed. I thought this place would still offer viable competition but the food was just okay. I think it's perfect for the audience so it's smart business making but nothing really exciting or original is going on here. They've stuck  to the basics and do well so can't fault them for that. 

Desserts are strong. The Salted River bar and the fruit tart were delicious."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place or the owners. My 1st time at Liberty Market, my friend and I ended up chatting with the owners (Kiersten and David) for a short while before eating. On our next visit, weeks later, they remembered us AND our names. Impressive. Not only that, we came in as they were closing and they still accommodated us. Talk about service. 

Every single thing I've ordered from their menu has been amazing. The pizzas are really great, especially the White pizza. The Italia salad is also delicious. Portions are big, sharing is caring my friends.

Side note: Make sure to check out the bathrooms. Each stall has a different theme and music to go along with it. We made sure to lock ourselves in each and every stall to get the full experience."}
{"text":"I came on my birthday and got a free dessert. I got an ice team sandwich larger than my hand. It was delicious. It was 2 cookies and between them was ice cream and the sides of the sandwich has nuts. Yum! I recommend them!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive for what you get.  Very loud place to eat. i would like to hear the person across from my just a bit.  Eating in silence isn't my thing. Bring headphones to drown out the noise.  The food is good don't get me wrong."}
{"text":"Love coming here - I've never had anything bad, ever. And just discovered that there are journals by the bar to peruse and write in. How cool is that? Today - Hawaiian pizza with lemon berry bar. Super tasty. I'd take a picture but I ate it too fast!"}
{"text":"First time here. Every staff member we talked to was attentive and friendly. For 6:30 at night busy but we found a table quickly and it was very comfortable. We had Apricot Chicken, Ahi Tuna, 2 pizzas, a Chef special with prosciutto and Figs and a Supreme. My husband got a side salad and didn't ask about the dressing when ordering. He didn't like the vinaigrette  (I Did!) So they happily remade it with ranch for him even though it was not their mistake. Hands down the table favorite was the chicken but all meals were awesome! Hubs thought the Wasabi was a little strong in the mashed potatoes with the ahi but still really enjoyed his meal. Bread pudding was great. I also had a nice Pinot Noir with my meal. Spoke to David on the way out. Extremely friendly & genuine guy! We can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I've been told by someone I respect that one star isn't fair. After a month of thought, I've decided she's right. But for this meal, in this restaurant, 2 stars is as high as I can go.

Liberty Market has graciously offered to refund my meal. Thank you. But as I ate it, and didn't say anything that morning, it's on me."}
{"text":"Staff, food, and experience is awesome. It's a trendy restaurant that's laid out like a market. There's a small coffee bar in the corner that's adorable and makes great drinks. The food is awesome. I've tried a lot of different items on the menu and they're all amazing but you should really come for dessert. Splitting an entree so you can get one (or two) of Liberty's giant desserts is becoming my new strategy. Love coming here."}
{"text":"I've tried many items on the Liberty Market menu, and my go-to favorite is the white pizza (I substitute basil for the arugula), hands down the best item on the menu. They have great rotating specials that change weekly, keep an eye on the burger special and the bread pudding special! Their bread pudding is the best in town. Staff is consistently friendly and food rarely takes longer than 10 minutes to arrive. Liberty Market is a Gilbert gem!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Liberty Market and  I was not disappointed. You order at a deli counter and as we moved through the line, we convinced each other to get a slice of their carrot and red velvet cakes since we were going to be yelping, we just had to try desert too! The display cases showcased all the delicious, pastries, cakes, and salads and I like the fact you can watch the cooks make all the sandwiches, flatbread pizza, etc right in front of you. The slices of cake were huge and with the extra calories. I had the egg salad sandwich and out was simple and delicious. My favorite part was the bread, so fresh and delicious. I've had so many chicken and egg salads that are over flavored, but this one was just right. So good and next time I'd love to try their breakfast and espresso."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Liberty Market, I stood in line for 15 minutes until my self-diagnosed adult ADHD kicked in and I had to leave without ordering. I bookmarked it in my mind, though, as they had Tobin James on their wine list and the brick oven kicked just enough warmth to trigger nostalgia of childhood winter time. Anywho... I returned a year later and was not disappointed! The line was long, but moved fast! And, they save ya a seat while you're placing your order and settling the tab. This is now a place we visit every week or two. 

My go-to sandwich order is the Cubano, of course. The side choices are homemade and the sweet potato salad is a favorite. Their \"Best Chicken\" is up there, too. Their Italian Wedding Soup, which was a weekly special, was the best I'd had. If you have room for dessert, I recommend the carrot cake. 

This is also a sweet spot for coffee, but that's not what they're known for."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast.  Saturday mornings before hitting the farmers market down the street is so much fun.  I usually just get eggs but had to try the turkey sausage from my hubbys demi bkfast.  So good, I mean soo darn good."}
{"text":"I haven't made up my mind about this place.  I stopped in tonight after reading other reviews and left thinking it's definitely a mixed bag.

The menu is varied and exciting but words can sound much better than something tastes.  I had the Tower Burger with bacon and blue cheese and it was great (a little too much blue cheese, I had to scrape most off to taste actual burger).  This was accompanied by sides of caprese pasta, which was excellent (I loved the tiny mozzarella balls), and the garlic smashed potatoes that were dry and only hinted at a garlic component.  Another Yelper's raves led me to try the bread pudding which I can best describe as 3\" of cool whipped cream on top of 2\" of warmed bread pudding on top of 1\" of seriously undercooked egg and bread bits.  Yeah, is-it-raw?-kinda-undercooked.  Still trying to get the taste out of my mouth.

The service...was nice at the counter, spotty and freaky everywhere else.  I was offered and chose to \"have my dessert later\" and was told that I \"could let them know anytime when I wanted it.\"  However, the [blur of a] staff doesn't stop at tables unless they're dropping off food or clearing it away.  So I venture up to the counter to inquire about my pudding and literally get accosted by a woman who starts following me like a rent-a-cop and *shouting* 'SIR!  SIR!  DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?!  SIR, DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?!'  Seriously, my first thought is 'who the hell is this woman?'  Ah, apparently some sort of manager.  Not the best demeanor to approach and address customers.  A few minutes later as I'm eating my pudding and thoroughly engrossed in reading something, the same voice begins *shouting* again from ten feet away, 'HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR PUDDING?!'  and repeats herself because my look upward isn't to respond but to see who's being addressed and why is someone shouting at them?

Overall, I was not impressed by the staff.

I do plan on returning one more time in the future, only because the menu is so intriguing that I am curious to see if some other entree can be tasty enough to overcome the faults in this first visit."}
{"text":"Eat at Joes! This place, owned by Joe from Joe's Barbecue and Joe's Farm Grill lives up to the hype. I'm very picky where I choose to eat (never a TGIFriday's, Applebee's, etc) so I got this recommendation a few months back from Yelp. Boy is this different for Gilbert. Imagine, food that is delivered in a modern eclectic manner, served fast and at a very reasonable price. That's what you'll get at Liberty Market. I've eaten there 5 or 6 times now as we live just down the street. I can say for certain 2 things: 1. You can't out dress Joe... he's always the most fashionable in the room. 2. You will not be disappointed if you appreciate great tasting food served in a vibrant atmosphere. Joe: Kudos for bringing somethig different to the EV!"}
{"text":"Whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner, this is the best place to eat in Gilbert. Hands down."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a solid option as it has a lot of menu items that appeal to different people. I've been here for all meals of the day (breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner) and always found something that sounded good. Their specials are usually pretty inventive and even the basics are done really well. Burger Daze is one of the best promotions around, I'll usually stop in a few days out of the month to try a burger that sounds particularly good. The staff has always been really friendly and helpful, and they are able to send food out relatively quickly compared to how busy it usually is. Out of all the options in downtown Gilbert, Liberty Market is one of the more appealing and dependable ones."}
{"text":"What can I say? Like the rest of joes restaurants, this place is great! Keep them coming Joe!"}
{"text":"I was fully expecting a wait on a Saturday night but standing in line for over an hour just order, then wait for our food was a little much.The experience was a cross between waiting in line for concert tickets and going through the lunch line in the loud crowded high school cafeteria. Food was good but definitely not worth the wait. I recommend the food but not the experience."}
{"text":"Cool, trendy place. Tasty food. The sandwiches are small, so they leave room for their amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Usually fantastic, but disappointing for takeout the day after Thanksgiving.  My salad was mushy (congealed) and obviously made \"several\" days prior.  They also forgot part of our order."}
{"text":"I think reading all the reviews on Yelp made me over anticipate this place. I got there bright and early with my husband to beat the crowd (as a matter of fact I was the first in line at 6:55am and by the 7am opening there was 6 people behind us). The order process is much like Jason Deli, which I like because once you're done with your food you can leave without having to wait around for the bill. I ordered the Western Scramble, I was a little sad I couldn't substitute the biscuit for a pancake, but oh well. It also came with the \"Liberty Potatoes\" which were a little too greasy for my taste, the scramble was okay. My husband had the Sicilian Scramble and loved it, he ate everything on the plate.  The Hot Chocolate was better than I thought it would be, I ordered the largest size which is literally served in a \"bowl\" so my butterfingered friends please beware. I can see myself trying this place again, a little on the pricey side but not exorbitant. Next time I'll try the Grilled Bread Pudding."}
{"text":"The food is great. Service is terrible. I called and reserved the communal table for my little sisters bridal shower dinner, we show up, they seat us, everything's great. Then Julie, a manager, maybe, (if she is, she shouldn't be) comes over and tells us we need to move, that it was booked for another party and can't find our reservation. Then she comes back and tells us that they have our reservation, but it was 'on the back of the paper, and didn't see it' in the most condescending tone ever. So it's their mistake taking the reservation, then seating us before they asked a name, so that's on them too, and we have to compensate for their communication failure and move? We have to sit at a table where we are 'together'(not together), had to get up and order, then doesn't even offer to discount our meal or drinks, or give us a dessert or anything to show their appreciation for us fixing their mistake. Just a 'thanks for understanding' with a frown smile from Julie while she swipes my credit card for a $250 bill. I've never been treated so poorly by restaurant staff. Ever. I love the food at liberty, but will never come back.

Update. I got steak, medium rare, we waited 35 minutes for food, mine was cold and gross. Chimichurri doesn't taste like that. They refunded my steak but charged me for my drink. After seating us. Then moving us. Then forgetting to bring out food out."}
{"text":"Place is right up my alley.  Will definitely be returning with friends."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere! I love the concept of ordering your food, paying for it, and then having it brought to your table! The food was amazing and it was hard nailing down one thing to get! I got the tower burger - amazing (added cado and bacon - duh).  I highly recommend the whipped sweet potatoes - to die for!! Top it off with their ice cream cookie! It's the size of your face:)"}
{"text":"Amazing Salmon sandwich - ask for extra side of sauce, Awesome breakfast - their pancakes are unique and so FULL of flavor! Even their honey yogurt was amazing.  Have not had a single bad dish EVER at this restaraunt.  

The chef has even come out and asked how things were going! Super friendly staff, and if ever a long line it is worth the wait!  Just got noted one of the best restaraunts in the Phoenix magazine."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time for breakfast on my birthday.  I was pleasantly surprised by all the vegetarian/vegan options on the menu.  The restaurant is very nice with a classic exterior, modern interior, and great patio .  I was a bit confused where to order, but it could have been my need for coffee.  The staff here are really cheerful and very helpful.  You even get a discount for your birthday which they happily pointed out when she asked how my day was going.  I had the Chilaquiles with vegetables and I was completely impressed one of my top five breakfast foods to get out now.  It's spicy, crunchy, and breakfast all in one awesome plate. I might be the only person to have never tired Chilaquiles before in Arizona, but no longer.  I even got an oatmeal cookie pie for the road.  Which I also highly recommend.  I have only been here once, but I can't wait to go back.  

TRY:
- Chilaquiles with vegetables
- Oatmeal pie Cookie"}
{"text":"Good place to try at least once. In my opinion it's not worth waiting an hour just to eat, but it's a very nice atmosphere. By the time you order at the counter the wait isn't too long for the food to artive, but the line is usually out the door around lunch time."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every time I go here I love what I order.  I love the salmon BLT. Great atmosphere, and reasonably priced.  One of our favorite spots to eat out."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious.  Make sure you try the egg salad sandwich and vegetarian pizza!  Service is sketchy sometimes but otherwise worth the wait."}
{"text":"We had the best scallops and angel hair pasta with asparagus and just the right amount of bite to it.  We love this place.  We also love sitting on the patio.  We have also had fish and also spaghetti and meatballs and everything has been awesome."}
{"text":"As recent transplants to the desert, my boyfriend and I have been...well, largely disappointed with most of the restaurants we have tried so far in the area.  We would get excited about a place we found, and then...meh.  That is, until we found Liberty Market. 

 Although I'm not the biggest fan of the \"order at the counter, then find your table\" model, Liberty has it organized really well.  Our first time, the line was really long and I thought it was going to be a huge wait.  It turns out that there is a hostess type who reserves a table for you while you are in line, and then by the time you order your food your table is ready.  The line moves fairly quickly too.

They have a nice sized menu - big enough that you have a nice selection, but small enough to not be ridiculous or overwhelming.  And as a former Portlandian, can I say how happy I am that they serve Stumptown Coffee?  The pot of French Press gives me warm fuzzies.  All of the food we have had there has been excellent.  I really love the biscuits.  

The atmosphere is sort of cafeteria-like, but not in a bad way.  I love that it is in an old market and has some character - soooo tired of everything being in a strip mall.  The little area of downtown Gilbert that it is located in is adorable.

Oh, and the service is great.  Despite not having a dedicated server, there are always people walking by who are checking on you, and ready to bring you something and take away empty plates.  Everyone who works there has been really nice.

Thank you Liberty Market, for giving me some hope that I can find sustenance in the desert!"}
{"text":"By far my wife and I's favorite place in the valley. We usually split a pizza, salad, and a couple sides/appetizers and can get out of there for ~$30. Every place we go we ask ourselves \"Was this as good as Liberty?\" Each time the answer is \"No\" and it's more expensive than Liberty. 

I've yet to get a bad meal at Liberty, we love everything and always get a side of balsamic vinaigrette, not reduction, to dip our pizza crusts and it's the best. We also get the rice pudding at the beginning of the meal, it's like dessert for an appetizer, which is always a good idea on my book. We love this place and will continue going back as long as we live in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that you can walk in, order just about anything on the menu, and it will be totally delicious.  This place isn't huge and it's nothing fancy.  It will get busy on weekends, but don't let the long line you will need to stand in deter you.  The employees are very efficient and they keep things moving quickly.  For a light lunch, I highly recommend the chopped salad.  It doesn't sound overly creative or like anything special, but this is very tasty!  The addition of the pumpkin seed brittle to this salad pairs well with the greens and the dried apricots.  For dessert, you must try the salt river bars or the sweet potato muffins.  As a matter of fact, all of their desserts are pretty spectacular. Liberty Market is your best bet for lunching out on a nice afternoon in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Great food and a funky vibe. It's always crowded. I wish they took your order at your table, but the long line to order is worth the wait. Their patio is pet friendly which is awesome! If you go you have to try their homemade ice cream sandwich! Oh and their blueberry pancakes :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, unique options, but kind of pricy for portion size. Always crowded, which is a testament to good food, but annoying to find a table."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times in the past 2 months since recently moving to Gilbert. The food is delicious and I like how they always have some daily specials. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. We have only sat inside but they do have a cute little outside patio area. Great place to get some really good salads, sandwiches, pizza or burgers!

The bathrooms are a little strange as the mens and women's are all in one place and they are unisex. Makes it a little weird to be going to the restroom next to someone of the opposite gender. Overall a great experience though!"}
{"text":"TRY THE PANCAKES! No, seriously, if you are looking to taste what are quite possibly the best pancakes I have ever had in my life (and trust, I've had many) visit this spot and order chocolate chip pancakes! The batter is eggy and delicious, the cakes come out to you swimming in buttery deliciousness and are light and filling. These bad boys remind me a little of german pancakes, I'm a HUGE fan! (can you tell?)

Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest I'll fill you in on a few other things. This spot isn't your typical sit down, order and eat spot. First you will stand in a line to order your food, then you will be seated and your food will make its way to you.They serve a variety of options here and have a monster sized cinnamon roll that could feed a small army. I once ordered the chilaquiles, which were good but a little more spicy than I like. Beverages are served cafeteria style so you fill and refill your own. My kids had macaroons for dessert one day and like a good mom I snuck  taste, they were very good and compared strongly to those served at Bottega Louie in LA, although their size was considerably larger! I love that they also have a take out counter that serves good coffee drinks and sells whole bean stump town coffee. Service was fast and good. Will definitely be back for pancakes and coffee!  ...I may even try a pizza!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants.  I had the Maiden Lane sandwich (pressed) and the Roasted Sweet Potato Salad as my side.  Both were amazing, but my only complaint is that they went a little heavy on the horseradish spread.  Next time I'll ask them to lighten up.

My husband ordered a burger and potato salad.  He said the burger was amazing, but the potato salad was terrible (I agree, it was so bland).

What I didn't like:  I was really bummed that they were out of the local beer I wanted to try.  And I can't say I'm a big fan of the ordering system and getting my own drinks.  I'm tipping to have them bring my plate and seat me?

Overall, loved the restaurant and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Quick update to my Liberty Market review. On my review, I was critical of the breakfasts there and my words I believe were \"it falls flat\". Well, I still haven't been back to give Liberty Market a second review but I felt compelled to write this update when I received an email from Joe. Yes, THE JOE! He noted my comments on the breakfast menu and stated that he is having discussions with the staff regarding breakfasts.

In my opinion, when an establishment actually takes the time to listen to it's customers, respond to them and take action, that reflects a genuine desire to please said customers! My response?

I'm grabbing my keys, firing up the engine and heading to LIBERTY MARKET!!

(breakfast review forthcoming...)

{"text":"We've been here a couple times now and we've loved each time we went. The atmosphere is very casual and informal. We love that they use ingredients sourced from local businesses, one of which as we found out, is a business that is in my family.  It's right in the middle of downtown Gilbert among many other restaurants and it definitely gets a good share of customers.  The food is excellent. Sometimes the service gets a bit slow when they are busy, which is often - and you may need to be patient for your order but be sure it will be up to par. So if it's busy, don't go to Liberty thinking you'll be in and out - it's a slow, leisurely meal experience that is best enjoyed with family and friends where you are not rushed to get somewhere else.  It's a good environment to slow down, talk to loved ones, and relax."}
{"text":"I love this place!! We have probably over the years eaten just about everything off the menu. My personal favorite time to be at Liberty is for breakfast and the cinnamon rolls should be illegal (they are that good!) the barista service is top dollar and everything is heavenly. One of my top 5 favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Had a reat lunch there. Fresh ingredients and exceptionally friendly staff. A little loud for a quiet conversation but go for the food & service"}
{"text":"Great vibe to this place feeling much like a local coffee shop but perhaps a little less warm.  The menu is diverse and I love seeing local brews available.  The wood fired brick oven turns out great pizza and they have a great variety on their menu.  

This place is cafeteria style when ordering then they bring you your food.  Seating is rather uncomfortable which is one of the one dings I have for it other than the price which is a little on the high side considering the experience.  Regardless this is a great place with great food so do not shy away."}
{"text":"Truly as good as i gets.  Just went again this weekend (on a Sat); the line looked intimidating, but it went faster than I thought.  The older gentleman who works there (my husband and I have had a lovely conversation with him before) was there again handing out menus as guests entered and we had another lovely conversation with him - we asked about the 'E61' name and he gave us the history of the Faeme E61 espresso machine one of the owners had brought over from Milan.. what an interesting story.  Needless to say, the espressos we had were outstanding - super dark and rich crema. The great thing we learned is that you can walk right up to the 'E61 Bar' and order your food/drink w/out having to wait in the long line (that is KEY to know!). Both our breakfast dishes were highly filling and very flavorful (their steak scramble is very tasty and I really like their honey biscuit). When the staff is continually friendly and prompt and their food is repeatedly tasty and filling - you are darn near 'as good as it gets'."}
{"text":"Ordered The Tower Burger for my birthday, up to $10 value, just pay the difference if your food is greater than that.  Love the special sauces.  The burger was too big so I had to cut it in half.  It was super busy as well since it's on Thanksgiving weekend.  I didn't know I have to order first and get a seat so I was a bit confused there but good thing I was there with my friends and not by myself.  I live in North Scottsdale and it was worth the drive for me to drive all the way down to Downtown Gilbert.  Definitely coming back again soon."}
{"text":"First time at Liberty Market. Good portions and great taste. The atmosphere is good. Nice historic building with a lot of room inside and out. We may have found our go-to breakfast place."}
{"text":"Service left us a little lost being first timers, but the food was fresh and creative. Maybe it was the lack of hospitality that took away from the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never turned down an invitation to any of Joe Johnston's eateries, but Liberty Market is probably my favorite, for three main reasons:

#1 - they're open early, and serve beer. Just to be clear, I'm not an alcoholic in need of an eye opener. I work overnights, and Liberty is one of our staples for post-shift beers and delicious food. They have a decent craft beer selection and usually have Tower Station on hand, which is a serious plus. All of the breakfast choices are phenomenal, though the chorizo and sweet potato hash and breakfast burrito are my two favorites. Their pastry cake is also stocked full of tasty options as well - from big soft cinnamon rolls the size of your head to delicate macarons to buttery rich scones, you really can't go wrong. My old roommate swears by the salt river bars. My only complaint is that they previously had these AMAZING blackberry lemon bars, which aren't available anymore. I might just need to start a petition to bring them back. 

#2 - the Strada bar is fabulous and I'm completely addicted to their cortados. Except for Bergie's on the next block, there aren't many places in downtown Gilbert to get coffee this good. I love that they make their own nut milks; I feel like it gives your drink a little extra love.

#3 - most importantly, they have DOSSANTS on Tuesdays! You read that right - freaking donut croissant hybrids. It's a different flavor every week, though the best ones I've had were the maple bacon and the lemon meringue. More recently they had a cannoli one that completely blew my mind. Yep. Cannoli + donut + croissant = bliss. 

Other miscellaneous things that make Liberty Market so amazing: 
$10 free towards your bill on your birthday, just don't forget your ID. 
The bathrooms! They were all designed by a different staff member, so each has its own personality. I would definitely recommend checking them out.
Dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market!! The food, the atmosphere, the service, everything. Whether I'm eating in, picking up, or ordering delivery through DoorDash the quality of the food is always excellent. The people who work there always make me feel welcome, even when I'm eating alone. It's definitely one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"I don't know why Yelp describes this place as \"coffee and tea\" when it's a full blown restaurant/sandwich shop. My husband and I were passing through downtown Gilbert and their patio just looked too inviting to pass up. We split the Rancher and Farmer sandwiches and each got a beer. They really have a great beer selection. The sandwiches were delicious and huge. We each took some home and had a great late night snack after a Suns game later that day. The roasted vegetables on the Farmer tasted fresh and were still vibrantly colored. The Rancher was the perfect blend of bleu cheese, beef and horseradish. Even the sides were delicious. They should sell their bean and corn salad by the gallon. Even their pasta salad was filled with fresh tomatoes and basil as well as freshly made mozzarella pearls. 

The atmosphere of this place is also pretty great. The patio is simply decorated and naturally shaded by trees. I'd imagine it probably stays pretty nice even during the summer. The staff was beyond courteous as they answered my numerous questions about the menu and one of the cooks even came out to ask how we were enjoying our meal. 

I really can't wait until I have an excuse to go back. I've only lived in AZ for a couple of months but this might be my favorite place. I'm from Chicago so I have pretty high standards when it comes to restaurant patios and this place rivals some of my WIndy City favorites. Don't check this place out if you're in Gilbert; go to Gilbert to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Completely in love with this place! 

Great location in downtown Gilbert - the parking that is very close to the restaurant is a bit limited but there is a large lot about a block away. 

The restaurant feels vintagey and was a foodmarket years ago, so it is maintaining that feel but providing a modern/industrial look. I don't love the tables and chairs, definitely not the most plush but serviceable.

There is a counter - complete with a bakery case - where you place your order, When it is busy you have to wait in line and are assigned a table - during slower times you just sit wherever you'd like. 

The staff are all really nice and helpful.

The food is delicious. It is a bit expensive for a fairly casual place, but the quality makes it worthwhile. My favorite meal is breakfast - the demi breakfast, pancakes, and bakery items are all amazing, especially the blueberry scone! I always think of scones as being dry and not very flavorful, but theirs are exactly the opposite: moist and tasy, served with a ramekin of whipped sweetened cream. My husband and I always split one with our breakfast. 

Dinner is great, too - my \"go to\" is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb Marinade and Fresh Veggies, super good and a perfect portion ($19) Don't leave without dessert! The Red Velvet Cake or Ice Cream Sandwich are perfect to share (the ice cream sandwich is made with two big chocolate chip cookies and vanilla icecream, cut into quarters) If you're too full, get a Salt River Bar to go (Salty and Sweet gets me every time) 

They have some cool local beers. mimosas for brunch, and good coffee - their Peppermint Mocha (which is a seasonal Christmas drink) is my favorite.

Weird note: Don't miss the bathrooms - each bathroom has a different theme with decorations and a specialized soundtrack (farm, recipes, Tuscany). Very fun."}
{"text":"My father & I went to Liberty Market years ago but didn't end up staying because of a long wait time. This time though, when we walked in the front entrance, we were greeted and really liked the the vibe so we figured we would wait. It took only about half an hour to put in our order which was less than expected looking at the line. The best part was that even though we had to order prior to sitting, we were given a number with a designated table so we didn't need to worry about others holding tables, etc.

We ordered the Crab Cake Po Boy with a side of roasted sweet potato salad ($1 extra for the side as their sandwiches normally come with chips) & the Pancakes with blueberries ($1 extra for the blueberries). Everything came out quickly & it looked great!

The blueberry pancakes were really fluffy & delicious with an ample helping of blueberries in each pancake. I think it's a bit of hit or miss when it comes to pancakes but these were so spot on! The Crab Cake Po Boy was also delicious; the crab cakes themselves were really light and seasoned well. I also really liked the chipotle aioli that was served with it. The portion size of this sandwich was really large, way too big for one person to finish. The accompanying sweet potato salad was also so so good! The reason why we got it is because when we were walking through the line, we passed by a case that had all the cold sides ... tricky tricky!

The other items in the pastry case also looked really good. Now that we know how quickly they get through the line & how delicious the food is, we'll most likely be frequent visitors!!"}
{"text":"Food great, but this place is $$$$ and the wait is forever. It's quaint. But won't be back, there are no wait staff. You have to wait in line to order, then they bring out the food when ready. I HATE waiting, especially when I am just standing in line. Not the place for me."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. 

I have put this in my regular rotation for every time I'm in Gilbert.  They have great sandwiches, sides, and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service (my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great)... this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER, probably my fave burger I've had there.  I've also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese.  The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a highly experimental restaurant that has a long way to go.  My wife and I tried Liberty Market last December as a dinner and a show deal paired with the theatre next door.  The rain was pouring and as we dashed in the warmth of exposed rafters and good ambience reassured us we had made the right choice. That was where the fun ended.  For such a fancy looking place, the stand in line ordering was a little bit of a letdown.  We ordered a margherita pizza, unaware that the pizzas are barely a snack for a single person.  The pizza was good, though a little scorched, but the wood fired oven gave it a very nice artisinal touch.  We filled our drink cups at the oversized soda fountain and sat at a table that afforded a picture window view of Downtown Gilbert, and the feeling was cozy until the hardwood bench began to cramp my backside.  The food didn't take long to arrive, and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, if a little unnecessary. Apparently their only function is to serve the food and refill drinks, from the self serve fountain.  The real mystery came after our meal when we made our way past a very clean, completely empty kitchen.  It seemed extraneous, but must see more use during breakfast hours.  Then, arriving at the unisex washroom with highly decorated closet toilets providing little barrier between myself, my wife, and a fairly loud and smelly gentleman next to me, I was forced to flee screaming into the night.  I go back for the pizza, but only when my brain needs a little twisting."}
{"text":"Everything about Liberty Market is done right. Why don't we have one of these near me? My burger was cooked perfectly, I loved my dining companion's Salmon BLT, and the Salt River bars for dessert were superb.  I also tried a bite of the flank steak and thought it was really, really good.

I love that you stand in line, and once you order, they have a table for you. So much better than fighting people for table space."}
{"text":"I went in today mainly to get some research for an English assignment for school and to sample food. What I didn't expect was the experience that I had. First off, the staff is very friendly and very welcoming. They greet you with a smile and make you feel at home. When they take your order, if you don't order a drink they give you a complimentary water glass. Not a plastic cup like most other restaurants. This is a legit glass that they use for fountain drinks. They bring your food to your table and come back regularly to check on how you are doing. Then on the off chance that you get to meet Joe while you are in there, he is the definition of working patron. He checks up on everyone, customers and staff alike, and is always willing to answer questions. He was glad to sit down with me so I could interview him to get some background information on the information, and that alone made my experience amazing. I would recommend Liberty Market to ANYONE looking for great food and great people"}
{"text":"I got a piece of red velvet cake. The frosting is so rich and creamy with a very buttery finish and LOTS of cream cheese. The cake is tasty but dry. Good thing there was lots of amazing frosting to cover that flaw up. The place looked like a trendy spot you would find in NYC with prices to match. The staff was super friendly though."}
{"text":"Weekly Special dessert 1/3-1/4: Baked Alaska - Simply DELECTABLE!! 
If you get anything while at Liberty Market this weekend you must try the Baked Alaska. The yummy chocolate cake with the cherry ice-cream and the whipped topping is scrumptious. Well done guys, well done!"}
{"text":"First time I'm for dinner (we frequent lunch) and they had a kids menu! I hope it a not just a dinner option because I will visit even more regularly if I don't have to spend over $10 for my 7 year old to eat! Also, Goats du Rhone white wine blend is delish... Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  We were out with an old family friend in from Houston, and decided to give this a try for lunch.  Really tasty!  Our friend had some sort of pizza, which he said was good.  The crust was really hard, as it had been prepared earlier and then topped and warmed up.  Had to get a steak knife to cut thru it.
I had ( the Cuban) ham and cheese and purple cabbage pressed sandwich.  Very tasty.  My husband had what looked like a grilled cheese, but he said it was very good( Arizona Sky) He was particularly impressed with the Aioli, said it was very good.
Overall, we will try it again.  Hopefully it won't be so busy next time and we can actually carry on a conversation while eating without yelling :)"}
{"text":"I will start of by saying this is my second time here and I have been extremely satisfied both times I have been here. 

For a holiday weekend the wait was not bad at all. At most 30 minutes. I expected that going there so it was no surprise to me. 

We ordered the sweet potatoes hash, the Italian grinder, and the Tower burger. The sweet potato hash was absolutely amazing. I have had it twice now and it does not disappoint. It has a spicy undertone and perfectly cooked potatoes, chorizo, and a tortilla that is out of this world. The only recommendation I have is that I usually substitute the sweet potatoes for regular potatoes. It just tastes better this way.  

The Italian grinder came pressed and full of meats. I like the fact that it's pressed so that your ingredients do not fall out. And it looks more like a panini. The meats and cheese has a perfect balance. It came with a side of potato salad. Overall no complaints there. 

The Tower burger. Wow was this a burger. I have eaten many burgers at many different locations and I would be hard pressed not to put this one in my top five.  I got it medium. With Spicy jack cheese and An egg on top.  It was very juicy. When you bite in and the yolk of the egg oozes inside the burger it just adds so much flavoring. Comes with a side of house chips. 

Liberty market is def one of the best places in down town Gilbert and I am on a mission to try every item on that menu.  They certainly for the time being get my 5 stars."}
{"text":"You can't make a wrong decision here when looking at their menu. I love the variety of choices and how it can satisfy any mood I'm in. My absolute go to every trip is an oatmeal cream pie!! They are simply the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I had the Salmon BLT today. Serious yum.  
My only wish is that they had a separate line to for pastries.  My son wanted the GINORMOUS cinnamon roll but the line was too long to wait in a second time.  Also, the espresso machine is a beautiful work of art."}
{"text":"This place has probably the best breakfast in the area. REALLY. And if it wasn't just the food that would blow you away in itself, they even serve alcohol!! Mimosas anyone?? lol"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times left something to be desired. The first visit, I had the BLT but the bacon was way too sweet and it was almost inedible. My husband had the featured burger, \"5 Alarm Burger\" and it was decent. On our second visit we had the special of the day which was a meat dish and the meat tasted really gamey and old. We really wanted to like this place, especially since they have gluten free options."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my bday and we brought along my dog and the dog she was dog sitting. They were very accommodating...especially for the 2 dogs. I had a great time. The atmosphere was neat and the food was amazing. We both got the flatiron steak and the chimichurri sauce was spot on. We also had the pleasure to converse with the manager as well as the owner. You could tell they both had a passion for running a successful restaurant and it clearly shows. I highly recommend this restaurant as it has a little bit of everything for anyone."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning, the burrito was outstanding! The coffee, perfect, and the staff  treat the guest as if you are in their own home."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. 

The high school girl at the counter (8/16/14) didn't know how to take an order and move people, and the seating host stood around chit-chatting as the line was to the door.

To make matters worse, they then ask for a tip after making you wait in line just to order.

If they're going to do a cafeteria style restaurant they should have cafeteria style prices and not expect a tip from someone who just waited in like for 20-30 minutes. 

Fortunately the food and coffee were good, but I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Winner of best concept for an expensive cafeteria.

As Gilbert residents and regulars to the \"old town\" area, we've been to Liberty Market numerous times, alone and with friends. In general we have found the food to be good, though at times inconsistent and unexceptional, but acceptable when in the area (not a destination eatery we'd drive to otherwise). Unfortunately, the service is uninspired or totally lacking. It galls me when a place charges the same (or higher) prices than other establishments that offer full table service and comparable (or superior) food.

A recent visit there will be our last. The evening we went there were 4 of us who were meeting to discuss planning of an upcoming old town event and we wanted a quiet place to converse over wine and food. This time the service was not only uninspired but downright rude.

When 3 of our party attempted to sit at larger table with chairs for six (allowing us to more easily view our materials), one of the staff said \"you can't sit there because it's ONLY for parties of six.\" He subsequently pointed to a small 4-top and said \"sit over there\". In many restaurants the 4-top he pointed out would have been a 2-top, so our casual planning session was cramped and uncomfortable.

To emphasize my point even further, the place was less than 1/3 full and it was near closing... in fact the 4th of our party, a business owner from across the street, arrived only a about 15 minutes before the manager locked the door. 

Instead of building customer good will and making us feel welcome, this staffer decided to convenience himself and inconvenience us.

Joe's BBQ across the street definitely projects a feeling of appreciation for their patrons, but the management team at this restaurant where Joe is a partner, is worlds apart when it comes to \"community\".

We really wanted to like this place and have been going there since they first opened in 2009, but after this last encounter we will NEVER return as there are dozens of establishments in the area that make you feel welcome and appreciated, as well as offering comparable or superior food with the added benefit of full table service."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say except this place rocks my world! I am in love with the picnic salad! I dream about the picnic salad. When I drive by downtown Gilbert, I have food affairs because of the picnic salad. Oh great, now I want another picnic salad!"}
{"text":"Scones and pizza were superb!!! I got my friend addicted! She drives from ahwatukee to liberty market daily for the scones!! Lol"}
{"text":"6/22/2018 - Great food and customer service. Coffee bar is pretty cool, tonight we stopped in to get dessert and coffee !!!"}
{"text":"Didn't quite live up to the hype for us- given that we were in town for a limited time and made our dinner plans based on their menu online, we were surprised to find that they were more casual than we expected. Their evening seating policy is interesting (see photos for more info), but overall the food was not quite as good as we had hoped.

CRAB CAKE APP: Fine. Went unfinished at the table. Served in a large portion of sauce with wild rice, could make a small meal.
TOWER BURGER: Great-tasting meat, appreciate the GF bun, otherwise not really remarkable.
CHILAQUILES: Messy but fairly good, eggs were a bit undercooked with unset whites. Don't add on the green chile pork, the portions of the dish without tasted better. 

Service was polite, food was out fairly fast. From reading a local publication later, it seems maybe their sandwiches or breakfast dishes are their forte. Props for having so many choices on the menu, but the ones we tried weren't that great."}
{"text":"Joe - wherever/whoever you are... you sir, are a genius. 

LOVE LOVE LOVE the Joe's line of restaurants. 
Went here because I love Joe's Real Farm Grill and wanted to see if his 3rd restaurant in Gilbert would hold up.
Yup! It did! 
The bathrooms are just as fun (and borderline creepy) as all the other :)
Food = AMAZING! 
The chicken pasta is to die for. Twice. 
The sloppy joes are even good - and I don't like retaurant sloppy joes :)
All in all - go here. It's delicious."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is AMAZING, has thee best breakfast I have ever had. Nice big portions and great food. Yummy!!!  I have been here twice now oh and did I say amazing!!! I think they should have a 6 star. Delicious."}
{"text":"When a party of 9 walks in during lunch and 2/3 of that party is made up of children under 8, you'd think most waitstaff would give an eye roll and exasperated sigh. Not at Liberty Market. As soon as we were half way in the door we were greeted, asked if we were there for lunch, and the guy asked one of the ladies to push a couple tables together for us. 

We struggled with a couple of the little ones, who wants to sit where, grabbed some menus, and got down to business. I noticed a sign that mentioned to order your food first before taking a seat. Now I'm even more impressed since they got us a table which allowed us to really figure out what we were doing.

My girlfriends and I split the salmon BLT and some other sandwich, I don't remember which one. We also got the kale salad and the sweet potato salad. My daughter got the cheese pizza. The food was good. Wish we had room for rice pudding.

As we were finishing up, one of the cooks came out and complimented us on our kids being so well-behaved. Something every mom likes to hear. :)

The service alone us enough to make me come back. The food could have sucked (it didn't), and I would still be raving."}
{"text":"The brunch here was like nothing I've ever had. My friends and I went on a Sunday morning and everyone got something different and every single thing I tried was WONDERFUL. At one point, I decided that this is what they must eat in Heaven because it was THAT good.

I had your standard eggs, bacon, potatoes and biscuits&gravy. It was devine. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Always good food... and the staff is really nice. Their minestrone soup is incredible - add some chicken... as is their cobb salad... and their homemade ice cream sandwiches.

If you belly up to the coffee bar.. ask for Theresa - she's fun, knowledgeable, and pulls a mean coffee... ! =)"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is so delicious!! Everything I've had is awesome, if you like egg salad theirs rocks!! Oh and don't forget a piece of their zucchini bread yum!"}
{"text":"Their food is always fresh.  I really like their picnic sandwich.  I've also had the thin crust pepperoni pizza and it was ok. It seemed really greasy.  Their chicken salad sandwich was also very good.  I loved the cranberries and nuts in it, makes it very tasty.  There is always a huge line to order if you go in the middle of dinner time.  I would recommend going early to beat the rush.  Lunch isn't as busy."}
{"text":"This is the first and unfortunately last time I will be visiting the Liberty Market. My idea of a good breakfast is good service and an enjoyable, relaxing time, all three of which I did not experience during my visit. 

The place is utter chaos. When you walk in you think that there are available tables, but then someone comes over to you and lets you know that she is \"seating the table right now\", and you can order and she will find you a place to sit. That's fine, but a sign near the door stating, \"please wait to be seated\" would solve about 99% of the \"hostess\" running around and rearranging people, and 100% of the confusion for first time visitors. They would almost serve themselves better by letting people seat themselves....It was stressful enough to watch the poor girl run around trying to seat people. 

On that note, I saw her let people sit down until she had to seat a party, then she made them get up and stand, which I thought was incredibly rude. She also seated my party of two, and after we sat down, SHE MOVED US! To a smaller table. Fine, we are only a party of two, but once you make up your mind on where you are going to seat a party, keep it, its rude to make them move after they have been seated. 

We ordered our food, I got the Chorizo Quesadilla...good, but nothing great that I couldn't get at other establishments. We even commented to each other how the food should be outstanding...it must be for us to want come back, but again, it was nothing to rave about. 

The food took a long time, and the place is LOUD. The busers are around in flurries setting up and taking down tables, but it's beyond impossible to flag one down to get a box for your food at the end of the meal. 

We left more stressed out then full in our bellies. Granted we visited on a busy Sunday morning, but customer service should always be a companies top priority, here it wasn't. I felt like we got nothing but a stressful expensive meal instead. I rated Liberty Market \"fairly\" at one star, because like the rating says, I think not. I would not visit again, nor would I recommend to my family or friends."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST IS AWESOME, Best Biscuits and gravy ever... and This place serves Cortado's and Cortaditos which is CUBAN coffee...Great food for lunch as well but I havnt been for dinner yet  because you walk up and order then sit ..its a not quite what you would expect for dinner..I'm sure the food is awesome but they need to change that part at night to make it a little more traditional at night to go with the ambiance of the surrounding's of old town gilbert. I really like it during the day."}
{"text":"It's good but the lines are kinda annoying, which makes me wonder if it's worth my time."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, I wish they had this in California. I would come here for breakfast lunch and dinner if I could. I thought the salmon plate was very good since there was plenty of salmon with a little bit of mixed greens and bread. It was funny because when I got here a local tv station was interviewing the chef here so it was cool to see that happen live. I would come back since this place reminded me of a casual place to have any meal. I would love to try this place for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill, and was excited to try Liberty Market. We had passed by numerous times, and had peeked in once or twice. 

The decor is awesome. And the food is good. I'm a pizza snob, and theirs did not disappoint.

I think I need to try this again, though, in order to justify another star. It was good, quality, but not sure I was really impressed."}
{"text":"great space, urban/hip atmosphere. will definitely be back for the pasta bowl, but the molinari pizza was a huge mistake. lot's of parents vying for scarce high chairs. friendly staff. first time in old town gilbert...cute.

UPDATE
went back for another go around. caprese pizza this time...so good with just the right amount of fresh basil. and couldn't pass up what has the be the best pasta bowl in the e. valley."}
{"text":"A few days ago I was in the vicinity of Liberty Market and decided it to give it a shot. I ordered the Tower Burger with St. Pete's Blue Cheese and Bacon. The burger was juicy and tasty. The added blue cheese and bacon made it even more scrumptious. The burger was accompanied by fresh Kettle Chips and three distinctly different dipping sauces. 

What sets Liberty Market apart from other places with a great burger is the great service. All the employees were friendly and engaging. Definitely looking forward to enjoying more tasty meals there.

Oh and I don't forget to try the Ice Cream Sandwich. It consists of phenomenal vanilla ice cream sandwiched between Liberty's Chocolate Chip cookies then rolled in almonds, toffee and chocolate chips. It is out of this world."}
{"text":"I've been to the Liberty Market 4 or 5 times. Yesterday I had the Picnic sandwich... delicious! Some folks might like the sweet potato salad. I thought it was just  \"OK\". probably would get a different side next time like the corn/tomato/bean salad that Susan got. Liberty is one of the establishments that makes downtown Gilbert \"cool\".  Service is good and atmosphere is nice. This is not a dinner place for that special occasion, more like a high class cafeteria. Thanks Joe Johnson, for your vision for downtown Gilbert!
Why not 5 stars? I can get a terrific glass of wine across the street at Postino's for five bucks or go next door to Oregano's and Susan and I share a $9 salad and are \"stuffed.\"  Prices at Liberty are a little steep compared to the neighbors. It does offer variety to downtown Gilbert's foodie menu and we will definitely return, especially to use the bathrooms that are another subject for another day:)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go in Gilbert! Absolutely LOVE it! Breakfast is delicious but my ultimate favorite would have to be their white pizza. I always ask to have avocado added to it with a ginger ale and a side of mac&cheese, perfection!
Their coffee bar is also unbelievably tasty! Iced vanilla latte, and a scone is my regular."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with friends. Food was good, but pricey. It was very crowded, which is usually a good sign for a restaurant, right? I would recommend the outdoor seating which has a very nice ambiance in spite of the crowd."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time on a Sunday.  After all the hype on this place I was a little put off by the actuality.  Upon walking in for lunch we were told to wait in line for 30min  where someone would assign us a table and eventually take our order.  It was a beautiful day out, we couldn't walk around the streets waiting for a table, no.  My pregnant wife and I had to stand for 30min on concrete floors waiting to place our order for mostly pre-made food.

My wife order the \"Best Chicken Sandwich\" with an Asian Cucumber Salad (the special side of the day) and I got the \"Picnic\" with roasted sweet potato salad.  My wife ordered a latte and I had a bottled beer (nothing on tap) and an iced tea.  Since both sandwiches were labeled as gluten free (as were many of the sandwiches - why have that be the main bread option) and knowing that gluten-free bread isn't really bread we asked about other options.

I was told they had other options but was only given the gluten-free bread, bun or wheat bread.  I chose the bun, my wife's sandwich came with the bun (which I suppose means that the bun is GF also).  

Although the line was huge the tables were about half empty.  We were still wedged in a main walk area right next to another couple with many tables open that were more out of the way.

The iced tea was empty when I went to fill my glass, when it was finally filled it was very weak (which is ok with me).  My wife's coffee (she is a Starbucks regular) was bitter, overly strong, and didn't have enough milk.

Her chicken sandwich had a nice grill flavor but the bun was untoasted and dry.  The Asian cucumber salad was bland.  My cold, roasted sweet potato salad tasted like cold, day old, browned sweet potato.  There were dried cranberries (I think) in the salad but they didn't add much IMO.  The sandwich was overstuffed in the center and fell to pieces immediately.  It wasn't served on the bun I requested, only the regular bread which had a stale texture and was untoasted.  The sandwich was impossible to eat without a knife and a fork (or going caveman).  The turkey was good, but IMO there was too much blue cheese and not enough green apple.  the sandwich was also poorly constructed with a giant wad of \"stuff\" in the middle that tapered to the edges pushing all everything out when gripped. The toasted pecans immediately fell out.  Is it really that hard to construct a sandwich?

The place reminds me a lot of Joe's Farm Grill.  A lot of ingredients that impress people when listed (arugula, brie, aioli, ect)  and promises of freshness that aren't delivered on, but still impress the customers.  If you decide to try this place during peak hours wear comfortable shoes."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill for a while, so was excited to hear Joe had purchased the old Liberty Market in downtown Gilbert and was reopening it with his touch of flair.

Joe did not disappoint. He kept the core building intact, with cracked concrete floor and flaky neon sign, but gave the seating a clean metal polish. The E61 coffee bar serves a mean espresso and a good cappuccino in a more Italian coffee bar approach (i.e. NOT Starbucks)

Breakfast has paninis and other hot items plus rolls and muffins for sale. Lunch and dinner has a wide range of items from wood fired pizzas to vegetable salads and the very tasty \"Liberty Bowl\".

Food is also available To Go, and there is a small but good selection of food paraphernalia. Outside seating on a small patio is perfect at this time of year.

Be sure to check out the open bathroom (common sinks) with 5 individually decorated Male/Female bathroom stalls. A shame they can't put a camera in there to capture the reaction as people go back there for the first time.

Another nice addition to downtown Gilbert, and very much worth a visit."}
{"text":"Environment is nothing special and restaurant is pricey for the accommodations. Service is slightly above average. The pasta dish was fantastic  and minestrone soup was excellent. The pizza was the worst I've had in decades (from someplace other than a chain fast-pizza place), with little sauce, sparce toppings, and bland flavor...and most went uneaten.
Might venture in again sometime off peak hours for the pasta, but not worth standing in line for.."}
{"text":"For some reason at this place I just haven't been good about trying new things. It's not that I don't want to try the entire menu ... I do ... it's just what I have already tried in the past has been so good, I can't *not* order it again (and my stomach only has so much room)!
 
The first time I checked this place out about a year and a half ago, I ordered the oven-roasted fingerling fries and the chopped salad, and that's what I've ordered every time since. The fingerling fries are to-die-for and come dressed in some kind of romano cheese/garlic/parsley mix, and with ketchup and an insanely yummy aioli for dipping. The chopped salad is an interesting yet addictive mix of kale, dried apricots, jicama, corn, and grilled chicken, in a spicy vinaigrette and topped with pieces pumpkin seed brittle. (Candy on a salad? Trust me, it works.)

Most recently I visited on a Saturday night around 6pm. The line was long but moved quickly, and even though this is an order-at-the-counter place they have a system in place at busy times to ensure your party is seated at a table once you've placed your order. My mom came with me and ordered the Far East salad and the crab cake; I of course tried a bit of both and they were excellent. I may have to branch out and get that salad for myself next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! First, big props to Mr. Johnston for renovating an old (for Gilbert) buidling instead of doing a tear-down which is more common in the Valley. My architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure. I remember Liberty Market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo. It's wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Breakfast is yummy. I always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian. It's loaded with goat cheese so what's not to love? Biscuits, cinnamon buns, and sticky buns are fantastic.

For lunch and dinner, I stick with the caprese salad or sandwich. Their thin crust pizza is very good, but the caprese is exceptional so it's hard to venture from it. I've had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread (pane bianco), the actual fillings are so much better at Liberty Market. The other item I have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad. It's unreal! No mayo here, instead it's tossed with chipotle (i think) flavored oil, craisins, and pecans. On a side note, I would love it if Liberty would over some veggie meat option a la Capriotti's so that I could try their other sandwiches.

Desserts all kick ass. I've had the red velvet and carrot cakes here, both some of the best I've had. If you're only going to get one dessert, make it the bread pudding. A friend of mine who lived in France for two years said it was the best in the world. It totally is! It's a great value two considering you can share it among 3+ adults.

If you come here for nothing else, you must have some coffee. As a coffee drinker, it would be an abomination for me to visit Liberty and not get something from the E61 bar. The last time I went I got an iced latte, and I was actually mad because it was *so* good. Mad, as in \"Why isn't all espresso this good?\" and \"Why don't I drink this every day?\""}
{"text":"Ahhhhh yes this place hit the spot for Saturday brunch with the family! I have always driven past this cute restaurant in downtown Gilbert and on Saturday we decided to finally hit it up! 

We walked in around 1 and it was super busy! You grab your menu and head on back to the end of the line. (That day it was back by the restrooms) We waited about 20 mins to finally make it to the front of the line to order. The employee taking our order was so friendly and he just seemed so happy to be there which made me happy:) As your standing in line, the hostess will come up to you and ask you how many are in your party and she will reserve you a table.  We ordered our food, got our drinks, sat down, and our food arrived about 10 minutes later.

What we ordered: 

Chilaquiles: so spicy and so flavorful! Huge portion/ shareable 

Kids cheeseburger with fries: big size 

Best Chicken sandwich: juicy and big piece of chicken 

Two Tower Burgers: flavorful, juicy, huge, and so tasty! The meat was cooked to perfection and had that great charred flavor!

Tomato Soup: a little bland in flavor, we put pepper, salt, and Tabasco in it for the flavor it lacked 

 Rustic Mac and Cheese: amazing! I loved this juicy creation!! 

Blueberry dessert and chocolate cookie: YUMMY! 

*I do wish the location was a little bigger since it was so PACKED while we were there. You do bump into people and you have to watch where you walk you or you will run into something or someone. Tables are close to each other so be careful when pulling out you chairs.

* It is a little on the pricey side but the food is definitely worth it! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Liberty is soooo good. The only thing I don't understand is you have to order and pay at the counter but then there is a server if you need another drink or something. Maybe they should have a full service section for people like myself who like to order tons of stuff without having to keep getting up?"}
{"text":"The food here is ok. I've been here twice. The second time I came here my service was terrible. The wrong order was brought out and they also ran out of one of their side dishes like their fruit I recall? So instead of telling us that they ran out our cashier substituted it without telling us. That's two strikes right there. I will not be returning. Bad service plus a long wait does not make for returning customers."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Liberty Market. The food, the staff, just about everything is fantastic. The wait can be long, but once you order, the food comes very quick. It would be great at peak times if they used both registers, not sure why they don't, but oh well. There's one employee who I think is some kind of manager who grates on my nerves a little (she's too perky about \"how is everything\" and comes off as insincere, which I'm sure isn't her intention) and has given me some snark at the register, but we don't let that ruin anything. Only other MINOR issue is if you order both cold and hot things (ex: a salad + an entree), the salad items seem to get lost in the serving stage. Liberty is definitely on our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"I throughly enjoyed my first visit here. Let me say, the first downside? Just the fact that it is located in \"downtown\" gilbert....and the only \"downtown\" part is the crap shoot parking situations and the fact that we went around 4, and turning left at the tiny intersection was a nightmare with the 'traffic'. Howeeverrr, after we played parking roulette to find a spot,  i was plesently surprised by the place. it was not at all crowded inside.

A little pricey. Food was delicious. Although, the barrista did forget about my friends' coffee drinks, but we really werent in a hurry. I like the set up, order at the counter and then go grab a table. They have a nice little patio set-up as well. I hope to come back soon (= maybe not during that time though ha ha."}
{"text":"I've lived in Gilbert since before it was \"the place\" been going to Liberty since my oldest daughter dragged me there. Loved it. Still has great food but I've seen the price changes. I use to get two paper containers for the soup to go for a large now it's 1 and it isn't full regularly. There's more but it would sound more like ranting suffice to say the price and quantity are in disequilibrium at this point. Maybe if you didn't know them at the beginning it wouldn't bother you. But, too many competing eateries downtown now to have to pay for less."}
{"text":"Warning: I can't say much about this place, because I've only been once, and earlier that day I had stared into a full-length mirror, thinking, \"Jesu cristo, I seriously need to stop eating so badly.\"

So, my one opinion on the one food item I've eaten, the beet salad: godDAMN that was good. Pretty sure that was the first time in my life that I finished an entire plate of salad. Please tell me the secret?! Whatever the dressing was (maybe just olive oil and I'm a plebe??), it was perfect, and the nuts and goat cheese and and and..."}
{"text":"I went Sunday morning to get my carb fix and this wonderful sweet roll didn't let me down. Coffee here is wonderful it has a very robust flavor and with the self-serv drink station you get plenty to wash the sweet roll down. Egg breakfast with smashed meatball was absolutely amazing. The homemade biscuit with butter and homemade jelly put me over-the-top. Time to go to the gym!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and located in a neat area of downtown Gilbert that is fun to explore.  We have ridden our bikes here many a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great coffee and breakfast. Chilaquiles are fantastic. Service is top notch."}
{"text":"We are regulars for breakfast at Liberty Market.  We order the demi breakfast times 3 for our family.  I CRAVE the biscuits and gravy and the Liberty potatoes.  The scrambled eggs are nothing special, but combined with the other stuff--it works.  I am dismayed that they stopped putting the little pieces of fruit on the plate.  It was a perfect way to end the breakfast meal.  I don't love the ordering process (like many folks already wrote) but I also can't see another way to do it that will move so many customers through the process.  I do think Kirsten (spelling?), the manager/part-owner, needs to smile more and not be so abrupt with customers.  I think she comes off rushed, and annoyed. That's just my opinion though.  
I just read this and I realize how negative I sound for reviewing it at 4 stars.  I would revise my review but it is what it is.  You are paying for good food and a good local experience.  And we will continue to be regulars. :)"}
{"text":"I just tried Liberty Market for breakfast. I had the Sicilian scramble with a biscuit, potatoes, and a latte. Everything was outstanding. The latte was flavorful with a good roast, not the charcoal used in espresso drinks at some famous coffee shops. The scramble was savory, delicious, and had some great sausage in it. The surprise star, though, was the humble biscuit. I'm very harsh on biscuits. They're always too dry, too tough, not crusty enough, or otherwise compromised in some way. This one was absolutely perfect and probably the best I've ever had.

I recently moved to Gilbert, and Liberty Market is fast becoming my favorite place to eat out."}
{"text":"This place is rather popular among the locals! Every time I have been there, there is always a ridiculously long line. Good thing they work fast or else I would have just skipped next door. Food is okay (not really that impressed). What I found I did love was there coffee and how they have their own barrista manning the counter by himself!  Their expresso was rich, strong and smooth just the way I like it. Hence, the additional star. I would come back just for the coffee alone. Like previous reviews, their pastrie did look rather dry and bulk made so I didn't want to venture to try it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for well over a year now and haven't written a review even though they definitely deserve one....

I've only been here for breakfast but this is always our go to spot with all the choices that Downtown Gilbert has to offer. The staff is always friendly, the food is always amazing, and even though they are consistently busy they take care of the customer.  

Best things on the menu: sticky bun, flattened meatballs, and their oversized breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I felt a little awkward on our first visit. Apparently if you want designer coffee stuff you go to one counter, if you want lunch you go to another. We went to the wrong person! Sorry...

So after being corrected we headed to the lunch ordering area where they were really cool about telling us the drill.

Great sandwiches! Good sides too. 5 stars for the food, atmosphere & service (after we were told we went to the wrong counter). Minus a star for the pretentious goofball at the coffee counter."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places to have lunch. Save your money and eat at home. My picnic sandwich was dry and flavorless. The turkey they claimed was roasted was sliced lunch meat from Walmart with tons of salt added to it. I had the caprese pasta salad as a side. It tasted like a bowl of boiled noodles. Absolutely no flavor at all! I can't figure out why this place has over 1,000 reviews.... what a joke!! My advise would be to walk across the street to Postinos for some flavor."}
{"text":"Quick review: modern, great pancakes, expensive ($37.45 for 3), self-serve set up like culvers, I would not return.

Since living here in Gilbert since 2008 I have heard good things about this place, but never have gone here. I picked up some people from the airport and we went straight here for breakfast. 

We arrive on a monday morning around 10 AM. It was not crowded, but not empty either. We entered thinking it was a restaurant that you get waited on. We were wrong, it is exactly like Culver's. You grab a large one-sided paper menu and stand in line to order. It was a disappointment to see only one cashier taking orders. Took about 8-10 minutes just to start placing our order. 

After we all got a basic breakfast meal and 3 standard self serve coffee's the total was $37.46!!! Yikes! 

Then, the coffee runs out! I eventually get that fixed, then get my coffee and the creamer is out!! Wow! 

The only reason to go back is for the pancakes. They are the best I have had in a long time. The sausage is bland and egg portion is small. Coffee was okay.

The bathrooms are unisex which was awkward. There are individual locking stalls with locks that state vacant or occupied like a port-a-potty! Then everyone uses the same sinks.

Overall, even though the pancakes were excellent, the overall process is not inviting and service is poor. Therefore, I will not be back and recommend others try somewhere else unless you like serving yourself and got money to blow! I would've given it 1 star if it wasn't for the pancakes."}
{"text":"A very comfortable setting with high ceilings and plenty of windows for people watching. We've been here before for breakfast which was very good. This time I opted for the hummus platter and flat iron steak with a side of butternut squash soup and a green pomegranate green tea. The hummus platter comes with spicy seasoned olives and mini toasted bread. Perfect for a one person meal. The flat iron steak comes with mashed potatoes and seasoned asparagus. The butternut squash soup comes in a large bowl also large enough for a meal. Altogether the meal was delicious and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Their black bean burger is the best! The venue is a little small for all of the business they get but the food is worth it. Parking is good just down the way across from the water tower."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! I had the best sandwich I have ever had, the wood fired turkey sandwich. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is great and it is in a great location. we love all of Joe's places. cool place to hang out in as well."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is one of my favorite places in all of Gilbert.  Joe and his wife are excellent restaurant owners and very hospitable and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I went to this place and had a caprese salad it was gooooddd. I liked that they do not fill your salad up with lettuce and then add few other ingredients. for the price of $10 it was filled with mozarella cheese and tomatoes which is awesome. The dressing was great as well. Their deserts looked so yummy. This is definitely a place I would consider again!"}
{"text":"Grabbed the Margarita Pizza and Farmer's Salad to go.. pizza was a bit plain, but the tomato sauce kicked it up in flavor. Farmer's salad was just okay, didn't have very many veggies in it, just mainly leafy greens. Hmmm."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I've ever had at LM has been high quality, delicious, and fun to try. They also make a wonderfully smooth latte!!"}
{"text":"Despite a 3 star review I do like this place. It has a good relaxed atmosphere, it's order-up so you have access to the fountain drinks, and it's a great location. I love the quartinito coffee, good selection of beer and wine, and the staff is very friendly. I just have to say the food options are just so so. The salads are very disappointing, lots of iceberg lettuce and lacking in toppings. I have never found a side item that I loved. They got rid of Thai ribs that I loved. Also the line is sometimes very long and moves slow. The pizza is probably the best thing on the menu, you usually can't go wrong with the special."}
{"text":"I brought my kiddos here for the first time on a Friday night. I usually drop in for a sandwich during off hours so peak time was a different experience for me. I was still impressed with how the staff handled the rush and the wait time for food was better than anticipated. My son got the pressed meatball sandwich which was very good. My daughter and I decided to share our food. We both wanted to try the salmon blt and we were both glad we did. It was absolutely delicious and I will be back just to have that again! I have had a craving for a Cobb salad for a while so I got the Hollywood Cobb. My daughter doesn't like Bleu Cheese so we subbed Ranch dressing. It was all very fresh but lacked some flavor thus the reason for only 4 stars. The staff is great, the restaurant is always very clean, I love the atmosphere and the location is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the lines at this spot at all and especially since it's not \"all dat\"! The food quality is above average but the prices are so high I became dizzy at the cash register where one pays. Enough said..."}
{"text":"I love coming to Liberty Market! I may be a little biased because my family used to own this place when it was a market back in the day, but I still love coming to eat here. Little known face: My uncles name is in the ground by the entrance. 

The food here is delicious! Whether you come for coffee, breakfast, lunch or dinner, I love all of the food that I try and order. I always order something different every time that I come here to try new foods, but I would definitely recommend the caprese salad, caprese pasta and the breakfast burrito. 

They have \"gender neutral\" bathrooms kind of because it's just individual bathrooms. You order at the register and they give you a number and bring out your food. They have lot of desserts and alcoholic beverages too. You can sit inside or outside. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"This is rather hard to do, but in good conscience I have to knock off a few stars from Liberty Market. 
The past two visits, I've had less-than-delish food and have been pretty disappointed in my old favorite.
The Italian Salad that I have loved since first bite, doesn't taste the same and doesn't taste as fresh (the greens, that is).
In addition, the soup that was pretty darned delish (minestrone) was watery, less-than-hot in temperature, and very tasteless.
The lovely lady that used to make salads has disappeared from the scene, and I am wondering if that is the reason that my Italian Salad doesn't take oh-so-fresh.
Perhaps this little lunchery is just getting too popular, and there are steps to reduce wait that are impeding the wonderful flavors of months gone by...
Whatever the reason, I'm sadly disappointed as of late in Liberty Market..."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Liberty Market. I've only been here a couple of times but it's been awesome each time. The service is great and so is the food. I recommend the Italia sandwich.  This place is always busy and is a testiment to their product.  Go. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Honestly, Liberty Market has to be one of the best things that has ever happened to Downtown Gilbert.  Their espresso drinks are wonderful (the cortado is to die for), their scones are amazing, their pizzas are delish, and honestly they have the best minestrone I have ever had in my entire life. 
The wine and beer selection is okay.  I wouldn't go here if I was out for drinks in particular.  The only exception is the Irish Coffee, which is mighty fine."}
{"text":"This was my first time on this restaurant, my wife and I were looking for a place to eat and came across this one.
The pizza was good, but the burger was amazing and we finish with the monsoon pie which was really good, but I wished they put more chocolate in it.
The people over there are nice and really helpful, we really enjoyed it and we are definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Well, I've been to Liberty Market several times now and it's time to add my two cents. Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Don't worry, I'll stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version.

Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.  

A few of my favorites
1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection!
2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going?
3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad
4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if you're into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four.
there are more, but I promised to keep it short.

Back to the line. As you're making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number.

Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if you're planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you'll let them.

And now you know what to expect.  If you don't like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Let's just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . I'm out!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A true treasure in downtown Gilbert. The food and the service was great. When you go in you place an order and you can choose any table to sit in. Had a nice family dinner with no fuss. The staff was friendly and they checked on our table twice, the owner even came to speak with us."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars if not for the wait. ..waiting ...waiting. ...so i hate waiting. I really really like the food and the pastry is amazing.  But alas i wont be here again due to the wait.  The sweet potato muffin was seriously to die for...but the wait geeze."}
{"text":"I truly love all of Joe's places.  Liberty Market has the best espresso I have ever had.  I always order a cortadito and it never fails to bring joy to my day.  The food is always great the atmosphere is amazing.  The service is always top notch.  If you want to relax and get a feel for Gilbert this is the place for you.  If it's your birthday you also get $10 worth of free food.  Thanks for making us feel special on our birthday Joe!"}
{"text":"Took my clients to Liberty Market this past Monday for lunch. We had the best chicken sandwich and caprese panini. Both were delicious. 

But let me rave about the desserts.  The carrot cake was delish. Not sickenly sweet but delectable.  Moist layers with just the right amount of spice. Loved the cream cheese frosting and 4 layers. We also had the zebra brownies, which was a chocolate cream cheese layered brownie and the salt river bar. The salt river bar was not what I expected (in a good way). It had a saltine bottom and delicious butterscotch and chocolate layers. Not very sweet, I wish I had ordered coffee to go with it but was full from the bottomless soft drinks (BTW, thanks for having Coke Zero, my fave drink).  

The chef came out and the servers came to check on us frequently. One of the nicest surprises was when the owner's daughter came by and checked on us. I said that I wish I had enough room to have a slice of red velvety cake but was stuffed.  I had noticed everyone around us had red velvet cake. She said it was a crowd favorite.  The very next moment she brought us a huge piece of the 4 layers of goodness!  She packaged it up and still brought us forks \"just in case\" we wanted to lingerand  try it. It was again the perfect balance. I don't like the really sweet type of red velvet cakes you get here in Texas. You could still taste the chocolate undertones eventhough the cake was a brilliant red.

Just read the Cult of the Customer, and I will say, besides the wonderful food and outstanding service, Liberty Market created a \"moment of magic\" just by sending over the cake.  It showed me that the waitress listened to my wishes. Next time I am in town, I am going to Liberty market again!"}
{"text":"This is the sort of review that the Liberty Market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with.  They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.

So we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.

Well all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.

We got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...

the worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with \"talk to the (paw print)\" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.

WOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.
WOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.
WOMAN: (orders fifty more things)
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)
WOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.

So I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.

A couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?

Fat person code: (I am an authority)
1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.
2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.
3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.

Anyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...

Our red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. 

There were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify \"fresh\") red velvet cake.

Having said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.

__________________

**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promise"}
{"text":"We eat here for breakfast a few times a month. The food is always delicious! We like eating outside when the weather cools down. Staff is helpful and nice. Did I mention the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this spot in downtown Gilbert!! They have the best tasting food and so many choices to choose from. They have a beautiful restaurant and small outside patio! I come here with my family all the time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We usually go for breakfast, but wow, dinner is outstanding! (And today we went to Liberty Market for both... LOL) It can be pricey & you will spend a pretty penny on any of the specials they have, but we do it every time because it is so worth it!!! When Chef Dave puts a special on the menu, you can be certain that it will be full of flavor & amazing! I have to say, he has perfected the soup du jour-it has been delicious no matter which one we try. Highly recommend dining here =)"}
{"text":"The Liberty Market is a fun place to go. There is no table service but the food is good, selection is fantastic and the staff is eager to please. They have a couple decent vegetarian options and the ambiance is fresh and clean. I dig it and will be back..."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service.  I only gave it four stars because of the typical Johnston dining experience, which includes cluttered drink stations, confusing lines, and a cluster of a mess trying to grab food and watch your table at the same time.

Can these places just get a wait staff with servers, please??"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Marg. pizza is delicious and I dream of their cheese burger, it is a MUST. We used to live right down the way from Liberty Market but have recently moved to Tucson. We go every time we're in town."}
{"text":"First off, anywhere you go in Gilbert, whether it be a Tuesday at 5 PM or a Saturday at 10AM is going to have an hour wait. Liberty Market is no different, and for good reason. The historic restaurant is killer. We walked in at 11AM on a Sunday and the line was out the back door. We decided to wait, and I'm glad we did. 

In line, a gentleman approached us and took my fiance's drink order. While we waited, we were able to read the whole history of the restaurant. Another amazing hostess came and picked a table for us while we waited in line so that we didn't have to worry about finding a table. Then I decided to hop out of line to order an espresso at the coffee bar. I told the barista my table number, but when my cappuccino was ready, he noticed we hadn't yet ordered. Instead, we met halfway so I could enjoy my cappuccino while we waited to order. Then we ordered, and when we got to our table, and this was my only annoyance, there was a party of three, I'll say it, total d-bags, sitting next to us. They had squished themselves into the table and decided to take our rollups and place settings and proceeded to talk about really inappropriate things during their entire meal. 

Once our food arrived, the server was fantastic, the food was great, and we ate quickly due to the conversation happening to my right, but would have loved to sit a little longer. Will definitely go back again. Oh, and if you haven't visited the bathrooms - go , and go in each one and shut/lock the door. Trust me. It's not weird once you do it."}
{"text":"My first visit here was great! I loved the restaurant style and ambiance, especially the decor. I went pretty early so there was no line, it is a walk up and order type of place but seating was a plenty and cozy. I had chilequilles, it was awesome and tasty. However, the waitstaff could've been a bit more pleasant and less snobby. That was my only complaint. By the time we were done eating there was a major line out the door, I have seen this place with quite the line prior and that's usually why I'll never really come during peak hours. Other than that, thumbs up all the way."}
{"text":"Ordered the margarita pizza with roasted veggies and jalapeños. It wasn't that bad but then again not the best. Liberty is not known for pizza however the crust was thin and buttery which made the experience worthwhile. The pizza was decent and refreshingly light which made my Sunday brunch all the more pleasant. 

Light, affordable, and simple. Good work Liberty."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs.  Takes a little getting used too.  Busy Saturday morning breakfast took 30 minutes to order food but only 5-10 to get food.  It was outstanding and well worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Neat and good food. Tried their Italian sandwich. Really good sandwich. The steak sandwich was below par for the price they charged. So.. 50 50 rating"}
{"text":"A refreshing way to order our food.  Service was quick, and staff was always checking in on us. Had the beet salad and supreme pizza.  All very good.  Would come back."}
{"text":"My advice. Go with the fresh brick oven pizza, the sausage was succulent, the ricotta sweet and the crust perfect. The Sicilian style pizza I can not say the same for, it is a generic cheese thick crust already baked up an when someone orders toppings they simply slap them on and reheat the pizza with the toppings. Leaving the crust overly crisped like biting into a crouton and the toppings only slightly warmed. Anything that is made to order is a winner! Anything Pre made and waiting such as sides, sicilian, cake can be skipped without missing much."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is the best. Service is great, and they are slammed on the weekends so get there early. Morning mimosas are pretty strong too. Its family friendly so kids will enjoy it as well. Its loud, and fun, so be ready for it!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market has been a favorite of mine for years now. I enjoy going no matter the time of day as they have excellent choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I've taken many friends and family here and we always return again and again. If you haven't tried it yet it's a must, but I suggest not going with large groups here and seating can be tricky."}
{"text":"I love the feeling in this establishment. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. We asked the manager some questions about some of the specialties on the menu. He was very hospitable. We ended up having coffee and dessert to end off our Saturday night on a sweet note!"}
{"text":"went there twice already with my wife and 3 boys..its a great place with great atmosphere, decor and classy bathrooms...one thing that impressed me is that while washing my hands instead of the mirror they have these glass windows and you can see outside the sitting area...nice and clean bathrooms...great quality food...whenever we wanna eat in Gilbert only couple places comes into mind for a family style place ...paradise bakery and liberty market our new favorite place now....i have tried their burger first time and it was heaven ..one of the best burgers i have ever had ...Gerome's Haunted hamburger have great burgers too...so this time i tried best chicken sandwich and man it was a chicken sandwich.i could taste that it was grilled bar b que style not flat grill but on the griddle one..which made it flavorful,,,and had fresh guacamole sauce on top cheese...and great homemade bread i think...fresh veggies i think from joe's farm land...my wife's capresse sandwich was great too...my kids got wood fired pizzas and they finished em....i have to try different stuff next time...ill be back soon...they have specials on facebook also all the time and i get to see them cuz i liked them :)"}
{"text":"I'm amazed at how friendly everyone here at Liberty Market is. Everytime I come here, the staff are all so happy and friendly. The Liberty Potatoes are the BEST potatoes I've ever tasted. The quesadilla is amazing also."}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to Liberty Market for quite some time, but every time I'd drive down Gilbert Rd with my friend, I'd point it out and say - UGH! We still need to go there!!  I happened to be off from work one day and we were both up early.  And hungry.  I suggested we go somewhere for breakfast.  Being from California, I remember cinnamon rolls were a big deal, and they seem all that impressive anywhere I've been in AZ.  I did some searches on Yelp and then I just switched it to breakfast, and Liberty Market popped up!  OH SNAP!  The place was busy enough with a long line, but nothing obnoxious and definitely worth the 9 minutes we were in line.  He ordered the breakfast sandwich, I the breakfast quesadilla with chicken, a pitcher of sangria, and a piece of carrot cake to go.  It wasn't cheap.  Tip and all it came out to sixty bucks, but the sangria itself was about 25 - be ready to drop some coin, but don't worry, the place will earn it fa sho!  There was one particular employee who I think was a manager that was better suited for a non customer contact position, like data processing - or worker at DMV.  We didn't let her spoil the morning.  I may have mentioned it on FourSquare and Twitter, but made it clear we were LOVING the experience.  They tweeted back before we even left saying thanks for coming in!  The portions were plenty.  Especially my quesadilla.  It was SO big and SO full I chose to take the other half home so I could tear into it while no one was watching at home. HA!  The carrot cake...  how my hunt went from cinnamon rolls to ending up with a carrot cake, I don't know, but aw lawd it was to die for!  If anything of the desserts or salads on display at Liberty Market are from Cisco, I'd be shocked.  Oh, except for the mixed fruit salad... that looked like it was straight out of a can of Dole.  I can't wait for our next visit.  We left satisfied, not STUFFED, and the whole experience, and sangria, put us in a great mood for the rest of the day.  I recommend this place for coworkers, friends, or even for a fun date before heading to a movie or Golf Land."}
{"text":"Liberty Market has been my favorite place to eat in Gilbert since I moved here a few months back. I don't give 5 star reviews lightly, so allow me to explain. In addition to having amazing food, breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert, this place has 5 star customer service. Tonight, my fiancée had the Hollywood Cobb Salad (a chopped salad with red and green leaf lettuce, chicken, tomato, bacon, avocado and blue cheese-delish), and I ordered the Chef's Pizza (Sicilian sausage, Brie, Apple, roasted garlic, honey and herb drizzle). We ordered it well-done cause I like my wood-fired pizza with a bit of crunch to the crust. It came out cooked, but not with the color or texture I would consider all the way done. The owner, Dave, not only came by and noticed and replaced my pizza, but he was gracious and let us know that the situation would not only be remedied for us, but the whole place-the folks cooking were reminded not to be afraid to give their pies a little \"character\" in that 1000 degree wood fired oven. We will be going back, many times over I'm sure!"}
{"text":"3rd visit to Libery. Here's a tip for patrons, sit at the bar, if u see open seats. Much faster service and Brian is great at multitasking. Wife had the fish special and I had the green chili cheese burger. Both meals were quite tasty, no complaints at all. Another gentleman would from time to time come back to give Brian a hand when drink orders were flying in. Both guys had a great attitude and seemed to enjoy being there. Place has always been packed when we have come. That means something must be going right. Will visit again at next opportunity."}
{"text":"The team from Joe's BBQ is at it again! Where do I even start with Liberty Market? Growing up, Liberty Market was an actual store but I much prefer it as a restaurant for obvious reasons--mainly the food! Whether you come here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, everything here is tasty and makes for a nice meal at an affordable price! Once you walk in, you order at the cash register, then a hostess with give you a number corresponding to your table.

To start, I love the breakfast here probably the most. Even though I'm rarely actually awake at breakfast hours, I love breakfast foods and Liberty Market serves it until 1pm on Saturdays and Sundays so I make it work when I'm in the area. My personal favorite is the Chilaquiles with either grilled chicken or green chile pork added. The green tomatillo sauce on them is the perfect combination of spicy, citrusy, and salty, and the green chile pork (which is also available in a scramble) is juicy and flavorful, making it a hearty addition. If you're looking for something more...standard (see where I'm going here?), the American Standard is a typical breakfast with eggs, potatoes, a biscuit, and your choice of breakfast meat, which should obviously be bacon, or their Pecan Sticky Bun is MASSIVE and will change your life.

For lunch/dinner, their wood-fired pizzas or burgers are the way to go. My favorites from the menu are the White Pizza (parmesan cream sauce, smoked mozzarella, grilled chicken, chopped bacon, arugula, pine nuts) and the Tower Burger (1?2 lb. local, natural fresh ground chuck, tomato, red onion, shredded iceberg, pickles, grilled Hawaiian roll, dip trio) with bacon or avocado. The White Pizza is an especially unique flavor combination, with the creamy alfredo-esque sauce, smoky mozzarella cheese, crispy bacon, and crunchy pine nuts. Finish it off with either the bread pudding or one of the dossants (special, only available on Tuesdays) but be prepared to share because the portions aren't messing around.

Overall, every experience I've had at Liberty Market has been a 5-star one from all the delicious food options to the quick, friendly customer service, to the decor and ambiance (even in the bathrooms--check them out)!"}
{"text":"Ok first off, this place gets rocked! Sunday afternoon the line is almost out the door and it's a long line on the inside. You will wait but I assure you that it will be worth it! Checked yelp for some places near the San Tan shopping area and this place came up. We really don't like trying new places because we are disappointed more often than not. So we get to the area and thought parking was going to be bad. But we easily found a space back off the road past the water tower and walked to the restaurant. Then whoa! Huge line! But the woman in front of us said we will love it. We waited about 20 minutes and that gave us time to look over the menu. So my wife ordered a caesar salad and a slice of Sicilian and I ordered the meatball pressed with potato salad and both meals were phenomenal. I can not remember the last time I was so impressed with the food at a place. You have to go here and try it out!"}
{"text":"If you grew up in Gilbert or a small town, this restaurant will bring back some nostalgic memories. Especially with the scent of cedar burning from Joe's BBQ from across the street.  I love this place, and I love the Maiden Lane sandwich even more,  but it's not on the dinner menu.  It's a  gourmet turkey sandwich and I usually get it on pressed bread. It comes with brie, red cabbage slaw, cranberry, & horseradish aioli. I also get it with a side of Roasted Sweet Potato Salad its INCREDIBLE and has a smokey-sweet-spice flavor to it.  They have endless fountain drink refills and a coffee bar with a variety of stong coffees & espresso.  They have a row of about 6 fully enclosed unixes bathrooms and a long sink area for everyone to wash their hands....it's a little corky. They also have patio seating - the last time I was there  (July 2014) they did not have misters but they do have heaters.   This place is not open late but they do serve alcohol."}
{"text":"I had the pizza and it was brick fired amazing! I look forward to going back and exploring more from the menu. Several great options and the burgers look delicious."}
{"text":"Well, this was my first time in Gilbert and my friend Amy took me here after we were off-roading all afternoon and it was nice to pull into this chill laid back spot.

They have a good selection of wine & beer and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced too.  I didn't get to try the carrot cake or red velvet cakes which looked delectable but heard that they both rocked so I'll have to check those out on my return visit whenever that might be..."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the service is always superb! We've eaten here two days in a row on this trip! And we will be back tomorrow again! Breakfasts are delicious. Sausage pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to Liberty Market several times now.  Good food, lines can be long, outside seating is pretty nice especially during the cooler months.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast, but i can without a doubt recommend it to anyone. Their potatoes are amazing and there eggs are the right consistency. All in all a wonderful place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"I just walked out of the restaurant and have to leave a review immediately. Oh my gosh. I got the farmers sandwich and rice pudding for my side and it is seriously the best thing ever. I have recently decided to stay away from me, and it has been fairly difficult to find yummy options at restaurants (or even at home for that matter). This meal seriously solved all my problems today. The service was great, the vibe was cool, and the price was decent. I cannot wait to bring my Husband here!"}
{"text":"Took my family here for the first time and it was delicious as always.  Restaurant was clean and the food came out fresh.  The best was the latte though.  The Batista took her time and knew what she was doing.  Great job on the foam and the design on top!  Definitely will be back.
I suggest the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo.  Yumm!"}
{"text":"Love this place new favorite. Went for my birthday and had some amazing chilaquiles with two eggs on top. For desert a huge cinnamon roll that filled the plate. Yum"}
{"text":"I places an order for the ranch roast beef, took one bite and literally spit it out! The redeeming factor was the waitress noticed and not only replaced my meal but gave me a gift card for the future. I must say customer service was amazing but not enough to keep me as I found the food disgusting on more than one occasion and over priced."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ this summer, Liberty Market has consistently produced a stellar dining experience. The chilaquiles is the best I've had since moving here. We've gone to other restaurants for the same dish, but NOTHING compares to Liberty Market's version of chilaquiles. The griddled bread pudding was a great surprise as well. I'm not a big miffin person, but everyone raves about rhe sweet potato muffin. The service is great and the restaurant is squeaky clean. If you want breakfast on Saturday or Sunday, get there early before the crowd or you'll be standing in line, literally."}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when this was a small grocery store. I've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by. 

It was perfect. This place just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order. 

I had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar. 

Loved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out. Joe was there and stopped by each table to see how everyone was doing. We spent so much time here chatting and catching up. It's a great place to come and hang out. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the long wait the place would be perfect. The staff are very causal and friendly, the food fresh and prepared to perfection. I really enjoy taking a break and having breakfast or lunch here. The prices are very fair and you get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Since discovering Liberty Market a couple of months ago, I'm pretty sure I've made a mortgage payment for Joe Johnston, the ever-present owner.

Breakfasts are great. I'm partial to the Western Scramble, but everything I've had has been very good, with large portions and served by attentive staff. They have some coffee drink, I can't ever remember the name, that comes in a shot glass and you have to stir it up. Delightful. Get two.

Lunches and dinners are also very good. The \"bowl of meat\" and the hamburgers are outstanding.

I've attended Liberty Market with just me and the bride, a small gathering of friends, as wall as with large groups and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"So I felt it necessary to re-review my go-to spot in downtown Gilbert! Being a transplant from Portland myself, you could say I was a little more than thrilled to find out they carried stumptown! My favorite is a shot of hairbender before I head off to work. 

On the food side of things, you cannot go wrong with their chilaquiles. Spicy, flavorful, and just downright delicious...this is what I get 9 times out of 10. Also, the service is on point! My favorite is this girl named Becca who no matter what can put a smile on my face. 

Anywho, Liberty Market is rad. Try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I had the fine pleasure of having a Monday off and decided to enjoy a great breakfast and Liberty Market was the place to go!!
Of all the great items on the menu, I went the Blueberry Pancakes and a Bowl of Mocha!! Yes, it was a bowl from one of the best coffee bars in the Valley!! If you're feeling adventurous, check out the pastries!! Great atmosphere for a sit down meal with family/friends or even alone people watching!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service. You need to try a Salt River Bar if you stop in. They are killer"}
{"text":"We went out with friends to celebrate a birthday. I have a friend who adores this place so expectations were high. (Thxs Jeff K) The food was great, loved my pizza and my wife's chicken sandwich. It was a little loud for talking. The coffee was great and the dessert real good. I would go back but probably later when there wasn't a big crowd."}
{"text":"I went here for a girls night dinner before attending a show at the Hale Theater. We showed up a little later than the rest of our party, who had already grabbed a table. When we got there, there was a long line and we were afraid that the others in our party would have to wait awhile for us to eat our meal. Well, there was no worries to be had, as one of the staff asked if the rest of our party was already seated, we said \"yes\" and she then brought us over to the coffee bar to order our meal, so our whole party could get their food at the same time. 

My friend and I split the Italia salad, white pizza, and red velvet cake. The italia salad was very flavorful with high quality salami, artichokes, chick peas, basil and a tasty lemon vinaigrette. The white pizza was very good, the cream sauce, bacon and pine nuts were a very good combo. The red velvet cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was delicious, very similar to La Grande Orange's. 

I recommend Liberty Market as their food, quality, and customer service were very good. It's too bad I don't live closer, as I would frequent this restaurant if I could."}
{"text":"I don't get the fascination with this place. It's crowded and loud and the food is overpriced."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place! Sitting at the E61 Bar is always a must -  faster service and it is fun to sit, relax and talk with the Baristas. I'm kinda obsessed with their chai latte, simply delicious. I really can't drink Starbuck's Chai lattes anymore because of how good it is here. Liberty's other lattes/ cappucinos/ etc are excellent! As far as the food goes...all of their menu is worth a try! My favorite, \"the Best Chicken Sandwich\"... is really the Best Chicken Sandwich :) I usually always order that if I eat lunch or dinner there. Their bean salad or fresh veggies of the day as a side is also a must :) Yummy! Amazing recipes!"}
{"text":"This place should be a case study of how a restaurant should be run. From the way they prepare to food to how they serve it, customer service, quality, amount, and prices of food, and atmosphere. Great."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. I really love the market blt and the salmon blt. I've also had the crab cake sandwich and the Cuban sandwich. Both of those were good too. I've tried a pizza before and enjoyed it.
My husband normally gets the tower burger or the burger of the week. The burger of the week can be pricey. This weeks burger was $15 and it only comes with chips. And the tower burger you have to pay extra for cheese and it also only comes with fries. 
Today I ordered the Caesar salad. I was not thrilled with it. The dressing tasted weird. Not like a traditional Caesar or any that I've had before. And it looked like it was made with ground mustard.  
Overall I'd recommend this place, just don't get the Caesar."}
{"text":"The food was good but a lady I assume was a manager was very rude. We had reservations. We asked a server where to sit and waited for our party. This lady said that we needed to move because we were in a reserved section. We told her we had reservations. She said she gave ours away and she would find something else for us. She said for future reference check with all manager before seating ourselves. I told her the waiter told us to sit there. She got snobby and walked away. 

We were there for breakfast. I had bread pudding french toast. A little sweet but delicious. 

Besides the one lady the servers were nice and helpful but she ruined the experience for us."}
{"text":"The chicken pasta and white pizza are what we order every time. Very good food! We used to get the carrot cake wedge, but they changed it up on us."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Celiac Friendly. The bread was amazing. Everything about this place shows why it is successful right up to the owner checking on our table to be sure everything was good. Service was excellent also. Don't forget the great list of desserts."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. The food is good and simple. I've always had great service. I've been there about 3 times for lunch and breakfast. My husband thought his dish needed more seasoning. He had the breakfast burrito. I had the pancakes and they were good. Try the bread pudding it's a must! delish!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow, must've been the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. The only reason this is 3 stars is because of the 6 times I had to rush to the rest room from the chorizo. The Salsa is fresh, fresh tortillas, just do yourself a favor and get the chicken instead! I'll still be back don't worry! For taste only I would give this a 5/5!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market deserves its 4 to 5 star rating. It's smaller than I was expecting, and fairly busy for a weekday lunch, but I ordered, got seated and served in a decent amount of time. This was my first time there and I enjoyed my Margherita pizza. Unlike a lot of restaurants that used \"wood fired\" as an excuse to burn their pizza crusts, Liberty Market cooked my pizza to perfection. I'll definitely return - their breakfast menu had some interesting items that I'd like to try. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I joined YELP specifically to write this review. We have been going to Liberty Market for years and I will NEVER visit again. Yesterday my husband took me there for lunch for my birthday. I am severely allergic to gluten, seeds and nuts and in the past this was not an issue at Liberty Market. I tried to make it as simple as possible when I ordered at the counter: Egg Salad with no bread. The lady told me no problem and we sat down. Ten minutes later we were brought our lunches, and sure enough, here was my Egg Salad on wheat bread. I explained that I asked for NO BREAD due to allergies, to which I was told, no problem again. The man came back with the Egg Salad AGAIN on bread. He told me it was gluten free bread, but I explained my other allergies and noticed the bread had seeds in it. I was told ok (he was irritated this time) and came back a few moments later with the egg salad in a bowl, which he had scraped off of the bread and put it to the side. I was so frustrated explaining AGAIN that if the Egg Salad touched the bread I would still have a reaction to the seeds and can they PLEASE just bring me the Egg Salad in a bowl.  He swiped it away from me very annoyed and brought a bowl back, saying (loudly) \"HERE. NO BREAD.\" As if I was causing this mess. I started to eat, thankful that was over, and then the man came back to our table with the package of bread and said, \"SEE? NO GLUTEN!!!\" I was so embarrassed and told me angrily that gluten was not my only issue which was why I asked for NO BREAD and to please stop upsetting me. He stormed away. I can't believe how I was treated, it's hard enough to eat out and I stick to places I know and trust. I did not need to be made to feel awful on my birthday about a food allergy. We will never visit Liberty Market again. And I highly recommend that anyone with a food allergy stays clear as well."}
{"text":"Very interesting.  Most unique dishes ever.  Fast service.  Great hangout.  Liked a lot"}
{"text":"I went here with my fiancé after wanting to try something new, and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise! Although very expensive, which is something to be expected when you're in Downtown Gilbert, Liberty Market has all the charm of an old diner with a fresh look all while serving some of your favorite comfort food. I had soup and a sandwich - a classic BLT kicked up a couple notches on panini bread. It was fantastic!  I paired it with their fresh broccoli and cheddar soup, which was amazingly fresh and wonderful. My fiancé had the Hot Cuban sandwich- which was ham, pecan smoked pork, provolone, red cabbage slaw, pickles, and spicy mustard aioli. She very much enjoyed it! We also had dessert, which was homemade oatmeal crème pie-  two oatmeal cookies with a cream cheese frosting in the middle, which was superb! The atmosphere here was very nice as we could hear ourselves talk while soothing music played in the background. I think the next time we come here I would like to come for dinner, as I couldn't justify a $33 price tag for lunch, which is my only complaint. Excited to return and try other things at this place!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfasts here, especially the burrito. The only thing that got this reduced stars is the waiting. There is almost always lines there, even weekdays, and you have to hunt for a spot to sit. This is part of the joes bbq and farm grill ownership (very good thing!)"}
{"text":"Food and coffee is over the top and delicious. Made fresh with local ingredients. They even serve a \"bowl of coffee\" which is one of its main attraction points. They are unique and offer a south west influenced breakfast menu. That's not to say they don't serve anything traditional because they do. The food was so good in fact that I pushed myself to eat it all even tho I was getting full. Next time I'm in the area I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have only been here a few times and don't have anything but positive feedback to give this place. They have everything you could ask for. If you are curious about what to get I would suggest getting their sandwiches and their pizza. The last time I went here I couldn't believe how amazing the pizza was, and the service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Thursday during restaurant week. Liberty Market is a stand in line to order kind of place. Then servers bring your food out either to a table you're assigned to while in line or if they aren't busy, one you pick. It was hopping and we ended up sitting outside. We were too close to the doors so there was pretty heavy traffic, but the food was good. I ordered the crab cakes and my partner got a Cobb salad. The food came out surprisingly fast. I was happy with the crab cakes--lump meat, no shell, curry sauce went surprisingly well. They weren't up to East Coast standards, but they were solid and the slaw was really good--warm and savory. My partner said his salad was good as well. His wine, a cab sav, was better than average. So here's my complaint. For $40+ for dinner for two, I want table service. The cashier talked me out of ordering a side salad. When I saw my crab cakes, I knew it wouldn't be enough food, but was too lazy to get back in line. My partner didn't want another glass of wine, but hypothetically he could have. I might have had a weak moment and needed that blueberry cheesecake in the cute little mason jar.  Liberty Market is losing out and I left hungry:("}
{"text":"My friends and I went for late night lattés. As I cannot have caffeine after 10:00am I ordered decaf. I always get nervous that I'll accidentally get served caffeinated. The barista made it a point to bring over the two caffeinated lattes first and keep my decaf separate so she was sure not to mix them. I very much appreciated this! I was able to enjoy my lattè without a doubt that it was possibly switched."}
{"text":"Love to come here fro brunch and get the Sicilian scramble with iced chai tea. The sticky buns, breakfast burrito, sweet potato muffin, and salt river bar (I think that's what it is called... flaky, chocolate, salt... yumm) are also delish. HUGE pancakes if you order just them.

The demi breakfast is smaller than it sounds like it will be, so heads up. Pancakes are smaller portions. 

Parking is horrible... as is anywhere downtown Gilbert. 

$10 birthday credit with ID!

Be sure to check out each restroom stall here if it's your first visit. Weird recommendation, but true!

Take the kids to play at the splash pad under the water tower after, and you have yourself a fun morning :)"}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market!  The food is exceptionally good, the atmosphere that of a small town, privately owned restaurant.  Friendly, consistent food.  May take some time to be seated but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love it here! The breakfast was great and everyone was super friendly. It was really busy but everyone made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for lunch and dinner. The ingredients are fresh and simple and any sandwich is a hit in my book. My favorite side here is the rice pudding, it makes for the perfect dessert after lunch. This place is hoppin' at noon when my coworkers and I show up and parking is limited in the direct vicinity. Going here or across the street to Postino is the way to go for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food. There really isn't another place in the valley like it. It tastes very fresh and the food is very unique. The grilled bread pudding is incredible. I highly recommend it to anyone.

Cons-
Coffee is below average.
You have to stand in line to order. We waited about 45 min in line on a Saturday morning. This means adding to your order ie. drinks is out of the question after you have paid. This also mans servers only deliver food them disappear. You are responsible for your own drinks and refills. Usually these cons would warrant a much lower rating, but the food really was good enough to make up for it.

Do not go if you are on any kind of time-constraints. Maybe a weekday would be better."}
{"text":"I love going to Liberty market for breakfast!  Their biscuits and scones are to die for!  The butter they serve with the scones is so light, fluffy and delicious.  I highly recommend trying a Spanish latte from their coffee bar.  Liberty Market is a consistent go-to for breakfast!  I have never been disappointed.  I also like the ordering line where you can watch the cooks at work!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in myself for not getting dessert or iced coffee, but i needed room for food. I think that should be an entire separate trip because the food was too good to stop myself. 

I even got to spot a little local celeb while there. Mr. Bianco himself. I tried to be sly and peek at what he was eating so that I could order it. You know it's good if he's eating it, right?! All I could tell was that it was a pressed sandwich for anyone curious. And I think he caught on to me being ridiculous because he started smiling. Or he wants to date me, in which case HAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY ;)

During my wonderful trip to Liberty I got to taste the hummus, sweet potato salad, pizza, the picnic sandwich, and the caprese sandwich.

first things first, i am going to spend now until november trying to make  that sweet potato salad. it was insanity. It was roasted and I could taste the garlic and there were craisins and oh my gosh. I need to figure out how to make it so that I can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner. with respect to liberty of course :)

second- how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe, red tomatoes, tons of fresh basil, divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles, granny apple slices, and candied pecans? both sandwiches were so amazing. my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner. so amazing. but that doesn't discount how awesome the picnic is, because that is amazing in it's own right. 

i've already figured out my next trip. instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner, we will order and split only one entree, one side and then we will have room for dessert. 

or i'll just go in and order a ton of desserts. whatever."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great meal, at a nice, clean, non chain restaurant in a great location, Liberty is one of many now in Old Town Gilbert. Portions are reasonable. My wife and I often share a meal. My favorites have to be the chicken sandwhich, cobb chicken salad and cauliflower mash. Im generally not a fan of carrott cake, but we have it everytime we dine here. It looks and tastes great. Not too sweet. We come here at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"What my wife wrote about our experience with the Liberty Market staff - She put it so well, I decided to share it. 

Where do I begin? We needed a spot for our rehearsal dinner, which after a couple inquiries I was starting to realize was turning into another mini wedding. Not only were most places ridiculous on \"catering\" for our group (since it was over 10 people I automatically was charged 50% more), but they were not responsive at all. We were eating lunch (Picnic Salad - my go to), and as I was gazing out at the Liberty patio, I was wondering...why don't we see if Liberty would host us? I never had seen a big party there since they are always packed but decided to try anyways.

Not only did I get a response in less than 24 hours, I was asked what I wanted for the event, not given a structured package that I had to adhere to. We worked with Willy, the GM through the entire process. When we were getting closer to the date, Willy was SO great on keeping on top of me and making sure that everything was ready for the night of. Planning the wedding, I was putting the rehearsal dinner on the back burner so was so relieved that he was keeping in contact so well.

We wanted to do a couple cute things like signing a champagne bottle and have pictures on the patio. All I had to do was drop off the decorations and the amazing team had it all set up when we got there.

The area was GORGEOUS. The patio was reserved for us and transformed into such a beautiful party for our family and friends. We were able to pick some items to make a smaller menu for our guests. We also were able to chose whatever wine we wanted and weren't charged up front for it like most places do.

I cannot even express how happy we were with William and his staff. The food was delicious, the atmosphere unbelievable and the over all night a success.

We had always loved coming to Liberty, but with the awesome customer service and friendly staff, we have now considered this a very special place that we hope to celebrate many more occasions at."}
{"text":"The food here is always on point. I have never been disappointed. Ever. Amazing daily specials. The service has always been phenomenal and it always is a pleasure to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is great. Took my wife and mother there this morning for breakfast. It's in old town Gilbert next to Oregano's and across from Joes real BBQ. Impressed with their expresso bar food and service. Highly recommend. Want to go back for lunch and/or dinner soon."}
{"text":"Man!!!!! Just talking about the pizza makes me want to have one right now! And the beers they have that goes with the burgers and pizzas are awesome. The coffee, Damn... forget about Starbucks! This is the real deal. Its a must go place"}
{"text":"After eating at Joe's Real BBQ about a gazillion times, I finally decided I ought to give Liberty Market a chance.  I remember growing up in Gilbert and always passing by this building in the historic part of town; back then it was actually a market.

The first thing I noticed is the interesting variety of options on the menu.  They have Mr. Pibb-marinated steak, burgers, pizza, sicilian pizza, salads, and even a chef's special paella with mussels, shrimp, scallops, chorrizo, a variety of dessert options, and more.  It was difficult to decide, to say the least.

I opted to have the white pizza and bread pudding.  The pizza was one of the most delicious I've had.  It was an amazing pizza.  So good that I'll have a difficult time trying something else next time I go there.

The bread pudding was bland.  The whipped cream was good, but the bread pudding itself was pretty flavorless.

The biggest gripe I have with this place is that it's a cafeteria style setup, but the prices are more in line with a sit down restaurant.  The service is pretty good, though.

It'll still be difficult to eat here with Joe's Real BBQ across the street, but I'll probably add it to my rotation."}
{"text":"I've been going to Liberty Market for a while, having everything from the meatball panini to the salmon plate. As great as the food is the atmosphere is even better. The culture of the people that come here is amazing, all very fun to be around. Customer service is top notch, it's great to hear words like \"absolutely\" \"you got it \" \"perfect\".

Bring your laptop, chill, get some work done, order some potato salad. 

Long Live Liberty Market!

AJ"}
{"text":"Order at the counter and they will give you a number and bring it out to your table. Went on a Sunday morning for coffee and ended staying for brunch. It wasn't too crowded at first but then the line got super long to place orders. There is lots of seating inside or outside. Coffee and food was all good."}
{"text":"After several trips to Liberty market I have debated about giving them between 3 and 5 stars and finally learnt my lesson about this place. Truth is, Liberty Market can be a great spot.. IF you come at the right time and order the right thing. Sure their menu is small yet diverse, but if this is your first time here, focus on their best sellers and NOT what you usually order at other places.

The time to come is lunchtime or an early dinner. Breakfast is not suggested just because there aren't a lot of menu options (besides their ONE bfast special), though it is great if you just come in for a ready-made pastry and a latte. In terms of food, I really suggest to focus on the sandwiches and pizzas as these are definitely their best sellers. As a health nut, I ignored this and ordered the italian salad and really regretted it- it was pretty bland in flavor, lame in content and overflown in mostly iceberg lettuce. No good.

The picnic sandwich, on the other hand, was surprisingly delicious. At a hefty $9 it is composed of roasted turkey, caramelized pecans, green apple, blue cheese, and a red pepper mayo. Its basically everything I want in a salad, but between two pieces of bread. The blue cheese with the sweet pecans are an amazing combo that help the lame roasted turkey meat to kick it up a notch. It is also incredibly filling, so I was able to eat half for lunch and half for dinner. As an extra, the sandwich came with a roasted sweet potato salad (containing dry cranberries and a really thin glaze). 

As an extra, I was incredibly surprised and disappointed at the \"roasted veggie side\". At $3 it basically came wit 2 half-Brussels sprouts and 2 miniature carrots. Are you kidding me? This ain't the freaking cordon blue, put more food on the freaking plate! Luckily, the veggies were ridiculously well made, but the portion size was definitely lacking.

Not everything is wonderful though. The round tables outside are almost too small for a party of 2- if barely fits the plates and just makes it awkward to share. Waiting in line for 20mins to order isn't my favorite thing either, especially since a server brings our food out anyway. The prices are pretty steep for a \"pay at the counter\" sort of place but overall, its a nice place to be. Just don't order salad."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $4 for a cup of chicken broth, by all means, this is your place. I was excited to try this place because I love Joe's BBQ. I heard that they gave you a free meal ($10) on your birthday so I thought that would be a good time to try it out. I was out with a friend and she watched our kids in the car so I could run in and get the food and take it back home. Well after I placed my order, the cashier  told me I could only get a birthday meal if I was eating it there, but that I could have a dessert free. She said they had been having problems with it and had to change the rule. So, I ended up feeling like an annoyance to them on my birthday. I waited 15 minute for them to scoop and package a bowl of tortilla soup and when I got home and tried it I was so disappointed! It had no chicken or vegetables in it! Seriously? $4 for a cup of chicken broth? I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time at Liberty and the last, it was expensive 29.00 for two people for a stack of pancakes with ice cold syrup and a side of 2 pieces of cold sausage, 2 scrambled ice cold dry eggs 1 saus. link and a dry biscuit, no butter/honey 1cup of regular coffee that they didn't bring the cup till after I got my breakfast and 1 apple juice. I think $29.00 is expensive for that plus it was all cold. When I told the waiter he responded with \"Oh my bad\" what the heck is that suppose to mean. Never again....."}
{"text":"This place can be summed up as being \"ok\" - came on a week day afternoon and it was completely packed out. There was no seating inside and we had to table stalk to find a seat before our food came. Another bummer is the lack of selection. I had a cheeseburger which was average, my husband'a sandwich came out wrong (but it was good even after we scrapped off what he didn't want) and our kiddos didn't even eat their food. On the up side their pastries are tasty! Another plus was that the staff is super friendly and were helpful in helping us get a table. 

Would we come back? We would give this place a try if we were back in this area of the Valley but we wouldn't drive over here. Maybe we will try dinner next time!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Liberty Market was definitely mixed up. Either I didn't understand their policies or I have overrated their service with a 3. 

We arrived near the end of lunch and the beginning of dinner service. Our reserved table for 12 was ready as promised but other than delivering our meal, that's the last we saw of the staff. We had to go ask for menus, drinks and orders. Is that the way they roll at Liberty Market?

The food was good. Fairly expensive but big portions. I paid $25 for a salad, burger and soft drink. I took most of my salad home cuz it arrived with my burger even tho I asked for it to arrive early. 

The atmosphere was tough for me to rate cuz we were put in a corner of the restaurant and my back was to the whole place. 

I may try it again but if my gluten-free wife joins me, we might have issues. Their GF menu consists of \"don't get a bun with your burger\" type, which is not GF friendly."}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to go before a show at the Hale Theater. Their salads are always so fresh and tasty. We had their white pizza this time and it was delicious. My granddaughter had the macaroni and cheese she said it was so cheesy and crunchy she love it. Got a snickerdoodle and some macaroons to eat during the intermission. Good food and the staff is always very attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The white pizza is so good!!  The only issue I have had is the apricot chicken is inconsistent in the flavor in the multiple times I have ordered it so I just stick to other menu items.  The manager, Julie, is one of the most competent and amazing managers I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"What an odd experience. :-/

I seriously dislike the waiting 20 minutes in an order line, getting seated, then waiting another 30 minutes for food after we were seated. Why not just take names like every other restaurant and seat people as the table opens up? My thought is that you're standing in line right next to the display cases the whole time, when it's your turn to order, you've been eying that slice of cake, scone, or other baked dessert for so long that you have no choice but to order it. Will power won out this time - no scone for me!

The food was decent and the service was also pretty good. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, being more in the average category than extraordinary, I don't think I would get it again. Having to serve my own drink from the fountain, waiting in line for so long to just make our order, getting taunted by all the baked goods, the general chaos of the place, and me personally living so far away (in downtown PHX), I can honestly say I'm not going to be making this a destination for dining. If you're close by and it's not a weekend, I imagine this spot is a lot less hectic and easier to deal with.

Happy Yelping Phoenix. See you on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I would eat here EVERY day if I could afford to! The fish specials are some of the best fish I've ever had. The sauces are delicious. Highly, highly recommend eating here as often as possible. 

The cafeteria style is a little strange, considering the cost of the menu items, but it works. It feels casual, and accessible with high end food and quality ingredients. 

Hands down, my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a colleague of mine on a Wednesday night. He had been here before and highly recommended it. He said that all of the food was very good. He was not wrong. I got the grill chicken pasta dish which some of the best Alfredo style chicken dish that I've ever had. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food. I came with my sister and she had the marguerite pizza, I had the Mac n cheese and we split both. More than enough food for two and a decent price. The three stars come from the waitress that blatantly ignored us not once or twice but FIVE times when she walked by our table and we asked for a box. Ridiculous. Also the location in downtown Gilbert makes parking almost not worth it."}
{"text":"Its very expensive, crowded and trendy (the way downtown Gilbert has become)."}
{"text":"First time been to this place recommended by my sister. We ordered an Antipasto Plate, Mocha cream bread pudding, lavender orange macarom and a CaPhe. The food and dessert taste excellent and come in nice presentation. Drinks, especially the coffees are in such tiny portion. 
Nice inside atmosphere with enclosed outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I ordered to go from here a week ago and had time to calm down and I am still pissed about this place. Don't order to go from here at all, they got our order completely wrong. We ordered pancakes, and didn't receive any. We ordered biscuits and gravy and got no gravy! And this after going out of the way 15 mins to get there."}
{"text":"Great food, cool environment. I especially love their carrot cake. Even a fun restroom. Fun place for dessert and coffee bar"}
{"text":"Breakfast is WONDERFUL - no one can match their pancakes!  I've only dined for dinner once, and had a special that was absolutely delicious!  Great coffee . . . great food!  Location is right in Old Town Gilber, perfect.  And on Saturdays catch the farmer's market next door after eating! I like to sometimes just sit at the bar and work on my computer, and on other occasions, I enjoy dining at a table with friends or family.  It's laid back, sometimes long lines, but always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at a fair price.  
Old Town Gilbert.  Nice atmosphere.  
As far as I can tell, this is NOT a chain

Went here for lunch with family and friends.  Timing was excellent as the place was not as crowded as other comments mentioned.  

I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"Wow. Their sales are amazing. Very fresh food and decent prices. I heard good things about his place and they did not disappoint. Place was packed and for good reason."}
{"text":"This Restaurant was recommended to me by a friend and locals in the area to try out and they talk was all about the  item menu \"Best Chicken Sandwich\", so I did just that. I tried it...

I was first happy to see a nicely presented sandwich, open face and ready to enjoy. The food \"looked\" great and that's about as far as it goes.

The chicken was served ad a thick breast which I despise. Any chicken sandwich served should be opened and thinned. It will cook faster, have more juice and be much more palatable. Biting down on a thick chunk of chicken meat makes me want to go vegetarian. Serving it dryer than the Phoenix asphalt in July is even worse. The tomatoes were obviously kept for too long in the fridge before serving as they were not firm but mushy with tough skin. The seasoning was so-so. Best part of the sandwich was the bread. It was fresh and nicely toasted.

The Burgers looked good that were passing by, but for 9 bucks + 1.50 for bacon and another buck for an additional item and all you get is kettle chips on the side, I might as well go to Red Robin for a Banzi burger loaded up and get free fry refills to boot.

Other items on the menu looked very good and I will give it one more try to see if the salads measure up to their description.

Until then, Don't Order the Chicken!

Peace..."}
{"text":"It was a pretty busy lunch crowd but the staff handled it like pros. Everyone was friendly and upbeat, including the customers. It was our first time here so we would need to try a few more entrees. The salad of the day was a kale salad that was excellent and very fresh. The Sicilian pizza was good but could've been warmer. The Farmer sandwich had quality ingredients and good flavor. Charming area and tasty restaurant. We will be back to try other entrees."}
{"text":"With over 1000 reviews for this place, there really isn't much I can add about the food. I love that they have gluten free bread and buns. The food was so much better than I expected... well seasoned and good temp. 

The part that I'm just super intrigued about is the unisex bathrooms. I like the idea of unisex bathrooms anyway... but these individual stalls were so well designed...

I have a digestive disease so bathrooms are important to me. Haha

I like that they have individual stalls with music and artwork and each has its own in and out vents and vacant notices on the door versus knocking... it's probably the best bathroom set up I've seen."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a great place in downtown \"Historic Gilbert.\" As far as I'm concerned this place fits right in to the ambiance of downtown Gilbert. You wait in line to order, which is a bit different, and the line for brunch can get long. The other quirky thing is if you're in a group they would like you to order all at once so you get one number per table. 

A little funny I think, but it's casual, delicious and well worth the wait. I had the Grilled Vegetable Scramble, and the veggies were cooked to perfection. Not soggy, over done, or underdone. Which is fabulous! The atmosphere is quite nice, with all the big windows that look over the beautiful downtown Gilbert area. Parking is also plentiful.

Funny note: bathrooms are amusing, you have to check them out."}
{"text":"Mrmhrmmehfhe.  Sorry, I started this review while still eating.  Ok, not really because nothing was going to tear me away from my meal.  

I have never been let down by the food at Liberty Market, and when another place didn't work out, I dragged my friend here for her first visit.  

They were packed, but that didn't stop the staff from being super friendly and taking the time to answer all of our questions.  After securing a seat, it was only a short time before our meals were delivered and the nom nom nom commenced.  I actually don't think we talked much during the meal at all, we were more interested in eating!

I had a juicy Tower Burger while my friend got the Grilled Chicken Pasta.  We were both impressed with the serving size, but it wasn't obscene like some places - filling and just enough that we were full but not uncomfortable.

I only wish I had room left for dessert."}
{"text":"Although this Market is named after a WNBA team, don't knock it. 

This place gets super busy, but you won't find a Black Friday type of line here no matter how busy it gets because there is plenty of indoor seating and some outdoor seating. Also, there is always someone monitoring the order line to make sure you will have a place to sit. The service here is top notch, everyone smiles and makes sure you are taken care of. 

If you come with someone, I highly suggest splitting your entrees so you can get a variety of tastes. If you are pizza-ophile, you should definitely try the WHITE pizza...which has parmesean sauce, grilled chicken, arugula, pine nuts and smoked mozzarella...it usually comes with chopped bacon but we got it without. This pizza is quite filling and if you want something that wont weight you down like kim kardashian's backside, then i highly suggest the good ole Margherita pizza, which comes mozarella and basil. It's pretty basic, but it doesn't really matter how simple food is as long as the ingredients are fresh and it tastes good. 

I've also had their Best Chicken Sandwich, which is grilled chicken, spicy avacodo, monterrey jack cheese, tomato and chipotle vinagarette. There is a lot going on in this sandwich, but it came together pretty well. This is one of those sandwiches where you eat the first 50% and you're like, \"wow this is really good,i wont dare share this with anyone.\" But then when i got to the last 15%, I was like, \"eh, you started out really good, but i'm kinda over you.\" aka the chris brown effect. 

Great atmosphere, great value for your buck, and overall perfect place for a weekend lunch."}
{"text":"Must try the PIZZA! Awesome variety of food options. Sweet coffee bar! Come checkout Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The breakfast is so yummy. I love the Cuban coffee, I just had the cortado and it was perfect. The biscuits are the best, I drizzled some honey it and honestly it was unbelievable. This weekend the weather was beautiful and we were able to enjoy the patio which was enjoyable. You will not regret your decision to try this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious 3 course meal for Restaurant Week, my favorite were the medjool dates wrapped in bacon and the homemade Hostess cake. You can never go wrong with the sides and the scones!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed but tried going three different times. Food is ok service is fair and cost is a little much for what you get."}
{"text":"My car just automatically turns in when I see Liberty market, always a treat."}
{"text":"Enjoy that you pay first before you eat so it makes splitting checks super easy. The cute market decor makes it feel like you are in a grocery store. Food was good, took a while to get but I came on a Friday night so that might be why. Service was friendly and I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market! Their food is fresh, creative, and always delicious. I love the atmosphere too. Typically my favorite part of the meal is dessert and I'm not always big on sweets. Their Salt River Bar paired with a fresh latte from the espresso bar is to die for. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu of different choices of food right here in the little town of Gilbert. Liberty Market gets crowed early but it's so worth the wait. We ate on the patio tonight surround by beautiful suculant plants.  Huge portions and a very attentive staff.  I can't wait to try Liberty Market for breakfast."}
{"text":"The service is appalling and the food mediocre at best. Food servers with facial hair that makes it's way into the painfully average food. The food is not worth the hour 10 minute wait. Snooze is a much better option."}
{"text":"For the most part, the atmosphere, food, service and location are up to snuff. I always enjoy the Picnic Salad but the grilled cheese sandwich was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"my favorite place for coffee and good breakfast. always have a good selection of deserts and lunch/dinner as well! ambience is great and nice people....goes a long way. Don't miss out on the food at this downtown gilbert staple."}
{"text":"Since downtown Gilbert has BLOWN up with new restaurants and new age dining, I'm so happy that Liberty Market is still around and kicking better than ever before. This place combines comfort with classy. I can walk in dressed up or in sweats, and I feel right at home. I love the feel of it. And if you haven't seen the crazy creative gender-neutral bathrooms yet, you might have to pop in just to take a gander at those. 

Now let's get down to business. The food here is absolutely delicious. I don't think I've ever come here and had a bad plate. From the salads, to the desserts, to the pizzas, to the chef's specialities, it's all good. Last time I was here I had the chef's prosciutto pizza and it was SCRUMPTIOUS. And I love how the portion sizes are just big enough for you to take some home and eat more for lunch the following day. But not overwhelmingly big.  

And finally. THE RED VELVET CAKE. Basically a baker's dream come true. I highly recommend that to anyone who claims to be a cake connoisseur like myself. With this beautiful restaurant also supplying vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options, you bet your bottom dollar that this place has a reason to ring out LIBERTY and FREEDOM for all!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Cool vibe and decor. The wait time in the middle of lunch time was a little long so don't go if you're in a hurry (or perhaps call ahead). I had the Italia salad and it was delicious! If I ever come back to Gilbert, I'll be stopping by Liberty Market!"}
{"text":"Great specialty sandwiches and salads in downtown Gilbert.  The meatball sub was excellent!  Great place!"}
{"text":"My wife has been wanting to try this place for some time now so we decided to meet 2 friends of ours there on Sunday for brunch.  I was not as thrilled to try this place because I thought it was going to be yet another typical breakfast place just like all the rest.  I just hate going out to battle the Sunday breakfast crowds just to have the same ole' omelet or other run-of-the-mill breakfast item that tastes the same as every other place.

I convinced myself that the parking situation was going to be a complete clusterfuq like it is at just about any other trendy breakfast spot in Scottsdale, but it was quite the opposite.  There is ample free parking and we found a spot without hassle.  I was surprised to see that the area actually wants people there instead of making it a complete pain to visit like some areas up north.  It just pisses me off when the idiots of Scottsdale rope off 100 more parking spots then they need and use it for valet parking.  Ok, my rant is over.

Anyway, upon arrival at the Liberty Market there was a giant line and the place was real busy.  I expected this but was a bit pissed.  Luckily our friends saved us a place in line so it wasn't that bad.  I would advise coming as early as possible to avoid any crowds.  We ordered our food, took our seats and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food.  A bit long but it was expected because of how busy it was.

Their breakfast menu is not huge and had the staples as well as some unique items on it.  I ordered the Western Scramble and it was excellent!  I love meaty and cheesy when it comes to eggs and this was perfect.  I was a bit skeptical of the horseradish sauce that comes with it but I think it actually makes the meal.  It was an awesome combination.  My wife ordered the grilled vegetable scramble with egg whites and it was excellent as well.  We especially enjoyed the fresh biscuit and honey that came with our meals.  I also recommend the scone which our table shared.  The scones come with a side of fresh whip cream which was delightful.

Anyway, I was a big fan of the breakfast and would definitely come back if I am in the area again come breakfast/brunch time.....or maybe even lunch time because their salads and sandwiches looked great!

I am a big fan of that little stretch of Gilbert Road and there are a few other places along it I would like to try in the near future.  I can't wait to go to Joe's BBQ which is right across the street."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning for brunch, we waited a bit to order and get our food, but it was so organized and the system they use for ordering (while you're in line, someone assigns you a table, after you order they escort you to your table and then bring you your food when it's ready) and food delivery is so smooth you don't sweat it. I ordered their specialty pizza slice (GREAT!) and my husband had an egg/breakfast meal, I tasted and it was delicious. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is consistently fantastic.  Lunch favorite is picnic salad. Dinner favorite is the Salmon special they have occasionally.  Never disappointed"}
{"text":"I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!"}
{"text":"Note:  Only the E61 Espresso Bar is being reviewed here

My girl friend and I sat at the bar on a busy Saturday afternoon after lunch down the street at Romeo's Bistro.  Having heard that Liberty was pulling Stumptown's Hairbender espresso blend,  I had to give it a try.  And I have to say,  the Faema, the barista, and the blend did not let me down.  It was a acid bomb; orange marmalade and lemon up front.  As it cooled, a semi sweet chocolate rounded the predominate citrus notes, leaving a long finish.  My only complaint is the espresso was too hot.  As a barista I struggle with this as well.  And maybe I'm just sensitive to this because I really dislike drinks that burn the tongue.  To the barista's credit,  he tried to combat this by flushing the group head for longer than I have ever seen anyone do,  rarely half a minute.  Bravo for doing your best to combat the difficulties of old machinery!

Side Note: The barista informed me that Hairbender is only used in their traditional espresso drinks. I find this strange but am not bothered by it because, to be honest, these are the only espresso drinks I enjoy."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! After convincing the husband that he would NOT have to turn in his man card for eating here, he is now a fan as well! We LOVE splitting a breakfast quesadilla on the weekend, we are always shocked at the huge line next door for another restaurant, when there is such great food here."}
{"text":"Gilbert is an up and coming suburb with new buildings and neighbors.  However when you go to old town Gilbert to eat at Liberty Market, you find yourself transported to the \"olden days.\"  The area gives you a feel of what Gilbert was like decades ago.  Liberty Market provides fresh ingredients obtained from local markets.  I was told that they even have a garden of produce for their meals.   Below are some of the great dishes I've had the restaurant.

Salmon BLT
What a great twist on a classic sandwich.  I'm usually not a big fan of salmon, mainly because if cooked wrong, it can taste bland and dry.  However this grilled salmon was flaky, soft, moist, and melted in my mouth.  All the ingredients complemented each other and my taste buds were happy.   

Caprese Salad
Who knew a simple salad could taste so good.  Caprese is simply just mixed green, mozzarella, and tomatoes.   The large chunks of tomatoes and mozzarella gave a wonderful presentation to the platter.  The main thing I thought that set this salad apart was their balsamic vinaigrette.   The sweetness of the vinaigrette contrasted with the tangy tomatoes.  It's sweeter than the normal balsamic vinaigrette and a bit thicker than what I'm used to.  However that's the beauty of it.

Bread Pudding
This tastes essentially like a moist cake with real whipped cream.  A great dessert should satisfy my sweet tooth, but not so sweet that I can't take more than a few bites.  And this bread pudding gives me that please.  Great for a snack or to cap off a great meal to tend to your sweet tooth.  


Great food, interesting ambience, and be a part of the \"eat local\" crowd with Liberty Market.  Don't forget to try their variety of coffee selection.   A great place to come back to again and again."}
{"text":"Love it.  The food is great.  Cool vibe.  Go during the week when it's less busy.  The weekends it gets crazy busy, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went with the family for dinner on a Saturday evening.  The food was fantastic, and all of the employees we encountered were friendly and helpful.  We tried four different entrees along with four different desserts and it was all very good.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was due to the prices.  It was maybe a little high for a family of four.  Our meal was $80 before dessert, which was another $25.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't review the basic food but we got our wedding cake from there and they have the best red velvet cake EVER!  The frosting is so good and not over powering like some cream cheese frostings can be. Can't wait to visit again so I can try the other food."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great staff! vegan and veg friendly. One of the best places to grab a bite in old town Gilbert."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE coming here for birthdays! They are always the sweetest to us and our children! Such yummy desserts and treats, and the nicest staff ever!!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant a lot!  

It's always super delicious and worth the wait! 

I love the atmosphere and you can't go wrong with anything ordered.  So delicious! 

I also like how they do special menu items"}
{"text":"Went witha good friend and ordered a white pizza and caprese salad.  All I can say is, delicious!"}
{"text":"The staff here are the nicest people on the planet. Seriously. Helpful, sincere, sweet - they really seem to like being in the restaurant business, and business looks to be good. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. The food is great, they have tons of creative choices and the quality is uncompromising."}
{"text":"If there's one place I miss in Arizona it's definitely Liberty Market. Part of the burgeoning Downtown Gilbert restaurant scene, Liberty Market is a fresh and relaxing restaurant with a delicious and diverse menu. Though I tend to order the same items (the Far East salad and the zebra brownies), everything I've ever eaten there was delicious. The staff is always friendly as well. Can't wait to go back when I visit AZ in December."}
{"text":"Liberty Market never disappoints. I decided to plan a lunch at Liberty Market for my moms group and much to my surprise 25 moms with 25 babies rsvp'd. I called ahead and got in touch with Kiersten who graciously agreed to accommodate our group. Although they don't take reservations, they did reserve two big tables for us. They also made a \"stroller parking\" sign outside for us. As always, the food and the staff were great!"}
{"text":"A great, trendy little place. A tad overpriced though. However, the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here and I keep meaning to go back. The long wait in line would have been bad, but at least we were right there watching the kitchen. Once we ordered, it didn't take too long to get our food, it was worth the wait. Everything we ordered was excellent. Makes me wish I ended up in Gilbert more often..."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Gilbert. Food is great and the customer service is spectacular. I always get their Cuban sandwich and it's always phenomenal!  Definite a place to visit and I would consider myself a regular to this place. I will never get tired coming here."}
{"text":"Flatbread pizza was not bad but there are better choices if that is what you want to eat. The egg salad sandwich looked delicious so I may have to go back and try it. Please know this is a semi-fast food type restaurant.  You order your food and pay at the register and have a seat. You get a number to place on your table and they bring your food to you.  Also self serve drinks.  Menu has salads, sandwiches, pizzas for lunch.  Heard breakfast is good but haven't tried it yet. Very casual and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast! We've only ever been here for breakfast and love the choices."}
{"text":"We use yelp soooo much that I had to write about this.  

We went on a Thursday eve early.  It was not busy at all.  We ordered margherita pizza and wet pizza.  Took along time had to ask for tea and lemon.  Once the pizza was brought to our table it was Luke war, and looked as if it was sitting awhile.  I would think that a 900 degree oven would produce very HOT pizza.  Well that was not the case.  Kind of disappointed to horrible just bad.  Could have been so much better.  Soooo as to all the fellow yelpers if you go I hope your experience is better.  We won't be going again.  35 dollars too.  Very expensive."}
{"text":".What can I say that hasn't already been said?

Oh maybe this: The CLEANEST, COOLEST bathrooms I've ever seen!  All stalls are like separate rooms, with soothing music playing."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS is the word that comes to mind! Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Not a sit down service restaurant -you order at the counter and they bring out your food. Sometimes the line can be quite long, but it goes fast and it is worth the wait. If you want something to hold you over grab a cup of coffee at their espresso bar before you get in line. 

I don't eat meat, but I have heard from friends the meatball sub is amazing! A few of my personal favorites are the vegetarian pizza, the breakfast burrito & the egg salad sandwich. 

If its a nice day, request a seat on their outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Liberty market makes America proud. Innovative staples line the menu and you can't go wrong with a pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is creative, historic, and absolutely amazing food. It will be top quality every time. Healthy and good tasting. Just had the smothered burrito. You will have to come and try. Oh and don't for get to check out the cool bathrooms!!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale, urban and very clean.  Food very nicely done and tasty.  Fair price and pleasant staff. One thing that could use some improvement was their expresso.  It was bitter and lacked richness.  They have a bakery area and the goods looked decadent and professionally prepared.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Even with all the new restaurants in Gilbert the Liberty remains my favorite. The Miso crusted cod that I ordered last night was amazing. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Living in Los Angeles, my husband and I come to this restaurant every time we visit family in Gilbert. Why? The Cortado. This expertly crafted espresso drink hits the spot every time we order it from the well trained baristas.

The coffee is amazing and the food is just as fantastic. I typically order the demi-breakfast with a blueberry pancake. Everything is fresh and expertly made. My husband swears it's the best biscuits and gravy he's ever had (I would have to agree). Lunch has delicious salads, although I typically split a pizza with someone. Much of the produce is picked locally at Agritopia in Gilbert.

The atmosphere is relaxed, casual, but a tad upscale. You can tell that the designer of the interior paid special attention to details. There is free wi-fi, and if I actually lived in Gilbert, I could see this as a regular hang out spot. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. You can tell that the customer is their number one priority.

On a side note, I drove to Gilbert for my birthday just to experience the birthday trifecta - $10 to spend here at Liberty Market, Joe's BBQ across the street, and Joe's Grill in Agritopia. A perfect foodie birthday!

I would really like to attend one of the community dinners that are held monthly at the restaurant, but I haven't been in town. The menus are custom made for each event by the executive chef. 

You won't regret stopping by!"}
{"text":"Ok, so walking in the front door, you pass the patio which is packed and you are greeted by a line, out the door, of hungry folks! The line moves slowly, as you peruse the menu. You are then approached by a very pleasant young lady who inquires as to the number of people in your party, hands you a laminated number and tells you she will reserve a table for you and place the corresponding laminated number on your table. You reach the front of the line, order your food, and take a seat at your table. After a wait, your food is brought to the table. One bite into the food and you find that the process was well-worth the wait!! We had the burger, grilled cheese and fingerling potatoes - absolutely outstanding food!! Definitely a spot where we will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Cute and hip, but not the greatest food. And the bathroom setup is not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"A lot of people love this place. I only like it. Overall, great food; but I've never had my socks knocked off by anything I've ordered. Better than average food, but not quite superstar status. Nice ambiance. Polite staff."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite East Valley Restaurant.  The staff is always friendly and professional, the food is always delicious, the place is clean, and I love the vibe!   I can't get enough of their sweet potato salad, and the baked goods are amazing!"}
{"text":"Sorry Joe today was a huge disappointment I took our friends from pennsylvania here today for breakfast telling them how great your establishment is we went and ordered and had a seat our breakfast came in a reasonable amount of time ,unfortunately to start with I ordered the sausage gravy and got the two turkey sausages not a big deal ,but my guests egg were barley warm so she sent them back to be rewarmed as they took her eggs I took a bite of my eggs to find them the same as well as the potatoes so when the wait person returned with the rewarmed and now a bit dry eggs I sent my breAkfast  back and waited a good 5minutes for my breakfast to return put down in front of me and watched the waitress scoot away briskly just to find the eggs and potatoes still the same temp as when I sent them back and now the sausage gravy she brought me earlier had cooled down  the guy next to us was going through the same issues after he sent his dish back he got up about 7or 8minutes later to go find where his breakfast had disappeared to.      wow. It was a tough day at the liberty market as you can tell from my earlier reviews your restaurant has always been in our top breakfast places hopefully you can relay this issue to your staff .......ps we never saw our wait person again to check in with us to make sure we were now satisfied with our meals"}
{"text":"I order the apricot chicken dinner and my wife had the salmon dinner.  My dinner came with grilled veggies and mashed sweet potatoes, which were ok but the 3 star was the chicken.  It was very dry and I had to chew it and add mashed potatoes to help with the dry taste.  I usually come here for breakfast but thought I'd try dinner here rather than zin burger. I wished the chicken was juicer, need a better chef."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Liberty Market since it first opened. They have excellent food and an awesome atmosphere. The place is very trendy and nice. They have amazingly delicious cinnamon rolls and they are big enough to share! Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by one evening to see if Liberty Market lived up to hype we've read/heard about. Unfortunately,  our experience was mediocre at best. We ordered the appetizer Pizza and shared a Greek burger. The 'pizza' was no more than some bland flat bread with the lightest sprinkling of cheese (it became clear why the woman taking our order tried so hard to push an order of hummus with the pizza). The burger was juicy, but nothing special.  I may be back to try the baked goods."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! The food is amazing and they serve so much I'm so glad I found this place. I'm cuban and their coffee is to die for!"}
{"text":"We've been to Liberty Market a half a dozen times. Two of those six visits we experienced, what i consider to be, poor service.

Overall the food here is wonderful, the prices are higher than average, at least the quality of food lives up to the prices.

The fact that there are no waitresses helps keep the overall cost down.

HOWEVER, regarding the 5.00 piece of Red Velvet Cake:

My wife and I visited at night for a slice of cake and coffee, it was wonderful.

So wonderful on our next visit, we ordered another piece of Red Velvet cake to go. Later that evening, upon diving into the cake, we noticed it was dry. We assumed it was cut from the end, resulting in dryness from the one exposed side.

On the next visit, we ordered a piece of Red Velvet cake and I noticed it was pre-cut and sitting in \"to go\" containers. The whole cake was there, but the slice they gave us was pre-cut.

I also noticed the bottom layer of the cake was a different shade of red than the other two layers. I notified the hostess, told her of our previous experience, to which she replied \"well, sometimes when people take the cake home and refrigerate it they confuse the coldness for dryness\". She proceeded to fetch us two forks to \"test\" the cake. She put the forks on our table and walked off...NEVER TO RETURN. 

First, I never said we refrigerated the previous piece of cake, because we did not. Secondly, we know our way around cake. Thirdly, when considering a FIVE DOLLAR SLICE OF CAKE, if I ask for a fresh cut piece, I better get one! NO QUESTIONS ASKED. 

We spent $30 for two entrees, one drink and one slice of cake. That's a lot of \"cake\" in order to receive a slice of cake with less than grocery store freshness.

Our other previous negative experience was similar, we asked to substitute macaroni salad for potato chips (due to food allergy issues), they refused, saying they could charge us the $2 for the single scoop of macaroni salad, we refused.

To their credit, Joe (the owner) was there, he came by and asked us how our meal was, we told him of our experience. He immediately jumped behind the counter and fetched the macaroni salad.

Moral of the story...in my book Premium Prices dictate Premium Service...Liberty Market has the premium price part down, better than average on the premium food part...HOWEVER, on the premium service part...they fail, over and over again."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert has so many options now.   Liberty market has held its own first class!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best coffee...great atmosphere!  Nice people!  Enjoying Gilbert!  So over Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Have lunch here at least once a month, love the burger of the week. Have tried the coffee and the swan song. Only problem is they don't offer once it off the week."}
{"text":"Pretty good I have to say. Always busy, always packed, even during the week. Odd set up for a restaurant, I didn't know who to tip in the end."}
{"text":"Cute little spot in downtown Gilbert. 

I wasn't prepared for it to be more like a cafeteria but with really nice food. You place your order at the counter, the hostess finds you a table and then they bring things out to you.

We had the short rib special which was delicious. Really rich with a great sauce and house made noodles.

The Italian Salad was also good. Nothing super special but good and a really hefty serving.

In fact, all the servings were really well sized.

All in alla great place for a family dinner. Especially is your family is like mine and nobody can decide on a particular cuisine. Liberty Market had something for everyone."}
{"text":"Been hearing quite a buzz about this place recently and finally got the chance to try it on my own. Concept is pretty much like all the other Joe's restaurants, you order at the counter and go find a seat. 

We got a tower burger and a sausage pizza to share. Burger was great. Juicy, meaty, and well seasoned. I also loved the pineapple relish that came on the side as part of the trio dip. Other two dip was ketchup and chipotle mayo/thousand island? or something that I didn't care too much for. We subbed the side of kettle chips for swt potato salad ($1 extra) which was pretty good. Kinda, sorta like candied yams but not as sweet. Pizza was eh. Could've used a bit more oven time to get some charred wood fire taste. I didn't really like the ricotta on the pizza either. Don't think I'll be trying pizza here again. 

I can't decide if I really liked the place or not. The burger was good but they also have good burgers at Joe's Farm Grill. I think I'd drive a bit further to Farm Grill because I also like the pizza better there."}
{"text":"We were in town this weekend for business and decided to stop in for a bite before hitting the road back home. Oh my, what a treat!! The hubby and I tried the rib eye sandwich as well as the crab po' boy and both were very good. But the real kicker were the rice pudding and oatmeal whoopie pie we had chosen for dessert. As a self proclaimed foodie these were easily two of my favorites I've had the pleasure of enjoying! The pudding was decadent and just yum, and the cookie in the whoopie pie was amazing without being overly sweet. Totally coming back here next time we find ourselves back this way!"}
{"text":"A fantastic blend of eclectic atmosphere, inventive menu, and world-class execution--that's Liberty Market in a nut-shell. The line may be long, but it's absolutely worth the wait! By the way, don't forget your camera. The surrounding Gilbert historic district is full of great backgrounds..."}
{"text":"Stop what you are doing right now, drive to Liberty Market and try their BREAD PUDDING.  Ok, I don't typically like Bread Pudding.  It has a bunch of raisins in it (not my thing) and it's usually a bit dry and uneventful.  The Bread Pudding at Liberty Market is moist, flavorful and topped with delicious fresh whipped cream, it's absolutely amazing!  The waiter even did a little song to accompany it's grand entrance.

Service has been great on the two times I've been there.  Their bathrooms are awesome and unisex (so European, ha ha) and on both occasions that I've eaten there the food has been delicious and fast."}
{"text":"Liberty Market just has the freshest ingredients!  You can literally see how they make and prepare your food in their open kitchen!  The service is very friendly and efficient.  My son loved their Smoked Salmon plate for both breakfast and for lunch.  I had the Caprese salad with a side of sweet custardy bread pudding!   Whenever I look forward to the dessert, I almost usually order salad for dinner.  I guess that cancels the calories out...my own theory, anyway.  My husband had the Salmon BLT and enjoyed it.  We're disappointed with their pizza, though.  Thus 4 stars instead of 5.   The Sicilian is so doughy and too thick and lacked any taste whatsoever.  My son did not like it at all.  Tonight I figured their wood fired pizza would be better, but didn't pass my son's test.  He said it had too much parmesan.   He cracks me up.  He prefers more fresh mozzarella.  It also lacked the zing in their sauce.  Not a very good left over either because it fell apart and got really soggy.  Their Asian Salad is great topped with beets...with a side of chocolate cupcake.   They don't sell much in their market or it's seasonal items only.    NO KIDS MEAL, but they have a few kid friendly on their regular menu.  Great neighborhood place to eat!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW! They the salt river bars. They are bommmbbbb! Great place for any meal. It is a tight squeeze inside, so if you have a stroller or wheelchair it's not very easy to get in."}
{"text":"I'm not completely sure how I feel about this place. I love the atmosphere and service is decent counter service, but the food & drinks are just meh. Nowhere I'd go on my own, but am there regularly due to friends' suggestions."}
{"text":"Tried the white pizza recently and it was very very tasty. Thin crust, white sauce, bacon, pine nuts, and arugula. The pine nuts could be left off as I didn't feel they did much for the flavor. All in all, very good pizza. One more thing to decide amongst when coming here..."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend who stated \"You HAVE to try their bowl of coffee!!!\" Bowl of coffee? So we did and I have to say it was great. Anytime we want to get away for a nice cup of coffee with out the commercial big box coffee company feel this is where we head. In my opinion there is no better time to go than in the early spring or late fall when you can chill out on the quaint patio and enjoy a warm bowl of coffee.

They have what tastes like homemade vanilla or chocolate whipped cream to top off your coffee if you like. It's always a good good choice in my opinion!

The food is fairly good and the prices are OK but it depends on the person & budget. Either way, we keep heading back and love to support the local business.

It's a great choice to relax and enjoy the coffee shop for what it is... cozy."}
{"text":"I eat at Liberty Market because I like the charm of Downtown Gilbert and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The staff is very polite, but the food is just mediocre.  I always bring a group with me on my birthday as birthday guests receive $10 off their meal.

The last time I visited, I ordered the margarita pizza (as I usually do).  For some reason, it just didn't taste the same.  Perhaps it was just me, but it seemed like something was different and not in a good way.  Either way, I will return again because like I said, I enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! And if it's your birthday, they will give you $10 off your meal-show them your ID and enjoy the gift!

There can be a long line, but it's worth it. They'll save a table for you, which is nice too. Wile you're waiting in line you can peruse the menu,  watch them prepare the wood fired pizzas, see the cold case side items, and drool over the desserts. You'll order at the front, get a number and they'll deliver your meal to your table. 

Best meal ever in Two words- white pizza. Seriously! If you haven't tried it, DO! you'll thank me! The manager comped it to me one time years ago, and I've been hooked ever since. My friend calls it her \"last rites\" meal- and I completely agree. It'd be the meal I request on my death bed! It's THAT good! Smokey, rich and so other-worldly good! I dream of that pizza!

The carrot cake is a nice dessert-my annual bday splurge. Yummy and celebratory for sure!!

They don't have kids meals per se, but have grilled cheese and burgers that can easily be split for the kids. Breakfast is pretty tasty too, but seriously, when that white pizza is around, what else could I choose?

Love it here, and can't wait for our next visit. May need to go tonight..."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Liberty Market this past weekend. I am now HOOKED!  

A nice older gentleman greeted us at the line and gave us the run down on what to expect.  

They get your tastbuds going with having to pass by a gigantic glass counter filled with yummy looking treats-cinnamon buns the size of my 3 year olds head, red velvet cake (my fav), sticky buns, gigantic cupcakes etc.  

I had the Italian Scramble and YUMMMMOOOO!  The Schrieners Italian sausage was so delish and the potatoes smothered in cheese-so good.  Its hard to pick my favorite part but the homemade biscuit that I drizzled with honey was to die for.  

I also loved my perfectly mixed carafe of mimosa.
Really can't wait to visit Liberty Market again!"}
{"text":"Don't try ordering online. The order was right, the receipt showed the correct order, but the food in the bag was wrong. Would gives 0 stars if I could because they gave us fish which we don't even eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a relaxing Sunday morning breakfast. My husband ordered by phone went to pick the order up, told them his name and paid. An order was sitting there on the counter for pick up. The staff member asked my husband if he wanted a bag to put the order in and my husband said \"no.\" When my husband got home, we had the wrong order. We were hungry so we just went ahead and ate what we got (like most people) as he didn't want to drive all the way back to the restaurant, find parking and wait for a re-order.  We were eating when we got a nasty call from Liberty Market saying we got the wrong order and it was all our fault.  The person that helped my husband told whoever called us we had just picked up the order and ran. You cannot run without paying the bill. Wrong - not sure why this staff member was not telling the truth! When is it ever right to blame a customer for a restaurant giving you the wrong order. Give me a break!  We have been a loyal customer since Day 1 of this restaurant but we won't be back.  This staff needs massive training on customer service.  Since you ruined our breakfast and we threw most of the breakfast away (since we were very upset), I would like a full refund ($19.00) or I will be going to the Better. Business Bureau to get a re-fund."}
{"text":"Awesome!

I am a high fan of this place. First of all, this place is has more people than an unemployment office when its busy. I have not tried their Pizza but the Pizza looked great as I walked in line. I tried their Ice cream sandwich desert! wow! The fresh chocolate chip cookie along with vanilla ice cream was a huge compliment with my amazing iced Mocha. This place rocks! I can't wait to dine in!"}
{"text":"I'm in love.  And that's all I'm going to say about that.  I find myself dreaming about that latte and staring at the glass cases as if it were some guilty pleasure.  When can I see you again?  It isn't soon enough.  (Psst.  Mind if my husband tags along?)  :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite Sunday morning coffee/roll place! Amazingly good coffee (Mr. Espresso or Stumptown - two of the very best beans available -  depending upon what type of coffee you order). We always have the Cuban cortadito, which is two shot glasses of espresso with sugar in the bottom and a little cream. Stir it up and enjoy one of the best coffee drinks you've ever had - for $4.00. Now, for the food... amazing! Have one of the sweet rolls, which are huge and so good you'll completely forget you promised yourself to take most of it home. Only caution is to get there before church lets out, because it gets very busy fast. Sit at the coffee bar and you can get your coffee quickly and they'll order from the food counter for you."}
{"text":"Great food and large selection of healthy meals. The food is delicious and the service is great. Don't forget a dessert!"}
{"text":"We are always happy to dine here. We brought a group here Sunday morning rush and they accomodated us quickly. Our newbie friends were so happy with the food and the service. One gal in the group had ordered what she thought what a black coffee but it was small, like an espresso shot. The employee, Patrick, explained to her what it was and she decided to try it. He promptly brought her over a mug and showed her where she could get a hot coffee when she wanted it."}
{"text":"love it here. the vegetarian egg scramble is super yummy. baked goods are also delicious! love the atmosphere and i'm sure i will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The coffee bar makes this a regular meeting spot for plenty of town folk.....add in a pastry and Liberty Market becomes a must do for townies and visitors alike!"}
{"text":"I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) 
I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. 
I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day.
That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went early for breakfast, not sure if I wanted to spend $10+, but glad I did! Got the best Denver omelet I've ever had! Went back again a month or so later same thing, awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite time to go to Liberty Market is for brunch. I am a huge fan of their vegan tofu breakfast burrito. It is huge and I love the southwest flavor. Their cofee is great too."}
{"text":"Met friends here for lunch and loved it. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was wonderful. I had a chicken salad sandwich and the roast sweet potato salad. Mmmm! Highly recommended.

After thinking about it, I upped this to five stars. There was nothing to improve upon but the crowd, but that's not really a bad thing. :)"}
{"text":"Looking at the menu and the prices, I didn't want to like this place. I'll be honest some things were a tad bit too much for my wallet's taste but what can I say, I am a foodie and good food always wins me over. Like their white pizza and macarons. Both to die for.

I kept putting this place off because it is pricier and in downtown Gilbert, and I have this fear that everything there will be overrated because that's how I view 99% of the restaurants out in places like Scottsdale, but on your birthday you get a $10 credit so I figured why not? 

My boyfriend raves about the white pizza and wanted to also show me the Salt River Bar (aka saltines covered in caramel covered in a chocolate peanut butter frosting), while I picked out a pistachio and vanilla macaron. When they arrived, I was pretty impressed. While I do think $3 is a bit much for a tiny cookie, and $5 for the Salt River Bar which I could make a batch of for the same price at home, the place has class and the food can come close to matching the higher charges. Especially the white pizza mentioned above. The flavors on that are perfect and I can't think of one thing wrong. 

Now, would I come back? Sure. Will I be a regular? No. I love the modern farmhouse vibe and I also follow them on Instagram for food ideas as they have a rotating seasonal menu that tends to catch my eye, although I still have a hard time justifying coming back all the time. It's a  taste buds versus wallet battle, and right now, wallet is winning. 

But by all means, if you have yet to come here, please do! It's still got great food, I'm just poor(-er than usual, thanks bills)."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! Excellent food and service. I had the American breakfast and it was 'everything'. So good! I live in Scottsdale, but will definitely be making the drive to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed how Liberty Market makes most, if not all, their food from scratch. That includes the pumpkin spice flavoring for their harvest spice latte. Today I ordered my latte with whipped cream and the whipped cream was made in house as well.  I find myself driving the extra 6 miles just to order my drinks from here."}
{"text":"Forgive me Joe for i have sinned . i visited your little restaurant a month ago for breakfast and never reviewed it..Yikes!!  Well here is the scoop I really enjoy the food, ambiance and downright hipness of Liberty .Can I can you Liberty?   The breakfast was super tasty and now I have eaten dinner here as well.  Hubby and I ventured out to Gilbert on our way to Pinetop ..yeah it's on the way. 

We split two entrees . Plus one had the Apricot Chicken, yummy  and generous with a grilled /slight char and a tasty apricot glaze that didn't scream sweet. The veggie with it was asparagus also grilled and a interesting sweet potato mash with a savory taste that I ignored because I kept loving the stuff on my plate.   For me I had a flat iron steak with a Chimchurri sauce that made me smile. I also had a garlic mash potato   which you cant go wrong with  and tasty grilled carrots . 

We also had the red velvet cake which had a smooth texture and a light cream cheese frosting that really made it. 

As always the service was friendly and prompt and made me want to come back.  

Love the decor so updated modern farmy , how do they do that? I also love the unisex  bathrooms with recipes on the walls, yes I took pics hope the recipes turn out!"}
{"text":"In pursuit of a high-quality, healthy dinner spot during a recent business trip, Liberty Market was recommended by a friend. It did not disappoint!  The restaurant has wonderful ambiance, great food, a decent wine list, and they were very accommodating when it came to specific dietary needs.  I had a mixed green salad and the market fish, which was sea bass.  The fish was beautifully cooked, and the salad, though basic, was fresh and delicious.  My friend had the the Far East salad, and she was also quite pleased.  The menu is simple, but the execution is fantastic.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast restaurant I've eaten at in the Phoenix area, comparable to the breakfasts I'm used to from the Pacific Northwest. The food is fresh and delicious, and the menu options are unique (but not too unique). It doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here at this great revitalized old building. The food is good.

BUT I'm disappointed with the seating manager literally arguing with us on wanting a 4 top when there was literally no line & 6 tables available. He made my hubby so mad he won't ever want to come back. 
Way to go \"Seating Manager\". What happen to pleasing the customer. We saw 4 other 4 tops with only 2 people at it.  You should never argue with a customer. The only table for 2 was crammed at the end of a bench, seating far too close to complete strangers.

The food was good as before, although I feel there has been serious biscuit  shrinkage. The vegetable egg scramble is delicious and the cinnamon roll was fab!


Clearly a long line next door, maybe they had similar issue and don't care to take one of the many empty tables."}
{"text":"Liberty Market has slowly risen to be my go-to \"fancy\" eatery in the Valley. The food is fantastic and the price is just low enough that my broke college ass can afford to go there from time to time. This is usually a breakfast place for us but that's mostly due to our schedules. I for one love their weekend dinner specials because... they're almost always fantastic. 

Other positives: 
-Dog friendly. You cannot bring your pup inside with you to order but you can certainly sit outside and nosh with pup in tow. 
-Bread pudding. It's always good but most of the time it's fantastic. Fresh whipped cream and cinnamon rolls that have found a new life as custard.

Negatives:
-Somewhat limited menu. This doesn't really count against them because I'd rather eat at a place that serves 3 things well (See: In-N-Out) than a place that serves a thousand things poorly (See: Denny's)"}
{"text":"I found one of my favorites wines eating here.  The New Age is a white blend from Argentina and it is very easy to drink.

I especially like the steak here, and yes...I will pair it with my fruity white wine."}
{"text":"Great place! I love to do business meetings here. Delicious coffee, rich food, and hipster service. It has a really nice vibe."}
{"text":"Liberty Market has amazing breakfast and lunch. We love the Farmer Pressed sandwich it is an incredible sandwich made with veggies. Everything I order here tastes very fresh. They also have good coffee!"}
{"text":"Very nice little \"market.\"  The son and I had breakfast there this morning.

He had the \"American\" breakfast with 3 scram eggs, \"Liberty\" potatoes, and the split meatball.  I had the biscuits and gravy, and we shared a side of bacon.  I had a Cortadito Cuban micro latte, although I'm not a coffee drinker - just wanted to see what the fuss was about.  It did not convert me, sadly.

Very decent breakfast and the price was in line with other places in town where the breakfast is above average (MBB, LGO, OE).

We liked the layout, and yes the unisex bathroom setup is totally hip (not in the modern interpretation of \"hip\" meaning douchey, but in the traditional definition of hip meaning pretty darn cool.)

Going back with both kids someday and see if we can try a few more things.  I wanted to try the Chorizo quesadilla and will do that next time.

On the list of \"Top Notch Phoenix-Area Breakfast Joints\" for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! The white pizza is amazing and definitely my favorite. Great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Liberty Market. In case you've never been here, you stand in line, order your food and then as you get close to ordering they assign you an open spot. The wait was pretty long, but the food was incredible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs on top, which did not disappoint. My friends were very happy with their meals too. I gave it 4 starts because I felt like they don't have a lot of seating which can make it difficult."}
{"text":"Very happy they had my favorite beef wellington and paired with a great glass of wine. My mother in law thought the cuban sandwich was the best sandwich she has ever had. My husband had the hot brown and it was authentic and very good. This place has a great energy and the owner even stopped by to talk to us and see how everything was."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of downtown Gilbert 
The food is always awesome no matter what you order you won't be disappointed
They have remodeled recently and that has added more needed seating
Breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert all 5 big stars!
Also they spend a lot of time and money on their water quality which makes a huge difference for great tasting drinks"}
{"text":"So I've had classmates rave about this place for the last four years. I ate here once for lunch a couple years ago and it was good, but nothing astounding that made me want to come back. Then we were invited out to dinner here by our friends the other night. Again my food was, good..and some of it was just okay. 

The atmosphere I get why everyone likes it, what a neat place and in a great location. Fantastic for large parties, families, and rowdy get togethers. The service is also great and everyone there seems very friendly. 

Price I think is okay, I didn't mind paying 40.00 for a salad, a sandwich and two desserts, but I would have liked them to have been awesome and they unfortunately weren't'. 

I had a cup of the white bean soup which I found to be pretty bland and unexciting. I had to try and finish it all. The picnic salad is my favorite thing I've had here. I had it the first time for lunch and I had it again for dinner. A good solid salad and a good portion for 9 bucks. My boyfriend had the prime rib sandwich that the cashier told him was one of their sandwiches that sells out the quickest. Neither of us were really impressed with it, seemed like a regular french dip and the sweet potato salad side was not very good, he left most of it. 
We ordered our friends the bread pudding which we all liked, and we had the red velvet cake which was dry and unexciting. Our friends also ordered the starter pizza with hummus which was pretty yummy but a little expensive for a bread based appetizer. I don't remember what they ordered and we didn't try their entrees but they seemed happy with them.

So, maybe we ordered the wrong things, the couple we were with love this place and also said breakfast here is awesome. But our experience was meh..."}
{"text":"Came in for glass of wine and dessert - does not disappoint.  The carrot cake is perfect for sharing - gorgeous edible glowers and dried fruit on top.  Paired with a glass of Pinot Project or a coffee you just cant go wrong.  Their macaroons are amazing.  Picked up a box of 4 for my Mom."}
{"text":"Have I mentioned that I love breakfast.  So you'd know too that I am VERY judge mental of breakfast.  Turns out, this place is pretty good.

A unique style to order with a unique menu, Liberty Market was totally worth the stop after a long night out the night before.  The Blueberry Pancakes were amazing (could have been a little less burnt, but I was DTF with them anyway).  Eggs, perfect.  Cin Roll, you need one and 4 people could eat it.

There are port holes in the unisex bathrooms, but as you shut the door, music turns on so you can't hear the person next to you going...something I appreciated.  This Dog friendly breakfast/lunch joint will get my business next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market!

Their coffee is great (try the Ca Phe). The food is good. They seat people in line through a host so you don't have to worry about seating. The line usually moves pretty quickly too."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Just be ready for a line and please don't complain.  It will be worth the wait, I promise!"}
{"text":"Great fresh salads and fresh new flavors for their slice of the day.  Perfect for lunch inside or outside on the nice shaded patio.  Plus I love it when you tell your server you're splitting something and they do the work for you and bring it on two plates."}
{"text":"I love Liberty Market.  Great food! Tasty desserts."}
{"text":"Had my first and last dining experience at Liberty Market.

I agree with another comment I read below, cafeteria-style service should include cafeteria-style prices.  The food was just ok and I did not appreciate paying lots of cash for what I had for lunch.  (A very small salad with thinly sliced deli turkey on top)

I also see lots of comments about their \"awesome\" bathroom.  Really?  Who cares about the bathroom?

Suggestion:  Go to Joe's BBQ directly across the street or if it's breakfast you are in downtown Gilbert for, go next door to The Farmhouse!  Hands Down!!! Blows Liberty Market away."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Stopped in for Sunday breakfast as the wait at Snooze was 1/2 hour. Food had great flavor but it was lukewarm at best. Should have waited for Snooze and won't be retuning to Liberty any time soon."}
{"text":"Think of it as a shabby chic version of La Grande Orange. It fits the refurbished downtown historic Gilbert like a glove. It took a little while to hit all the right notes but it has really caught a great stride."}
{"text":"First off the ambiance and staff really help make this place top notch. When you are ready you place the order and then are seated if it is busy they give you an number and assign you a table it is very convenient so there is no confusion on where to sit. I have eaten here a few times and have ordered breakfast, lunch and dinner at one time or another they have never let me down. They always have amazing weekend specials that are well thought out and executed by the chef.  If you like coffee or love coffee like me you have to visit the coffee bar for anyone of the drinks. We will definitely  be going back on a more regularly basis. Oh and I cant believe I almost forgot to bring up the sweets and pastries they are the best I have ever had and once again the pastry chef has specials that are out of this world..."}
{"text":"Fresh, Light, delicious meals at a decent price

I have been here for several events - b-day parties, Sunday brunch, girls night, date night, etc.. and it fits any occasion. During the day, it's nice to get some AZ sun on their patio. At night, the candles and ambiance is inviting. Also, their service is FANTASTIC, they are truly concerned with making your experience a good one. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I adore the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The pasta caprice is tasty and is my fall back when there is no tomato soup. Plenty of temptation in the dessert choices, the ice cream sandwich is good for sharing."}
{"text":"Wow it really took me this long to actually try Liberty Market, really!?!?!? What was I thinking! I have been missing out on this place for way too long. And to find it now, just when my company is moving and it was sooo close!!!!

Ok, sorry enough of my whining! This place is just WOW! The food looked amazing; the dessert looked way too good! And the taste did not disappoint either.

My friend and I went to lunch today at Liberty Market, I was at first surprised by the line to order, it was LONG! But the way they seat people is really ingenious; by the time you are done ordering you have a table waiting. Pretty cool!

We ordered the Picnic Sandwich, which was very flavorful. My favorite part was the crisp green apples, which added great texture. A little blue cheese, some turkey, it was really well put together.

We also ordered the White pizza, which was very tasty! The crust was nice and crispy and the pine nuts were an excellent addition. Oh and don't forget dessert, no I really mean it, DON'T forget dessert....well I guess you can if you are on a diet or something. We had the Red Velvet Cake, YUM!

I think Liberty Market really has taken the cafeteria style dining and made it a well-organized machine; I am so impressed by this place. What took me so long to get here, I ask myself again!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to dine. The food is fresh and the menu varied. Placed two orders today;  the salmon BLT & the pizza of the day. The salmon was cooked perfectly and came with a side of cold sweet potato salad, both delicious. The pizza was incredible!  Today's pie was a brie, apple, sausage combination with a hint of honey for its \"sauce\". This pizza is a MUST have. No desserts today,  saving that for my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm a big Liberty Market fan and a big Joe Johnston fan as well.  Both this place and Joe's BBQ rock but lets focus on Liberty Market.  

Liberty market has one of the greatest atmospheres.  You just always feel at home in this place even when its your first time coming here. The food has always been good, I have tried quite a few dishes here and have always been very happy.  My favorite dish though is the burger.  Get it with some blue cheese and use all of their wonderful burger sauce that you get with the plate and just enjoy.  

One thing I MUST mention about Liberty market is the Cortadito.  I know most people have no idea what a Cortadito is.  Well its a cuban style espresso shot which is sweetened with sugar as it is being brewed with a little foamed cream on top.  Or you could also just call it coffee heaven.  if you like coffe at all you MUST get this and try it.  I tend to have two bowls of Cortadito lately every time i go there.  I just cant get enough of it 

So long story short is; get your butt to liberty market right now. Don't ask questions just go.  If I didn't live 35 miles from this place I would be there probably every day.  Its just one of those places you want to hang out at and relax."}
{"text":"Love this place.  From the food to the atmosphere, we enjoy every time we go."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been raving about this place for a while now, and with good reason! I was finally able to go here for breakfast over the weekend. While my friends raved about their twist on french toast, I have to admit that wasn't my favorite... I did, however, LOVE their blueberry pancakes! One would think you can get pancakes anywhere, but these were seriously amazing!

While the food was super tasty and worth the higher prices, the way in which to order food seemed to contradict both a little. Overall, super tasty and definitely worth going back to! :)"}
{"text":"In a word. Yes!  Great food, service, atmosphere and location. Beet salad and any pizza and you are good to go...unless you want dessert, then try the carrot cake which is unlike anything you have ever had before. Can get busy but we have never really had to wait. Good wine list."}
{"text":"I've been to the Liberty Market several times and they never disappoint.  The men in my family always go for the wood fired pizzas (which are superb).. but for those who want a healthier option--their salads make for filling and guilt-free eating.  

The place is always moderately busy, but never so packed that you can't get prompt service.  Plus, there is plenty of inside and outdoor/patio area to park your plates.  Even the bathrooms are well kept and clean.  This place has become a family staple.

Fair Warning:  The red velvet cake will make you an addict."}
{"text":"Not exactly what we were expected.  Odd thing is I don't really know what we were expecting. We follow their social media account and it touts some very impressive dishes but as we approached the counter service style nothing really jumped out as extraordinary. The food we did get was good and had some flavor but it was the general experience that felt lacking. There was a small lack of engagement from the team working there. Really only one person engages with you and it's purely transactional.  The delicious items posted regularly are not really anywhere to be seen and the case holding some baked goods has a weird lighting and doesn't do the snacks justice. So we sat on the patio, snacked and left.   Maybe next time. I love to figure these quandaries out."}
{"text":"i love liberty market.

i do not love lines but i will gladly stand in one for one of their fantastic desserts.  they have an amazing red velvet cake & cheesecake in a jar.  YUMM.  quality.  

the decor is modern.  the kind of restaurant that you wish your house looked like if you were a little hipster baby.  does that make sense?  four stars because it can get super packed & the wait takes soo long.  or it feels like a long time.  sometimes it's discouraging enough to give up all together & seek refuge at postinos or dare i say it... oreganos.

still.  i love this little spot & i definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"So we went to Liberty Market about two weeks ago. Prior to going to Liberty Market my wife wanted to get Sushi and we walked to the sushi place in Gilbert and waited for 20 minutes to never even be asked if we would like drinks. We walked out and I suggested Liberty grill! We walked in and there was an issue with their computers but we were reassured that we would be taken care of. We ordered and the food was great and the service was amazing. When we asked about paying we were told they were taking care of the meal due to the issues with the computer. What a classy move. This is the type of business the community should continue and. Always support! Thank you Liberty Market!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a large group of my family. We have never been treated so terribly by staff at a restaurant. Long story short we ended up putting down our menus and walking out, all 10 of us and going across the street to SoCal(which I highly recommend). We are always in downtown Gilbert but will completely avoid Liberty and will make sure all of our family/friends do as well."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good venue in Gilbert.   I didn't think Gilbert could produce this sort of place :).  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the outdoor patio.  Service was awesome.  We were able to order immediately and the food came out pretty fast.   Food was great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My wife and I are snobs. When we go out, we expect great things. We like simple things, but we like them as perfect as God intended them. 

Liberty Market simply has the best comfort foods known to man. Chef Traina is a good man with a talent for doing great things with common man ingredients. 

Pizza, burgers, salads, deserts, breakfasts, everything is an experience, and a great one at that. 

Our core orders are:
Sausage Pizza, hold onion add roasted red peppers
Grilled Chicken Pasta (AKA chicken Alfredo)
Hollywood Cobb Salad
Demi breakfast with the bacon pancake and a well done turkey maple sausage
Capresse Sandwich, grilled in oven, best when tomatoes are from Agritopia
Minestrone Soup
Far East Salad
The burger

Now there is a subculture at Liberty Market that is worth noting

The E-61 bar is a separate, but conjoined experience and the Baristas are able to create outstanding beverages that are like nothing I have found in AZ. You can not go wrong with anything from the E-61 bar. My suggestions are:

Iced Latte
Double Cortadito
Irish Latte
Caffe Mocha

Each is special in one way and are all profound experiences. 

I have overlooked many details in this review. Not because they are forgotten, but because they are irrelevant. Quite simply Liberty Market is unpretentious, inviting and special. You will have a great experience here and you will return over and over again. 

If you are planning on going to Liberty Market, GO!"}
{"text":"I kind of like the place overall but certain things just bug me.  We've been here a few times without our dogs and wait in the line, get the table, and wait.  The no waiter service thing sucks but it is what it is.  Ask for over medium eggs and only can get scrambled eggs because they prefer to serve a vat of scrambled eggs.  Ask to get something like fruit or whatever instead of the potatoes but you can't do that either.  We walk by with our dogs and the girls that work at Liberty tell us to bring our dogs on the patio, while I'm standing out front and waiting for a coffee to go.  We went today to the empty side patio and sat down while one of us ordered inside.  A guy in a red shirt and black hair comes out and tells us that this might not be our table and that we should basically stand in the middle of the sidewalk and wait, 5 people and 2 dogs.  Really, nobody is even out here.  If 5 tables worth of people show and your packed inside then we'll move.  So we kept sitting and waited for our food, a girl came out, offered water, we told her what we were doing and what the guy said, and she said not to worry about it.  So yes we ate - pudding bread, blueberry pancakes, eggs and bacon, biscuits and gravy, coffee drinks,and a mimosa.  The food was pretty good not great, which I feel is typical here.  The biscuits are very good and I've always liked their coffee.  I think other than grabbing a coffee we will steer clear of this place.  Farmhouse has better food, Bergie's has very good coffee, and BLD has good food and a great dog friendly patio.  That's plenty of options really."}
{"text":"True to form, it's been two years since I reviewed this place!  I swear I don't do that on purpose.

Well, what can I say that I haven't said already?  They are much the same as always.  Some interesting dishes ranging from the \"tower burger\" to pizzas (done in a brick oven) to sandwiches (Cuban, meatball, and more) to pasta to soups, and some other things.  This time I had the \"Hot Brown\".  I think this is new as I don't ever remember seeing it before.  I've tried most of the items on their menu over the years.  My wife had the minestrone.

The minestrone was excellent.  Really good.  The Hot Brown is \"Texas toast\" with sliced turkey on it and covered with tomatoes and mozzarella and probably some other stuff.  Had a definite Italian flare to it, and was pretty good.

So we remain fans, and reiterate 4-stars.  They do have chef's specials, but mostly that's the only variation you will see here.  The menu seldom changes, and after a while you've probably tried it all.  The flavors are good, but they don't usually \"wow\".  So I can't really go to 5 stars."}
{"text":"There are a few mixed feelings in is post but I'm picky and I know it. I also know this is a great place and I would recommend it to everyone looking for a wholesome, healthy meal, or options for dessert and coffee.

Atmosphere: very open. They aren't trying to hide anything. All of the cooking stations are viewable and the full kitchen is behind glass windows. The bathrooms are co-ed sort of. You just share sinks. I loved how they were decorated with recipes.

Menu: it's brief, but for a good reason. They have seasonal/rotating menus in addition to the set menu. 

Coffee Bar: the barista is great. My macchiato was perfect. Traditional with no frills. Don't come expecting frappaccinos or gigantic serving sizes.

Food: the chopped salad looked great on paper, but I wasn't thrilled. The kale was raw and unmassaged. I understand that's a petty review but it was just hard to swallow with it being so raw and dry. The apricots were nothing more special than what you can get in the bulk section. The seed brittle was delicious but kind of weird to have on the salad and hard to eat with a fork. The market fish special was delicious and perfectly cooked, but didn't come with any thing green. I ordered a side of the day and it was a tiny serving for $6. My grandmother got the mac and cheese and said it was soooooo delicious! 

Service: everyone was great, friendly. Asked how my day was. Answered all questions. Offered to change it add anything. Kept water coming."}
{"text":"Love everything about Liberty Market!  Great people great food and great downtown Gilbert location. Since it opened, I have not had one disappointing meal. Fun place to bring friends"}
{"text":"I love this place, great menu and food.  Only thing holding it back is lack of more beer choices and long lines."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to see a few of the local restaurants that just moved into town lately this past week and came across Liberty Market. The outside looks unappealing so we weren't too sure about it but the moment we stepped inside we saw it was a really cool little place. The inside takes you back to the early days of the restaurant (in some ways). The feel of the place was modern/older and the line felt like something straight from high school. In the same line you walk by all the savory deserts and salads one could get with your meal. 

We ordered up and it came to $30 for two meals and a appetizer. Not too bad but that is where it started to go down hill. First, they ask where you would like to be seated (let me rephrase that) they asked how many were in our party and that we should look for a # that matched the one he gave me. Second, It took literally forever to get our meals. It even took a solid 10-15 min to get out appetizer out to us (they were cut fries, shouldn't take too long). When we were at the register we asked how big the fries were and she said a good portion. When we got them there were 10 fries. Suggestion, get the habanero sauce and not the curry ketchup. The curry ketchup sauce was not to our liking. 

Once the food came (30 min later) and pretty darn tootin good. I just don't think we'll ever get an appetizer again. Wasn't really worth the extra $6 and tax. I would value the fries at $3. The atmosphere is pretty fun and quaint. Unless you like large crowds I wouldn't suggest going on a weekend. 

Overall the food was good but we were probably expecting a little more bang for our buck. We'll definitely go back and suggest friends to go but would advise to spend a little extra for not a whole lot. Good ingredients and good food."}
{"text":"The amount of items on the menu is fantastic! The food is to die for. There are many gluten free items to pick from but my favorite is their chicken sandwich. I love the buns they serve it on. Seriously. There aren't many places that serve delicious gluten free bread. It doesn't taste gluten free at all. Everything looks and tastes so fresh. Love the decor! It can get really busy but the system they have in place to seat people works wonderfully. Service is great, food is great....the whole place is great!"}
{"text":"Was surprised by this restaurant mainly due to its Diner look from the outside but by the reco of most yelpers had to try it out. First of all the inside is definitely very modern and fun to look at. My wife and I came here for dinner and the food was very tasty. She had their Hamburger of the week which had a japanese fusion which she enjoyed very much. I had the Chicken sandwich and this was amazing the moment it hit my mouth. I know live very close to this restaurant and vow to come quite often and try everything on the menu.

Only reason it did not get 5 stars was because the elbow room is not very good here, tables are RIGHT next to each other. I understand you have to pack in as much as you can but it was difficult having a conversation wondering if the people next to you who are in the middle of chewing are listening in. Other than that great place."}
{"text":"Since moving to Gilbert in September, we have been to Liberty Market several times! Although the line may look long majority of the time, it's worth the wait and moves super fast due to their seating system. The food is out almost always 5 min after sitting down at our assigned table. Great place to grab breakfast after the Farmers Market on Saturday's!"}
{"text":"Excellent, from when we walked in and were greeted until we lift satisfied.

First time here, did not know what to expect.  Greeted as soon as we walked in, grabbed a menu and started looking to see if it was something we liked.  A little on the pricy side for lunch but well worth it.  As we looked at the menu, the manager (we assumed) a bubbly woman, very happy with her job, let us look at the SALMON BLT that was going out to a table.  My wife made her choice as soon as she saw that.  I got the pasta and meatballs.

Service was quick and tasty.  It was $42 for 2 for lunch....but YUMMY!

Will be here again!"}
{"text":"I tried the white pizza and picnic sandwich.  The pizza was the best white pizza I've had anywhere, and the sandwich was very fresh.  I look forward to trying breakfast here."}
{"text":"Wow.  The pizza here at night is absolutely fantastic.  I know I've had pizza here once before but it was during the day and seemed similar to the pizza on their menu over at Joe's Farm, but the dinner menu pizza was absolutely delicious.  I had the house special of the night, the Quattro Formaggio and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal.. this place is completely off the charts fantastic..

The wife and decided to go there after we got back from the east coast on Christmas Day..

We have been going here for several years  and I truly  need to give it 5 stars.. 
the atmosphere is hands down cooler than hell.. in an old corner market.. the food is off the hook.. with the salads, hand stretched pizzas and everything breakfast my personal favorites.. with the minestrone; with sausage being out of this world good.

Do yourself favor and all of your friends and family.. go to liberty market and no matter what you get.. you will love it."}
{"text":"Their Cuban sandwich is delicious. We also got their spicy potato appetizer which was a little too much--a little salty and sour. We got a few other things which were all good. The wine I got had gone bad (it's ok it happens) and the server was very apologetic and got me a new drink asap. Loved the casual atmosphere but their tables are just a little too close together. Nonetheless if i fits i sits. Will for sure be grabbing regular lunches here."}
{"text":"Good food, but avoid the place during any busy hours.  %70 of the tables are empty but their line process is so inefficient that you stand for an hour before you get to order. 

Updated:
Ownership responded and have said they have corrected the issue. Once verified I will update this review"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at Liberty for some time now and finally on Friday we had dinner there.  And oh my gosh the food was so good. I shared the steak sandwich and after my first bite I realized what a mistake I made by sharing it. I really wished I one have had it all to myself. But because I shared the sandwich I was able to eat the blueberry cheesecake and once again I was not disappointed. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was just okay.  Maybe I had high expectations since I'd been told good things and read that the food was awesome.  I had the Farmer's sandwich with side of hummus.  This is a veggie sandwich, and full of veggies I love, but it lacked any real flavor.  I thought maybe because I didn't get the goat cheese, I had taken away from the sandwich's deliciousness, but my friend had the same sandwich WITH the goat cheese, and she didn't much enjoy her sandwich either.  I was glad to have a side of hummus, because I was able to use it to make the sandwich have some taste.  The hummus was good, not the best I've had, not the worst.  I also ordered a macaron since I had been staring at them in the case for a few minutes... Taste was okay, but the form wasn't great as the macaron was basically hollow.  =/   I've been working on my own macarons at home, so I know hollow is bad.  Sucks paying almost $4 for a hollow cookie.  This wouldn't be my go-to for downtown Gilbert since there are so many other options, and I've had better food everywhere else nearby.  The other bakery items looked tasty, but I'm not sure I'd go back just for that."}
{"text":"We found this place while walking to The Farmhouse for breakfast and decided to try it. It was really good. We both liked the food, the service and the atmosphere. Much better than The Farmhouse! Will definitely come back another time :)"}
{"text":"Paid $11 for the worst Caesar salad I've ever had. Cold chicken is fine, but when it's tough and extremely dry, $11? Really? Not to mention, the size is something I would consider to be an appetizer or side salad. I asked the women at the register if it was a big salad and she pointed to two salads saying \"that's 1 split\" and I got that same size. Also not a fan of sitting next to strangers a foot from each side away from you, sitting in their conversations, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Always great food, fun and atmosphere. Eclectic original dishes. Eaten here hundreds of times. Consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and it's great.  Get in line, they will give you a number while you're waiting that corresponds to the number in your table.  Pancakes are great and the burritos are to die for."}
{"text":"So if I could give another 1/2 star I would!  (If we need to bus our table it's auto deduct for me, it doesn't make me upset at all, I mean typically because they have been or are really busy and I've been there so it's ok!) Anyway, super friendly throughout.  Several associates spotted us \"newbies\" and asked if we had questions etc  So you order at the counter first then get a seat.  The nice thing is a gal came up to us in line and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside in the shade and she gave us a table number & went and put our table number on the table for us...menu has TONS of delicious options...PLUS all the delicious bakery items..

We were here for breakfast and ask one of the associates what the favorites are...chilequilles he said has become so popular it's on breakfast, lunch and dinner menus...so the Mr ordered that and I was thrilled at their menu guide...Gluten free or gluten free with modification or even Vegan....nice to cover all the bases!  I ordered the Geilled Vegetable Scramble tender scrambled eggs (lotsa good stuff, kale, red pepper, mushrooms, grilled zucchini) with a side of bacon.  Mr kept saying..mmm I'm going to order this again! Biscuits were tender & buttery...he ordered a side of Biscuits and Gravy....HUGE chunks of sausage and creamy gravy.  There were countless other things wanting to try!

We were seriously impressed how fast and hot our food came out.  

We sat on the dog friendly patio and enjoyed the light breeze...will be back to enjoy this lovely place!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed by all the hype. Food was only so-so. I had a French dip beef sandwich, and it was absolutely tasteless, even with the dip and horseradish sauce. The same goes for the cold side salad of the day, a cucumber/tomato mix. The place was crowded so everyone else must love it; I would have to think twice before returning."}
{"text":"For breakfast, pass on this overpriced and trendy ingredients place and go right around the corner to the Farmhouse Restaurant. We have eaten at both and the Farmhouse is a more traditional style meal that l appreciate. 
Back at Liberty, of the three breakfast meals at our table, one was sent back,ingredients in food not listed on menu. Two meals had breakfast meats that were inedible. Sweet cured bacon too sweet to eat and a smashed \"meatball\" that they serve in place of breakfast sausage,terrible! Oh yeah,did I mention you get to stand in line to order? Just like at a fast food place except you'll spend $10 a plate. Great! No,bad."}
{"text":"I love LM in so many ways and on this visit I found one more thing to go absolutely mad for, the Sticky Bun. As I stood in line to order my dinner I heard something call out.. \"eat me\".. as I looked over into the baked goods display I heard it again.. \"eat me\".. as I cocked my head I leaned in and asked \"are you talking to me?\" I only heard silence but knew what was calling to me, it was the Sticky Bun. It was truly a sight to see, beckoning with its deep cinnamon brown color, adorned with glistening candied pecans and thick chewy glaze, I couldn't turn my head but to order with a finger point.. \"Ill have that with a side of ice cream\".. I felt as if I was in some sort of trance.. I cant look away! 

When my Sticky Bun was delivered to my table I couldn't help but stare into the caramel covered abyss. I wondered if I could get the whole thing into my mouth at once? What was I thinking? That would be complete and udder madness!! Let's be calm and rational about this. A gorgeous Sticky Bun calls to me from a pastry case and asks me to eat it. I'm simply fulfilling a last wish and request and boy did I, the Sticky Bun was absolutely delicious.

{"text":"Super Friendly Staff, Good Food, $6 coffee....

The staff greets warmly and assists you with samples. 

The atmosphere is cool, good ambiance and proper level of music in the background. 

The Sweet Potatoes were really good. Fresh flavor added by some vinaigrette and other ingredients. 

The Salmon BLT was tasty... I felt like it would have been cooler with something other than a hamburger style bun... for a $13 sandwich maybe some bruschetta or more imaginative bred would have been better. 

Parking is tricky as Old Town Gilbert has gone crazy in the last couple years with explosions of people and new businesses everywhere with little thought to parking to compensate....

Somehow my sandwich and coffee ended up ringing in at $24 pre tip which seemed like a high priced brunch... I would have gone higher on the rating possibly otherwise"}
{"text":"Burnt food.  Long wait. Flies everywhere. 

This is the worst dining I've had in a long time. I cant believe how expensive this place is!"}
{"text":"This was first time here, so when I walked in there was someone at the bar. See employees around but no one acknowledged me. I stood there for a couple minutes, saw menu and began raid g it, and then the bartender walked past me saying we will be with you. So I stood there for a minute then went to look at food displays and sat at window seats waiting for my friend. When she arrived we went back to front entrance and looked at specials posted and grabbed menu...the bartender described the trout and that 2 nice pieces were given for $30. So I decided to treat myself to the trout. When I ordered it at the cashier and asked what else comes with the trout he said nothing just the fish, so trying to stay low carb I ordered a half Caesar salad. He asked if I wanted it all together and I said that was fine. To my pleasant surprise the trout was accompanied-with fresh green beans and black rice. I began to eat my salad which was very good and a good size portion. An employee asked how everything was. I said I was still working on my salad will try fish soon. She said try it b4 it gets cold and she will be back to check. The trout was very good the lemon butter sauce was very light and tasty. As I thought about it I wouldn't have ordered a salad if I knew that side dishes were included. So I mentioned to a staff member walking by when he asked how everything was that the cashier should be aware that the fish does include sides. He thanked me for letting him know so I hope the message was relayed. Even though there is not an actual wait service the staff would walk by with smiles and ask how everything is and removing empty plates was nice. I will be back to try the eggplant Parmesan. I really enjoy the atmosphere, the grocery carts decor, coed bathroom stalls with community sinks, being able to see the chef cooking in back and there's a nice outdoor patio on our way out the back door. Yes I will be back!"}
{"text":"The apricot glazed chicken and veggies with whipped sweet potatoes are unbelievable. I always say I'm going to try something different, but I just can't! Completely wonderful simple bold flavors and the texture of the potatoes is perfect. In fact, I need some now."}
{"text":"I would wake up early everyday just to eat here for breakfast! 

Lines were long on a Sunday morning around 930am but it moved. You order your food first and they seat you. I wanted a simple breakfast so I ordered the Demi Breakfast which came with 2 scrambled eggs, choice of pancake or biscuit and sausage or bacon. I chose the blueberry pancakes and sausage. The sausage was heavenly and blueberry pancakes were fluffy ! The fresh blueberries were delightful! Scrambled eggs here are amazing, they were fluffy yet firm and seasoned perfectly! You could tell these eggs were fresh! 

Overall I enjoyed my breakfast here and I'm craving breakfast just thinking about it!! Mmmm! 

On a side note: their bathrooms are unisex. The stalls have interesting designs - mine was filled with recipes lol!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've found on the Gilbert strip, and probably the best cappuccino as well.  

This place has a really interesting concept and personality.  It feels like a great coffee shop and a breakfast spot that had a baby.  The ambiance is laid back and aesthetically pleasing, the staff is really friendly and the food is outstanding.  I had the basic breakfast and sat at a high-top for a while to do some work.  

I'll be back, and frequently."}
{"text":"The best in Gilbert! I usually will go here for a good rice pudding fix."}
{"text":"Liberty Market

Margherita pizza and chicken salad sandwich were awesome    
Parking tho is tough.
They are really a busy place. Tables are hard to get as well. Suggestion would be if you see open table put something on it so others know it's taken. 
You stand in line about 20-30 min before you order than get your cups for soda if you want one $2.75 for soda. Ouch!!
They give you a number to put on your table and they bring food to you.  
They have espresso Coffe bar as well. We didn't try it. 
We than ordered an ice cream sandwich as their goodies you look at standing in line looked to yummy to pass up. 
$7 for ice cream sandwich its two chocolate chip cookies and ice cream in between. 
It was so hard you couldn't break it in half to split. 
And it wasn't good food tho made up for it. 
Staff is friendly and owners came in while we were their.  Friendly as well."}
{"text":"I love their pancakes. Phenomenal. Their ice cream sandwiches are also amazing."}
{"text":"This is how it goes each and every time I go to Liberty Market. Note to self: SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT. Honey can I try some of yours..... just a bite..... as I start my way through the white wood fired pizza, oh what did you get? Can I try some? I wish they had a sample platter of EVERYTHING....OK save room.....yummmmm...did I just eat that entire pizza? Yep! Oh I'll take a slice of the red velvet cake......... can you put that to go?........... Honey where's your fork?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the East Valley. One of the catalysts of the crazy Downtown Gilbert food scene, Liberty consistently creates great burger, pizza and finer cuisine specials each week. Sometimes they post a daily creation on Instagram and we go down to try it. 

Standards like the Tower Burger and the Salt River Bar for dessert are not to be missed. The hot chocolate is great and if that's all you want, just go right up the barista at the separate counter. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with the Italian Scramble. 

If the line to order at the counter is long, extending to the main entrance, expect 20 minutes in line to order and another 30-40 minutes to get your food. If you have the time, it's worth it.

I'm glad they keep considering the offering. The addition of fingerling potatoes sliced as fries was a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Dinner was so good I had to try breakfast. Unfortunately our breakfast experience was BAD! We got there at 7:10 am. Sat ourselves, read through the menu, and waited while a 3 member wait staff drank coffee fraternized and completely ignored our presence!  it's no wonder why the place was empty at this time of day."}
{"text":"Crab Po-boy is the best!
The first time we ate here my wife and I got sick from the food. We couldn't figure out why.  The management contacted my wife and wanted us to come talk to him and asked us to please give their food another shot. Well we did!
Since then we have been here about 3 or 4 times and the food has been fantastic.  I love the Crab Po-Boy and pretty much any burger on the menu!  While we were waiting for our food we were enjoying the smells of the foods at the table next to us.
Next time we come in, we will be getting a pizza I think. They looked delicious!
Thank you Liberty Market management for contacting us! We are both so happy we came back for another try at your food... and a third and a fourth!  So good! Well worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been here years ago and was in the neighborhood so I decided to get some breakfast. The food here is splendid and the breakfast is no different. I got the American Standard with a Ca-Phé (Vietnamese Coffee). The Liberty Potatoes were killer, jalapeños and caramelized onions make them so tasty. Also nice thick bacon. I would absolutely recommend the Ca-Phé. Also a great open dining room with friendly and smiling staff. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Best Coffee I have ever had - especially the Cafe Latte!  Clean, open atmosphere.  Always quieter eating outside or at less busy times."}
{"text":"There is always one place I have to visit when I'm in AZ but now there is two. This place rocks! Every dish I saw was amazing and looked seriously yummy. Not one person in our party complained but cleaned their plates and had a happy smile. But the best thing about this place is the service. Dave the chef actually came by twice. Once to see how our food was and another to share his kale salad recipe with me. You have to eat here if you're a foodie. Or just like to eat. Seriously."}
{"text":"This place is great. We went because we are a fan of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill. We were not disappointed with the food or atmosphere.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomatos and the potato salad. The potato salad was the best I have ever had and the grilled cheese was the best I ever had, and I have had MANY versions of both meaning that I have a little bit of a weight problem. But anyways Liberty Market is worth a try and Im sure you will want to go back. It kinda reminds me of a cooler version of La Grande Orange."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here for my birthday last week, since they offer $10 towards the birthday person's meal. It's actually a good deal, since most items range between $10-$15.

I got the pizza of the week, which was a Sriracha pizza. I can honestly say it was one of the best pizzas I've had in a LONG time. The crust was perfect. Cheesy, spicy, covered in pepperoni and bacon, I inhaled the entire pie. If it's ever on the menu again, get it! Seriously. You'll thank me later.

My friends got the chicken pasta, and were practically licking the plates. Another friend got the salmon and orzo, and I'm pretty sure he DID lick the plate. My partner got the BLT, and was raving. Thick pieces of bacon, fresh, crisp veggies, good bread. 

There were some great looking desserts that I'd love to go back and try one of these days. 

I'm definitely planning on a second visit some time soon. There were enough items on the menu that piqued my interest to warrant going back, and I'm a huge fan of good, wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Just plain and simple loved it. Came in this morning to get breakfast, first time I had been here for breakfast. Started off with a Mocha bowl and it was awesome! Might be back again this week and will need to add a shot of Jameson to it. As for breakfast I ordered the Demi-Breakfast: two eggs scrambled, pancake and flattened meatball. All I can say is very tasting the meatball with the eggs was a great flavor combo. Service = awesome. Food = awesome. Atmosphere = awesome. 

Will be back many times. Thank you Joe for having these great places to eat and thank you to your staff for taking care of all the customers the way they do."}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything I didn't like. This place is always a good choice. The downside is all the calories I'm capable of eating. But that's my own fault!"}
{"text":"I can't really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them!

Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.

Oh! As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen. (seriously)"}

{"text":"I am continually pleased at the awesome food and customer service here.
It just keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"This was so yummy! The lack of stars comes from finding a hair in my burger and then a struggle with the waiter/manager to have them remove the item from our bill. They did offer another entree... but at that point I was too full and would have felt wasteful. I told them it wasn't fair for me to pay for something I didn't get to eat. Eventually they removed it from the bill. 

I got the red bean and rice burger and it was SO delicious. Very filling. My husband got the salmon BLT and also loved it. 

It's a cool atmosphere in a cool part of town. 

Again, great food but the management is not very willing to fix their mistakes..: thus the 3 star review."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good! Everyone was really nice and friendly. On your way to the bathrooms, you will be able to see the chefs at work. It's nice that you can see how they are preparing the food. The bathrooms are pretty cool as well! I recommend it. The French toast was delicious!"}
{"text":"Been many times....

Pros:
- Fresh food well portioned and presented.  Today I had Farmers Salad with a side of hummus.  
- Friendly staff
- Price is right 
- IF you get one of the sweets, they are really good!

Cons:
- on the loud side
- seats are hard chairs

Out of the ordinary
- unisex bathrooms.  Shared wash bowls.   


I enjoy Liberty Market very much.  LIKE them on Facebook and you get to see what the specials are; very creative and tasty."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype before going here, and it didn't quite live up to it all.  I have been back several times over the last few years, and I have found you have to be really selective about what you order.  All foods here are not created equally!!  I say give it a try so you can say you have been there, and I will probably go back one day, but more for the ambiance than the food."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. We had a party of 12, ranging from 1 year to 83 years old and every single person was blown away with how great their food was. For me, I ordered the hot Cuban sandwich. They may have forgotten to put the aioli mayo on it because I was expecting more spice, but it was still sooooooo good! My kids had some of the best Mac and cheese ever and my wife had the roasted turkey sandwich. My mom had the crab cakes and absolutely loved them. Oh you want desserts too? They're a whole 'nother story. We had the salt river bar and ice cream sandwich and it was all soooo good. Of course, I don't know that you can go wrong eating anywhere in downtown Gilbert, but Liberty Market has to be up there at the top."}
{"text":"Gosh, I wanted to try this place so bad and had such high expectations! Was a little let down. I get real excited when it comes to breakfast, but Liberty Market just didn't do it for me.

One thing I did like what the atmosphere of this place, it is pretty cool. The service was fine as well. I ordered eggs with fruit and toast and it was okay. Not awesome, not bad. My boyfriend felt the same way about his food as well.

Another thing I liked about this place is that they have all their treats and goodies on display. It is torture, I wanted one of everything. I could not pass up a sweet potato muffin so I went for that. It was excellent! Had a great flavor to it.

I would come back, maybe for a different meal. Definitely for more baked goods, because that was the best part about Liberty Market for me."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!!! Super clean. Cute decor. The bathroom is super nice! Lol. My entire family loves this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. I recommend their lattes, baked goods and burgers. They also have a great beer selection. We go here a lot because we like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped into Liberty on a weekday for lunch. Little did I know, the market is more known for breakfast and brunch! Lunch was not bad though. At $34 for 2 sandwiches, a small side each, and fountain drinks, maybe a little pricey. The quality of food (I had the cuban sandwich) was good. I left a bit hungry still, but certainly felt more healthy than downing tacos or a burger down the strip. There are definitely a lot of healthy options at Liberty. The building itself and vibe inside were very laid back and cool. Nobody rushing back to work in this crowd! Next time I stop in will be to check out the breakfast. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"It's more Liberty than Market.  I was just back from vacation and hoping to buy some ready made food for my empty fridge - my options were beer and cold salads.  So instead, I sat down and had a meal there.  I ordered a salad and my partner in crime had a grilled cheese sandwich, both were tasty.  

Very cool minimalist decor but the tables and soda station were messy in the rush of the lunch hour.  The service was friendly - you go up to the counter, order your food and they bring it out to you, you grab your own drinks - it's not the type of place where you're being waited on.  

The restrooms were unisex and then had an outer area where the boys and girls washed their hands together, I thought that was nice because you don't have to commit to going into a restroom just to wash your hands before your meal.  The sinks don't have a mirror in front of you, it's a window that looks outside - I liked that little detail."}
{"text":"GREAT!!!!! The food was so fresh and yummy. I love how they grow their own food or get it from AZ growers. I went there with some friends and we all order different things and they all rocked. You will not be disappointed.....go.
The staff was great as well, friendly, super nice. This place has a kewl vibe to it and is kept clean. Don't forget the expresso bar are the red velvet cake.
They also help with local charties. This place totally gets 2 thumbs up from me.
The line can be a little long, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Liberty Market. I love the atmosphere but you really have to time it perfectly when you choose to go or you will walk into utter chaos. Avoiding weekends is probably a good idea. I went during the late afternoon on a Saturday and it was busy but not horrible. I ordered the Italia sandwich and unfortunately had to request something else. I'm not sure what was wrong but something just tasted really off. They were super nice and asked me to choose something else. When I got my new selection (the margherita pizza) I was really impressed. It was some of the best pizza I've ever had. Overall I would eat there again, just never on a weekend :)"}
{"text":"Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \"garlic\" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I truly love this place.  Not just because it's awesome food, but Chef David Traina & his wife Kiersten rock.  Ok, pretty much everyone rocks there.  I've been to a few \"community dinners\" there, which are 1st rate - and it's one of those \"Cheers\" type places where they remember your name and are always happy to see you.  I recommend this to ANYONE.  Check it out, not just 'cause I said so but because it rocks."}
{"text":"Very good food. I am always happy when I come here. Menu always has something new to appreciate. I love their bread puddings and carrot cake. Took my husband here for dessert after dinner. I would give them a 5 stars, he gives them 4 stars for lack of drink menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so fun looking at all the options of sweets in the display windows prior to ordering meal.  The design layout/look of this place makes it so cool and memorable!  The restrooms are the unique design feature that will be a topic of discussion for everyone who visits.  Sounds funny, yet the interior design is off the cuff genius!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is always fresh and delicious.  Great atmosphere for a meal with friends, or even business!  

The salads and light dressings are amazing!"}
{"text":"We tried Liberty Market last weekend for the first time and as we had heard--it was great. Worth the drive from North Phoenix! Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, flavorful food. We had to wait in line for a while to be seated, as we arrived at peak dinner hours on Friday night. However, when the hostess asks, say that you're willing to sit at the high top tables and you'll be escorted right to the front of the line to order and sit down. We saved at least thirty minutes by doing this. I ordered the Salmon BLT, and my husband ordered the Hot Cuban Sandwich. Both were very tasty, as was the Brie plate that we ordered (it comes with soft toast, delicious candied pecans, apple slices, and baby greens). 

Our only regret was that we ate so much that we were unable to fit in any dessert (which looked absolutely decadent, from the sight of the giant cake slices, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and heaping ice cream sundaes that we saw going by). We will definitely have to go back and give those a taste!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. Little bit pricey, but worth it. Unique dining experience and friendly staff. 
Went for lunch for the first time. Ordered the picnic sandwich and mac and cheese. Picnic sandwich was a little heavy on the blue cheese for my own personal tastes, but still really tasty. Mac and Cheese was fantastic, just wish it would have been a slightly larger portion. 
Excited to try breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Burger of the week is the green Chiles. It was amazing!  Takes me back to visiting new Mexico where all my family is. Love it!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places for lunch in AZ.  I am always last to order when I go with friends because there is so much that looks good!

Don't be fooled into thinking that Liberty Market is just a ladies lunch place because they have awesome farm-fresh vegetables, salads, and a ton of healthy options.  Any man can get his grub on here with their great selection of hearty sandwiches, pizzas, and of course the ginormous burgers.

It's a little pricier than your typical lunch fare but in this place you definitely get what you pay for.  My top recommendations for lunch are the Rancher salad or the Picnic sandwich - yum!  Watch out for the specials too, as they are always coming up with something new!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Warrant - Heaven)

I've got a review for your place
And I'm ordering in the line
It's Brie and Cheese and Pizza
And it's looking pretty good

See the waiter going to work
Pouring wine in the glass
The memories are great and man they're really coming back

I need to be the king of the world!
As long as I go Bo Bites this little place!

Liberty Market isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday 
No matter what my reviews might say


The Liberty Market has been around since the 1930's!  Geez what took me so long to find this gem!?

With a tad bit of modernization and love, the Liberty Market once a grocery store is now an urban bistro restaurant serving clean and fresh cooked entrees in the heart of Old Town Gilbert.  I came here with a friend and shared a few things from the menu.  We started with the Roasted Brie Plate, then ordered the Chopped Salad and Margherita Pizza with pepperoni.  

The Brie Plate was fun and well plated; it came with Brie, crustinis, a spring mix salad, green apples, roasted garlic, caramelized pecans, and a guava glaze.  Overall a nice clean start to our dining experience.  The sweet glaze was perfect with our our salad while the pecan provided a crunchy texture.  The Brie we mashed with our crustini bread and topped with our apples - indeed a killer combination!  The chopped salad was lovely mix of kale, cabbage, chicken, dried apricots, jicama, pumpkin seeds, cotija cheese, corn, and a honey serrano vinaigrette; which boggled us for some times during diner!  It was spicy but we couldn't figure out why haha!  In the end, it worked in our palates and a definite must get if you ever attend.  The Margharita pizza was fire wood cooked and simply put; a way to end my dining experience since the dough was soft and crunchy and the pepperoni provided and nice salty bite along with the subtle basils!

Service overall was attentive and kind and the ambiance was open and gave you that  urban city feel. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Liberty Market is a 4.45 star rated place for me.  Some days its 4 stars and on some days it's a 5 star, but most of the time is a solid 4 stars for me.  It's a great place to bring the family for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  We pick the Liberty Market over the other places in the area more often than not when we go to see a play at the theater. 

The food ~ most everything is very fresh and taste very good.  I had most of their sandwiches, burgers and a few pizza's.  Everything is usually prepared very well.  On a few occasions we've been disappointed with their consistency of how some things are prepared but again overall a very good experience!  You should always try to save room for desert!  Their deserts are super delish especially their oatmeal and ice cream cookie and their carrot cake.  

The dinning experience ~ I'm not a fan of waiting in line to order then setting and waiting.  It's a self serve place, which is okay especially considering their prices are very reasonable.  The folks that work here are always very friendly.  The restaurant is very comfortable and clean.  

The Liberty Market is a place I recommend to my friends and to you.  If you haven't been to the Liberty Market yet, why not?  Everyone else in the Gilbert and East valley have :-)"}
{"text":"Some of my favorites here: white pizza, BLT (with FENNEL!!!) caprese salad, and of course the salt river bar.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is the closest thing to La Grande Orange that the East Valley has. The staff is very courteous, and the food is so fresh and tasty. I love the Demi Breakfast (bacon pancake, eggs,grilled meatball - yes I said grilled meatball - toast & fruit) and the little shots of Cuban coffee for breakfast, and the pizza and salads for lunch or dinner. The baked goods are out of this world! (think red velvet cake and gigantic cinnamon rolls). Joe, the owner, is there quite a bit and is very nice - as are the rest of the staff. It's just a nice, pleasant, cool place to eat, drink coffee or shop for kitschy gifts and knick-knacks.Love it!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great. My waiters name was Nate, really good kid and I believe he deserves a raise, as I said customer service is very cheerful and helpful. The food is good as well, I got a meatball sandwich and it was spot on, my only problem is the food is expensive. Other than that this is a great spot to go with the family, I recommend getting a salt river bar for desert."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say ever about liberty. Staff is great and the food is So Good. The only negative thing is that the prices just keep going up unfortunately. Always busy there and always good!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food to-go here. It was a pretty long wait....  I was unfortunately a wee bit late to order breakfast (which sounds AMAAAAAAAZZZZZING)

Husband loved his Rancher sandwich. Sis-in-law loved her picnic salad. and I .... literally cannot remember what I ordered, except that I got a side of the caprese pasta salad. And that I liked my food. hah!

I'd love to make this place a regular spot, BUUUUT it's a bit of a drive from where we live, but if I'm ever venturing out to Gilbert, you know I'll be there!"}
{"text":"This was a hard one to review for me.

First of all - FIVE BIG AWESOME STARS FOR THE FOOD!!!

This food is crazy delicious.  Like, just from one dish, I know all of the others are going to be on my most wanted list.

Everything is fresh, and well prepared, and so frickin' TASTY.

I would give more stars for the food.

I came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and had the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth green chile pork scrambled into eggs and cheese, with a wonderful chunky biscuit, Liberty potatoes (think chunky potato-au-gratin but better), and I added a blueberry, bacon pancake on the side.

I could not have been more satisfied with the food.

However.

The service system is not my style. I give it 2.5 stars. Barely.
Mostly because the awesomeness of the food should pair with some seriously awesome service.

In IHOP, I expect IHOP food and service, and one does not out-do the other.  

But here you get down-home local goodness, matched with so-so service. It just doesn't compute.

You walk in.  Wait in a line of about 15+ people with only 1 cash register (this just seemed unnecessary.  why can't i just sit down and someone take my order like every other not-that-great restaurant?), and then random people bring out your food, and random people wander around the dining area looking more interested in cleaning off tables, than on actually serving the diners.

I had to ask like 3 \"dining room attendants\" for the same thing (just some salsa) before one of them actually returned after I'd basically finished.
But I had barely left my seat when they were already clearing off my dishes.
The service vibe just didn't go with the great food, decor and build up.

I guess it's all about expectation.  If I'd read more reviews I would have known and maybe not have been so disappointed, but still.  This food DESERVES good service.

Definitely eat here, but don't expect personal dining service."}
{"text":"My first time at Liberty Market was after I had left Gilbert and gone off to college. How could I have lived in Gilbert for 10 years and never ate at Liberty Market?!

It's a good thing my friend told me I ABSOLUTELY HAD to come here! Liberty Market is fantastic! There is food is great; all of it is great. There's nothing on the menu that is unappetizing. If you can't pick, just close your eyes and point somewhere on the menu. You'll love it even if it's something you've never had before.

Now, I always come to Liberty Market whenever I come back to Gilbert."}
{"text":"OMG AMAZING! You CAN NOT I REPEAT CAN NOT go wrong coming here to eat. I have been here over a dozen times now and I have not once had a bad experience. I have had Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and each time it has been exceptional. David and Julie are Literally the BOMB.COM great customer service from the staff team here and they can recommended anything off the menu if you tell them what you are craving. I will forever be a LibertyMarketCustomer!!! Thank you for the amazing food and great customer service each and everything time. Keep killing it guys! xoxo"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hub bub is about with this place. I frequent many amazing organic and slow food restaurants in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas, and I was excited to go out of my box to try something new. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I had their chicken sandwich and a mocha from their highly recommended coffee shop, and neither really wowed me. For starters I tried to healthy up my sandwich by having it on wheat bread. I guess that was a mistake because the bread seamed stale and very dry. I also expect when I go to a coffee place for them to have more than 2% milk and cream.. For a place that is supposed to be healthy they sure don't have many options that allow you to go that route. 

On a side note the staff was very pleasant and despite the very long line we didn't have to wait long to get our food. I will give them another chance if I find myself near Downtown Gilbert around breakfast or lunch, but I'll be steering clear of their coffee next time."}
{"text":"My food came out right. My friends didn't come out right. It took way too long for the food. The manager without question gave us a card equaling the price of the meal and coffee to use next time. We do not go out to eat hoping to get free stuff, we prefer just a good experience but when the service or food doesn't meet reasonable expectations we do agree it's the restaurants responsibility to make it right. Both managers were nice and prompt with making it right. 
We are grateful for this awesome service and experience because we really want and will return to explore more on the menu. Our food was outstanding. Ambiance and variety is awesome. Huge Cinnamon roll can be shared and is bread like but still sweet. Carrot cake is amazing. Green chile pork and eggs was lean and hearty. Biscuit is buttery and so tasty. Pancakes were soft, creamy and tasty. Pizza next to us looked so good. Must come back. 
The restaurant is first order and then sit style. The staff was helping to facilitate seating during the rush which was nice. 

Anyhow thank you Liberty Market for  confirming our reasons to come back and spend our money."}
{"text":"I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!"}
{"text":"A great fast casual place for lunch in downtown Gilbert! You can tell the food here is very fresh, and many of the dishes are unique. I feel like you could frequent this place, and there would always we new things you would want to try. My food has always been great, and everyone else's look mighty tempting as well!

Every sandwich or burger I've tried has had some type of special sauce or ingredients that really makes it stand out compared to other places. It's random, but I also really like that they have a few different types of fresh side dishes to choose from. They are displayed in a case you walk by before ordering, so you can choose the one that looks yummiest. 

Speaking of yummy, I have not gone over the edge and indulged in their dessert, but  they offer plenty of options, and they all look amazing. A friend and I agreed, we just wanted to ask for a fork and take a bite out of everything in their stinkin case!! 

The place itself is always very clean. Its busy, but the line moves fast and the food comes out quick. It is not full service, but the staff is friendly, and they definitely get the job done well!"}
{"text":"I met a cute Yelp friend for lunch at Liberty Market yesterday.  I'd heard about Liberty for a couple of years now and was really looking forward to checking it out.

Parking can be a little tough but once inside the building the fun begins.  The exposed brick, steel and wood provide a very comfortable, open and contemporary look and feel.

The menu is really quite large.  I decided to go with the Rancher sandwich.  It is pressed (like a panini) which I like.  Roast beef, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula and horseradish give it some zip. Really, a very good sandwich.  The side caprese pasta salad was excellent as well.

I'd like to come back and try their other sandwiches, salads and pizza.  It all looks good.

Thanks Liberty Market for such a nice lunch!"}
{"text":"I watched my two friends enjoy their meals while I embarrassingly tried my best to finish my extremely disappointing Lox & Bagel. I really should've just requested to change my meal out or something. 

I got their Lox & Bagel for breakfast. Unintentionally their most expensive item for breakfast at $13. It's listed right below their sandwiches which made me to believe that it too was a sandwich... a bagel sandwich... It wasn't. Nor was it assembled in halves. I'm still very confused about how this was served. Why must I work to setup my own food? Especially breakfast while I'm half awake!?!

But that's not the main problem. After quickly trying to spread the cream cheese onto the bagel and then assembling a tradition Lox Bagel sandwich, I tried my best to cut the bagel into two. The bagel was a very hard over toasted crunch on the outside and an unpleasant tough stale-like chewy inner. This not only was a challenge for my knife, it was also a task on my teeth and jaws as I tried to take my first bite. The bagel really ruined any last possibility of this being an enjoyable breakfast for me.

Maybe it was my lack of sleep that didn't immediately complain or at least notify the staff to at least offer another bagel. Maybe I'm just non confrontational in person. Maybe I was too embarrassed to be dissatisfied with my expensive breakfast in front of my two friends who both got delicious looking meals before mine even came out.... unassembled...

I should've gotten the smothered burrito..."}
{"text":"I haven't been inside personally but whenever my mom comes from Orange County she always goes and she brings us GF goodies like their rice pudding and everything tastes so good! Never a reaction either."}
{"text":"Having visited this restaurant on numerous occasions, I knew I needed to write an updated review.  The double Cortadito is a favorite when I am in the mood for coffee.  Breakfast is exceptional and the \"Best Chicken Sandwich\" is entirely aptly named, so much so that I rarely order other items, though I have on occasion enough to know that everything here is good."}
{"text":"Unique restaurant in downtown Gilbert.  Flavorful food.  Seating can be limited at times"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I don't like this whole stand in line to order thing. The line was out the door but the food is why.  Fresh and yummy so I'll begrudgingly wait in the line."}
{"text":"From the service down to the food, this place has NEVER failed me. Every single time I have been here and brought new people with me, we all leave incredibly impressed and full might I add. 

I discovered this place a while ago and while I live in Central Phoenix (a good 35 mile drive) I still venture out AT LEAST once a month for a taste of the delicious freshly prepared food! The entire staff is friendly and helpful, making you feel at home and welcome. The food is always incredible and big enough portions to share. 

A few of my own suggestions on \"must haves\"

salt river bar- omg amazing
griddled bread pudding- delicious
veggie scramble- I add chicken because I am not a vegatrian but the goat cheese and combo of everything is simply to die for

For lunch try the rancher, amazing!"}
{"text":"Being a West Valley girl, I was a bit excited about venturing to Gilbert to try something new. Liberty Market was pretty much awesome. After hearing it compared to La Grande Orange in Central Phoenix, I was intrigued. LGO is one of my favorite places to have a meeting or lunch with clients.....

I can say that I liked Liberty Market even better! I had the White Pizza, as did one of my dinner companions, and it was very good AND reasonably priced. My other friend had the Far East salad with Chicken. All of us were very satisfied with our choices. 

It was not too crowded, but also was a Tuesday night around 6PM, so based on previous Yelpers statements I can see how it would be loud if it were crowded. I would definitely come back here! Too bad I live 40 miles away. But a girl can dream....."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast one day with my fiancé just to try something new and let me tell you this was the best breakfast I've ever had. I decided to go with the breakfast quesadilla and it was fantastic. If you ever close by this place go in and try it because it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Is Liberty Market my favorite place to eat? No, but it is unique, sits in downtown Gilbert and just has that \"likeability\" quality. Their food choices are classic (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) and for the most part, tasty. I like the ambience inside, everything is wide open and welcoming. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. I guess I just can't say I love anything I've tried here. The margherita pizza to me doesn't really resemble a margherita pizza. There aren't slices of tomato, basil and mozzarella on top but sliced really thin and almost could pass a cheese pizza without the small strips of basil on top. I also recently ventured to try a dessert, which was highly recommended by the cashier, and I really hated it. I don't remember the name of it but it was essentially a brownie/cookie made with corn flakes. It was overly sweet and had a very odd texture. No go for me! I recall breakfast choices being better and might go again soon to recall my distant memory."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and I eat out every day. 5 stars is deserved for this place. Loved it! 
 
1 star for parking (seems to be in a small downtown area)
1 star for the ordering (since it was my first time, I stood in the entry for a few minutes waiting for a host with a menu in hand)
3 stars for pricing ( $25 for a lunch --soup & salad combo, 2 smallest sides & 2 desserts) 
5 stars for ambiance 
5 stars for quality of food
5 stars for taste of food
 I tried the farmers salad (did not disappoint! ) 
And we were nervous about trying the sweet potato muffin, it was great!!)
4 stars for portion sizes (the small sides were about 1/2 cup to a cup )
4 stars for service.




Overall, I Absolutley loved this divey spot."}
{"text":"Not sure if we'll go back. Went there on a Saturday for lunch and expected it to be busy - it was, but no problem. Greeter was pleasant and immediately handed us menus and explained how the system worked (read menu while in line, order at end, take number and find table). The nice thing about waiting in line is that you watch the meals being made! I also watched a cook dump someone's plated lasagna on the floor - clearly a new cook. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the side of roasted sweet potato salad, my lunch-buddy ordered the burger of the day, the bison burger, with chips. The food arrived pretty quickly considering the crowd (a very noisy crowd...but again, to be expected at lunch on Saturday), and nice and hot. But...the Cuban sandwich had absolutely no flavor. It was dry and I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be a Cuban. The roasted sweet potato salad was mushy and congealed  in goo - I took 1 bite and offered it to my lunch-buddy in case I was being overly picky. He made such a face, I know it wasn't just me. Since we split the Cuban and burger, I asked his take on the Cuban. He took a bite and dumped the rest. The bison burger, luckily, was great. The chips with the burger were standard out-of-the-bag chips. Three sauces were served with the burger - a bottled ketchup, a bizarre canned pineapple sauce(?!), and a tasteless orange mayonnaise that I think was supposed to be \"spicey aioli.\" I've heard such good things about Liberty Market that this was a real disappointment - most of the food we tried was dismal. The bison burger didn't redeem the meal. I may try this in the future, but there's too many other places to try. Step up the quality Liberty."}
{"text":"Take a step back in history while enjoying some excellent food and drink.  Very good food with large portions for a fair price. Whoever led the renovation should be ;commended as it is a perfect blend of modern comfort, interesting design and a respect for the history of the building."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We come here almost every weekend. The pancakes are the best I've ever had. The service can be hit or miss but the food is so amazing I don't care! I love that they care about their community and try to buy local as much as they can."}
{"text":"Always have such good food. Breakfast, lunch, dinner or desert you won't be disappointed! The only downside is that there is no waiter service. With their price point I'd rather sit down than wait in line to order."}
{"text":"This place had great food. It's a little weird because you stand in line and order your food at the counter and then you sit down and they bring you the order. I would like it better as a regular sit down restaurant. It just has more of a sit down restaurant feel. But whatever. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food!! The staff is always friendly l! They have a great selection in healthy food choices! I love that they serve Irish cream
Coffee too!! :)"}
{"text":"If you are in downtown Gilbert, this is a place to hit up. The food is good, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is cool. There are so many options in downtown, so if you are confused, just go to Liberty. Liberty has so many options in one place."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty. However, I had so many disappointments today that I will not be returning in the near future. In the lunch menu, most items are based on bread or pasta, about which I was disappointed. I would expect from such a nice restaurant that there would be more variety in the ingredients. My strong suggestion, to avoid standing in line, is to avoid Fridays through Sundays. We arrived on a Sunday at 12:30 PM, and waited in line, inside the restaurant, for an hour. One gives one's order at the register at end of the line before having a chance to sit down. While waiting in line, the staff stopped taking orders for at least 20 minutes without informing anyone in line. At the register, when I asked why no orders were taken, I was told that no tables had been open. However, during our wait, most of chairs at the shared tables were always available. My guess is that the restaurant was understaffed that day. When I asked if not taking orders was unusual, I was told that this is typical on Fridays through Sundays. The staff chose our table for us. We sat in hard chairs next to three empty booths with cushioned seats. So, perhaps this is not the restaurant to choose for entertaining your elders. The dessert items in the cases, although mostly bready, appeared delicious, but there are no prices listed. I didn't want to hold up the line further by asking about prices. There was an extra charge on my receipt for gluten free bread which was not listed on the menu nor mentioned when I placed my order. In case this is a concern for you, the bathrooms stalls, bathroom sinks, and bathroom mirrors are shared by both genders. Unfortunately, for the first stall into which I walked, the previous occupant apparently had been unable to 'hit the target'. I did not feel comfortable enough in front of the mirrors to reapply makeup. Finally, although not technically the fault of the restaurant, the patrons in line ahead of us and others allowed a total of a dozen friends/family into the line with them, over our first 15 minutes of waiting. One of these individuals was also on the phone asking if she should stand in line at the restaurant across the street to see where they could get into first. I assume these groups were from out of town. Most people who live in Gilbert know better than to be so rude."}
{"text":"Liberty Market? More like Socialist Market. One of the foundational principles of economic liberty is competition, which keeps prices low and quality high. This place charges $7.50 for two biscuits and some gravy and $3.50 for one pancake. While the atmosphere is nice and the food is descent, the price is high."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I decided to come back and give this place another try. I'm glad I did. The burger I had was amazing, the food came out reasonably fast, and the chocolate death Ray cake was so so good. My wife had a farmer's pressed sandwich that was also really good. Probably a little more expensive than I thought it should have been, but overall, I'm now willing to put this place on my list of regular spots."}
{"text":"Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isn't Denny's or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus. 

The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.  

We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the 'Rents."}
{"text":"This place was hyped up so much!!! Finally had a chance to try it out. 

Love the outside and the vibe inside. Very clean and trendy vibe. I always see a line out of the door all weekend long. 

In general, I dont understand the order at the counter setup at restaurants. I feel like it takes away from the dining experience. Plus its setup like this AND its still expensive!? 

I was pretty let down by the menu and the portions. The menu is just one page of items you can get anywhere. Nothing special, no different takes on any dishes. All of the dishes were pretty expensive considering the portion and basic dishes. 

I got the White Pizza which was bleh. Hardly any flavor in the white sauce. Chicken seemed like it was just boiled and diced. Hardly any flavor standing out besides the bacon. you cant screw up bacon I guess. the pizza dough was pretty good though. Small 10in pizza for like $15!! Major let down. 

We all finished our dishes and majority of us were still hungry. We're not fat people either. 

Overall, I cant say I'll be back."}
{"text":"An upper-scale place
with the food prices to match.
Not the cheapest place.

Stopped by for dessert
and used a birthday discount
on the bread pudding.

Oh my, this dessert.
It was a good size to share
with two other friends.

Bread was different
from the first time I tried it;
had berries this time.

Busy Friday night.
Dish took long time to arrive.
Almost half an hour.

Bread base was lukewarm,
but cream on top was still cool.
Wish it was fresher.

Friend purchased side fries.
Expensive and small portioned.
Not the best value.

The fries tasted great,
but we just wished there was more.
Wasn't made to share."}
{"text":"I Ordered the macaroni and cheese burger. I was truly in heaven! Burger was cooked to perfection and the Mac-n-cheese was so creamy and hearty, it was a meal in itself. The girl that took the order was sweet and explained the ordering process, I think she knew were a little confused.  We will definitely visit again and again..."}
{"text":"We as a family go out to eat about once a week. We were looking for a place to go and our friend suggested this place as one of his favorite places, so we went there. We got there early on a Friday night so the line wasn't that bad. We placed our order and my husband(being on a special diet) had a tough time making his selection. After a while of struggling to find something, a chef came over and helped him make a selection that would work for his diet. My 8 year old daughter also spied the deserts immediately and wanted to order one. Again, the staff was nice and friendly and arranged for the desert to be brought out after our food.  



  We sat outside since it was a lovely evening. The patio is really gorgeous. We waited a bit for our food but in the meantime we went into the bathrooms which are each unique in their own way. As an added bonus you can watch the kitchen from the patio and you get to walk past the kitchen when you go to the bathroom. After a while our food came out and the presentation was wonderful. My daughter had the margarita pizza which I figured she wouldn't eat all of it but she ended up devouring it all and declaring how good it tasted. I had the salmon BLT which didn't disappoint and my husband had the Cuban sandwich which he said has been by far the best thing he's eaten on his crazy diet. The spice tart cake that my daughter and I split was to die for! The little spice cakes were rich but not too rich and the cinnamon apples were perfectly cooked. We will be going back here for sure to try out more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Salt river bars are my fav. It's kind of crowded inside, but its good."}
{"text":"This place is yummy.. The bread pudding is soooooo delicious!  It was pretty packed when we went but they are very organized and the line seemed to move quickly! Staff was very friendly, the only complaint was the cashier/order taker.. She was rude, unfriendly and acted as if you were bothering her! That was our only downside so I give it 5 stars still!!"}
{"text":"I showed up after the lunch rush about 1 o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday, and immediately went to the coffee bar and orders a cappuccino. It came promptly,  it was very good. A+

After sitting there drinking my coffee and doing some work on my laptop, I decided to order something to eat. I have to say, the service there isn't great. There was 1 person  in line, and after she rang up the person in front of me, I had to wait 2 minutes before the lady looked up at me. I think she was busy folding napkins. She seemed totally confused and didn't get my order right. 

When she brought me my hamburger, she didn't offer me any utensils, or a napkin, or salt-and-pepper, or any condiments. I had to walk up to the bar to ask her for that. Also in addition, I asked three separate times for a to go container. I never received it, finally walking out. I eat out 7 to 10 times a week, and quite frankly that was the nicest but most incompetent service I  have received in a very long time

At  $14, the burger with avocado wasn't great. I asked for the bacon, but never received the bacon. 

Still, the ambience is great, the pastries and baked goods look amazing!. I would come back just for the coffee, Internet  and maybe a scone or something like that. Also even though the service was poor, all of the ladies there were extremely nice."}
{"text":"Love liberty market! My favorite things there are the iced coffee and the salt river bar. Everything else is really good, but I come back especially for those things. The atmosphere is awesome and has the cool trendy feel to it.  It's a great spot to grab a meal or coffee.  You can tell they actually know what they are doing. If you come in on your birthday, they will give you $10 off your meal. Stop by and check it out."}
{"text":"My recomendation will fall short of the praise this place deserves, staff is awesome, patrons are friendly and the six alarm burger is sensational!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Yummy food and a great place to enjoy downtown Gilbert. Breakfast is our go to here but you really can't go wrong with any meal!"}
{"text":"So apparently I haven't written a review for Liberty Market which is so bad of me since I have been a regular for years.  When I finally found downtown Gilbert after moving to the east valley in 2008, I was searching for a restaurant that made me feel like home.  Thankfully I found Liberty Market and was welcomed with open arms immediately.  I was always greeted with a smile and the employees remembered my name.  

The only way I can think to describe the layout is innovative and exciting.  What other restaurant is showcased for their bathrooms?  Some of the individual bathrooms have recipes for some of the food written on the walls.  I can honestly say that this is the only time I have ever spent an extended amount of time in the bathroom.

The chef never rests on his laurels and has weekly and weekend specials that are always delicious.  My staples on the menu are the salmon BLT, the picnic salad, any pizza out of the wood fire oven, the roasted sweet potato salad, and the chai tea.  I've been told that they make the tea fresh from scratch and it is the best I have ever tasted.

The desserts change on a regular basis as well and they have some of the biggest cinnamon rolls and cakes I have ever seen.  One of the specials was sticky toffee pudding and it was to die for.  You get to look in the case while you stand in line so not some type of sweet treat is out of the question.

I just love this restaurant and the owners!!  We are very lucky to have such a high quality restaurant in our own backyard."}
{"text":"Oh Liberty! I want to love you but your service is too dang slow...busy/not busy (like now..there is only one other couple on the patio on a weekday morning).  It doesn't matter what I order..today it's lox and a bagel (that requires NO cooking).  I waited for 25 min (I know b/c I looked at my receipt) got up and gave it to someone who works there...magically my food appeared 5 minutes later.  No apology...no explanation...and I had to ask for silverware :(  I can't see myself coming back here unless I'm not hungry and don't care when I get my food."}
{"text":"Wow... amazing breakfast with just the right amount of heat. Coffee was great too. New favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Was looking through my food pictures from the last couple months and stumbled upon these pictures from last time I came to Liberty Market. I've only been here for breakfast, but it is definitely one of my top three restaurants in Gilbert. With a light and open atmosphere, and the idea that you are eating locally sourced and real food, it is truly a great dining experience. I always indulge when I'm here, who can resist those amazing fresh rolls and buns?? Go early on weekends if you want a chance to try their amazing sticky buns. But there are definitely fresh and healthy options, so everyone should be able to find something they enjoy here. Everything was delicious the last time I was there, and I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert. 

Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.  We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!! 

There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items.

I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Liberty Market is yummy! 
I love coming here after a good work out. They have a wide variety of food choices, healthy or fatty... they're all good. I love the atmosphere in this place, it's so clean!

My only complaint, it's a bit pricey.... for what you get..."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! Though I couldn't afford to go here everyday I absolutely love this place. Their Far East salad is fantastic and get an oatmeal cream pie to go! Service can be a bit slow but they are constantly bringing out dishes and it doesn't appear like anybody is just standing around.  Their food is well worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Drove my butt across town to Gilbert for brunch with some friends.  Yes, it is a 50 min for me.  But it is worth it for some people.  :)  This place is crazy packed.  I was in line, a LONG line.  Waited for 20 mins... moving at snail speed.  It was a nice modern vibie restaurant.  You order, we will find you a table.  My friends have already ordered, sat, and was eating...  They have kids, so they are forgiven.  I was informed that if my party has a table, I can go to the bar area and place my order since I had a table #.  Good to know after waiting 20 mins.  But after I ordered, the food came out pretty quick and it was very good too!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so popular! I had breakfast here that has pancakes, bacon, and eggs for $14...and it didn't even taste all that great. I can go to Denny's and build my own grand slam for $6 and it'll be more satisfying."}
{"text":"Can this be true?!?!?!

So I consider myself a Foodie, duh, why else would I be on yelp! Anyway, as a foodie, I'm sure you know, you only really love one or two dishes at a particular restaurant, all else just doesn't make the cut. Well, at Liberty I have found a new challenge... finding something that I don't like...

No, really! I have spend literally hours at this place, working my way though the menu and all I have found is great, well executed, delicious, dishes! You know, that ones you take that first bite, someone that actually loves their job just created this dish for you.

I truly love this place, from the moment you walk in the door, you know your not in a typical restaurant and the E61Bar just demands your attention.

The staff is friendly and knows the menu inside & out and if you stick around long enough, Chef David will probably swing on by to say hello. This place knows how to make you feel welcome, at least in my book.


On a side note, my wife and I decided to join Liberty Market for one of their Community Dinners. This is a dinner, usually reserved for 40 or so guests with a 5+ course with beer or wine pairing. All I can say is, AMAZING!!!

So if you ever have the opportunity to swing on by or even join them for their Community Dinners, please do, this place is truly amazing!"}
{"text":"The food's ok, but nothing too exciting. Service is good. Location in downtown Gilbert means it's often a little crazier parking than I'd like. It's not a place to go out of your way to find, but worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Is it just me or shouldn't a cafeteria-style of service include cafeteria-style prices? The food was just ok, the pizza was great, but my daughters thought the bathroom was awesome. I'll return to try the breakfast since I live close by and I've heard good things about it, but I doubt I'll return for dinner. I would rather dine with actual service if I'm paying for a restaurant. It works at the more casual Joes BBQ, but here it doesn't seem to match the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for something delicious but not heavy.  \"The picnic\" sandwich is great and the sweet potato side they have is amazing!  Definitely a regular in the rotation."}
{"text":"We love this place! It has GF bread as option for breakfast (unsure about lunch/dinner), and has great portions that are split-able. Liberty used to serve Stumptown coffee which was a huge perk for me to go, but last time we were in, I didn't see it. One way that Liberty could get to 5/5 stars is if their coffee prep was taken to the next level. The coffee is good, but the focus of the restaurant is on its food (makes sense).

Go on your birthday for $10 off your meal!"}
{"text":"What a great place, all around genuine, professional service from management down to ever server you pass. 
Usually the food is the standout but service is what set it over the top for me! That 6 Alarm Burger though. Wow. Ill be back for the smiles and the food. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Normally we go to the breakfast spot around the corner, and with a longer than normal wait at our usual place we decided  to give Liberty Market a try.  The place is nice on the inside and the pastries on display look amazing.  So we ordered our food, the items on the menu look really good.  The food arrives and my Wife starts looking at the eggs strangely. I asked her what was wrong.  She slid the plate over to me and there were several long hairs cooked into the scrabbled eggs; GROSS!! So my kids, Mom, and me looked through the rest of our food, before calling the manager over.   Thank goodness we only found the embedded hairs in one set of scrabbled eggs.   We called the manager over and they apologized, and said they would bring a new plate of eggs out, which I expected. However in any restaurant I have ever been to, Management at the very least will cover the cost of the plate, but normally will comp the meal and/or give you a gift  certificate, so you will come back. Were we offered any of those from the management?  NO!!   The food is good, but not off the wall good like others have reviewed.   We all had different versions of the Demi-plate.   There are lots of places to eat and not management not offering to at least comp the plate of eggs ($3.50) is just bad business. If we had  been given a gift certificate, to come back,  we probably never would want to.  Next time we will wait an hour to go next door instead."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say i am a liberty market fan quite yet.
I ordered two orders for work one day hoping to be amazed and in complete awe in every bite i took. This was not the case.  My first order was the scramble with Italian sausage, mozzarella, and i believe sun dried tomatoes because they were a little too sweet for my liking. it was mediocre. something i definitely wont order again. The second order was the griddle bread pudding...yikes. i wasn't expecting those flavors what so ever. it reminded me of uncooked french toast with the texture of french toast and flan put together. i actually enjoyed it so much more the day after when it was a little cold after heating it up a couple of seconds and taking a bite with syrupy goodness. still not a favorite though. i will give them another chance though so until then they only get 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"The potential is there, but I think I just got an off dish! 

We came after lunch hour, so the place was pretty empty. The service was friendly and their variety of food and desserts can satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. 

Ordered: Medium Po' Boy Burger. 
It was the special and the cashier said it was hands down the best thing on the menu... how could I resist? After an early morning flight with nothing but a Kind bar in my stomach, I was ready to inhale the thing. I was a bit suspicious when my burger arrived much later than my friend's personal pizza, but it was validated when I looked at the inside of my burger bun and it was pretty charred. I cut my giant burger in half and sadly, no pink. Gah! The meat? Salty. The side of chips? SO SALTY! I had to scrape off the chunks of salt off each chip...and at some point I gave up on the chips and just chugged water. Although, I'm starting to think that maybe Phoenix just uses more salt than SF? IDK. 

The concept was there and had they paid more attention to the food, I think it would have been a pretty damn good burger. 

If I'm ever in town, I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"I held a birthday brunch here for my family which was a party of ten.  I was able to make a reservation and we all had a wonderful time.  The table was set up off to the side. The food was delicious and the desserts were amazing.  A good time was had by all. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Just as some others have mentioned, the food is pretty good. It is standard fare Americana with a slight Hipster lean.

The thing I don't like about this place (and Joe's 2 other places) is the cattle call style ordering system. I don't know why but it makes me feel like they are saying: \"We don't care enough about you to have real waitstaff. Get your own damn drink."}
{"text":"This is so cute! I love the decor and the set up. My husband and I went there for breakfast a few days ago. I got the veggie scramble and my husband got the green chili pork scramble. Everything was great!  I especially loved the potatoes! So flavorful! Not to mention the biscuit with honey! Yum!! Also, it is never too early to have a macaroon or two! We got the blueberry and pistachio! They were perfection. Too bad they were a little pricey otherwise I would have bought several more! Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu and other baked goods!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now so I'm free to say what I please. First off, the place is super-crowded and the set up is way too confusing. Two: checking out and waiting in line to get your food is inconvenient. Three: food is very very subpar  had been that way every time I went there. Macarons were HORRIBLE, pasta is alright, sides could have been bought at the grocery store. Also I was hassled by the manager. After ordering and paying for my food, she informed me to sit at the bar or a table to accommodate more people rather than at a booth. Little did this employee know I was actually meeting someone, already reserved a table, and there were no other places to sit. Very rude and unprofessional on the manager/waitresses part!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and tried the cortadito coffee as well as the chilaquiles w egg; girlfriend had the beet salad. everything had a good flavor :) The atmosphere of the restaurant as well as the area were fun with a bit of history."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a dozen times and always had a very positive experience.  The environment is warm, the service is fast.  Other reviews have coverd all the points.  I just wanted to submit a review to add my 5-stars!


Favorite dishes are actually the daily specials- once in awhile they do a veal ragu pasta (pappardelle noodles) which is just awesome."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but it is the kind of place that draws me in.  The food is creative and the service is always good.  Smiling friendly faces that are always helpful.  I don't get into old-town Gilbert often but when I do it is the place I seem always land at.  If you haven't been, I reccomend it."}
{"text":"The good:  The food is delicous.  I got a breakfast sandwich with chipotle cream cheese that was to die for that last time we stopped in.  We also shared a blueberry scone that blew every other scone I've ever had out of the water.  It comes with an amazing cream (basically English clotted cream) that made the scone even more moist and delicous.  

The bad:  The waiting in a long line to order, then waiting again for your food.  I also don't enjoy that they don't let you pick your own table.  We were sat in the middle of two other tables that were so close to eachother that we could barely sit down or get up.  The woman's baby at the table next to ours was so close the kid kept trying to grab our food."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is one of the best things about Gilbert. I've been here many times, with both family and friends. I love the look and feel of the restaurant, from the open kitchen to the coffee bar. And the food is always fantastic. I usually order the white pizza (pine nuts make the pizza taste so amazing) and my dad likes to get the tower burger. I've tried a few sandwiches and they are all good. The other day I tried the pasta bowl for the first time and I might start ordering that from now on. Everything is super fresh. You simply cannot live in (or visit) Gilbert without eating at Liberty Market at least once."}
{"text":"Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market."}
{"text":"Like Channele C. said, I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place yet....:)

We have been here numerous times and each time, I've ordered something different whether breakfast or lunch and it is always pretty damn tasty!

The service is amazingly friendly and helpful even when its busy. They really do try to accommodate whatever seating preference you may have.

Have I mentioned the food?!?! If you haven't tried; chorizo queso dip, cheeseburger, buffalo fries, chorizo quesadilla, roast beef dip, salmon sandwich or the crab po boy, well then you are missing out!

Oh and the desserts! Yum- try their scones"}
{"text":"I love their green chili pork scramble. It's one of my favorite breakfast dishes anywhere. The flavor of the green chili pork is out of this world. The Liberty potatoes and biscuits are also fantastic. The pancakes are good, but not amazing--not worth the price. (One small side pancake is $3.50, which is ridiculous.)

I love the relaxed vibe inside, and the decor is great. But I wish they'd do breakfast/brunch with full service. That's my one complaint. It's just kind of a hassle to have to wait in line, find a table, get your own drinks and refills, etc., when you're trying to talk to friends/family.  It feels chaotic and kind of interrupts the experience. 

Also, on the weekend, get there early for brunch--no later than 8:30 if you don't want an insane wait."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a trendy diner style restaurant in adorable Downtown Gilbert. I've always heard amazing things about this place, great food & nice atmosphere. For my first time there I can absolutely speak to the positive reviews. I dined with 3 gal pals and after ordering, one of our entrees was out in 20 minutes or less. Unfortunately there was a long delay before the other 3 dishes where anywhere in sight. We got the attention of a waiter and asked if they knew when we'd be getting our food. The staff worked quickly to find our plates only to realize our tickets were lost/misplaced. Our waiter came back apologized profusely and immediately owned up to the error and comped all of our meals even the one that was out promptly. This was clearly a one off situation that could have been handled poorly but they were quick to make it right. I will definitely be a repeat patron!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Tried the margarita pizza, chocolate cake, and the caramel salted bar. Let me start with the pizza. It was absolutely delicious and was cooked perfectly (nice golden brown bottom, and the crust was awesome). The chocolate cake was honestly the highlight of my meal as it was oh so chocolatey and moist. The ganache that it was layered with was rich but not too rich. Lastly the famous salted caramel bar is my only lowlight (I know people will not agree with me). The bar itself was a bit too salty for me and wasn't that good. I might try it again in the future but dented an otherwise perfect meal at Liberty Market."}
{"text":"So I too had great expectations for this place and was very disappointed. The ordering system is weird, the wait time was too long, and the food was just not that great.  I ordered the white pizza and it had no taste at all. My husband ordered the supreme pizza and it was actually decent. That's why I gave this place two stars.  It was too expensive for what we got and we won't be back."}
{"text":"We love the pizzas & salad here. The atmosphere is fun. This is a good spot for a large group or for dinner for two. It's hard to find parking tho."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at Liberty Market today. I was a bit disappointed the chicken Apple sausage was no longer on the menu, but John was an amazing host and quickly helped me find something else on the menu. John is a great asset to the restaurant and really made our experience a five star experience. His warm and welcoming personality makes Liberty a place I'll definitely keep on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was very impressed! There were about 4 items on the menu I was dying to try, but I went with the White Pizza (chicken, white sauce, pine nuts, garlic, arugula) - AMAZING. So much flavor, fresh ingredients, delicious to the last bite. I shared with my husband although I didn't want to. 

The only reason for 4/5 stars is because we also ordered a homemade oatmeal cream pie to share for dessert, and they offered to bring it out after we finished our meal. When the waitress cleared our plates, she asked if we were waiting for anything else and we told her we ordered dessert. We sat there for another 20-25 minutes until someone finally brought it to us. I was annoyed, but the oatmeal cream pie was so incredible that I got over it quickly. Their case is full of homemade desserts, and I would definitely recommend trying at least one!

Can't wait to return and try more entrees!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is quite possibly the best burger in Phoenix...juicy, moist, not over done, not raw, and served with a killer pile of kettle chips. The condiments are excellent, the atmosphere is very modern and chic, the bar looks great, and the whole vibe of the place is trendy, and very forward thinking. Even the bathrooms are impressively styled--and CLEAN.
I will be back, and for burgers in the Gilbert area I don't know that this place can be beat!"}
{"text":"Great place for a business lunch or lunch with friends.  Had a fabulous sandwich, grilled ham and brie, and roasted green bean salad.  Nice, clean, friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Lots of delicious options, wide variety, quick and friendly service, nice setting.

When I walked in this place, I thought I was going to get OK, kinda overpriced food that was more trendy than actually good. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the variety of choices, particularly the delicious-looking pastries, side salads, and desserts, and tasted the food. There are a number of things that looked great, and I could only try so many things on my first visit, so I'll likely be coming back for more.

You order up at the cashier, and they bring your food to your table. The cashier was very helpful in figuring out exactly what was in a couple of the dishes that piqued my curiosity. There was a guy helping out with seating while we stood in line, so there was no question as to whether there was a table at which to sit after ordering food.

I ended up ordering the Chopped entree salad, which consists of kale, cabbage, grilled chicken, dried apricots, pumpkin seed brittle (I'm coming back to this), jicama, a couple of other ingredients, and a honey serrano vinaigrette. Everything on the salad was nice and fresh. I wouldn't have minded some more chicken in the salad, but what was in there was tasty. I ordered this in large part because of the dried apricots and kale, but when I got it and started eating, I quickly realized that the stars of the show are the pumpkin seed brittle and the honey serrano vinaigrette. The vinaigrette has a lovely flavor to it, and the spiciness adds a perfect level of heat to every bite of the salad. I'll admit that I'm a bit of a pepper belly and I love spiciness in practically everything, but this is really well executed. And every time I got a little chunk of that brittle, I got a little smile on my face. So good!

I also had a side of the sweet potato salad. I saw sweet potatoes and cranberries and knew I had to have some. It was a solid addition to my meal. I just realized that the cup is only $1 more than the side portion--I'll have to remember that next time, because the side portion was a tad small for my likings.

My friend shared her Best Chicken sandwich and rice pudding with me. The chicken sandwich, though maybe not the \"best ever\" as the person delivering it claimed, was certainly good. The chicken was juicy and tender, the avocado spread and chipotle vinaigrette added some nice flavor, and the sesame bun added some great crunchy texture and flavor. The tomatoes were pretty flavorless, and I am never a fan of iceberg lettuce. But it was definitely a solid sandwich! And the rice pudding was excellent. It reminded me of the arroz con leche my dad always made for us when I was a kid, and I had to hold back from eating a ton of it.

I saw other people's orders and thought that the pizzas looked great. The pastries and desserts all look excellent--I imagine that this place would be worth visiting just for those items. And brunch--I'm game.

I'm a fan. It's a good thing to get past that initial impression, because the food really is good."}
{"text":"got a pancake and double americano. Both were really good. Pancake was maybe a bit underdone but overall it was all very good. Didn't need to sugar the coffee."}
{"text":"I first saw this place months ago, and initially thought it was just a deli/market. I'm glad we finally decided to check it out.
The line to order was a bit intimidating, as it was quite long. However, they make sure they find you a table before you place your order.
The variety on the menu was actually more than I expected. By the time we got to order, I literally wanted to order everything. I settled for the Buffalo fries, weekly pizza, which was delicious, and a cinnamon roll, which was so huge I took most of it home.
They do have different breakfast, lunch, & dinner menus, so I'm pretty sure we'll have to come back."}
{"text":"Dear Gilbert,
Don't take this the wrong way, but I've never had a reason to come visit you. I'm sure I've skimmed your edges, or skirted just around you many times in the past. Sometimes maybe even on purpose. Sorry. You've probably seen me drive by and thought - \"There goes that prick again. Who does he think he is?\" But you're miles away. We don't have any friends inside you. You lacked a compelling draw to pull us out of our mid-town cocoon. Until now. So I hope we can put the past behind us and shed our preconceptions about each other and just move on with our relationship. So...

LIBERTY MARKET
What a refreshing, rewarding surprise. A hip, family-friendly, easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean, clever setting. The website hinted at its authenticity, but how many times does that fail you??

On the street, it's a nifty setting that harkens back to an Americana that I grew up with in the midwest: water tower, mid-century neon diner signage, real brick, public sidewalks intended for human use, trees, etc. But the building itself is a clean juxtaposition of modern worked into a cool old (by PHX standards) building. Old brick meets steel beams and open space. Everything is functional, not just there to look cool. From the structurally relevant beams to the authentic wood-fired oven, it all serves a real purpose.

We (me, wife and 9mo old daughter) chose our seats at the pizza oven counter and clamped on our baby's magical floaty chair. We immediately struck up a rapport with James, at the oven, and learned that almost everyone we encountered, other than customers, were his family and friends. That's pretty cool. We've now been several times and the food has never let us down. In fact, we've been drawn back almost weekly on our little pilgrimage to keep exploring the menu. I don't see a James Beard award in the future, unless they give one for consistently delicious, honest comfort food. But we're all happy to drive out of our way for a visit that puts a smile on our faces every time.

THAT CHRISTIAN THING
Now, to address something that really shouldn't matter, but often does to many people: \"The Christian Thing\". Due to the amount of interest in Agritopia and its \"Bible-based design\", I think most people know going in that this is a Joe Johnston place (Joe's Farm Grill, Real BBQ and now LM) and he's pretty open about his beliefs. I'm sure to the surprise of many who would avoid establishments that clearly identify as one religion or another, there is nothing in-your-face or proselytizing or patronizing about this place's pretty public Christian identity. If anything, the experience speaks volumes about the honesty of their description of their beliefs on the Liberty Market website. Yes, when you know about it going into it, you feel the presence of their faith. But all in a good way.

I almost feel like bringing this aspect of it up was unnecessary, but at the same time, I think it needed to be brought up; simply because of how many people I've talked to who immediately jumped on that angle - \"oh, the Bible Thumper enclave in Gilbert\", or \"sounds kinda Stepford-ish\", etc. If you just wandered in without any background info I think your takeaway would just be - \"Now that was a friendly group of people and a great meal.\"

Oh, and check out the bathrooms. It's fun.


So for what it is: friendly, sincere, fresh, honest, well-thought out, comfy, delicious, consistent, complete and did I mention friendly? - 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been going to Liberty Market ever since I was in high school, which was at least 6 years ago. This is one of the spots I make sure I go back to when I'm back in AZ.

I think this is a quintessential New American restaurant with a casual vibe and delicious food. Also, a staple of downtown Gilbert if I do say so myself. 

When you walk in, you line up to order at the register before getting a number and taking a seat. I usually go for lunch and occasionally dinner, but my experience with dinner is that it gets a bit crowded with a longer wait. 

My usual order is the Italia salad which is a lovely entree salad that more than fills me up. I usually have leftovers, and i can eat quite a bit. The salad consists of a bed of greens, salami, garbanzo beans, with a balsamic vinaigrette. They used to do a sandwich with similar ingredients and the same name, but that last time I went, I couldn't find it on the menu anymore. Which I was quite sad about, because that was my other main order. 

They also have a coffee bar in the corner for all your coffee needs. 

Overall, chill atmosphere and decent portions of New American done well.

Also, pro-tip, as with all the Joe's establishments, go here on your birthday for $10 towards anything you want. Just show your ID!"}
{"text":"Great food, I love the roast beef sandwich.  The deserts are also excellent and BIG.  It's nice to have some non-chain restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"\"Mm-hmm! This is a tasty burger!... I do love the taste of a good burger. Mmm.\"
-Samuel L. Jackson as Jules in Pulp Fiction

Make a beeline over to Liberty and connect to your joy. Seriously if you are looking for eats.. vector to max opportunity for success.

Liberty Market has the best tasting ground beef in the state - bar none. I'm a connoisseur. Check the midsection baby. Yeah!... that's right! I know what Imma talkin' 'bout.

I just love this place. They have specials every week. And each week they tempt me with something creative, new, and exploding with flavor Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, it's all good. And it's all memorable.

Their scones and other pastries are stellar. The order process exploits the seemly boundless display of tasty treats. It's just unfair that my stomach has such limited capacity.

This is a place you come with family, with friends, with that date you want to imbue with that down-to-earth understanding of you. It's just so homey and pleasant. Much of that is due to the AAA+ staff friendliness and service attitude.

Tell me you are not sold on just the mention of Apricot Glazed Chicken alone... and it comes with whipped sweet potatoes. Yowza!
Other awesomeness includes:
-Biscuits and Gravy
-Smothered Breakfast Burrito - 
-The specialty pancakes. Oh my... oh my dear lord.
-The Tower Burger - life changing tastiness
-New York Strip Steak Sandwich... pretzel bun my homies
-Meatball sandwich
-Spaghetti with meatballs
-Flatiron Steak - We're talkin' Mr. Pibb marinade, chimichurri sauce, roasted garlic smashed potato
-There is so much more. Kills me to stop listing. Kills me I'm not there now.

Just head on over and be happy."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Had the hot chocolate, which is made with a syrup made on the premises. It was delicious.   The chilaquiles had the right amount of spice. 

We sat at the bar and enjoyed talking with the barista. 

We happened upon this restaurant looking for the place next door. So glad we opted to change our plans.   We will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch or dinner this place is a winner!

The food is fantastic here. I have many items on the menu, but my standard go to is the simple egg salad sandwich. Most places screw this simple item up, but Liberty Market has a lock on the best in the west in my opinion. I usually save room for desert and get a killer slice of the red velvet cake and a latte in a bowl, yes you read that right, in a bowl.

The staff always goes above and beyond and run a smooth operation. There is usually a line so be prepared for that, but it is usually a quick turn around."}
{"text":"Went to Liberty Market after a morning of hiking/driving for some yummy breakfast as I heard it was delicious! My cousin and I stood in line for some time while the party in front of us ordered their meals. Julie was sweet enough to get our orders in right before breakfast was ending. While eating our delicious food my cousin and I noticed Julie walking around with a smile on her face helping customers. All the employees we came across were friendly and had a smile on their faces! Will be back! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Liberty Market for breakfast.  My husband and I  split the breakfast quesadilla, which makes the portion perfect for us.  The salsa is tasty.  The potatoes are a little heavy on the onions, but I don't like onions at all.  So, the onion thing is more a personal problem than Liberty's recipe because my daughter LOVES the potatoes.  We have only had lunch/dinner items a time or two.  I remember the burger being pretty tasty and again, we something we were able to split. 

The atmosphere is nice and fits the quaint area of old town Gilbert.  The outside seating is very pleasant.  This is going to sound weird, but go to the bathroom, even if you don't have to actually \"go\"."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Got the liberty pasta bowl. Meatballs were really good! Loved the two pieces
of toast that came with it to soak up that flavorful marinara sauce. Will be back for this again."}
{"text":"Loving this afternoon delight!  Amazing Italian Grinder with pasta salad, topped off with blueberry cheesecake.  We will be back soon for breakfast."}
{"text":"I would come here for breakfast and the pastries. So delicious and great price for the food. But that is not the same for their dinner menu. Small portions and pricy food."}
{"text":"Ok food at egregious prices. Would recommend if you have a business meeting and need an environment that has a lot going on."}
{"text":"Any chance I have to make it to Liberty Market with friends I will! I love this place! They make a fantastic cup of coffee and amazing panini sandwiches. I particularly like the array of vegetarian options since I don't eat meat. As a garlic lover I can't get enough of their garlic hummus! Oh yea, and yes the bathrooms are indeed very cool. :)"}
{"text":"Okay let me just say my husband and I must be the only people living in Gilbert who have not been here until today we went for lunch and the food and the people and the owners were amazing we will definitely continue to go for breakfast lunch and dinner thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Great place for a meal, beer, or coffee.  They really are able to make it all work, one of my favorite places in the valley, and I'm willing to make the drive from Tempe just to get their espresso which is one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  Staff is so much fun, food is fresh and the ingredients are top notch."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The food is a bit pricey, but top-notch quality! I have been twice and had a great experience both times. Lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and always have a great experience. The food is high quality and fresh. I always get a pressed sandwich of some sort. The pizza is great too. And we always have to get a bread pudding with fresh whipped cream. Delicious!

And you absolutely must get an espresso drink here. Joe Johnston (the owner) brought the espresso machine over from Italy and OMG the espresso is fantastic! The cortadito is my personal favorite.

I've always had great service here as well. My only gripe is how you have to wait in line cafeteria style to place your order. Expect to wait a really long time if you go during lunch rush."}
{"text":"We have visited Liberty Market on about 4 previous occasions.  This time I had the Blueberry Pancakes and they were honestly the best I have ever had in my 70 plus adult years.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place was found purely out of need to find food before my friend and I ran to the barn for the evening. Working horses on an empty stomach is not a brilliant idea. Our respective beaus joined us and Yelp reviews dictated that the best place to go in the Gilbert area was Liberty Market.

The food was GREAT. 5 stars on that. 

The entire atmosphere is VERY reminiscent of Panera, but more upscale and with home made treats versus corporate soup mixes etc.

The service? Lacking if quantity. They have way too many customers for the amount of food runners they hired and are spread thin at no fault of their VERY competent staff. Had to pull a star for that.

Definitely going back and definitely planning to enjoy this more!"}
{"text":"The service was top notch.  Very friendly.  I ordered the white pizza and it was fabulous.  Look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a small date or large groups, Liberty Market will always be one of the greatest Gilbert staples. I've been here for all different meals, and none have disappointed.

My personal favorite is the Beet Salad, and I always add Grilled Salmon. Their White Pizza is also delicious, and their Apricot Chicken is another favorite! They also have plenty of vegetable side options.

For dessert, you must try their chocolate cake! It's well known in the area for being divine. And I've heard they make the best Cortada this side of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at Liberty Market and absolutely enjoyed my experience. The food is out of this world fantastic. Everything is fresh and homemade. 

The service (from everyone!) is unbelievably friendly. Everyone works together as a team and it helps food service run very smoothly. 

I love supporting local restaurants that serve locally sourced, fresh food. Will return often!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time I absolutely love it everything on the menu is fantastic such a funky vibe, rustic, great coffee bar in the back. The bathrooms are my favorite part I know that sounds weird but each one is different, different music, different vibe different theme so creative"}
{"text":"I have been to Liberty Market for breakfast and a couple times for lunch and have always loved their food.  We finally went for dinner and it was the best meal we've had in a long time!  Everything is made fresh here, including all the desserts.  They also have the best gluten free bun and they have been regularly putting out a gluten free or vegan dessert.  They have great weekly specials and this is a great restaurant anytime!!"}
{"text":"First time in Gilbert and wanted to try this restaurant based on Check Please. Nice concept, you get on the line while reading the menu. In the meantime the hostess finds you a table while you order and pay for your food. Nice variety on the menu and specials of the day. Desserts fabulous, \" the salt river bar.\""}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was good. The oatmeal cookie pie can feed 4 to 5 people haha. Its very rich and delish. I will come back!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Liberty Market.... They are one classy establishment! They go above and beyond to help meet your needs when you need it most. We have a wheelchair user in our family and were running short on time that night. Trying to find a table and get dinner ordered is sometimes tricky for us. It was the night of my birthday which was the day before Valentine's Day, so it was very crowded. They helped meet every need we had that night to help us make our next engagement on time, following our dinner. Thank you, thank you for that! Thank you for a friendly welcome and the service you always offer and provide. There's nothing like good hometown local establishments. Its always a wonderful experience at Liberty! You truly care so much about your customers and it is so appreciated!"}
{"text":"We keep coming back, and it keeps proving why this is a 5 star restaurant.   Joe Johnston it seems, knows how to run a place."}
{"text":"i dislike the entire phoenix metro in general, but this place makes me forget that for a little while. good vegan options, great service, in a beautiful space, and i can have a whole french press pot of coffee to myself if i wish. add a mimosa and the vegan breakfast burrito and you're in business."}
{"text":"Thank you Liberty!!!!!  My son has major diet restrictions right now (dairy, corn & wheat) and your staff went out of their way to ensure that all of the items we wanted to order for him were safe.  I really appreciate the attention to detail and care that you all showed - realizing that it is a precarious situation with food allergies, I very much want to thank you for your attention to detail and making us feel welcome and cared for - instead of the typical \"I don't know\" answer - ALL of your staff made sure to find out the  answer to our ingredient questions. AND on top of that - our meal was FANTASTIC as well!  Thank you again for sharing your knowledge and care for my family.  We will definitely return with friends another day soon!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place so many times and decided to give it a try.  Didn't care so much for the waiting in line gig.  Perhaps it's so busy and the place is small they have to resort to that, not a huge deal.  Had the \"Best Chicken\" sandwich, and it waas perhaps the best chicken sandwich I've had...even the kettle chips are awesome.  Would love to go back and try some more stuff."}
{"text":"We have always loved this place, but it is near and dear to our heart today. My in-laws ordered breakfast to go for my daughter who had celiacs. We were all eating at Lo Lo's and there was nothing for her to eat. My mother-in-law forgot the fruit she ordered, and one of their sweet servers brought it all the way down to where we were eating breakfast! He had heard her say that they were taking it down to Lo Lo's and he took it upon himself to bring it to us! That's customer service! He was so sweet:) I wish I caught his name... Tall, young, and so nice. Thanks for thinking of our sweet daughter.  We will obviously be back to Liberty any chance we get:) their gluten sensitivity is unlike any we've seen and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place as I had heard rave reviews. In addition they have a vegetarian tofu scramble option which many places don't offer. 

It was very loud and you have to order food at the counter then the runners bring it to the table. So the first thing that went wrong was they got my order wrong. I ordered the tofu scramble with extra veggies but they brought a veggie omelet. They redid it correctly but the tofu, while good flavor, was drowning in oil. We had waited over 30 minutes so I didn't want to re-do it again. 
I was with a friend who had been there several times for lunch and dinner but never breakfast. She too said her food was very oily/greasy and was disappointed compared to her previous experiences.

I would likely try again, given the great reviews I read, but not rushing back. Three stars is a bit generous and I would have given 2.5 stars if able."}
{"text":"While the décor was impressive I found that the food was only moderate to poor in quality. We ordered their tower burger and chicken sandwich for an early lunch. While my dining partner enjoyed his chicken sandwich the baked fries which seemed like a very nice healthy alternative were a huge disappointment (see picture below). The choice of beverages was fine in the restaurant appeared clean but considering the high prices both the burger and the sides were a bit of a disappointment. The burger was surprisingly underseasoned and though it was cooked properly it certainly did not justify the $12 cost."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  A step away from typical even when you order something as simple as grilled cheese.

Busy, but not so busy you wait an hour or anything crazy.

Definitely a local favorite."}
{"text":"Give me Liberty or give me.... well, you get the idea. Long overdue review. I think the Liberty Market is the jewel of downtown Gilbert. It's casual and almost always hopping. Great wait staff and service every time we've been there. Being a creature of habit, I probably have ordered the Liberty Pasta Bowl half the time I've ate there, but don't miss out on the pizza. I think it rivals Le Grande Orange pizza if you've ever had one there. I like the sausage, the wife likes the Margherita. 
The thing that makes this place stand out among the myriad of dining choices in downtown Gilbert is the variety. All the other restaurants have a certain niche, whether tacos, chicken, pizza, burgers and soon to be mexican and breakfast. The Liberty does most of them and does them very well. When guests are in town, the Liberty Market is a perfect choice. When we want variety, the Liberty Market has no competition. When we want a sure thing, it's the Liberty Market."}
{"text":"The wait is usually a bit lengthy so get here early enough on the weekends! The lox and bagel is my 'go to' breakfast item and it never disappoints. All of the coffee choices are great but I always end up getting the cortado. My husband enjoys the chilaquiles because who doesn't want Mexican food for breakfast! :)"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant.  They have brick oven pizzas that are very good.  I have been here several times and would recommend the dessert."}
{"text":"Went there twice because all these people eating there but so crowded, could not get in! But had time to look at menue but was not impressed at all! The place is set up like a DMV and the ambience is like a dmv!! PASS!!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a classic and creative American restaurant that lies in the heart of downtown Gilbert. This staple food site perfectly represents the epitome of Gilbert's past, present, and future and actually used to serve as the town's local grocery. 
For my 21st birthday, I decided to dine in with a friend. Make sure to show off your ID when it is your birthday, so they take $10 off of your bill. I would definitely take that over the cliched complementary dessert and embarrassing, out-of-tune round of \"Happy Birthday.\" 
I ordered the Liberty Pasta Bowl, my favorite dish on the menu, and a mojito, while my friend got the Apricot Glazed Chicken. The pasta dish comes with a plentiful amount of noodles topped with a light, sweet tomato sauce, hefty beef meatballs, and two half-slices of garlic bread. It was perfectly seasoned and filled me up pretty easily. The glazed chicken with sweet potatoes and veggies seemed a bit pricey, at $16 on the menu, for the amount of food received. However, my friend said it was still very delicious.
Even though the food at Liberty Market is pretty noteworthy, the atmosphere and environment is definitely the highlight of the restaurant. The open, artisanal kitchen, the E61 espresso bar in the window corner, and the unique individually decorated restrooms really bring the place to life. The amount of love and care given to this restaurant really shows. Classy yet family-friendly, modern yet historic, casual yet intimate. It's the perfect harmony between the old and the new.

P.S. I really enjoyed that you pay at the counter and then find a seat. It really speeds up the dining process and makes waiting for checks a thing of the past."}
{"text":"Can I just tell you how much I love Liberty Market?!?!?!  My favorite, favorite, favorite thing there is the Caprese Pasta Salad...to die for!  They also make a pretty darn good Egg Salad Sandwich, oh and let's not forget those Raspberry Scones with the cream to dip them in!
The staff has always been very nice and helpful.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great clean, open, exhibitionist kitchen. Beautiful red brick nostalgia meets modern industrial. Phenomenal service and attention.  LGO eat your heart out. 

Pro's: 
-service
-pizza crust
-fresh fruitful use of ingredients
-price...dinner, dessert, drinks = $35.  

Con's: 
-Italian soda was all ice, couldn't taste syrup. Perhaps I was brought wrong drink?"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late lunch (around 2) on a Saturday and the place was still packed!! This downtown Gilbert area is jumping on Saturdays...probably helped along by the huge downtown farmers market nearby. 
We ordered at the counter and then sat at the designated spot (a server gives you a number and then places that number on a table which makes for easier seating and no one can 'save' tables) We ordered sandwiches...delish! Mine was the Maiden Lane (turkey and brie) and I ordered it pressed. My side was the sweet potato salad...which was amazing too. My friend's sandwich (Egg salad) was not quite as good and her side (regular potato salad) was good, but not as yummy as mine! 
The only downside was the noise level..lots of families, kids etc. But the food was great and we shall return...maybe for dinner next time. And I HAVE to try something from their baked goods display. WOW, that pecan roll looked fabulous!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and menu are trendy. The service is efficient but not so friendly. The food is actually quite good. And I like that they offer a free birthday meal! Busy place for a reason."}
{"text":"Food, and atmosphere are great! You do have to wait in Line to order  for awhile though."}
{"text":"An all time favorite restaurant of mine.

Between the food, staff, vibes, and location...this place is as good as it gets. The price is probably what will get most people, because its so easily dangerous to try more and more food. Everything they have has literally been great. The chef's pizza is always a favorite of mine. And the chef is a super nice humble dude, might I add?

If you like beer, try their Golden Monkey. Not many people have it on draft, and I find it a luxury that I get to drink that here! Deserts are obviously to die for. The bread pudding (flaver changes weekly I think?) is a fav. I will always come back again and again to this place. I and many friends have yet to try ANYTHING that is not completely satisfying."}
{"text":"I figured out why you wait in a long line to eat here . Its part of a numbers game to turn tables over in a systematic way. No waiters and 50 people just cant walk in the door at rush hour and plug up all the tables! It forces a smooth turn over of tables. it took us about 20 minutes to order last night and the line was to the back door. 
I had the tower burger which was very good....9.95 and it came with potato chips.
A very thick burger patty!
The pineapple chutney it came with was great on my chips!
Dont let it go to waste.
All of the ingredients looked very fresh....i will go back.

WARNING...... FROM NOV- APRIL.....DO NOT THINK YOU ARE JUST GOING TO WALK IN AND ORDER AROUND DINNER TIME ON ANY DAY.
OUR LINE WAS 25 ft long at 6pm on wed
SNOWBIRD ALERT!!! Snowbird alert !!!! BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Liberty Market on several different occasions now and it is definitely a place you need to visit if you are in the East Valley. 

The location is excellent, on a street corner in downtown Gilbert directly across from Postino's and Joyride. Built out of an actual Market, there are still vintage shopping carts and other items adorning the decor. The size, feel, and layout make it nice for couples, families, or other large groups. Outdoor seating is nice but limited, and you may find yourself in the sun depending on where you sit.

The counter ordering process is novel, but more and more places are adopting this method. Often the lines can be long, especially for some dinners and Sunday brunch, but there are usually plenty of staff to keep the process moving. Even at it's longest I don't think I've waited more than 20 minutes or so to order and sit down. Plus the time passes pretty quickly because the line runs next to the open kitchen, allowing you to look at all the prep work going on and to admire the wood-fired pizza oven.

As for food, I have yet to be disappointed by my selections. I have mostly gone to Liberty Market for brunch. The seasonal pancake is always a nice option, with the most recent one being an orange pancake with a vanilla drizzle. It was light and not overly sweet, just good hints of orange with only as much vanilla syrup as you need (even though you might want more). I personally think the best  selection on the breakfast/brunch menu is the Smothered Breakfast Burrito. They have a grilled chicken or Schreiner's chorizo option for the protein and both are good (although I usually opt for the chorizo). Tomatillo or chile pequin salsas on top, yum yum! It's definitely a large item, so plan on being full or sharing with your dining companions. You can also order single glasses or large carafes of mimosas or sangria. Both are good ways to start a relaxing weekend.

On top of all of this they also have a very nice coffee bar that can be accessed separately from the food if you are just stopping in for your caffeine fix. The regular coffee is certainly good, but if you really want a good coffee experience go for the Cafe Au Lait or the \"Ca Phe\" which is a take on Vietnamese iced coffee. 

Downtown Gilbert is amassing a very nice selection of dining establishments, especially with the Upward Projects restaurants anchoring the scene. But for my money, I almost always find myself at Liberty Market when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One star for great and friendly service.

Another star for their coffee and pancakes. 

A third star for design and ambience.

The food itself was rather basic and flavorless. I got the chilaquiles which were highly recommended, and they tasted like they were made with tomato puree (how my mom used to make them for me when I was 6 and couldn't handle spices yet.) My mom and sister got the American classic, and again rather flavorless, at least for my mom. 

My sister actually is in love with the whole establishment and she is the reason why we came, since she can't get enough! She ordered an iced coffee, which she thought was \"amazeballs\" (her words), but I tried it and it tasted like watered down milk. On the other hand, their Cubano espresso was excellent and I would come back to try more of their coffee bar and desserts."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  We take all out of town guests here because it is our favorite!!! Love bfast, lunch and dinner menus! The zucchini bread- yum! Mocha bowl-yum!!! The egg salad sandwich- yum! We have tried a lot things on the menu and have enjoyed them all!!!    The Liberty bowl is perfect as well!"}
{"text":"Mmmm...rice pudding!! Trust me...it's INCREDIBLE. No really, TRUST ME!!

So, obviously (well, obviously), we came here for dessert...and oh wow. So good. The line was a little long...and let me tell you it got even longer after we got in it. but it was worth every second of the wait. Aside from the rice pudding, we also had the bread pudding, which was really great as well. 

I am so looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix to try some of the delicious looking pizza. Definitely a cool hangout in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Sandwich burger breakfast and yummy baked goods.

Service is fantastic. Seriously everyone is so friendly and helpful. Also very cheerful as well :). Patio is nice when it's cooler .  

Great pastrie selection and one of the guy who brought yummy macaron said \" here's your camaroons!\" Hahha it was so cute :p

Latte has good strong flavor will be returning a lot :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! We come here mainly during breakfast. 
I get the simple breakfast sandwich and love it! Tons of bacon, melted cheese, scrambled eggs all in between a ciabatta bun! It's kinda random to me that it's served with a little salad in the side but the salad compliments it well and is tasty! 
The breakfast quesadilla is yummy too!"}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant/coffee bar you take somebody whom you want to impress. Liberty Market is modern, stylish, and has excellent food and service to back up the impressive atmosphere. I have in the past driven 30 minutes from my house just to have an iced carmel latte made by these guys. It's just that good. The menu is also inventive and I would highly recommend getting the appetizer pizza to start with hummus on the side. All of the meals are great, and therefore I can't recommend anything above the rest. It's all so good! Be sure to check out the restrooms before you leave, too. Go inside every stall (they are co ed) and be amazed! Four solid stars from this girl!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chef's pizza special and the carrot cake.  I didn't enjoy the fact it would add 5 inches to my waistline, oh well I give them a star back for that one.   My other half had the grilled cheese sandwich, which she didn't care for.  I went back to the 80s and order a screwdriver at the bar forgot how good they where, and that later on they come with a headache.  Enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The white pizza is amazing!  Also had the cuban sandwich once and it was outstanding.  Love the beet salad too.  I could go on.  Everything we have tried has been very, very good."}
{"text":"Wow... what a surprise Liberty Market is. I'd lived in the east valley for about 3 years before ever setting foot in Liberty Market. It honestly doesn't look much different from the outside than all of the other places I've never set foot in inside downtown Gilbert (although that's probably MY problem, not theirs). But, with help from a lot of friends who swear by Liberty Market (and seeing them be so interactive on social media sites, like twitter), I have now been there multiple times. Their food is amazing, I have yet to be disappointed by anything they have served. 

Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich, FTW :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not a big breakfast person, but the lemon ricotta pancakes and breakfast sandwich and liberty market make me look forward to Saturday breakfast all week.

I've only ever been to liberty for breakfast but I based on that I can only imagine that every other meal here is amazing as well.

Definitely don't pass this place up, it's an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same people as Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's BBQ, I believe. This powerhouse restaurant group can do no wrong in my eyes. Probably my last choice out of the restaurants owned by this group just because I love the others so much, but I still love this place."}
{"text":"Most menu items are exceptional while a few are more average.  Pizza, breakfast plates, salads and coffee bar are exceptional.  I've found many of the baked goods to be less moist than I like, such as the cinnamon rolls, bread pudding, and cakes.  Once you find your favorites though, you'll have plenty of reason to come back again and again.

Liberty Market offers a lot more than quality dishes though.  The atmosphere is unique and inviting.  It's a cool meet up place for groups, whether that be family, friends or colleagues.   Additionally, the service is always excellent.  It's a very tightly run operation in many ways, which makes it a 5 for me.  It has really enhanced the look and value of the Heritage District in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Me likey. Call me cheap (hey, we are on a budget)(isn't everyone?). But I like the walk-up counter (ala Pei Wei) that has good food and a good environment. This has all of those. Creativity and quality oozes from all of Joe's spots. The menu is constantly changing. The environment is relaxing. And the coffee is taken very seriously. :) Check out each of the different themed bathrooms. 

My wife and I usually split a salad and either a pizza or even a sloppy joe. Then coffee and dessert. If you like bbq, that's right across the street at Joe's BBQ. This is one of our fav date spots."}
{"text":"lord knows i don't find myself in gilbert often, but if you do, it'd be criminal not to stop here. what a lovely, lovely place. i stopped with a slew of cohorts and was charmed by the decor, the menu and the service, which were - funky but clean, short but comprehensive and attentive & personable without being overbearing. 

though my friends were just going for coffee, i went for dinner and chose the smoked salmon place and the glazed carrots. both were delicious, presented well, etc. 

the coffee is the real star- we were amused by the \"bowl\" options and had been warned ahead of time. Ahead of time we'd been advised to \"go cordadito\" on the coffee.  excellent move. i wasn't overwhelmed with it, but my friends were and the presentation alone is worthwhile. 

this is a lovely place to pop into, at reasonable prices and staff that really goes out of their way."}
{"text":"Not too shabby Gilbert! 

We're in town for a friend's wedding and Mrs. G grew in in Gilbert. Now, when looking around Gilbert, it's full of Mcmansions and new development. However, wander into old town Gilbert and boom, they have some nice restaurants that have developed quite a following. Liberty Market's one of those places.

We ordered the Sicilian Scramble and the Breakfast Quesadilla. The scramble was scrumptious, good amount of Chorizo, and lots of flavor. Coupled with some breakfast potatoes and a biscuit and it was plenty of food. Mrs. G had the Q and it was..massive. Like a huge portion. While tasty, I thought it was excessive with no sides.

I also love that they had Vietnamese Coffee. Not something I expected out of an American joint.

Overall, a nice spot for breakfast in a town short of quality restaurants."}
{"text":"After wandering into Liberty Market on a Saturday while looking for a place to have brunch, I decided I may never leave.  Then I came back for lunch a week later, and decided to never leave again.  Having frequented Liberty Market now probably, ohhh...10+ times - always on weekends and always for breakfast/lunch, I'm dubbing it my go-to weekend meal.  I'm not normally a breakfast person, but this place has changed my mind many times over, especially when it comes to flavor, plus they've got something for everyone.  

There is almost always a constant line that can easily be 15-30 people deep at any given time, but it moves steadily and you never really feel like you're waiting and there's always a seat ready for you by the time you order.  Depending on when you walk in, menus are available for breakfast, lunch or dinner (or both breakfast and lunch if you come in on the weekend between 10am and 1pm) and you can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait to shuffle up to the register to order.  As you amble through the line, you snake along a tall cooler full of beverages from cans of limonata and bottles of exotic juices and sodas to cans and bottles of craft beer (including some local).  Further along the line you'll pass the pizza making station, where you can watch the cooks toss dough and unique toppings around before gently thrusting a fresh-made pizza into the brick oven (you could even watch it bake if you aren't in a rush...or hungry).  Right after the pizzas, the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside.  Just before you can take a look, someone will come up to you and give you a number while pointing out your table for you.  Then you can admire the caprese pasta salad, roasted sweet potato salad, corn-tomato-and-bean salad, hummus, fresh fruit and vegetables of the day, zebra brownies, carrot cake, bread pudding, red velvet cake, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and a cupcake of the day.  When you finally get to the register to order, food is the first thing on your mind and you can't wait to try everything.

Also, if you're looking for some caffeine...order the cortadito.  Just do it.

I could go on and on, but basically, the food is delicious and the wait times are manageable (the food arrives within 10-15 minutes after you sit down, if that).  It's not too fancy and it's definitely not plain, and yet it still avoids being pretentious while staying in the \"just right\" zone.  I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's accurate.  

Quick tip: they do not have a mist system outside, so they don't normally sit people on the patio in the summer, but it's well-shaded, so if you have a dog with you or just want to be away from everyone inside, they will sit you out there, you just have to ask."}

I dropped by here for lunch before flying out of PHX since I saw the great Yelp reviews. I got lucky and found a parking spot right outside on the street. Place is set up so that you order from the cashier, grab a seat, and they bring the food out to you shortly after.

1. Best Chicken Sandwich, 9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?userid=2fN8mN7uUjOw-QqtcgYqXQ
(grilled breast, monterey jack, spicy avocado spread, chipotle
vinaigrette, tomato, red onion, shredded iceberg,kettle chips)
It was okay. Not the \"best chicken sandwich\" I've ever had by a long shot. Okay at best.

2. Roasted Sweet Potato Salad, 2 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?userid=2fN8mN7uUjOw-QqtcgYqXQ
Mediocre. Roasted sweet potato, nuts, and some cranberries. Tasted all right, but I wouldn't eat more than a side of this at once.

3. Chocolate chip banana bread, 3 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=4nYEVmYIphCI0JfnUr9kqg
Not bad. Tastes just like how you'd expect it to taste. Chocolate glaze was a tad bit sweet though, but other than that, I ate the entire slice.

Oh, and their restrooms are awesome. M for men, MW for men and women. Music playing inside, and clean trendy sinks outside."}
{"text":"The sticky bun is where its at!  Delicious coffee drinks. The  sandwiches are good too. Pressed of course. Staff is always very nice. Lines can get very long during lunch and on weekends but usually move fast. Great place!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so many great things about the restaurant.  It didn't live up to the hype.  I thought everything was \"good\" but not memorable."}
{"text":"I definitely have to return and try the food. We stopped here and enjoyed some coffee. I had a cafe latte and added the Chai shot. It came out good but what made me glad was the fact the barista did his effort to gave us good presentation in the cortado and mine. 

Next time...food!!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high after I'd heard so many good things about this place because I can't say I was blown away.

The boyfriend and I are loyal fans of the Farmhouse which is right next door. But we'd been curious about their neighbor for a while so we finally decided to check out Liberty Market. It was a Sunday and I think there was a show at the Hale Theatre because the place was packed. We stood in line for quite a while. 

I ordered the demi-breakfast - eggs, biscuit and bacon and the boyfriend ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. We also ordered a slice of chocolate chip banana bread and a slice of red velvet cake to go because that's just how we roll.

I thought the banana bread was pretty good, boyfriend thought it was too dry. My demi-breakfast was okay but my biscuit was too powdery, like they didn't mix the dough well enough. There was actually a clump of flour in part of it. Considering how amazing the biscuits are at the Farmhouse next door I was disappointed. Boyfriend was not impressed with the quesadilla either.

Later that afternoon we decided to try out the red velvet cake. Like the breakfast, it was just okay. Nothing I would crave or make the trip across town for.

Overall, I like Joe's other places (Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill) much better. Although I will say the staff was very nice and I liked the atmosphere. Maybe their lunch is good? But for breakfast in Gilbert, I'll stick with the Farmhouse from now on."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found a place like this on the east side. It kinda reminds me of LGO but more accessible and spacious, I have found parking close by every time. I'm a sucker for downtown areas and rebuilt old buildings that are also well designed (the bathrooms are a must-see) and I love all the natural lighting from the big windows. It's been a little too chilly to sit on the patio, but it's tucked away from the road a bit, so I bet you'll find me there come springtime. 

I keep coming back for the latte bowl. It's fantastic and stays hot for like an hour. We had a pizza last week which was really good, but yesterday ordered the breakfast quesadilla and although it was humongous (enough for two), it was kinda greasy on the inside. Everything else I have had has been really good though. 

I am totally looking forward to the Espresso 101 and 102 classes I keep hearing about. I also want to try their other restaurant \"Joes BBQ\" across the street. I've heard good things about that place too."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a great place! It's fun to hang out and love going with a group of friends. I really don't like the bathrooms, I am still traditional and wouldn't mind having separate bathrooms. I think it is a little pricy. However, the food is good, drinks are great, and it's a fun atmosphere. 

Saturday mornings are packed, which is kind of annoying."}
{"text":"3.5 really.  This place has a neat vibe and atmosphere.  But every time I have been, the food is just okay and it is way overpriced for very small portions.  A bowl of soup shouldn't be $7.5 and tiny coffees shouldn't be $4.  But a nice modern feel.  Very casual.  Not a sit down table service place."}
{"text":"Passed this place many times over the years and I decided to bring some of my out of town guests to try.  We were immediately greeted by a server/waiter, who was kind enough to explain the process.  While we were looking at their cold deli counter, there was a lady prepping some food and offered us samples.  Never seen or heard of Sweet Potato salad and it was the bomb.  We order several sandwiches and sides and everything was flavorful.  Everyone here is so friendly and the place offers indoor or patio seating and the décor is nice and tables are kept clean.  I will definitely come back to try their breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"How do you start off a review when you're simply flabbergasted? Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review. 
      I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different. 
      Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a \"market\" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night. 
      Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing \"Liberty Ale\" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients. 
      We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best."}
{"text":"Love the history behind this place, average food from my couple times here can't seem to find a meal that just knocks me off my feet. It is pricey for what it is too. Otherwise nice hip place to get some lunch and walk around."}
{"text":"Toddy is the best I have had in Phoenix. Have had several food options and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Red Velvet Cake. They also have special burgers all the time. The atmosphere is really unique and I always leave full."}
{"text":"I had the Best Chicken sandwich and it was very good.  I also ordered the sweet potato salad and it was wonderful.  The atmosphere was interesting, bustling and fun.  I love the feeling of the old buildings in town and I will return."}
{"text":"Liberty is life. Super cool place with a really varied menu that you can easily develop 4-5 favorites on. 
Great alcohol pairing options and pizzas/FBs are good. 
Another simple idea but the way you pay and eat is genius and creates a huge added feeling of leisure."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is one of our favorite spots. The flat iron steak is to DIE for. I rarely manage to choose something else because I enjoy it so much. Mom and dad love the salmon. The bread pudding is an awesome treat and enough to share. Breakfast was delicious, as well, but we go more often for dinner. They have a really interesting coffee selection, with a lot of things I've never heard of but would like to try. Over all, a place not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong with anything you order here. The line can get long during peak times, but don't stray because it goes very fast and is worth the wait. They recently changed their iced tea section and it is sooooo much better now. The pressed farmer sandwich is outstanding as a vegetarian option, and the burger of the week always packs a ton of flavor and variety. 
If you like coffee, try the cortadito. It is simply delicious and the presentation makes you feel like you are at a quaint Cuban cafe. 

The desserts are to die for, especially the huge cinnamon rolls. The rice pudding is technically considered a \"side dish\" but it could definitely double as a dessert. 

Make a trip to the bathroom to see the unique decor. One bathroom even has recipes written all over the walls in the most tasteful way you could imagine. I am a detail oriented person and Liberty market has so many quirky details that I love discovering! 

The parking can be a pain sometimes with all of the recent development in downtown Gilbert, but there is a new garage going up and a little stroll along the historic area isn't so bad. 

I take all our out of town guests here to eat, you should too!"}
{"text":"I love finding great local places for breakfast. It's my favorite type of food and I can eat it anytime of day. 

My husband and I were headed to the Gilbert Farmer's Market and needed food. We walked in, grabbed a menu and the minute I saw Buttermilk Pancakes with Chopped Bacon I was sold. There is seating inside and outside; when they're busy they go through the line and assign you a table number based on the size of your group. This makes things move smoothly unless you're rude and decide that your assigned table isn't good enough for you. Yes, people really do that.

There are several things that make these pancakes amazing. When they're on the griddle they sprinkle cooked, chopped bacon on the wet side, flip it and serve. It's genius. Then they put a wrapped butter pad on each pancake. This is awesome, because the butter starts to melt. There is nothing worse than rock hard, cold butter that tears apart your pancakes as you try to spread it. It comes with a side of syrup that is good, but doesn't overpower the flavor of the pancake itself. 

They carry Revolution Tea which makes my hubby very happy. Their French Press of Stump Town Coffee is very tasty, but their latte tasted way too burnt and just wasn't enjoyable. 

At some point, I will venture out and try one of their amazing burgers or pizzas which all look amazing. But once you have the bacon pancakes, it's hard to pick something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Great concept, cool location, okay food.
I got the veggie sandwich (that I loved!!!), but tried my friends' sandwiches (sloppy joe, chicken sandwich, and a ham/turkey sandwich) that all left a little something to be desired.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it just doesn't knock your socks off.  I'd go here again to try their breakfast and coffee bar.  Their cinnamon rolls were calling my name from the case too...."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count at this point. Wish it was not in Gilbert. Not a huge fan of the ordering style, but I dig the food so much I can deal with standing in the long line. I'll just list all my favorites starting with breakfast. The Demi Breakfast is my go-to with the turkey maple sausage. So few places offer turkey sausage for us pork-free folks so this gets them high marks. And it's not some crappy wimpy frozen turkey sausage, it's a big fat juicy one. Liberty breakfast potatoes - also delish. 

Lunch and dinner. Hollywood Cobb salad (sans bacon) is my most often ordered. Always fresh and filling. The \"starter pizza\" which is just seasoned bread with cheese is SO GOOD. Especially with a side of hummus. I sometimes opt for the Sicilian slice special, when it happens to be a meat-free variety. It comes with a nice salad that has diced zucchini and squash.  The regular wood fired pizzas are great too, I'm into the margherita.

Desserts. The case is massive, everything looks tempting. I have had occasion to try most of them and here is my take. Banana chocolate chip cake - yes. Zucchini bread with the mile of cream cheese frosting - no. Salt River bar - yes. Zebra brownie - no. Any of the cupcakes on special - yes! They did a Samoa one a while back that was rockin.

Don't be scared by the line! Even on a Saturday night it moves fast enough. And food always comes out fast in my experience. Fun fact - if you go on your birthday (ID required) you get $10 off your meal if you dine-in, or a free dessert on take-out orders."}
{"text":"D*** straight \"methinks not\"! Talk about hype.  For 2 breakfasts (2 American standards, 2 sides of pancakes, an JO and coffee) I paid $30 that amounted to nothing I couldn't have made at home for $8, and my version would have tasted better.  What really irked me was that in order to get a pancake instead of a biscuit I had to buy it as a side, which was fine... until I found out that $3 doesn't get you a side of pancakes, it gets you one pancake about the size of my palm, that tastes like any other so its not as if they're super special.  Thank god at least the coffee was good."}
{"text":"This is a favorite of mine. I like that they offer weekly specials on burgers and a main entree. Keeps things interesting. The food is pretty consistent. I haven't had a bad meal here yet. The only drawback I have for not giving it 5 stars is that its a little on the pricy side. But you do get better quality food than a chain restaurant.  The coffee bar is great, open all day.  The staff are friendly and when not busy, happy to chat.  It can be very busy on weekends and mornings."}
{"text":"I will be back. Their pasta is too die for. I am a great judge of pasta, their pizza is not too shabby either. This place has almost every type of food. I think it's just difficult too drive and find parking, that's why I have only been here twice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast in all of the valley!! If you can squeeze your way at the coffee bar, you can skip the line. I usually rate my breakfast places by quality of coffee and Liberty is delicious for true coffee drinkers. My favorite is the veggie scramble and the pecan cinnamon roll. It's bigger than a dinner plate!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner you can't go wrong at The Liberty Market!!!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is, in my mind, a foundational piece to downtown Gilbert. It is more widely acknowledged for its role as a restaurant, however I am going to comment on its role as a coffee shop.

You don't have to come just for the food! Step up to the coffee counter and a barista will hook you up with the coffee drink of your choosing. They have a menu that goes beyond the traditional fast food coffee, so don't worry. I love to order the cortadito. It comes as two shot glasses of steamed milk (cream?) and espresso with raw sugar at the bottom. Stir it up with your little spoon (provided) and you've got a perfectly warm drink to sip on (and instagram, if you feel so inclined, idk). It's really got the \"muddy\" flavor of an espresso drink (not in a mad way), so if you're not really accustomed to that much coffee flavor, I would suggest ordering something else. Last time I went, I noticed they had a vietnamese iced coffee, which I ordered. It was definitely a lot sweeter than I was accustomed to (which I didn't love). Happenstance or not, I appreciate the option on their menu. 

Ordering coffee, you have the option to sit at their bar or high top table. However don't feel that just because you've only ordered coffee that you're being careened to the bar. You can still sit at the various tables and booths with the rest of the restaurant goers (because you're equally important).

I've noticed that the coffee bar also holds bottles of liquor. If this means that the option for an Irish coffee exists, I do not know (so if liberty market wants to comment, feel free...because I'm listening).

Apart from that, the restaurant is modernized and still cozy. It really picks up during meal times, which can make finding a table a hassle. I'd say still worth swinging by to experience. Also, the bathroom is very cool, each stall room with its own theme. It's truly about the small things in life...and I appreciate them. 

If you're not familiar with downtown Gilbert, parking now days is ample. There are various lots to park very close to liberty market and a nearby garage, all free."}
{"text":"Tasty food, long wait, confusing ordering, slightly overpriced and loud"}
{"text":"Had their white pizza with toasted pine nuts and it was truly amazing.  Great atmosphere however the style of service was a little confusing at first but overall i had a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  It is by far the hippest and best food in all of downtown Gilbert.  I would pick it over BBQ any day of the week.

Their bread pudding is to die for.  All their pizza and sandwiches are good.  Their pancakes rock!  I could eat here every day and never tire of their menu.

LOVE this place.  We just moved from NYC and have had a HARD time finding good food in the area.  This place beats them all :)"}
{"text":"In one word, Liberty Market is overrated.

The service is garbage (the little there is, anyway), and the food always takes so long to get. The food is alright. It's catered to white suburban families and the type of people who think Olive Garden is Italian and Tia Rosa's is good. But this is not fine dining  or remotely close by any means.
 
the food it ususally a hit or miss. I've had the white pizza which has some good flavors but is extremely unbalanced in flavor, and the amount of arugula that they give you is laughable. Arugula should not be a garnish for a white pizza. I've also had the Far East salad which is also terrible in flavor. It has fresh ingredients, but is missing so much. To be fair Liberty Market typically deals with those whose palates are fearful of rice wine vinegar, chili, salt, and honey. Some of the other food is good, like the Mac and cheese, but also, it's mac and cheese, what is there to mess up?? 

This place would not stand a chance anywhere besides Gilbert or Mesa.The food and service are just beyond subpar. Do yourself a favor and make the 3 minute walk to go across the street to Postino."}
{"text":"Loved it, great food good selection, goodmluck finding a seat!"}
{"text":"Hands down can not get enough! Atmosphere, food, employees, and location! one word BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Only been there a couple times, both times food was great, great service, great coffee too. Woot for free wifi!"}
{"text":"We went in for dinner and I thought it was ok, but not better than that.  The service staff was friendly and helpful, however when bringing me a bowl with salad, please don't have your thumb inside the bowl as you are carrying it.  I had the NY Steak sandwich.  The meat was good, but there was not very much of it hidden inside a large pretzel bun.  I also had the salad I mentioned before.  The greens seemed fresh.  The croutons were buried at the bottom of the salad bowl so they were soggy from the dressing that was added by the staff.

Based upon other reviews I read, it seems like more of a breakfast/lunch type of place.  I might go back and try it for breakfast at some point but for dinner I would probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A must not miss Gilbert gem, great for locals, snowbirds, and visitors. Line up order and table is always ready. Don't miss the coffee bar, best baristas in the valley. Incredible baked goods, sweet potato muffins and cinnamon rolls are a must. Wood fired pizzas, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Neat decor inside and outside seating.

Breakfast potatoes are great, onion pepper and cheesy goodness, most breakfast plates come with moist flaky homemade biscuits (awesome). For a heavy treat try the bread pudding French toast. Another signature favorite of ours is the Mac and cheese, we try and hit at around 11 when breakfast and lunch items (weekends) are available."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Gilbert. I'm particularly fond of their coffee. They have quality food as well. I'd like to see the menu rotated a little more often or slightly expanded."}
{"text":"My first time here. My friend heard about it and looked it up online. It sounded fun and the food sounded good. We enjoyed it very much. The service great the people are very friendly and pleasant. I recommend it very highly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype.  Unique setting in that you order and pay at the counter and then take a number to your table, a la Carls Jr.  However, the service was great and the food was excellent.  We had the flank steak and chicken sandwhich.  The steak was full of flavor and the chicken was tasty as well.  Definitely looking forward to going back and trying some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Another one of Joe's great places. Been coming here for over 3 years now and have yet to be disappointed in anything. Been to the community dinners too. If you have not it's a must. Differently should put the duck confit enchiladas on the menu PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"There isn't a bad thing that I could possibly say about Liberty Market. Liberty Market launches my taste buds into space because their food is out of this world good! The biscuits and gravy are a must try along with an Americano. They also offer foods that are gluten free as well as vegetarian options. Customer service gets an A as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant. Don't leave without trying the Liberty Potatoes!  Parking is not your friend here, so good luck with that. Also, go early because this place gets packed...fast."}
{"text":"Pizzas and burgers at this place are awesome. Been here half a dozen times and every time it's great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Thanks, Joe for saving Gilbert!

Great, casual place like a slimmed down Dish urban market (RIP).  The pizzas have awesome crusts and without the wait! (take that Bianco)  NIce place to stop by for a quick bite.  I hope they opne up a grill too."}
{"text":"I want to say this, I've left Phoenix and since moved. The owners of the liberty market wanted me to come back and they would buy me dinner or whatever would make me happy. They didn't do this to buy my review they did it to correct an error. As a owner of past company I respect the effort that they wanted to do this and I'm changing this to 4 stars for the effort alone. 

Yes people they do care about their customers."}
{"text":"Eh- it's fine.  I prefer this place for lunch over breakfast mainly due to the crazy long waits you'll experience on a weekend.  On my most recent visit it was about an hour from the time I got in line until I had my food in front of me.  That'd be fine if it was exceptional food but it's not.  It's just good.  

I like the coffee bar and the options that provides and the pastries are fascinatingly large if nothing else."}
{"text":"Amazing food, just loud and always packed. I would definitely recommend the food though! Yummy"}
{"text":"I love coming here at least once a week. For their breakfast chilaquiles, or huge chorizo quesadilla. So filling! Their pizzas are super yummy, they will have different kinds weekly. The apricot chicken is my favorite.  Not overly sweet. The veggies served are farm grown and delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Tuesday night around 9.  Our New York strip steak sandwich and Liberty pasta bowl were both tasty;
...but service not so much. 
We ordered at the register and seated ourselves (as is the custom at Liberty Market).  After food arrived, Mom realized that her pasta was served without Parmesan.  We asked a nearby server for some - she said she'd by right back with it - but was never to be seen again (the guy at the pizza oven was very helpful to give me some when I got up to ask him for it).
\"Servers\" in the dining room where we were seated were generally inattentive - -  make sure you get everything you need before whoever brings your food leaves the table. If you don't- I would suggest just going without it to save yourself the frustration of trying to get any \"after the food is served\" service. 
It was my first time here - - - so now that I understand how it all works I'd probably have a less disappointing second visit.  Maybe I'll return for the meatballs."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a great dining choice.  The menu is wide ranging.  My favorites are the Kale Salad, the olives and hummus, the Minestrone Soup (which comes with a dollop of pesto that makes it amazing) and most anything they serve as a chef special at dinner.  It is always a great place to take out of town guests because it has a unique vibe and is in the heart of a cute walk-able area in Gilbert.  The service is always friendly and welcoming and you will just feel happy dining there each time you go."}
{"text":"A solid local spot that generally lives up to the high expectations that we have for a \"Joe's\" dining experience. Multiple visits have not failed to please, though one could ask for more consistently-diced Liberty potatoes--seems like there are a few undercooked, crunchy cubes on every plate. Finally, either the kitchen needs a refresher on what caramelized onions are, or the menu needs updating to reflect what's being sent out--SAUTEED onions. I'll be happy either way, but help me keep my expectations in line with reality!"}
{"text":"It's one of the places to be seen in Gilbert. The downtown environment makes the place for good basic food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and they have some good food, the wait is a stickler some times but it is good.  I personally don't like the congestion of downtown gilbert and that is the only reason I took off a star, parking sucks!  otherwise a must go"}
{"text":"Everything we got was amazing . We ordered takeout. 
The tower burger was cooked perfectly. And love all the dressings that came with it. 
Qeuso dip was on point very good ! 

The soup we got was very good ! 
Well prepared . The kids Mac and cheese was amazing. 

My only issue was with the buffalo fingerlings I was not impressed . The fingerlings tasted undercooked . A bit disappointed there but everything else being great made up for it ! 

I definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I do like this place, and after having breakfast at The Farm House next door I now have a greater appreciation for Liberty Market."}
{"text":"Amazing cinnamon rolls, the freshest ingredients, delicious menu options. My family and I love the homemade taste of Liberty Market! We eat here often, and are regulars for grabbing giant cinnamon rolls to-go."}
{"text":"I yelp, therefore I am...  

I've been putting this Yelp review off for a while, and after dining there this evening I feel compelled to quit procrastinating and finally put pen to paper (so to speak).  

Liberty Market is one of my favorite local restaurants; every meal that I have ever ordered there has been exemplary.  The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and always extremely courteous.   I've spent more than a few evenings there at the pizza bar chatting with Dave, the owner/executive chef and he has always made me feel welcome in his restaurant and taken care of me. The whole Liberty team is awesome and the entire place is a well oiled machine. Here's a list of some of the items I have tried:

Salmon BLT - Delicious!
White Pizza - The best I've ever had!
Molinari Pizza - Fantastic!
Liberty Bowl - hearty and delicious!
Red Velvet Cake - extremely rich and wonderful (get this and split it with your dining companions)

And most recently, the Weekender Burger, which was cooked to perfection, juicy, and all-in-all just amazing (see pics)

I have, and will continue to frequent Liberty Market.  Give me Liberty Market, or give me death!"}
{"text":"Thank you for listening and adding GF and Veg items, now everyone in the family can enjoy BFast:)"}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's birthday here before going to the Wynonna concert in Scottsdale.  Both were 5 star.  We'll return to Liberty soon, great place to bring out of town guests,too !"}
{"text":"I have been a few items and i felt was a little over priced.  I am writing this review because I was told to try the salted dessert since I don't really have a sweet tooth. It's made with butter crackers chocolate salt and I think caramel melted down. It did not disappoint I would wait in line just for this.  Also on your bday you get a free dessert to go I got the bread pudding my friend who I gifted to loved it."}
{"text":"You know, there's something really special about Liberty Market and the feeling you get when you sample an honest meal featuring farm fresh ingredients, served promptly with generous portions. Some people call it \"Comfort Food\" and the label is often tossed around and rarely fits, but here it most certainly does. Great food, warm & inviting service and the best part? Honest and fair pricing."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for lunch or dinner. The food is always great. The atmosphere is really nice as well. For the guys, usually some quality women there too."}
{"text":"Although there always seems to be a long line, the food at Liberty Market is well worth it. I have visited a few times and each time I have not been disappointed. Their prices are a bit high, but the food is delicious and service so far has been great!"}
{"text":"This is first visit to Liberty Market while working my way thru Gilbert bookmarks.  Tried the pressed Maiden Lane sandwich for lunch, which is turkey, brie, red cabbage slaw, cranberry, & horseradish aioli.  Picked the rice pudding as side.  Sandwich was fine and rice pudding was pretty tasty.  Staff helpful and friendly.   Visited the espresso bar and ordered a sugar free latte, but they do not carry any sugar free syrups... Bathroom situation here is weird. Unisex bathrooms only ok if you are going to keep them clean.  Had to open 3 stalls to find a seat that was down and free of drips.  Keep the unisex concept, but at least label a couple of stalls for the ladies!  Overall, lunch experience just ok... may try breakfast some day."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is amazing! Their food never disappoints and their coffee is crave-worthy. When the weather is nice, it's perfect to sit outside, enjoy the reason we live in Phoenix metro, and enjoy what Liberty Market has to offer."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here all the time - one of our favorite places.  The owners are great and very appreciative.  The food is really good and Chef Dave is always experimenting new dishes.  If you have a chance, try to catch one of the new Community Dinners.  It's an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"Had to post another review because this time we took the in-laws - My Mother-in-law made the comment that we MUST come back to this place so she can try more.  If that is not a raving review ... I don't know what is??  Hamburger, Pasta, Pizza, Sandwiches ... all the sides.  EVERYTHING was great.  

Good, friendly service doing their best to make you happy - even with HUGE numbers of people - you get good, fast service and they have a system that gets you in & sitting painlessly.  Go. Enjoy. Repeat."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't review this place yet. The food and ambience is amazing. My son looooves the creme brûlée oatmeal and scarfs it down like there's no tomorrow. I have had multiple items on the menu and all have been delicious. I've had the Caprese Salad, all of the breakfast scrambles (including the vegan one), the Farmer sandwich, and the coffee. It's casual (which means it can be kind of loud) but there's never a problem with seating or anything else, even when it's insanely busy. The line moves quickly and the employees have always been friendly. The coffee is also top notch. The only negative is it's a little on the expensive side. Plan on at least $15 a person, minimum. I think it's worth it, though."}
{"text":"First visit- huge disappointment. There was a hair in my potatoes (breakfast).  I pointed it out to the waitress (?).  After scrutinizing my plate to make sure yes, there really was a hair, she picked it up and said she would get me a new plate and walked away.  No apology. I was disgusted and asked for a refund which took forever.  Not sure why, but I kept apologizing like it was my fault that she had to be bothered to give me a refund. Only the breakfast was refunded, not the whole meal, which means I paid for a barely touched OJ which I asked for a to-go cup since it was apparent that I wasn't going to be refunded for the whole meal.  Very sad experience, bad service, no apologies. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place (Liberty Market)...have been many times for both lunch and dinner.  Big fan of the sweet potato salad for a side. The atmosphere and food are outstanding. They have a great patio and really cool bathrooms (be prepared, they're unisex). 

The location in the heart of downtown Gilbert is also very cool...great to go for a walk after your meal. 

I'm a harsh critic...hard to give 5 stars to anyone (would give 4.5 if allowed)."}
{"text":"My son has severe nut allergies and for years we have gone there and he has always ordered bacon pancakes. We would inform them of his allergy and they would put a note on the order and make his pancakes in a separate clean skillet. We have been there on weekends, weekdays, 7am, 9am, 10am etc..  however we went there last sat 6/3 at 9am and we were told by someone who I believe was a manager who was working a second register that because of summer, they do t have enough staff and could not accommodate. We have gone there 3-4 times a month in summer, winter, spring and fall and was never told that. We even went on Mother's Day this year when they were very busy and ordered his pancakes without opposition. Sent them an email Saturday....it is now wed and no response. Unfortunately we won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy but unbelievably crowded on weekends. Can you try for the first time try to go during the week. I'm not saying it won't be good during the weekends but your wait may be a little bit because everybody loves this place :-)"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Always the best flavors.  I also have to say that the service is top notch!! KRISTIE was the best. She gave us the best service!!! She took care of us and made sure we not only enjoyed the meal we had a great experience. Definitely coming back. Thank u!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  I love the Pasta Penne!  My favorite is their breakfast.  And, don't forget to come here on your birthday.  They'll take off $10 from your bill to say Happy Birthday.  Some friends of mine say that this is part of the great birthday trifecta.  You come here for breakfast and get $10 off.  Then, you go across the street for lunch at Joe's Barbeque and get $10 off.  Then, go over to Joe's Farm Grill for dinner and get $10 off.  That sounds good to me!  Give it try sometime!"}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes are AMAZING. The fact that my birthday meal was free made it even yummier. The staff was extremely friendly and coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast, lunches, and coffee. The building is really old, but nicely renovated. The line is always long on the weekends, so I usually opt for the coffee bar where they have full service with basically no line (only about 8 seats at the bar)."}
{"text":"Had the broccoli cheddar soup and a Caesar side salad and my son had the Mac n cheese. The cordato was heavenly and my son found a new place for coffee without it being a chain location. It was lightly sweet and so lucious. A great place to meet with friends. There desserts are also wonderful. The bread pudding is a must."}
{"text":"What a delicious place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! The food is fresh and amazing. The menu changes with daily specials and also offers fresh made cookies and pasties. They also serve beer and wine which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"I recently had lunch here with several friends. It was a nice day, so we sat at an outside table which was very pleasant. You have to go inside to order, which is the only thing I don't like about the place. I ordered a Bloody Mary and the Italia Salad. Both were excellent. Two of my friends ordered the Hollywood Cobb Salad, and they both gave it rave reviews. The wait staff was very attentive, and we never felt rushed or pressured to leave even though we sat and visited for quite a while after finishing our lunch. I will definitely return to Liberty Market, and have already recommended it to other friends!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable!  You can order coffees to go and take out orders or you can eat there."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times. We don't like to have date nights here because it's usually really crowded and the seating is very close together. It is a great date in the day time which is what we did today for my birthday.  It was $10 off for my bday which is awesome. We split a pizza and some dessert items and everything was delicious. My wife took a bite of the Salt River bar and said \"oh my goodness this is amazing!\" We also got some iced coffee drinks that were also terrific. If you don't mind a crowd, this place is great. They also have free WiFi for paying customers which I have taken advantage of when I need to work away from my home."}
{"text":"Great spot. The property was a market store for many decades before closing down and renovating into this great local restaurant. The owners kept elements of the market around- look up towards the ceiling when you visit- you'll see some original shopping carts gliding along the walls. There's even a \"mini market\" near the entrance where you can purchase edibles and drinks.

The place is open, clean, and very inviting. The food is prepared in front of the patrons, no hiding. You order via counter service, find your table/booth and then the food is brought to you. The menu is great- fresh salads, sandwiches, flat bread pizzas, and soups. There's always a daily special posted near the order station so check that out before you make up your mind. Most dishes come with your choice of a cold case side item- potato salad, caprese pasta, sweet potato salad, hummus, etc. You can't really go wrong with your choice, so just follow your taste buds. All dishes I've tried are excellent. The meatball panini is great, as is the egg salad (order it with bacon). My suggestion is to visit with a group of friends, order a variety of dishes and share them. 

Liberty also offers drinks and excellent dessert items. As you wait in line to order you will be forced to pass through their dessert cases, and it will take plenty of will power to turn down something like their enormous cinnamon rolls, or cheesecake in a jar. Just try it. Many food dishes are paired with a local brew that is offered at Liberty, and they usually have great options for wine lovers as well. There's a very small patio, and if the weather is right, it's typically pretty tough to get a seat there.

Situated in old town Gilbert, among many great new restaurants, Liberty Market is a spot you should check out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch/ diner restaurant. Food are relatively healthy and delicious. There are vegan options and the atmosphere are hip and refreshing. Best for a date or just a casual meal. Only downside is that they should have waiters actually waiting the tables and taking the order instead of paying up front right from the beginning, but that isn't a big deal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here numerous times but tonight had to have been our best experience yet! We were greeted my one of the new owners, David, who personally recommended the specials... Blackened salmon on garlic mashed potatoes and the crabcake on avacado corn salad. Both entrees were perfect! Perfect size, perfect taste!  Because the portion sizes were actually normal, we also treated ourselves to desserts... Carrot cake and BlackBerry lemon bars...o...m...g.... They were both to die for!  I highly recommend the BlackBerry lemon bar if you prefer tart to sweet desserts... Excellent!!! 

While we were digesting our scrumptious dinner the owner came by again and spent time discussing their new decor and how the try to buy locally... Which explains the fresh food! 

Now I'm almost done, but like every other time I chime here I can't leave without taking home a salt river bar... They are some of the best things I've ever tasted... I took home two... One to share with a friend so I can get her addicted too! 

My suggestion... Go at off times... The place gets packed and if your impatient or in a hurry this is not the place to go... It's meant to be enjoyed and relaxed... No fast food... No hurry... Just a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never reviewed Liberty Market. Love it. The Smothered Vegan Breakfast Burrito started my day (my wife is awesome, and brought it home).
I love the cinnamon roll, don't eat one all by yourself though, trust me."}
{"text":"Fantastic and has that 'farm freshness' that is expected.  I always get the Minestrone soup with no pesto and no cheese added.  All of their burgers are great, but my favorite is their Avocado Chicken sandwich.  And the desserts are  bomb!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast with the daughter. Don't remember much about the breakfast other than the HUGE blueberry pancake and the mediocre breakfast sausage links that needed more salt. Would like to go back and try lunch or dinner fare."}
{"text":"Every review talks about the good food but let's start elsewhere, the bathrooms.  The bathroom is unisex sinks with separate doors for each stall.  Each room has it's own theme and music.  I love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.  

I've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time I got the Italia Salad.  It was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  The cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  I say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.

The 2nd time I got the Italia sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The potato salad I chose as a side was good too.  Too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  Theirs still had some texture which was nice.  It was a very satisfying meal.  We chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes). 

I love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  Even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  They have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  In addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  This is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.  

Worth the drive from Tempe.  It often is quite busy but they are good at cleaning tables and reserving seats for people in line."}
{"text":"What can I say , amazing food and great service. We split the Italian salad and Sausage pizza. both were delicious! We also enjoyed a few of their specialty coffees, cafe cubano and cortaditas. 
Save room for the delicious bread pudding made from cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"Another home run by Joe Johnston. Been going here since they opened in 2008. It just keeps getting better. Great breakfasts with excellent coffee. Also great for lunch and/or dinner. Try an amazing wood fired pizza made in their Renato oven!"}
{"text":"Ordering breakfast should be a relatively simple matter.  You're seated, you order, you pay, you go. However, at the Liberty Market Restaurant, they take a simple matter and turn it into dining hell.  

I had wanted to try the Liberty Restaurant for a while as it was always busy.  So on 03/07/14, I decided to give it a try. 

First, off, parking was interesting as is often the case with gentrified or revitalized downtown areas. 

At both entrances, there is a sign that states to \"Order Before Seating.\" I waited by one counter.  The server gave a perfunctory hello, and then proceeded to walk  by me twice while I stood there.  So I went to the other end of the restaurant and waited there.  She walked by me again, finally seating herself at the espresso bar to chat with the regulars.  I was completely ignored. 

As a customer, I can say the service was horrible.  I didn't even stay to try the food, I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant. 

Later on, when I saw their prices, I'm glad I didn't eat there.  They are very overpriced, and if the service is any indication, you're better off eating somewhere else.  

At the Liberty Market Restaurant, it seems that if you're one of the cadre, you're welcome.  If you're a new customer, then  there is no place for you there.  If you want great service, and a friendly, welcoming atmosphere...go to another restaurant instead."}
{"text":"An old market turned restaurant, Liberty Market is one joint that strongly reminds me of California. Hip, organic, fresh, and a poppin' atmosphere.

Firstly, I don't think I've ever had so much trouble deciding what to order. I went from the Tower Burger to the Lump Crab Cake, and finally settled on the Salmon BLT as we pulled up to the cashier. The decisions didn't end there. I had to order my drink for my first real meal in Arizona. By some struck of luck, the beer I was thinking (Victory Golden Monkey) was exactly what my cashier recommended to pair with the BLT. Sold!

We were seated next by our waitress, which prevents people from hoarding around tables just to save a spot. My beer came first before my sandwich, which was just what I needed to wake up in the morning.

The Salmon BLT came along with some fingerling fries. I have to say- this was probably the BEST salmon sandwich I have ever had. Grilled to perfection and steamy hot, the salmon was complimented with an extremely toasty bun, delicious bacon, and savory chipotle aioli sauce. The fries were very good as well, although I definitely did not need them after experiencing a large and delicious sandwich. Bravo to the chefs for such an amazing meal.

Before you leave- Don't forget to go use the restroom either. You may end up staying longer just to look at all the recipes written on the walls! Thanks Liberty for a fantastic first meal in the Grand Canyon state!"}
{"text":"If you are anywhere near Downtown Gilbert, you need to go here. 

Hubby and I went for a breakfast date and were impressed with the industrial/modern decor. The service was friendly. The seating area is so nice.... They have purse hooks at the bars! 

Anyways I got the Demi breakfast and a chai latte. Dan got a scone and French press. 

Demi breakfast chocolate chip pancake 5/5 stars! Love love love it!
Eggs and sausage were good but not amazing. Solid food. 

The scone was surprisingly light and fluffy! Get it if you want a light bfast. 

Now the coffee...... French press coffee was so good I barely added cream and sugar. Praise God for good coffee! 

The chai was alright. I like it spicier though. 

So overall a solid four stars! If have to eat here for lunch or dinner for it to be a five. But oh you bet we ll be back. 

Food 5/5
Price 4/5 slight pricey but worth it
Atmosphere 5/5"}
{"text":"We haven't dined here as much as the other Joe's Restaurants, but this is a really nice place and the desserts are decadent.  That's what we know because we usually get something for our birthdays.

Their breakfasts and dinners are good.  We've not had lunch here, but I'm sure it's good.  The place is trendy casual, so nice for families, small business lunch, or a date.  The service is also very friendly and wonderful."}
{"text":"This has been a staple for downtown gilbert for a long time now. They have amazing breakfast, outstanding lunch and dinner, and extraordinary desserts. You really can't go wrong here! My favorite is the white pizza but their pastas and sandwiches are good too. For breakfast try the French toast, cronuts, or creme brûlée oatmeal. Remember this is part of the Joes family restaurants that are famous so be prepared for a long line at popular time but it is definitely worth it!  The design of the building is worth seeing, and you MUST go look at all the stalls in the bathroom...I know that sounds weird but each one is individually designed and has music to go along with the stall design. Worth the visit just to see the bathrooms."}
{"text":"The Italian Grinder and Crab Po Boy sandwiches were both excellent.  Salads were also excellent.  Burger was pretty good."}
{"text":"8 of us met for dinner on a Saturday at 6:00 at Liberty Market. Parking was easy in the lot behind the restaurant. 

Food is ordered before you sit down, and a table is selected and prepared for your party when you pay for your meal. The line to order food was fairly long and took us almost 30 minutes of standing to place our orders.

Pizza's are made to your order ($11 - $15), as are sandwiches ($11-$16) and main course plates ($11 - $22+). 

2 of our party ordered pizza, and both felt a lack of toppings and a very high price. Another ordered the grilled chicken pasta, and felt that is lacked a lot of flavor and only had a few pieces of chicken in it.

An Italian member of our group ordered the eggplant parmigiana, and felt it was well cooked and had good flavor.

One of our group ordered the pretzel twist as an appetizer, and while the flavor was acceptable, the amount of cheddar cheese dip was not.

For a dessert, I had the bread pudding, which was acceptable, but nothing great.

Considering the size of the bills (mine was $85 for 3 of us), the consensus was that while this was a novel experience it was definitely overpriced for what you got.

3 stars for acceptable food"}
{"text":"**FULL DISCLOSURE: Chef David Traina is a client of the company I work for. I was NOT paid to write this review, encouraged to write this review, or compensated in any other way.**

I can't find a better breakfast burrito in the Valley! 

Seriously, get the Smothered Breakfast Burrito. 

Fluffy eggs, local spicy chorizo from Schriener's, cheese, some kind of salsa and the infamous Liberty Potatoes for good carby measure. 

The tomatillo and chile pequin sauce smothered everywhere is so good you will want to drink it. 

Big enough to share with a friend! 

Actually, let's be honest, there hasn't been much at Liberty Market I haven't enjoyed. 

Other favorites: 

1) Green Chile Pork Scramble 

I wish they'd correct it to \"Green Chile\" and not \"Green Chili\" on the menu, but the deliciousness of it all can be overlooked. It's plenty spicy, the pork is flavorful. 

2) Biscuits and Gravy 

Massive drop biscuits with Schriener's sausage in a cream gravy. We ordered this thinking it was a side; no way, this is a meal on it's own! Glad we got to try it. 

3) Margherita Pizza 

This is obviously a very simple pizza, and the ingredients shine. Plenty of fresh basil and tomatoes without being overwhelming.

This is the thin crust version which I prefer; however, I've heard excellent things about the thicker crust Sicilian style. 

Order at the counter service. 

Resist the pastry case! 

One of my favorite local spots. If you've been procrastinating paying Liberty Market a visit . . . Go, now!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Liberty Market. The outside seating looks comfortable and quaint. Grab a menu and put in your order at the cashier. The trouble is going to be picking what delicious item to devour. Today we tried the chicken salad sandwich and lump crab cakes.  Both were delicious !! My husband enjoyed the hot tea service of ginger peach tea. The staff is very efficient and helpful. We waited about 5 min and our food was delivered to our table. No problems recommending this place to anyone who wants great food and eclectic surroundings."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of \"market-made granola\" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)

I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)

p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  

Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??

{"text":"Shortly after I made my initial review, I was contacted by Joe Johnston and the liberty ownership and management team. They promptly sent me a fifty dollar gift card to give them another try! I am blown away at the effort given to retain me as a patron. Thanks, Liberty. I will give you another try!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of cafeteria style eating and waiting in line for at least 20 minutes just to order is not my thing.  I definitely wouldn't bring young kiddos here, you'll go out of your mind waiting for the food after waiting in line.  Also, sometimes you are forced to share tables with strangers and it is definitely not a great place for a private conversation.

All that being said, the food is good.  They use quality ingredients and create some delicious dishes.  It's not a cheap meal, but it's a meal you won't forget."}
{"text":"No matter when my mom, sister, niece and I go... the food is AMAZING, the coffee bar is DELISH and the employees are FANTASTIC!  It is a busy place but so worth the line at the counter. Die hard fan here!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable,  we had salads that were excellent, the burgers and pizza looked amazing.  Worth the drive from Tucson.  My fave phx place!"}
{"text":"We do like the food here. Only complaint is when they are busy they assign where you sit. My wife has back problems and can't sit in certain chairs. Being told we can't wait for a booth, just means we can't eat here. Sorry manager, you need to pay better attention to serving your customers and accommodating what may seem to you as a ridicules request."}
{"text":"What an absolutely amazing place for breakfast!  We were a party of seven and expected a long wait for seating.  Not so. So many good items on the menu it's hard to decide.  The only drawback is that bakery case full of tempting sweets..huge cinnamon rolls,  sticky buns, cookies.  Makes you want to change yOur mind and order everything!  Go. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"There is nothing not to like about this place (except that maybe the line is too long because the food is so amazing!) I love the efficient way this place is operated. The coffee is exceptional as well."}
{"text":"My accountant is right across the street from here and I arrived extremely early for our meeting and was starving so lucky me that this place was across the street. Its a big place! Very nice and simple with a cool bar to the right and food ordering to the left. Nice that you order, take a number and they bring your food to you. I was by myself and wanting to sit read and relax and they pretty much left me alone (in a good way!). 

I don't remember the name of what I ordered but very simple and good -1 pancake, 2 scrambled eggs and bacon. All was good and fast. I would definitely stop in again to check out breakfast again or lunch and I am not sure but they may have dinner too because I saw a back part of the restaurant but didn't wander."}
{"text":"Great service and fast. I love the potatoes.  
The smashed meatballs are fantastic try them for sure. 
The biscuits were home made but a little dry and they need a little more flavor in the grave.  
All in all we have been before and will go back but they need to tighten up the food was better last time we were there."}
{"text":"I just happened to be out in Chandler for a WordPress conference and on Sunday morning my friend suggested Liberty Market, which was about 10 minutes away. We pulled in around 11am for breakfast and I immediately felt the vibe of this place. We walked in and there was a pretty large line and the place was packed. I was a bit worried that it was going to take a long time to order and get our food. After waiting for about 5 minutes in line one of the waiters came by and asked us if we simply wanted to sit at the espresso bar. We were going to get espresso anyways so we said sure. We sat down and ordered 2 Cortaditos and I had the Grilled Vegetable Scramble with Egg Whites. 

Everyone was extremely friendly, from the waiters to the baristas. Before we even got our cortaditos our food was already ready. This place really had a system down pat. People were coming and going and food was flying in and out of the kitchen. I have been to a lot of breakfast places where it took forever to get food, but not at Liberty Market food is almost instantaneous, like they know what you want. 

To top it all of the food was absolutely amazing. My Scramble blew my mine, and then my Cortadito came out, and my goodness I never knew espresso could taste so good. From the hash browns, to the scramble, to the biscuit I mean everything was wonderful. My entire breakfast was under $12! 

Liberty Market had a great atmosphere and was just a great place to eat. Even though I live over 30 minutes away from LM I will say with confidence that I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere. Not a fan of waiting in line but, the food is worth it! Biscuits and Gravy were amazing as was the Lox plate. We attempted to conquer the cinnamon roll but it was way to big so we took it to go. Service left some to be desired, at times I felt that I was annoying the staff by asking questions since it was my first visit but, we will be back none the less."}
{"text":"My husband and I are considering moving to Gilbert, so we were out scouting the area and decided to refer to Yelp for breakfast. While the line at Farmhouse (next door) was out the door and I was tempted to try it, the reviewers of Liberty Market did me no wrong. 

I had the Western Scramble and it was the perfect portions with a punch of flavor. Breakfast potatos = more please (i have a thing for potatos). I also had a sticky bun, which was HUGE but the sticky frosting was moist and tasty. Between the 2 of us, we couldn't finish the 1 sticky bun, as much as we wanted to. 

The people here were all really friendly, from the counter and wait staff to the very diners enjoying their breakfasts. If I move to Gilbert, I could see myself here every weekend."}
{"text":"Great everything.  We were met at the door, shown the layout and given advice on the menu.  The food was amazing.  The apricot chicken was very, very good.  My wife loved the flat iron steak.  Great place."}
{"text":"It seems this place keeps getting better and better! The lines could use a bit of work as they are usually way too long during dinner hours, but the food is quite reasonable. I always enjoy the chicken pasta (forget what it's called) and their white pizza. This is a nice spot for a relaxed dinner or even a dinner date!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!  Great, classic food with a twist.  Something different but not too different.  Great atmosphere, great staff, great concept!  I have been here countless time and taken anyone that says they have never been and everyone loves it!  Unique, fun, clean convenient, and GREAT food!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time today. My daughter and I shared the chef's special pizza. It was a thin crust with the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings, just big enough for the 2 of us to share and be satisfied, but not be over stuffed. Everything tasted really fresh and well prepared.  Would've been 5 stars... but service seemed a bit impersonal. Still a solid 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but everything downtown Gilbert seems to be these days.  I love that the food is approachable and the dessert options are plenty.  Pet friendly patio is nice too for those awesome desert days."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan perfectly describes how I feel about Liberty Market. I am a fan on weekdays when it is not completely packed and a 45 minute line. Yay for outdoor seating in the heart of downtown Gilbert. Hooray for the employees of LIberty Market who ask you where you would like to sit and hold your table so you have a place to go after the line. Three cheers for the garlic smash, flatbread pizza, chicken Caesar salad, and lemon/raspberry bar. Super cute cocktails in a bottle and very tempting dessert to go options. Delicious food and great vibe but they have to figure out a way to decrease the wait time to get to it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Super fresh ingredients and the service is awesome. I could eat here three times a week and not get sick of it. I love the white pizza and the burgers are excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see what's cooking on the weekend. I don't mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito."}
{"text":"Give me Liberty or give me a breakfast platter! Hmm it doesn't have the same ring as Patrick Henry's words but Liberty Market's breakfast platters are quite good! I was in the area and looking for a dog friendly breakfast spot and this restaurant fit the bill. It was a bit awkward having a dog here though due to the ordering system since you have to wait in line inside to order and pay, and non-service dogs are technically not allowed inside eating establishments. I had read a previous review saying that the reviewer was allowed to place her order with a server at the door. When I walked tentatively inside near the door with my dog, I asked if I could place my order with someone since I had my dog with me, but they said I could wait in line with my dog like everyone else. I'm not sure if this is their normal policy but hey, it worked well enough for me.

I ordered the vegan American standard breakfast. It is a well rounded platter with scrambled tofu, avocado, sweet potatoes, mixed greens salad, wheat toast and blueberry preserves. I enjoyed the soft texture of the tofu which tasted very similar to scrambled eggs and the sweet potatoes were well seasoned and were nicely caramelized from cooking. The avocado was fresh, and the blueberry preserves tasted good but were too watery to be able to spread onto toast with a knife. The salad was also very fresh and I enjoyed the flavor profile of the dressing but the dressing itself tasted too oily. 

I noticed as I started to dig into the potatoes that there was something unusual-looking on my plate. I stopped and examined my plate closer to find that there was a bird poop on it! I flagged down a waitress and asked for a new plate of potatoes which was done for me without hesitation. Apparently the chef said that it is a sign of good luck. I guess it's good luck that I didn't actually eat it or that the poop didn't land on my head instead.

I washed everything down with a house-made almond milk which was creamy and refreshing.

Due to the unexpected extra \"ingredient\" in my breakfast I'm not sure I'd dine on the patio again but I'd definitely like to stop by again to try something different."}
{"text":"Liberty has the best service out of any restaurant I've ever been to. They pride themselves on it unlike Joes BBQ across street. All the employees always have a smile on their faces. Now that we are regulars they remember what we get every time and are always very accommodating. I can't understand why some restaurants don't value the impact of good service. I think Joes BBQ service sucks because they know they are the best and you will still come regardless(which I do unfortunately). The food at Liberty is always on point. It's always consistent. The environment is good. Even when it's busy it a nice place to eat at. I always get a burger and it is one of the best burgers I've ever had. We get oven fries which is amazing as well as the potato salad. For dessert the rice pudding is always a good choice. Their cookies are amazing too. All and all everything is perfect. This is one of the most well run restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"Food comes out slow. Long wait line, just don't come here during busy hours. Food is good but not sure if it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for breakfast..you go in and order and then they give you a number and you sit and wait for your food.  I ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo..it was very bland and really greasy.  Maybe I shoulda waited and went next door to The Farmhouse again, next time I will."}
{"text":"I love EVERYTHING about liberty Market except:
Not a fan of their assigned seating. We were here this morning and requested a booth. We were told \"No\". As I sat, I noticed 3 booths with parties of 2 seated directly after us. I do not like the small tables on top of each other as it doesn't give much privacy in conversations. In my opinion \"trust us it works\" isn't necessarily true. When you spend $30 on breakfast for 2 and this was with only one beverage I think the customer should be comfortable. We were also told outdoor seating wasn't available. The food was great but accommodation--not so much."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price point. You can't beat the atmosphere as well. They do a good job of always having something new and fresh on the menu."}
{"text":"Yum! I think it was sometime last August when I first tried Liberty Market. My friend and I met there with our small lap dogs for dinner. Having not been there before, we didn't realize that even if you want to eat on the patio, you need to order your meal from inside the restaurant - not an ideal situation having the pups with us and all. One of the waitresses saw us with our dogs looking sort of stumped and told us to come around the side of the building to the coffee area.  There, we were able to stand in the doorway and order our food, to eat on the patio with our dogs as intended! Not only was the food tasty ( I had the spaghetti and meatballs), but the service was beyond accommodating and for that reason I am a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Went with a diverse group of people/dietary needs and everyone left happy and full! This is a cool restaurant and has an awesome vibe. Everyone went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and satisfied and we truly had a great time. This is a definite stop to bring visitors and date night!"}
{"text":"Great food, always fresh and innovative items on the menu. The staff is very friendly and attentive to what's going on. I also like that much of their produce comes from local sources."}
{"text":"Got a bread pudding to go. 80% of it was soggy. Only the top you could see was cooked. The rest was literally dough."}
{"text":"I love their s'more bread pudding and cinnamon rolls! I've only had their desserts, and every time it's amazing!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot.  The service is always amazing.  I would say better than 5 stars.  The food is sometimes unbelievable and sometimes disappointing.  I like the place enough to keep coming back though and like I said the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I come here for a. Nice quick breakfast.  I come for the free refills on very bold coffee ad a yummy pastry. 

The restaurant is nice with an outdoor patio where I bring my pups over after walking downtown Gilbert. 

Every Tuesday they have a new flavor Dosant (a doughnut and croissant). 

the breakfast dishes are ok but nothing out of the ordinary.  a little pricey for what you get.  

I give the restaurant more stars because looks cool, but I give food a \"3\".  Hence the \"4\" star rating. 

Ok I have to the Give their excellent baker Ladonna a 5 Star rating!!! The dosants are scrumptious. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a cool, trendy lunch spot. Came here during the lunch rush and it was very crowded. However, I ordered and received my food in a reasonable amount of time. 

The chilaquiles is excellent and a very large portion. They also serve Stumptown coffee and have a large selection of beer."}
{"text":"After a few more great date nights, this place could easily get that extra star.

My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday, and we had a delicious dinner. Their food is damned tasty, and even though there's nothing really surprising per se, you'll probably find some interesting things to try out and enjoy. She got the hamburger, and I got the salmon special. Both were delicious, filling, and quickly delivered.

We came here again for coffee and dessert, and the Market did *NOT* disappoint. The bread pudding with fig was amazing, and the lemon-blueberry bar was a nice tart treat. Their coffee selection is nice as well, and they actually make a really decent cuban coffee. 

All in all, I really loved this place and I look forward to coming back. A few more good meals here and they'll certainly get that fifth star from me."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem! I will always come here. Downtown Gilbert is so lucky to have Liberty Market! Everything is delicious. I especially enjoy the pizzas and the flat-iron steak entree. My husband loves the Cuban sandwich. My favorite thing on the menu is the bread pudding dessert. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm that guy who's always poo-pooed Gilbert as a place where terrified suburbanites imported restaurant ideas from the big, scary city to a place where they felt safe. 

But Liberty Market isn't one of those restaurants. It does things its own way, and it does them well.

Some key takeaways

1. Everything tastes good. Literally every single thing on the menu that I've tried has been amazing.

2. The burger, pizza and fish of the week change (you guessed it) every week. So there's always something new and exciting on the menu.

3. Buy an eclair. I don't even like pastries, and I die for Liberty's eclairs. Buy one for dessert and one to take home. 

4. When in doubt, go Italia salad or any pizza. They're just magnificent.

5. Buy the wine. Liberty is really good about having affordable and tasty wines. 

6. Expect to pay about $25 per person if you want food and a beverage. It's totally reasonable for the quality you get. If you just want entrees, you can skate away on $15 a person."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to this place for about a year.  WOW! Regretting not having gone there earlier.  Great Food, Great Service and Interesting seating.  The line was almost out the door when we arrived but it was to be expected on a Friday night. There was a line the entire time we were there and we probably waited 35-40 in line and maybe another 15 to get our food... so I might suggest plan to wait or come a little earlier we arrived about 6:30 PM.   My son said they make you wait in line so you are super hungry looking at all the food.  LOL. His cheese pizza was great!  Good size and crispy crust.  My daughter had the pasta with meatballs and bread.  Delicious!!!  Three good size meatballs and plenty of pasta.  Hubby had the Hot Brown.  The turkey was yummy, the béchamel YUMMO and the bacon was perfectly crisp.  I had the Short Rib Rigatoni.  This may be my favorite restaurant dish now!!!  The meat was so tender.  The dish was flavored perfectly and the pasta was just the right amount. I had three rigatoni left and I said nope... not going to leave those uneaten.  Loved that the had self serve drinks so refills on those were easy.  We were asked twice if we were ready for dessert... but not rushed.  We ordered the lemon bar and a salt river bar.  So good.  We quarter them both and shared.  Plates were cleaned no left overs here.  We will be back for sure!   I heard both lunch and breakfast were a hit too."}
{"text":"Came here with friends who love the place. Food was ok,  well prepared, with friendly service. I'm more of a traditionalist so the pizza was not my favourite of the evening. Nothing wrong with it just not my style of food preparation. Wife loved her soup of the day entree"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food great ambiance and desserts to die for!!! The manager Christopher was so nice and personable. He took the time out to talk to us and was very informative. We loooove the orange rolls... Honestly anything in their desert case is awesome. This place is definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and just will say that the menu is awesome because it has all different kinds of foods whether it's morning or night. I like the steak with chimichurri sauce or the chicken sandwich. This is also one of the restaurants you can get a discount on your meal if it's your birthday."}
{"text":"Liberty market does have a certain down home country feel too it. Having said that, Its about the only thing it has going for it. They have a limited menu, which all items are over priced, but that may be due to the fact they do not have waiters? cause you place an order at the bar, get your own drinks and silverware , so theres not alot of service.
The food was decent but again because of the price $14 for chx pasta bowl it wasn't that good. slice of pizza (size of a redbaron french pizza) $7. 

This isnt the main reason I will never go back but i feel like I should mention it. There was an employee that \"white pride\" on his forearms and other offensive tats. if this is a family resturant why woud this be ok? And what does that say about the management that is fine with this employee representing them?"}
{"text":"Minimalist yet stylish decor.
Food is fresh and service is great. Had their Cobb salad with balsamic vinaigrette which had a little too much dressing for my liking but it was tasty loaded with tons of bacon and chicken. Rice pudding comes in 3 diff sizes, be hungry if you're going to get anything other than a small cup. Their pomegranate green tea is unsweetened and refreshing. :)"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night at 7:45. Not too crowded. It was our first time here and we ordered the Margherita pizza and the White Pizza. The Margherita pizza was very good and the basil gave it a bold flavor. The white pizza had pine nuts on it that gave it a great crunch and the flavors were great together. The menu looks delicious here and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place, the coffee is great (my fav part) and what Ive eaten is pretty yummy........ but can a girl get some more vegetarian options here? Lay some goat cheese on me will ya!"}
{"text":"Liberty market is fast becoming one of my favorite lunch time treats. They have a menu that while not huge seems to have something for everyone. I am in love with their white pizza. The bread is fabulous and while it has some unique ingredients(Arugula and pine nuts) they are not just their to be trendy they truly add to the flavor of the pizza. 

The atmosphere is great and it is going to sound weird, but you should make a trip to the bathroom while you are there."}
{"text":"Recently tried the Liberty Market restaurant. This had been on my list to try for sometime. Overall, it's a pretty neat place. it's an old supermarket converted to a restaurant. Good concept. They have a electic menu of food items. We went there for a late lunch with friends. There are chicken sandwich's, burgers, pizza, etc...I had the Cuban sandwich (I love those) and my wife had the Hollywood Cobb salad. Menu's are available when you walk in and you order at the end of the line. We ordered after we sat down to look over the menu. The food is pretty decent. Not over the top, but I would go back again. The salad is big enough to take home and have later. The Cuban sandwich had a different twist to it. It had red cabbage on it. Something I had not seen before. The sandwich also comes with a side. All you can drink beverage bar is a nice touch. if you are into pizza, they have a really nice brick oven that they are baked in. 
I did think it was a little pricey, but that would not stop me from going there again."}
{"text":"After driving by Liberty Market at least once a week, a girlfriend and I finally decided to go out and give dinner a try! 

The service wasn't all that bad. The girl who took my order was outgoing and nice. I ordered the vegetarian wood fire pizza and a sangria. After about 10 minutes I finally got the sangria which I was slightly disappointed in since moments before I saw a large jug being brought out from some back room that looked store bought. I was also hoping it would have more fruit but it had a small orange slice inside.

By the time the food had gotten to our table, I had finished my drink and it had been almost 30 minutes. The pizza wasn't bad considering the lack of creativity the pizza had. The size was great but as for topping go, there were large chucks of mushrooms, thinly sliced zucchini and large chunks or asparagus. The flavor was lacking something but I ended up eating all of the pizza.

For dessert, I chose the bread puddling for my friend and I to share because the woman at the register said it was 'super yummy' and after waiting for another 15, the dessert came and it was far from special. There was more whipped cream on the dish than anything else (probably to compensate from the watery consistency that was called pudding). We maybe both had 4 bites combined. It tasted like watered down French toast almost. 

Anyway, the food was 2 out of 5 and the service was a 4 out of 5 but I don't think I'd come here again."}
{"text":"1st time visit. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere.  Trying to eat light, I Ordered the Demi breakfast. Scrambled eggs: good, flattened meatball, mushy & lacked flavor, biscuit: BisQuick :-(.  I will return again to splurge on some sweets. Those all looked tempting."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place in downtown Gilbert look no further.   One of my favorites for breakfast or lunch.  Great quality and excellent ambiance.  Has a very local contemporary feel.  I love supporting local businesses and this place is at the top of my list.   Same family that owns Joes BBQ and Joes Farmhouse so you know they don't slack on anything.  Even if your not that hungry the coffee bar is excellent.  You can't go wrong and let me know when you go so I can join you!!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Bridgett was great to great us with a big smile and gave us lots of suggestions on what to order. I ordered the pasta chicken dish that have a cream sauce that you will lick your plate clean. My husband had the weekly burger that was juicy and he loved the flavor. My son in law got the liberty bowl which I have gotten a lot, their meatballs are fabulous."}
{"text":"-Wait in line to order your food, the Hostess will seat you, and someone will bring your food to your table.

-Friendly service.

-Parking sometimes sucks, depending when you go.

-BUSY, busy, busy...they claim they will find you a table, while you wait in line to order...but, what if the table hogs who are DONE EATING continue chatting for hours and NEVER leave and there are no tables available???

-The restrooms are unisex. The toilets are individual restrooms and the day I went they smelled like urine, pee-pee men's restrooms. GROSS! Usually the restrooms smell clean...

-YUMMY pizzas! Baked in a fire brick oven.

-Yummy salads! Perfect portions! $9+. 

-Italia sandwich is a bit weird...what is that sweet vinegar jelly on the bread? Too gourmet for my liking!

-Sandwiches come with a side of your choice.

-Ambiance is like eating in a trendy warehouse.

-I like Liberty Market!"}
{"text":"Good little cafe.  Today we had the crab cake sandwich and a supreme pizza.  The crab cakes were good but we preferred to eat them without the bread.  The supreme pizza was great, it's cooked in a wood fire oven, and while some could eat the whole pizza, most would choose to share.  We also tried a chocolate chip cookie, very good.  Service was good but a little slow.  Overall a great place."}
{"text":"My BF and I came here last night with my parents and really liked it. Three of us had the Best Chicken sandwich and the other had the Tower Burger. Everything tasted pretty good. I'll admit that my chicken sandwich wasn't AWESOME by any means, but it was pretty good. I opted for the caprese pasta salad instead of the kettle chips but it was a bit bland; next time I'll try the potato salad instead. 

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was great. I felt we were a lucky table because we got to sit outside where it was a little quieter then inside, plus the weather was wonderful. 

For now I'll leave the rating at 4 stars because I want to go back and try some of their other selections but all in all it was a great night and we're looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Concept and Great Execution.. 

All the breakfast items are awesome, Along with any dinner entree I've tried. Someone is always around to help, And management is always present and helping out! 

Great Restaurant, food & Service!!"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB!  We tried it for the first time last night based strictly on YELP reviews as we are traveling. We were looking for a cool place to grab a bite and a drink and Liberty fit the bill but the service and food quality knocked it out of the park. They don't have dedicated servers for each table. 

Instead, they have a staff of dedicated servers who take turns checking on guests and tending to all needs. It was really cool and friendly. We need to give a special shout out to our three main servers:

Elizabeth, James and Patrick.  You guys were great and we followed up on your suggestions on what else to check out in the area!  

(Elizabeth, thanks for the awesome specialty drink!). 

Oh yeah, the food!  The PAELLA was outstanding and could not be improved upon. The flank steak was cooked perfectly and in both cases, the presentation was impressive. 

This is our Gilbert go to!  Thanks Libery!"}
{"text":"It would be totally unfair to you my fellow yelper, if I didn't update this review to tell you more about Liberty Market every time I visit, even if it has been less than a month since I've been here last.

I had a friend visiting from out of town and I would not be the hostess with the mostess unless I brought her to Liberty Market.

It was a busy saturday night, there was a long line, we were hungry and thirsty. We quickly made it to the back of the line and started looking at a menu. The hardest part about eating here is deciding what you will eat. 

A seating host came by, asked us if we wanted to seat inside or outside, once we told him he gave us a card with a number and said he would go and find us a table. We quickly got to the cashier and ordered our food. White pizza and the Picnic Salad, the cashier asked if we would be sharing the salad and offered(anticipating our needs, whaaaaaat?) to split the salad for us. We also ordered some drinks from the bar. Once we had our water we headed to the outside area and there was our table! Great system to assign tables! Once we sat down our drinks were delivered so fast you'd think they were delivered by jimmy johns. The drinks were delicious and very refreshing. 
Once the pizza arrived and my friend the avid instagrammer took pictures of the food, we were in heaven. This pizza is so good, it is making my mouth water.
I am in love with Liberty Market."}
{"text":"I ordered the NY steak sandwich.... very good meal.  My daughter ordered some kind of veggie sandwich with goat cheese.... she wasn't happy with!  Then we shared a strawberry shortcake for dessert, very good!"}
{"text":"Had a Saturday morning downtown Gilbert date with my boyfriend and we tried this place for the first time. It was really busy for brunch on Saturday because of the Farmers Market but it was worth the wait. The iced lattes are delicious and the Grilled Bread Pudding my boyfriend ordered was so tasty! I ordered the Biscuits and Sausage Gravy and really enjoyed that too! We are hoping to go there again soon. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee.  Well prepared and roasted by Stumptown. Also had an amazing dessert. Ice cream sandwich... Mmmmmm. While I wouldn't write home about the Liberty Joe, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I've been working on a project down the street from this business and therefore found it to be a wonderful place to meet off property or just stop in to grab something.  But please do not be misled by the name in thinking that this is anything of a market.  I'd question whether the owners really know what they want it to be, which is a common complaint from me when visiting these upscale \"market\" cafes.  But so be it.... here's my take on the experience:

Visit #1: Morning coffee meeting before heading into the office.  I was thrilled by the way the owners have renovated this old space.  Furthermore, it was a quick and comfortable experience for my morning coffee needs.  Coffee was pretty good too.

Visit #2: Lunch meeting with colleagues.  There were six of us, which posed a seating challenge in the busy restaurant at first, but then an employee/manager noticed us and helped out.  I ordered the Arizona Sky, which was a tasty ham sandwich, and enjoyed a wonderful sweet potato salad on the side.  The sandwich, with a cup of coffee, was roughly $9 if memory serves correctly.  While quite tasty, I hope the lunch prices come down as more worthy competition enters the market.  So, overall, great place for an occasional change of pace, but not something I'd do frequently. 

Visit #3: Another coffee meeting.  This time, I was feeling a little like having a snack, so I thought it was great that we were in a \"market.\"  And this is when I remembered that this place is not really a market at all.  Yes, that's what I thought was off about this place -- I knew something wasn't clicking for me.

So in summary, I'd say that this is a nice little breakfast/lunch restaurant, but not quite what I wanted it to be based on its name or history.  And hey, yet another interesting take on the classic casual cafe/diner vibe will only help this genre of restaurant move forward in Arizona, so I'll keep tabs and look forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"Great food and incredible coffee / espresso bar. Wish they had mor gluten free and low carb options. Nevertheless, Chef Dave never makes anything bad and most things are incredible.

This is always one of our favorite places to eat"}
{"text":"I had the cordon bleu burger and it was delicious.... as was the bread pudding. My partner had the fennel and sausage pizza and it was also delicious. I love the atmosphere of the building & how dog friendly it was. I'm definitely a fan and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this spot yet?! Liberty is our staple breakfast spot (FYI- this review is primarily about breakfast). If you can get a seat at the coffee bar, that is supreme (shhh, don't tell anyone or all the best seats will be taken!). The baristas and staff are personable and courteous. I always feel like I'm being treated to a personal experience when I eat there. And the food is fantastic. We've tried literally every item on the breakfast menu and the only thing that led to was a harder time making a decision! I'm sure I've given the servers a few headaches with my lengthy deliberations. What I really appreciate is they have several healthy choices- vegetarian, vegan, you got it. And it's good stuff too, not the usual, boring \"low fat\" egg white omelet (ick!). They're happy to substitute healthier options in most of the menu items (i.e. egg whites instead of regular eggs, dairy free, etc.) so those with food restrictions have a lot of options. 

Note: one of the reasons I love the coffee bar is because it is traditional. They hold coffee to a high standard, creating fresh and pure classics that I can't get enough of. I feel like I'm in a 1950's cafe (oh so fancy).

-Cortado (my go-to), or if you want to share with a friend get the Cortadito
-Irish (a little hair of the dog, well-balanced of course) 
-French Press- they use high-quality coffee so the french press is always smooth with a great, bold flavor. 

Food recommendations (I'll try to keep it to a few...may I just recommend the entire breakfast menu for starters?)
-The Griddled Bread Pudding is hands down the best \"french toast\" I've ever had! 
-The Chilaquiles are on point
-The Chorizo Sweet Potato Hash is a very tasty spin on a traditional hash.
-For my health nut buddies- go for the Smothered Vegan Breakfast Burrito or Grilled Vegetable Scramble. 

Quick aside- we've eaten lunch there a handful of times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is in a great location. When I went last weekend there were also farmers markets happening near by. My favorite part is how clean and friendly the environment and kitchen space is. Everywhere you walk you can see what they're doing, it makes me feel at peace knowing that they take great care of the kitchens and prepare the food safely. I love all the decor too, even in the bathroom. The food is all well presented and definitely worth the long wait we had in line to order. Everything was super delicious!! I ordered the vegan american standard breakfast and the scrambled tofu wasn't bland or boring at all. My dirty chai was delicious and the people I ate with were very satisfied with their meals too. I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Liberty Market can't be beat for fresh ingredients, wonderful flavor combinations and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here with husband for anniversary for breakfast. He got the buttermilk pancakes & side of bacon. I got the Demi breakfast: scrambled eggs, biscuit, sausage gravy. We both got a side of the liberty potatoes & a cinnamon roll to share. Waiting in line took awhile. There were people up ahead that couldn't make up their mind. When the food came, they forgot my husbands bacon and said it wasn't on the ticket. But they happily got him his side of bacon. Food was delicious. My one small complaint was that they don't season the food in the kitchen. (They have salt & pepper on the table.). It's just not the same when you add the seasoning after the food is cooked. But other than that the food was great, nice and fresh. My husband is a very picky eater so when I can find somewhere he loves.... Score!!!"}
{"text":"Holy carp, do I love this place! It's my new favorite weekend breakfast hangout.

Brak and I have figured out how to maneuver at Liberty Market (best tip: get in the door before 9) and have had about six good breakfasts in a row. I'm currently on a not-much-meat kick -- as opposed to my all-ribs-all-the-time kick -- so I've only had the veggie scramble with toast.

My order is a little different each time, but always good. Sometimes the veggies are cut more fine, and the cooks obviously add them in different proportions depending on mood. I love that they have a light hand on the cheese in their eggs...when the already-good potatoes are light on cheddar, they are the best.

This menu definitely offers several choices for ridiculously unhealthy breakfasts. Cinnamon rolls, biscuits, several forms of bread pudding, plus gravy makes my head hurt. Sticking with the eggs pays off; they are the freshest eggs I've ever tasted in Arizona."}
{"text":"The pecan sticky bun is a must try! They are HUGE! Even sharing we had half of it left. We came for breakfast and will definitely be coming back to try dinner here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time and I love EVERYTHING on their menu. Everything from the regular menu to Dossant Tuesdays to weekend specials. You cannot go wrong! Stopped in this past weekend for the Rib Eye special with green chile sauce, crispy smashed potatoes, and sautéed green beans. Be sure to follow their instagram as well! They update their page almost daily to let you know about their specials every week."}
{"text":"This area of Gilbert is so quaint!  But even if I was in love with its surroundings, we always stop by when we're in the mood for delicious desserts, specifically the red velvet cheesecake, which is indescribable.  You just have to try it!  As for the regular food, I've tried a different entree each time, and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved this place and will be back again. Good food, great vibe, friendly staff. As we were waiting in line, a staff member asks how many are in your party, then reserves a seat for you, so you're not holding a bunch of items trying to find an open spot. Sweet potato muffin was dee-lish, as was my coffee and rest of meal. Hubs ordered the Chilaquiles with pork and said it was amazing. We beat the long line many others have mentioned, but did see it while we were eating. A lot was going on that Sat. morning... farmers market and an art festival. Just makes for a great area to be around on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"Great food. They give you a voucher for your birthday which I think is a great idea. Delicious breakfast options"}
{"text":"I love this place! Those who know me know that there's nothing I like more than a tasty breakfast (most important meal of the day, duh!) I like the design and vibe of this place not to mention the food is to die for! I love their breakfast burritos and sweet potato muffins (so good!) 

I don't really have anything bad to say about this place. It's one of those (similar to Sauce) where you order in line and then they bring it out to you. Overall, I love this place!"}
{"text":"We love Saturday morning breakfast at Liberty! You'll need to get there early or be ready to wait. I did notice that the breakfast taste very different during the weekday- not as good. The dinner is good too but very expensive. Overall, we like the feel and food."}
{"text":"love the vegan and vegetarian options-always busy-always delish! great home made goodies and fresh choices."}
{"text":"Today, on Day 1 in 107 degree \"my face is on fire\" Phoenix, also marked my first experience at Liberty Market. Here are all things worth noting, for those of you taking notes. (For those of you not taking notes, I can just text you):

1) The ordering system is similar to a Corner Bakery, in that, you pay first then take a number, then they bring food to your table. What is nice/different, though, is that you get a hard menu to hold in line, instead of having to look up at a board behind the counter. This allows The Indecisive some intimate time alone to analyze and dissect each and every option without the board making their glances feel like they've overstayed their welcome.
2) It's a better value than Panera, who's been sneaking up their prices and making my wallet whine. Places like Liberty Market are fighting back, so one day our kids will say, \"Panwhera?\" #forced
3) I ordered the Farmer sandwich and a side of Hummus. It should be in the Constitution that hummus should always be served with soft bread, never hard toasty toast. (Note for next time, folks, especially if you want it changed to \"Life, Liberty MARKET, and the Pursuit of Happiness\"). 
The Farmer sandwich was not as hot as it could've been, probably because of the waiter's poor pickup timing from the kitchen....
...but how long could I stay mad at the waiter when, 4) he gave me free coffee? Or maybe he just gifted the coffee because I looked like I had to poop and he was just trying to push me over the edge...
5) They REALLY won my heart, though, by playing my favorite Oasis song, \"Don't Look Back in Anger.\" It was as if they were spoonfeeding me through my ears."}
{"text":"I think I found one of my new favorite places in Gilbert! It may be a bit of a hipsters paradise but I don't care...the food is so yummy! The ambiance is refreshing since there's too many chain food places in the east valley and you have to search high and low for something with a cool vibe. The drive is a bit much for us but I can see myself planning a 1/2 day in downtown Gilbert for food and shopping. Liberty is also a family friendly place and with the patio outside I hear is dog friendly too. Perfect for us since we're having our baby real soon and love to take our dog with us too. 

Service was great. Everyone is so friendly and seating was not an issue. 

Back to the food..I ordered the Salmon BLT and loved it. My husband ordered the veggie scramble and though he commented that the eggs looked a bit overcooked he said he couldn't taste it being overcooked. He cleaned his plate within minutes. So no real complaints from us. Next time we go, I'll try one of the salads or side pasta dishes, those looked appetizing. The monster sized desserts were tempting but I'll save that for another trip as well."}
{"text":"Interesting popular place in downtown Gilbert. Has an updated 1950s diner vibe. You order from a counter, like a cafeteria line, pay, then they deliver to your table. Limited alcohol. Good was fine/good but not memorable. We may be back but it's not our first choice in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Good food but the line took forever. Seating was kinda crowded also. It is basically a glorified sandwich shop but I would eat there again for a casual lunch. They do nickel and dime you for all your food items and drinks and there is no server once you pay at the counter. So when we wanted dessert we had to go stand in line again- kinda a bummer."}
{"text":"I finally made it out to Liberty Market on Sunday!! I really had a good time here, and had a really positive experience. What a great experience. 

Upon walking in, I saw that they had a little area selling stuff, like sauces, noodles and a bunch of other stuff. Very aesthetically pleasing to my eye. I really like how this place is decorated. Clean, modern, but understated. Cute! They have shopping carts full of product to buy, such as Olives, and other stuff. 

The staff greeted me warmly, and handed us menus. I saw the red velvet cake in the case, but never ended up ordering any. Patrick and I studied the menu, ordered at the counter. The register girl seemed young, and had an idea of what she was doing, but ultimately, never got our sense of humor. We were joking with her, and she didn't think we were all that funny, or was being to serious to laugh. I wont hold it against her, because she was young, but it was entertaining the say the least. Cute. 

I cant remember what Patrick had, but I went with the burger, fries, and a drink. We also got an appetizer of the pizza thing with Hummus. Delicious! I love the dishes here too. Totally my style of a place. My hamburger was amazing! Delicious! mmmmmm. I love a good burger!

Service was amazing here for us to. Staff made sure we had a good time and checked on us continuously. I liked that.  

I will return in the future!"}
{"text":"A group of us came to Liberty Market for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. they were slightly busy, but not filled to capacity. They have a great selection on the menu, very unique. I found it hard to choose my entree. I ended up ordering the crab cake, with a side kale salad. After ordering we sat. I was a little disappointed when my plate arrived. The crab cake was pretty small with just a small pinch of lettuce. I thought to myself 'wow, this is small for the price.' (I'm a big guy with large appetite) I asked the server, \"that's my kale salad?\" he replied \"yes sir.\" I was charged extra 4 dollars for the salad alone. Really disappointing. Then a few minutes later the server returned and apologized and said \"sorry sir, THIS is your kale salad.\" MUCH BETTER! the lettuce on the plate was garnishment! The crab cake was delicious, and so was the salad. While it was a small portion for MY appetite, I ended up leaving satisfied. I will go back. I really like this place."}
{"text":"I loved Liberty Market! Need to go more often.   It's reasonably priced with great food and good selection. The grilled cheese is excellent. Great atmosphere in Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and have been twice to Liberty Market (Once for dinner and once for brunch). Both times food was outstanding as was the service.  I think this will be a favorite of ours and a place we will want to take company too."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while (busy with a baby) and there are so many changes;  pretty much all good. Improved, more comfortable seating options and an updated menu with all the good standbys from the previous menu. Very impressed. :)"}
{"text":"Food is good.  No kids menu though.  Because of that I give it only three stars.  I also think it is slightly over priced for a 'market.'  I ate in San Fran with a similar menu and it was less expensive than Liberty Market.  If you dont mind spending the extra money for good quality food Liberty Market is good for you."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  Service has always been great, very personable crew!  Food has always exceeded expectations. Atmosphere is relaxing inside and out."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is by far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. Everything I have eaten has been fantastic, the featured burgers are always my favorite. Fabulous pizzas and sandwiches and cinnamon rolls as big as your head! The food is so fresh and they have a way of taking something simple and making it something extraordinary!

The atmosphere is really awesome, it's just so... cool. Everyone who works here is so nice and always makes sure we are happy with everything. I just love it!

If I had to complain about something, it would be that the menu isn't really made for kids. There are no smaller options for kids at all. Of course you could always share and that's what we do with our toddler, but we can only do that so long before we are spending as much on her dinner as our own."}
{"text":"This place was worth the wait! We stood in line approximately 15 minutes (at 11am on a Sunday) before placing our order and being seated. While waiting to place your order you are forced to walk past the pastry case, filled with delectable treats such as French macaroons, sweet potato muffins, and the largest cinnamon rolls you will ever lay eyes on. Of course we had to try several items: the honey lavender macaroon and the sticky bun. The macaroon had a nice light flavor, definitely an enjoyable small treat. The sticky bun was massive, enough for several people to share. 
For entrees I had the green chile pork scramble, my mother had the bread pudding, and my boyfriend had the lox and bagel. All 3 were delicious with the only complaint being that the bagel was a little on the tough side. 
Can't wait to go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"This place was just okay for us....I was expecting something similar to La Grande Orange based on a write up in the New Times, for me La Grande Orange is much superior.
We went here  last Saturday  for breakfast and the place was practically empty around 9:00am (prime time),
We had the Western Scramble and Grilled Vegetable Scramble, ....they describe on the menu \"eggs scrambled with flank steak\", but there were two small pieces barely the size of a quarter...nothing stood out about the dish either.  My friend had the grilled vegetable scramble, she also mentioned the dish didn't have many vegetables and thought it was just okay.
The restaurant next door the Farm House was much busier (although i think same owner), after eating here and not being too impressed, it made sense why."}
{"text":"The white Pizza is off the hook, one of my favorite places to eat in the Valley. Go Joe & Team! If you like this place also check out Joes real bbq and Joes farm Grill. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"One does not expect to find such a gem in Gilbert: great quality coffee, exquisite service and a menu that is nothing short of divine. Once you  learn the past culinary excursions of the owner Joe J, you understand. This java mogul is responsible for the violently successful Coffee Plantation and Joes BBQ, but lets not talk anymore about the Vuitton wielding entrepreneur. Liberty Markets chef David Traina is brilliant, his use of simple ingredients and modern takes on classic dishes is a breath of fresh air. Simple, honest food that does not try to be the El Bulli of Gilbert. The E61 bar is the perfect place for chic writers who enjoy a french press and good conversation. Thank you Liberty Market for showing me that Gilbert does have its well rounded individuals. For those of you who walk on you're knuckles and have negative things to say about L.M there is a Ihop down the street."}
{"text":"Yum! Quality food is here! I honestly didn't expect much. We went during the week and it was not busy at all. All the dishes we ordered was excellent. The desserts were phenomenal !!! I wish definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and it rolled in this weekend for an early breakfast and I was surprised/disappointed that at 8am they didn't have everything set up in the food cases, so as first timers, we didn't really get to see everything Liberty Market has to offer. So there we stood for a few minutes grazing over the menu and we finally decided on a few entrees and coffees, which for four people totaled about $50, which for what we got, I kind of expected more out of the experience. The food was alright, and the service was great, but I'm not sure if I'd opt to come here again for breakfast. Maybe dessert and coffee, because the selection looked pretty solid. My Mom's veggie scramble was legit, it came with potatoes which were well seasoned and a crusty biscuit which she said were pretty good. I ordered the chef's breakfast sandwich which came with a mediocre pile of fruit. You know it wasn't the best sandwich you ever ate when at the end of the meal there's large shreds of bread and general  sandwich debris laying around on your plate."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! My friend and I went for a late lunch and before we knew it it was dinner time. We stayed then had dessert. I live everything about this restaurant. You must check out the restrooms!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars with the desserts being the better menu items. The Salt River Bars and eclairs are fantastic. Skip the tempting looking cinnamon roll, because while as large as a plate, it was dry. I am more of a gooey cinnamon roll person.

A cool, hip place to hang with your buddies and eat decent food. The lines can be very long on the weekends. Go for dessert, those are worth the wait."}
{"text":"I consider myself fortune to live close enough to Liberty Market that I can visit often. In fact, I've been having breakfast here once a week for almost year. It's a fabulous ritual in my life.

This place is just what they say, an unpretentious bistro. The food is amazing made with high quality ingredients that takes a flavor twist on traditional.

My favorite breakfast is the demi that I order with a pancake (usually with a seasonal option), 2 scrambled eggs and a sausage link. Add to that a great house cup of coffee and I'm in heaven. 

I sometimes order the cordatito from the E-61 coffee bar. it's a few sips of heaven if you love spicy coffee.

I often stop by for either the burger or pizza of the week for lunch. They are always delicious and sometimes they are intoxicating. My favorite burger is the dragon burger, which adds barbecue and slaw with an asian sauce. I do a little dance when I see it is back on the menu for the week.

If you love scones, you need to try their blueberry scone. And try any of their desserts. Oh, and don't forget to try the sweet potato salad--it's amazing, too. 

In fact, I'm sure that anything you order will be amazing. So what are you waiting for? Get yourself to Liberty Market."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal. I had the seeet potato hash which has a nice kick to it. I thought it was really flavorful. The chocolate chip pancake my friends so. Got were also delicious! The coffee was okay."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly service, clean environment

the food here always has a way of helping me feel light and weightless even though the portions are extremely big. Everything i've tried has been delicious and up to par with the ratings this place gets on yelp.

I have yet to try any of their desserts though but trust me, it was really hard resisting the temptation of their display case. Cant wait to go back and recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had the special burger at Liberty Market. The place inside is gorgeous and clean, and set up like a bistro. i didn't  get the impression that this was a restaurant that perhaps the way Olive Garden is setup, yet the prices are in line with it.

The burgers were very tasty and I liked free drink refills

The tab for my friend and I for lunch with 2 drinks was $30. That's too steep for a lunch in a place that is more like a bistro than a more formal sit-down restaurant. If it weren't for the pricing i'd bump up to 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"High prices, and for foods that I could make exactly the same as home. Food is fairly good however and the restaurant is nice. Eh."}
{"text":"I am so lucky to have a yummy and cute restaurant like Liberty Market in my neighborhood. 

I have been there quiet a few times and they never disappoint. The food is always wonderful and the service is too. The guy that works the coffee bar is so great, helpful and makes awesome almond milk lattes. 

Anytime we have people visiting or someone new in town we take them over to Liberty Market. It's just one of those places everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that! 

Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).

Nice laid back decor too.

You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!

I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!

The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)

I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!"}
{"text":"The stand out part of my Liberty Market experience was the espresso bar. They have quality, semi-automatic equipment, trained baristas, and most importantly - freshly roasted coffee that isn't too dark. They offer a french roast for some of their drinks because, as Starbucks knows, if you add a lot of milk and/or flavorings, a medium roast coffee gets lost. But for my double shot, it was nice to get a Full City roast of something that wasn't in a warehouse for months."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices.I much prefer Joe's Farm grill because the food choices for me are better, this is a nice change once in awhile."}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air! Finally, a market concept done RIGHT! Awesome branding, excellent design, friendly staff. I felt so at home! The food was amazing: fresh deli turkey, cranberry, Brie with a light tang of horseradish. And the sweet potato salad was a great new try. 

I love how every detail was addressed: well, but not oversized coffee mugs, great china, even the beverage station had the perfect set of utensils for my self-service coffee. 

One critique would be breakfast. It ends at 11a on weekdays and 1p on weekends. As an avid breakfast all-day advocate, this disappoints me. Think about extending those hours! LGO did it with great success. 

Overall, HUGE fan. If you haven't gone, check it out!!"}
{"text":"We went during the week to eat breakfast. We arrived at 10:50 and we were to late. They had already stopped serving breakfast. So we ordered lunch 1 hamburger and fries, and a single pizza. The hamburger was tiny for a $15 hamburger, the fries looked like they had been sitting in oil for a while. We didn't get the fries until we were almost done with our meal. The pizza was ok. It was the only decent part of the meal:/. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Super fun place to eat. I had a wonderful omelet. Loved the atmosphere. I will go back soon!"}
{"text":"There has NEVER been a bad experience at Liberty Market, the staff, the atmosphere but above all the White Pizza has been calling my name for over 5 years now. 

If you've never been you need to. If you haven't eaten the White Pizza, you're missing out on a whole new delicious life experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a piece of carrot cake to go.  Not impressed. The icing was very heavy on butter and the cake was extra oily,  presumably to keep it most for longer.  However,  I will come back and try their food and then update my review... But for now,  skip the cake!"}
{"text":"First time here with my family and the place and food are amazing in both sight smell and taste Nice service lots of smiles Sweet young lady helped me to put together my order Food came fast hot and appealing to the eye Didnt want the chips manager easily let me chsnge for potato salad Overall worth every perny  for a family of 4 .....5 stars"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's my favorite date spot. If I am just getting dessert and coffee or diner , I always leave happy. Service is perfection and prices are good. The restaurant is extra cute inside to boot."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday morning at about 9:30. At the time it wasn't that busy, the restaurant was about half full and there was only one couple ahead of me at the counter when I ordered. I was there with my family of 4.

The Good
 - The restaurant was immaculate. Very clean and modern looking. Its a cool place.
 - The staff is very friendly. 

The Bad
 - So... very.... slow....
I'm not sure if she was new but the lady taking orders at the front counter was PAINFULLY slow. Watching her take the order of the couple of ahead of me was a lesson in patience. When it was my turn to place an order the experience was only slightly better.

Once my order was taken it took more than 10 minutes just to get our Cinnamon Roll.. and it was cold! They didnt even take a moment to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds.

It took another 15 plus minutes beyond that for us to get our breakfast. By that time it had been more than 25 minutes since I ordered and my kids were bouncing out of their chairs with boredom. Considering how slow it was when we placed our order that is just WAY TOO LONG to wait for food.

The Eh..
The food was alright. If I take into consideration it cost $30 dollars it was a pretty poor experience. But on its own merit, the food was no better than OK. My biscuits and gravy were cold, the pancakes might have been OK but the syrup was terrible. 

Frankly, given the standards for great food set by Joe's across the street I expected way better and next time I'll just wait in line for the Farmhouse next door."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the boss lady, I am talking about my real boss not the girlfriend, the other day for lunch. We were in the middle of Mesa and overcome by corporate restaurants so I turned to Yelp as my foodie Northern Star to lead us safely! 

All the reviews raved about this place and I would agree. Now I have to admit I am kind of a Scottsdale snob, the only reason I go below the 202 is for work. So I already had a pessimistic attitude about finding a good place to eat in Mesa/Gilbert that wasn't Joe's. I am glad to say I was  wrong. 

We got there right at noon and the crowd wasn't that bad. The first thing that hits you is the cool hipster vibe they have going in there. Great layout clean and very inviting. Next step you grab a menu decide what you want pay then find your own seats.

I went with the Turkey Sandwich with blue cheese caramelized pecans onions on sourdough. It was pretty good. The turkey was moist and the toppings all worked well with each other. But it could have used MORE turkey and the bread was a little dry. I think next time I would go with the burger or chicken sandwich everyone raves about on here. 

Overall a great diner that I would go back to and drive somewhat out of the way for!"}
{"text":"We went to Liberty Market today and the food and experience was wonderful!   The staff was all very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had good service.  We ordered two pizzas, a sandwich and a couple side salads.  Everything was delicious and fresh!  We actually took to the food to go and ate outside by the water fountains and grass.  It was a perfect way for our family of 5 to spend a Sunday!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is awesome.  The ambiance is clear and special - open and inviting.  The menu is full of tantalizing and tempting meals, simple and just enough food to fill the belly and leave a smile on my face.

I had the caprese sandwich and hummus.  The sandwich was layered and full, but not overwhelming.  There was just enough balsamic to tease my palate and make me want more!

I hope to return on a day that I can lounge a bit over coffee and dessert rather than hurry a bit through lunch.  I cannot wait to tackle one of the mouthwatering red velvet cake slices..."}
{"text":"The White Pizza is a must try!! It's one of the restaurant's customer favorites and it tastes amazing. The pizza has chicken, bacon, cheese, arugala, and an amazing garlic parmesan buttery sauce. It wasn't too rich at all and is something I've never tried before. Unfortunately I can't really say the same thing for their Hollywood Cobb salad which was very mediocre and nothing mind blowing. The atmosphere is great and is somewhere you can just sort of hang out. It has a relaxed feel to it and I really like the lighting and simple interior design. For a simple and fun date I recommend this place for the single guys out there. It's a loud and busy place but not to the point where you can't hear each other talking. Also, their red velvet cake is really good. The moist cake and the delectable cream cheese frosting blend together nicely to make a perfectly sweet dessert."}
{"text":"A little pricy but you get what you pay for.  Fresh food great service.  It does get crowded but I have had braekfast and lunch here and both are very good."}
{"text":"I went during dinner rush and it was the worse mistake of my life. I was told that there was a shorter line near the bar area (?) after I finished ordering. SO TIP: You can order at the bar!

I had ordered what was their special pizza of the week/day and it came out pretty fast. It was a very standard white chicken pizza in my opinion. My problem with the pizza was that the dough in the center tasted a little undercooked. It was still doughy and it felt like it could have been left in the oven for another minute or two. I think that because of how busy it was, they were pumping out food as fast as possible and so quality slipped. Overall, I felt like that the food didn't match the price you paid. While I'm sure everything was locally source and whatnot, for what you pay you expect better and I also expect them to have more than 2 cashiers working during dinner rush. One of the girls working the cashier was also doing wine and for what you expect and pay, you should have more cashiers to check people out. The wait should NOT be more than 20 mins. 

Eh, not impressed."}
{"text":"GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME...you know what just give me Liberty Market and call it good.  You can keep that death thing.

I love the design here - very fresh.  I especially liked the bathrooms.  Liberty Market has cool bathrooms.  There, I said it.  900 reviews and I've never talked about cool bathrooms before.  Liberty Market may have some of the coolest bathrooms in the valley.

We met friends & fellow Yelpers Kevin H & Marian H for dinner here last Sunday.  The wonderful Audrey & I decided to share a burger and a pizza.  The burger was juicy and tasty.  The pizza was about a 10\" pie in the hand-tossed rustic style.  Very good.

We finished off with a  slice of red velvet cake to share.  We couldn't finish it.  Some of the cake and a slice of pizza made it home to be devoured by the kids.

Liberty Market has a nice relaxing atmosphere that is a little hard to pin down.  It's not fine dining but it feels pretty upscale considering you order cafeteria style.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really great! Burgers are really good! My favorite is the chicken pasta. Chicken bacon cheese deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea...
I've dined here many moons ago and remembered liking it.   However,  today was not the same. They have a fairly efficient oder line with great customer service. After ordering you go to an assigned table and wait for your food.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and was not impressed. They were bland and pasty.  I ordered a side of bacon and it came with a side of grease... this can be expected,  but when yiu only have one napkin and no true server, it's a compromise to dab it off...
My husband ordered the demi breakfast - it was tiny! Looked like 1 scrambled egg, a biscuit and 1! Sausage link.  :( disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and convenient downtown Gilbert location - Joe Johnson doesn't make many mistakes with his concepts, and once again, he has tapped into the right mix of flavor & style."}
{"text":"There is no other place like liberty market! We come here every Saturday! 
The pasta is amazing and they honestly have the beat coffee around!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the vibe of the restaurant is very cool. However food portions are small for the price, otherwise I'd definitely give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I met a colleague for lunch and we sat on the patio. We came at the tail end of the lunch rush. Little bit of a wait. Order taker was super personable and friendly. Ice cream cookie sandwich was amazing! I want another one already!"}
{"text":"Lot's of great selections - my only main issue is that it's gets packed but hey, you can't blame them if they're doing great in business! :)"}
{"text":"Have only been for breakfast, but every time I go.... it's worth the long wait!  Have tried many items off the breakfast menu and each one does not disappoint.  I only wish they had more seating for less of a wait time but they have a good system down to get you seated after you've ordered."}
{"text":"Takes forever to get decent and overpriced food. The potatoes are done in a large batch so no matter what you order you get the same side. Foods is ok,  but I don't understand the draw. 
2 trips ago I had to ask for a new seat because a woman was breast feeding right in front of me.  The line to order requires standing. Last time 6 people \"joined\" A group of 2 in front of us in line and added 20 minutes to our already 30 minute wait.  The staff allows this,  which is baffling. 
3 star.  Food at a slow pace with decent food.  Apparently the blueberry scones are great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. but it just falls short. I went here on a sunday morning, it was packed (obviously.) The concept seems pretty good.. upscale, fresh \"cafeteria\" style food. I waited for about 40 minutes in a long line, which takes you past premade food and tempts you to order more. The staff was nice, approached us several times to make sure we knew how to order and how the menu works. The food was expensive for what it was. I got a vegetable panini and it was OK. Ingredients were fresh but just seemed so uninspired. Something about this place left me feeling irritated and kind of angry when I left. Would prefer not to go back here ever."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. They have an excellent Italian salad that will satisfy your hunger. I've never had something I didn't enjoy. For dessert, my wife and I always enjoy the ice cream cookie sandwich."}
{"text":"What a great experience! We were looking for an outdoor patio that was dog friendly on a hot afternoon. We found these guys and decided to see how it would go. Before we were even seated a smiling server from inside the restaurant met us at the table with a doggie water bowl. Awesome.
We proceeded to order a couple of Irish Coffees to get us started while we waited for our burgers and beers. 
The burgers were incredible- juicy, thick and flavorful, and served with delicious condiments. 
Beer was  cold. Cold beer on a hot day, need not be anything else really. 
Service was outstanding. The line inside to order was a little bit long, but worth the wait- it's a busy place with steady traffic.

All-in-all, quite deserving of a 5-star rating. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am speechless that I have not written a review for this awesome place. It is one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. You just can't go wrong with it. The service is great, I love the casual yet not too casual feel of the place, and I love the menu. I have been here for lunch and dinner and both times I have left with a happy full belly. I have tried their sandwiches, burgers, and pizzas. All were fantastic. I love their side sweet potato salad. Their desserts are the size of your head. I have a feeling the cinnamon bun is bigger actually. The prices are super reasonable for a quality and delicious meal. This is a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great!  Something for everybody.  It's always crowded which should tell you something.......\"it's good\""}
{"text":"First timers so it quick, easy and delicious. Service at the bar was great. We don't live in the area but will be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in Arizona.  We had a great time eating lunch in the really lovely place.  Joe who owns the place chatted us up and was just great.  He made us a great expresso drink and charmed everyone at the table.  It felt like I was in LA or San Francisco.  What a great little place!!! I only get to AZ a few times a year but will make a effort to stop by every time."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday for dinner and the dining area was full.  I assumed the food was good as it was quite busy. The vibe is casual, but they serve great food. You order at the counter, pick up a table number, and they deliver food to you at the table of your choice. I had the steak with chimichurri and it was mouthwatering. Definitely a must try in this cute, upcoming, trendy location!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The only drawback is the parking which can get a little harry down there but it's worth it to visit all the fun little establishments especially Liberty. It can get busy during lunch so be prepared to wait in a line. They do get you in pretty quick and the service is good! Love the margarita pizza, all of their sandwiches are good and the fresh salads are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Weird that as you wait in line to place order that they assign you a a table, but their system works.

Atmosphere is nice.  Food was good.  My wife got a fancy grilled cheese.  I got a pizza and our kid got a burger.

The unisex restroom took me by surprise."}
{"text":"This place is great, a true American breakfast joint. It looks as if it is family owned and some of them work here, which gives it a small town feel, yet it seems to be a pretty popular place in old Downtown Gilbert. We've been here a few times for Sunday b-fast. The styling of the place is true old-meets-new theme, which is pretty cool. 

Everything on there menu that we've had seems to be made of quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. The service is generally pretty good, we've had less-than-perfect service a couple times, but it's usually pretty good. They source there sausage products from Shriner's locally, which is great sausage. Their biscuit's and gravy are seriously some of the best you will ever have, the Turkey sausage is excellent and if you didn't know it was turkey, you would still think it is excellent sausage. The cheesy-potatoes (can't remember what they call them!) are usually amazing but we have noticed some times they are better than others.

My wife enjoys there espresso drinks, but they don't offer anything besides whole milk, and early on a Sunday we try to keep it light. Their brewed coffee is good as well. The only limitation they may have is the menu, there is not much other than basic breakfast combos and omelets, which are all great, but it would be nice to see sandwiches and other options. They do have an assortment of baked goods, which look amazing. They only offer scrambled egg's, which I like, but my wife likes her egg's over easy and she doesn't get that option.

Overall, for a great breakfast experience, Liberty Market is one of the best, EVER! The only place that may be better is Sugar Shack in Huntington Beach, CA. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the east valley."}
{"text":"So many people are in love with this place, and I guess I'll throw my hat into the ring.

The food is always amazing. The pizzas are great (and the perfect size for 1 while still sharing a slice), the burgers fantastic (be on the lookout for their burger of the week - always especially good), and their breakfast is wonderful. I'm usually here for breakfast, my favorite dish being the western scramble. (if you like horseradish.. just trust me on this. Don't even bother looking at the rest of the menu.)

Couple of things that i think sets this place apart; you can tell they use fresh ingredients and cook from scratch. Their breakfast potatoes are more than just plain diced, unseasoned squares, and the fresh, always soft-&-warm biscuit they serve with most of their (breakfast) entrees. Also, the staff is always amazingly friendly.

I wasn't a big fan initially of their style of  \"order at the counter and find a seat,\" but they do a good job of finding & having a table ready for you by the time you get your order in, and I don't mind getting up to get my own coffee / water / iced tea. Just be aware if it's you're first time in. It can be confusing to the uninitiated. (I came here the first time with my parents and grandparents... and my grandparents were completely confused as to how the system worked. And I wasn't too sure either) Also, if you walk in with just 1 or 2 of you, there's often room at the coffee bar, and you can sit over there, skip the line, and order from the barista.

one last tidbit; their espresso is pretty great. Ordered a vanilla latte with breakfast the last time i was in, and it was fantastic. Which sucks, because now I'll have to order it all the time...

UPDATE: 2-3 weeks ago i wrote an updated review pointing out that they refused to serve eggs that weren't scrambled, which bothered me a little. I recently received a message that they've since changed their policy on this point, and are serving eggs as the customer requests, which is very welcome. (unless it's specifically a \"scramble\" dish.)"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, the staff's attentive, the place is always clean. The location is great, too. My favorite item here has to be from their breakfast menu. The Chilaqules with chorizo are very good. A little spicy but not too bad. Baked goods are great also."}
{"text":"Love going here for Saturday Brunch. The eggs are delicious and the sticky bun is as big as your face and sooooo good! Also love that they have seating assistance. Good food, friendly staff, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I am going to try to keep this short because I could easily go on and on about how good this place is. Service, food, decor all excellent.  Everyone else who is offering reviews is doing a nice job of talking about the food so I am going to mention a few different items of interest.  But about the food I will just quickly mention if you are having breakfast it may sound unusual but get the meatball as a side dish. It blew me away. 
Not only does Liberty market offer Gilbert residents quality food, they do it at a reasonable price.  For a long time the Johnson family has been giving away free meals once a year at their flagship restaurant Joe's BBQ, right across the street.  In keeping with that tradition of bringing residents together they are offering a \"Community Dinner\" at Liberty.  The concept being that 30 residents can sign up for a dinner consisting of 5 or more courses including a chef's surprise course.  All for one very affordable price. The community part is that they sit you at a table of 6 or so offering diners an opprutunity to get aquinted with thier neighbors.  The dinner is limited to just 30 people on a frist come, first serve basis. Wonderful idea.  Earlier I was bragging about how good the meatball's are. I understand they have a Meatball sandwich which is not on the menu. Also not on the menu is a breakfast burger which is only served on the week ends between 11 and 1.  Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me.  While I was leaving I was looking at the pictures on the wall and I noticed that the family was pictured outside of the famous Culinary Institute of America Greystone.   I noticed that my waiter was pictured and after tracking him down again I find out that he was a family member, Willie Johnson, how unpretentious.  So that explains some of the good food. They have a strong background."}
{"text":"I have been to Liberty Market a few times. I truly don't understand the hype. I had a salad and couldn't finish it. The desserts are not that special either. 
I do have to say the coffee is the only good thing going for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. We had a a Hollywood Cobb salad with salmon and the daily burger special.
The bill was over $35... The was ok but nothing special. The prices were outrageous. The Cobb salad was actual small with little ingredients. Salmon was an additional $5. The atmosphere was ok but not plush for the prices. Next time I'll go to Zupas and save $15 with a much better salad for sure.
Much too pricey even if they are in Old Town Gilbert."}
{"text":"Another long day - clinic all morning, lunch at Barrio Café, and a late dinner at Kai - yet the morning routine would repeat itself again with a great twelve mile run around Kierland making me wish every hour of every day was like Phoenix before dawn.  Showered and refreshed by the in-room Starbucks Africa Kitamu and readied for another long day of eating, sightseeing, eating, hockey, and eating I made my way to the car and set my GPS for the town of Gilbert; destination Liberty Market, home of what many (including the local paper) have noted to be the best Bread Pudding around.

A functioning grocery since 1935 and located in a building under a water tower every bit showing its age I approached Liberty Market slowly due to the local farmer's market - a market containing much of what has now been out of season in Ohio for at least a month - and with parking readily available I made my way into Liberty Market via the side door.  Passing the al fresco dining area, the kitchen, and subsequently the store and pastry counter to take my place in a line six deep I grabbed a paper menu on the way in to browse though in all reality it was not really necessary; I knew what I was there for and the pastry case had already tempted me with any number of appetizers.  

Standing in line while others made their decisions, some a full meal and some merely pastries to go, when I eventually reached the coffee bar I was greeted by a young man with spacers and sleeves to fit his blasé demeanor and placing my order the price was recited and a number was handed to me with any number of seats to choose from both inside and out.  Opting this time for the indoors and filling a glass with water and ice I took a seat with a full view of the room and placing my number on the table was left to wait for perhaps 10 minutes while reading a local guidebook detailing Liberty's history as well as  the other restaurants in Joe Johnston's stable.

Sipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12\" by 12\"plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or, if you're feeling truly ravenous (gluttonous) to enjoy on your own.

With the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing, but alas it was merely very good.  Served with real maple syrup and approximately half the size and twice the weight of the cinnamon roll the bread pudding was in reality nearly flawless French Toast - a caramelized exterior and a moist custard interior, but what he had in texture it unfortunately lacked in taste.  Largely eggy but also with slight notes of cinnamon and vanilla that perked up with the syrup perhaps part of my disillusionment with the pudding was actually how sweet its predecessor had been but overall it just felt like something was missing - perhaps some fruit, whipped cream, or caramelized nuts to add a bit of texture and nuance (this is apparently how they serve the dessert, non-griddled, bread pudding.)

Overall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes, plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert."}
{"text":"So much YUM and so much atmosphere - this is a true gem in the Gilbert downtown area. Its worth every second!"}
{"text":"I went there last Thursday for breakfast with a friend. I love the area and the décor of the restaurant. I ordered the Sicilian Scramble. I thought the portion was a little small to be honest. It tasted good, didn't really blow me away. Like previous reviews mention is the time it takes to get your food. It was a Thursday morning at 8:30 am, there was 1 couple in line in front of us when we ordered. After finding a table, I noticed every table had a number on it, meaning they were still waiting for their food. It probably took a little over 20 minutes to get our food. If you're in a hurry I would not recommend this place. I will return but I think they should find a way to speed up service. I did take a look in the kitchen and it looked like there was only 2 chiefs in the kitchen, that could be the problem."}
{"text":"The worst format for a restaurant.  You walk in and... well, figure it out.  I guess you're supposed to pick up a menu and then walk to the far side of the place and order.  Not that you'd know that, or even that the place was a restaurant.  I thought it was a market.

Since you order and pay at a register, you'll have to wait in line to put in an order.  Figure an extra 10-30 minutes of waiting over any other restaurant.  And the parking outside says 20 minutes only.  Well played.

I had a sandwich and it was pretty good.  The pasta salad was bad.

The prices are fitting of a nice sit-down restaurant, but it is a self-serve place.  Hipster heaven.  Not only is it counter intuitively named and designed, but it's also expensive!  Woo!  They probably have a secret menu I wasn't cool enough to know about."}
{"text":"First one in, then 10 minutes later, everyone else in the world came in.  With good reason.  For my first time I chose the chefs breakfast sandwich with a salad.  Though there were 2 or 3 minor minor points I could explain, not everyone is a hypercritical dbag like me, so let's let the overall experience take the lead, and that was a great one.  Come in, order at the counter, and have a good meal.  Look for me, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place in Gilbert for breakfast. Fresh ingredients, open kitchen and a LONG line. I recommend splitting the breakfast quesadilla (it's very filling). And if the line discourages you, look forward to the unlimited coffee refills."}
{"text":"Great food!  Everything is fresh and prepared on site which is important to me.  They are fast at lunch time and everything I have ordered has been outstanding."}
{"text":"I really loved this place and ate my dinner like it was going out of style. The beer was good and the food had excellent flavor. We had a great time eating with friends on the patio and my daughter loved watching the chefs through the huge kitchen windows."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! I have been twice and have yet to have bad food!!!! It's a little different in that you go up to the counter and order your food, then you go sit down. During busy times there is a waiter/waitress that will give you a number and put that number on a table for you. I can't wait to come back and try ALL THE THINGS!!!"}
{"text":"Came into town for my annual work meeting and was excited to try some local eats! I decided to give Liberty Market a try as I was already a huge fan of Joe's Farm Grill. This place also offered tasty, unique but yet affordable meals. I ordered the ever popular picnic sandwich, which did not disappoint. I chose the sweet potato salad which I do not regret! It was by far the most amazing sweet potato salad ever!! I was impressed by the great, attentive and fast customer service. Plenty of seating and fast service even during lunch hour!"}
{"text":"It's like a cafeteria. You order your food in the front, they give you a number and they deliver it to your table (a bit like panera bread).

Their Best Chicken Sandwich, is not so much a sandwich but a grilled chicken burger with lettuce, tomato, red onions, avocado, and some sort of amazing dressing that made the entire thing mouth-watering. $10 is not cheap for this dish, but it's GIGANTIC and delicious (comes with chips).

I also couldn't help but order their giant red velvet cake with cream cheese icing. The size of it is bigger than my FACE, and it was so good that i probably could have finished it all if i didn't stop myself. I gave most of the cake away to our foreign guests from Argentina, who's never tried red velvet before. They couldn't finish it but ended up taking it back to their hotel because it was so good. 

It's unfortunate that their line is so long all the time, but that really speaks for how good the food is here."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is one of my absolute favorite places to have a lunch with friends or dinner with family in Downtown Gilbert, because the menu options are so diverse & the coffee bar is incredible. Coquitos are a fantastic shot of caffeine and an energy boost for my day, and they're served up by the baristas at Liberty at an affordable price. The restaurant is always clean, the food is always served up quickly and the location is convenient. The restaurant also features an expansive dessert menu, which you might not be able to resist as you go through the line to order your meal. Check out the cinnamon rolls: they are literally the size of a plate of food but probably worth your splurge on a cheat day."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is a wonderful restaurant run by absolutely great people. Kiersten and her husband (lead chef) Dave do their best to keep things running smoothly, but always have time to chat with you and genuinely listen to you. They're very passionate about delivering a great experience, and it shows, as Kiersten is there at all hours, on nearly every shift.

Joe Johnston, the other partner (of Joe's Real BBQ fame) is tremendously friendly as well and usually behind the coffee bar, engaging customers and trying new things.

Now to the food:

Everything is quite fantastic. The grilled cheese was long my favorite, as simple as it sounds, with a bit of mayo and several cheese and a nice tomato, grilled perfectly and served with one of their great side salads--I always go with the caprese pasta salad.

The burger is delicious. The rancher sandwich has a piece of filet with carmelized onion and arugula and is just amazing.

Breakfast is great too. Really, there's nothing bad I can say about the food--my only feedback is that I'd love to see everything about a buck cheaper.

Their minestrone soup is incredible, for someone who doesn't even like minestrone, and their meatballs are great as well.

If you're there and enjoying yourself, take a trip to the bathrooms. On the way, you'll see the kitchen, through large plate glass windows, and each of the four bathrooms are designed by one of the partners for their own unique flair. Definitely a fun touch to a great dining experience. 

It's a bit of a drive if you're not on this side of the Valley, but it's really great food and a great price served by great people, all around."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We have never had a bad experience here. They have a really good coffee bar as well. I have only tried 3 different things on the menu, but so far, all have been fantastic."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.

My wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.

I was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.

While we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.

My cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.

The cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.

The saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.

Their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?

Sorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 5 times.  Ok for lunch, will never go back for breakfast.  Huge disappointment! Bad, cold food. 30 dollars for 2 people for bfast is crazy, not to mention its cafeteria style so you get NO SERVICE, for 30 bucks....no thanks."}
{"text":"I'm a big Liberty Market fan and way overdue on this review. 

I'm also a big Joe Johnston fan. Think he's a great guy & love that he's about great AZ food, drink, coffee & gelato/ice cream - and not just his own stuff.

I've been to Liberty Market a host of times and enjoyed it each one. This past one, I went by for EVTM (East Valley Thursday Morning) and hung out with 40-50 friends & strangers.

I ate breakfast at LM for the first time and it was stellar. I got the demi-breakfast (scrambled eggs, meatball & pancake) and a bowl-a-ccino. The giant bowl of cappuccino was excellent, as is all the coffee I've had there. It was quite pretty as well with a very nice pour. 

I thought the food was remarkable too - especially the scrambled eggs which were perfectly done (little bit soft) and the meatball (was hint of wonderful cheese in it - Parmigiano-Reggiano or something similar?). Super yum. While I thought the pancake was great as well, the other 2 were the standouts for me.

I also love the decor & ambiance of LM. I love how casual it is and how easy it is to feel comfortable with your family & friends. I think the ordering mechanics lend to that - you order at the counter & take your number to a table of your choice.

The building just reeks of character, with exposed brick and is beautifully decorated in kind of a retro vibe. The bathrooms are also very cool.

In past visits we've also had the meatballs, the rancher sandwich and some of the pizzas, which were all excellent.

If LM wasn't so far from our house, I know with certainty that it would be one of our regular haunts."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Chef David really loves what he does and the staff is great. They even adjust order for me to make them weight watchers friendly which is great.  Only drawback, they need more scooter parking. :-)"}
{"text":"I mean srsly... who doesn't love a communal wash area?!

Liberty Market is easily not only my favorite East Valley Eatery, but just plain hang out spot. The wifi, quality coffee, smiling employees and friendly service are only a fraction of what makes this place awesome. It's attention to detail, delicious eats and creative vibe are second to none. I deeply appreciate how involved they are in the community, and the owner Joe is always a tweet or email away and always has a smile and something nice to say.

I look back fondly on my unemployed summer of '09 as much of it was spent drinking soy lattes at the E61 bar and chatting it up with friends over salads and desert at Liberty Market. 

Joe, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I honestly came here for the coffee. When I was looking at the menu I just did not know what to get. I felt like their lunch menu was overpriced. 

We decided to share the Salmon BLT, one caramel latte and one regular coffee. All together that was $23. The sandwich was a very small portion with a very thin piece of salmon. Don't get me wrong, it tasted really good but the serving sizes were not large. 

Liberty market has a cool atmosphere, very trendy and modern. But this place just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"This place really fell off for us with this last visit. We tried all new things and they were all terrible.

Sicilian pizza was awful.

Burger of the day was tasteless.

Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Bacon was the bed thing by far and it was just ok.

The Sweet Potato side dish that everyone seemed to be getting was awful. What was in that beets and raspberries?? Eugh

Disappointing visit. We usually love this place."}
{"text":"LOVE AT FIRST TASTE.

Came here after a long hike for Sunday Brunch and we definitely dodged the rush. After we sat down, I saw a line forming out the door. 

Enter through the \"back\" door (the one NOT facing the street), the hostess will greet you there and give you a number which will match your table. You then stand in line to order, then go find your numbered table. 

I ordered the sweet potato chorizo hash with the monkey bread. Oh my Lord, it was aaaamazing! The runny sunny side yolks mixed with the salty chorizo and some onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños made it perfect. The monkey bread was toasty warm. Biscuits covered in brown sugar and drizzled with cream cheese icing. The food was a lot more filling than I thought it would have been.  

Can't complain too much -- service was helpful and attentive. ambiance was casual, urban warehouse, a little loud. food was outstanding. The only thing I wish, is that my order wasn't $25 :( 

Environment: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Price: 4/5

{"text":"Food was amazing, chicken pasta and bread pudding, made perfect! The staff was extremely friendly and always ready to help. Would recommend"}
{"text":"The menus for breakfast and lunch are both great!!    Food was Amazing, staff and service were Amazing.  The Manager who checkup up on our large group regularly was the best.   I won't say it's cheap but you get what you pay for and this place is truly worth every penny.   Will return!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Had breakfast here - really nice shady patio and delicious, fresh food with quality ingredients. The smashed meatball and the pork verde were very good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! food is always excellent!  Best Cortado!!"}
{"text":"badass building. even cooler signage. need more stuff to sell. food was good..not sure i would drive the 30 miles to get there super often but worth it to see the history of that place and the owners seem to know quality. Tons of cool touches here and there..loved it. A bit too slick in parts..but dang...gilbert got some cool up in their piece. 

ps. need more than one person ringing on saturday morning."}
{"text":"This place always has plenty of delicious options! The food is always delicious and I love the ambiance. The coffee bar is amazing. I'll even come in just for coffee, after eating elsewhere in the Downtown Gilbert area. The place can get a tad noisy and crowded but that's how all the restaurants in that area are."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here a few weeks ago with our daughter. The atmosphere is neat. I am not a huge fan of the cafeteria style line, especially if you have little ones. Also, they do not have a kids menu so keep that in mind.

I got a steak, which was delicious with great flavor. My husband got a pizza with white sauce and we also got my daughter a cheese pizza. All of the food was good, and my daughter actually liked my husbands pizza more than her own, which was a nice surprise. We then had dessert, which we thankfully ordered while in line the first time. We had a Guinness cupcake and a Salt River Bar. The cupcake was good, nothing amazing, but the Salt River Bar was fantastic.

I also love that they have drinks that are made and bottled ahead of time, so when you order one it comes right up in its own bottle. And the drinks I had (I can't remember which ones they were) were great.

And, I love the bathroom there. I hate when you go to a cool place and go to the bathroom only to find that they have put zero effort into making it nice. It is a coed bathroom so keep that in mind, but it has closed off stalls so no worries. 

We will be going back, maybe when it's just my husband and I."}
{"text":"The place gets pretty crowded. The people working there were friendly. I tried one of their favorites - Picnic with sweet potato salad. The sandwich was very good. The salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at Liberty Market. They have an excellent selection of non-meat items."}
{"text":"I have been a customer at Liberty for years! Highlights are the Salmon BLT, cuban, the sea bass special, coffee bar and my all time fave dessert there the Salty Bar. I remember a while back I was craving the salty bar, chocolate, peanut butter pastry with sea salt on top...they just closed up and I pressed my little face begging them to let me buy a salty bar even for $20! The owner opened the door and gave me a corner piece on the house. THIS WAS CHRISTMAS to me. The coffee bar is our favorite place to take out-of-towners as they have very tasty espresso or Vietnamese iced coffees. We love downtown Gilbert but Liberty makes the top of the list."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went here before seeing a show at Hale Theater. They have amazing food and a great choices of beer or wine. The manger even walked by to see if everything was okay. We told him the food was wonderful but we were bummed the line had become so long because we wanted dessert and a coffee to take to the theater but we didn't have time to wait in line, he ended up taking our order and payment right there and getting us our treats and coffee in time to make our show!"}
{"text":"Friend: \"I'm going to pick Liberty Market for our dinner club this month\"
Me: \"OMG! I LOVE Liberty Market!\"
Friend: \"I love it too! So you've been there?\"
Me: \"Uh, well, no. It just seems like the type of place I know I'm going to love.\"

I was right. Cool ambiance, awesome food choices, and fantastic service... is it possible to have a crush on a restaurant? It would be such a perfect place to drop by for brunch or lunch, but sadly, it's about 30 miles away for me. Sigh. 

David, the executive chef and co-owner of Liberty Market took care of us - what a cool guy. I just read his bio on Liberty Market's website and he's had quite a history. His collaboration with Joe (of Joe's Family Farm and Joe's BBQ) made some magic.

I shared sandwiches with a friend, so I could try two. I had the Maiden Lane (turkey, brie, red cabbage slaw, cranberry, and a horseradish aioli). I really liked the combo of the cranberry with horseradish. It definitely has a kick to it. I also had half of The Farmer (roasted veggies, grilled sweet potato, and goat cheese). Loved all the veggies! Note: make sure you like goat cheese because there's a generous amount (Another friend got it sans cheese and liked it a lot). I also had the sweet potato salad on the side - delicious!

We couldn't leave without trying dessert. We shared carrot cake (it was very gingery which I love) and had delicious frosting. We also ordered a chocolate/peanut butter square which was a scrumptious tower of chocolate, peanut butter, and crackers sprinkled with sea salt. Bravo on the desserts!

So how about opening a Liberty Market II on the north end of the Valley?"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon them when visiting some friends.  Great food, reasonable prices and very service oriented.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food for the price.  A big breakfast fan.  Great service, always clean.  Bakery goods are awesome.  Convenient location.  A little trouble parking on weekends because of all the surrounding restaurants, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy waiting in such a long line to order and pay for my food. I wouldn't recommend going here if you're absolutely starving. If you've never been before, it's not the type of place where you walk in and get seated by a host or hostess. You walk in, grab a menu, and wait in a line until you reach the register. The part that I do like is that you can see the food being made in front of you and everything looked so good, I sort of needed the additional time to choose from all the options. I felt bad for my boyfriend because he definitely didn't expect to wait as long as we did and he looked like he was going to pass out from starvation. We hadn't eaten breakfast and it was going on lunch time. Once you pay at the resister, you can finally sit at a table, but I think the employees purposely slow the line down because they can't seat people until tables open up. We actually ordered an Oatmeal Cream Pie since we saw it in the pastry window by the register and assumed they would give it to us right away. After all, I was afraid my boyfriend was about to pass out. Unfortunately, they brought it out with the rest of the food so it was kind of a waste, but luckily it was still pretty tasty.

I decided to try the Red Bean and Rice Burger (red bean and rice patty, Cajun spices, Monterey Jack, red onion, shredded iceberg, grilled sesame roll, and dip trio). I liked the burger, but I got sick of it after a while. I think the patty is too basic and could use some vegetables or something. My boyfriend ordered from the breakfast menu even though it was after 1 pm. If you're able to grab a breakfast menu at the front and you end up getting stuck in like till after 1 pm like we did, they'll still make you breakfast which is really nice. He ordered the Smothered Breakfast Burrito (eggs, grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese, salsa casera, Liberty potatoes, flour tortilla, smothered with tomatillo and chile pequin sauce) and it was really delicious. I actually liked his meal way better than mine even though I'm usually a big fan of vegetarian burgers. Additionally, I tried the Mojito and thought it was pretty refreshing. 

I would definitely give this place another shot, but I wouldn't necessarily jump at the chance to either (mainly because of the line situation). On the other hand, some of the Yelp pictures for this restaurant look pretty enticing and I love that everything is really fresh, so it's possible I could change my mind. Their Sicilian style pizzas look pretty good and would likely be the next item on my list of things to try if I decided to go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I had lunch there today which was my 2nd visit.   I ordered the Rancher salad my first visit and it was truly delicious.  The chipotle vinaigrette and the lemon vinaigrette impressed my dining companion so much that she asked the manager if they sell it by the bottle.  Staff and service outstanding.  So I was excited to go back today for lunch and had a tough time ordering.  We went around noon (Sunday) and place was packed.  I wish I had ordered the salmon plate after observing a neighboring diner's choice.   Damn.   I can't complain though because my egg salad sandwich with pasta side was really good.  My friend ordered the Italia salad and it was fantastic.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You honestly can't go wrong with Liberty! My fav of course is their breakfast especially their Chorizo!  and make sure you have a great pick me up at their cafe. Cortaditos are my personal favs!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the food was very good.  You order and sit down, they bring it to you, can be very quick. A tad overpriced for what you get, but great food and selection."}
{"text":"We popped into liberty market on a Thursday for dinner. It's been a while since I have been back and I was truly impressed, I had to bump it up to 5 stars. ordered pizza and champagne and the Hubster ordered chicken sandwich, potato salad and a San tan epicenter beer. For dessert we shared a slice of red velvet cake and two perfect espressos.  leave room for dessert! 

Service was quick and pleasant. Love the laid back casualness of the restaurant. Even though it's laid back I still think its a nice treat and the food is so good and fresh. overall fabulous place for lunch or dinner.  Love it & that it is in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Cool place, a bit of a throw back to a less hectic time. The food is great, have a rancher with some sweet potatoe salad."}
{"text":"This is a great place,  nice open kitchen,  delicious breakfast and even a better lunch menu.  This morning my husband and i had a \"Dosant\"! Holy cow it was devine. Atmosphere is relaxed and comfy.  I have never done this. ..but if you can have the sweets first,  i highly recommend you do it.  I love this part of Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. I went on a Saturday around 1130 and stood in line for 15 minutes and then sat on the outside patio since it was a nice day.  I ordered the veggie pizza since I seen a wood fired oven with bubbly pizzas coming out.  It was hard to make a menu choice here because everything sounded so good and you could see all the fresh salad fixings and side items in the glass window display. I heard from a lot of people that everything is good here. My pizza was soooo good. The crust was thin and crispy  like I like and it had a lot of yummy roasted veggies on top. I will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for breakfast and brunch and always been happy. Finally tried the place for dinner and I'll just stick to breakfast and brunch. Husband and I ordered the ribeye special that came with asparagus, herb and garlic sauce, and horseradish mashed potatoes. I know ribeyes are a fatty steak but this cut was pretty sad. I ordered medium rare and mine was more well done than anything. 
I'll stick to the Chilaquiles with chorizo."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast - biscuits and gravy were delicious.  Large, large plates of food that barely fit on our small table.  The ice tea as fresh brewed.  We did have to wait close to an hour for a table.  The service was great but the restaurant is VERY small so I would not recommend it for large parties or small kids/toddlers."}
{"text":"Liberty is all around a rad place. Its an experience coming to this place to eat. They change their menu around often to keep is fresh and have weekend specials. Some of their plates have more food than others but overall everything is really good here. Its super clean eating and very tasty."}
{"text":"Over the last five and a half years, I've given Liberty Market several tries and sadly, I keep on being disappointed. The ingredients are good quality and one can tell that easily but the preparation of the food is mediocre at best and lackluster at its worst.

The good: 

decor, atmosphere. I love the casual feeling of the space and the fact that children are welcomed there. 

I've always been met with a friendly face and nice folks behind the counter. The employees are well-informed and eager to answer any questions one may have. 

Pleasant outdoor seating options and just a stone's throw away from the downtown Gilbert splash pad. It's a fantastic space for kids to enjoy and play around.

The bad:

Flavor profile of dishes I've tried fall flat; they're mostly one-noted. I think the head chef needs to tweak the recipes to ensure consistent quality and ability for the line cooks to be able to replicate the dish. 

I ordered a roasted chicken leg special and the meat was incredibly dry despite my attempts to drown it in the accompanying sauce. The skin was deliciously prepared - crisp, tender and flavorful. I only wished the meat would have reflected the same attention to preparation as the skin. 

The desserts are hit or miss. The last time I had their chocolate cake, it wasn't moist and sadly tasted like the fridge. I don't think it was properly stored - perhaps not wrapped? - and this was evident. 

I want to love Liberty Market; the location is fantastic, the menu is promising and it's a beautiful gem of a building in downtown."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance - sort of a casual urban chic.  Everything we ordered was so incredible!  My husband and I shared the italia salad which had artichoke hearts, arugula, sun dried tomatoes, high quality salami and basil tossed with a lemony vinaigrette - so good!  We then had a perfectly grilled  juicy, tender skirt steak with a fresh,tangy, slightly spicy chimmichurri sauce - amazing! Oh but there's more...the smashed potatoes and grilled veggies harmonized perfectly with the steak.  Topped it off with the chocolate hazelnut bread pudding covered by a huge mound of fresh fluffy whipped cream. I was so full before the desert came, but I had no trouble diving into that bowl of warm, chocolatey, custardy goodness!  DEVINE!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my sons. We ordered the tower burger,  the baby back ribs, blueberry scone and the chocolate death ray cake. The burger was cooked as specified- medium with 3 sauces and chips with sesame bun. It was very good, moist and juicy. Wish it came with fried instead. The ribs were small about 12 pieces and the sauce was too spicy, enough for 1 person. Came with cole slaw which had too much vinegar and fries. It was good but would not order it again. My son loved the scone with the clotted cream. The chocolate cake was moist and very rich, good to share. Loved the atmosphere with the neon and shopping cart decorations. It was busy but during the weekends there is reserved seats after you order. Service was good and friendly. We would go there again."}
{"text":"My family loves Liberty Market.

I really appreciate the decor of the restaurant; it's sort of a 50s style vintage that I would almost describe as \"garage\" but don't let that dissuade you from going.

My absolute favorite dish they serve is the Picnic Sandwich.  It has roasted turkey, caramelized pecans, green apple, blue cheese, greens, and roasted red pepper aioli.  Everything about it is perfect, but when you get your first bite of blue cheese and caramelized pecans you'll wonder why you don't eat that sandwich every single day of your life.

Another favorite is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb marinade.  I'm a fan of flatiron steak and anything that uses Mr. Pibb in it is good in my book.

The line to order can get pretty long at the standard meal times, especially on the weekends, but the employees do a really good job of getting you a number and assigning you a table while you're waiting.  I've never finished ordering and not had a place to go and sit down right away - no matter how busy it's been.

There is no waiter service at Liberty Market; you start by ordering your food at the register and then get your own drinks.  The food is delivered to you table by runners which is nice, but then drink refills are on your own throughout.  It's a good system that works well though.  The runners delivering the food to the table is a nice in between so you don't need to go back up to the counter after you've sat down.

Dessert is great too - we always get the Salt River Bar because chocolate and salt is a perfect combination.  They have lots of house made desserts and bakery items like red velvet cake, cinnamon rolls, scones, rice crispy treats, and cupcakes.  Definitely pick something up for dessert.

I've only mentioned lunch and dinner in this review, but Liberty Market does do breakfast which is what we go in for most often.  I don't love their breakfast selections however.  You pretty much only have a choice of variations on eggs.  The breakfast menu is not extensive or particularly interesting, but, like I said, my family and I probably go to Liberty Market for breakfast more than we do for lunch or dinner so take that for what it's worth.

Liberty Market is one of our absolute favorite restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area.  We are so lucky to have such a unique place so close by and in an area that we love visiting."}
{"text":"Day...by day...by day.  By day.  Yes, I could probably spend part of any day at this place and be content. From the java bar, to the busy but fun dining room to the relaxing patio - this place rocks!  I've been there at least a dozen times and half of those times the owner and his wife (either/or, sometimes both) are chatting it up with patrons. 

The place is unique in every way.  From the old 'market' that it used to be, to the awesome wood fired pizza oven, to the line of fresh salads, pastries and other goodies - the renowned bathrooms.  Yes, they won an award.  Oh, wait. The food.

Yeah - the food is great too.  Breakfast is killer and sure to minimize any hangover.  I've had lunch there too - believe it was the Salmon BLT.  Dinner as well - my dad, when visiting from Seattle, raved about the filet that he had.

This place will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. The food was just fine. 

We went to this place with great expectations after seeing the high ratings and also the long line to order food. The food was fine but did not live up to the expectations that I had built up in my mind. 

What I liked: I really liked three things at this place for which I would even go back to it: the chilaquiles, Cuban coffee and the chocolate death ray cake. The chilaquiles were a winner from the get go and was by far my favorite thing at this place. We ordered them with chorizo, so the combination was mind blowing. Would order this again in a heartbeat. The Cuban coffee with raw sugar in it was also very nice. The chocolate death ray was a lot of chocolate and I loved it. 

What I did not like: we tried the Crab Po-boy and it was bland and did not have a lot of taste. I love New Orleans cuisine and having wonderful poboys there might have failed this one. The best chicken sandwich also did not live up to its name. It did not have any flavor inside. 

So, the few things I liked were very good. But I would not recommend the sandwiches we tried."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some friends/co-workers.  I had the beet arugula salad, and I loved it!  Ate the entire thing.  The dressing was a sherry vinaigrette, and it was delicious.  I also tried a sweet potato muffin, and it was great.  

Service was good.  Line was long at lunch, so plan some extra time."}
{"text":"Years ago, I was deterred from visiting Liberty Market because their website loudly and proudly said, \"WE ARE CHRISTIANS.\" Also, it's in Gilbert.

Oh, how I'd deprived myself all these years.

Their pizza and salad combo is ambrosia for my soul. The salad was fresh and great, but let's talk about the pizza... oh, man. Fresh sweet ricotta, farm veggies, incredible, thick, crispy bread, and light sauce. So nice, I'd hit it twice. Or 17 million times.

The music playing inside was awesome, so were the vibes, and the staff was nice and friendly, to boot.

This area in Gilbert is really cool, but I can't will myself to branch out when I'm in the area. I've got an addiction, and the only thing that will stave off the pizzasickness is Liberty Market."}
{"text":"[Solid 3.5 but not rounding up to 4] 

I found myself randomly in Gilbert on a Saturday morning on a spontaneous mini adventure in which I allowed the universe to lead me around. By which I mean I allowed my interactions with people that morning (and the night before) guide me. A recommendation to the Gilbert Farmers Market and a growling tummy brought me here. 

I was guided to a seat at the espresso bar where I was guaranteed a seat and they would take my order directly. I didn't have to stand in line and order and then find a seat as typically directed. 

Ordering one of the \"Liberty Market Favorites\" Picnic Sandwich [roasted turkey, caramelized pecans,green apple, blue cheese, mixed greens, roasted red pepper aioli] to which I decided on a side of cucumber tomato salad with a red wine vinaigrette to accompany my choice, I waited. I watched as the line to order got long and glanced over at what my neighbors and fellow patrons were eating. Wow the portions for breakfast looked huge. 

My sandwich arrived. I was expecting more I guess. Considering all the potential layers of flavor....I took a bite. Turkey was bland but it was a generous portion. It had about the right amount of blue cheese but I could hardly detect the aioli. In hind sight I guess I could have asked for a bit more on the side. The cucumber salad was a bit bland too. Not enough vinegar for my tastes but it was fresh. 

In all I enjoyed the ambiance and the experience. I may have to try their breakfast or their pizzas next time I find myself in the area."}
{"text":"Blessed are the hipsters, for they shall inherit the Liberty Market! They bring us BeeGees blaring in the background and shopping carts as decorations.  But the cliches are forgiven. The place has style AND good food.  I ordered biscuits and gravy, a relatively difficult meal to screw up (and yet many do screw it up) and it was stylishly served and very very tasty.

Does food taste better on a square plate? Does food taste better when sitting on vinyl green booths? The answer is clearly yes....come enjoy...."}
{"text":"Went back again with the #EVFN group and had another great time.   This place is great for large groups.   Call them they can reserve some space for you and even open a register for your group if you need it.  

I really liked the ice tea and white pizza.   Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My third trip to Liberty Market, this time on a very busy Saturday. The staff does an amazing job of assisting customers, making sure you have a table assigned while you order your food, and providing prompt, friendly service. Several staff members took time to chat and share their own favorite food choices even though they were quite busy. No surprise that they all have favorites because the food here is simply delicious. I tried the chilequiles with Vietnamese coffee. Apparently I had a yen for  international things today. Great choices. The one bite I got of my friend's sticky bun was amazing, but as she was guarding it like a nervous mother hen I only managed the one bite. Next time I'm indulging in one the sweets or pastries and I am confident the quality will be exceptional just as I have come to expect at Liberty Market. Thanks for providing a fun time for us."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. They have an amazing seafood special with salmon and pasta. Mouthwatering goodness in every bite!!"}
{"text":"I go to Liberty market as often as I can. The food here is great! I've tried many things from all 3 menus and have not been disappointed by any of them! I'm now also hooked on the cortadito (sp?) because Joe bought me one just to prove how good they were! 

Everyone is always friendly and the food usually comes out fast. I really cant think of any complaints!! keep up the good work and if you have never been here, definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just had a bad experience. I split two dishes the salmon plate and the white pizza. The pizza had a lot of crust and very little everything. The pizza in the picture on here looks much better than the pizza I received. The salmon plate was good, nothing special. Definitely wouldn't get either again. I also tried the thick pizza my mom got... It looked old and tasted that way too. I have no reason to go back except to give them another shot. They have a pretty good rating so maybe I just had a bad experience. 
The salt chocolate bar was good, weird and different but good. Wouldn't get it again but good to try once. Also tried the icecream cookie. That is the only thing here I would recommend."}
{"text":"Well they do have some light breakfast for those on a diet...the salmon plate was excellent with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, and some crushed olives. Well played liberty....well played."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. It is a cool trendy place right in the heart of downtown Gilbert. First, I love that little strip of restaurants. It's a cool area to eat and hang out with Joe's Real BBQ, Oregano's, Farmhouse, etc. On the weekends there's even a little Farmer's Market with cool local finds like jalapeno brittle, flavored popcorn, and artisan crafts. 

Liberty Market is really one of a kind with great, interesting, fresh foods awesome coffee and bakery items. It is a must eat in Gilbert! Btw, check out the bathrooms! All of my friends always recommend walking in because of the cool decor! haha kind of a weird thing to say about a place but I agree it's cool! :D"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast. They had all the breakfast crowd pleasers. Portions are pretty good considering the price. This place can get busy so come early!"}
{"text":"Kristen and the rest of the Liberty Market staff were so friendly! All the food looks unreal, atmosphere is fantastic, even down to the bathrooms. Definitely stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First time here.  The guy that greeted me recommended a few things including the  the white pizza, which I ordered.  It was very nice and tasty 10\" pizza!!  Service was friendly and helpful.  I only ate part of my pizza and and asked for a togo box.  The guy forgot about it but when I went up and asked for the box, he apologize for forgetting it-not a big deal."}
{"text":"I take my hot wife here every couple months. It's a 45 minute drive from our new place, but if we lived closer we would go every week. The food is always consistent and really good. Salmon BLT is probably my favorite. Chase aka Charles (our server) was kind and the atmosphere was refreshing. The only downfall is some of the tables are really close together on the inside, so it feels like speed dating.  So if you are into that, then I would highly recommend sitting inside."}
{"text":"The first time that my husband and I visited Liberty Market we were actually trying to have breakfast next door but the line was crazy so we thought we would try this place instead.  I am SO glad that we did!  Liberty Market is now my favorite place in Gilbert for breakfast and because they are large you usually don't have to wait to long.  I absolutely love their biscuits and gravy and their liberty potatoes.  The only negative thing about them is they are a little pricey for breakfast and my husband doesn't like the fact that they only serve their eggs scrambled.  They do have plenty of outside seating, which we enjoy."}
{"text":"At first I was disappointed that the menu selection was not as large as I hoped, we shared the white pizza and Bella got a kids meal hamburger. The hamburger was huge, I would of been able to eat that size. That being said Bella only ate half and Javier and I shared the other half. The white pizza was amazing and had so much flavor. Chicken, bacon, arugula, and pine nuts were some of the toppings, and of course the cheese.  Even though it was late I wanted to try the Cortado *4 shot espresso Cuban coffee* this had so much flavor and I was impressed. And my review would not be complete if I didn't end with \"and Javier had the ice tea\" this one was freshly brewed and had a great flavor.  I would love to go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is the only restaurant I can go to and have it be consistently amazing, no matter what I get. Their specials are always awesome, their coffee is great, the atmosphere is relaxing, literally everything about this place is on point. If you are out of town visiting, this should definitely be a go to on your list. If you live in Gilbert and haven't tried it, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best \"vibes\" in Gilbert. The decor is awesome. The history is amazing. And their method of operation is brilliant.

Upon walking into LM I could tell I was going to dig this place. Exposed brick. Huge pizza oven. Activity. Welcoming host. Lots of chatter. All good things.

My first time there I was a little thrown off by their system. You don't wait to be seated, you wait in a line to order your food. While in said line they have someone get the number of people in your party, give you a number and then tell you where you're sitting. Once you order your food and pay, you sit at your table and wait for the food to come out. 

I dig eating breakfast here because of their self-service coffee bar. There is no waiting for a server to come refill your mug. Simply get out of your seat, carry your cup over, and then choose from one of 4 different types of joe.

The food I've had here is nothing to die for, but it's well done and presented nicely. The cinnamon bun and Monkey bread/Sticky bun could feed a football team, so if you're up to split one while sipping on some coffee on a Saturday morning with your significant other, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I was very disappointed in my food. It sounded good and it looked good but it tasted weird. I don't think I'll ever eat here again. 

Also; don't order the chopped salad unless spicy sugar salad is your thing, in that case go nuts."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, large portions, nice atmosphere. We went to LM on Mother's Day. It only took us approximately 20 minutes to get through the line, which was surprisingly quick given the holiday and long line. The food came out quickly. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. We had a cinnamon roll as an appetizer, which was phenomenal. I highly recommend starting your meal on such a delicious note!"}
{"text":"We visit Liberty Market a few times throughout the year for dinner and we're always impressed. The food is always amazing and the desserts are fantastic. I like the selection and ambiance. It's cozy enough for a small party, but I don't feel bad bringing a larger group either. The patio is nice when the weather isn't too hot also. Don't forget to get a Salt River Bar."}
{"text":"Great place! I don't typically like places where I have to order at the counter, but this place was so good and so cute that I would make an exception for it. We've been a couple times for brunch now, and I've always been pleasantly surprised. The breakfast burritos are huge, but the best part is the red sauce, so delicious! You're also able to order mimosas by the picture, which is a huge plus! The inside of the restaurant is super cute, laid-back, and very comfortable. If you go on the weekends, make sure you get there super early."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is always delicious. I had the tower burger today and it did not disappoint. Their lunch and breakfast is always delicious! Would always definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So....if you're gonna charge me $12 for a sandwich and a bowl of potato salad it had better be good. Yes, the portions are very large; it's too bad I didn't even want to eat a third of my sandwich. Have you guys heard of this great thing called salt and pepper? It does wonders for grilled chicken; you should try it. The potato salad was meh. I tried a piece of pizza and it wasn't bad, but it was REALLY greasy and limp. Sorry, but compared to places like Zupas (or even Kneaders); Liberty Market is simply average. I will likely not be returning."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal or an experience here that I thought was just ok and for that reason I give them 5 stars. Friendly and efficient staff,  fresh ingredients, cool vibe, family or date friendly,  and creative ingredient combinations.  There's something for everyone from the vegetarian to the carnivore. My favorite side dish is the vinegarette based sweet potato salad.  Speaking of sweet, I dare you to walk by the dessert case without at least drooling on your chin.  Get there early as there's always a line. If they are busy,  enter on the Postino's side of the building back by the patio.

Update new visit: I'm not a huge fan of veggie burgers. ..I'll eat them but only if I'm dieting and sacrificing flavor for low calorie.....that is until I met the red bean and rice burger here. It's freaking delicious!

Noteably yummy....
Sticky bun
Steak sandwich 
Biscuits and gravy topped with fried dippy eggs
Red bean and rice burger 
Pancakes 
Caprese pasta salad
Sweet potato salad
Burgers
Fries
Steaks"}
{"text":"So good. Have never had a bad item on the menu. Lots of vegetarian options. Can get extremely busy! Like extremely busy."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, I went back here last night to try their lattes as I haven't tried them yet and my friend and I are on a coffee tour of Phoenix. They were delicious! The coffee was not too acidic and the barista even made a design in the foam.... I felt like I was back in Seattle. My friends also got some dinner, but I was going out later so I passed (begrudgingly). I tried a bite of theirs, though. The roasted chicken pasta was delicious, the chicken was so flavorful and the sauce was creamy, yet light. My other friend got mashed potatoes and hummus (weird dinner). The potatoes were really good, but the hummus wasn't anything special. We also shared a bread pudding. Wow.... this was super yummy.... it has a mountain of cinnamon -y whipped cream on top..... *drool*

So Liberty market continues to be one of my fave restaurants in the valley.... everything is just so good!"}
{"text":"First visit and it was hard to decide what to order - so many good options! The interior has a cool retro feel and staff is very friendly and helpful. I had the Cobb salad which had a good flavor. It could have used more egg, bacon,m, etc but was good. Hubs had Mac and cheese and thought it could be a little more flavorful. The pizza oven is impressive looking -next trip we may have to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was great, and the vibe of the restaurant was really cool. I've never been somewhere that has you order at the counter and bring food over to your table that is such high quality. We really enjoyed ourselves. 

The mac and cheese was heavenly; I only wish it were a bigger serving size!"}
{"text":"I really like Liberty Market. They are very well organized for how busy they can get. When you are waiting in line to order your food someone is going down the line making sure you have a table waiting for you when you are done ordering. The food that I have gotten this last visit and the visit before that has been fantastic. 

While you wait for to order you get to see people making the food as well as look into the display cases of the side dishes and the deserts which can be a bad thing when you are hungry. You end up getting more food then you thought you were going to get.

I got the Best Chicken sandwich and it was truly some great chicken so it could be the BEST chicken. The kettle chips are good and the Cheesecake that I ordered was amazing. 

I wish I lived closer I would visit more often."}
{"text":"I love, love, love everything about Liberty Market! 

Everything from the staff to the food and their selection of wine and beer. I'm a frequent diner at Liberty Market, and while you can usually find me there for their amazing breakfasts during the week, I'm also a huge fan of dinner as well, especially since they mix up the menu on the weekends and usually have something different every week.

If you have a chance, get your butt out here! It's amazing! (P.S. My faves: Cortado and the demi-breakfast with a blueberry pancake and bacon! Yummy!)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service! We were checked on, served delicious meals, and even had gluten free options. It's rare that a restaurant is truly understanding of gluten free needs and they even offer gluten free breads. Wonderful way to start a day!!!!"}
{"text":"I had chef David's breakfast sandwich. It was amazing! Breakfast here was super delicious. I would recommend this place for  breakfast over any other place."}
{"text":"Delicious!

Great service!

Order the bread pudding - it's too die for!

I also like the salmon plate - mmmMMmmmmmmm.

Free wi-fi -- check your receipt for the password.

Love the feel, it's a casual, semi-hipster feel. The bathrooms are amazingly nice.

Large and spacious.

I would come back again. Great place to do work on your laptop and eat your yummy breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, the food just keeps getting better! Flawless service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Breakfast at Liberty was absolutely outstanding!

The Zombie Girl and I had an errand to run in downtown Gilbert this morning, so I suggested we try Liberty.  I'm a huge Joe's Farm Grill fan, and I've been to LM once before, long ago, but never for breakfast.  The joint was packed when we arrived and we almost headed to the joint next door, but grabbed a couple of open seats at the counter and were served immediately.  I had the basic breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit & potatoes.  Zombie Girl had some fancier scrambled affair.  Everything was heavenly.  Scrambled eggs rarely excite me, but these were just so.. perfect.  Fluffy, fresh, flavorful.  The bacon was great (and Brak loves bacon and is a huge bacon critic - this was definitely top-shelf stuff).  Pototaes were great.  And, the service was super-friendly, fast, informative, talkative, and really made us feel happy to be there.  LM is definitely getting into our regular weekend breakfast rotation.  Joe, you've done it again - you really know how to run a restaurant.  Please open something in downtown Chandler - it could really use your talents."}
{"text":"Our first visit. Good food, good staff, massive portions. Be prepared for a long wait if it's crowded. Pluses - Fresh OJ by the carafe & tasty sticky buns the size of your head!
Would probably try again when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the food ordering process but still having a waiter/waitress but I loved the food, and the oatmeal cream pie cookie is amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places. I once caught the owner/chef shopping for fresh goods at the Farmers Market. The food is fresh, delicious, and the vibe is hip. 
I like to take people who have never been there here to experience Liberty Market! Shout out for the bread pudding - and well pretty much anything in the bakery and dessert windows! I love the Cobb salad and white pizza. But my favorite is the espresso  - that is where it is at. They have a GORGEOUS espresso machine. Prices are moderate but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"So i have been to this place once but loved it. They have a great atmosphere and unique setting. I had to stand in line for about 10-15 minutes to order my food but hey... no big deal! I ordered the Turkey and Cranberry sandwich with brie cheese (i forget what they named it at the restaurant). But the food was terrific and the service was great. One of my friends ordered the Mac and Cheese burger and loved it too. Its pretty quick to get your food once you have ordered.

Such a cute place with great food! Highly reccomended"}
{"text":"I've been to the Liberty Market twice now and had great experiences both times.  The first trip, my wife and I just went in for coffee - and unfortunately we had already eaten dinner and dessert.  I had a cappuccino which did not disappoint, and required no augmentation - and my wife got her usual decaf americano with splenda and milk.  The desserts we saw looked fantastic - and apparently we were there for one of Joe's friend's birthday and they had these fantastic looking cupcakes (how did I know?!)

Second trip was with my brother, mom, and step-dad for dinner.  I ordered the farmer sandwich (veggies + goat cheese) which was delicious, and a perfect size.  Not too large, not too small.  Bro ordered the sloppy joe extra spicy - it was good, but not knock your socks off.  Mom and step-dad ordered pizza (1/2 cheese, 1/2 pep), I tried a small piece, it had a great sauce, fresh cheese, and a crisp + chewy crust.  They also split a mixed greens salad which looked fantastic.

We ordered dessert which was a granola bar (awesome), brownie (great reports, but alas, no walnuts for this nut), and I got a slice of pumpkin-apple bread to go (eventually tried this at home and was yummy).

The decor is really nifty - there is an open kitchen that runs almost the entire indoor portion of the restaurant.  There is a wood-fired pizza oven and it looks like a prep-kitchen in the back.  The drinking glasses are actually glass, and all of the tables are nice dark wood with very comfortable chairs.

I over-heard Joe talking to another table about not advertising just yet to make sure that all of the kinks are worked out.  He also mentioned later when I was ordering coffee that the cupcakes were a special event dessert and might not be a regular item.

The entire staff is incredibley friendly and made the experience that much better.  It's too bad that Gail W. had such a bad experience - and also too bad that there is no real detail in the review.

Give it a try - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Here now for the first time....was headed to Joe's Real BBQ but decided to try a new place. I had the Cuban which was very good and filling! My cold case side was the potato salad also very good with all the potatoes being cooked completely if you know what I mean. 
My other half had the ' best chicken' sandwich which was well received. One comment on the avocado aioli was that it was spicy. The surprise hit was the sweet potato salad, a refreshing change of pace. A bit spendy but worth an occasional visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the chiliquiles.  I asked for eggs to be over easy, they came out over hard.  Because there is virtually no service there and nobody checks up on you, I just sat there and some what reluctantly ate my over hard eggs.  I also found it amusing that there is a tip line on the bill before a service or a lack there of, is provided...  All that said the flavor of the food was nice, the temperature of the food was decent and the restaurant ambience was cool."}
{"text":"So yummy! Cinnamon rolls are awesome. Share one with a friend and a cup of coffee. For lunch score a white pizza with chicken, bacon, arugula, and pine nuts. Really any pizza here will do!"}
{"text":"I kind of feel like a jerk for taking YEARS to get to Liberty. I've been following Joe on Twitter for about 5 years. We have a lot of mutual friends, and I bumped into him at a wedding. I knew it was him because of the hat. 
I live in CenPho, so Gilbert is like a day trip to the country for me. But, my boyfriend lives there, so I am finally going to places I've been hearing about forever. I love Liberty Market! 
I had a burger with horseradish that was that day's special. My boyfriend had the Cuban. We both loved our food! The potato chips were homemade, which is pretty much the coolest thing ever. 
The staff looks happy to work here. The place was PACKED, but the tables emptied and got filled right away. They seem to have a good system down for times that are busy like these.
I even saw two people I know there, so that tells you what kind of place you're at.
I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear, the food is still 5 stars.

The service on the otherhand....yikes.  I moved to Seattle three years ago, and this is the first time I've returned to AZ. Liberty was a must visit. We went for a 2pm lunch on a Sunday,  and it was nuts.  Our reserved table wasn't wiped down, it was 25 minutes before our meal came out, despite others in line after us receiving their food.  The final insult was when the additional side of aioli I asked for was never brought.  I loved Liberty when I used to live in AZ, and it's a shame that things have progressed in this fashion."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy coming here for breakfast.  Seriously some of the best biscuits and gravy!  Delicious pancakes and their french toast is like a bread pudding (kind of).  Really delicious food and you can appreciate the quality of the ingredients they use.  Coffee is excellent too.  Plus on your birthday you get a free breakfast!

We had dinner here once years ago.  It was too \"fancy\" for the kids.  They had a hard time finding choices.  I don't know if that has changed over the years but I do remember enjoying what we ordered that visit."}
{"text":"Always reliable for fresh, delicious food.  Service has always been very good. You might have to wait in line a little on weekends. 
*Best Sangria in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my birthday and have breakfast and it was delicious! The food came out really quick, was full of flavor and filling. The coffee is also very good here!"}
{"text":"Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious. I'm serious. It's that good. 

And I'm talking everything here. The food (priority number one for me), the atmosphere, the service... EXCELLENT.

This was  my second time back and I was even more blown away... I got shivers, I closed my eyes, I made \"mmmm\" sounds. I think I embarrass Kyle when we go out to eat... whatever I like my food beezies!

I ordered the Caprese sandwich again... the bread was a little crispy and made my mouth hurt but it still tasted like it was made by the gods. Instead of the caprese pasta salad (which is BOMB) I got the sweet potato pasta salad which was extremely good! I was SO FULL. 

Kyle got the Picnic sandwich, which had him talking about flavor combos and \"mmm-ing\" to himself... so I'm not the only one here people. 

So even though we were full I'm a dessert person I made Kyle share the bread pudding with me.... WORTH IT. It's smothered in the best whipped cream I've ever tasted and it's so eggy and delectable I died a little.

We also had coffee! The barista was awesome, so friendly and he recommended Kyle try the cortadito which was sweet but so perfectly blended with the espresso that I almost drank his whole drink instead of mine. I got a soy latte which was just ok bc the soy milk flavor was too strong. 

everyone was so helpful and friendly here. The busser even stopped to tell me the bread pudding is made with their cinnamon roll bread! Ahhhh-mazing!

SO GO HERE"}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to treating me and my 13-year-old daughter to a night out for just the two of us. Just didn't find the food that good. She had the Mac and cheese entree - I can't imagine the kids portion being much smaller as her portion was quite tiny.

I had the Tower Burger. It was between that and the French dip. Maybe I chose wrong. I ordered a side of fingerling potatoes and was given about 5 and they were the size of my pinkie.

Maybe there was some stellar menu item I need to try and my choices just weren't the best. Though the food was disappointing, service and ambience were spot on."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is one of my new favorite places in the Gilbert area! We had the Grilled Chicken Pasta and Molinari Pizza, and I was wowed by both. To read my full food experience, visit my food blog at

{"text":"Liberty Market where have you been all my life?!? Not sure why I am just discovering this place but we will be going regularly from now on.

We went around 8AM on a Sunday and there were only a few people in line in front of us. The restaurant was pretty busy but we secured a table for two with the help of the hostess easily and quickly.

I had the best biscuits and gravy of my life (added two eggs on top for $3) and my dining partner had a huge breakfast burrito (he couldn't finish it, it was so big). He chose the chorizo for his meat, it was pretty spicy so be warned. Both meals were delicious. The $3 a la carte pancake we ordered was just okay, but I am assuming when you get the full size pancake meal it is bigger and better.

It got really busy the later it got, so earlier is better if you don't want to wait too long. It also seems as if you can make reservations for larger parties, and sit at the coffee bar if there's just one or two of you (not sure how to secure a seat there and if you can order from the barista or still have to wait in the ordering line).

AND their baked goods looked amazing. I am sure they switch it up all the time but when we were there they had a homemade version of those Little Debbie stuffed oatmeal cookie things, I was drooling just looking at them.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This one is a cut above the rest.  For one of the most important meals of the day....PICK LIBERTY!  The Biscuits and Gravy is delicious, you are not going to find a better combo in AZ!  
All of us were in a \"sharing\" mood mainly because we all thought we ordered something better than each other. It was like, have some of mine..NO have some of mine!  

I grabbed a vietnamese coffee, Ca Phe, it was iced so what is better than that in the summer.

Get some, or a lot, you will be glad you did yo!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered take out from this place several times and everything we got was amazing!!!! I especially recommend their breakfast (only until 11:30 on weekdays, sadly), and the chicken with apricot glaze! I don't know how they get the chicken so tender, it might be the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant, and I love it.  Spent a lot of time and money there.  They even allowed us to have our small rehearsal dinner for our wedding there and it was FANTASTIC.
Pros: everything.  Food is great--ALWAYS.  People are great--ALWAYS.  They are friendly, attentive and enjoy being alive.  My favorite dish, the salmon BLT... HIGHLY recommend it.  It's fabulous.  Breakfast is also GREAT here.
Only thing you could complain about is it gets really busy, but that's what happens to good restaurants.
This is a must-visit restaurant... might become your favorite too!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Located in downtown Gilbert so after a big yummy meal you can walk down the street for something sweet or to get a drink or two. Very cute and quaint place and love that you can order then sit down. Everything from their burgers to salads you can't go wrong. Great environment for a quick lunch, family dinner or brunch with friends!"}
{"text":"Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their \"Burger Daze\", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  

I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!"}
{"text":"The service is awesome and fast. Their salads are great but the Salt river bar is the best!"}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast! I had the western scramble this morning with an iced chai. This is probably the best breakfast I have eaten in a long time. My husband ordered pancakes with bacon but it paled in comparison to what I ordered. The potatoes were so tasty and the biscuit was so good I didn't want to stop eating. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Great choice for brunch. We went there on a Saturday morning and the place was pretty busy.  I liked how they set up their ordering process - the line snakes along a countertop, indoors and out of the sun, where you can lean on the counter and study the menus (brunch and lunch) while you wait.  While we were still in line, a server visited us and asked us our table preference.  By the time we got to the counter to order, our shaded outdoor table was waiting for us.  

You may very well need a few minutes to decide what to order.  If you're going late in the morning, your first decision might be lunch vs. brunch (served until 1pm).  After much agonizing, I selected the chilaquiles, which was on the lunch menu even though I always think of it as a brunchy dish.  I also added the optional chorizo (other proteins also available).  I wasn't disappointed - the spicy green chile and chorizo combination needed no additional hot sauce. It was layered between crunchy tortilla chips and two easy over eggs.  Fantastic!  I could barely finish it.  

While I had a hot house coffee, there's also a bar if you'd prefer a bloody Mary with your brunch.  Outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"Yet another great local restaurant brought into being by Joe Johnston (creator of Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Real BBQ).  The place is built out of a revamped 1930's grocery store and is super cool inside!  They have a wood fire pizza oven (you'll see all this wood stacked outside on the patio -- adds to the cool ambience) and swanky espresso bar.  The bathrooms are pretty awesome too.

Most all the food is amazing here.  The pizzas are really tasty, so much so that I never seem to have the self control to not order them and try something new.  If you're vegetarian or trying to eat more greens, try the veggie pizza -- made with local produce, whatever is freshly picked ends up as toppings!  Salads and sandwiches are also delicious.  And the dessert selection is always pretty great.  

The only negatives are that the place can get incredibly busy at peak hours, so come early or be prepared to wait.  Also, food (entree, drink, dessert, etc.) adds up quick and can get kinda pricey here.  Another bummer is that the waitstaff won't seat you if your whole party isn't present, which has been an issue/hassle in the past when a large table was needed for a birthday party or special event but all the guests had yet to arrive.  Other than that though, it's wonderful!

Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal!"}
{"text":"Got the smothered burrito with chorizo, and the Sicilian scramble today.  Of course we got cortados and cortaditos again.  The carafe of OJ was tasty!

The burrito is a LOT to eat and I recommend splitting it.  The sauces really make this dish but the chorizo with potatoes inside is ridiculous.  This is second only to the chilaquiles for breakfast here.  

The Sicilian scramble was light and tasty, but my party raved over it.  I likes it but there are so many other good dishes here with boldness."}
{"text":"I like Liberty Market, quite a bit.  The only thing I've ever had that I didn't quite like over the past few years was the bread pudding, I found it too mushy.  I've mostly been there for breakfast which is always delicious!  My mom absolutely loves their coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing from the service to the drinks and food just all around a great place"}
{"text":"\"I'm a carb queen. I'll always order macaroni and cheese, but I don't want it to be fancy. I want it to be as close to Kraft Services as it can possibly get!\" ? Drew Barrymore

Oh, Drew.  You're so relatable.  Anyways, we stopped in on a late Thursday night after spin class across the street.  We originally were gonna pop in to the bruschetta and wine place next door but we wanted to give Liberty Market a try.

We had ordered the Rustic Mac N Cheese ($10.50) and the Thursday Pasta Special of Crab Chile Rellenos ($18).  Carbs are love, amirite?  The mac & cheese is crazy good.  It's so cheesy and buttery.  Upon first bite, you know you're eating a super decadent take on mac & cheese.  I loved the breadcrumbs on top as well.  The whole dish came hot and steamy like an x-rated movie.  As for the Crab Rellenos, whoa!  Crab flavor kicks you in the mouthpants!  The risotto wasn't quite creamy enough but still had great flavor.  The citrus helps cut through the rich Chile Rellenos sauce.

Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed the food but it was a bit underwhelming for the price.  The portions were also a bit on the \"children's portion\" size which made post-workout me sad.  Order at the register and then find a seat."}
{"text":"Merging my accounts; I published this back on... 6/10/2010

Great place to hang out with friends or family. The good is great, the atmosphere is relaxing. The best thing on the menu I think is their Tower Burger. I almost always get it. It literally is a tower! Their pizza is good too and is good even when it's not conventional pizza. 

Their coffee bar is great too. They have some excellent brews too.

I highly recommend L.M.!"}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy. Doesn't make sense to stand in line while tables are open. Pretzel appetizer was burnt."}
{"text":"I also don't understand the hype, and the seating arrangement is ridiculous.  We waited in line for over 1/2 hour JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER because they couldn't figure out how to seat the part of six ahead of us.  We were only a party of three for heavens sake, why make us wait?  Terribly managed, just ok food.  I would have had better food faster at the food trucks.  Won't return."}
{"text":"So, my pal and I stopped in here the other day to take a look-see around. The decor was inviting and it was all a buzz with customers. Seemed interesting enough. After moseying over to the mini market area to see several random things, including an all-in-one survival tool and a spoon with bendable arms and legs (this I bought!), I decided I needed some coffee. Stat. 

I put in my order for some Cuban espresso. Then I oogled and drooled over their pastry section. I was tempted to pick up a slice of carrot cake for my dad. It's his favorite. 

Time ticked by. And then, after 10 minutes, I was asked what I was waiting for. Coffee. Simple enough, right? Apparently I should have gone to the OTHER bar to order. The one with the espresso machines. But it was mad busy at the time, so I did what any college-educated java-drinker would do: I went to the first available associate. And she took my order. And my money. But she failed to let the other girl behind the OTHER bar know that I needed some caffeine. 

Not to fear, my order was taken care of, apologies were said more than once and I got a free cookie out of it. By the way, that truffle chocolate cookie was AMAZING. So was the Cuban espresso. 

Definitely worth checking out. Hopefully they get that ordering glitch fixed soon."}
{"text":"Liberty Market is one of my all-time favorite places to eat. Great food, great vibe, great service. We go there for family dinners, birthday celebrations, date nights, girls' night out, or working lunches.

Favorites: picnic sandwich, caprese side dish, chicken pasta, crab cakes, red velvet cake, chocolate chip banana bread, cortadito.

I love the way the owners interact with their customers on Twitter.

Only negative experience I've had is I once had the caprese sandwich and it blew my socks off, but then the 2nd time it was dry and cold. Hoping it was just an off day. 

I (and all my friends) highly recommend Liberty Market!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place!  This is the type of place that you would find in Scottsdale...so what a find to have it in Gilbert and close.  Great food, if you have hearing problems in a restaurant this probably isn't the place for you...if not...go for a visit!"}
{"text":"After Rave reviews from my best friend I decided to venture over to Liberty market for a birthday brunch.

1st of all - this area of Gilbert is absolutely adorable.

At 10:00 A.M. on a weekday it certainly wasn't packed by any means but there was a good amount of people there. You pick up a menu as you walk in and then place your order up at the counter and a server will bring your food out to you as it's ready.

She got the Western Scrambler which was a good amount of food but she said she had better items on the menu. I was deciding between the Breakfast Quesadilla and the Biscuits and Gravy. The girl taking my order recommended the quesadilla as it was much more filling (and I'm all about getting filled up!). The quesadilla did take up my entire plate and was actually very tasty. I personally don't like the quesadillas to be crunchy so I wasn't a huge fan of that, but otherwise it was pretty solid!

I feel like the food is a little bit higher priced then what I would want to pay for it but I can ALMOST justify paying it. Maybe next time I'll have to try the biscuits and gravy since they seem to be loved by other yelpers!"}
{"text":"Long time friends of what used to be the best secret in Gilbert. No longer the corner market but some of the freshest and most delicious food in the East Valley. Just point and shoot at the menu as they are all terrific or try one of their daily, weekly, or monthly specials. If your a coffee drinker, you're in luck as they have a great coffee bar. The press is the way to go. After breakfast, lunch, or dinner, try a little something sweet. You'll be glad you did. My personal favorite is the ice cream sandwich but I've enjoyed a variety of savory sweets."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of restaurants that match the quality and taste of Liberty Market. I've been there at least a dozen times, and it's the perfect place to meet up with someone for a long chat. I'm a typical guy when it comes to food choices, but I LOVE their Picnic Salad. It's one of the few salads I go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Great ambience. Need I say more. I've been there for breakfast, and I have a really hard time diverting from the Denver Scramble.  You also can't beat their egg salad sandwich for lunch. It's part of the Joe's BBQ/Joe's Farm Grill restaurants, and this one backs up those others with just as awesome of an experience."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- it's close to where I work and good for out of town visitors.
- friendly, consistent service.
- fresh options

Cons:
- only 1 soup option, minestrone most the year. Minestrone is not bad, but I return to places with soup options especially for lunch.
- Only once was my table clean when I sat down, all other times I have either flagged someone down to wipe it down or cleaned it myself.

The food is generally good and every out of town work visitor has enjoyed it the first time, so maybe I'm just tired of the menu options. I would still recommend at least giving it a whirl for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Impossible to imagine that a great restaurant and joint exists in the middle of dusty-hot-flat Gilbert! This is an incredible destination, whether you are craving for a salad, pizza or homemade desserts. 5 stars for great food, service, staff, decor and value!"}
{"text":"I am a food connoisseur and I must say that this place is dynamite! Firstly, the staff is very friendly and each member provides a high degree of hospitality. The manager does a great job to make sure that everyone is being productive in addition to enjoying his or her job. The pizza oven facilitator always talks to me when I go to Liberty even when he is busy with pizza orders. The bottom line is, the staff wants to make sure that the customer has a wonderful experience so that they will come back. Now to discuss the food, I ordered their \"Burger of the Week\" Deal and it was like heaven on a bun. It came with three rich-juicy patties, pastrami, swiss cheese, and a pretzel bun. The burger was perfectly cooked, tender and fresh, and hot, right off of the grill. It was the best burger that I ever had. Not to mention, if you need something sweet and not just savory, the ice cream cookie is unbelievable. It may be the best thing that I have ever put in my mouth. All in all, Liberty Market is the total and complete restaurant experience. There is a nice, friendly, and efficient staff; phenomenal food; and it has a great location being right in Downtown Gilbert. I guarantee you that when you go there the first time, you will definitely come back a second time hands down!"}
{"text":"I went to Liberty Market for the first time last Friday to hang out with friends at the latest #evfn. I have to say I was very impressed with the place and the staff. They took excellent care of a very large crowd. Since I wasn't really hungry, I just glanced at their pastries, but what a gorgeous sight. I picked a blueberry scone which was large, not terribly expensive, and a soda. The scone was wonderful and I savored it the whole evening. I would definitely go back if #evfn touches down there again, but more importantly, I would trek back down into Gilbert again to try something else to enjoy."}
{"text":"3 stars all for a great atmosphere and good customer service. Minus 2 stars because I wouldn't come back for the food. To be fair we only came for desserts, and therefore we only tried a couple of side items and a couple of desserts. Everything we tried was ok, but nothing more than that. Simply put, when I pay more than $5 for a slice of cake I expect it to be a generous portion that I want to finish and that was not the case here. Again, service was great."}
{"text":"Just a little update -- we were greeted at the door by a very friendly \"host\" and he mentioned that we \"should find a table before we order as it gets busy\" which totally discredit the way they used to do things. HUGE IMPROVEMENT! Thanks!

ANOTHER UPDATE: As of the 25th, apparently when it starts getting cramped, a nice employee will come by and \"reserve\" a table for you. I guess this is supposed to ease the anxiety of \"where to sit, where to sit\"...It's a nice addition. But, I still think a place like this deserves servers."}
{"text":"After a day of hiking in the Superstition Mountains, we were exhausted and famished. We drove over to Gilbert's Heritage District for a well-deserved dinner. Most of the places were packed. We also had our faithful dog-porter with us which further limited our dining options. After checking online, we confirmed that Liberty Market has a pet-friendly outdoor seating area. Fortunately, they weren't too busy for a Friday night. They have a seating policy wherein you have to first order at the walk-up counter before you get a table. While queueing, the hostess hands you a number and she places the same number on your assigned table. This seating policy is enforced only on weekends, holidays and busy times. 

The open kitchen gives you a front-row view into the various culinary activities of Liberty Market. They also have displays of their desserts and pastries which entice you while you wait in line to give your order. 

My partner-in-dine and I shared the pretzel twist appetizer. It came with white cheddar cheese sauce and whole-grain mustard. It sated our hunger pangs temporarily while we waited with barely suppressed anticipation for our main dishes. My partner-in-dine got the Hot Cuban sandwich with a side of roasted sweet potato salad while I selected the Grilled Chicken Pasta in parmesan cream sauce. My partner-in-dine's verdict on the hot sandwich was lukewarm. It failed to impress him. On the other hand, I was blown away by my magnificent pasta dish. The cream sauce was the apex of creaminess. Every bite of the pasta was a glimpse into pasta utopia. The partner-in-dine couldn't help himself and reached over to swipe some of my pasta and grilled chicken. 

We also got a slice of Chocolate Death Ray cake to go. I'm happy to report that it was a perfect late-night snack. It replaced all the calories burned hiking earlier in the day.

The food at Liberty Market was exemplary and tasted of quality ingredients. The service was courteous and attentive. The food came out promptly and the wait staff came by several times to check on us. They even brought out a water bowl for Winston, the dog-porter."}
{"text":"New to Arizona & I was told by a couple of people to try this restaurant & boy am I glad I did!!! We went there for brunch & I had the \"simple breakfast sandwhich\" Which consisted of scrambled eggs, cheese & bacon on a ciabatta roll... It was DELICIOUS!!!! I also had the breakfast potatoes which were also very good. 

My wife had a meatball press & she loved it! 

The mimosas were superb & you have to try the caramel sea salt bar(I think that's the name of it) It had saltines at the bottom of the bar & it was wonderful!!! 

The staff were very nice! Can't wait to come back & try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I don't know what I could say about Liberty Market that hasn't been said multiple times already.  But here goes. 

The people- helpful, friendly, accommodating.  Always happy to answer a question or to whip up a sample of some tempting little treat.

The menu- exhaustive. I've yet to try something I didn't love. If you can't find something to eat here, then you must work for the competition!  My go-to meal is the Liberty Bowl with pasta. 

The atmosphere- kitschy, eclectic. The neon, the colors, the espresso machine (more on that in a bit). Plenty of indoor seating. Nice outdoor patio. Bathrooms that are works of art. 

Parking- can be a little rough, what with all of the other businesses there in downtown Gilbert. 

The Espresso Bar- Oh. My. Goodness. That E61 espresso machine is older than me- and probably most Yelpers (if not any two combined), but wow does it make a delicious shot of espresso!  If you've never had a Cortadito, I highly recommend giving it a try.

Go to Liberty Market. Do it. Do it now. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed when the owner takes the time to stop at tables and mingle with the patrons. The staff as a whole was really pleasant, friendly, and helpful to this first timer! I ordered the Mac and cheese and added bacon. It was to die for! My only complaint is that there wasn't more...I seriously almost ordered a second helping because I didn't want to stop eating it! Can't wait to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with a nice variety of things to choose from. Bakery items are to die for."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with a good number of vegetarian options.  It gets crowded for breakfast but is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The decor is cute and the wait staff was friendly but our lunch today was... Meh. We had the white pizza, Cuban sandwich and a Cobb salad and while everything tasted fine, there was nothing special about any of our food. Also, there were a lot of flies everywhere. I would come back to try breakfast, but try one of the other excellent restaurants in downtown Gilbert for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The wait in line situation is a little unconventional but it actually works pretty well."}
{"text":"We love Liberty! Cool atmosphere, great food , exceptional coffees. We frequent regularly and it's always consistent."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive staff -- all in a gracefully redesigned historic space.

I had the crispy thin crust pizza with plenty of basil, from their wood fired  oven and some Lorina soda. Open breakfast, lunch and dinner with plenty of favorites to try later, no doubt I will be back soon.

The drink menu included some local brews, but the day was young so instead, I wrapped things up at the E61 bar with their signature \"cortadito\", a Cuban espresso served with raw sugar in twin shot glasses, a delight for any coffee lover."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for lunch. I must admit, for a newbie, it is a bit confusing on how to order and where they seat you. Knowing that you order first and while ordering a guy takes your number and puts it on a table that then becomes yours, would be a bit helpful.  

We had the Italia Panini and a pasta caprese salad.  Very nice and the Panini's bread was very tasty and crisp. The place was busy with both families with kids, and young people. It was a bit noisy, but the food and wine made up for it.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was great!  This was our first time here on our yearly trips.  It won't be our last.   We were there for breakfast and for some reason the line moved extremely slow.  We were there at 9am.  However after we ordered the food came out in a timely fashion.  Loved the blueberry scones."}
{"text":"Breakfast before golf on a 100 degree day.  Started with the honeybun it was well spectacular.  Big enough to feed a small army.   I did order the insulin shooter with it thankfully.  Now one of my favorite foods are nachos. ..I ordered the chica...ok I have no idea how to spell it.  Basically it was breakfast nachos with chorizo and two over easy eggs. ..HEAVEN.   Will be back."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to grab lunch and coffee.  I haven't tried breakfast or dinner here (yet), although their weekend dinner specials always sound interesting.

My favorites are the caprese sandwich, potato salad, caprese salad, and egg salad sandwich (with or without bacon).  All really flavorful and delicious.  I've also tried a pasta bowl and pizza when I was with my daughter, since there is no kids' menu, and they were also good.

Desserts - huge portions and yummy flavors, but... nothing has blown me away yet. I'll have to keep trying! :)

I am a coffee junkie, and I think this place serves the best tasting coffee I've ever had. The baristas are always willing to suggest something when I have a hard time deciding.

Lastly, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"In reality somewhere between a 2 and a 3.

Well, I'm clearly missing something here.  This is the second \"Joe's\" restaurant I've been to now and I remain less than impressed.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't OMFG great either.

So we had a caprese sandwich and what they called a liberty sandwich.

Ok so for the caprese sandwich.  Cheese, good.  Tomato, good.  Basil, good.   Bread, not good.  For whatever reason they toasted the bread to the point of it being a crouton.  Really??  It was supposed to be a panini type sandwich, but it comes out like a crouton??  For all the hype behind this place you'd think they could toast a piece of bread.  I mean I can and I don't even run a restaurant.

Ok, on to the liberty sandwich, which is actually a turkey sandwich with green apples, candied walnuts, bleu cheese and red pepper aioli.  Good news, they didn't toast the bread so it actually came out pretty good.  Turkey was good.  As for the combination of all the ingredients...not so much.  I get someone sat down and put this all together and somewhere along the line thought it was a good idea but in reality, too many competing textures, too many competing flavors.

Both sandwiches came with potato salad...not bad...but I didn't come here to eat potato salad.

Now having said the above, the place was as busy as a Greyhound bus terminal (lunch time).  So is this place as good as everyone says it is?  Or is it me?  Here's what I'm thinking, it's just ok.  People give it way more credit because it's in the old part of Gilbert and as such makes it extra \"cool.\"  Well, just like you can't eat ambiance, you can't eat cool."}
{"text":"A friend of a friend recommended this place to us. Let me just say, best sandwich I had in a long time. And pretty decent pricing, for a seafood sandwich. I had the crab po'boy sandwich, very flavorful, and great plating. Service was great!! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Liberty market is perfect for a lunch or dinner. Unfortunately I haven't come for breakfast yet so I don't know how good their breakfast is. The deserts look really good also. They have the pizza and salad lunch combo plus they full sandwich menu. The Cuban is awesome with the sweet potato side. Today I got the caprese sandwich with the potatoes salad. Liberty market is always a good choice."}
{"text":"Originally a Grocery Market years ago and transformed into a modern restaurant. 

Arrived on a Saturday around 1130 am and then you walk in and the stand in the line to order your food. The line was probably 30 people deep.

They have a good selection of pizza, burgers, salads and breakfast items.

I ordered the green chili scramble and it was pretty tasty and just the right flavor without burning up your mouth.

The area around is pretty amazing with a strong compliment of restaurants around on Gilbert Road.

Service was excellent and food was very good, it is a long ways from where I live, approximately 35 miles but may come back to try other items"}
{"text":"Just had the best macaroons ever! And the coffee is to die for. I love the Maiden Lane and the burgers are  so juicy! Great place for lunch with the girls or a fun date night!"}
{"text":"Went back to Liberty Market the other day and bought the Molinari pizza. A friend had complained that the outer edge always burned while the middle stayed too soft and undercooked. I like the stuff that comes on these pies, so I figured I would give it a shot.

She was right. It wasn't unedible, but the middle part was pretty scary. I have no idea how they should fix this problem but this pie wasn't great even though I still love this place.

Oh yeah, Joe, you also need Sweet & Lo!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and just not a fan. You'd think with the long lines that there would be something special here, but it's really just kind of a hipstery, expensive breakfast place. You'll pay 6-pack prices for a can of beer. The staff is friendly. Meh. It's okay."}
{"text":"We came here for small bites after going to the food truck festival 5 minutes from here. I don't want to judge this place too harshly since they only items i ordered was the Macoron....It was way to sweet and i didn't like the fact that it was covered with sugar. It lacks the taste of how it should really taste like and I certainly did not enjoy it. My friends ordered a pizza and they seem to like it. The service is definitely great and staffs are super friendly.

I'll come back here to try other items but definitely will not order desserts again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it there!  My friends and I went there for breakfast and, as a vegan, I must say that I'm wary of restaurants for breakfast as most usually don't have good options, BUT Liberty Market had wonderful vegan options for breakfast!  I loved it and will return when I'm back in the downtown Gilbert area."}
