{"text":"A few tasty dishes. Enjoyed the beef and tuna tataki, and some of the rolls. Would definitely recommend going during Hapa Hour from 5:30-6:30 when a selection of menu items is on for half price. Combine this with the Thursday drink special on martini-type drinks (1oz for $5 and 2oz for $7.50) and you have a great combo!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch with work, or for happy hour drinks. The staff is friendly and the ramen is GREAT - one of the more underrated ramen places in the city, without the crazy wait for a table. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is vague about their closing time.   Following a recommendation for late night eating in Avenue magazine, we showed up at 1045pm on a Friday night.   Rather than serving until midnight, as outlined in Avenue, they refused to even seat us.  I would CALL and check to see if they are open later evenings."}
{"text":"Been there many times. Especially like the happy hour, really bring some special foods and drinks into it. Highly recommend try some happy hour foods and you won't be disappointed. For example like the beef tataki for only $5 or $6. Their ramen is also fantastic, I like the black garlic and the spicy ramen. Definitely one of the ramen restaurant in Calgary I will choose to come again"}
{"text":"The second time I went to Happa and I was impressed with the food. They have an interesting twist on Japanese/Korean but still have the classics. I would recommend trying the renkon gyoza, the spicy pork stone bowl and the temari! I went to Happa for the first time last year but wasn't impressed with the food. We decided to give it another try since it's very conveniently located. They have some great happy hour items from 530-630 every day! And daily drink specials too!   The service was quite good. Our server was not very knowledgable about the menu as I suppose she was new so we were patient. Another gentleman came by and made sure we were enjoying everything and made recommendations which was very helpful!   I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Hapa Izakaya to try their Big Taste 2017 dinner menu. Our experience was very underwhelming, which started off by walking into the freezing restaurant where either they do not have heating, or were just oblivious to the fact that most guests were clearly cold and wearing jackets and winter coats while having dinner.    We ordered a Wagyu nigiri carpaccio to start, which consisted of two pieces of nigiri with what was supposed to be carpaccio meat on top. Contrary to what you would get with a good carpaccio, the meat slices were thick and chewy. For what is supposed to be haute cuisine, this is inexcusable.  As our main, we ordered a sockeye salmon foil yaki, which left a lot to be desired. The salmon filet was decently cooked on the sides but raw and rubbery in its centre, and served over a mushroom and barley \"risotto\" that tasted almost like gravy. The dish not only had no relation to Japanese cuisine at all (isn't that the idea of going to a Japanese restaurant?), it was also poorly executed. Frankly, I think I could achieve better results at home.  We also tried a spicy veggie roll from their regular menu which was good, although soaked in spicy mayo.  The star of the night was the dessert, a matcha creme brulee that was exquisite. It is the only reason why I give two stars instead of one.  The above experience, of course, is charged by Hapa Izakaya at the price of fine dining. But the quality to justify the price is just not there. I don't expect to be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Robson St YVR location about 3-4 times and was blown away by the food. I was in disbelief that they were opening one here in YYC.  Tonight I treated myself after work, and found a seat at the bar. Same great whole staff welcome and goodbye, similar dark and trendy modern decor, and the same lively sound system as the Robson St. location. The service was attentive, friendly, warm, and the food ....on point and consistent to the Robson St. original. You have to try the Karaage- I dream about it often! Reso's are taken FYI. This is a great night time eatery with a modern but casual vibe. Although the menu is smaller than YVR locations, that will change, as will any supposed service inconsistencies(which were not apparent on my visit) -it's a newly opened restaurant, so cut them some slack folks and just enjoy the visual and flavor sensations this \"Incomparable\" Izakaya is known for. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. Received a traditional boisterous and friendly Izakaya greeting by staff upon entering.  Service was friendly and efficient throughout our meal. Kitchen is open so you can watch chefs in action depending on where you are seated. The space is dark towards the back but has high ceilings. There are high tables and some bench and booth seating. I would like to check it out at night.  We were there for the Big Taste. We started by sharing  the Carpaccio trio which was a trio of ahi tuna, sockeye salmon, and yellowtail with a yuzu citrus soy sauce. The fish was fresh and not soaked in the sauce.   We also shared the Appetizer trio of Goma-ae (parboiled mustard greens, with a tasty ground sesame sauce), cheese tofu (marscapone cheese \"tofu\" with honey, served on a cracker which was sweet and delicious), nasu agebitashi (deep fried eggplant with ginger soy marinade).  Then we shared the Buta no kakuni: simmered pork belly in a sweet soy broth which you make a \"taco\" in the house made steam buns and hot mustard - I recommend to soak your bun with the sticky sweet broth.  Lastly we split the Ocean in a bag: deep fried soft shell shrimp, soft shell crab, panko breaded oyster, shaken (table-side in a good old brown lunch bag) with 11 spices, served with grilled lemon that you can squirt all over the seafood.  For our mains, my friend ate all of their Chan Chan Salmon Ishiyaki (comes with raw Coho salmon that cooks in the piping hot stone bowl of rice with green onion and a miso mushroom sauce). I had the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was awesome. The yummy broth is pork and chicken based. The ramen noodles were tasty and had good amount of bite to them. The soup comes with BBQ pork belly, wakame seaweed, green onion, and half a soft boiled egg. Really loved the broth. Can't wait to tell others and go again."}
{"text":"This can become one of my favourite spots for Japanese food and drinks. It's trendy, lively and the food was awesome. Try the Hapa hot wings and the Spicy pork Ishi-yaki, it won't disappoint. @albertlam282"}
{"text":"We celebrated a friends birthday at Happa on Saturday night, and with a party of 10 you never know what to expect (forced set menus, frustrated servers etc.) We were pleasantly surprised to be seated at a cozy table for 10, and the servers were attentive and friendly! Our water and teas were always filled to the brim- and for my friends who were drinking- the server recommended some great shots for the table. The food was fantastic, the Waygu steak bites are to die for, as are the Ebi Chili Shrimp. The price point was actually quite impressive. For $50 a person we got a huge variety of Japanese tapas + cocktails and shots for 7/10 people (3 pregnant women not drinking in the group). The server actually grabbed a few other wait staff to deliver a unique birthday desert and energetic version of \"Happy Birthday\" for our friend, they legitimately seemed happy to help us celebrate.  We had friends who had visited Happa earlier this year and commented that the restaurant has definitely improved, I guess their experience was much better this time around. We will most certainly be back to visit soon!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I can appreciate that this place is trying not to be traditional, however some of the dishes miss the mark. Also, my cocktail tasted like water."}
{"text":"Hapa is one of our favorite places in Vancouver, so when we found out there was one in Calgary, we were quite excited to check it out!  Unfortunately, the Calgary location falls short of the experience we've had in Vancouver.   What's good? Well the food is good. The croquettes are done very well, and so are the gyoza. I also enjoy thier rice bowls. The Sake selection is also quite good.  What could use improvement? We found the atmosphere not quite as inviting as the Vancouver locations (Robson & Yaletown). Also, the service could use some work. The manager was great, but the servers seem quite inexperienced. Finally, their dinnerware... Yeah funny thing to comment on, but we were expecting a small side plate and small bowl (as is common in thier other locations), but here you get a soup bowl and chopsticks. Wha?!?!?  What's missing? Where is the oyster bar and other seafood dishes?? We were looking forward to this as good seafood is in short supply in Calgary. Unfortunately there is not much seafood on the menu.   And no Calgary, sushi doesn't count, you don't go to an Izakaya for sushi. There is a lot of sushi on this menu, more than what I recall being on the Vancouver one.  Anyway, try it out if you have a chance. Go for the food, and don't expect much else."}
{"text":"This was an excellent recommendation by a friend, whose husband is a professional chef.  My large group of 15+ was accommodated with the most attentive service for the Set menu and individual orders.  They also have quite a few vegetarian options.  I highly recommend Hapa Izakaya for anyone who enjoys great service, a sweet ambiance, and excellent food! I will return!"}
{"text":"What started off with an above average dining experience unfortunately ended up being an annoying, insulting mess.  I had arranged a group dinner for my birthday, and three things went wrong during my experience at this restaurant:  1 - At the time of booking, I had told the man on the phone that we wanted to do the prix-fixe menu, and that I (the birthday girl) dont eat pork. I had asked if the pork course be substituted by something else? \"Sure, no problem\", he said. So I was a happy camper. When we were AT the restaurant, the waitress straight up told me the two pork courses will not be substituted. I didnt cause a fuss because it was my birthday, and just decided to pass the pork to my friends at the table.   2 - At the time of booking, I had told the man on the phone that we would like separate bills at the table. He said to just remind our server at the beginning of the meal. So when we were at the restaurant, I told our waitress we want separate bills, and she nodded and said \"Okay, no problem, noted!\" HOWEVER, during the course of our meal, our waitress's shift was over, so she left without passing this info on to the next waitress. At the end of our meal, sure enough our new waitress came with one bill. I told her that the first waitress noted down that we wanted separate bills, but this new waitress said she wasnt told of this, so basically 'too bad so sad'. One bill it is.  3 - This was the last straw. My group was only eight people. So after each of us figured out our bills with drinks, and paid, the new waitress comes to us saying we still owe $62. All eight of us were still there, and we had all fully paid for our portions. Even after we all showed our receipts to her, she kept pointing out bizarre math and trying to justify how we still owe money. It was ridiculous beyond comprehension. I was fuming by now. Separate bills like the first waitress had written down would not have resulted in this. We were literally there for 35 minutes, three of us taking turns to punch in the numbers FOR the waitress while she still protested that we owed money. The manager came over, and I told him that I was extremely displeased because we were now wasting our time and ruining our mood by standing around figuring out something which we have already paid for. He just nodded and said \"right right, I understand, but it's gotta be done\". So at the end it turned out we were only three dollars short. My friend took out a fiver and handed it to the waitress, so we could just leave. But by then the waitress was still confused and went to the back of the bar to do the math AGAIN with the manager and ANOTHER waitress, to verify if we were speaking the truth! Another 5 minutes later, she came back and asked for the three dollars. Needless to say, we handed her the same fiver we offered earlier, and left.   For a restaurant with such popular roots in Vancouver, this place was a PATHETIC display of customer service. There was NO apology from the manager, or anything at all. The whole crew there made us feel like we were either a) illiterate when it came to math, or b) thieves. Which is quite inaccurate since we were a group of mostly young professional engineers. And they wasted almost 45 minutes of our time because of their own incompetency and lack of communication between each other.   The only reason Hapa Izakaya Calgary gets two stars from me is because the food and drinks were tasty. But thats where it ends. The overall experience left a bad taste in my mouth, so I will NOT be returning. If you value your time, patience, and good customer service, I recommend you dont come here either, especially with a group."}
{"text":"Sigh. I've never been to the other locations in Van, so I can only write based on my experience here + the quality of their food and beverages.  Let's start with the food: Honestly, average westernized Japanese fare. On par with most of the other average sushi places in Calgary, but with the markup of the higher end places. I've had better Maki at Co-op, so I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here for that. I do appreciate that they had GF soy sauce, though.  The cocktails are where they shined. I ordered the Hello Kitty and had a sip of my friend's pear martini, and someone's Ginger Kitty (basically a Moscow mule). The Hello Kitty had strawberry purée and vodka, and while it (presentation-wise) looked like something you'd see at a bar that serves pre-made mixes at a 1000% markup; it was actually really fresh tasting and refreshing. It was pretty enough that other people ordered one after mine came to the table.  Now on to the service: My friend had called in advance to make the reservation and request the $35 tasting menu (prixe-fixe?). They refused to accommodate her request to swap out 2 of the pork items on the menu for her, but she didn't fuss about it, as there were plenty of other people at the table that don't have cultural restrictions. They did let me pick items off of the regular menu rather than the prixe-fixe, as I'm vegan and have a severe gluten intolerance.  The first waitress was pleasant enough, and even kneeled down next to me to show me which items were friendly. We told her at the beginning of the evening that we were paying our bills separately, as the manager told us to do exactly that when the reservation was made, and she assured us it was no problem.   However, she failed to let us know that she was nearing the end of her shift. Halfway through service, she seemed to be tag-teaming with another waitress without letting the other waitress know about any of our needs. I had my menu taken away 3x, even though I was clearly still reading it.   - Not a huge deal, I guess. I get things abruptly taken from my hands all the time because people assume I'm sleeping, but really it's because I'm Asian. -   Waitress 1 didn't pass any of her notes to Waitress 2, Waitress 2 seemed frazzled and awkward and by the end of the evening was taking out her frustration on our table. She seemed really annoyed that we wanted separate bills, and her solution to this was to hand us separate bills for food, but one bill for drinks. The above sentence took 20 minutes. I know, because I kept checking my phone as I had another event to get to. The gratuity was included, so I paid my bill and after the debit machine made its loop around the table; headed out the door to change in to an outfit for my other engagement.  15 minutes later, I walked back and noticed my friends still standing around inside the restaurant. I went inside to say goodnight, and heard they had been accused of short changing their bill by $62. As I had witnessed each person pay according to the bills they received, this was clearly due to the waitress forgetting to include items on the bill. Remember, the 18% gratuity was included, as we were a group of 8, so it wasn't because someone forgot to tip. The waitress' confusion and frustration came to a head as other people in the group took out their phones and started showing her calculations as well as their receipts. How we could've been short $62 - UNLESS - items were left off the bill SHE prepared for us is beyond me. The recalculations by our table brought the total to exactly what we ordered + $3 so one of us offered our waitress a fiver, but she refused and kept insisting on the $62.  My friend voiced her disappointment with the manager who was brought in. He seemed irritated and did nothing to hide this, and gave my friend abrupt responses. Still, he too recalculated the bill, and also got the original total + $3, so again the $5 was offered. Again, we paid the bills we received, so we were NOT attempting to short change anyone, but the waitress was still confused, though the $5 bill was finally accepted.  ---  TL;DR This is an overpriced sushi joint with less than stellar service. Next time: Kinjo."}
{"text":"Japanese cuisine meets Spanish tapas. In reality, Japanese cuisine is already served tapas style with dishes such as sushi, tempura, and sashimi. However, I certainly don't mind (and appreciate) Hapa reminding the public and creating their own tapas-inspired dishes along side traditonal favorites.  Ebi Mayo...4.5 stars. Tempura prawns in a spicy mayo sauce. A very tasty dish, though I would've liked the prawns to have a bit more crunchiness. The prawns are coated in the mayo sauce but I've had this dish elsewhere where the tempura still retained its texture...perhaps the dish sat in the kitchen a bit too long.   Beef Short Ribs...5 stars. Excellent! Simply the best Japanese short rib dish I've ever had. It's not rocket science, just thinly cut short ribs grilled to perfection...crispy grill marks but still tender and flavorful. Even the fibrous tendon around the bones were easy on the palate. These were the tiniest ribs with the thickest layer of beef I've ever seen! The protein literally sticks out 3\" or more away from the bone.  Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps...3 stars. This dish isn't terrible but nor was it great either. I was looking forward to trying this but was left a bit disappointed. It's all about the meat (or filling) when it comes to lettuce wraps. The porkbelly was grilled nicely but just didn't have the flavor I was looking for. In fact, the porkbelly had very little flavor, at all. The protein was also too firm. A more flavorful braised and flash-grilled cut of porkbelly would've been perfect (think Ki Modern).  Buta No Kakuni...5 stars. Braised porkbelly in a sweet soy broth served with bao (steamed rice flour buns). Nice thick cubes of tender porkbelly. By themselves, the porkbelly doesn't have much flavor, but when you wrap them in the buns and dip them in the soy broth, it's heavenly! A fun and well balanced dish.  Wagyu Steak Bites...2 stars. Sautéed wagyu steak cubes served with a side of maple polenta and fermented serrano sauce. The steak cubes were surprisingly over cooked, well done at best. If Hapa corrects this, this dish would easily be 5 stars...here's hoping it was a one-time mistake. The sauce is spicy but flavorful; loved it! The polenta offers a nice escape from the rich steak and spicy sauce.  Dynamite Roll...3 stars. You can certainly taste the freshness of the tempura prawn, cucumber, kaiware, wasabi mayo, and teriyaki sauce; however, the sushi was extremely delicate. If you're not careful, the roll will fall apart on you. Here's hoping this was another one-time mistake, as I really like this place.  Green Tea Brulee...4 stars. A nice take on an old favorite. The brulee custard was a bit thicker than the original variety but was none the less tasty. The bites of brownie and raspberries were a nice touch."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Hapa Izakaya for his birthday lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  The place was 80% full when I had arrived. The OpenTable app allows for easy reservations so getting a table was quite easy.  The only issue I had was that even though I had mentioned it was my boyfriend's birthday, the restaurant didn't go out of their way to make the visit more memorable.  They didn't bother to tell him happy birthday which was something I was not impressed about.  Also, I had mentioned we needed to be back to work by 1pm, the server ignored my request so our food was brought out 15 mins before 1pm.  Aside from questionable service, the food however was delicious.  We had the seafood risotto ishi-yaki and Kojiro ramen.  The seafood risotto ishi-yaki was good but the dish wasn't what normal risotto tasted like.  The rice was creamy but on the dry side for risotto. There was an abundant amount of seafood but nothing that was qreally outstanding.  They served it in a hot stone bowl which adds a nice flavouring as the rice near the edges crisp up and gives off a subtle smoky flavour that brought the dish up a notch.  The broth of the kojiro ramen was very flavourful. The highlight was how Hapa was able to bring out the pork flavours in their soup. The cabbage was different but adds a nice texture and the chopped pork was good. I am glad that we had requested less garlic as the garlic flavours was perfect. But over all both my boyfriend and I found that all of their dishes from this and previous visits a bit too salty. However, the walkable proximity and the availability of decent ramen in downtown calgary, this is still my go to ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on vacation and were in Calgary for a day. Made it a point to eat here after seeing pork belly ramen on the menu. We were not disappointed. Walked 30 min. And were the first ones in the door and they were ready to serve, very nice inside. The noodles were so delicious buttery smooth and we did not look up or talk until we finished our meal lol"}
{"text":"Yes I became a fan of their Ramen. I had their curry beef Ramen. Absolutely delicious and bursting with flavors from beef curry. Good portion for one person. My husband had their shoyu Ramen and he said that was the best one he had so far too. What I really liked was they used chicken broth for their ramen which is rare in Calgary. We also tried their 11 spices paperbag shrimps. It was innovative , unique and TASTY! we both enjoyed our food. Our server was fantastic. Friendly and good customer service. I liked the interior. Good for birthdays, date night and casual dinner."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, amazing atmosphere. Everything on the menu is fantastic, the presentation is excellent, the employees are very knowledgeable about the food and the ambience is perfect.   I really couldn't ask for more out of a tapas-style dining experience. I've been to Hapa in Vancouver and this brings the experience to Calgary seamlessly.   Great job Hapa, I will be back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to check this restaurant out when a friend from out of town came visiting. We were looking for fun experience for our night out and were not disappointed. The service was excellent and we were well looked after by our server and the rest of the Hapa staff. Starving as we were, the food was good and we were excited to see that okonomiyaki was on the menu! It was delicious as were the spare ribs and the cold pressed tofu. Prices were a bit steep but we still had a great time on a quiet Tuesday."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for dinner and we ordered the following:   Beef Tataki Soba Noodles  Ebi Mayo (deep fried prawns in mayonnaise sauce) Dynamite RollYaki Udon  Beef Tataki (thinly cooked beef slices marinaded with lots of flavour) Ika (grilled squid) Kakuni Bun (pork belly bun) Oshinko (pickled vegetables) Coffee Brulee  Generally at these izakayas each person orders 2-3 plates to be full. This is also the case here. My favourite dishes of the night were the Beef Tataki and Coffee Brulee. The tataki was well seasoned in sauces, was nice and chewy on the inside and ever so slightly cooked on the outside rim. The other food items were standard fare but didn't stand out as much as the beef tataki. I'm pretty sure in Vancouver these might be called carpaccio but whatever My least favourite of the night were the Oshinko. I'm not sure what these pickles paired well with the best so maybe I was doing it wrong, but I think that money could be better allocated to dessert. The pickled vegetables were crunchy but maybe it'd be best to pair it with a rice dish.  The Kakuni Bun was interesting in that you are supposed to scoop up some pork belly, encase it in the provided steamed bun, and eat it with your hand. This was fun but the pork belly was a little too fatty for my tastes.  Now the dessert was something to behold. This coffee brulee came with some brownie and raspberry friends dashed with icing on the side so its not just a creme brulee. The custard was warm and smooth under the crusted top which gave a satisfying crunch as I broke through it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is well known in Vancouver, but new to Calgary. When I arrived on a Wednesday night the place was rocking with club beats and quite a crowd. Probably the best way to describe it is a bar with a Japanese-Korean fusion food. As such, they are open from 5pm until 2am, but the full menu is not available until this late. The bulk of their business right now is the after-work 5pm crowd, or the late night folks looking for somewhere to hang out on late at night.    As already mentioned the food menu is small, but all of the items I tried were delicious. The food portions vary greatly by size and at the time of night we arrived (one hour before kitchen closed) a number of items on the menu were sold out or not available. Personally, I would rather a small menu well done than a giant menu of okay food.   I would have given it a higher rating but the service was spotty - and our server was really inexperienced. Unfortunately for her, she was serving a table of servers, so the gaps became quickly apparent. The spottiness was not just in not knowing the menu (e.g. she didn't know which three beers they have on tap), it also included forgotten orders, ordered food that was no longer available, missing cutlery and long gaps at the table waiting for her. We didn't mind too much because we weren't in a hurry, but I have to question the management's choice to put such an inexperienced server on the floor."}
{"text":"I am from Vancouver and have been to the multiple Hapa Izakaya locations in Vancouver. Came here expect somewhat similar menu. To my surprise the menu is completely different from Vancouver. Not a bad thing. This place has sushi!. Vancouver location doesn't have this on the menu.   So I came here during lunch time and its not that busy. I noticed everyone here orders the stone bowl. So my colleague and I followed the crowd. So I got the Salmon or Chan Chan Salmon stone bowl. It was very delicious. Or maybe its because there is cheese inside. Cheese makes everything delicious. They put the sashimi grade salmon in the stone bowl. I made one little mistake saving a few pieces till the end and when salmon is too over cook it tends to be dry. But the first couple pieces was delicious. Overall, I liked the food. (The Vancouver location only has 2 stone bowl choices and this location has more than 2).   The place is not completely pack and its probably because of its location. It is in Beltline. Too boarder away from the downtown office. If you want to get sunshine and not eat in the plus 15 then come here."}
{"text":"All right crew.  Quick disclaimer from the top. I'm from Vancouver and have been to each one of the Hapa locations.  Ambience wise, the Hapa here in Calgary is on par. The waitresses and bar manager are lovely people, and they are always down for a good time.    I came by with a large group of dodgeball friends on a Sunday night (yes, dodgeball) and it was a blast. Drinks were flowing, and needless to say, we have an amazing time.  The manager hails straight from the Vancouver locations, so he knows what he is doing.  Sadly, if you speak to the Japanese food purists from Vancouver, the food here isn't the same. Fair enough. But Calgary needs this in the food scene as there is much more to Japanese food than California rolls and gyozas.    Oh and ramen.  Who can forget about ramen?"}
{"text":"Food ordered: beef tataki, negitoro with garlic toast, pork belly lettuce wraps, hapa roll.   In terms of menu,  nothing stood out as extra unique or different.  Atmosphere was comfortable, open, with cushy seat cushions.    Service was attentive tho inconsistent - sometimes within a span of 15 mins 3 diff ppl checked up on the table and sometimes no one for 30mins, but all were nice.   I normally don't talk about bathrooms but I appreciate that they were able to put 2 stalls in the girls loo - Thank you!!!!  Happy hour 5-6pm - has happy hour food menu, $4 beer (can't remember which one) and $5 wine (white/red)."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Calgary. I couldn't care less about it being from Vancouver, Calgary has a good sushi game, we weren't saved by Hapa!! Anyway, the place is nice inside, has cute waitresses, and they're all quite lively even when no one is there (Sunday evening). The menu is small, but we found what we'd like. The sushi and sashimi was good. The sashimi portions were small. Everything on the menu is more expensive than the norm in Calgary - I hope this doesn't become a trend. The Midori salad is quite good, and huge enough for a while table to share.  Overall it's good. We'll probably stick to Globefish in the future though."}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner on a week night. Place was quiet and we were seated right away. I've been to the Toronto location and this one also did not dissapoint. Amazing food. Ordered their beef strips, sushi and sashimi. Everything was amazing! From service to the food to the ambience."}
{"text":"As with many izakayas, there is a regular menu and a fresh sheet outlining daily features. I noticed that the menu seemed to be smaller than that in Vancouver (the menu has expanded since my visit!), but there was still a fair amount of options to choose from. In addition to ordering a la carte off the menu, Hapa offers a 12 course prix fixe menu at $35 per person and has a 'Hapa Hour' menu from 5:30-6:30 pm with certain plates offered at 50% off.  Our meal started off with the Bintoro ($12), which is a seared Albacore tuna sashimi in ponzu sauce. The thick cut slices of the lightly seared tuna were so fresh, and I loved the slightly tangy ponzu sauce. The greens, seaweed, and garlic chips were a great accompaniment to the fish. I could eat this tuna all the time.  Hapa Izakaya also has a decent selection of sushi rolls, so we went with the Kin Roll ($15) and Umi Roll ($15). The Kin Roll is made with asparagus tempura, onion, miso mayo, yuzu rind, and topped with yellowtail that is torched tableside. The fish is fresh, asparagus still slightly crunchy, and the sweet miso brings all the flavours together. The Umi Roll on the other hand is made with chopped scallops and avocado then topped with Ahi tuna and pickled onion vinaigrette. The Ahi tuna carries flavours similar to that of their ponzu sauce. The rest of the roll is less flavourful, but that allows you to taste just how fresh and sweet the raw scallops are.  When I visit izakayas, Takoyaki is always at the top of my list of things to order. The Takoyaki ($7.50) at Hapa Izakaya is on the fresh sheet, so unfortunately it isn't always available. However, if you get the chance definitely order it! These crispy balls of octopus in smooth batter are something you don't want to miss.  Finishing off our orders was the Spicy Pork Ishi-yaki ($12). Served in a hot stone bowl, rice is topped with minced pork, garlic sprouts, tomato, lettuce, spicy miso, and a raw egg. Similar to Korean bibimbap, this rice bowl is mixed up table side and allowed to sizzle in the pot. There was plenty of sauce to coat all the ingredients and the crispy rice. I loved the punch of spicy miso and garlic flavours, and it's a bowl of rice that will definitely warm you up on a cold night.  Offering something different compared to the traditional Spanish tapas, I'm sure Hapa Izakaya has been happily embraced by those who enjoy going for post-work drinks and small plates. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive, and it was a great upbeat environment to dine in. I'm a little sad that Hapa Izakaya hasn't expanded up to Edmonton, but there's always hope!"}
{"text":"I had to see what all the excitement was with this new Zapata in Calgary.  It definitely will be a nice, trendy place for hanging out and enjoying time with friends.  The menu has a nice variety and their beverage menu is quite eclectic.  Be prepared that the portions are smaller than the norm and meant to be shared.  We ordered an assortment of dishes: Ahi tuna Albacore Tuna sashimi Pork belly wraps Curry hot stone bowl Grilled Ika Dynamite roll Spicy tuna roll Japanese pickles Chicken karage  All had great flavor and came in timely fashion. Our table was quite small so it was packed with many dishes.   Service was prompt and friendly. We encountered a service issue where an incorrect dish was ordered and we received the Ebi Shrimp instead of the Chicken karage.  When we noticed, we advised the manager and he apologized and even let us keep that dish! The chicken karage followed shortly after. Great service recovery!  Be prepared that each guest is greeted loudly by ALL staff and also the same when you're leaving.   Great location,  great concept!   Arrigato Hapa!"}
{"text":"I appreciated the Sunday happy hour that lasted until 8pm. No need to rush.  They offered a good variety of tapas and drinks.   The food was ok. Not the best Japanese food I've ever had but still satisfying. And the kimchi on my mentaiko noodles made me a little suspicious that there was some Korean influence in the kitchen.   Overall a decent experience and the staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"I've never been to many Izakaya's in Calgary so I was quite pleased to see Hapa Izakaya pop up last year on 11th Ave SW.  As the art galleries and luxury home decor places that used to line Calgary's Electric Avenue start to migrate away, so comes the arrival of food places.  My friend and I were in for a late dinner.  We arrived around 8pm and the place was completely empty.  I'm not going to lie, walking into an empty restaurant is a huge turn-off, especially when it's also a place to have drinks.  Our stomach's ruled so we stuck to the plan: Japanese pub food and drinks to wash it down.  Our server immediately sat us and had an amazing smile and personality.  She was quite helpful explaining their drink offerings and specials.  We were quite happy trying new things:  HANABI ROLL- spicy tuna, cucumber, habañero masago, spicy sauce.  It was a delight to see them lightly char the tops off the pieces with a cooking torch.  The rolls were excellent.  TUNA AVOCADO SALSA DIP - chopped ahi tuna, avocado, tomato, plantain chips.  This was quite good.  Who would've guessed raw tuna, avocado and tomato would be a good dip... they did!  The plantain chips were nice and big to hold the dip.  The chip was not too sweet which indicated a good drying method.  We also tried another cold tapa made out of eggplant.  The eggplant was in some sort of cold broth.  It was quite interesting and enjoyable the more I tried it.   It pairs well with a drink.  I'm not sure I'd order it again though.  OCEAN IN A BAG - deep fried soft shell shrimp, soft shell crab, panko breaded oyster, shaken with 11 spices, served with grilled lemon (3 pc each).  This was great and perfect for sharing.  The spices weren't overpowering and the batter was nice and light. I ate the shrimp whole, tail and all! :)  The presentation is great too as they actually shake the seafood in a brown paper bag with spices in front of you.  We only tried these tapas but I am already curious and excited for the ones I'll try next.  P.S.  They mentioned a few times they are a chain that started in Vancouver. However, I'm not sure that really helps.  If the owners are listening, most Calgarians aren't hung up on what Vancouver thinks is good.  I know, it's about speaking to your credibility; however, wow us in Calgary and then be able to say you made a big splash in beef country."}
{"text":"This place just newly opened last week and has multiple locations in Vancouver. The atmosphere and dining environment is very modern and trendy. The food had its ups and downs, the beef tataki I found was quite small for the price while the pork belly lettuce wraps were absolutely delicious and a must try in my opinion!!   The reason why I give it a 3 star was not only because of the food but because of the service was a little lacking and our table was sticky, didn't seemed like it was cleaned properly."}
{"text":"Western / White people chef trying to do Japanese \"fusion\". The rice are overcooked with too much water. It is no different baby food, except it's hot and salty.  The seafood in a bag is a total rip-off, pretty much deep fried shrimp and oyster then shaken it with some herbs....  they didn't even deep fry it the Japanese way \"Tempora\".  It's like 5% Japanese, and 20% chinese and 75% self trained chef cooking.    If you like Cheese + Rice + soy sauce, give a try lol  Don't get rip-off. it's not very expensive, but you don't get the bang for the buck. Avoid \"Japanese Fusion\" it's a total failure around the world.  And I just back from Japan. Locals sticks to ramen, sushi, etc...  hardly there are any \"Fusion\" there. it's money grab rip-off created right here in North america."}
{"text":"Love their \"Hapa Hour\" weekdays from 5 to 6:30 pm. Excellent food and drink for very reasonable prices. Restaurant is great for big groups. One area for improvement is their tendency to be forgetful. They take our order but tend to forget to bring out our complete order and then charge for the item that was not brought out. This has happened on each of my visits (4 times). They are always very apologetic and willing to take off the incomplete order off the bill without any hassle or argument, but to increase the rating even more, I'd encourage them to improve the accuracy on this matter."}
{"text":"Go to a Japanese restaurant for the finest drinks in the city, some of the friendliest staff absolutely amazing Ramen. This place is a must go to for a business lunch or dinner with friends. I'm not sure how many times I've been here but each time has been more memorable than the last I have yet to have a bad meal here or have poor service."}
