{"text":"Great location in Whitby for fish and chips with sea views from most of the restaurant.
We got there early and were seated within a few minutes though none of the window seats were free. Service was reasonably efficient if a little cold we were handed a menu as we entered and after a short delay our order was taken. Tea, bread and butter were arrived promptly but there was then a wait of about 30min for our meals.
The food was good but not great and the portion of chips was downright stingy! Considering the cost of the meal which wasn't far off Magpie prices I'm afraid it really wasn't in the same league. So all in all okay fish and chips in a clean well located restaurant but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed squid, beautiful taste. Followed by local lobster and tiger prawns. Beautifully fresh. Good location and great venue for fresh fish."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, although a teeny bit slow. Absolutely beautiful view. The sea bass was, without exaggeration, one of the most delicious seafood meals I've ever had, and the sicky toffee pudding was terrific. (Other members of my party had the chocolate cake for dessert. It was pretty good, but not as good as the sticky toffee pudding.)

One note: they fry their fish and chips in beef drippings. This could be a plus or a minus, depending on your dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Very nice fish and chips. Great sea view, very busy place. Service was OK but not exceptionally friendly."}
