{"text":"It seems like Wednesday nights always end up crazy around our house.  #1 Brothers is our reprieve.  The staff is always friendly and they always get it right.  We are kind of peculiar about our orders and they never fail to please.

Just wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food; pizza, wings (best wings anywhere, anyday, and you can't beat $7 for a dozen!) Sandwhiches, salads, and basically anything else the gastronomic wizzes cook up. Everything I have tried is awesome, and the prices are very reasonable. 
The owners are a great bunch of people, and one of the cooks is from NY so he knows how to make a real pie. My fiance and I have been avid patrons for years and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"#1 Pizza place in town.I have been at all three locations and it is faboulous.I am closer to this location and Surprise,wings are unbeatable and super tasty.The cheapest on the area too considering that are fresh.These guys are always busy and I dont wonder why.They have the most friendly owners too.Love tham all.It always smells good and is clean.Love watching their fresh dough on the table.I have been telling everybody.The special 2 XL &25 wings for 33 is the best."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings.  Customer service is amazing!!  Worth going back."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Pizza Places back on the East coast. Wings are way crispier than normal. Pizza is perfect east coast/New York style pizza."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and their service is impeccable! The lovely lady is just so sweet and always has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"This place is my go to joint for pizza and wings. I always enjoy a good pint of beer while waiting for my order. The lady up front is very nice and always smiling. 

The food is good. Its a no non-sense straight forward old skool pizza, wings pasta place. 

Love this joint"}
{"text":"One of my local pizza joints that I can eat every week. This place has a great pie, and crispy wings. If you eat there in the restaraunt the crust for the pizza crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The wings are also best eaten in the restaraunt. They have a great assortment of fried food as well."}
{"text":"First off, the staff(not sure if it was the owner but I will assume so) were extremely nice. Very friendly and welcoming. Though the pizza was sooooo greasy It was pouring off it..and the crust was so thin I could hardly pick it up. Pretty disappointed as they're only down the street from my grandfathers house."}
{"text":"A good neighborhood pizzeria in the east coast style.Ingredients could be a little higher in quality but for the price,friendly service and most importantly a pretty good \"pie\" I don't hesitate to go get a slice or whole pie."}
{"text":"I had the pizza and wings combo decently priced wings were over cooked however :(. Owner was very friendly and attentive.  Pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"I've come here a million times for the pizza, which is awesome, but today I tried the baked ziti for the first time and it did not hold a candle to the pizza. There was something about the sauce that I personally did not like. Please take into consideration that I am a picky eater, so do not let this deter you from trying it yourself.

The soda is nice and crisp. You can tell they clean the machines routinely, which is also awesome. 

There was also a woman behind the counter who I had never seen before. The two regular guys are nice, but this woman's constant smile and sunny disposition just makes your day automatically better. If you don't go for the food, go to see her and have a brighter day for doing so."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have ever eaten, and this is my opinion and i have been to mang pizza and wings places. From my freshman year at la joya till now, i have been coming to this place for the past 7 years and i still plan on coming.

Their Hawaiian with medium wings and their ranch is by far the best!"}
{"text":"My boss recommended this place for lunch, so tried it out. I was happy to see a place that offered lunch for 4.00. I got the cheese slice, the salad, and a drink. .50 extra for toppings on the pizza,  but I was in a cheese slice mood. Let me tell ya...it was the best damned slice I've had since NY. I'm genuinely impressed. Nice even coat of cheese, thin layer of sauce, nice bite to the crust. I would have regretted getting the salad in place of a 2nd slice, but damit, even the salad was awesome! Crisp and fresh lettuce, some mozzarella, black olives, onion, tomatoes,  and a peperonchini were caressed by a yummy Italian dressing. I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I used to hang out here alot in my high school days, and when my wife and I were dating. I really like the place. It is a part of our community in avondale, people just like to chill here! The owners, and staff are all family. They are some really cool people, and like to get to know the people who walk in. I have become friends with a few of them.

Now about the food.

Most pizza places like this have a very different tasting pizza than your everyday Pizza Hut pizzas, but I really like the pizza here. It has a different taste I crave for sometimes but for the most part I mostly go to pizza hut. The wings are good but I've had better. Still good though! I think for the most part you should try it if you are around  town. I see some people LOVE this place, and some people who are like me and just come here when they crave that different taste."}
{"text":"My daughter ordered pizza there last week. I was reluctant to eat it based on the reviews here. I was very surprised by how good it was. The pizza had a wonderful flavor. She also bought wings which I am not a fan of but everyone who ate them enjoyed them. I will order from there again."}
{"text":"Honestly, it has been an extremely long time since I gad a good pizza. I live right around the corner from this place but have always chose to not go in for whatever reason. This review is long overdue, I have been to this place a few times now and I LOVE this place. Well, the pizza anyway, haven't tried anything else. Well, I did try the mild wings, which really didn't wow me at all. But the Sicilian Meat Lover's pizza rocked! Everyone who has any fondness of pizza needs to try this place out!"}
{"text":"We ordered a sausage pizza. It was not good. It seemed like they used some kind of breakfast sausage instead of regular Italian sausage. We won't be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Very very good pizza!!! We will be back!! Great service, very fast! Happy we chose here for our Friday night outing.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great pizza but not a fan of the chicken wings. You're charged if you want to have two different sauces for wings and they're small. Service is always great and good pizza."}
{"text":"Back in the old neighborhood, and had to stop in for a slice. Awesome as ever. Just can't get pizza this good in PV."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this place, as it's just down the street from where I'm working in Avondale. I have twice ordered the #2 special (slice of pizza with a salad and drink) and was not disappointed. It tasted good and was cheaper than going to the under staffed and over crowded SUBWAY next door. The lady behind the counter is extremely polite and has allowed me free refills on my soda both times. This is my new lunch place. I love it.  See ya, SUBWAY!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went into this place for lunch.  The older-older lady could not understand English very well.  We saw the lunch menu and decided what we wanted.  It was very hot in the restaurant. Must have been at least 85.  My daughter ask the older lady if the AC was on., she answer yes it is on.  It was really to hot to eat.  Anyway, I ask the lady if they had military discount.  She  proceeded to tell me the lunch menu is already cheap.  My daughter and I ask several times about a military discount for future orders.  There was a younger guy behind the counter and he said they do have military discount.  We ask how much would that discount be on future larger orders.  That old lady would not stop, she kept interrupting and saying already cheap. The younger guy looked like he was scared to death of this old lady.  I finally walked out, my daughter told the old lady, that she came across as rude to us.  She said, don't call me rude.  My daughter stated you came across as rude to us.  She just did not understand English.  The old lady would not let the younger guy speak.  WE  WILL NEVER GO INTO THAT RESTAURANT AGAIN.  MY DAUGHTER HAS NEVER BEEN THERE AND NEVER PLANS TO GO BACK NOW.  You need someone who can understand English behind the counter.  You  lost my business and my  entire family business.  All she keep saying was already cheap, at least she kept smiling showing off her new overly white dentures.  She told my daughter that they were only the employees.  I do not see what that has to do with asking about a military discount...LOST BUSINESS...AGAIN THE  OLD LADY DOES UNTERSTAND ENGLISH....That lady is causing you to loss business...you just lost about 18 people in my family for rude behavior and a very hot restaurant... Can not rate since we did not eat there, but I would give it a -10..Very bad service and rudeness on the old lady's part....good luck with keeping any business with her around. Who wants to go to a very hot restaurant and then have to pay for bad rude service?  Not me...."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and I enjoyed the flavor of the wings however they are tiny. Two wings would be considered one whole normal size wing IMO. I would order the pizza again if I was in the area but not the wings because I feel like they're ripping you off"}
{"text":"I won't get into the quality of the food or anything else after the experience I had the FIRST time I went here. I had just moved in to the neighborhood, right around the corner no less. It was the first place my family and I thought we would try in the area. 

We each ordered a slice of pepperoni and a soda. Their sodas come from a fountain but you don't get to fill it yourself. I get my soda and sip it. It's foul! Something is definitely wrong with their machine. It wasn't the normal issue that fountains have of distributing too much soda water in relation to the syrup. This was different. It was much worse. The soda had a strong chemical taste to it, and was not sweet. I go back to the counter and ask for another one, explaining that there was something seriously wrong with the one I got. The guy looks at me like I'm speaking Chinese and then asks me to wait while he gets his superior. He brings back the owner and I explain to her what is going on and ask for a replacement. She flat out says \"No\". I am taken aback. Confused, I think she must not understand the situation. I explain again. \"No, I can't\" is her response. I ask her to taste the soda, because the only explanation I can come up with is that she doesn't believe me. She refuses to taste it.

I have never experienced anything like this in my life. First off, we all know that these sodas cost about 10 cents to the proprietor. That is why most restaurants let you fill your own. But what is really upsetting is that this goes beyond bad customer service. I did not receive a soda. That's how \"off\" it was. Yet I paid for it. I was ripped off, over a soda that costs them 10 cents. After eating my slice (I had already paid for it), I walked out of the place vowing never to return. It's too bad, as the pizza is decent and the place is only 2 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Amazing New York Brooklyn pizza! Truly authentic one of the best in the valley! Get no toppings for true New York taste."}
{"text":"I'm just in the area for the day... Showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. I ate too much. This Brother's is not as good as a similar place on Peoria... But it was decent. I would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. My Pepsi tasted fine. The girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. I got my soda topped off before I left and I got two sides of ranch at no charge... The only thing I was out off by was that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why I needed two. If I had paid for them, I would have said something. I'm full, happy and ready for a nap... Oh! Need to show houses... 

I ordered the two slices of cheese and a Pepsi and my total was $4.38

Um I went to the bathroom before leaving,.. The door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... Hopefully they get that fixed!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza place in Avondale! Would have got 5 but they are kinda pricy in my opinion. No delivery either. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"So, my family and I had a long evening. We had some unexpected errands to run and needed a bite to eat. I didn't want to get fast food and I knew most pizza places make their pizza fresh. Upon entering Brothers I noticed they had 2-3 huge televisions, plenty of dining space, and beer on draft. My kind of place. They had a special for an XL pizza and 25 wings for $22. I ordered that plus drinks. I ordered a pint and a half of beer which was $5. While we wait for the pizza, I watched an NBA game. Our food came out hot and in a reasonable amount of time. The service was great. I kick myself for not taking a picture, but the wings looked sick. The sauce for the wings was great, but most of the wings were damaged goods. They were broken before they were cooked therefore they were filled with cooked blood which was GROSS. They were fried hard which was fine, but man, I had such a hard time getting past the BLOOD. At one point, I bit into a wing and was chewing bone because the bone for that wing broke into pieces prior to them cooking it. I am thinking they got this batch of wings off the back of an abandoned chicken truck or something. Even my kids did not want to eat the wings because they had dark spots on them. The pizza was okay. I will not be going back to this place because my two favorite menu items were not tasty. It stinks because the guys who served us were great. And they had other items on the menu such as pastas and calzones. But the pizza crust was hard to bite into. The sauce for the pizza was good though. Sorry, Brothers. Not a satisfied customer. I should have read the reviews before putting my car in park for this one."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. Never a long wait, when I call it's ready by time I arrive. Been going here for a while, always greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Would give them a zero star but can't.  Pizza is at a two star,buffalo wings were okay. Service was a 2 out of 10, ten being the highest. Front desk guy was rude.. STAY AWAY.."}
{"text":"One of The Best pizzas we've had in AZ.  We r from E Coast & love r pizza.  We r frequent customers...mostly pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly service. The pizza came out out in like 10 minutes. No WiFi but the place was clean and they had TV sets all over. Will be back."}
{"text":"great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW!  The pizza is great, the wings are yum, and the cheese sticks are goodness.  I like the pizza because of the thin crust, melting cheese, and great taste.  
Even when I get the pizza home, it is still HOT!  

Support a local business!!  The staff is extra friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for pizza in wings by far! Not only is the food amazing, the staff is the best you can ask for! I have gone to this restaurant for years and I have never had a bad experience. The ladies who work the counter are some of the sweetest and nicest people I've ever met! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place to go. We usually pick up and have never dined in. The place was clean the lady that was at the register was nice and kind. They use a better grade of mozzarella cheese and you can taste it in the pizza. We have only tried the pizza and wings on a couple of different occasions and really enjoyed it and will continue to go back"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try since its down the road, good value for large cheese pizza & 12 wings for $16. Pizza was delicious & wings was nice and mild,"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had for a very good price. The people who run the place are very friendly as well so it is always a pleasure getting to see them and catch up on how things are going. Great food, great service and great people. One of my favorite places to eat. Cheese pizza with hot wings"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Great Lasagna...and the wings are amazing as well. This place is tucked away but worth the hunt. Pizza was tossed right in front of us so we knew it was real fresh dough."}
{"text":"I love pizza, I particularly love pizza from places that I can relay on to be consistent. This is something that big chains other than Little Caesars forget. I want to go to a place this week and next year and want it to taste exactly the same. Brother's Pizza gets it! It doesn't matter if it's 2 days, 6 months or 1.5 years it will always be that reliable Brothers Pizza that you're looking for. The service is always welcoming and I cannot express how happy to find a location that will be the same when I go back. The only reason I did give 5 stars is because I have a favorite and couldn't do it. our of respect for Brothers I will not promote any other business on their page."}
{"text":"We chose pizza again after a bbq competition and 1 Brothers Pizza was a winner!  We started off with some chicken wings and we all agreed they were delicious...crispy and cooked perfectly.  For the pizza, I hadn't had a Sicilian style pizza in quite some time so we went with that...with pepperoni.  So good!  The sauce was incredibly flavorful and it really hit the spot.  My husband and daughter both said, \"Best pizza in Arizona.\"  I'm not sure that I would go that far, but it really was delicious and I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in about a year since we moved quite a drive away, worth every mile we drove!  I love this place  staff are wonderful, restaurant clean, pizza is amazing and the wings.... yum... I will never be able to say enough about how good the wings are.  I would come once a week if I could."}
{"text":"Very mediocre pizza. If you're stranded in the Brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the Circle K and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. To everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza."}
{"text":"We went tonight, thinking it might be kinda crowded, since it's Saturday.  It wasn't too busy...we went after 9pm.  The staff is really nice.

We had pizza and wings.  The BBQ wings were smokin' when they got to our table, and were really tasty.  Crispy and tender at the same time, just how we like 'em!  The pizza was fresh and delicious.  The cheese was perfectly melted and the crust was flavorful.  We also enjoyed their ranch dressing, with both the wings and pizza (we like to dip the crust into it).

Overall we really enjoyed our experience.  Next time, I wanna try either a sandwich or a dish.  But, tonight we were in a pizza mood."}
{"text":"Very good food ! Everything on the menu is delicious:) I recommend this to everyone ! Great customer service! Always a smile when you walk in."}
{"text":"Went here after someone recommended it to my bf.  It was Valentine's Day, and the place was empty at 9P when we arrived.  Figured people were out at fancy restaurants rather than a pizza place.  But that was perfect for us!  

The gentlemen working were very polite and attentive.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and some hot wings.  Both were delicious!  The New YOrk style pizza was nice and crispy.  The wings were actually really good, and I typically don't eat chicken on the bone.  We also had a couple beers.  Overall, we had a good experience.  We will definatley be going back.  Prob found our favorite pizza spot in the west valley.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't know how or why this place is rated so high. I've eaten at the other Brothers in Goodyear and mistakenly ordered from here. Cheap cheese and sauce out a can, not mention the ranch dressing resembled peppered milk."}
{"text":"They have been in our rotation of regular pizza stops for us for a couple years. I was disappointed in the past at the size of the wings, but the flavor was always pretty good. Just ordered last night for the first time in a couple months and was MORE than excited to see the new meaty wings. You guys just moved back up a couple notches in my book! Keep up the good work!

Service by both people at the counter was friendly and helpful. The check in coupon was gladly accepted. $5 off. Heck yea!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a few times and it has always been pretty great. 

The pizzas are just the way they should be, nice flavorful crust, good quality cheese and sauce, and premium toppings. We've had a wide range of the pizza, and the only one I can say I didn't really like was the sausage, but I'm not a sausage kind of guy. The Hawaiian is one of the best around. This isn't fancy pizza, it's just good solid pizza done right. 

Coming from Philly I like my pizza a certain way and this place always delivers. 

The wings are great! I love the texture, and the sauce ranges from a nice mild to a pretty darn hot! No veggies with the wings, but that's cool. I've also had the Pepperoni Roll & Calzones, and they are delicious! The dough is hand tossed, everything is cooked to order, and everything tastes great! 

The prices are pretty reasonable. The only think I can really think that needs improvement is the booths are uncomfortably small, and they should really look into using tables and chairs, or at least offer some more. 

#1 Brothers is quickly becoming my go to wing spot in Avondale."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza.  You can tell that they use better ingredients, so that justifies the higher cost.  I am indeed a fan."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out. I've read reviews that it's NY style and I do miss pizza from the big apple and can only have it when I'm visiting home, so finding a place that can answer the crave is definitely a plus. 

I came here on a Saturday night, around 9PM, and there was a family eating there and 2 other pairs of people who were either waiting on their order or just chillin with their beer. Since I just wanted to try them out, I asked if it was possibly to purchase a slice even though it was outside lunch hours. The lady taking the order asks her cooks if there's slices left, to which they did. I'm relieved, but I'm worried my food won't be as good since it didn't sound like it would be freshly made. I wait about 10 minutes and they bring my pizza to me. You can see for yourself in the picture... definitely NY style pizza!! It was thin, super cheesy, and *surprise* super greasy. What pizza is grease free and tasted decent anyways? The pizza was good and I wish they were closer to work since their lunch deals sound pretty awesome!! I wouldn't say their pizza tasted mind blowing or anything, but I wouldn't oppose having it again. I did give 3 out of 5 stars since the table I was sitting on smelled like they wiped it with something that should've been washed. Or maybe change out the water it came from (the little wipe bucket was right by the cashier), more soap maybe???... the smell wasn't overbearing though. There were TV's and selection of beers and my slice was around $2, less than $3. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that there is a good pizza place close by to my new home. Javier picked up a large Supreme pizza and 2 dozen wings.Everything was delivicious. The wings had enough sauce and the perfect amount of spice. And the flavor on the dough on the pizza was tasty. Supreme had sausage, pepperoni, onion, bell pepper and mushrooms. The kids picked off most of the toppings but we enjoyed everything on the pizza. We even had leftovers for Saturday night dinner and the wings and pizza were just as good reheated. Will be picking up pizza again from here in the near future :)"}
{"text":"This place changed since I left AZ in 2007. Wing quality has reduced dramatically. Though of course prices are relatively the same. Pizza is still okay, but if you want good settings, there are way better places."}
{"text":"I've tried a few other pizza joints in the Tolleson area. This one is a winner. Just a good all around pie. Eat here!"}
