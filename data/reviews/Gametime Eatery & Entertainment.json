{"text":"Be Warned. Do not visit in the evening with under 19 year olds. You won't get in unless they are accompanied by someone over 25 that must stay for the entire time. Also females better watch out for the white 30ish European security guy at the door. He asks if you have a boyfriend and wants your phone number. Very scary. This is supposed to be your go to guy for safety. Unprofessional, hope they bounce this guy out and rethink their Safety policy."}
{"text":"For those that live in the area likely know that this restaurant used to be Wacky Wing, which was a pretty good spot for those sports games and late night hangouts! Just recently they became Gametime Eatery, they basically just tore down a wall and expanded their gaming area and added Ax Throwing, which I thought was a pretty cool addition! I guess in a way it's kinda like a mini Dave & Buster's? (But a lot crappier - #sorrynotsorry)

The restaurant looks exactly the same, just with a slightly larger expansion. Ok food. Shitty service. 

I came here twice in a month for a birthday party and random hangout. Both times the service was very crappy. The second time around was even worse. They don't seem too knowledgeable about the menu, don't really show that they care about working there, little to no visits at the table to see if everything is ok, my alcoholic drink came near the end of finishing my meal (it wasn't even that busy - our waiter ended up making them himself instead of the actual bartender)....altogether it's just a different vibe and atmosphere after rebranding it. 

Would I come back? Probably not"}
{"text":"A place where it all comes together for an amazing experience.

It is a dining place, a bar, a games parlour all in one. The service was excellent with a guy called Batman serving us. Not dressed as Batman but with the name tag saying Batman. He was pleasant, witty, attentive, and knew his menu inside out.

The food was amazing and I found myself licking my fingers despite the occasion being our wedding anniversary. Batman suggested the wings with hot & honey and boy was it heavenly.

The place has a nice atmosphere and is separated into 3 sections; a dining section, a bar and a token gaming section. A perfect location to have a company get together or a celebration. Quite spacious.

Reasonably priced. Service Excellence to the core."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to wacky wings but the service here is terrible. Management really needs to step up with training and food quality before the place closes. 

Our server introduced herself and ignored the trainee, leaving the trainee to trail behind her. We ordered a gingerale and wine and the trainee had to come back to ask us even tho the lead server was taking our order of 2 drinks... 

The wine came and we poured our own glasses and noticed that the pouring bottle was cracked and leaking. They brought back a new bottle with whatever was remaining from the leaked bottle. We were shocked that they NEVER apologized and didn't even fill it up! 
Not only did they mess up on the wine, they messed up on the ginger ale, it tasted like soda water and color was clear. When we brought it to their attention they said they knew and will replace it in 15 mins. Why would they still serve it and not say anything?

When we asked another server for something they replied back with \"I'm not your server\" and continued to walk away. 

We went to check out the games and bought our game card. Half way through the night the server brings up a promo that if we buy through here we would save 20% . She had failed to mention the promotion when we asked if there were any promo and when we found out about it we asked if she could honor the difference but she wouldn't. I would NOT RECOMMEND coming here due to their lack of service and poor attitude."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I ordered 5 pounds of wings and they were all cold. I've never had wings as cold as my beer. My tequila lime habanaro was not even spicy so I had to request for hot sauce when it's on the \"hot scale\". Was charged for the hot sauce when it advertised hot and was not hot at all. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Since this place switched over to gametime  the service has went down hill, I waited 45 minutes before someone came to take our order and another 30 min to get the food, the staff is unprofessional and defiantly needs better training and an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Gametime aka wacky wings recently switched over to a new brand and as such has been completely re-branded. 

The focus before used to be on wings, sports and pool but now has shifted to arcade games and wings. 

This establishment is huge, with lot's of seating, lot's of screens to watch the game and lot's of menu options.
The service much like wacky wings is touch and go, but overall the servers are friendly.
The food is very tasty, but I was shocked and saddened that my favourite menu item from when it was wacky wings (40 creek bbq pulled pork sandwich) is no longer on the menu! Sad, sad days! 

Hoping gametime will up it's game.. (see what I did there? ;) and re-introduce old menu favourites because let's face it, EVERYONE loves pulled pork.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Was looking to eat wings when we saw this place near Dundas and Dixie. Became a little curious and decided to check the place out. Glad we did! Game time is divided into 3 sections: Dine-in, Bar and Games section. My friend and I decided to sit in the dine-in. Our server, Adam was friendly and gave some good decisions. He was quick and knowledgeable. He advised us on trying the crispy medium hot wings which was good. We also ordered P.E.I nachos for starters. Both dishes were good choices made by us. Overall the service, food and price made our visit worthwhile!"}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday night with 3 freinds the place was completely empty we walked in and they said we had to wait to be seated ! Ok sure ....
So we wait and get seated ! Lots of space as there was only like 6 people other than us .
Anyways the host told us to sit in this section cause the other waiter didn't have any customers so we did .
I ordered a round of beers and 4 shots .
We waited 25 minutes for our drinks yea 25 I had to time it after noticing 15 minuets into the order .
We then ordered food and quickly another round incase it took just as long and sure enough they didn't disappoint as it took another 20mins for 4 more shots to come out ! 
Now of this is the service we got with it being empty I sure would hate to see it when it's busy ! 
Instead of Tuesday or Wednesday wing night they do half price games ...Sure whatever ...
I rather eat wings then play games but to each there own . 
Anyways I hope they serve drinks faster in the future cause waiting that long is terrible service !
Other than that the place is clean big and they have lots of TVs to watch a game .
To bad service is poor !"}
{"text":"Want to brush up on your axe throwing skills? If so this is the place to go! Last night we booked an event for 7 people. The booking process was really strange as I called game time and they gave me an email address where I had to send a request to. The response back was fairly prompt and they said they actually had 0 bookings so we were able to get any time slot of our choice. I booked the axe throwing for 8pm thinking we could eat some all you can eat wings beforehand (but my late friends proved otherwise).

Upon arriving I realized that the session they told me I had to book (round robin tournament for 10-15 people) was an hour and a half in length and meant for a much larger group than what I had. Seeing this and hearing my grumbling stomach we decided to downgrade to the mini tournament $22.50 per person. This was only suppose to be an hour in length but they gave us a bit of a hard time switching to this type of tournament saying \"I don't know if we can do that\". Regardless it was done! Gametime only had enough staff for our group of seven to go axe throwing and so the growing crowd watching us play was out of luck for the next hour as they only had one employee working the stand (even though there were two more open cages). 

Just so you know throwing an axe proved to be really hard but we were lucky the guy helping us was really nice and gave us a lot of \"last chances\" during our practice session which I really appreciated. We really wanted to eat as we played but they only had a small table outside of the cages. Definitely something they many want to think about changing. Overall the axe throwing was a great experience. The rest of our time at Gametime was a different story.

When I first arrived I asked if we could reserve a table for when we finished axe throwing. The woman at the front desk told me no (and over the phone they told me no reservations could be made for a party under 8) I asked this question twice saying we would be axe throwing and so maybe we could get a pager so we wouldn't have to wait afterwards, again I got a no. My cousin then went to ask a girl lower on the chain of command named Rachel and she was GREAT she took our name and number on her hand and brought us back a pager. I was a little irritated that the woman running the front desk couldn't do this for me. Anyways when we finished axe throwing they told us that they had just given our table away so we would have to wait.... fine. We waited half an hour till 9:30 for a table which was irritating but whatever. When we finally were seated our hostess asked what we wanted to drink. We asked for a minute and she came back 15 minutes later, only after we flagged another waitress down. Our waitress came and took our order and again we waited 15 mins for our drinks. Let me explain that in the meantime people were being seated beside us with a different waitress and getting drinks and even food before we were even seen to order. The bar wasn't even busy to say that might have been an excuse. 

Moving forward we got our all you can eat wings as it was Wednesday and they were the best I had ever had from there (we use to go to wacky wings all the time). The wings were juicy and the tender and the seasoning was flavourful. My favourite being the 40 creek wet sauce. So mid-meal our waitress Jess comes to the table and asks us for refills we say yes and I ask for a box and I couldn't finish my first portion of wings, no problem right? Wrong. We waited another 30 minutes for her to come back at which point she comes without our drinks or my container and we are all full and ready for the bill. I had ordered a second Margherita and where was it? Well she ends up bringing my bill and I notice I'm charged for TWO. I explained that she only brought me one and she says \"well I will bring it now it's already made\"............. I just said no thanks we're leaving. I couldn't believe it. Between the time waiting for service and the crappy service received from the food portion of game time I was super unhappy to say the least. Gametime really needs to look for more staff or do a training session because they will likely lose a lot of customers from this type of poor service."}
{"text":"Came here for all you can eat wings with a bunch of coworkers, we went around 5ish and it wasn't too busy but the TFC game was at 730 and it picked up then. 
Games area was super clean/bright and all games were working which is nice as Dave and busters a lot of the games are broken. Nobody was playin tho which is weird. 

Wings - they're big and slightly breaded but not too much. We did all you can eat so 12 to start one flavour and then 5 after that each time different flavours. I started with garlic parm (wet) which was a mistake cuz it was like a mayo based sauce which bleh was gross. I wiped what I could off because the wings themselves were really good. Second round was spicy jerk and that flavour was spot on! 

3 stars because the garpar was such a letdown and the seats are big and chunky and awkward but I think I'll be back again for wings and games"}
{"text":"I was to happy to hear that my favorite wing joint changed things up completely. i decided to check it out, I mean most of it looks the same except it more arcade like now rather than a pool and wing joint.

they cut down the menu completely , but took out a lot of signature sauces that were 'favorites' before the change over happened.

there was no real difference in the size of wings, just that they had less.

the place looks the same, so I would still go there with a bunch of friends to watch the game, but its definitely not the same. 

sorry Gametime, it's going to have to be a 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"The Gametime Eatery has VR, axe throwing, pool tables, and an arcade area of games alongside their bar and restaurant style eatery. The VR experience is single player only which we were bummed about because we would have preferred a group VR experience. While we didn't partake in axe-throwing, there is a person there who will give you a quick lesson and there are four stalls where mini tournament axe throwing can occur. Looks much harder than they make it out to be. The pool area is really cramped. Tables are too close together and we were constantly bumping into our neighbours. Try to grab one on the outskirts. Balls got stuck a lot too, we lost our cue ball a few times and the only way was to literally throw all the balls in the holes to reset the table. Luckily the person in charge gave us a free thirty minutes of playing time for our troubles. The arcade games and pool tables require a loaded card to play. Game area was clean, albeit a little small. They had lots of classics like skeeball, basketball, connect 4 but not a lot of driving or first person shooter games. Prizes were decent and reasonable to redeem. 

As for food, we ate by the pool tables and service was quick and efficient. Ordered the boneless wings and they were very good. Juicy chicken with great sauce (can't remember which one we ordered). Also got the spinach berry salad (gotta have the greens) which came a bit wilted. 

Overall a good date spot for those in the area with lots of activities."}
{"text":"had a really good experience with a group of friends. 
what used to be wacky wings is now game time, and they made some great changes to the menu in my opinion. 
started off with the \"bag 'o' bats\" (not recommended) spicy crab dunkers (highly recommended) and 20 boneless wings (highly recommend) for the main course I had the baked 5 cheese chicken penne, which all the flavors and freshness blew my mind. the service was ok considering we were a party of 12, the 13% group tip was a refreshing change from the \"standard 18%\" but wasn't too happy that the lady serving us suggested that we could give more. 
the new menu is amazing and i can't wait to come back and try more items. 
the parking lot is massive, but on game nights/fight nights/weekend nights good luck finding a spot."}
