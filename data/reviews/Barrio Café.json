{"text":"I feel like part of the in-crowd whenever I dine at Barrio Cafe. This is good and bad: good, because I realize, as hordes of other people do, that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad, because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is, in its lust for a good meal, downright rude. One set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 p.m. Saturday opening. I mean, really, just get in line. Then, once we were dining, we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table. The waitperson, to her credit, remained polite toward them. Sigh, I'm trying a week night next time ..."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my girls on a Saturday night. Enjoyed the food, drinks, and live music."}
{"text":"There are nachos, and then there are Barrio nachos, a bit spicy for my tastes, but the toppings and tastes just do not quit.  That with so many tequilas to try, it will make your head spin, literally.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've taken everyone I know and love here. And no complaints from anyone so far. My Anglo friends like the food and so does mi familia.  Most people who are only famliar with Americanized Mexican food will not understand what is going on here. And those haters out there that think Mexican cuisine cannot be a fine dining experience, you can keep your 2 for 1 tacos made from questionable meat sources. If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja, Rocky Point and Cancun, you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors. The Chiles en Nogada and the Pato en Tamarindo are my favs. And with over 200 tequilas to taste, I look forward to tryng something new every visit."}
{"text":"I would give this place 100 stars if I could. I travel a lot for work and get to eat at some great places, and live in a great food city so a true 5-star review is tough to come by for me. I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the giant Rey Mysterio mural greeting me when we walked in!   The churros were absolutely to die for, the guacamole was absolutely incredible (coming from someone who actually HATES avocados and guac), and the Filetito torta was beyond good. Everything was cooked perfectly, the staff was great, and the drinks were boozy.  This will be my must eat at place every time I return to Phoenix in the future. Do yourself a favor, and definitely eat at this place!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time with friends & found amazing. All of us were all praise for the quality of the food served.  The only down side is cost & service - extremely slow. Also the description of the items in the menu are too cryptic to appear English.  But if you are ready to really wait that long,  have got patience (& lots of money ;P )  then you won't regret dining here."}
{"text":"Well.. One thing I can say about this place is that there comes a time when you become so popular and so famous that you forget about what makes you good:  great, accommodating service. I asked for a simple drink and even showed them the recipe- a michelada Cubana, which is simply beer and Bloody Mary spices without the tomato juice. Simple accommodation considering that the regular michelada (with tomato juice) is on the menu. The waiter acted as if I wanted something extra special, and told me that he could not accommodate me??? What?! I guess he forgot how much he was charging for a plate of his restaurant's award winning food... He forgot how much we waited for a table, he even forgot to check and see if he actually could attempt to accommodate my needs. He said \"I will get you the regular michelada, and you don't have to pay for it if you don't like it\" which he promptly forgot about. I left that joint,  went down the street and got everything I wanted, with better service at half the price.  Olé!"}
{"text":"Nice service and atmosphere but the food .. The food is just EH.. I got the enchiladas del mar and it was covered inside and out with so much cheese you couldn't even fully enjoy the seafood or the delicious cream sauce. I started to feel sick eating it and even more annoyed that it was almost 30 dollars for this plate! My fiancé got the cochito pibil torta for 14 dollars ,which was okay.. It was skimpy on the protein and you could go anywhere else and get a comparable quality torta for half the price. They definitely are taking advantage of the food network exposure.."}
{"text":"This is certainly not your typical mexican restaurant with classic tacos/burritos and a side of refried beans.  This place redefines mexican cuisine.  Instead of nachos/salsa, they gave me small slices of bread and some sort of chopped olive salad.  It was a refreshing change to say the least.  I forgot the name, but I ordered the steak filet covered in crab meat and smothered in a perfect amount of mole sauce I think.  Oh my that was tasty.  The flavor was so new to me that I can't even compare it to anything I had before.  The steak was cooked to perfection and even the side of veges was fantastic.  I got the crepe dessert which was equally delicious.  The only downside was the price but that's not really something to expect with this quality of food.  The place is also kinda on the small side so I'm sure it gets packed during rush hours."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch and service today, as always. It's been a go-to place for me since it opened - Silvana and her teams consistently deliver top quality food and ambiance.  Cochinita Pibil!"}
{"text":"Best Spanish food in America, hands down!!! I absolutely love & can't get enough of this place. You can't go wrong with anything you order for it is all absolutely fantastic. Your mouths & stomachs will thank you & be very satisfied after dining here."}
{"text":"We were all from out of town and one of the guys had researched the restaurant.  Frankly, we were reluctant to go inside as the place looked like a hole in the wall and there was no parking out front plus the neighborhood was somewhat iffy. Anyway, once inside \"wow\" what a pleasant surprise. The best Mexican food I have ever had. This is Mexican gourmet dining at its best! The wait staff was terrific too! We'll be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"It must matter when you go, or be inconsistent, or be a matter of expectations (this is contemporary central-southern Mexican), or maybe the place is declining in quality, because the negative comments just are not consistent with my experience.  I've been twice at lunch time (December of 2005?, and November of 2007).  Neither time was busy (maybe that was key).  Portions were never small.  Ranged from good to great, with a couple of snags.  First time was the best.  I wanted huevos rancheros, but order didn't get to the kitchen in time, but the posole and some sort of pork tacos I ordered instead (yes, I like pork) were awesome so it was okay, and I still dream of the best caramel filled churro I've ever had (the flan was not so memorable).    Second time, my tamarindo was fermented, so ordered a mexican coke.  Queso fundido was good.  Posole was good, if maybe a little bland compared to the last time.  I think I had tacos with some sort of porkt again, which were maybe a little disappointing compared to my previous visit, but I'm not sure because I was uncomfortably full at this point.  My dining partner was very happy with the chicken w/mole.  Poblano mole is not my thing, but I sampled it (spicy, chocolaty, and good in my uninformed judgment)."}
{"text":"terrible. overpriced and overhyped. i dont understand why everyone raves. i wanted to like it but they gave me a number of reasons not to.  the special guacamole is $11 and when we went for dinner, the waiter put dried cranberries in it instead of pomegranate seeds and didnt say anything until i asked why. he said they were out of season. then change the menu and dont charge so much for nothing bigger than two servings of chipotle guac with cranberries sprinkled in. and chipotle guac tastes better.  the pork (i wanted that house specialty chicken but it was out os season or something too), the tacos, the churros were nothing special and not worth the $60+ bill at all. if there are seasonal differences to the menu, note that. also, dont overcharge. its very insulting. i think less people feel pressured to write good reviews in gilbert, where the barrio queen is getting what i think are very honest reviews on their prices and lack of quality."}
{"text":"A small storefront and easily missed but once you enter, the atmosphere is great. And the food was absolutely incredible, we had the Cochinita pibil and the torta de filetito and they were both amazing, perfectly spiced and flavored. And the flan was excellent as well.  Highly highly recommend Barrio Cafe and I plan to go back at the earliest."}
{"text":"Excellent flan! Mini tacos at happy hour were just the right size. Halibut fish tacos were our favorite. Yum!\""}
{"text":"Their not-strictly traditional chiles en nogada is one of Phoenix's best dishes. Too bad it's seasonal. GREAT tableside guacamole, puts the pretenders around town to shame. A decent selection of premium tequilas, great art on the walls (inside and out), attentive service. It is all good here"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me because of their amazing dessert:  homemade churro filled with dulce de leche, with a side of homemade vanilla bean ice cream with cinnamon and whipped cream on top.  Seriously - heaven on earth.  And, I will make an argument that it has to be somewhat nutritional?   I mean, there's cinnamon and milk - aren't those two items good for the skin and heart? :)  I could eat this every day and wouldn't even mind if I got fat because I'd be so happy.    The dinner and lunches have been pretty good as well -  I'd recommend Sunday brunch as the best time to go - it's not as crowded and they have a unique brunch menu.  Plus, you can still get the churro dessert at 11:30am and have the whole rest of your day to walk it off.   :)   Great place to take out-of-towners as it's been nationally recognized in several top publications."}
{"text":"Great food, fabulous margs! I highly reccomend the skinny marg not on the menu :)"}
{"text":"What can a say - Barrio is a winner.  The fish tacos, of which I am most certainly a conusieeur - are the best I've ever had.  The guacamole is fresh and delicious, the sangria is so favorful.  The best part of the place is the ambiance, the feel, the live music on Saturday night, the artwork inside and out.  There are awesome murals in the back parking lot area - great for photo ops.  True Arizona, great quality."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate here last night. We shared two appetizers and three entrees. It was simply the best food I have ever ate. The service was spot on and the live music was not too loud. Made for a truly enjoyable and memorable meal. Outstanding"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon with my wife. It's not your typical Mexican Restaurant.  The cuisine is from Central/South Mexico.  I loved everything about it.  Great flavors; deep and complex in every dish.  The table bread was served with a tapenade.  It was well balanced and I finished it all.  My dish was grilled chicken with a creamy buerre blanc, topped with goat cheese and pine nuts along with grilled peppers. Very flavorful and smoky. Would come again."}
{"text":"Amazing mexican food in a fun environment. The lowrider margarita and the staff are both fantastic!"}
{"text":"Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention.   On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. The chile nogada will blow you away. Margaritas are very good as well. Customer service is great. Cesar was our server and he was very attentive. Place is clean and feels very homey, but a little small, especially for a big party. Definitely recommend this place and give it a five stars all the way"}
{"text":"Home of the $200 Torta!  O.k., not really.  But I got your attention, didn't I?  While in Phoenix for the holidays I wanted to take my in-laws out to a traditional Mexican meal.  Such is Life has apparently closed, and it was always my staple when I wanted to take friends and relatives to an \"accessible\" meal that wasn't Macayo's, Garcia's or Carlos O'Briens (for the record, none of these place is Mexican...Tex-Mex, yes, and I love them all for that, but it's not the same and you know it).  So while searching for an authentic experience that didn't entail a day trip to visit La Roca in Nogales, I came across this little gem in Central Phoenix  What grabbed me on the menu was the entire section of tortas.  Now THIS is my kind of place!  To open we had guacamole (of course), and it was really flat.  There was no serrano, and I'm not sure if there was any jalepeño.  If I'd stopped here, they would get 1 star.  But they stayed in the game by bringing us two orders of Lobster Quesadillas.  This dish is creative, decadent and decidedly Mexican.  Bravo!  Since the in-laws had never experienced the majesty that is the torta, I thought we'd order four and split them so everyone could gain as much as exposure as possible.  We did the following:  Cochinita Pibil:  According to Robert Rodriguez, this is Johnny Depp's favorite ;).  Barrio Café's take on this venerable Central Mexican staple is solid, and I would definitely order it again.  Pollo y Jaiba: Wow!  A grilled chicken breast topped with lump crab meat, avocado, Oaxaca cheese and Hollandaise!  Absolutely classic, and exactly what I was hoping to share when I chose this restaurant.  del Barrio:  Essentialy a roasted Chile Relleno.  My least favorite, and yet it was just far enough outside the box so as to present a new experience while still maintining a sense of familiarity.  de Filetito: The belle of the ball.  This one is a sliced filet mignon, topped with chorizo, blue cheese & chipotle sauce.  Good God, this was amazing.  My father-in-law ate most of my quarter, so I only got 2 bites.  But these two bites, the last of my meal, were the best!  The tequila and beer selections were accommodating without being daunting (no one really needs a choice of 200 different tequilas, do they?).  The shortcomings are in the way of things totally unrelated to the food.  The service was dismissive and the ambiance was like the guacamole (flat, remember).  I'd really like to give them 4 stars, and as I'm looking forward to returning soon, they may just earn that 4th star in a follow-up."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Aaron was our waiter. Properly attentive, never seemed rushed even though he was very busy, knew the menu like he created it.  Drinks were outstanding. The La Picocita Margarita, Arbol chili infused margarita was one of the most delicious cocktails that I have ever had. Simply wonderful.   The bread and peppers that they put on the table was outstanding. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, not unlike a french bagette in New Orleans.   Pomegrante Guacomole was excellent. The poms added a nice texture and wend very well with the perfectly ripe avocado. I would have preferred that it was a little less \"rustic\" but the application of a fork made it perfect.  My lovely bride was very happy with her chicken suiza. It was well constructed and a solid dish.  My Del Mar was a little overcooked and I found the creme sauce a little flat.   My dish notwithstanding, it was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"For East coast travelers, note they don't serve lunch until 10 AM Phoenix time.  House made horchata is a sippable rice pudding iced drink that taste great with the pancakes. The pancakes were unremarkable. The syrup was unique. It was extra thick with cinnamon and other spices."}
{"text":"Barrio Café is amazing.    The tableside guacamole is to die for with the addition of dried cranberries.  Menu selection was very different from regular Mexican restaurants and a  welcome surprise."}
{"text":"Not your average Mexican food. They make their own mole sauces. Stuffed chiles are incredible. Many good fish dishes. Pasole is great. Been there many times . It is the barrio, but great food. Only problem is, always busy and a wait."}
{"text":"I never thought Mexican or Hispanic deserts are so good until I ate flan and some other cake/ice cream thing. Horchata I drank 3 bottles of those. Delicious. Chicinato phibil slow cooked pork is so good. I liked the garlic sweet potato too. Pomegranate gaucamole is a must try thing here."}
{"text":"Not your usual Mexican fare! We dropped in on a Saturday evening without reservations and were seated right away. There was live music, but it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation at our table. The food is very good and unique.  For example, the guacamole made tableside contains cubes of avocado, chopped red onion and cilantro, lime, and pomegranate seeds. I had a delicious torta with chicken, poblanos, and onions - my daughter had beautiful chicken tacos.  The prices are not inexpensive, but the portions are huge!  The atmosphere is fun and although the neighborhood looked a little iffy, we felt comfortable parking in the back and walking around the corner."}
{"text":"Several years ago, 3 or 4, discovered this place and although prices a bit high, the food was great as well as service, therefore enjoyed a great meal here a couple times every year.  I like trying a restaurant several times before I review it.  2 stars for flavor and enjoyable live music, however the prices are a bit high, service can be inattentive and slow.   It's been about a year since my previous visit and the menu appears to have updated. Along with most if the previous items there are now some less pricey options, however taste no longer justifiable.  Don't know what it is but it feels and tastes different.  Not sure that I'll go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience!   Started with an amazing tequila drink and guacamole---fresh! They make it table side!   I ordered the pork tacos and a side salad and my food was flavorful, hot and the perfect portion.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  The food was great and the margaritas were really interesting!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! My frozen margarita was delicious as well! I loved watching the staff- they are very professional, but man do they move around fast! Very hard workers! We had the flan for dessert and it was probably the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. I thought the food was WAY overpriced, but it made sense once I looked around. The majority of the people were not Mexican so they might not be aware that a large pitcher of Horchata could be made with even less than $5.  When I visited, a Coke bottle of Horchata was almost $5. Nevertheless,  I thought I would give the food a try because it did look good.  The manager was our waiter, and I asked him what Longaniza was. He said he didn't have time to explain what that was.  I'm sorry for wanting to know what I was going to eat. I didn't know if I should laugh or just walk out.  In the end I walked out and went to El Guero Canelo on 51st Ave and McDowell.   IF YOU'RE LOOKING UPSCALE MEXICAN FOOD CAFE POCA COSA IN TUCSON!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant experience ever.  Service was friendly, welcoming, efficient and fast.  Without a doubt the best filet I've ever eaten, large portion, melt in your mouth tender, rampant with flavor, and cooked to perfection ordered rare. If you have dinner here, and have had a better dinner elsewhere, please let us know where, so we can all go the here too."}
{"text":"The most delicious meal on my recent trip to Phoenix.  The homemade tamarindo was incredible and the guac was fresh and tasty, though the cranberries messed with my mental expectations to the point of distraction.  For those vegetarians out there who don't cheat with fish like I do, try asking for the chile relleno without the seafood.  It came piled with roasted veggies and the cheese alone should be enough to satisfy."}
{"text":"Wonderful food I was eager to try Barrio Cafe as I recently hit Barrio Queen in Scottsdale with a friend.  Very different atmosphere, this is a tiny place with a more formal menu.  We arrived relatively early on a Friday night, around 6, and were seated immediately.   I was a little disappointed that (unlike Barrio Queen), they don't have beer on tap.  The food was wonderful, we had the guacamole with everything, which was interesting because they added pomegranate seeds.  Next time I'd ask for the guacamole to be a bit spicier, but it was wonderful.  My date had a pork torta, and it was wonderful.  I had a poblano dish (can't remember the name), which is seasonal, and filled with chicken, almonds, apricots I think, and some cheese and cream sauce.  Absolutely incredible, sweet and savory, spicy and smooth, in every bite.  My entree also came with a side of steamed veggies and some chipotle mashed potatoes, which were smoky and very flavorful.  I would definitely recommend Barrio Cafe and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Barrio Cafe is a fucking unreal dining experience; But at first glance, you'd never know it.   Barrio is a tastefully decorated, two-room restaurant located in a predominately hispanic area in central Phoenix just off of Thomas and 16th St.    Normally I would never recommend a restaurant located next to a 99-cent store, but Barrio Cafe is a rare and treasured exception.    My wife and I went with friends who were regulars and gracious enough to pick up the hefty tab.   Our friends described the cuisine as French-Mexican fusion cuisine, a term I happily blended into the cheerily trite \"Frexican.\"   In realty, I'm not sure that I detected the French elements.  Sufficed to say, the food does adopt a central Mexican, colonial flair.   If I were liken the type of cuisine to any previous experience, it is most like that of the Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson though with a less traditional feel.     Barrio has an extensive and seemingly well-formed wine list which I did not personally avail myself of.  I enjoyed a smooth and tasty import beer called Sol.   As a side note, I strongly recommend Sol to anyone who likes Tecate but feels bad about drinking Mexican swill.   Sol is to Tecate as Allison Krauss is to Dolly Parton--All the same fun without the white trash guilty feeling when you're done.   We enjoyed a delightful Guacamole and chips appetizer.  Though still chock-full of advocados and the accompanying calories, Barrio's guac-fare also boasts nuts and apples and some other unexpected ingredients which lend the guac a sweet and light flavor that makes you feel like you're eating healthy whilst clogging your arteries, a ruse I always appreciate.      For dinner I enjoyed their filet mingon which was served with a goat cheese and crab meat topping on a bed of well-prepared red peppers and other ingredients I just cannot recall.  In addition to preparing the meat as ordered (MR), Barrios beef was flavorful and tender as one would expect from the Filet.   I devoured this.   I was hungry and it was so incredibly tasty I didn't do a good job of savoring, I just inhaled it.    We enjoyed a churro with whipped cream for dessert.   A churro.   Yes, a churro.   What can I say except: Churro?  Fuck Yeah!  Seriously...go.   But, bring your credit card because you'll average $30/head without even drinking.   Budget on 50-60/head if you're drinking."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time!  Once we got past the neighborhood and into the restaurant, we knew we were in for a treat.  We starting with the guacamole with pomegranates and terrific margarita.  I loved the twist on the guac.  Then the real highlight was the Chiles en Nogada. Our waiter recommended this dish.  Reading it on the menu, it didn't sound good, especially because I don't usually care for cream sauce.  However, this is one of the best dished I've had in the USA.  The combination of flavors was truly outstanding!  We also had the slow roasted pork which was delicious, but not nearly as unique as the chiles.    Then to top it off the deserts were insane.  We ordered the chocolate cake and the churros. Hands down, these churros were amazing!  The decadent carmel sauce was rich and a perfect accompaniment for the churros.  These were even better than Rick Bayless's churros in chocolate in Chicago.   All in, my husband, who's a big foodie, and I had one of the best meals we've had."}
{"text":"Pollo Poblano, mmmmmmmm. This is a cool joint. White tablecloths, sweet murals, delicious meal."}
{"text":"The food was great! Bread and Olive spread is wonderful. The place itself was beautiful and the food was incredible! Well worth the money"}
{"text":"I do not at all understand any review of fewer than 5 stars.  This place ROCKS.  Great Art!  Great Mission!  Great Food!  Great Micheladas!!!!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Quirky interesting place!  Had brunch and there was some good live music.  My entree was chicken enchiladas verde with an egg on top and potatoes on the side.  It had excellent flavor.  The queso fundido was also good.  Good service and nice people."}
{"text":"Our car's driver side window was smashed as we sadly observed when we finally made our way out of this restaurant (hours later)on this less than stellar evening..we spent yet more time cleaning glass off of the seats just to FINALLY get to drive away from the Ghetto cafe..er Barrio cafe...but I digress..  I don't know.... I guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a Saturday and doesn't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right? You think? Wow..I am actually embarrased I fell for this. This must be what the people who bought Charlie Sheen tickets felt like...  Sucker! That is what I felt like last night for sure. First off, we had swung by here a couple of different Saturdays but (smartly) decided the wait wasn't worth it...my bf really wanted to try it ( be careful what you wish for)..so we got there (early for us) around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the CRAZY hour and 30 minute waiting game...did I mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm....  Ok..so the food portion of the review...two words...mediocre and overrated...the guacamole was salty...i didn't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server (who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet)...literally couldn't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table...our main dishes...were just ok.....nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation...thank goodness for the wine....  This is probably one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to...I was thinking no way will I be returning..that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage...wtf? Maybe if you took reservations Barrio.. and had a decent parking situation..people wouldn't be sans their car for 3 hours just to eat dinner in the hood."}
{"text":"I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy."}
{"text":"Due to the shatty location of this place, I will only go during broad daylight. Besides that, this place is the freaking best mexican restaurant I have been to. Ever.  It is the Kreme on my Krispy!  This place is a breath of fresh air in a city full of chain restaurants and does NOT have a dissappointing item on its menu.    See you there!"}
{"text":"fish tacos are unreal, The Guacamole is exceptional as well. The service is great, dishes are unique and super authentic. The drinks are well priced and always delicious. Barrio Cafe delivers all the way around. Hands down, best Mexican food in the area...possibly, the world. They leave nothing to be desired. I always leave this place feeling full and happy. The next day, I'm craving for more. It's so good, I have to continuously remind myself the concept of moderation. I've even tried to replicate many of the dishes and they never seem to measure up. I don't know what their secret recipes are but whatever they're doing, they're doing it oh-so right."}
{"text":"My mother was in town visiting so we searched yelp to find one of the best-rated Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, came across reviews for Barrio and decided to try it out. So glad we did because it was amazing, the food was so delicious we kept eating well past the point of being full. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Art work and outdoor murals were awesome, although the food was not authentic mexican food like we thought.  I think my wife and I had expectations that this place was going to serve typical \"barrio/authentic mexican\" food, frijoles, arroz, etc.  What we received, was what we ended up calling \"Retro Mexican\" or food that one would find in a posh, trendy, upscale yuppie neighborhood. I about spit out my iced tea when one of the other customers asked for \"Mexican Wine Juice\".... WTF!   I looked at my wife and was like what is \"Mexican Wine Juice\"?  Its called Sangria you DA.  Don't get me wrong, it is good to see that the ghente running this place are doing well, but it just wasn't what I expected.  The area was nowhere near sketchy like one of the previous reviewers posted, but then again if you are used to or are from Beverly Hills CA, Cherry Creek CO, Scottsdale AZ or any posh area it might be for you.  As for the food.  I had the Torta de Filetito.  The filet was cooked perfect but the spices were lacking something, Some spicey chile maybe?!  The iced tea was good, and the steak fries dipping sauce was different. Kind of like a lazy attempt at spicing up the ketchup.  The portion size was enormous and was a bit pricey.   The good thing is, is that price evened out to two meals had I gone and bought dinner that night.  The waitstaff was awesome and on-point.  As one of the reviewers below stated this place gets stars for all the little things murals, waiters, artwork, etc. but the food is definetly not reflective of the \"Barrio\"."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad to celebrate graduation, and had a fantastic meal. Guacamole with pom. seeds was so good! Everything tastes fresh. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just a crazy New Englander, but this place was nothing special...  First of all, they serve stale bread and some sort of roasted red pepper spread at your table.  Sorry, but it just doesn't go...  Inside is super loud...they've got speakers all over the place and it's not a big restaurant.  Live music is a nice thought, but it's literally deafening.   Food is just not good.  Tacos were bland.  Table side guacamole has a \"kitchen sink\" recipe and uses avacados that aren't even ripe.  Also had a vegetarian dish that was just roasted veggies covered with a ton of cheese.    Service was not good either.  Waiter forgot what we ordered (writing stuff down would be OK by me...) and stuff came out slow.    Definitely wouldnt go back..."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on a business trip and wanted Mexican food. What I enjoyed was beyond belief. Who knew chicken could taste so good. Very interesting favor profile and textures, excellent service, really interesting art (both exterior and interior)  and a chief. Who is both talented and modest. This is NOT your standard street Mexican food. This is solid cooking, fresh ingredients and no pretense. Go there and enjoy."}
{"text":"Best birthday dinner ever! A group of girlfriends and I went to dinner here to celebrate my birthday and it was perfect. I love Mexican food which helps of course, but the atmosphere, food, and service were all awesome.There was a musician playing who had played a happy birthday tune for me even! I look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent enchiladas Suizas, queso fundido was so colorful and flavorful.   The serving portions are perfect, I saved some for dinner so I can enjoy the food twice in one day.  Since I left Texas I've yearned for that perfect culture food, destination reached. The atmosphere is happy, colorful, fun. Totally reminds me of my Texas roots.  Will definitely be returning here especially when the family comes to visit"}
{"text":"This place sucks so bad. I came on a Friday around 4 with 3 co-workers. They were still some tables open so we were seated right away. Everything after this point was just horrible. Took a while to get drinks. Took even longer to get food(over an hour...) We all ordered tacos. The server did not want to give us the happy hour deal even though we were clearly there during happy hour. Finally he gave it to us.   On to the tacos, they sucked and there was NO consistency. I ordered the same tacos as a co-worker and hers came with sauces while mine were completely dry. We attempted to order a second round of drinks but they never came.   It was just a horrible experience and I'm glad we just went for the happy hour prices. Normally the tacos are $13. That is crazy. There are much better Mexican places close by."}
{"text":"This is not a typical Mexican place. Instead of chips & salsa they serve bread with tapenade. The food is amazing!  The service was perfect. We got there at 11:30 for lunch. Any time after that you will have to wait. The street art in the back is worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place was amazing all around! It had great atmosphere, great waitors, and the best food and drinks!!! I'm definitely going there again and again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A little expensive but great food and service! The service is quick and courteous, the holiday decorations are super festive, and despite how busy and packed it always is here, the dining room is always clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Excellent food and well worth the drive. I had the enchiladas suizas for a main course and absolutely loved them. Guacamole is tasty, with pomegranate mixed in to the avocado mix. Service is very good, too."}
{"text":"I was blown away by Barrio Cafe. I got the Chiles en Nogada, which is the Chef's signature dish and am not sure I have ever put something more delicious in my mouth. The atmosphere and the service were amazing! Will be back."}
{"text":"We ate here for brunch and it was wonderful!  We had 2 different kinds of tacos and a delicious beef sandwich.  Everything looked good which made ordering take a while.  We also had a very strong but very good margarita.  We wanted to have a large party there for our wedding (21 people) but there was simply no room so we had to make other plans."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a needle in the haystack as far as location goes. In the most unexpected of downtown areas, this cafe blends in on the outside but stands out with it's relatively classy interior and of course, with it's delicious food. There are few vegetarian options but the cheese enchiladas with roasted vegetables on the side came in a big platter smothered in gooey cheese and warm goodness. My brother had some meat dish but as a side were chipotle fries which were golden on the outside and the inside (quite possibly some of the most delicious fries I've eaten). They also serve a guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it which was surprisingly good paired with what seemed to be home-made tortilla chips.   We went there for Sunday brunch (for which they have a special menu) and although the prices are a little up there, the portions of the food are in line with the cost.   Con: Small/tiny/closet sized bright red bathroom."}
{"text":"GO HERE.  I moved to PHX a year ago and had never been.  My mom came to visit, so upon the recommendation of coworkers, I took her here.  WOW.  First, the complimentary tapenade and baguette was verrrry tasty.  We also ordered the guacamole - we aren't big salt-eaters, so it was a little salty to us, but the FLAVORS.  So good... tiny diced red onion, cilantro, pomegranate seeds...  amazing.  We both scoured the menu, which looked great, and coincidentally ordered the same entree - - enchiladas suiza.  Again, so many different flavors that were just perfection.  Zucchini was huge and perfectly cooked. The dish was a little rich, but the flavors were out of this world.  What we couldn't eat we took with us.  We went on a weekend and there was a guitar duo...  we cracked up at the Mexican version of a Bob Marley song.  They were great.  The artwork is pretty cool... even in the co-ed bathrooms there is interesting artwork to see.  The people at the table behind us kept raving about the mole sauce.  I'll definitely be back to try it.  :)"}
{"text":"My party of 5 dined at barrio on a Wednesday night and had a nice dinner, including a fantastic order of guac.  The restaurant was very busy, so we had our well below average tasting margaritas on the front patio.  The 45 minute wait would have been easier to take had we received our guac and chips in a reasonable amount of time.  The bartender forgot about the order, so we didnt get them until we were seated for dinner, about 45 minutes after ordering them.  Our service once we were seated at our table was very good. Our server offered many good suggestions and the meal came quickly.  Overall, we enjoyed our evening and were pleased with dinner. The main issue was with the bar -- the solo bartender was very busy, so I suppose there was some justification for the poor service and poorly made drinks."}
{"text":"This place delivers on great Mexican food!  Not Mexican/American food that u get at every other place. I can only imagine that this is how restaurants deep inside Mexico do it. A unique palate and a way of combining things u don't normally think of but that make for delicious combos. I haven't eaten at every Mexican restaurant yet but so far this is my favorite.  Woot indeed."}
{"text":"Went here last night at my friends (the birthday girl) request and were very pleased. The restaurant is super cute and has a nice ambiance about it - beautiful paintings by local artist adorn the wall, live music and fragrant scents fill the air. The perfect atmosphere for a delicious meal!  Barrio Cafe does not take reservations. We had a party of six and waited around 10 minutes - not bad for a busy Saturday night. We started with the highly recommended Quesdalilla de Langosta Borracha (lobster on corn tortillas) - delicious and not too heavy! I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas (chicken with a tomatillo cream sauce) and tried my friends Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork). No complaints from anyone at the table. I could tell we were all savoring our meals as our table was actually quiet!   The waiter was kind enough to bring out a Flan de mi Mami in celebration of my friends birthday. Too bad we had brought a cake with us. I did manage to try a tsp of it though....nothing beats a good flan. :)  The only negative is the noise level. It was Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty full. The lively patrons combined with the live music in the background made it virtually impossible to hear my friends across the table and I have pretty good hearing.  I would definitely come back! I saw they have Sunday brunch and my stomach is already gurgling at the possibilities."}
{"text":"Why not more stars? While Barrio Cafe does indeed serve up some tasty good Mexican food...I was expecting to be blown out of my mind, but that didn't happen.   We started the meal off with a generous portion of guacamole...fresh & chunky with added touch of cranberry  Pollo En Mole was good but the mole sauce played only 2 notes sweet and hot, lacking the depth of complexity that I was expecting  The Cochinita Pibil was a major disappointment.  While the texture was soft and succulent (as per 12 hour slow roasting technique quoted in the menu), it needed flavor...we had to resort to giving a good dollop of hot sauce to finish the dish.  The Churros we ended with was delicious with goat milk caramel for an added twist.  However, thought that  the $9.50 price was a bit high for just 2 pieces.  Conclusion:  Good food, but just didn't deliver for the price"}
{"text":"My mom came into town and I wanted to take her to one of \"Phoenix's Best Restaurants.\" I did my google search and found Barrio Cafe. I read the reviews and found the photos to be inviting. Upon arrival we were welcomed by the host and told a 45 minute wait. Which was expected since it was one of \"the best.\" We sat at the bar and enjoyed the Flaca margaritas which were delicious and probably save this review from a 1 star. Two words: Overrated and Under-delivered. The table side guacamole was anything but spectacular. After a long wait for our food to arrive, we were not impressed. The tacos are miniature. After a mess up on our food and forgetting items on our plate, the waitress actually asked my mom to \"scrap off the fries from one plate to put them on her plate.\" Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets! Imagine driving thru Phoenix for your first time.  You head down 16th street and you find yourself in a distressed part of town. Or so it seemed. You come upon the building riddled with graffiti but very artsy looking stuff. Kinda looks like tattoos on walls. You walk inane it is packed (1pm) Friday afternoon packed. We knew we were going to have good food. The food was the best Mexican food ever. It wasn't typical Mexican food either. It had a lot of culinary flare to it. Very well prepared and presented. I am hoping to get back here again real soon and if your ever in Phoenix make your way here at any cost."}
{"text":"Went to Spring Training this year and was recommended this place by hotel staff. The restaurant is in a sketchy area so keep that in mind.   Best part of the meal was the guacamole dip. They make it in front of you and it tastes great. We asked the guy to make it the way he likes to eat it.   The place is very small and seats about 30. We went on a weekday night and it was still packed.   I can see why some people say the service is bad. Our guy didn't really converse, and was strictly business per se. I actually liked it in this case, because he was very efficient.   I'm going to try it again next year, and I might even up it to a 5/5."}
{"text":"The quality of food here is excellent!  The Horchata drink is soooo authentic (thicker/ richer than at other places)!  The menu is huge!  The prices may seem high at first, but the portions are very big.  We got a pork plate Cochinita Pibil for $19.75, which comes with lots of meat - the pork is so tender and so good.  On the side: tortilla wraps, their special mashed potatoes, and many zucchini slices.  We also ordered a Tacos Camaron, which comes with three of the same shrimp tacos, for $12.75.  The battered shrimp was fried just the right amount - it had just the right amount of crunch - so good.  The Horchata that we ordered was $5.50, which was Barrio's house made specialty - it came in a tall coca cola bottle that is enough for one refill.  It's a great dinner place - we will be proud to bring our out of town guests here.  Compared to our other favorite Mexican restaurant Gallo Blanco (on Clarendon), Barrio is more formal, does not have any happy hour on the weekend, seems to specialize in margaritas, and has a much bigger dinner menu."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that didn't have a bean and cheese burrito so I ordered the cheese enchilada which was $19.00. Yikes!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants in Central Phoenix.  I always recommend this place to people.  This is gourmet mexican cuisine at its best.  I have dreams about the Chile Relleno Costeno (Poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, scallops and queso)  - to DIE for, amazing."}
{"text":"I am very sad to say that I was disappointed with the food at Barrio Cafe. I ordered the carne asada tacos ($15.00 plate) and the meat was literally flavorless.   By the end of the meal, the bill for two plates of tacos and a couple of beers was just shy of $50.00. The best part of the whole meal was the bottled beer.   I was really hoping to like this place because I just moved down the street and was looking for a cool neighborhood spot to start hanging out. Besides the extremely high prices and the extremely terrible food, the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"What could I add to what has already been said of this weirdly located 16th and Thomas area restaurant?  On the way out, I went and thanked the bartender for mixing \"the perfect\" margarita.  I mean it was just their regular margarita, but it was spectacular.  This place is small.  This place has great art (sometimes a bad sign).  But, from the guacamole made table side...with pomegranate...(who woulda thunk it, right?) to each of the tasty desserts, the meal was a complete treat for our entire party of four.  If a Mexican place can't do enchiladas why would I trust any of the other dishes on this expansive menu.  The enchiladas were a delicious blend of scallops and shrimp, blue and white corn tortillas, cheesy goodness served with a side of grilled veggies.  The plate was licked clean.  Looking around at my guests' plates, they were equally impressed.  My wife had the poblano stuffed with chicken and walnuts and apricots and other deliciousness.  Now, for the desserts....think goat's milk caramel...stuffed in a churro.  Think of think crepes, again with the same caramel.  Now, a chocolate cake with the necessary hints of cinnamon and cayenne.  Yes, they have a traditional flan too, but it fell to forth place on this list.  The goat's milk caramel is as good a taste as I have had in a dessert.  Couple this with French pressed coffee at the table and the meal completes with aplomb.  Sure, the small nature of the place will scare some folks away.  No, I wouldn't do a business lunch or dinner here.  But, my wife and I will save nickels and dimes to come again.  It's not inexpensive, but it is worthwhile on value and ambiance."}
{"text":"First time at barrios was a hit! Only because I can't figure out how to do half a star. My hubby had the cochinita pibil which is pulled pork with achiote Tojo & sour orange with salsa. I had the halibut special cooked in white wine with olives, capers & tomatoes & grilled zucchini. The fish & meat were perfect! Service was efficient and friendly. Chill vibe and we loved the art work!!!!! Would go back tomorrow!!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here. Wasn't impressed $20 street enchiladas. And $13 street tacos. We ordered the guacamole it was more of an avocado salad. Won't be running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was hopeful walking into this place but left feeling so-so about it. I went with two other people and the plates were hit and miss. I feel that food prices must be commensurate with the atmosphere and it just didn't quite measure up."}
{"text":"Wow. Simply, wow. The food is sublime, the staff is attentive and fun the drinks perfect. Our food was a revelation of what Mexican cooking can be. The Chiles de Nogales is amazing. Was a beautiful mix of flavor. As a plus, the history and back story is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Over two years in Phoenix and my first dinner at Barrio still stands as my best meal since arrival.  Started with the house margarita, which was great.  Also have tried the Organic Margarita, and it is spectacular.  Decide how much you feel like spending and order accordingly, there is no wrong answer to this question.  Except maybe \"No thanks\".  I shared the Chiles en Nogada and the Pescado del Mar.  I can't pick a favorite, possibly due to the brain damage from the firestorm of joy transmitted from tongue to pleasure center.  Chiles en Nogada is a twist on the classic Chile Relleno, they start with a large fresh poblano pepper, stuff it with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, and I seem to recall pomegranate and angel dust, then top it with an absurdly tasty almond cream sauce.  Pescado del Mar is pan roasted halibut sort of stuffed/topped with crab, shrimp, lobster, and scallops, finished off with chorizo and another different, obnoxiously good cream sauce.  For dessert, absolutely get the churros.  Do remember the little cinnamon sticks that the word churro implies, but imagine them expertly prepared, stuffed with goats milk caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.  Service was friendly and efficient, the wait was long, but that was expected.  The Sunday brunch is also very much worth checking out, particularly for the seafood crepes.  My only disappointment from El Barrio so far was my own fault.  I didn't feel like waiting for a table and made the mistake of chosing Fish Tacos for a to-go order.  The shelf life on fish tacos is not long.  By the time I got home, we had a Captain Crunch enemy standoff going.  (Soggies...if you needed the clarification)"}
{"text":"Solid and delicious upscale Mexican cuisine.  We came here early, around 6pm on a Tuesday evening, and were able to get a table for 3 right away. The restaurant was a bit difficult to find, and the hostess was very friendly about vectoring me in by telephone. The enthusiastic and friendly server got drinks and house made chips on the table extremely quickly. Next up was the table-side guacamole; he custom prepared it from a cart containing pre-chopped and fresh avocado, tomato, onion, chiles, limes and cilantro. My teenage daughter declared it 'the best guac ever'!  I concur -- fab and custom. I agree with Mark C.'s review, and that the addition of the pomegranate seeds sends this dish to a new level!  I enjoyed one of the evening's specials: Halibut Vercruz style. Hailing from Seattle, I am extremely picky about my fish, and I usually never order it outside of my own burgh. However, since we have a deficiency of Mexican cuisine in Seattle, I ventured forth and was not disappointed. The halibut was ocean fresh and perfectly cooked -- just flaky to the fork. The Veracruz sauce it was bathed in blew me away: it was filled with piquant olives, capers and tomatoes and was redolent of garlicand chile. Fantastico. All of this fresh, flaky, flavorful deliciousness was generously portioned and placed atop Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, which were a perfect creamy canvas for the bold sauce. There was also some flavorful sauteed zucchini and onion.  My teenage companions rated the fish tacos as excellent and very fresh.  I did not get to taste them.  A fellow diner at another table commented that his filet mignon was excellent.  Barrio Cafe is a great dining experience. The chef creates dishes which are complex, interesting and layered.  The service was prompt, friendly and extremely efficient.   When we exited the restaurant after our meal, the restaurant was entirely full, with people waiting as well. Lucky them -- I can't wait to return to Phoenix and dine at Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"Had a thoughly good experience here on a Saturday night while in town.  Came for a late dinner and the place was pretty busy so we waited about 25 minutes for a table.  Ordered the tableside guacamole with pomegrante seeds which passed for above average.  However, the mole torta was superb as were the filled churros.  I understand it was a Saturday night, but for the price point I expected a bit more attention from our waitress."}
{"text":"Most incredible food I have ever had! Great flavors and incredible environment. This is unlike anything I've ever had, especially Mexican food. Truly a place where the food is elevated to level I never thought possible. I had the duck breast, ( yes I said duck breast) in a tamarind sauce. All I can say is that it was an experience I will never forget! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Mexico is a country.  A large varied country with many different cultures and styles of food.  Not unlike United States except your average Mexican has more in savings and less debt than the average US of A-er.  Going to Barrio to get a taco, chips, salsa, rice and beans is the equivalent of going to Des Moines, Iowa for seafood.  Order the tamarindo sauce or the red mole -- yes there is more than one kind of mole.  Order anything rubbed in Achiote. Have an amazing tequilla neat as your dessert as the uber knowledgeable staff can steer you in the right direction.  And the tacos for $1.50 at happy hour with a half price low rider will knock your socks off.  Truly is \"effin' good food\" as the t-shirts say.  Other idioms also apply."}
{"text":"Basically my favorite \"creative\" Mexican food spot. Hands down, best guacamole in town. Get it with everything in it - including the pomegranate seeds. The low rider margarita is awesome. Also, their signature pork dish is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"unimpressive.    cochinita torta, bland meat, onions weren't fully \"ready\"  needed to marinate in flavor for longer.   small portion of guacamole for 12$+ albeit very tasty.   plusses are that we had good service by the busboy. decent service by server, and food arrived on time.  minuses were the price.  Food super overpriced, like absurd prices.     12 bucks for a dessert, 12 bucks for guacamole, 7 bucks to add chicken on your salad that already costs 12$!  Main course was adequate in flavor. do not go here if you are expecting a romantic dinner eachother, you can barely hear anything its so loud."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment for lunch and were very impressed. The wait staff was very polite and quick despite being busy for lunch.  The chips and olive salsa were amazing.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer and it was awesome.  The pomegranate seeds on it was something we hadn't seen before but added a nice sweetness to it.  We split the Pablana sandwich at a friends recommendation. It was worth it.  First it's a big sandwich, the chicken is cooked perfectly.  Sautéed poblano peppers and red onions with there poblano sauce was amazing.  Then they add pine nuts which is a really nice touch.  Next time we are here we will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"It is hard to get in. It is a small place. Always busy. Recommend a reservation. It is a perennial favorite for many of the local papers. I love going there with an out of towner to impress them. I think the menu always changes somewhat."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. I don't quite know what to think. My husband I were passing through Phoenix and turned to Yelp for some suggestions on where to have lunch. The reviews suggested that this place was the bomb-diggity so we drove way out to the way out to get there. Walking in I noticed that all the patrons were Caucasian even though this is a Mexican restaurant in a heavily Latino part of town. I'm Whitey McWhiterson over here but even I know that's not a good sign. Overall, I felt the food was okay but not great and very Americanized. Pretentious service. Maybe I hit it on a bad day or maybe I just have different standards. Not sure what gives."}
{"text":"I have to totally disagree with Nicole T. I understand what she is saying about it not being a typical Mexican food joint. However, I don't think it claims to be. There are so many typical \"less than average\" Mexican joints in phoenix, I welcome some different Spanish flair. I had the Cochinita Panil tacos. They were absolutely out of control! My friend and I shared the Queso Fundido which was also terrific. The service was good and the selection of Tequila's is awesome.   So, while it is not another one of the thousands of Mexican joints in the valley, this one actually has something unique. I cant imagine anyone who has a clue about food at all not appreciating this place. Also, Zagat rates this place one of the top restaurants in the whole city."}
{"text":"Had a fun time with 3 friends on Friday night. Hostess said wait was 50 min, but we were at our table in 15. Not bad. Also I guess the bartender poured an extra glass of the Nebiola so she gave it to me for free.  Delicious. I usually don't like drinking red in the summer, but this was smooth and slightly jammy. Good move on her part because my friends enjoyed the wine so much we all ordered glasses ($11 a glass).   There was live entertainment with a guitarist which perked up the whole restaurant even more.   I didn't care so much for the bread they served. We started with appetizers: guacamole and queso fundido. Both were  excellent. The queso is a bit heavy and we only had a few bites each to make room for our entrees.  The conchinita pibil was excellent--tender slow-roasted pork with mash potatoes on the side. Large enough portion that I brought the leftovers home and it fed me and the roomie the next evening. YL had the enchilades de hongos which she enjoyed.   For dessert we shared the flan de mi mami. Nice."}
{"text":"I admit my expectations were pretty high based on the other reviews and word of mouth advertising on this place.  Based on that admittedly high expectation, I will say overall I was disappointed.  I went with a friend and we ordered the table side guacamole, Pollo Poblano and Pescado del Mar.  The guacamole was about average...nothing special (ours also had cranberries instead of the pomegranate seeds) .  The Pollo Poblano was definitely a better dish than the Pescado del Mar....tender chicken and a pretty good sauce.  The Pescado del Mar was the disappointing part of the meal.  The dish was served warm (not hot by any means) and the seafood was cooked inconsistently...the shrimp and lobster were fine, but the halibut and scallops were cooked unevenly (some parts were fine, while others seemed undercooked).  The potatoes served with both dishes were the best part of the meal.  We also had the specialty margarita of the day, which was very tasty, but we agreed it was slightly overpriced ($15).  Our server was exceptional and the staff in general was very friendly.  Will I go there again?   I might roll the dice and try another dish (like the Cochinita Pibil).  Overall, an OK experience that I thought was slightly overpriced ($110 dinner and a drink for 2, including the tip)."}
{"text":"A tasty (Mexican) food restaurant.  We've frequented Barrio several times since it's arrival in the area. I'm not positive but I could have sworn that they served beans in the past, as most all Mexican restaurants do, fancy or not.  Either way, I was craving them and sadly beans are no where to be found on the menu!  To me beans are a staple in our culture as they are in most cultures.  I doubt I'll be back to her restaurant after this disappointment.  Foundational simple things really do matter to us peasant folk."}
{"text":"Salud!!!  To the chef who brings you to her home the flavors of generations come shining through!!!!!  My third visit from New York and each time this is what is great about Phoenix....wish you would open your New York branch or at the very least share the recipe for the mole....don't miss El Bario Cafe a real treat"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere and awesome food.   Server gave us great suggestions... really opened my eyes to tequila. Loved the feel of the place and it was packed on a Tuesday night.  Food was timely but not rushed.   ALL in ALL a very good experience, you can tell this place is very well managed."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Food is above average but the prices are way too high. Small portions of food, small drink portions, and the service was just below average.   Almost all the times I've been here I've had to wait way too long to have my order taken, and they've almost always forgotten something at our table.  Again the food itself is above average but there is just so little of it, and the prices are way too high."}
{"text":"Don't like this place. It may be a different type of Mexican food, but they don't serve salsa with the chips, don't serve cheese crisps, the food that I did order was almost tasteless. When I walked in - smelled like a fish fry gone bad. Won't go back here if they paid me. Just don't like this type of Mexican food. Very different from Macayo's type of restaurants I understand."}
{"text":"This original location is in the neighborhood, but I'm also going to give a shout out to the airport location.  It has become our tradition to order up a mess of tacos with a side salad getting on or off the plane.  Who lounges about in an airport?  We do...just for Barrio Café!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We arrived at 6 PM and we're seated immediately. The service was quick and very professional. The food was brilliant. The avocado appetizer was perfect guacamole. Our entrees - chicken mole and a chicken tosta - were excellently prepared and presented. We each had a beer - there are good Mexican options - both priced reasonably. Easy to find, on 16th just off Thomas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  The food and ambience is spectacular."}
{"text":"Very good. Not the type of mexican food I grew up with...but a lighter more flavorful fare."}
{"text":"Love everything about this gem--the food, the service, the community art around it, the live entertainment. First visit today was brunch--for early for seats. Fish tacos were big pieces of halibut, lightly friend, lots of toppings, homemade tortillas. Messy to eat, but my plate was clean. One person had the open faced omelette and said it had perfect veggies, fresh cheese, and toast was soft and good. Seemed like lots of locals for brunch. I will be back for dinner next time in town, for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Barrio and my favorites are the avocado salsa with the pomegranate seeds and the churro with ice cream and caramel dessert.  I would not call this a guacamole it is more like an amazing chunky salsa.  The food is really filling so I always plan to share when I go and we will get a regular dish and an order of tacos.  I prefer the slow roasted pulled pork tacos but they are all good.  For me the downside is the environment it gets loud.  The tables are close and nothing absorbs the sound in the dining rooms.  I wouldn't recommend going for a serious meeting due to privacy and noise if busy."}
{"text":"Delicious . 2nd time here and never disappointed. Made it to happy hour for tacos and drinks"}
{"text":"tragic food and very high prices.  ciabatta is not the bread your supposed to use for a torta (you can go down the street to ranch market and get as many bolillos as you want)-gross-also cajun steak fries are not a garnish I want to eat at a mexican restaurant.  fundito should be creamy with good acidity and spice-you serve melted cheese goop with a few tired chiles inside and dry chorizo dust on the top.  Also-warm flour tortillas would be preferable to the tooth cracking chips you serve-those are not chip tortillas-those are enchilada tortillas.   cochinita pibil tacos-where was the marinade on the meat? no seasoning what so ever and dry dry dry-and french fries again?  I never got french fries in the yucatan?  so give me an ice tea and soda water and the bill was 46$ for lunch-i feel violated."}
{"text":"Gourmet and delicious but overpriced Mexican Cuisine. Fast service. Very friendly and proud staff. Maybe the high prices are to control customer flow since it is a small place. Due to the cost is good for a one time visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Hugo was such a great waiter, he suggested our drinks and dinner and we loved everything. Next time we come back to AZ we are coming here. Live music is great too! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing food and drinks."}
{"text":"WAYYYYYYY OVERPRICED for Phoenix. Food was good not great, except for the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.That was delish but very small and pricey. Drinks were tasty but small and pricey as well.The staff was okay, the ambiance was cool but didn't match the prices.This cafe is literally near the barrio but nobody in the barrio would be able to afford the prices and honestly could eat better food at home....Very disappointed!! If your into getting ripped off or your a hipster who doesn't mind pricey \"authentic\" mexican food, then this place is for you. Love visiting Phoenix but happy to be home in Los Angeles with affordable, delicious, authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"We came here one night based on a recommendation from our AirBnB hosts, who live down the street.  The food is amazing, the atmosphere is terrific, as is the service.  A standout was the bartender, who took extremely good care of us and everyone else who needed anything during the half hour wait for a table (totally worth it, by the way).  This is the food I grew up with, but cooked the way only the best home cooks can manage.  it's authentic and refined and completely delicious.  I look forward to more visits and working my way through the menu.  Also, weekend brunch here is on my Phoenix bucket list."}
{"text":"I found this place via google, and was very intrigued with the best Mexican awards.  I love the funky vibe with the street art and local artists featured inside.  The food is solid, but not knocking my socks off.  I imagine to be decorated that there would be multidimensional flavors and textures where every dish is presented well.    The evening started with the bread and olive tempande.  I like this spin that makes the restaurant unique.    We then ordered the table side guac.  Definitely fresh and delicious guac, but nothing that is so spectacular that I was amazed.  I did like the touch of pomegranate arils which provide a nice crunchy and juicy texture.    My friend had a house margarita which was pretty standard.  I had the chata beverage which is horchata mixed with tequila and kahlua.  It was tasty, but I didn't really feel any effects of the alcohol despite drinking it before eating.    For the main course, I ordered the filetito torta which was delicious and tender.  I got the salad on the side which was probably a mistake when the other option was fries.  It was just mixed green with balsamic vinegar based dressing with some white cheese and some chopped up peppers.  I enjoyed the torta, however.  I can't speak to my companion's fish tacos as I didn't try them, but it looked good but small.    The best part of the meal which actually lived up to the hype was the caramel churro dessert.  It was goat's milk caramel stuffed churro with more caramel on top with pecans and ice cream.  Very good.    This is a good Mexican restaurant, but the hype around it just builds you up to be disappointed.  It's also rather pricey for what you are getting and for the lack luster presentation/reputation/flavors."}
{"text":"First experience was outstanding.  Unique menu, excellent quality food.  Our second visit was good, just not as memorable as the first."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take people. My 'in the know' restaurant. Love the great food in a surprising location. :-)"}
{"text":"I miss Bario Cafe! This place is amazing and when they first opened you could always find amazing cactus dishes...yum. I have not seen cactus on the few times I get into town now but overall it is still some of the best Mexican food that is high end in town...and a spectacular atmosphere."}
{"text":"Interesting food, although their flag dish with pepper stuffed with walnut, Apple, etc is way too pricy even with pomegranate seeds and melted cheese. Looks to be a $24.00 half order. Saw the DDD show highlighting that dish. However actuality was like an olive and pimento on the plate. And no evidence of the Mexican flag. Plating was horrible.  Happy hour drinks good and my pulled pork main course was excellent.  The wife however was not pleased with her flag dish. Review is based on pricing too. Just because you got on TV doesn't mean you should charge celebrity prices for Bundy portions. Get real."}
{"text":"Wonderful modern Mexican food.  We had the guacamole with pomegranate seeds and it was amazing.  The pork was also incredible -- slow cooked so it literally melted off the bone and needed no knife.  Service was a little slow, but I think that's because the place was packed.  I am a patient person, so I didn't really mind.  The food was out of this world, so I can't imagine fussing about the wait staff!!  I would definitely go again and would bring more friends next time."}
{"text":"Wow!  The guacamole...  Graphic art meets Culinary art!  If you're in the mood for Mexican, this probably isn't the place because its not what we white folks think of  traditional at all.  However, if you are in the mood for an experience (both for food and ambience) this is your place!  Small and quaint with a large selection of Mexican beer and Tequila and great happy hour deals.  Don't forget to check out the bathrooms - seriously."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Phoenix for vacation and wanted to try this restaurant as we saw this on Triple-D. After seeing Guy almost melt when he tried every one of the dishes we couldn't wait to try the food.   The bread and salsa they started off with were ok. My husband loved the salsa but I wasn't a big fan.   We ordered the guacamole and thought it was kind of bland. It was missing salt and lime. The pomegranate seeds were good in there after we added more salt.   For our entrees we ordered Cochinita Pibil and the torta with Cochinita Pibil. We both thought that the flavor on the pork seemed washed out. The veggies and the mashed potatoes were good but took away from the authenticity of Mexican food. I was really looking for food similar to food on Mexico, not Americanized Mexican restaurants.   Something else that turned us off was that my husband asked for a spicy salsa and they brought over Tabasco.   For the price we paid the food was not as good as Guy made it look on TV."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I'd heard that Barrio had won awards and was a must-go place. My lady and I live close by so we decided to try it out. The wait was 45 minutes which was fine. We walked around and saw the artwork and the murals along 16th street and had a nice wait. When we were seated, we ordered drinks, the waiter mumbled a bit, and got them. This is the highlight of the meal. The beer was cold. After that, the waiter would meander by and mumble things like \"Yokay?\" and \"Howboutmore?\" before walking away, not waiting for a response. The food came, I had the Pollo Poblano, and I have never had a drier piece of chicken nor as flavorless a sauce. We get the check and...well, save yourself the money and buy a tank of gas to drive somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite restaurants, it's a such a jewel in our city! Strong vibe, creative menu, lots of great art and music! It's become a Phoenix staple!"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch with a couple friends.. Great food the cinnamon churros are delicious.."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I arrived and stood in the entryway, and was ignored by multiple staff (the restaurant was not busy at the time) walking past me without eye contact or greeting. Eventually, someone came up and sat me. I think seating customers must not have been the other workers' jobs, but the lack of eye contact and greeting from multiple workers was bad form.  I ordered the Chile en Nogada, touted as a chile stuffed with chicken, apple, pears, dried apricot, pecans, and surrounded by an almond cream sauce, some cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds. Sounds great, right? In reality, what I got was a seared pepper stuffed with dried-out mush. It was utterly disappointing. The chicken pieces and other filling was dried out, and did not have any dried apricots that I could discern. I did notice raisins. I also couldn't taste the apples or pears in the tasteless mush. The cream sauce was sickeningly sweet and did not combine well with the dried out mush that was stuffed inside the seared pepper. I could not finish even half of it. It was horrid.  A side plate that accompanied the Chile en Nogada / mush was potatoes, zucchini, and tomato. This tasted good, but in no way seemed congruous with the plate it accompanied. Very odd. But thankfully, something of the entrée was edible.  My friend ordered carne asado tacos. These tasted good (she gave me one as my meal was so bad). The side salad that accompanied them had a delightfully piquant dressing, but was marred by some rotten leaves of lettuce.  The olive tapenade and bread were odd starters at a Mexican restaurant. The bread was nice, but the tapenade was thoroughly boring. I ate one piece and had no interest in eating more.  My friend, who had the better meal, said she thought overall, it was terrible, and she would not be back.   I don't see much reason to go back. I think the kitchen was careless. Maybe the chiles en nogada is good if carefully prepared. We were there for dinner on a Sunday, so maybe the better chefs were not in the kitchen.  It's doubtful that I will be back. If in the area, I will try nearby Santissima.   The cramped bathroom (unisex) could use some refurbishment. It is very small and on entering, one about runs into a urinal. All the fixtures were quite old.  I mentioned to the waiter that I was quite disappointed in my meal. He did not say anything. It wasn't worth it to me to pursue it. I was not impressed with his lack of initiative. He also did not check on us to inquire how are meals were until we were done (and at that point, he did not inquire, I informed him).  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix, born and raised on the South-side under the shadow of South Mountain. My family comes from Cuidad Juarez, Estado de Chihuahua and I'm very proud to be Mexican-American. Barrio Café instantly appealed to me with its creative use of names in the menu and its new school approach to classic dishes.  However, this place's reputation is greater than what it can deliver. I had the carne asada tacos and they were average at best. My tortillas were dried out and cracked as I folded my taco. Too much time on the comal I suppose. Carne Asada should be flavorful, it should condense the taste of the beef into tender grilled pieces. This place's meat faded into the background of the cilantro and tomato that buried everything on my plate. The carne asada from my neighborhood carniceria out does this place for far cheaper.   The drinks were good at least and that is something. The Jamaica was tangy and brewed rich. That is something...  I also didn't appreciate the wait staff calling me a gabacho behind the bar, either. Nice. I'm light skinned not deaf, lads."}
{"text":"Busy but worth the wait for sure! Whatever the olive stuff is was bomb diggity! Will be returning again. If you live here, visit here, or just plain vacay here, this is the spot! Thanks triple D!"}
{"text":"The guacamole was excellent. The Pollo Poblano was very good. The second chicken breast was slightly over cooked."}
{"text":"This was an amazing local restaurant. The food was authentic and excellent. Very professional staff and upscale inside. Don't be intimidated by the looks of the building."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I made a resolution to cut back on eating out so much in 2018 and this was my first meal out since the beginning of the year, but more likely it's because the flavors were outstanding and the ambiance was fun -- whatever the reason, I am a big fan.  We picked this spot because we had some out of town guests that wanted some authentic Mexican food.  As I was trying to decide where to go, my boyfriend said - it doesn't really matter where we go, food will all be the same.  At the end of the evening, he agreed that that he was wrong.        This not your typical Mexican restaurant.  They have many of the 'typical' Mexican dishes on the menu - tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, but the composition and flavor combinations are not typical.  Instead of chips and salsa, they brought bread and olive tapenade.  Instead of mexican rice and beans, our dishes came with side of roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes.          We went on a Saturday night with a party of 5 at 7pm.  There was a 30-45 minute wait.  We drank and had appetizers at the bar so it went by quickly.  The service was top notch and the live music created a fun atmosphere.  The music is loud, so maybe not the most ideal spot if you're trying to have an intimate conversation.  Entrees between $16-$30."}
{"text":"didn't quite live up to the hype but definitely not a bad place to go. I had the pollo en mole and it was great. the organica margarita was very fresh tasting. my sister however had the Rojas enchiladas and was disappointed. it tasted dry and the cheese had hardened. service was decent. overall the ambience was lively and the food was a above average. I gave it 3 stars but would give it a 3.5 if possible."}
{"text":"Went here last night with some foodie friends based on other reviews and their previous lunch experience.  For us out in The QC, it's a bit of a hike for dinner, but for me the food was well worth it.  We arrived at around 6:45pm on a Friday night and had about a less than 10 minute wait (4 of us).  We sat and listened to the live music for the night by Gustavo Angeles.  Pretty great guitar player.  I friggin love latino music and so the vibes were awesome for me.  Food - was great.  I had the Chile Relleno and also got a side of a slow-roasted pork taco (had to try it).  The Relleno was fantastic for me.  Not battered like others, but full of flavor and I really liked it.  Wife had the Mole which I thought was good (rich, but good...but all Mole is).  We had guacamole made at our table...pretty basic, but addition of 'craisins' were actually a good touch.    Dessert was amazing.  Goat's milk caramel stuffed churros...are you kidding me?!?!!? Wow, they were good.  As we were sitting the table next to us got served Tortas...I always expect Tortas not to be enough for dinner, but don't write them off here...LARGE.  If I go back, I'll have one of those.  Perhaps the only two things my wife and I walked away from with a thought was the price.  For us non-drinkers, our bill was $75.  The Yelp rating of $11-30 doesn't give a good range.  If you aren't getting Tortas or Tacos, expect $20/person + drinks and appetizer and dessert costs.  The other: a bit loud...expected in a smaller area though...wasn't bad, just noticeably louder than most places.  We love the experience though and time with friends is great!  Recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Service was horrible by Cesar incredibly rude just blew us off.  However the food was great.  Yes we'll come back just not the same server please"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Ambience is okay. some interesting art work on the walls and outside. Not a big fan of most of the art work. Lots of choices and the waiter was very informative.But he must have just gotten off of his other job as a car salesman. This guy was slick willy. Trying to steer us to the highest price items on the menu. The food was excellent though. Everybody enjoyed their food.  The waiter decided to charge us a 20 percent gratuity even though we had three adults two little kids and a baby. we only ordered 4 entree's.  It's too bad there so gung ho about jacking you for max money there. It's not a bad place otherwise."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday. I haven't been in a couple of years and I remember there pico was the best. Now it's different. Kinda bummed out actually. Friendly staff is a plus and great drinks. The food is alright. They happy hour is half off there drinks so will definitely be back for that"}
{"text":"So this may have well Been the tastiest Mexican food I have ever had. I had the cochinita pibil. The pork it's self was so succulent it just broke apart and topped with the pickled red onion just added a different dimension to the dish. Served with mashed papas which I could probably have eaten a plate full of them on their own were just delicious. All elements combined on the plate so well together.   I've read other reviews saying it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for,  great service and most importantly GREAT FOOD!  This is one not to be missed"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with this place.  My boyfriend and I frequent here as often as we can.  The service is always great as well.  This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We had a large party (9) and knew it was a smaller place so we got there at 5:15 on a weekday.  We were told it would be an hour and that didn't seem unreasonable and since it was a nice day we sat out on the small patio and enjoyed some drinks and conversation.  Our table was ready and our expectations high.  Service was not fast but our waitress was friendly enough.  We ordered a double order of the famous guac and lets just say it was ok.  If you like super chunky avocado \"dip\" with pomegranate seeds this is for you.  It was interesting but to be honest we were so hungry after 90 minutes we all chowed down.  We ordered entrees and waited another 30-40 mins.  Now we were ready for some of this highly touted award winning chef food.  Let's just say we were all pretty much let down.  Food was not flavorful and didn't even seem all that fresh.  I've had better Mexican in the Midwest.  The menu was interesting and I'm hoping we just caught a bad night but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and the food is really good but I think it's too expensive for being Mexican food....okay contemporary Mexican food. Name it what you want but I think it's a good $8 caliber food that I paid $15 for. The service has always been good but you better get there early or you will wait and they don't have much room for you to wait in so you will be outside.   The one thing you do have to try when you get there is the churro in ice cream dessert. That is always the highlight when I go. If you take friends or family I really don't think they will be disappointed but your wallet will."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was impressed.  First of all, parking was super easy.  There was no wait, which is great when a popular restaurant does not take reservations.  They also have a full bar, which is not a requirement, but definitely preferred, and the food was fantastic.  They make a great guacamole with pomegranate.  I had the tacos carne asada which were  fresh and tasty.  I will return for sure."}
{"text":"The food was kinda meh to me. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? Came in for Sunday brunch and ordered off their Sunday menu. I had the chilaquiles mole and it tasted quite bland. The tortillas were extremely dry. Would avoid that dish if you were planning on picking it.  The service here, although nice and friendly, was extremely slow. When I got there, there was no line, yet somehow the tables inside were still not cleaned so I had to wait. After waiting several mins, one of the guys just gave up and walked me to a large table (way bigger than what was necessary, but all the small tables still had dirty plates on them). For a first impression, we're already off to a bad start. Coincidentally, my last impression was also one of slow service. I couldn't get my servers attention for the life of me. She was the only one working the entire back room it seemed like. All I wanted was to get my check to leave. After sitting there for a good 10 mins just trying to flag her down, she finally came to my table to see how I was doing. After telling her I wanted the check, another 10 mins pass by (she forgot, apparently) yet still no check. Again, I had to try and flag her down and ask for the check. I finally get the check after what seemed like 30 mins of just trying to pay and leave."}
{"text":"My new favorite. Although, I think the food is overpriced and the long lines unbearable. Despite the hype around this restaurant, I think the food and experience deserve the kudos.   My yelp \"tag line\" is Erika \"waits in no line\" Keenan. I hate waiting in line. And I don't wait in line. I pride myself in being a person that doesn't get sucked into hype. I guess that's why it took me so long to try the Barrio Cafe.  Don't make the same mistake.   Parenthesis to my review and to help add a little background:  My mother is from Central Mexico (Born in Leon, Juanajuato and raised in Mexico City). She even owned her own Mexican restaurant in upstate New York. This food reminds me very much of what I grew up with -- but adds a twist (I hesitate to call it gourmet-ish) that is what must create the buzz.   The location is not sexy -- which is another reason why I loved the experience. (Not the best reason to choose a restaurant, but one that always adds extra appeal to my decision making process :) The space is small, but I didn't feel confined. The service was not rushed - but everything came out timely.   Richard, the host, informed us that we would have an hour wait.  But it really only took 35 minutes (still a lifetime to someone who doesn't like to wait in lines).    But, I was celebrating my birthday with friends, so I think I was distracted and maybe a little more forgiving.  My party started with the guacamole. They add pomegranates - which I guess is the \"gourmet\" twist.  Back East, avocados may be more expensive, but out here, no.  Not sure where the $10 price tag comes from - maybe those damn pomegranates.  A nice add - but not necessary.   Since the guac is made fresh at the table, you can always ask to omit the pomagranates, or any of the additional incredients for that matter, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't reduce the cost.  For the main course, I enjoyed the Enchiladas Suizas and my friend enjoyed the Enchiladas de Mole. Both were incredible and I'm confident my mother would approved of the mole. My friend and I both agreed we loved the Enchiladas Suizas best though. (By the way, we had to take part of our meals home and, for the record, the reheated well when we had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.)   I do think the food is a pricey (especially considering what I remember my mother charging in New York for the same dishes -- well ok -- she never served pomegranates in the guacamole).   But, overall I honestly think this is a great place - and I'm so proud Phoenix has someplace that actually services central Mexican food (there's more to Mexico than a double flour tortilla with cheese in the middle or a burrito).   For another Mexican restaurant - without the hype, the gourmet twist, or the price tag, try Tortas la Presa on 24th St."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in the area. Our group of 5 ate here on a Sunday evening expecting a great meal and service. We were put at a corner table for 4, after waiting longer than we'd been told. The noise was so bad we could not converse, the server was rude and the food  ok- nothing exceptional..... None of us will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday with my Daddy.  The location is sketchy to say the least, but once you get inside it's nice.  The menu was big but kind of expensive. Pretty shitty they don't have a lunch menu either. My Dad wasn't very hungry so he got the Posole Verde (pork & veggie soup). I got the Tacos de Carne Asada (pretty self explanitory). Dad said soup was tasty & I felt the same way about my tacos. The meat had to be the best part, so tender. The fries it came with, eh I've had better. Wish I got the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (churros & ice cream dessert) but for $12, wtf!?  Overall this place has very good food but a little too pricey, especially for the location. I think our total was about $30-for a a bowl of soup, 4 tiny tacos + fries & 2 drinks. Don't think we will be in any hurry to come back..."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this restaurant since I moved to Phoenix over 5 years ago.  It has great reviews, the chef is often featured in local magazines, lots of people love it, etc.  I just never made it because my all-time favorite restaurant in town is also on 16th street (La Condesa aka La Santisima). On a number of occasions I've planned to go to Barrio but once I'm on 16th Street I just go to La Santisima because I love that place.  Anyway, today I finally went to Barrio, and will never make this mistake again.    First, the food was mediocre, at best. I will admit that their guacamole was delicious. But that's about it.  I literally didn't eat my plate.  That's how bad it was.  Second, everything was over-priced.  I have no problem paying higher price for good food, but this just isn't worth it.  For example, that delicious guacamole is $13. The fries that came with the tacos tasted like cheap grocery store frozen pre-cut fries, which is gross.  The corn tortillas that the tacos came in were terrible--mealy and dry, and the salsas (2 kinds) just tasted like vinegar--no complex flavors or spice.  Third, and most upsetting, the service was horrendous.  It was possible one of the worst service experiences I've had in a restaurant in town.    So I'm glad I tried it, because now I will never wonder about heading here when I'm craving Mexican food, and will definitely never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Cute place. Seems like its made for date. Live music during the night i was there. The food was amzing. The guacamole is to die for. Must try"}
{"text":"Had the Torta Filetito... WOW!  A large Torta that's very filling and very good with a little spice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is just ok in my opinion. I've had lots of authentic Mexican food at a more reasonable price. This was expensive for the quality of the food. Also our waiter wasn't the best he didn't have a great attitude kinda just the \"I'm here be I have to be here attitude\" and he forgot our drinks and we waited forever finally just caught him waking by and asked for the check. We won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Heard so much about Barrio Cafe and finally tried it for my birthday. I did enjoy the guacamole. The margarita was also very good until the bill came- I never would have gotten a second drink at nearly $14 each! The waitor said it was their \"special\" today.  Although tasty, the drink was small and did not have much tequila. We both ordered from the Tortas menu and neither of us were happy with our choice-very bland. I know that  they advertise that they don't do hot and spicy food, but we did expect flavor. Over priced and over rated. We won't return."}
{"text":"First timer. Started off with slow service but seemed to pick up after I made a little joke to the waiter. Ordered the signature margarita which was very good, guacamole made table side, and pork tacos. Great tasting food but a bit pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"VERY ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT!!!!! THEY HATE THE POLICE  Witnessed them actively disrespect local Phoenix Police Officers while they were investigating something.

{"text":"Tequila and guacamole. Start off with a good tequila and be prepared to wait. On a weekend night you'll find yourself waiting for a while, but the food is worth the 45 minutes.  Guacamole is an event and they make it right at your table with pomegranates. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Just put a review up on my page. Would've given 5 stars but our server was a little slow on getting our check,  twice and and was a kind of all over the place.

{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few weeks ago.  The food was phenomenal.  The seafood was fresh and delicious.  The margaritas were not very good at all (despite the excellent large selection of tequilas) but I could care less because the food was that good!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Great atmosphere. Ordered the most expensive Margarita withe casa noble anejo  and gran Marnier. Needless to say it was awful. The color if it alone was,a tell tale sign. It should have been very gold and it wasn't. I ordered a grilled fish taco, but received a fried taco. It was very very small and mostly  breading. Also impossible to eat with your hands or a fork and knife. My bf ordered a Carne Asada  torta. The meat was tender, but bland. The best part of everything ordered was the fries which were just ok."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Second time here, dinner was amazing.  Happy hour is deliscious!!  $1.50 your choice of 7  different tacos!!  Highly recommend halibut, shrimp, pork and carne asada were our favorites in that order.  Organic Margaritas are the best!!  Half off all drinks, best tequila selection!!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that I really WANTED to like Barrio Cafe and will return in the hopes that our visit was a really off night.  However, my first visit was hugely disappointing. Service was fair-to-good.  The music was great, even if misplaced. The food was a major let-down.  As others have noted, our dinner started with a bread and a sort of Mexican-inspired tapanade. It was a nice alternative to chips and salsa.  For dinner we split an order of Tacos de Tinga and then she had the Torta de Mole and I had the Cochinita Pibil. As we understand it (based on a combined 27 years of living in Mexico), tinga is usually a chicken dish cooked with either chipotles or chorizo and a LOT of onion. The sauce is created as a result of the cooking and is usually a nice mix of spicy and sweet (the sweetness coming from the onion). At Barrio Cafe, our experience was with what appeared to be chicken breast that was cooked on the grill or in a pan and then tossed in a sort of sweet sauce with no hint of either chorizo or chipotle and it was completely missing the sweet reduced onion flavor. Further, the tacos were served with a salsa that did not complement the meat at all.  My Cochinita Pibil was completely underwhelming. The achiote used was not nearly strong enough, and the meat was overcooked. Thankfully it was half-price for the restaurant's anniversary. Perhaps the full-price version actually tastes like Cochinita Pibil. It should also be noted that the pickled red-onion was lacking flavor and the puree (of potato?) was difficult to identify.  My wife's dish was equally strange. The Torta de Mole started off promising. The actual mole sauce had a nice taste to it. Unfortunately, the chicken had been cooked without the sauce (that's twice, see a trend here?) and did not have any flavor of its own. The bread the torta was served on was probably the best part of the meal. The fries (fries with a torta? OKAY) were seasoned with something we couldn't put our finger on and accompanied by a lazy ketchup that had something, maybe chipotle or achiote?  We skipped dessert. For our money, we'd rather get tacos at La Condessa or La Frontera (both on the same street)."}
{"text":"If only zero stars was possible.  After having my nephew for an appointment at Children's Hospital, we thought we would try Barrio for lunch.  We arrived at 10:55 to find that they were not open (according to the door they open at 11).  The doors were open as repairmen were walking in and out.  We stood in the parking lot until 11 at which time my sister walked in to see if we could be seated.  She was promptly escorted back out the door having been told they were not open yet.  After 5 more minutes of standing in the parking lot we decided to leave.  I walked in to tell them that they had lost our business.  The staff's only response?  \"Well, if you care to wait we'll be open in a few minutes\".  Incredibly poor customer service.  You never, EVER leave customers standing outside.  Is the food good?  We'll never know as I certainly won't try them again.  My suggestion?  Head around the corner to Juan's instead (we did!).  Not only do they open at 10, the family that run it is very nice and the food was fantastic...and CHEAP!  Skip the Barrio hype.  WAY too many other great places to eat in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Don't understand the hype.  The only thing worthwhile were the half priced Margaritas."}
{"text":"I ate here last week with my boss (she picked).  We had heard that this was a \"must try\" restaurant and had received great reviews.  I have to say that it was good, but I have had better.  I felt the prices were extremely high for Mexican food.  They did tableside guacamole, which was I think $12 or something.  The place was really small, which I actually liked because it felt homey and relaxed.  All in all, it was ok."}
{"text":"I try to go here at least twice a month for their Taco Tuesdays!  The margaritas are only $5.00 but they have an extensive TEQUILA menu which is fabulous.  The choice of $2.00 tacos, while small, are flavorful and creative!  It gets busy so go early on a Tuesday and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Completely deserving of the great reviews this place consistently garners.  I met a couple of friends here not long ago. I had heard many great things about Barrio , but had never made it in. Obviously I had only seen pictures because I had no idea what it looked like on the outside. Being somewhat unfamiliar with the area, I accidentally passed it three times. After my third U-turn, I finally spotted it.  Limited parking turns out to be in the rear. Same place where the pain was at trying to find this place for the first time.  The interior is very interesting. There is alot of Dios De La Mujer going on which is very colorful images of dancing skeletons etc.  The place was packed, although I was told that they were having a somewhat slower than normal evening. I sat in the front with my friends who were halfway through their cervezas. I was so hungry by this time I barely greeted them and started instead to greet the delicious ships and varied salsa in between us. Our server was there immediately with an offer for my beverage selection. Yes, I replied.  We began with one of the specialties: The Guacamole Casero which was prepared table side using obviously the freshest of ingredients. The server explained that, when in season, fresh pomegranate is added for texture and sweetness. Today however, dried cranberries were used. Wonderful addition to the classic recipe.  One of my friends ordered the Pato en Tamarindo (Seared Duck) and was very pleased. I forgot what the other friend ordered. Did I mention Cervezas? I chose the highly recommended Cochinita Pibil (12 hour slow roasted pork with achiote rojo & sour orange). It was incredible. I asked to sample the mole and found it's smokey dark chocolate flavor also complimented the meal.  It turns out that the manager is an old friend of mine and we caught up on more than 20 years. For a list of who's moved, died or whatever, just ask the manager. He sent over a trio of high end tequila shots for us to sample along with another house favorite: freshly baked Churro with warm, sweet caramel resting on a mound of creamy vanilla bean ice cream. It was the perfect finish for a great dinner!  Service, ambiance, and the food deserve 5 stars all around. Getting there for the first time- uh, not so much-but worth it in every way!"}
{"text":"I don't know how people think this is so great especially given the cost vs what you get. The flavors were nothing special, it's not like they've imported some rare extinct spices,meats or found some \"magical technique\" to make simple enchiladas. Do they use cheese made in the back using milk from rare goats or cook in zero gravity?   I'm sorry, I can't justify fighting parking, the wait times and the prices for what is in the end basic Mexican food."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here!  Wish I had the money and time to go here more often.    Must order items from what I've tried so far:   Guacamole with pomagranate seeds Chiles en Nogada Cochinita pibil pork Enchiladas del mar Fish tacos churros rellenos (dessert)  OMG, I'm hungry just typing this."}
{"text":"delicious-my go to spot for friends and out of town visitors-i don't even look at the menu. we just ask for the servers recommendations and go for it!!-- i read the other less than good reviews and i have never experienced anything other than delicious food, great service. i typically go during the week for dinner when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Our second time at the Barrio Cafe. Great food. Wildly busy for a week night; they handled the flow.  Note: they do not take reservations except for special big parties. The bartender is a pro. The food is way above the offerings of most \"Mexican\" restaurants. That makes me happy."}
{"text":"Brought visitors here for lunch. Food was fine but service was mediocre. Asked waiter for water twice and each time he said, \"Yeah, sure\" but didn't bring it. Finally got water more than half way into the meal by flagging down a bus boy. Basics, like water, shouldn't be an issue."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic brunch with my girls! The food was delicious as were the margaritas. The guacamole with pomegranate was unexpected but delicious! Great atmosphere! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is off the charts.  Not your standard Mexican fare, but I loved every dish. If you are tired of the usual Mexican food, you gotta give this place a try.  Interesting location, with a very friendly staff. We started with the guacamole - first time we had pomegranates in it. Fantastic. The homemade sangria is amazing. 4 of us each had a different entree, & it is obvious you can't go wrong with anything you order. Save room for the flan - one of the best ever. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food and service experienced on 9/2. Extremely understaffed for a Saturday night- took 30 minutes to get our order taken and then another 40 to get our food. Warning: if you like good chips and tacos this is NOT the place. Chips and tortillas are overcooked and stiff making it difficult to chew. Simply, yuck! Table side made guacamole was lumpy, tasteless, and unappetizing. Will definitely not be back unfortunately"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food restaurant. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and experience! We showed up around 5:30 with a party of 8 and were told the wait would be an hour, which was pretty much right on.  Server was quick, friendly and open with his recommendations.  Only a few in our party ordered cocktails (margaritas) and the were very tasty. The iced tea was good, too. Food was excellent; our party tried many different items and everyone was pleased. Start with the guacamole, it's prepared table side; a unique and delicious recipe. As an entree I had the cochinitas pibil and it was very good. The pork was tender and juicy and the sauce gave it just a bit of kick. Dessert was yummy, too; we tried the churros and chocolate cake...churros were the winner, hands down.  They did add an auto-gratuity at the end, which drives me crazy at a nice restaurant for a large, adult party. We always tip, usually better than the auto-gratuity; I resent the implication that we wouldn't or wouldn't tip as well, but maybe I'm just sensitive."}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere but it is highly priced so be ready to pay"}
{"text":"Overpriced imitation Mexican food. If you like classic Mexican dishes with a trendy urban spin that no longer makes it Mexican this is your place. I ordered an elote and got a bowl of soup and was told it was a deconstructed elote . If you want yuppie NON authentic Mexican this is your place. If you want simple Mexican food try the many places around this dump."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Mexican food.  Drinks are even better.   Especially at happy hour when they are half price.   Parking is a real challenge.  But the food is worth the hunt for a parking spot.  Take a small car.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum is all I can say! We drove right by it twice before we realized where it was but don't be discouraged based upon the exterior! The rave reviews of food network and guide books do it justice. The service was excellent! Speedy quick! My drinks were constantly being refilled, my plate was swooped away within a minute of finishing. Our waiter warned us that many people are caught of guard by the mole sauce. He recommended we try it before ordering. He brought us some out and glad he did, mole isn't for everyone. With that new knowledge we all order tacos. Carne asada and fish. They were three street style  tacos. Very very good. Fresh avocado on top makes me want to put it on everything! Overall, a great experience and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING.  I had reservations for New Years Eve.  Got right in right on time.....excellent service from our waiter, our water glasses constantly filled.....amazing menu, excellent recommendations.  The service was absolutely STELLAR. The food....WOW!  Fresh, delicious and prepared with obvious passion.  This was my best dining experience since I've been in AZ.  Such a refreshing and delicious breath of fresh air in a sea of chain restaurant after chain restaurant that makes up 99% of the restaurant choices in Phoenix.  I cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The first meal I had at Barrio was my best friends birthday. She ordered tacos I ordered the Barrio pollo burrito. The burrito was so large and yummy I took half home the next day. I shared my burrito with a friend for breakfast and it was just as amazing the next day as it was that evening. It is in the flavor is in the chicken sauce and pinion. When I return I almost always order that however I have tried other things including the table side guacamole with pomegranate. It is to die for and I have tried to replicate it at home however never exactly the same. If you take friends they will be impressed at the tableside guacamole."}
{"text":"I was not terribly impressed with the place, to be honest. I'd read good reviews so maybe I was expected too much. I did NOT like the bread and olive salsa and was terribly disappointed not to have chips and salsa, since this is one of my favorite things about Mexican type eating out. I hate olives. The shrimp tacos were OK. I ordered a margarita and was not too wild about it. It was strong, which I guess is nice, but it was not very tasty and there was a LOT of ice involved. With so many other options for Mexican food, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my oh my!  Area looks sketchy but the food is first class!  Great beers but food service was tops!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a local but found it lacking. Was there at 2 pm and appreciated that it was an early happy hour; otherwise drinks average about $12. Dishes most all in the $20 range which is expensive for a late lunch. Tried the chicken stuffed poblano but chicken pieces were overcooked."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The flavors and combinations that Chef Silvana puts together are unique and really tasty.  Our favorite waiter is Hugo so ask to sit at his table.  Be prepared to wait and know that it is completely worth it.  If you need to use the restroom just be prepared for a unique experience.  To describe it here would take away from the experience.  Again the food is the best gourmet Mexican I. Town and the tequila selection is incredible.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"When you first drive up not sure if you are in the right place and once you walk in its great ambiance and definitely great food."}
{"text":"took the BF for lunch and he insisted on doing the review....  Ok so first time at this beautiful looking place very traditional look. First thing first ... No hot sauces...no beans... No tortillas....I was served an italian loaf in stead of tortilla chips...fries which is American with my tacos....and I could of made more traditional guacamole at home.... Sorry barrios cafe. You are not a \"best in phoenix Mexican restaurant\""}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, authentic food that combines many different flavors and spices. The staff was very welcoming and efficient. Although the area around it might seem rough, don't pass this up. Highly recommend the agua de horchata, the carnes asada tacos and the churros! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Long wait but worth it. Live music. The food is sooo good. The guacamole dip is amazing !! They make it in front of you, and I tried to memorize what the waitress was doing so I could do it myself at home...but it didn't turn out the same."}
{"text":"I took my family here when they were in town last month, and we all loved it.  The ambiance was festive and homey.  The meals looked enticing when they were served, and they lived up to expectations.  I ordered the mushroom and cheese enchiladas.  The truffle sauce was heavenly.  It was an extremely rich dish, and I loved every second of eating it.    When you're trying to think of places to take out of town guests, particularly ones who are expecting good Mexican food because, hey, Arizona is close to Mexico, take them to Barrio."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmostphere. What more can you ask? Equally good for a romantic dinner or a business meal."}
{"text":"This place is crowded! The need for a bigger space is definitely in need. I had ppl hovering over me trying to order their drinks at the bar while I tried to have dinner. Not necessarily the restaurants fault.  Tacos were small, heavily priced but good--  I'm not sure that it lived up to the hype. I thought the Beer selection was great - Margaritas tasted great."}
{"text":"Way over rated. The food is expensive, portions are small  and not well prepared. You can do much better by going  to almost any hole in the wall Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant to bring visitors from out of town. The food is always delicious and the tequila selection is out-of-this-world. Barrio is almost always packed, so be prepared to wait outside for awhile before you can get a table. My advice: order a sangria or a margarita and take it out on the patio while you wait. Once you get seated, make sure you order an appetizer. This place is famous for its guacamole, but I prefer the quesadilla de langosta borracha. Those little lobster quesadillas are messy and absolutely decadent!   For dinner, I love the enchiladas de mole, which are enchiladas smothered in a smoky, chocolate-based sauce (mole). The pato en tamarindo (duck with tamarind sauce) and the cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork) are also amazing. My other favorite is chiles en nogada, which is a poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, spices and all sorts of fruits. It's truly unusual (in a good way), but unfortunately Barrio only offers it for part of the year (I believe it's available from Septemeber until February maybe?) Don't be afraid to try something new. I've taken lots of people to Barrio and they have all been blown away by the food."}
{"text":"This place serves yummy food.  The mole sauce is delicious, and I love the pomegranates added to the guacamole, as well as the large, thick and crispy chips that accompany it.    The waiters are helpful in selecting one of their many tequilas to sip.  Or, you can always have a refreshing margarita.    Want the Pollo en Mole but don't want to pay $19?  Order the Torta de Mole Negro.  It's the same thing but served as a sandwich with fries and a delicious chipotle-kissed ketchup or a small salad.  I really like the atmosphere here--unpretentious yet hip.  There is always interesting art work on the walls, and the music is generally good.  Yay for supporting locally-owned, non-chain restaurants serving authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"first time here and I was VERY disappointed. what authentic Mexican restaurant doesn't serve chips and salsa? Ice chips cold olive dip with bread! Service was bad, server seemed rude to his own race but catered to the Anglos. We ordered a micheleda and it was so salty and horrible , very small portions for the way overpriced food. No Thanks to this place. There are better places in the hood that are authentic!"}
{"text":"NOPE. not so much.   I LOVE mexican food. And as soon as I saw modern mexican food on the sign (cause it wasn't really in anyones reviews) I paused....the majority of the time, modern mexican food means bland and annoyingly different. BUT I was already there and I had dinner plans. I got two 'La Margarita' which is there 8 dollar house margarita, these were pretty good so we started off well. I like the bread and spread that they offered on the table (you need a filler while you wait for your food). Not sure I would classify that mexican at all (just because you have olivas doesn't make it mexican, and in all truth it was more like tapas) but I liked it. The waiter was pretty attentive in the beginning so that was appreciated. We ordered our food with a couple suggestions.   I originally was going for la torta de pollo y jaiba, but honestly i don't want to pay $15 to each a sandwich. Soooooo, I quickly picked an oldie but a goodie (maybe that was my mistake) the tacos de carne asada. My friend ordered some spicy sweet chicken tacos (i'm not sure exactly about the name). Our food really did take quite a while to come out, but when you have good company sometimes thats ok. They did get me a second drink during that time, once again thanks :).   When i got my food, i was really surprised that they served me french fries.... 15 bucks for a plate and i got french fries (MODERN?) Ok no big deal, i asked for some mayonesa or hollandaise sauce, thats when the service went down. I was done with 3 tacos and all my fries by the time he walked by us and I had to ask for it again... He never checked to see if everything was going well. I think thats a must and i just started to feel irritated with him at that point   And then there were 4 tacos. Small tacos, corn tortillas, with cilantro and onion. BLAND, just fucking BLAND. I couldn't believe it. I had sadly previously read a review of this restaurant that said the same thing! QUE TONTA FUI YO. I felt so stupid. I ate them....but what the F***. How are you going to make carne asada with NO flavor. My company never commented on liking their dish or not, only at the end to say it was very spicy.   I might go back and try something else, maybe something more 'modern'. BUT it will most likely be if someone else is paying. I could have gotten a better plate of the same thing from a hole in the wall mexican restaurant for $4 dollars.   No Thanks"}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant will be in my \"little black book\" for the best that Phoenix has to offer.  Delicious food - a varied menu that would satisfy any epicurious diner!  Our group had everything from steak, chicken, fish and veggie entrees.  No complaints - we all left happy (and full!).  Small intimate dining room with plenty of charm and wonderful wait staff.  This one is a keeper."}
{"text":"taken directly from my blog -- one of the new things I am doing this year is, I want to pick out really cool interesting places to eat when we travel. This time I picked Barrio Cafe in Phoenix because I had read great things about it and seen it featured on the TV. Let me just say, Wow!  My publisher was speechless from how good the food was. I was so happy, because being the only female on the team, means, I only get one chance to make a good impression, if they hate it, that's it my vote is revoked forever! lol. I ordered Chile Nogada, Chef Sylvana's signature dish. AMAZING! My boss had the cochinito poblano, I tasted that dish as well, my God, I had no idea meat could actually melt in your mouth! If you love great food, this is the place to try!!!"}
{"text":"Sylvana knows her stuff and is the #1 Mexican food place in the State.  Not much more than I can add that hasn't already been said.  Everyone that we've taken here has raved about the quality.  Be sure to get in early, and don't be surprised if you have a wait.  It's worth it.  Be sure to check out both of the unisex bathrooms.  It's a hoot!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Sangria is the beat house made sangria I've had in a long time. Desert was also really good.  So many tequilas to choose from but no list."}
{"text":"This food is awesome. So much flavor and depth to their dishes. Start with the guacamole. It so good and fresh. They add pomegranate seeds which give it a cool taste. Very unique and delicious ! All the food was fantastic and we wanted to try everything ! The margaritas were also so good and made with freshly squeezed juice.  Way beyond a Mexican restaurant this is Mexican fine dining. 5 stars !"}
{"text":"yum.  very good food. Not cheap so don't come expecting cheap Mexican food. The flavors were incredible on everything we had.  I wish they had a lunch menu, but other than that fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for so long, especially after I read a \"Best of Phoenix\" review in Phoenix magazine.   I get so SOOOOO tired of americanized \"mexican\" crap. I am up to my ears in cheap enchiladas, bad ground beef tacos and a weak tequila menu.   I love the authenticity of the cuisine offered by this cute little restaurant. It is authentic and unique, because there is a wide variety of regional flavors incorporated into various dishes on the menu. I, being the carniverous hog that I am, chose the Torta de Filetito...hey steak and chorizo with bread?! I am so there...and it was comida chingona. :) Filet, Roquefort cheese and spicy chorizo on toasted crusty bread...The boy had Pollo con Mole Negro. It was my first experience tasting Mole, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and the tasty mashed potatoes and squash that cam with the chicken.   I can't wait to go back and try the Tamarind Glazed Duck Salad.   I was a little disappointed that our service was average at best. The man was nice, but didn't really pay much attention to us. He was a little casual, and although the atmosphere is casual, when you work in a restaurant that doesn't serve your normal americanized mexican fare, you should make an effort to make sure your customers questions are answered."}
{"text":"We were served a basket of bread and salsa almost immediately, but we had to ask for drinks.... seems the drink order should be taken first.  Other than this, the service was excellent. This is the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. The food was fabulous.  My partner had the pork pabil (spelling?) and it was rich and flavorful.  I had the hatch chile seasonal special.... I could have licked my plate!  We did order the tableside guacamole... it was fresh and tastey but needed a little more heat.  I love the cozy atmosphere too...."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Hidden gem. Don't let its surroundings fool you. Great atmosphere and awesome art on the wall; inside and out."}
{"text":"Food - So amazing. I have never had anything that wasn't excellent.  Drinks - These guys know how to make margaritas.   Space - The only reason its 4 instead of 5. The place is not big enough to contain their greatness."}
{"text":"Just about everything was overpriced except for my favorite dish- Filet de mi Tita! I've been to BC at least five or six times and I seldom wander from this dish. It's a must have!   The Horchata and agua de Tamarindo is smooth and cold. At least half the time, they've run out so better get there a little early."}
{"text":"We used to come here several years ago, then traveled through Mexico for two years; excited to try out El Barrio Cafe after gaining some Mexican food expertise in Mexico.  We were hesitant to come again after reading some of the concerns expressed by Yelp reviewers.  We had such a good experience several years ago; we didn't want it followed by a bad one.  Thankfully however, we had a WONDERFUL dinner with EXCELLENT service from Claudia, our server.  The wait was not long, the service was very friendly, and the portions on par with prices.  For the people expressing disappointment in pairing guacamole with cranberries or pomegranate:  stay home!  This is all part of the experience and this is how it is done in various parts of Mexico.  They make the guacamole at your table and you can guide them in what you want added to it (more spices, less onions, no fruits, as you wish).  If you are not adventurous and want the same old stuff, this is not the place for you!  Waiting at a restaurant that doesn't take reservation is also part of the experience.  We went early, also taking advantage of happy hour and didn't wait long.  Our server had much more time to explain various foods we asked about.    We received free dessert in apologies for having to wait for our appetizer.  We didn't think we waited that long but our server thought so...  First she offered free guacamole which we turned down so she insisted on free dessert.    All in all still a great place to eat.  We will back."}
{"text":"It was New Year eve 2014 and our first time to try out this neighborhood café as it has been highly recommended by the Auto club in its 2013 Arizona tour book for the Phoenix metro area. We ordered a seafood appetizer, the obligatory Cochinita Pibil, as it was the top recommendation by AAA, and el Pato en Tamarindo. The ambiance was excellent and the service was exceptional.   When it comes to food, the Cochinita Pibil was a great disappointment. Cochinita Pibil is supposedly to be slow roasted pork. Such cooking process supposes to seal the fat and the juice in the meat and to prevent the meat from becoming too dry and tough and yet keeping the full natural flavor. Unfortunately, I can only describe that the \"portion of pork\" picked for and served in our plate as an overcooked pulled pork with a mushy texture, similar to that of sardines in a can.  If not because of the sauce, the taste itself was so bland as if the meat has been boiled in water for hours to extract flavor for broth. We left the whole plate untouched after we had the chance to sample it.  On a positive note, the appetizer and the seared duck breast saved the night. The seafood appetizer was not in the regular menu and we were told it was only offered especially for the end of the year. The texture of the shrimp and squid was crunchy and tender. The taste of the sauce was exquisite and it served with three large pieces of toast that one can dunk it into the sauce.  The duck breast was seared perfectly with enough pink. The meat was tender and juicy. The tamarind/chipotle pepper sauce had a kick with a well balance of sweetness and sourness, which complemented real well with the duck meat."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for a surprise Date Night out and What a Find. The Guac with Pomegranite Seeds was a great touch. My wife had the fish tacos and I had the pork and steak, It was just like being in Rocky point only safer and better. The atmosphere was great we went on a thursday night and had a great time, got seated fairly quick and the place was crowded and upbeat. You have to try it you will like it!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place, had high hopes.  Definitely disappointed. Food was just average, and a bit pricey. No chips and salsa?  They bring a tapenade with bread, which was just okay. The guacamole was good, but for $12 not a big portion, and I've had much better elsewhere. Richard was our server and offered no warm greeting or warmness of any kind.  Actually seemed annoyed and arrogant. Will not be back. The Taco Guild is much better, and offers a little less attitude."}
{"text":"My girlfriend saw Barrio Cafe on \"Diners, drive-ins and dives\" and wanted to go while visiting Phoenix.  Not your typical Mexican fare. The bread and salsa an unusual twist but very good. The table side guacamole was amazing!! We ordered the enchiladas suiza and a pork dish. Both dishes incredibly flavorful. Portions are large-you can definitely share.  I had their signature margarita which was more sour than most.....but great.  Not an inexpensive dinner out, but a must try!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed guacamole at multiple places around the Phoenix area, but the twist offered here is absolutely the best. Just an all around lovely atmosphere and selection of delicious options."}
{"text":"Barrio is serious about quality and imagination when it comes to Mexican food. Don't let the address or neighborhood fool you. There is no meal like this in Scottsdale. This is a no hype, all taste achievement experience for your senses. If Barrios can find a way to maintain what they have accomplished and open a few more of these around town, that would be delightful. If expansion takes away anything from this masterpiece, then leave it just like it is."}
{"text":"Heard great things about Barrio Cafe, so had to try it. Was disappointed with the food, however this is a regional acquired taste. The molé was dark and had that burnt taste which I don't care for. This type (region) of Mexican food does not appeal to me. The place is clean. Was a bit pricey. The server was average. Nothing wowed me."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  The food was awesome,  the service average.  The menu immediately strikes you as being different. The ingredients and descriptions of the dishes are delightful.  I rarely give 5 stars and this is definately a 5 star establishment.  Knock a couple of rough edges off of the wait staff and the whole experience would be spectacular.  Come early,  there is usually a wait to get in."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the valley with the best table side Guacamole. If you don't want the standard fare the Pescado  Del  Mar (halibut with shrimp, scallops, crab and lobster and  white wine cream sauce) is unbelievable. I've been at least a dozen times and everything has been great"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing. Chiles en Nogada is all that. Cochinita Pibil had good flavor, but a bit dry. Pollo Poblano was fantastic. The mashed potatoes...whatever is in them, I don't know, but it is delicious. Flan is thick and delicious with perfectly toasted and candied pecans. Service is exceptional. Art is great. We had a Cuban trio playing on Saturday night...man! Just go here."}
{"text":"I love mole. I mean, I COVET mole and when I see it on a menu I get it. I've eaten mole in probably 30 restaurants all over the country and this is the most luscious, complex, transporting recipe I've had. Perfectly balanced with a sophisticated exoticness and just the right amount of heat. Chicken was juicy. Mom had fish tacos, just fabulous. As everyone says, definitely get the guacamole, the addition of the pomegranate seeds makes a perfect balance with the tangy avocado and crispy, fresh chips, just droolworthy. Try one of the tequilas neat, they have so many varieties, I especially love Herradura Anejo which you don't find a lot. Service is usually quite good, the servers are knowledgeable and if they're not slammed will be happy to give recommendations. When its really busy they can be a little slow.   Yes, its pricey. Yes, you'll probably have to wait a looooooong time for a table (weekend dinner - fugedaboudit)  and there are few places to sit while you do so make sure grandma has her cane, mine was pissed she had to stand so long. But after her quesidillas and tequila she was a happy nana."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because we saw it on TV on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, but realize now that should have been a reason not to try it. Barrio Cafe is overpriced and underwhelming.   On the show we saw the chef prepare a chili  relano, but when we went to order it, there's none on the menu. Instead, we went for the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos. We started with the \"award winning\" horchata.   We must have got some from the bottom of the barrel because it was super grainy and gross. I didn't even drink mine at $5.50. The tacos and enchiladas were both fine, but nothing special.  With the amount of hype surrounding this place we expected more - especially for $20 a person or more."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  My enchiladas rojas were cold and had to go back.  The flan didn't taste fresh. However, our waiter was great."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican food so I put Mexican food in google maps and this came up. I thought the reviews are good, so why not? It was everything I didn't expect. There's NO rice and beans and that's a Mexican food staple, it killed my soul, that's not Mexican food. The margaritas are way over priced, I've had better in Scottsdale for cheaper! The only reason I gave it two stars was the carne asada taco was pretty good and the salsa was great. One time stop for me because 60$ for sub-par \"Mexican food\" is something I'll never do again."}
{"text":"Soo fun and funky with stellar ingredients.  Loved the elote in the glass cup excellent and strong Margs.. Love the vibe and unique and interesting menu. I can't wait to go back and try more things. Star docked for huge glop of fat on pork taco ( like half the taco) and spotty service.  Felt like we were inconveniencing our server by asking for larger plates than the B and B ones he gave us to share our meals . (We ordered several things to share ) I was afraid to ask him for some chips to go with elote so I sopped up the goodness with the delicious bread they offer..  Get the churros with goat milk caramel . Wow"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had dining out!!! The pork was so tender that you could pull it with your fork. The flavors were amazing, all the way from the guacamole to the dinners , to the dessert. We had the  churros for dessert and they were so tasty!! I thank my brother in law for recommending this place to us. We will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent original south Mexican food. Our dinner was superb, the staff very attentive. It's a little hard to find, but it's worth the inconvenience.  Don't go to Phoenix with out trying this place !"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Such an outside the box twist on traditional Mexican food! My friend got the Sangria, it's mixed with Jack Daniels and it was delicious! My margarita was so refreshing. This is a must eat restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Oh and btw, great live music! Food came out fast and was so fresh!"}
{"text":"Starting off the meal with Chones is not always great. But when Chones is a drink is a blend of horchata and chambord then things will be good! We ate food that made our head explode because of the fusion of flavor. We started with elote. It was a street elote in a cup. A good step towards the main course. Our plates arrived with  Cochinito Pibil and chiles en nogada. The flavor was over the top. My Chiles had an fun combination of chicken, pomegranate, crema, pecans and chile that was a welcomed distraction from a normal stuffed chiles. Desert was the churros and ice cream combination.  Everything tasted amazing, homemade and made just for you. There was a great little cubano duo playing.   This place is a hit!"}
{"text":"The best authentic mexican food in town! Killer margaritas and tequila selection!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Visited here on a trip to Phoenix, from LA, and had some of the best freshly made guacamole (made at our table), chicken enchiladas, tortas and carne asada tacos!! We topped it off with the most amazing carymel-drizzled churros....mmmm mmmm, yummy!! The service was great as well. Keep in mind, they don't take reservations and our wait was about 40 mins on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"I still wonder what all the commotion is all about here? My grandma makes better mole than these people... Way too over priced... Like extremely"}
{"text":"The food here is DELICIOUS!  The Margaritas are fantastic!  The staff is WONDERFUL!  I ate here with my 2 year old son and my husband and the entire staff was so sweet to my little boy.  They were all very warm and friendly.  It almost felt like we were having dinner with friends.  They had live entertainment the night that we were there, which made the experience that much better.  The only criticism that I have is that it was pretty hot inside the restaurant.  I give a bit of a pass on this though because it was 120 degrees this particular weekend and the cold air must have just been leaving the restaurant every time the door opened...  I will be going back to Barrio Cafe the next time I visit Phoenix.  :)"}
{"text":"This casual, unassuming place is fantastic!  Blown away by the carnitas and chicken enchiladas! They were both amazing!! Highly recommend.  This certainly seems like a place a person could eat at once a week! Great service with wonderful dinner recommendations. I doubt anything on the menu isn't amazing. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I should have followed my own pat advice I give time and time again:  If you want to go the best authentic ethnic restaurant, you have to go where the ethnics go;  so that should pretty much sum up the experience here.     Waaaaay overrated, waaaaaay overpriced.  I was waaaaaay disappointed after hearing all the fabulous reviews from the Anglos.  Don't we live close to the border?     Home cooked or authentic?  Put it this way, go where the Mexicans go to eat if you don't mind being stared at.   How do I know?  I treated my staff, a party of home grown Mexicans, to this gourmet mexican;   we were seriously the ONLY ethnics there.  The ONLY other authentic mexican ethnics we saw there were the guys clearing out the plates.  When my girlfriends spoke to them in spanish and asked what THEY thought about the authenticity of the food, we got a smile;  that was enough---I hope we don't cost the poor guy his job.     Pork dish:  drowned in sauce that all taste was gone.   Beef:  do you like beef jerky?    Repeat after me:  ask where all the ethnics go to eat if you want fabulous authentic ethnic food.   If you want a cute place to bring a date and to impress by shelling a lot of money for a little payback afterwards, this is the place for you!   Not for the gourmande.  Just because a place is expensive doesn't mean it is fabo."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when a client wanted to have lunch here today- it had been ages since my last visit and honestly, I tend to stop visitng a place once \"those\" people have discovered it.  You know who \"they\" are- the ones that call this a bad neighborhood and whose idea of adventerous food is ordering a pasta instead of the soup/salad combo at Olive Garden for lunch.    I was pleasantly surprised at the service after everything I've read lately.  Our server was respectful of the \"business\" at the table and helpful when I couldn't make up my mind.   He pushed me to the Ensalada de Pato.  The spinach and mangos were vibrant, they didn't spare on the toasted pine nuts, the spicy naranja supremes were a pleasant surprise and roquefort cheese and queso fresco were sparingly perfect.  The roasted duck was just perfect and I was oh so happy that I was persuaded to get this salad.   I would recommend waiting until 1pm if you want to meet here and actually conduct business (it's a little too noisy otherwise).    I wish I knew our server's name- he was just right.  I'm looking forward to coming back (just not with \"them\")."}
{"text":"Husband and I were the first costumers on a Sunday morning. We were greeted and seated right away even though they still had a good 5-10 min from opening time. We live in the east coast but were in AZ for the weekend. As we had heard many times, Arizona has the best Mexican food, this place didn't disappoint. Server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Micheladas were perfect and the food was just finger-licking delicious. If ever in AZ we will definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio Cafe three times, and was happy the first two times. This last Saturday, it was disappointing because of the incompetent server. After getting our drinks, he didn't come back for quite a bit. Then he took our orders, but returned in 10 minutes to take them again because he forgot two of the three orders. Next, he came to the table unsure whether all three got salads. He figured that out and gave my salad and delivered the other two to a different table. 20 minutes later he came to check if we had received our food. When it showed up a few minutes later, my carne asada was cold and the tortillas had begun to dry out."}
{"text":"Good tacos and great selection. Arguably a little over priced but well above average real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Today, I tried Barrio Cafe for the first time. After hearing great things about this place, didn't think it could go wrong. The food is good (not bad, not great), but is pricey relative to the quality. Also, if the waiter doesn't believe you speak Spanish, but believes someone else at the table does, you'll be ignored the rest of the night. Conversations over you, etc. You might as well elect them as the spokesperson and order/request things through this person. Terrible! From the moment we walked in until we got our check. Glad I experienced it to say I've been, but don't plan to go again. Oh, the margaritas were pretty good (but pricey of course)! 2 stars for the margarita, 1 for the food. 3 out of 5 total."}
{"text":"Sad, sad, sad. That's how I feel after my recent meal at the Barrio Cafe. Had I written this review just a couple years ago, I would have said, \"joyous, joyous, joyous.\" My how times have changed. I once held Barrio in very high esteem, recommended it to out of town visitors, and regularly thought of it as some of the best Mexican food I had enjoyed outside of Mexico. Well, no more... Went last Saturday night and I seriously thought it had new owners. The dirty truth... Service: Terrible, terrible service. From the host, to the bartender, to the server, we received rushed, unfriendly, inattentive treatment. When entrees are in the $20+ range I expect better service than what I've experienced at most fast food joints.  Food:  Who stopped caring in the kitchen? It used to feel like the food was lovingly made by a gourmet Mexican grandma. Now it was just slopped on the plate. We ordered the table side guac and it was thrown together so fast and the server didn't even take the time to ask how we wanted it (spice, mild, etc.). It was fine but not as special as on previous visits. My favorite seasonal dish is the Chilis en Nogada - a whole chili stuffed with chicken and dried fruits with a creamy almond sauce and fresh pomegranates. In this past, this dish was dreamy! On this night it was a nightmare. Dried out chicken, bland chile, and so sweet it was barely edible. Also, it was served with a side of cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes that added absolutely nothing to the dish. After an experience like that, I'm sad to say Barrio is officially off my list."}
{"text":"Great recipes and flavor - felt kinda rushed as we just flew into town, 2 of us from Tokyo and we wanted relax and take in the menu. The server was helpful, but moving faster than we were.  Fully enjoyed our orders though  Great atmosphere.  The Cochinita Pibile and the Chiles en Nogada were excellent.  Hope to go back sometime,.  we highly recommend Barrio Cafe.  Oh,, the music was really great too,, added to a festive outing."}
{"text":"Pro Loved the live music Good ambience Boyfriends tacos where good Mashed potatoes where really good  Con Mole was extra dry and sauce wasn't that good Service was slow Price was too much for the quality   I don't mind paying a high amount for food as long as the taste matches the price.  This place was not one of those places. I really wanted to like this place.  A little upset.  Sorry it was too dark for photos but I tried"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in the city.. Small place no reservations but food worth the wait. Go early on weekends or be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"Great great great food. Holy Mole(the dish)! It was soooo good. My BF had a margarita that was awesome as well.  Heard they have a new Scottsdale location. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"I dream of the shrimp tacos weekly! The only bad thing about barrios is that it's so far from Tempe! This place is great!!"}
{"text":"We dined at Barrio last week on a Monday night and the place was packed. I was super impressed by the menu and the food. Very generous portions and the sauces were amazing. Don't go here is you are looking for New Mexico food....the flavors at Barrion were bold and creative. Also, don't expect New Mexico prices but, for me, the food was worth the prices. Very cute atmosphere too. I will make this a priority on my next trip to Phoenix.  P.S. I did fell our waiter was arrogant. Almost like he didn't want to be working that night or we were too much trouble for him to be serving us. He's the guy with the goatee. Needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"This place was pricy for Mexican food, but damn was it good.  The tomatillo sauce in the enchiladas suizas is the best I've ever had. And the cheese they put in that dish is beyond.. a little sweet and tangy.  And the churros are warmed and injected with some type of devilsih caramel creme.  Come on!  They're trying to put me in a food coma.  Great horchata.  And very simple and tasty guacamole.  It's better with the pomegranates than the cranberries."}
{"text":"Barrio did not live up to expectations. The restaurant itself was not inviting. The echo made the place feel cold, more like a storage room.   The food was utterly forgettable. Bland and boring. I am not that hard to please and this food failed on every level.   The server was attentive in the beginning but after the entrees were dropped- we were forgotten. We finally found someone to help us and got the dessert to the table and even that was gross. Which I find unbelievable.       The positives: the bathroom decor is very cool. The margarita was the best I have ever had. And I do not say that statement lightly. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Really good food here. I had dinner here years ago while visiting. Now that I live in Phoenix I try to eat here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Incredible food and incredible service. Can't wait to visit again! This Californian loves Barrio!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. I love the suiza enchiladas! I add grilled jalapeños to the delicious side of zucchini, corn and onions that come with the dish. The margaritas are delicious as well! I recommend visiting early before the lunch rush or for a late lunch on a week day as they are usually very busy. I don't like waiting very long- although when the craving is strong enough I will!!"}
{"text":"Great carne Assad tacos an salad bread not warm an salsa no traditional but over all great service"}
{"text":"It's just ok.  Not worth the price or the long wait.  The service was not good.  I won't go back.  The food is authentic and diverse but just doesn't taste good.  I tried three dishes, the slow roasted pork, the tamarindo duck and the stuffed chile.  They were poor, ok and good in that order.  The pork was dry, even with the juices poured over it.  The duck was lost in the tamarindo sauce.  I like tamarindo so it was ok, but some of the flavor of the duck should have come through.  The stuffed chile was really nice.  For the sides, the calabasas (squash medley) were good and so were the potatoes, I would have gone with roasted instead of mashed if there was a choice.  For portions, only the pork was a good sized dish.  The duck was just right and the chile was not enough food.  It is nice to see a Mexican restaurant try to expose people to things besides enchiladas with a side of rice and beans.  They just need to make the food better, lower their prices, take reservations and fire our dour waitress."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Only came because we seen it on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives however I'd rather save my money and try something different. Nothing memorable or calling me to come back. The only thing that was good was their churro. Atmosphere is authentic, but a tight squeeze and if I recall there were a few annoying flies."}
{"text":"I came here with family and got to try a lot of things. The queso fundido lacked flavor. I was missing the chorizo kick. My aunt's first order of tacos were inedible because they were over salted. The beef tacos that replaced the first set were lackluster. The wrap around the enchilada suizas was weirdly tough. My duck entree as ok but not worth the price. My favorite things were the agua de horchata and agua de Jamaica and mashed potatoes. It was all just so strange for a hip Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could cook and I could own a café - it would be something like this!  Excellent HH drinks, cold beer, and good sangria. The appetizers were very good, but on this day the only small nitpick complaint was that the Posole was a touch too salty.   No one needs 3,000 words to review the Barrio Café. My suggestions is to try it once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"churro was the best i ever had, their corn tortilla was somewhat dry on the edges but that is to be expected with that type of tortilla, they also only have corn tortilla and no flour since that is the traditional tortilla used for tacos. I ended up only eating the filling of my tacos since i do not like corn tortillas."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my co-workers yesterday. The food was excellent, and that's why this place deserves 5 stars. I had a salad and my coworkers for the mole' chicken and tacos. The guac was excellent too. I think everyone finished their plates. If there is any complaint about this place, it's that the food was a little on the pricey side (for lunch). If you come here, be ready to spend about $20 per person, and maybe more if you drink alcohol.  I did glance at the Sunday brunch menu, and that looked excellent and well priced. I will make sure to go here for Sunday brunch. Otherwise, I will only go here if I am looking to impress a girl or if I win the lottery."}
{"text":"No parking!!!!    Unfriendly staff except bartender.  He was trying but quite marginal.  OMG!!!!!  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB? REALLY???  Not our first time, gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes, after 20 minutes went by, another 15-20 minutes, etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!    Wasn't greeted when we entered, not even a \"Hi, can I help you?\"  Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I don't have a big car!  The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.  Well, the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad, one appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!  No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.  The female waitress, again, seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food, plates were plopped down on the tables, she came to check on us twice, 2nd time, the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came.   The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!!   Service and the meals didn't match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place. Small dinning area and there is only one bathroom. I feel like it is completely over priced for what you get and it is not worth the half an hour wait. Also their horchata is award winning but La Santisima has better horchata in my opinion. I don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"I walked in and right away could tell this was not a place for me and my wife. The host didn't know what elote was. We sat down and they brought us bread with this fancy olive spread. The tacos are over priced. The guacamole was good but still 12 bucks. The only thing I really enjoyed was the horchata and the paintings."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 but, I want to try it again to make sure. Very tasty Mole. good drinks. Great atmosphere. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Would have given this pace a higher rating but...  The drinks were exceptional.  absolutely delicious. Guacamole was so-so.  a lot of hype, but wasn't mixed too well at table side.  a little high priced for adding some pomegranate seeds to avocado.  both are pretty cheap, so the price tag didn't justify it. Tacos were very very good with the spicy fries, loved it!  The salad my wife had was the worst.  Lazy chef had it missing most of the key ingredients from the menu.  looked like a bowl of spinach with a bit of cotija tossed in.  Thankfully our server took it off the menu.  great location and ambience, great service, food was decent, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is an amazing place to get inspired and creative Mexican food.  The lemon and pomegranate seeds in the un-mashed guacamole is unique and nicely balanced, served table side with awesome homemade tortilla chips.  But be careful not to fill up on bread and appetizers because the entrees are big portions.  I've loved all the entrees I've tried here, usually smothered in intensely flavorful sauces and served with delicious spicy mash and grilled zucchini.  The margaritas are also awesome.  The service is very quick and friendly; our waiter was happy to give us extra chips to take home.  The space is intimate and comfortable with live guitar music being played near the bar.  Be sure to check out the amazing street art that covers the building on your way in or out."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican venue in Phoenix. I always end of dining there when in town. Last week I took a friend from Orange County and he said it was better than anywhere in LA. Everything on the menu is great. Their chef is very creative. The atmosphere is the finishing touch."}
{"text":"The dichotomy between the \"love it\" or \"hate it\" reviews of Barrio Cafe can be traced back to the concept for this restaurant.  This place isn't trying to replicate the standard Mexican neighborhood joint.  There is also a misconception in the US that Mexican food is universally spicy -- it's not, that's Tex-Mex.  If you're looking for hyper-spicy food, go to Los Dos Molinos instead.  If you're ready for sublime and subtle modern/urban Mexican food, then Barrio Cafe is the place for you.  Just be prepared that a dinner with drinks will not fall into the wallet-friendly category at Barrio Cafe.  The focus of Barrio Cafe is southern Mexican food as reinterpreted by Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza as well as her original creations.  While the food is pricey and the portions have been noticeably reduced recently, you can pretty much throw a dart at the menu and pick out a winning dish.  For appetizers, many diners are beguiled by the table-side preparation of the \"elegant\" Guacamole Casero.  To avoid disappointment, please note that the guacamole is only prepared at your table during dinner.  At lunch, it is prepped in the kitchen.  While the guacamole is good (and even better when pomegranates are in season as the seeds add a tangy crunch), it is a bit spendy at $10.50 for a moderate serving.  Splash out $16 and try the Quesadilla de Langosta Borracha (lobster quesadilla) since it's a unique dish you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in Phoenix.  The Sopa de Chile Morron (sweet and spicy pepper soup) is divine due to its silky/creamy texture.  If you ask, they will divide the bowl into two cups so that you can share it with another lucky diner.  The entrees offer a robust and varied selection of delicious dishes.  The Cochinita Pibil (12 hour slow roasted pork) is succulent and well-rounded in flavor due to the achiote rojo & sour orange.  When pomegranates are in season, the Chiles en Nogada (roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sauce and pomegranates) is the standout dish from the menu and my standard order.  The BF's standard order is the Enchiladas Suizas (chicken enchiladas with tomatillo cream sauce).  The seafood enchiladas and the mushroom enchiladas are both excellent choices as well.  For lunch, the Torta de Pollo y Jaiba (Chicken breast topped with crab and spicy hollandaise) is an excellent choice.  It's certainly not low-cal, but it's utterly delicious.  If you manage to spare enough room for dessert, go for the signature option, Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (fritters stuffed with goat's milk caramel).  You'll marvel at how they managed to fill the churros with all that tasty caramel.  They also offer a special Domingo menu for Sunday brunch.  The regular menu is also available during brunch, but options such as the Crepa de Pollo (chicken and asparagus filled crepe with a jocoqui sauce) should garner your attention.  Barrio Cafe offers a tremendous selections of tequila.  Their cocktails are all delicious, but be warned that they're strong and pricey.  The BF loves a good Paloma (Patron Reposado with Mexican Squirt soda and lime) and he enjoys the version at Barrio.  I enjoy the mango margarita.   The only negative point is around portion size.  When Barrio Cafe first opened in 2002, I thought then that the portions were a bit small for the prices.  Over time, the portions increased and the pricing seemed fair.  On my most recent visit, the portions had noticeably decreased again, but the prices had not.  Even our Skinny Minnie friends remarked that the portions were small.  Beyond the tremendous food, Barrio Cafe offers a funky atmosphere with \"interesting\" art on the walls.  Sometimes the art is quite good, sometimes it is just plain awful, but it's always a conversation point.  The restaurant is small and full of hard surfaces, so sound bounces all over the place.  It can get quite loud on weekend nights and the live music on the weekends adds to the din.  Try to sit away from the musicians and delight in a rare treat of a near-transcendental Mexican dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Guacamole was out of the world! Would recommend over and over again. I ordered the enchilada with chorizo which came with an okay side of vegetables. Pricey, the guacamole cost $12 alone for a cereal sized bowl and in-house made chips. Definitely deliciousness."}
{"text":"I love anything here. I've gone at least 4 times already and haven't had a bad meal yet. Sometimes the service is iffy, but I'd rather have a chile and deal with the service, than not go at all."}
{"text":"Upon arriving in Phoenix and on our way to the hotel, we decided to find some southwestern food and using Yelp, found this place. I admit, it wasn't the best looking place in the best neighborhood, but I never did feel out of place or unsafe. The parking is in the back as the street parking is not really available. When you go around, you'll find ample parking and some nice artwork.  You can enter either through the back or front. The place was not too busy when entered, but after a short while got really hopping!  We had some beer and Michelada's to start, then was served an olive-based salad with bread, which was awesome. For dinner we had Cochinita Pibil Tortas and Filetito Torta. Both entrees were excellent, served fairly quickly.  Our service was very good, even when the place got busy. Really pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"Just ok in my opinion. Pretty disappointed in our dishes. The guacamole was excellent though."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as advertised and then some. For starters we had the Esquites - absolutely amazing, could have made dinner w a few more dishes of their delicious buttered roasted corn. For mains we both had the house speciality Cochinita Pibil.   To. Die. For.   Savory with just enough sweetness, the pork was perfectly tender and the pickled onions and Yucatan pico give it absolutely brilliant contrasts.   This is one of those restaurants that should be on everyone's list when they visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Barrio is on my short list when I'm visiting Phoenix. Their Cochinita Pibil is better than mine, and I'm okay with that. It's tender and juicy and I eat every last bite. The only aspect in which my C.P. exceeds theirs is the fresh habanero salsa I serve on the side. I'm writing this review from my POV, thus the four stars; however, I made the mistake of recommending the dark mole to a dinner companion, which turned out to be much more earthy, smokey and strong tasting than I recall. Too much char on the chilis, perhaps? I couldn't blame my friend for getting through less than half his plate. (Perhaps this is a matter of personal preference, but I enjoyed the moles in Oaxaca much more.) All in all, I still highly recommend this restaurant for its quality ingredients and authentic flavors."}
{"text":"Start with the horchata and then get anything else. We were cruising for some authentic Mexican food and that is exactly what we found!!  Service was unparalleled and the food was amazing.   I asked my party to each describe their meal in a single word and below are the results::  Zesty Tasty Balanced  Complex"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, from the charm when you walk in, to the friendly staff, to the over the top delicious meal. I went here right after i got engaged and enjoyed it so much! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place.  DIdn't quite deliver.  The positives:  the duck is AMAZING!  The negatives:  high pricing for portion size, weak but ridiculously expensive drinks for the area, a menu that didn't offer many adventuresome dishes.  The restaurant is extremely loud... small quarters with stone walls and you couldn't hear any dinner conversation.  Service is OK, but no one is overly friendly.  Art on the wall is nice, but looks like it was done by an elementary school kid yet has $500 price tags."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times for lunch. This was my first experience for dinner. Of course the food was delicious. So now you're wondering why the three stars? Well here is why..... I didn't want to give it less because the food is consistently great. However, the service last night was horrendous.  Our waiter had no sense of urgency. I finished my drink and had to ask the hostess for another beer. This was a birthday dinner and my wife was not happy. We were a party of four and we had to wait and ask for everything. Table next to us was waited on by a waitress. They were also a party of four, seated at least 15 min after our arrival. They were done eating and left half way through our meal.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fabulous. I'd go more often if I didn't live 2 hours away. Service was first rate. Fresh bread served with a side of Olive tapinade while you're waiting to order, which didn't take long at all. The guacamole with pomegranate seeds was exquisite and the accompanying tortilla chips were light and delicious. I ordered the mango, tomato, avacadi, shrimp salad which was light and refreshing as well as delicious. My sister-in-law ordered a pepper stuffed with meat and cheese and that was awesome too. It also came with a side of wonderful, fresh made mashed potatoes and sauteed zucchini. I can't say enough. This was my first time there, but it definitely won't be my last."}
{"text":"Interesting artwork on walls, a variety of margaritas (the standard house margarita is just fine and the best value!) and great food. The place is small and almost cramped, and busy when we were there on a Monday. It says $$ but I'd say it's a bit more $$$, and service was slow. The bread and bruschetta(?) nibbles while we waited were not liked by my dinner mate but it was good in my opinion. However, all was forgiven when the food arrived. My tacos (1 mushroom and the rest pork) were awesome, as was the side salad. We left fat and happy."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch.  Amazing pollo and asparagus crepe. The best brunch I've had"}
{"text":"By far the freshest, super cool, Mexican offerings in the valley. A great combination of authentic food with a modern vibe and obvious pride in what they do. I've never brought a guest who was not impressed."}
{"text":"When I want to impress visitors, celebrate with friends or just have a damn good meal, it's Barrio Cafe. The thoughtfulness and creativity of the menu reflect Chef Silvana's pride in authentic flavors of the different regions of Mexico. The staff are welcoming and the atmosphere embraces you, adding to the full experience. Barrio has elevated Mexican cuisine to the level of elegance it has rarely seen. Bravo! Brava!"}
{"text":"If authentic Mexican is what you want, this is not the place. It's more like Southwestern fusion inspired by classic Mexican dishes.   I enjoyed the complimentary olive spread served with bread. The spread was fresh and packed with great salty olive flavor. It was more like Italian than Mexican, but delicious!   The margarita with agave was well done (a bit sweeter and less tart, which suits my taste!).  The guacamole is freshly made table side but under-seasoned for my palate. The fresh pomegranate gave it an added texture and burst of flavor. The chips were  slightly thicker, crisp, crunchy, and fresh and not oily. Excellent!   My friend and I ordered chiles de nogada and it had an interesting fruity/savory flavor, but even with walnuts, it lacked texture and was mushy. The poblano was overcooked. The side of pico de gallo and beans that came with the chiles en nogada were dry and overpowered with a cumin flavor.  The scallop/shrimp poblano dish was served with what seemed to be steamed thick cut zucchini that was bland.  The cheesy white sauce overpowered the fresh poblano flavor, which is usually my favorite part!   The flan was very dense (on the dry side) and too sweet. The chocolate cake had a hint of cinnamon and was freshly made with a side of ice cream. It was good. Coffee was fresh and came in a French press. Nice touch.   Overall, the food wasn't altogether bad and had some creative elements. The food definitely didn't satisfy my Mexican food cravings  developed from my childhood memories of eating the 'real deal' in South Tucson.   I would go back with different expectations (Southwestern fusion vs authentic Mex) to try a few other dishes. So far, the only thing I'd repeat order is the guacamole and chips (loved the chips!)...oh, and I'd have a few margaritas on the rocks, too! Happy hour may be my next visit.  I don't mind paying more for something really special. They were a bit pricey at $21 per poblano dish. Overall, we spent $150 for two (including tip).   I will end on a positive note. The vibe was hip and fun, and the service was prompt, friendly, homey, and not pretentious."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE! Very creative Mexican food you will not find anywhere else! Unique! Love the funky vibe! A good Sunday afternoon adventure to see and experience something new! Wonderful service. Great Rita's! It was pricey but very worth it for a special occasion! You can even review it on Diners Drive Ins & Dives.... it really isn't any of those because it has charm, it's clean & it's quaint!  Enjoyed all dishes! The house specialty was the bomb!!!! Just go for it!!!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks ago and definitely enjoyed the atmosphere. The staff was really friendly which made up for the endless loop of Buena Vista Social Club and Gyspsy Kings blaring from the speakers (I thought this place was Mexican, no?) The table-side prepared guacamole was surprisingly good with the added dried cranberries, but my chicken with black mole was only so-so. The mole sauce was really watery and kind of plain in flavor, which was disappointing because I heard that the mole was one of Barrio Cafe's strengths. The chicken itself was cooked well, though. Juicy and not dry. Maybe I caught Barrio Cafe on a bad mole night? Who knows.   I went back again for dinner some weeks later and had a pollo poblano dinner which, again, was alright, but for the price (almost $18) I wasn't remotely sure if it was worth it.   I'll go back again, because I really liked the place itself, but it definitely seems like it thrives more on the hype and atmosphere than the actual food."}
{"text":"This isn't your traditional Mexican food & they don't just hand you chips & salsa when you enter... but it doesn't matter... the food is PHENOMENAL. Everything on the menu is PHENOMENAL. This is probably one of the best restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I am really surprised at the high ratings.  The service was absolutely terrible the entire time, and at the end of the dinner we were surprised to see 20% gratuity added on our party of 7.  I asked for water 3 times and waited for a extremely long time for our meal. I try to put service aside because you never know if they were short staffed etc.  The tableside guac portion is extremely small $11.75.  I had the mole enchiladas, which were served cold. The flavor was pretty good but it was a basic chicken enchiliada with mole on top for $20.  Overall, I thought the food was decent and would probably pay for it at 60% of what is charged (especially given the location).  I really don't see what was innovative or standout in any of the 7 dishes our table ordered.  If anything, I think this place benefited from the Guy hype and lack of competition in the marketplace.  This place would not survive in a foodie town."}
{"text":"Hats off to the Barrio Cafe and there staff to a wonderful dinning experience. Had to wait an hour to get a table which gave us time to sample their margarita list and enjoy the live music on the patio. Resturant is simple In decor with cool artwork to keep you intrigued.  All the patrons were in a great mood as the unique dishes kept pouring out of the kitchen. All four of our entrees were awesome with the two fish dishes rising to the top. Good time ! Great food!!"}
{"text":"Barrio is quintessential AZ food.  Not my most favorite place, I love Chips and Salsa and without it, a meal takes a hit.  Other than that, get the guacamole."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place because I constantly see people here and the reviews are really good.  It's definitely not your normal Mexican spot...they don't have rice or beans and they don't serve chips and salads. Instead they serve bread and some other stuff with it...it was okay....the waiter was okay....he was kinda rude when we asked if the had rice and beans he said \"no we don't serve that, whatever you see on the menu is what you get\". It was obviously our first time here and he didn't care to explain how this place isn't the typical Mexican restaurant. I ordered GREEN enchiladas and when I got my food they were RED. The chicken isn't even shredded in the Tortilla it's literally like a whole chicken breasts. I tried to eat it, but it just wasn't good. So I told the waiter this isn't what I ordered and he looked at his paper and said \"oh yeah you're right\". Umm okay I know I'm right. So I asked him to take it off. My bf ordered chorizo with eggs and potatoes....the meal looked like a joke. First off the server forgot to add the chorizo and it only came out with 2 eggs and a very small side of potatoes for $15?!! He then brought the chorizo on the side in a small little cup that they serve ketchup in.   I don't recommend this place. Our service sucked and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch on a weekday. The staff was still pretty busy but customers were thinning out. Service was a little hit and miss. The waiter seemed exhusted. This restaurant is small and feels cramped. It's a little like dining with the people at the next table.  Our food was pretty good except the tampande was lacking flavor. The tacos were flavorful, the coffee was great.  It's a little expensive but it's definetly a better Mexican fare."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the food after watching a show on tv .. I tried the the Enchiladas suizas, good at first but, Chicken was hard, so much cream and cheese got tortillas soggy so much onions, should of called it Onion Enchiladas.The vegetable were ok the salad was good. My wife got the shrimp tacos kinda pricey for three tacos almost $4 a taco one shrimp and lots of cabbage the only thing that gave it flavor was the suace. I skipped the dessert . I could of ate at home save the drive and $$. First time and last ... Don't get me wrong , we were expecting an awesome flavor , but it didn't .."}
{"text":"I was in Tempe for a meeting and my hosts had taken me out for Italian and then Chinese food.  Having lived in Europe for the past six years I wanted Mexican for my last nights meal.  I googled \"Best Mexican food in Phoenix\" and the Barrio Café came up as #1.   We piled into the car and went.  The restaurant seems to be in a working-class area with a mix of residences and businesses There is parking out back and the exterior walls are painted with bold, slightly cultural graffiti paintings.  Baron Samedi is there, not sure why, and various skull-themed portraits.  There is a patio where you can have a drink while you wait for your table.  The view onto N 16th St is nothing to look at but if you order one of their signature Margueritas you won't care.  They are delicious.  As I was not driving and the meeting was over, I sampled a couple.  Some have fruit juices like pomegranate or chambord.  This is not traditional Mexican fare.  It's Mexican with some creative license.  I had a roasted corn salad dressed with a goats milk cheese and subtle flavorings.  Delicious.  For dinner I had a slow cooked suckling pig that had been wrapped in banana leaf.  It was quite good although looking at the plates of my colleagues I think I might have switched to one of their plates.  They loved their food.  Happy to have gone and would go again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service was good, the prices are reasonable, and the decor both inside and out has a lot of character. The horchata is very good and they give you a half liter of it. The only problem I have is that the portion was kind of small. I got the shrimp tacos and the plate has 3 tiny tacos with maybe two shrimps each. Even with the salad and complimentary bread I left still hungry. I will admit as a disclaimer that I do have a larger than average appetite and all I ate all day beforehand was a bagel and shmear for a late breakfast. I would like to explore the menu further, so I may be back."}
{"text":"Just short of 5 stars.   I went on a Sat. evening several months ago and finally got around to this.  A friend and I split 3 items:   Guacamole Casero (prepared tableside) - excellent! some Chile Relleno - a special that night, not on menu - excellent! Ensalada del Barrio - good - not incredible like the other two items  Wonderfully flavored food with a great combo of textures, which is essential for me.  The place is cute, welcoming and colorful.  Our server - a very engaging guy, forget his name - was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly - wonderful service.   The parking is scarce and it's pretty crowded, plus a long wait on weekends but that's to be expected because the food is great and word gets around!"}
{"text":"Delicious... Chiles en Nogada is truly off the chart a favorite.  Problem is each time I have it I'm left wanting more because it's so delicious and nothings left to bring home."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed. Soggy fries, soggy torta, soggy queso...SOGGY QUESO??? How is that possible??? My first thought was that it had to have been me but both my husband and cousin had similar thoughts. We had four different dishes and they all were under par. I was referred here by a chef friend, but this time, unfortunately, he was off :( I think the highlight of our meal was our drinks."}
{"text":"We use to love the Barrio Cafe--not sure if it was an off night or if they have slipped but both of our meals were terrible and we left after just taking a few bites--the guacamole as always was wonderful--the service and the margaritas were both as always wonderful--We did not make a big deal out of the fact our meals were inedible but my husband did mention to our waiter that his dinner consisted of only a couple of little chicken strips and the waiter said yes another customer had complained and the manager was aware--and it was obvious mine was going back after a few tastes--that was enough--both meals from their specials--it was disappointing we were not offered an apology--we didn't need a free meal--just a--sorry you didn't like your meal--expensive to be such poor quality--and again disappointing because it was so good---"}
{"text":"This place is an experience,from the service to the food it's all fantastic. Our waiter was knowledgeable of menu and made wonderful suggestions. The food is nothing like experienced before, will definitely return. Suggest trying the guacamole.....you won't regret it."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Seasonal dishes are highly recommended.  Award winning chef at a very local cafe."}
{"text":"I just don't get it. I don't understand why Barrio is such a hit. Did I hit my head and lose my sense of taste? I doubt it.   Barrio isn't horrible, but it certainly is not the most amazing Mexican cuisine that I have had. Barrio is the place that a guy who thinks he's in touch with La Raza (even though he grew up in Scottsdale)and takes his girlfriend to \"a little place in the ghetto\" he knows. For those of us that know what the Barrio is like, Barrio Cafe doesn't live up to its self proclaimed title of \"Comida Chingona\".   I had the pleasure of having dinner at Barrio with my friend Ayesha. One thing that Barrio Cafe does have going for it is their super potent margarita. Maybe that's what makes all the patrons think that the food is so amazing. I had a top shelf margarita. It was really good! The tequila was smooth and the the margarita mix was not too sweet, and not too sour! I overheard our bartender explaining that the margaritas are 50 percent tequila and the rest is mix. Nice! I should have drank more, maybe this review would be a little better for them.   We were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. He asked us if we would like the fresh made guacamole. Ayesha and I were both excited to try it. He brought around the cart and explained all that went into the guacamole. Well he mashed a bit and then served it to us....um... that's it? Really? It was chunks of avocado with the rest of the ingredients. Ok, you might impress some fools with that mess, but with those of us with mamas that have old, well used molcajetes... this guacamole isn't cutting it one bit. I had to snicker as one half drunk patron next to us declared this was the best guacamole she ever had. *sigh* I was not impressed at all. Hopefully my dinner was better prepared.   For my dinner, I had the enchiladas de mole. They came with sauteed zucchini, which was different than the standard rice and beans you get at other places. The enchiladas were beautiful when they were delivered. The aroma of the mole sauce hinted at their rich flavor. I took my first bite... well.. I guess they were ok. I expect mole to be a dark, spicy (not necessarily hot), never too chocolaty, and a perfect balance of smoke and spice. This took a good run at it but came up short, and I could really taste the chocolate of the mole. The vegetables that they were served with were overcooked and had no flavor to them. I was given a free flan for my birthday which was very nice! The flan was good! It wasn't too jiggly (which Ayesha was fearing) and I believe it might be homemade. Good touch!  Well, I can at least say that I tried Barrio cafe. I would probably go back for their great margaritas and maybe try a different appetizer, maybe after a few more of those strong 'ritas, I'll find out what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Gross. Overpriced and overrated. Just like it's sister Barrio Queen. Just gross."}
{"text":"The place isn't much too look at and in normal times I would of drove by it because a little scary outside! But boy was the server and food beyond AWESOME!! Don't drive by this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food my wife and I had here was very good but I've had better at a few other Mexican restaurants. Felt the dishes my wife and I had could have used more seasoning and a bit pricey for what you get. Our service was adequate but not great.   Saying all that, this place was packed so maybe others feel differently or I have just been fortunate enough to discover a few better Mexican restaurants around the U.S."}
{"text":"Interesting takes on traditional mexican...  An unusual flavor pallet was presented in an unassuming restaurant.  Went on Sunday night - packed - had to wait for 15 minutes.  Had Queso Fundido and tacos.  both were good."}
{"text":"Food is so good and the ambience is one of my favorites! The food is over priced but it's tasty \"fancy\" Mexican food. They try to make it look all nice and they do and it's good but only went couple of times because the price is fine to pay once in a while.."}
{"text":"Omigoodness! SO GOOD.  My husband and I weren't horribly hungry when we got here, but we still managed to disappear a plate of cochinita pibil - and it's a LOT of food.   We got there around 1 on a Saturday afternoon, and the restaurant was half full. Service was prompt, and the food came out quickly. There was lovely live music, and it was just a nice afternoon.   We aren't much for drinking, but the horchata is worth the cost.   LOVE."}
{"text":"Good service, very good guacamole and the fish tacos were tasty. I give them 3 stars only because I found their portions stingy. The shrimp tacos had only one shrimp."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amazes me. I've been here multiple times and even had a birthday dinner there. The service is, at times, questionable. One day they're on point, others they're not. The food makes it alllllll worth it. LOVE THE HOMEMADE GUAC!"}
{"text":"So, I've written a lot of reviews on Mexican food in various places in search of the nostalgia that comes from growing up in California. I went to this restaurant with a coworker that saw it on TV and she raved about the Guacamole that had pomegranate seeds in it and I thought to myself.. \"Here we go, another failed attempt at Mexican food.\"   I was so wrong, I had the guacamole and although the pomegranate seeds were in there this tasted like an authentic dish. So from there I went all in.  I also had the Chiles en Nogad, mainly because I like apricots and was curious about how it was all going to work. I can tell you that was one of best plates I've had. Everyone ordered different foods and no one was disappointed.  The service was fast and most of all pleasant and my coworker earned exponential cool points for picking this restaurant. Chef I salute you!"}
{"text":"Barrio is a not to be missed restaurant. I have lived in the South West for decades. I know and have eaten at many Mexican restaurants. This is my favorite in Phoenix.  We ordered the Coshinita Pibil and the Mango Salad.  Wow! As a side note, Barrio has an incredible amount of Tequila. The restaurant serves wonderful Margaritas."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the 1st time a couple weeks ago after seeing it featured on The food networks Diners, Drive In and Dines.   I happened to be in the area and wanted to try it out. The outside looks great there is murals painted all over the building. When we walked in the place the first thing we noticed was that is was a small little cute place. It doesn't feel too inviting and there isn't much decor.   1st off we arrive and we weren't greeted until a few minutes later. Once we were sat we wait at least 10/15 mins until we are greeted by our server granted it was a busy day. Only half of our table actually received the drinks they ordered and our server took forever to bring us our drinks/apps/ food! The service was sooooo slow not as friendly as I would have expected it to be given that it's been featured on national television and for the over priced food this place has I expected wayyyy better service for the staff!    Okay well now on to the food!!!  For apps we ordered:  -Guacamole: it wasn't the greatest the pomegranate seeds did add a good kick to it but the guacamole overall had no flavor it was missing lime, salt, & pepper and just flavor in general.   -Equites: (Roasted yellow corn with garnishing) this was good it came with spicy mayo cheese and lime.   Entrees:  -Fish tacos: Were really good the fish was fried and had great flavor but nothing out of this world.   -Chilaquiles: they came in a green sauce with an over easy egg on top. I've had way better Chilaquiles else where. These weren't crunchy they were a bit mushy which I didn't like at all and you could somewhat taste the oil in them.   -Chiles en Nogada: my sister ordered this because everyone raved about how great it was, the plate failed to impress us! It wasn't as amazing as everyone said it was. It was all sweet but no savory in it...what ruined the meal for my sister is that as she was eating it she found a produce sticker still on her chile!!! It was such a disappointment and made us all think twice on how unsanitary and careless this place maybe. Given that's they can't even take the time to wash their produce correctly!    - Enchiladas Suzias de pollo: my brother order this and he said they were alright not really worth $20. There was nothing special about them that you can't get at any other place.   -Cochinita Pibil: we all agreed that this was the best meal of all. The meat was pork, the portion of the meat was big and had great flavor. Overall was a very satisfying plate. It did come with side dishes mash and veggies.   As for all the other dishes they weren't anything amazing! This place is just over priced because it's been featured on TV and it falls short of service and flavor! I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place again. There are other places that are 10Xs better for half the price and better service!"}
{"text":"Very good, The service was the only reason it was 4 instead of 5. Now it wasn't horrible but average. The bar mixed a descent drink. But the pomaganite in the guac is great."}
{"text":"Will not be back! food is over priced and to yuppie. the seating is packed in to get as many people that have seen this on TV or read the reviews thinking it's good as they can, it's not. Many more available that offer quality and value, but not this one. Just because they have art work on the outside does not make it good on the inside."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer.  This is NOT 'normal' Mexican food.  If you want tacos, beans, rice, chips and salsa, go elsewhere.  If you want cheap, go elsewhere.  If you want 'authentic' Sonoran Mexican food, go elsewhere.  But...  If you want a very flavorful food experience that has a Mexican 'foundation' in a unique and trendy environment, and you're willing to spend a few extra bucks, I think you would enjoy this place.  OK, that said, here is my [Gringo] review...  Wow.  Went here for a late lunch on a Thursday.  I had the black mole chicken enchiladas.  Others had the seafood enchiladas and enchiladas suizas.  All three dishes were excellent.  We also had the chocolate cake on ice cream with strawberries for dessert.  It was wonderful. I must admit, the table next to us had the churros, which looked even better!   I am a sauce person.  I rate Mexican restaurants by the flavor of the sauces.  On that basis, I can wholeheartedly give the Barrio Cafe 5 stars.  Interestingly, the complimentary starter dish presented was not chips and salsa, but rather bread and tapenade, which was a nice departure.  The tapenade was yummy, although I am also a big fan of fresh chips and house salsa (again, if it has a good flavor and constitution!).    On top of the fine food, the restaurant is decorated wonderfully with El Dia de los Muertos artwork.  Even the restroom is a kick.  Their 'throne room' is a true shrine! LOL.  I loved it!  I  will definitely go back when we are in Phoenix and recommend you give it a try.  I understand it gets quite busy at times, so I can recommend a Thursday at 2:00pm as a great time to stop by for a late lunch and avoid the crowds.  Salud!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on DDD and trust Guy's finds so I stopped in on a work trip for lunch.   You have to park in the back, which is fun as you get to appreciate the festive well done graffiti on the building.   I had a small table to myself and was shortly brought some airy bread with a pimento salsa/marinara that was pretty good although I'm no a huge fan of green olives.  I ordered the pork tacos with side salad, loved the cranberries on the salad as well as the balsamic vinaigrette.  The tacos were super messy, dropping greatness, but so good but what really added to it was a squeeze of lime and the salsa verde. It was a perfect meal that kept me well after my hike three hours later."}
{"text":"Food is superlative.  The guacamole is amazing.  This place has always had imaginative and delicious cuisine.  The only reason it doesn't get a higher rating from me is that when my friend and I dined there, the noise level was so over the top that we couldn't even speak to each other.  I like chatting with my dinner companion, sorry.  So we both vowed only to return in the middle of summer when everyone else was out-of-town or a time when we could sit outdoors."}
{"text":"So, I have heard lots of buzz about Barrio, but for some reason I never stopped in.  My bad!    We went out for a little Christmas eve date night, and were delighted.  We had a short wait before being seated, so we bellied up to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks.  I ordered something with grapefruit soda and juice and I think vodka? Tequila?  Boo!! Whatever it was, it was delicious.  The lady ordered a margarita, which was equally tasty (and strong!).   We started off with a spinach and cheese crepe, which lasted about five seconds. It was that good!  My lady ordered a seafood dish for me (fish, shrimp, little scallops) with grilled zucchini.  Topped with a creamy sauce and chorizo! AHHH! I didn't realize what it was until I bit in and immediately spit it out.  Sorry peeps, I just don't get down with the swine!  The rest of the dish, however, was magnificent!  Succulent little scallops, flaky fish morsels and juicy shrimp! I don't eat animal stuffs that often, but this was definitely worth the backslide.  Overall, we had a great time and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but beware of prices.  La santisima down the street offers a very similar food and drink experience for about a quarter of the price.  Very good though..."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and a friend recommended this place as \"one of the best\" however it's just OK... Not worth the hype.   I got the pescado tacos. They were mini tacos with one thin piece of fried fish with little flavor. Batter wasn't good to me. The size of the tacos were the size of HH tacos I get back home in Seattle for $1. I love fish tacos and cannot resist them when they are on a menu, but these sucked.  My uncle got the suizas enchiladas. He said they were just OK. I tried some of the zucchini side that was in the sauce, but I thought it was decent. A little overcooked zucchini. Overall, just OK."}
{"text":"Good place to stop in on way out for a flight. Garlic omlet is wonderful. Service is usually good."}
{"text":"Delicious food and unique Margarita's beyond compare. Small dining room but big enough to host a small dinner party and still feel you have privacy. Very friendly employees who are willing to go the extra mile to ensure a return visit!   The art work displayed throughout the restaurant is also tasteful and you have the option to purchase. Seeing the local arts showcased makes you start to feel our city does have culture!"}
{"text":"OK, i love the Barrio, but really it is due to there sangria an homemade table side guacamole food is good but i think it is a little pricey for what you get to be honest... it can get loud and hard to hear whom your dining with at times and if you do have to waitI pity you especially right now when it is hot...Go for a late nite sangria or 3!! an some home made guacamole, good for that, ohhh or if your into Tequila they have the BEST selection in town"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here. The drinks are tasty as well. service seems hit or miss and the restaurant is a little cramped but worth putting up with because the food is so good."}
{"text":"The guac. Oh my goodness. Who came up with the idea to put pomegranate seeds in the guac? It was amazing! The little seeds would burst and add an extra dimension to the experience.   The drinks were great - can't exactly remember what I ordered, but just remembered it was delicious (something horchata related?). We were waiting to get seated and decided to grab some drinks at the bar. It was really crowded at the bar area though near dinnertime.  Ordered the fish tacos. It was delicious. We ended the meal with some coffee, which was also pretty good. I was so stuffed that I could not move after the meal."}
{"text":"My friends Heather and Joe and I decided to meet up for dinner on a Wednesday evening, and Heather picked Barrio Cafe. I'd never been there before, and everyone is always telling me how good the food is, so I was quite excited.   Before I even arrived, Heather sent me a text message that I can paraphrase with: The chairs are so uncomfortable, I think I'm going to cry.   I called her and told her we should go somewhere else if she was so uncomfortable (oh, I should mention that Heather is pregnant ... with twins). Just then, Joe walked in and saved the day (dun-dun-da-da!) with a plush towel he happened to have in his car. Ahh ... Heather's tush was now at ease.   When I arrived, Joe and Heather had already decided to get the Queso Fundido: Roasted poblanos, sauteed spinach, mushrooms and melted Oaxacan cheese with queso fresco & chorizo. It was served with chips and bread, and it was delicious.   Joe and I also ordered la Sangria, which is their Sangria made with red wine, mango puree & Jack Daniels. This was also quite yummy - I'd love to try to recreate it at home.  Both Joe and Heather got the Enchiladas de Mole, which the waiter actually hesitated on and warned them that not everyone likes it. Heather and Joe were perplexed ... They like mole ... Apparently some people who like mole don't like the mole at Barrio Cafe ... Flashforward to the end of the meal: Neither Joe or Heather really thought the mole was that great.  I tried something completely different and got the Enchiladas de Hongos, sauteed wild mushroom melange with queso de cabra and aciete de trufa blanca. They pretty much had me at goat cheese (oops, I mean queso de cabra). Complimenting the dish were roasted vegetables that were so sweet .... Mmmm .... the cheese was light and fluffy, and the white corn tortillas were so soft that the enchiladas tasted like a Mexican version of cheese blintzes.   I stopped myself from over-eating (although, it was so good, it took some major effort), and now I have leftovers to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. Yum!"}
{"text":"Tried it out on a whim while visiting Phoenix and was impressed all around. From my margarita and small starter salad ( comes with the tacos and sandwiches) to our entrees. We tried the marinated pork tacos and filet sandwich. The sandwich was out of this world with such great flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and is quiet but tables are so close to each other you could hear other table's conversation. There was a very small quaint bar. The margarita I had was ok. Nothing to travel back for. Considering the serving size the food was overpriced. There were some unique items on the menu. The fundido was delicious although the tortilla chips it came with seemed a bit stale although they were warmed. It was interesting to me that this place had few latino patrons. If they had music on we could not hear it at all. The art work outside this building including surrounding area is great."}
{"text":"Wow! Went to the yard this morning as I do often on Sunday's and actually met Chef Silvana ! I was delighted!! I am a huge fan of hers! She is a true artist in the culinary world. As I read some earlier posts about chef not offering chips and salsa I can't help thinking that those who think this venue is lacking do not get her concept. Barrio is not your \" run of the mill Mexican food \" if you want chips and salsa go to manuals ! As far as pricy think the old saying \" you get what you pay for \" applies."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh so good I can't stop thinking about it. Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh, it was one of those hit-and-miss places. Service was very friendly and hospitable, but it's so loud in here, forget about having any conversation. You end up listening to the loud drunk folks at the neighboring table (who you spend your meal wanting to smack). The pricing is all over the place so you can end up with a good deal or feeling really ripped off depending on what you get. Also, Italian bread instead of tortilla chips = no bueno. Stay away from the enchiladas ... just don't do it. The sauces are horrible so that's the main flavoring the dish. Eww. The tacos were good with their specialty pork and an *ok* price point for $13. Finally, the pescado de la Jamaica was very good and a pretty reasonable price at $25. So it just left us very \"meh.\" Took forever to get our check and get out of the place. Just overrated."}
{"text":"Was waiting for a good opportunity to try this place and so glad I did.  Love the ambiance, a bit small but a lot of cool decor.  Service was great and the food was very fresh and flavorful.  I would definitely be back to try other things on the menu, perhaps dinner.  One critique is that it's a tad expensive given the location and setting, but very fresh ingredients.  No lunch specials so hard to justify spending almost $20 on tacos and a drink."}
{"text":"Man this was such a disappointment seen it on Triple D and and other TV shows and write-ups in the paper was so excited to go here first off the service was horrible it seemed they didn't want me there the attitude the server was very short ask questions about things the menu couldn't really give me an answer I asked another server to bring me water because it was hot outside he said he would get on my server to get it for me because he cannot do that what the hell now the food guacamole was pretty good I like the pomegranate in it and the fact that they make it at the table which is cool I had the chicken mole the sauce was good the chicken was so dry I barely could eat it horrible told the server he told me that's how that's traditionally How It's Made my wife is from Oaxaca I have had many many times it's not made of chicken breast it's made with thighs and legs with bone on but I guess you have to americanize it for people like it what saved the day was their Delicious horchata and the cool Decor of the restaurant but definitely I will never go back here not worth the aggravation and money"}
{"text":"Go for the brilliant graffiti art on the rear exterior, and stay for the churros for dessert. Everything else in between is luke warm mediocre.   It's been a while since we last ate here, and now remember why. Food and drinks are very expensive for what you get. $13 table side guacamole is ridiculous. They used to actually cut open the avocado in front of you, now someone puts a bowl of chopped avocado and the waiter adds toppings and barely mixes. Really? $13 for this?  The $13 margaritas were not that great. More ice than anything.   What I failed to remember up until the first bite was how items were luke warm at best. The squash veggie side was barely warm, as if heated in a microwave. The enchiladas suiza was hotter, but I could tell the ingredients weren't just made. The chicken was dry. Flashback to the two previous visits. My dinner companion's potato side was also barely warm, and the poblano plate was luke warm. Considering you are paying high prices to sit in what once was a store front in a mini mall, it adds a sour and queasy note.   The churro dessert was delicious. I feel that once you order, the service drops off. As the hype built over the years around this place, the owner and management have figured out how to exploit it. After $120, had diner's remorse when leaving.   Suggest going for HH and dessert. Then go somewhere else for the full meal. Sorry Barrio!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was good...not great, but good.  The food was tasty and they seem to use high quality ingredients, but there was just something missing to push it over the top and give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"went to Mi Barrio with friends who wanted real authentic mexican food...Mi Barrio did not disappoint. Excellent food and service, I have to hand it to Chef Silvana the best in town. Keep up the excellent work"}
{"text":"There is good Mexican and then there is Barrio. Don't miss out on their guacamole!!!  And for a true treat for your palate get the Veracruz. Simply the best and most unique flavors I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not good.  This place is not good.  I'll bet it used to be good, but now it is not good.    My girlfriend got the mole chicken enchiladas on the servers recommendation.  The dish was flavorless and the chicken was dry.  I got the Carne Asada tacos, and while edible, they were nothing special.  The artwork is fantastic and the server was accommodating (she removed the enchiladas from the tab and offered to get us something else).  However, I would recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix and you have choose one restaurant, choose Barrio Cafe in Phoenix. Not the one at airport, not the one in Scottsdale. You must eat at the Barrio donde comida hecha en el barrio. It's the best"}
{"text":"Love! Love!!! I had the carne Asada tacos and they were delicious! The meat was moist and cooked very well!! My husband had the fish tacos and really enjoyed them. My favorite was the Esquite!!!! So delicious, I highly recommend it. The place is clean and it has beautiful artwork."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican dish I've ever had. Don't pass up on the opportunity to try it if you're passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"After hearing all of the good buzz we were excited and waited the 45 minutes to be seated. The bar tender was not attentive and appeared to be doing me a favor  The Menu is creative but overpriced.  The staff was attentive but the kitchen was not able to get the food out at the same rate.  The portions are good size but bland ..I had expected my taste buds to light up.   and yes the guacomole was good"}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere & tasty beverages, Your meal starts out with bread & Spanish style tapa vs the usual chips & salsa which is a bonus. We tried the cochinita pibil & camaron tacos. All were very good. I would order both again & again. We had 3 cocktails & they were really good but I gotta say on the small side. I know traditionally speaking you get what you pay for & this was a depth of flavor & profile above & beyond traditional Mexican fare. Having said that you get what you pay for. 2 taco entrees (no sides etc) & 3 cocktails came to $63 at lunch time. So if you go make sure you're prepared with some greenbacks in your pockets because this ain't your nana's house."}
{"text":"This is probably the best \"Mexican\" food I have ever had in Phoenix!!!  I cannot say enough great things about this place.  The guacamole is amazing and they add pomegranate seeds it and its the most fabulous thing in the world!  I am obssessed with their margaritas!  This place is a little pricey but its soooooooooooooo worth it!  Try their enchiladas you cannot go wrong!  The atmosphere is awesome...the outside area is little scary but that is apart of the charm.  Do not forget dessert with the churros for dessert!!!  You will leave this place so satisfied and happy and maybe a little tipsy from the margaritas and tequila shots...lol...go here go here go here!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fun Chicano vibe. Gabriella and Aaron kept the good food and drinks coming. And the bartender Chicago knows a thing or two about tequila. This place is a must for some real good real Mexican food in old school setting with murals everywhere you look."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing. Like many, I found this place on triple D. The atmosphere inside is fun, a great date night spot too! I had the Chiles en Nogada which was incredible. A little bit pricier but you receive the quality you pay for."}
{"text":"I love this Mexican restaurant. I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but this place changed my view completely. Drinks aren't cheap, but tastes great, and have unique selection, you get what you've paid for, I've gotta try their happy hour! Food have great pricy. Weekly Live music and brunch. I live on 14th street and Thomas, so close, I'm so lucky!!"}
{"text":"Immediately when we arrived, we were seated. Dining on solely the guacamole that features pomegranate and the delicious queso fundido, my experience here was about as good as it gets. The horchata in the bottle was also extremely delicious and full of that vanilla and cinnamon flavor. Waiter was kind of a downer but hey, the food totally made up for it. Keep in mind we only had two appetizer dishes so this review may be a little different than others but damn this was a pretty sick place! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Having seen so many yelp reviews and also the feature on Food Network, I had my heart set on the Chiles en Nogada- pepper filled with chicken.  Upon arrival, the parking lot was small but colorful with the graffitis on the walls.  We were seated right away since it was still early and were brought bread with a very excellent salsa (it's got olives in it!).  I ordered the stuffed chicken of course, and the boyfriend had the 12-hour roasted pork.  Despite the good reviews on the tableside avocado, we did not order it as it is really something that can be made at home for 1/10 the price.  For our mains, my pepper stuffed chicken was heavenly with each bite.  The almond slices give everything a nice texture and the pomegranate seeds were a creative compliment.  I literally ate everything except for the stem.  The boyfriend's roast pork taco was very good as well.  The pork had an unusual tangy taste that's not found in your typical pork taco.  The portion was big so we were full just on entrée alone.  The only downside of the evening was that our waiter seemed bored and did not really care about serving us.  Despite the service, I would definitely come back for the chicken if I was ever lucky enough to be in town again."}
{"text":"The food is undeniably good. I ordered their acclaimed pork tacos. I was, honestly, amazed by how large of meat portions they had in the tacos. All ingredients from the tacos and salad, to the chips and guacamole were quality products that tasted fresh. Further, portions, in general, were generous and filling. Still, prices felt a smidge high and service was a little slow, but friendly."}
{"text":"Best gourmet Mexican food EVER. The key word is gourmet. If you want dirty Mexican go to La Toltecta. This is more high-end than is usually expected from tacos.  They also have the best drinks EVER. Check out the drink menu. I recommend pretty much everything on it."}
{"text":"Oh Barrio. How I wanted to love your food. 1 app, 1 entree, 1 margarita = 55.00. The guac was good niice addition  of the Pom. The halibut veracruz was not seasoned well and the side of seasonal veggies was just half cook thick planks of zucchini. I like to try places Guy Fieri visits this was miss for me."}
{"text":"Crazy good food!  Don't let the funky art on the outside spook you; inside is the best Latin cuisine ever!  My husband had seen Barrio's featured on the Food Network.  They have some most unusual entrees.  Don't just go for the usual tacos, although they looked good; ask your servers what they would recommend.  I had a pepper, stuffed with chicken, fruit and nuts, covered with an almond cream sauce and garnished with pomegranate seeds. It sounded weird, but the server suggested it and it was DELICIOUS!  Look for this culinary treasure when your visiting Phenix!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum! Authentic Mexican food that lives up to the name.  We started with the shrimp quesadillas.  They were served opened faced and I was a little annoyed I had to take off the tail, chop up the shrimp, and fold it myself... but I guess that's how fancy quesadillas are? Loved the sauce that came with it.   I had the enchilada suizas and my husband the chocinita pibil tacos.   The enchiladas were sooo cheesy and the chicken tender and chunky.   I thought the dish could have used acid given all the cheese, but I also cleaned my plate so I guess I can't complain. My husband's tacos were delish--not too sweet and the right mount of savory.  The house margarita gave me a run for my money... strong and tasty! Would definitely recommend, but warn that it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"After a miserable experience the night before at Pizzeria Bianco, my wife and I decided to stop into Barrio Cafe and snagged a table about 30 seconds before the dinner crowd arrived.  Best spur of the moment dining decision I've ever made! Having grown up in southern California and living in Arizona I have a special fondness for Mexican cuisine, and I can honestly say Barrio gave me the best example of how you can do modern gourmet cuisine and retain classic Mexican styles.  First off the Quesadilla de langosta borracha made me reconsider what it means to be a quesadilla, and in a good way!  The Chile Relleno was amazing, open faced and covered in amazing cheeses, scallops and shrimp and accompanied by perfectly roasted squash and onions. Heavenly!  To wash that down with a properly made Michelada Picocito was just icing on the cake.  Speaking of cake, try the churros, they basically ruined zoos and fairs for me from now on because no $6 carnival churro will ever compare!  Now I just have to return 10 more times to try everything else on the menu that looked amazingly good! Comida Chingona is right!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the BEST Mexican restaraunts in town. No it's not hot and spicy, that's a different region. This is Central Mexico cuisine at it's best. Their Tequila bar is quite impressive as well. Little pricey, but then you get what you pay for now don't ya?"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever experienced. Arron was our waiter and everything her suggested was great!! I don't know exactly what I ate but my taste buds were in heaven with the combination of foods!!! 5 stars for BARRIO CAFE!"}
{"text":"Went to Barrio cafe on a busy Friday night during the 'chilly' season in Phoenix. We were there to celebrate the remembrance of a family member in an upbeat way.  The food was great, starting with the table side guacamole (do it!). It was really tasty for me, though some people at my table weren't into the while pomegranate seeds. I get it.  My entree was amazing, I had the Chiles en Nogada. Almost anything with that much cream and butter will be amazing, but I savored every last bite and wished for more.  The atmosphere was so-so. Unfortunately they had a band playing that was too loud for the small space, and this on top of a packed restaurant with several guests waiting caused us to be unable to hear each other speak. Hopefully they will keep the live music to less busy nights in the future."}
{"text":"Always a super fan of Barrio Cafe. The decor is very unique, the food awesome and a different style than we typically see in AZ. Think roasted meats, fish and veggies. They do have tacos and enchiladas on the menu, but it's definitely not your run of the mill Mexican food. My favorite is the Cochinita Pibil meal, insanely good roasted pork. they also have killer Sangria!  Expect to spend a bit more than usual on Mexican food, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I took my mom who was in town for my birthday and we had a great time.  Ok, so we are of the Mexican persuasion and we know good Mexican food when we have it and this place is GREAT Mexican food. Pomegranate seeds on guacamole, seriously? Amazing. It was so good the next day was the Super Bowl and even though I live in Glendale I drove the thirty minutes there and back just to get the guacamole for the game. I waited outside for my mom while she ran in and picked it up and they gave her a free tequila shot... not that she needed it. And they brought me out free Flan (fantastic) for my bday.  Tequila bar was on point too."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for a date and this was the choice of restaurant. Nor my wife or myself were pleased. We both come from a long background in Mexican food and this is very overpriced for the quality. Atmosphere is as loud as an elementary school cafeteria, takes forever to get your food or any drinks"}
{"text":"Guacamole is amazing when they put pomegranate on the top. The wait can be horrendous if you show up at rush hour and the hostesses could be better trained. Sometimes we are told it will be a 20 or 45 min wait and it turns out to really be much longer than that. Love the patio. Haven't had a bad dish myself but I have seen tables return food quite often. I only could only hear one complaint one time...they returned the corn dip they ordered cause it was too runny (and it was really watery for my liking) so I stay clear of that appetizer now."}
{"text":"Tried \"Chiles en Nogada\" and the enchiladas suizas last night. The Chiles dish was far more sweet than I ever could have imagined it to be. The enchiladas were quite plain, low on flavor, as they simply had sliced chicken breast inside and melted cheese on top. A  lack luster experience considering the $60 tab (that included one margarita...) We were a bit disappointed. Service was very attentive and friendly. A difficult place to review considering my prior expectations weren't met."}
{"text":"Always have a delicious experience at BC.  I was there last week, had the table-side guac, fish tacos and some sangria.  Loved everything.  My boyfriend knocked over his entire glass of sangria and our server promptly cleaned up the table, changed the linens and brought out a new drink.  Great service, charming atmosphere, amazing food and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Wow, this place blew me away.   First, the atmosphere. Very unique with unbelievable murals outside and has a very quaint feel inside. The food is excellent. Outstanding coffee. There was also live music. A must for anyone in Barrio's Coffee."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and I want to luv this place but I'm not sure why I'm not super into the food. I will continue to support this place because I really appreciate what the owners are doing for the community. The art inside and around the building is super dope and changes often so it's nice to always see something fresh, alive and beautiful in the hood. I luv the bread and olive tapenade that is served before your meal. So tasty! There is a plethora selection of tequila & mezcal. In terms of food I got the Crema de Elota Sopa. It's definitely yummy and made from scratch but it's a tad sweet from the corn and only had one shrimp in it but maybe it's an essence of shrimp. Whatever I luv soup. My friend had the Chili Colorado pork chop which was a big ass pork chop w/some serious sauce w/chipotle mash potatoes and super greasy zucchinis. I've also had the Chilis en Nogada a mixture of yummy chilis, cream sauce and nuts which is a good suggestion because there is a lot of history behind this dish and it's a tasty eat. Either way like I said it's a must eat experience in AZ, don't listen to my review I jus want to be honest."}
{"text":"Always outstanding!  Love the sangria with a splash of Jack Daniels!  Chicken enchiladas suiza (sp) were delectable!  French press coffee along with dessert delight of 'churro rellanos'.... Oh my what an exceptional date night!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and it deserves the recent attention it's getting as one of the best Mexican restaurants in the US.  The wait at lunch during the weekday was approximately 20 minutes, but once we were seated we got our orders in quickly.  For an appetizer, we ordered their queso fundido over their much talked about tableside guacamole, as it was something more unique and not typically found at every Mexican restaurant.  The dish was rich and creamy without being too greasy or heavy.  Highly recommended.  As our main course, we tried their cochinita pibil, pollo en mole, and pollo poblano, and while all these dishes were great (pollo poblano was buttery-melt-in-your-mouth great), the mashed papas and vegetable sides really stole the show at our table, and we wished we'd had gotten more.    The service, however, was less than ideal, as we had to wait a long time to get our waters refilled or for extra sauces. For the most part we felt very ignored and wished we didn't have to constantly try to get the staffs' attention.   Price-wise this place is on the expensive side with an average of around $20 per dish.  Their portions are not small, if that's any consolation, but it is a splurge to eat here.   Overall, great food, average to lackluster service, and a price that may not sit well with everyone's wallet. I would definitely return for special occasions or to show visitors a good, solid restaurant in the area.  (Side: the murals around their building are beautiful and are worth spending a few moments appreciating)"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and was recommended this restaurant. It was AMAZING!! Richard, our server, made excellent recommendations & out of our group of 8 every dish was amazing!!! Highly recommend the churros!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Wow! The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the service. We arrived during the dinner rush and there was only one server in our half of the dinning room. He was obviously overwhelmed. I think if we hadn't come at such a busy time service might have been better."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service, guacamole is some of the best that I have had. The salad is really different but delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We ordered the pork and carne asada tacos for lunch.  We also had the guacamole and everything was fresh and delicious!  The service was excellent too...Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"***had to go back in, the pomegranate guac is delish, tried the Chicken poblano and a friend ordered the Cochinita Pivil I'd recommend! Still amazing! The prices are a bit steep but the food makes up for it !  Love the live music, love the El Mac and other colorful murals outside, had a great time with friends and the Cochinita Pivil was amazing! Juicy shredded bits of pork that are sure to have your taste buds dancing! The neighborhood can be a bit off putting to some but overall the experience was great. It's been a while so I definitely need to make my way back!"}
{"text":"Amazing mexican food, really gave me that home feeling and cultural atmosphere. The enchiladas are delicious and the horchata is refreshing."}
{"text":"What an amazing find in an airport this restaurant is absolutely awesome terrific food highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great authentic south of the border cuisine. Pricey so go for happy hour, half price margaritas,  cheap street tacos, the best crepes in southwest."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in the city, if you are looking for a one of a kind spot, this is it.  There is a great authentic mexican flavor to their food and they have amazing Tequila's that keeps you coming back for more.    The staff are friendly and the service is always remarkable.  I have been going there for years, and I still can't leave without having their Shrimp Tacos  as an appetizer.  Their Filet is a must on your first visit if you like steak and definitely order the Guacamole which is prepared at your table!    Great Sunday Brunch!  The rest I will leave to your experience and I hope you will agree."}
{"text":"Good service, a nice friendly/unique atmosphere, and excellent food, what more could one ask for from a Sunday afternoon brunch??? Not much. This past weekend, the family and I made the trek to downtown Phoenix to try Barrio Cafe and I'm sure glad we did. We arrived promptly when they opened to avoid the crowds, and even though we were so early, the service and food surely hit the mark. It took us a minute or two to actually find the place, but once we did, it's actually hard to miss. Loved the decor and wall art, couldn't have gone better with the food.  As for the food and drinks, everything was delish. We shared the \"famous\" guacamole, which was simple, fresh, and as everyone else on Yelp can attest to, very tasty. For lunch I had the pork tacos... the pork they are known for. It was simple as well, but everything was good... not amazing, but on point. For dessert we all shared the tres leches, which blew me away (though I only got a couple bites).   This small hole in the wall place is serving up some unique, fresh, yummy food and drinks (BTW had a margarita and it was also very good), so you can bet we will venture to downtown again and pop into this spot."}
{"text":"Decent real Mexican food with great Margueritas. Started off with the guacamole and chips which were good noting that I am not a fan of the different Phoenix style heavier chips than the lighter ones that I like. Followed up with a roasted poblano which was excellent and chicken enchiladas suiza which were decent. Service was spotty."}
{"text":"Wow... I was so excited to go here, based on the James Beard recognition and the raves on DDD (big fan of the show). Additionally, I am from the same area in California as the chef. The ambiance was authentic, which I expected. We started with the tableside guacamole, which featured pomegranate. It was tasty, but nothing that couldn't be made at home. I then had the cochinita pibil tacos, one of the featured dishes. It was so over salted it was inedible.  During this, our waiter had started off friendly but then became quite rude with my girlfriend. When he saw that I was not eating my tacos, he became actually snotty. He took them off the bill, but continued to act like we were at fault for questioning the food. When we left, he followed us outside and  tried to act like he was trying to understand our frustration, but merely deflected and talked about how he had 25 years experience in restaurants. He was interrupting my girlfriend when she spoke and acting very condescending. There was obviously a time when this was a great restaurant, but not this time. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience stopping at a random Mexican restaurant in Sonora,TX in our way to Huntington Beach from Houston so we looked up the DDD website and found Barrio Cafe, it has a lot of personality and the food is really good, I had the corn soup, my husband had the fish tacos and we shared the churros which had the best homemade vanilla ice cream ever, we finish everything and left happy."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe and the service here. We sat at the bar and had a wonderful conversation with Nomas, a funny dude who gave us good food choices. The chef's signature dish (forget the name but it's called that on the menu) was delicious and the slow cooked pork (cochinita pibil) tacos were solid. The flaca margaritas are delicious and the Mexican Coke hit the spot (and it was half a liter, a nice change of pace from the usual smaller bottle I see). I also was a big fan of the murals out back. They are definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this wonderful place several times... and I am NEVER disappointed!  I've had the cochinita pibil several times... and always good!  While it IS a small place, it does get crowded when it gets busy, but the food is always good. The drinks always spot - on! I've been a fan of Chef Sylvana's for years now, this will always be my 'take your out of town visitors' place to go to!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great/awesome/fantastic whatever you want to call it.  Quality of the waitstaff, margarita selection, and food selection quality presentation are off the chart! Came here 8 years ago, saw it on Diners/Drive Ins/Dives and couldn't wait to get back on a trip to Phoenix.  The Chiles en Nogada are the most unique flavorful version of a Chile Relleno I have ever had and worth every penny.  A must try in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sadly this is not the same restaurant from a few years ago. We used to absolutely love BC and enjoyed frequenting it during the holidays.  The house margaritas are not the same and weak, the chips that come with the guacamole are different and the posole soup lacked flavor and large chunks of pork like before. The guacamole is no longer made tableside but comes out premade by the kitchen.  You don't get to chose your ingredients like before. The churro tasted like it was not freshly made but was hard and dense. We hear Silvana is chef at Barrio Cafe Gran so perhaps that is the issue.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Authentic flavors! We ordered guacamole, which is prepared tableside- it was delicious! I will admit that the server had a conversation with the patrons at the table next to us (who seemed to be regulars) the entire time he prepared our guacamole which was a bit awkward. I had the Chiles en Nogada which were absolutely delicious. My husband had the Pato en Tamarindo which he thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday around 2 pm and we didnt have any problems with parking (though I can see why one might, at a busier time), nor did we have to wait for service at all. The staff was nice, and prompt. I went with a bunch of foodie friends and they ooh'd and ahh'd over how excellent everything was, and I agreed with them. The guac was tasty (maybe not the best ever, but I'd order it again). I took a bite of the conchita pibil and I was in love with it. All of our food was really great, and we topped it off with the caramel churros (OH MY GOD, go for that alone!) and oh yea, their drinks are friggin excellent."}
{"text":"The table side guac with pomegranate is amazing. I was skeptical for sure. A menu full of food combos that make you wonder, but are so good. The skinny margarita was delicious. Highly recommend checking this place out. The only downside is that we didn't receive very good service. Sat for about 10 minutes before seeing our waiter. Luckily we had our margaritas that we got from the bar while waiting for the table. Never saw him during our meal and had to flag him down for our check. The food more than made up for it, though. Tip - we drove past it twice when looking for it. Not well lit and very unassuming from the outside so keep your eyes peeled when trying to find it."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe's food is very good. The price, however, is ridiculous. I have been making guacamole at home for years with pomegranate seeds, as I loved the previous owner of the barrio restaurants and think she is amazing. I don't like paying for overpriced food, however. The duck I ordered was quite good, and my friend enjoyed her tacos, but both dishes were amazingly overpriced. I don't care if I get a white tablecloth. I also don't care for extremely loud fellow restauranteurs, whom make it difficult for me to talk to my friend. They may have been 15 feet away, which would make one assume I could hear my friend, but that was not the case.  They were also clearly friends with the staff. The food is good, but I won't be back until they knock off the extra price for the white tablecloths which honestly make me feel uncomfortable and until the staff pays attention to actual patrons instead of friends or family. I did not enjoy my time here or feel that I got my money's worth at all. I felt cheated. Chef Asparza knew what she was doing when she was around. I'm not so sure that the current owners or chefs do, though.  The Barrio restaurants are not what they once were. My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of Mexican food, but this was as good as it gets.  The menu is well thought out and prepared with fresh ingredients.  The wait staff was very friendly and prompt.   Great dining experience."}
{"text":"We went to the new location on Grand Avenue (which for some reason isn't in Yelp yet?).  Food was great ... The freshest guacamole I've ever tasted (made to order at your table, no less) ... And the cochinita pibil was fantastic.  Great service too, and nobody rushing you out the door to turn the table.  Named the Best Mexican Restaurant in the US, and well-deserved."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Sunday to try the brunch menu because drinks are tolerated during this occasion.  I'm sure glad we did!  The live music is a very nice touch and the acoustic guitar fills the air.  The highlight of the brunch menu was the Crepa de Chorizo, it has been on my mind ever since.  Also, the bloody Mary was very tasty, so much so, my better half didn't even know it was made with tequila.  We will be back to try the dinner menu, hopefully sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Just ate here and will say it was pretty packed but we got seated in about 5 minutes. But it was packed and probably resulted in the poor and sloppy service we got.  Got drinks at the bar and got seated and got special guac that had pomegranate arils in it. The pomegranate did add a nice splash of tang to the guac, only problem I had was that this tableside guac was 11 bucks and the server just used one of the prep bowls to combine everything; we ended up with a bowl with about two ice cream scoops worth of guac and Im trying not to exaggerate. For eleven bucks I should at least get a bowl bigger than what the onions and cilantro came in.  Next was the queso fundido. At first glance we saw a small pool of water and grease so we decided to mix it thoroughly. The cheeses, onion, chorizo, and seasoning was on point, but half the dish was a watery pool and the other half was a stringy mess like pulling a slice off a good pizza: except this was supposed to be a dip. I was expecting a consistency of nacho cheese, where when you pull the chip off, the cheese falls in ribbons back to the tray, absorbing back into the mothership. My cousin said this might just be what queso fundido is, as we both never had it before. I don't know, you tell me, I honestly think that the cheeses weren't completely incorporated yet when they served it.   I got the cochinita pibil tres tacos. The tortillas didn't taste heated up, and it ended up pretty starchy and grainy with the pork, which was seasoned with nice sour pickled veggies, but no sauce. Should've asked for hot sauce! The fries were okay, not really spicy, but the hot ketchup was good.  My cousin had a filet mignon torta and we first noticed that the bottom bun was soaked in the sauce which was slathered on part of the plate. So soggy bun and decent meat was going to be okkkkk, until we tasted that they didnt reduce the alcohol in the sauce enough and it was a real mismatch with the meat. :/ I'm sure it is a good sauce, had they weren't been so busy and overlooked our table.  I am afraid to say that this socal boy tried to salvedge this meal by making my own dish: carnitas fries with salsa, pickled vegetables, and hot ketchup. I tried. Not sure if I'd go again given the chance, but I will say I'll eat that queso fundido again. Drunk."}
{"text":"So I have been using yelp for a while now so I figured it was finally time to contribute and help others out. This will be my very first review.   I found this website on a foodie's webpage and I yelped it. The reviews were 98% 5 star so I said it was a must visit.   I am visiting my mom and she had never been there either.   Ok so we pull up to the restaurant and had no clue where we were supposed to park so we pulled a U and came back and parked in the slanted parking at the front. My mom said uh are you sure about this place it looks kinda dumpy. I had read on the other website not to let the outside fool me so I said yep and we went in. The look on the inside is completely different than the feel from the outside. Outside you kinda feel like you need to be looking over your shoulder.   We arrived at around 730-8pm last night (Saturday) and were seated right away.   Ordered the guac. Not really sure what the big deal is. And not really sure why it is over 10 bucks. It didn't have that much flavor. To be honest, I was expecting the best guacamole I have ever had for such a price and because of the reviews on here.   The bread and salsa for the table is kinda weird. The bread was excellent, but I don't like olives so I didn't like the salsa.   My mom had a sangria. She didn't like it so she gave it to me. It was kind of bitter, but I put up with it. It didn't have any slices of fruit in it except a little bitty piece of lime. Pretty disappointing for an $11 drink.   I had the pork plate and my mom had the duck. The plates were beautiful. The pork was tender tender tender. It is a flavor I am not used to so it took me a while to adjust. Overall it was good.   The duck had a great taste. She ordered it medium rare, most of it was cooked to order.   We were too stuffed for dessert.   Our server was very nice.   The pros - good experience, lots of menu choices, good food, smells wonderful  The cons - poor parking, you will be a little crowded, $10 guacamole and $11 glass of sangria?? come on are you for real?  Other than that I would definitely go back because I saw some people eating things I wanted to try haha. And now I know not to get the guacamole or sangria."}
{"text":"I love this place!    Everything has a unique taste and after spending eight days in Phoenix, this Barrio Cafe was hands down the best tasting food.  I will admit we did not make it over to the 16th Street location, we did eat at the airport location inside the Southwest Terminal.  After talking with a few locals that were traveling, they all said the food at this location was on par with the 16th Street location.    We had guacamole table side, was not impressed, but I think the girl who was preparing our app was new.  Then we move on to the nachos.....  OMG, these had some sort of cheesy gravy I have never experienced before, I have to admit, I pigged out.  My burrito was out of this world; everything seems fresh and hand-made.  Left completely stuffed and happy.  Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever tried!! The staff is very friendly with excellent service. The Del Mar enchiladas are to die for."}
{"text":"The food was definitely good. The restaurant could definitely be a 5 star but the service was not even close to there. It was pretty bad!!!! It was a 1 star. When we walked in we were ignored for about 10 minutes, THEN somebody came and took us to a table. Once there we were not even given a glass of water for another 15 minutes which made us feel uneasy and off. The server wasn't welcoming at all either. Once the food arrived we did ask for more salsa among other things that never made it to our table, regardless of being told \"yeah I'll bring it right out!\" The poblano chicken torta however was pretty good. The potatoes felt a little bland, but they were still good. The only reason I would give this place a second thought before coming back was because of the service. And I'm a huge believer of service being everything. You can have the best food, but if your customers don't feel welcomed, and enjoy the service they will hesitate on coming back just like I will"}
{"text":"We came to Barrio Cafe during the Great Staycation of 2014... And we did not leave disappointed! Great atmosphere, super staff, superb food! Gabriela, our server, was absolutely spectacular in all she did for us! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here as the reviews were good. Yes, not the typical Mexican food and the place is super cute and authentic feeling.  The downer was our server; maybe he was just having a bad day. I came with my sister for a special birthday lunch. My sister is vegan so she started her order saying she had a few questions as she has a special diet. The waiter shut her down and said \"just tell me what you want\". So she did. Part of her request was rice and beans which they don't serve there, but we didn't know it and he made some snarky comment about if we could find it  on the menu he would pay for our lunch. They served us a large basket of bread, but since neither of us eat bread we asked for tortilla chips. We were told we couldn't have them unless we ordered a side of guacamole. By the end of the lunch we were actually a bit scared of our waiter. Not a great way to spend your birthday lunch. I think this is only the 2nd time in my life I have not given a tip. The restaurant might be good, but we encountered our waiter on a bad day (I have to think something else was going on with him), but made for a really unpleasant birthday lunch. I tried to call the restaurant after to discuss as I felt bad about not leaving a tip, but got sent to a voicemail box which was full. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"So disappointed! the food was horrible!!! Went for brunch and got the chilaquiles while boyfriend got enchiladas. Chilaquiles was Luke warm, dry and definitely reheated left overs!   The sour cream underneath the eggs was dry... Just proving that it was reheated.  The tortilla chips were limp and looked like they had soaked up all of the sauce the day before. It truly looked like left overs... Dry, limp and NOT good. So gross.   The enchiladas were not great either. Super dry and the potatoes had no flavor. Very weird place. Nothing really made sense.   Only giving it two stars because we had a nice waitress. But it was pretty horrible. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"I ate the Tacos de Carne...and they were great.  Any of the negative reviews here were about price and portions.  But my $8.00 tacos (which came with French Fries or Salad) were decently portioned, and the price was fair.  My visit was on a Sunday afternoon, so the ambiance wasn't exactly perfect.  The backdoor entrance was strange...you have to walk through the restaurant to the hostess podium.    But overall, good food."}
{"text":"The food was definitely delicious, heavy but delicious. I ordered the suiza enchiladas and they were very tasty, loved the texture of the corn tortillas. There was an option to add a sprinkle of chorizo on top and I did but I don't really think it made that much of a difference in the taste. The street corn appetizer was delicious and makes me wonder why I don't make that at home! Horchata was good but its pretty similar to other horchatas.  Seems simple enough.  Upon walking in, you would think that it was going to be more casual given the cholo murals on the walls outside but don't be fooled...its a different story inside. Its a little nicer on the inside than the murals on the outside suggest. The food is on the pricier side for Mexican food but plated nicely. Portion sizes are decent."}
{"text":"The location is deceiving, but the food was amazing. This must be on your list of places to eat while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"\"Take care of these guys,\" said the manager to the server as he showed us to our table. \"Extra VIP. They used to be regulars. That means someone scared them away.\"  We did used to be regulars. We spent New Years' Eve - the only day for which they take reservations - at Barrio Cafe several years running, until last year when we decided to stay home. Nobody scared us away; we added a few new places to our list, and my husband's job leaves much less time for dining out than we used to have. We hadn't realized how much time had passed since our last visit.   The place still feels the same, with live music on Sundays and local artists' work on the walls. Since it had been so long, it took us some time to take in the menu changes. Is Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza's signature dish, Chiles en Nogada, really available year-round now?   We started with Barrio Cafe's amazing guacamole. During dinner service, the ingredients are brought out and the guacamole is made fresh at your table. Since this was brunch, it was made fresh in the kitchen. I am not complaining. I have tried to recreate this recipe at home and have so far been unsuccessful. Avocados, lime, cilantro, onion, tomato, and pomegranate seeds, right? Something else, obviously, but I just can't get it right, so I'll have to keep going back to Barrio to eat it there.  I didn't get around to asking about the Chiles en Nogada, because I was craving seafood, and the enchiladas mariscos satisfied that craving admirably. I couldn't tell you what my husband ordered, only that the bite I stole was delicious.   \"Did you leave room for dessert?\" The answer was no, but we were brunching at Barrio Cafe, so we ordered Pastel de Chocolate, chocolate cake filled with imported chocolate, almond and cinnamon sauce, and a pot of their smack-your-momma good dark coffee. I couldn't eat the cake, so I stuck to a few heavenly spoonsful of the ice cream with which it was served. The menu says it's vanilla bean, but I tasted hints of cinnamon even without the sauce.  It was, as always, a fantastic meal. If they'll have us, we intend to reclaim our sports as regulars - starting with this New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star! Save your money and go to Taco Bell, you'll have a better experience! We went for lunch with a large group from work. They sit us next to the bathroom which smells like a sewer, the music was blaring and the service was terrible! The prices are extremely high for lunch prices and the portions are small, and to top it off the food came out barely warm. As we started to get the food delivered to the table sporadically one of my coworkers asked for their check because they were in a hurry and the waiter tells us they won't do separate checks! Yes, after we ordered and started receiving our food. He said the manager refuses to allow them to split the checks and it's not his problem. So much for the customer always being right, and then he racks on a 20% gratuity to the bill that he won't split! Food was awful, small portions, cold and very strange recipes made it hard to order and then the price and terrible service on top of it, Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow....wow!! I saw Barrio Cafe on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and being originally from Phoenix vowed to try this restaurant on my next visit to Phoenix. It exceeded my expectations. Although predictably full when we arrived, the wait was fairly short. In the meantime, we enjoyed the amazing mural art on Calle 16. After being seated, we were greeted by a wonderful server named Jaime. He was very personable and enthusiastic, and made some recommendations for us. I ordered the cochinita tacos. AMAZING. The pork was to die for. My friend had the mole enchiladas. They were also very good, although we decided they could have had more mole sauce on them. A tad dry. But the mole itself was just like what I remember in Mexico. For dessert we had the churros with vanilla bean ice cream. These were no ordinary churros! So soft and delicious.  Overall, I'd say it was one of the best Mexican food experiences I've ever had. And I am a Mexican food snob!  Do not expect your run of the mill Mexican American food here. It is authentic and outstanding!"}
{"text":"Do not let the ratings fool you! This is my first and last time going there. Decided to go because many people hyped it up. Staff was nice and friendly, the horchata is a bit too creamy for me. The Jamaica is good. BUT the food is another story. I ordered enchiladas and boy those were not Mexican style enchiladas. If you're into authentic Mexican food with the right sauces, avoid this place, but if you're looking for gourmet chipotle, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Best fish tacos I have ever had. The margaritas are quite stellar too! We had Esquitas for an appetizer, the only thing that would make it better is if they would sell it by the gallon! We will be back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"This star is only for the server, she was awesome!! But the food is disgusting, for sure not real Mexican food, and 100 dollars for tacos and guacamole and horchata is just crazy prices. Not Worth the Money!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were pretty disappointed.  Had the Esquites which was delicious but would have loved to have some chips to dip, also Kuali de Camaron which was also delicious but they came out separately first the Esquites and when the Kuali de Camaron came out our platters came with it.  I had the Cochinita Pibil, which was cold, my husband had the Pollo en Mole and he said he has had better.  So sorry, Guy, won't be back."}
{"text":"Incredible Mexico City Mexican food (in, you guessed it, the steadily gentrifying barrio) - with absolutely no hint of regional Southwestern or Sonoran flavor, which typifies just about every other Mexican restaurant in town.  A neat non-descript building from the outside, but a wondrous surprise inside.   White tablecloths aside - it's the little touches that strike you:    * The Coca-Cola in old-school glass bottles ala Mexico.  * The Virgin Mary/Guadalaupe tall pillar candles at each table. * Friendly, professional and candid servers. * The french bread and tapenade. * Your tableside made guacamole which is hands down the most innovative and tasty guac I've had in a while.  And I consider myself a guacamole junkie.   I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza, which were flavorful and tender covered in a terrific tomatillo crema.  Great choice, but next time I'm having what my friend ordered - the cochinita pibil.   It's slow roasted for 12 hours every day - and the pork just melts in your mouth.  They have a huge tequila list and a Mexican (who knew?) wine list that ain't bad either.  UPDATE - 1/25/07  The Chiles en Nogada (the poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, garlic, pecans, apples, pomegranate and apricot) blew me away!!"}
{"text":"What a festive little gem this is. The best customer service and everyone seem genuinely happy to be working here. Fish tacos so yummy. Chicken enchiladas are unbelievable. Low rider margaritas very fresh and not all sugary. Music started and we all wanted to dance!  They have the food and overall experience figured out. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have dined here multiple times and each time the food was unique and excellent.  I like the neighborhod feel of the restaurant, even though it means waiting for a table.  I highly recommend the Chiles en Nogada."}
{"text":"Loved the food, service and cozy atmosphere. I ordered duck with a sweet sauce and an horchata to drink. When I tasted the duck I was concerned that its sweetness would drown out that of the horchata or vice versa - but they didn't. Each one had such full flavor that they both stood out throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Such amazing food! Love the guacamole del barrio! I would also recommend the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra, Pastel de Chocolate & Tres Leches desserts. All the food is amazing but if you go on a weekend be ready to wait in line for a table. Totally worth the wait though."}
{"text":"This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local.   You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular.   Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't."}
{"text":"Dank. Every time. Try to get here for happy hour, it really makes a difference. Chef silvana's food creations is like artwork in every bite. Try every one of the tacos, and get the pink guava margarita"}
{"text":"Coming from LA I thought this place was an awesome cafe, the food was excellent and the service was just as good as it can get!! I'll no doubt will be back on my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We know this was a bit more expensive, so we came here before the ballet. I had the special, which was halibut covered with roma tomatoes, capers, olives, (and probably other things that I can't remember now), and sat on a bed of mashed potatoes. Truly one of the most memorable dishes I've ever had.   My wife had something more tortilla-based, and loved it. Oh, and I can't forget about the chipotle chese dip. Usually something like that would play heck with our digestive system (getting old sucks). However, this stuff was amazing, easy on the belly, and we couldn't stop eating it.  The margaritas were a bit weak. And probably too expensive. Oh, and the table-side quacamole looked awesome. Pomegranite in it? The table next to us ordered it, and made us very jealous.  I am definitely looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I met a group of friends for dinner here and it was a nice dinner.  I didn't break down in bliss because it was the best Mexican food I've ever had nor did angels and cherubs appear.  It was a nice dinner.  The whole waiting situation, to be honest, is annoying.  If the bar area was larger perhaps it wouldn't be or if they took reservations but I hate waiting.  It was only because I like my friends so much that I could do it.  (It was all for you ladies....because I love you. ;))   The wine selection is ok, the tequila selection is incredible.   Our server was very friendly and attentive and all of our dishes were delivered quite quickly to our table.  The tableside made guacamole was ok...to be honest, my husband makes a better guac.  I think it may have been that the avocados were not ripe yet because it was very chunky.  The queso was good, not nearly as good as the queso at El Encanto.   I chose the enchiladas suizas which was very very rich; to the point where it was too  rich.  Much to my dismay there was little chicken and a whole lot of cheese.  I left half a plate of cheese behind when I was done. I did think it was pretty reasonably priced however, we each paid about $35 for our entree, a drink, and the appetizers.    They had live music playing which would normally be a nice touch but we were seated directly next to it and it was very distracting.  I could barely hear my friends over it.  Given the small size of the restaurant and the atmosphere I think the music would be much better acoustic.    I am sure that during my years living in Phoenix I will return here at some point but I don't know how soon it will be.  I would like to take my husband at some point, if for nothing else the tequila selection, but I don't think it would be at the top of the list."}
{"text":"I love this place! I didn't realize it was rated one of the best Mexican restaurants in town until we had eaten there. Now I know why. Fish is always great and the organic margaritas are so good. The shrimp tostadas and corn appetizer are amazing. Lively and cute bartender, friendly hostess, great servers and good food make this our family favorite. Wish it wasn't so far away from home!"}
{"text":"If you like modern mexican cuisine, you'll get it here.  It's a quaint little restaurant with a lot of character on the inside.  However, sometimes the wait can be extremely long in which case the only place to hang out while you're waiting is the microscopically small bar area or outside the restaurant (in which case you'll have a not so great view of a not so pretty street).  Big with the downtown hipster set."}
{"text":"This was our first time to eat here. We had heard how great it was and every time we call to find out how long the wait is it's usually like two hours. We arrived around 430 and there was no wait at all! It was my birthday and they gave us a complementary flan which was excellent! Very dense and Rich. We ordered the guacamole and it was so fresh and delicious. The chips were also fresh. I like that they serve a complementary olive tapenade with bread instead of your typical chips and salsa.  My husband had Suizas enchiladas with chorizo, and I had the chiles en Nogada stuffed pepper.  Both were very good! The chiles en Nogada was very flavorful and had both sweet and savory flavors.  and came with chipotle Mashed potatoes that had a nice kick to them and grilled vegetables.  Our server was great!"}
{"text":"Best (upscale) Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great!  We were wondering where in the heck we were when we saw the hole-in-the-wall.  The first thing I loved was the artwork in the back entrance.  All of our food was great and they gave us good recommendations for the kids.  The margaritas were tasty and STRONG.  This is a must do in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The area is a little sketchy but the restaurant is very nice, they have a great selection of tequila and margaritas. The food is decent but what I liked most is that when you order the guacamole a guy comes out and makes it from scratch in front of you.   I would go back.."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of any kind in Phoenix. Cochinita pibil in platter and sandwich form is very memorable. Chiles en nogada too. Amazing guacamole, delicious tapenade for your bread, but be sure to save room. The posole verde soup is another home run. Honestly, I read the negative reviews of this place and could not understand how this was possible. Innovative, satisfying, absolutely top notch cooking and service. The criticisms of others strike me as bizarre. If you like fine dining and you like Mexican, Barrio is an incredible find."}
{"text":"Very authentic, and extremely cozy.  I recently found this gem randomly while looking for great Mexican restaurants.  It's now easily in my top 3. I had a delicious seafood dish called Del Mar.  It was a mixture of shrimp, scallops and crab.  Then they added white wine and cream sauce with chorizo sausage.  It was topped with roasted poblano peppers and onions which gave it a nice spicy finish.  I will be telling many friends about this place."}
{"text":"This is literally the best meal i have ever had (no exaggeration). I got a lobster tail with a filet on the side (amazing, the lobster had a tequila sauce). They make guacamole right next to the table. The place manages to do authentic Mexican food in a classy way; most places can only do one or the other well. The margaritas are delicious. Also we brought a family of 8 and they sat us (the place is small so it took a while) but everyone agreed, hands down the best food we've ever eaten. Every time i go back i love it. Way better food than taco guild or other pretenders out there! Im almost sorry to give them such a good review because they may get too busy!"}
{"text":"seen this cafe on my way from work for 9 yrs never stopped,  well this is what I think, it was very small, no where to stand and wait to be seated, once we got seated there was hardly any room to move and the waitress kept bumping into us, it was awful and uncomfortable,  order an arizona burrito dinner and some type of dinner salad that was not worth 12.00. Then 12.00 for guacamole? Just to cut and chop and mix salt,tomatoes,cilantro and lime? 12.00? No way no how, menu is expensive and over rated and very small portions. Would never go back.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"Always love this place everything is great, Fresh guacamole interesting dishes the bathroom sucks but still an awesome place to eat and drink"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my meal. I'd been here twice before and was impressed each time. This time, not so much. They have excellent guacamole (although anyone can mix some pomegranate in, right?), but the rest was insulting.  My entree (chile en nogada) came out on a very hot plate, yet the chile itself, while charred, was not warm at all. The chicken in the filling was warm, but not anything else. The zucchini side was mushy, and the potatoes that came with it were clearly nuked on the same plate as the zucchini.  I told the server my concerns, and a new plate of everything was quickly brought over in no more than two minutes. Again, parts of the entree and the side were not thoroughly heated, yet overly heated in other parts. The manager asked how things were, and I let him know I thought even this was microwaved. While he might have brushed the accusation aside, he did not emphatically deny it.  My dining partner's meal, chicken mole, was equally disappointing. Three (three?!?) chicken breasts that were clearly cooked hours before and reheated, with some mole tossed on at the last minute. The tips were rubbery and the thicker portions of the breasts were not warm to the touch.  When our waiter came back to ask how the second attempt was, I complained again that it seemed microwaved and he simply said \"Sir, I'm not sure why you're so mad, but have a good night. Goodbye.\"  We left without further discussion."}
{"text":"You will have to wait to get in but worth it. Very diverse set of clientele which speaks to the quality of food. Margaritas use quality ingredients with good flavor. Guacamole made table side with you-pick ingredients. All fresh. Only tried the pescado (fish) del mar. Excellent Flavor and prepared perfectly. It took a while to get the entrée but I can only imagine the kitchen is small. My only knock. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed it. Of course we had to wait, but it was worth it. Our drinks were delicious. The frozen guava margarita was very refreshing on a hot summer evening. Also the bomba was tasty and strong.  the bread and olive spread is different, I love olives so I loved it. The guac is pretty much what it's cracked up to be. A bit too chunky for my liking, but no big.   I ordered the pollo poblano and it was delicious.. that sauce was amazing. The babe got the pork tacos. I only got one little baby bite, so you know they must have been tasty.  They also had a duo playing music, so that was cool."}
{"text":"Mediocre  at best for food, service was absolutely atrocious!  Will not go back.  Don't get the James Beard nomination, it was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected! Excellent meal and service, restaurant gives you the Feeling of sitting in Mexico City!   The prices are decent not expensive at all. The fish I had was 16.75 maybe a little pricey but well worth the visit. It's def a must if your wanting authentic Mexican food with a cool twist"}
{"text":"So delicious! Been to Barrio Cafe a few times and it is always good. Great guacamole! I love it with the pomegranate seeds! Dinner it is made table side. Friendly and helpful staff. Sunday brunch is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with a couple friends for lunch on a Sunday. Had a good experience, friendly service and our waiter made several recommendations. The live music was a bonus! I  agree with other reviews on price point; however, this is not traditional Mexican food so perhaps in that viewpoint, pricing is expected? We didn't order off the Sunday brunch menu which looked to be more affordable, but everything we did order was delicious:   Libations: The Bloody Mary was so good, not too overpowering or spicy.  The glass was rimmed with salt and what looked/tasted like sugar and crushed red pepper, not spicy at all, a nice touch.  I also tried a Michelada for the first time, another good choice! Would like to try happy hour (drinks are half off) on another visit.  Starters: The complimentary bread basket with Olive Tapenade set the tone for a non-traditional Mexican meal. But we also ordered an appetizer, the Kuali de Cameron which was my favorite. Think fancy shrimp tostadas...a large shrimp atop a roasted jalapeño dressed with a couple of different cheeses and seasoned very well! Would like to try the guacamole raved by other yelpers next time for sure!  Main event: We ordered a couple dishes for sharing, the Tacos Cochinita Pibil (pulled pork) was very tasty; the meat was juicy and flavorful. The enchiladas suizas was traditional with the exception of chorizo crumbled on top, otherwise not really too exciting for my palate.   Grand finale: After little debate and then a vote, we decided to go with the Flan for dessert. The flan itself was okay; however, the candied pecans and the fresh-cut strawberries on the side with Khalua cream and caramel heavily drizzled on top added more character to this dessert. There was also another distinct taste like goat cheese and when we asked the waiter he mentioned its cajetas (goat milk in the caramel sauce), all flavors blended nicely together to end a good meal :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best, most unique, and freshest Mexican food I've ever had. If you've been to any of the Barrio restaurants you'll know there is hype behind the name... Well I've been to the one in old Scottsdale and in Gilbert and neither live up to he hype of the original, which after eating at today I will go nowhere else for median food. The guacamole is fresh and he perfect combo of ingredients, again in a league of its own compared to the other restaurants around the valley linked to Barrio.  I ordered the Chiles en nogada as that's the signature item and the dish made on DDD. Is didn't disappoint and I will definitely order again.  It was also happy hour here on a Saturday with half off drinks and buck-fifty tacos. The tacos alone are worth coming for.   They don't have beans, rice, or flour tortillas... So if you're looking for cheap filler foods go somewhere else.  This place was amazing."}
{"text":"Oh yum yum!  I've enjoyed brunch, lunch & dinner at the original Barrio Cafe on 16th St.  The menu doesn't offer the usual food you might expect at a Mexican restaurant, it's a regional cuisine with Chef Silvana's special twist.  I haven't been disappointed yet & this review is making me hungry!  Brunch is my favorite meal, & the brunch menu is outstanding.  I highly recommend the Barrio Cafe.  There are 2 other locations, one at the airport & the other is on Grand Ave"}
{"text":"Heard great things and came here and it definitely did not disappoint. The guacamole was delicious- love the pomegranate seeds. I don't remember the name, but I had the chili pepper that's stuffed with chicken and seasonal fruit. This was one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten. Not too spicy- perfect. Wife loved it too. They were out of the pork so we weren't able to get that but my wife had enchiladas and really liked those as well. The drinks were excellent!  I only knock off because it is pricy for what you get but I would definitely come back...and get my meal again.  Also, the art outside is awesome."}
{"text":"Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!"}
{"text":"First experience here... The food is pricey, but worth every penny! It tastes soooo fresh and authentic. Plus, I Love the artwork that the building displays! I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place first caught my eye driving down the street. The name definitely talked me into going in. Once I walked in, I felt right back at home. Everyone was so nice to us and the food was A1! I had the cochinita pibil tacos and I didn't want to stop! I wanted more!!! By far the best tacos I've had in a long time and don't forget to check out the bathroom. The decor is deferent to say the least lol"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I had the cochinita pibil, a 12 hour roasted pork dish.  The pork was juicy and awesome.  I don't even really like pork that much but this dish really stood out on the menu.  I'm from LA so I'm used to decent Mexican food.  But I moved up to Seattle last year where there is absolutely no good Mexican food.  So as soon as I came down to Phoenix, I rented a car at the airport and drove straight here.  The neighborhood is a little dodgy but not too bad.  There is a small parking lot in the back.  The murals in the parking lot are a little scary looking and the painting inside the restaurant are a bit scary as well but the food was great.  They had live music playing loudly.  It made for a nice and festive atmosphere.  They open until 10:30pm on Fridays and I got there at around 9:45pm.  We ordered and finished eating at around 10:30.  There were only 2 other tables around when we left.  In addition to the pork, the tacos de carne asada were great and the enchilada de mar was also very good.  The table guacamole is a bit gimmicky but was good nonetheless.  They put pomegranate in guac which isn't typical but tasty.  The margaritas were good.  We had the lowrider margarita and it was good with a lot of tequila!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  They take the best Mexican food dishes, then add delicious little savory twists in on their version of the classics!  What you get is an amazing and unforgettable meal experience!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the guacamole even though it is way overpriced.  For $11.25 you get maybe two avocados fixed table side. Everything is very flavorful and I'm sure you will like anything you get. This is gourmet Mexican food not your typical beans and rice joint."}
{"text":"It has taken me way too long, as in forever, to finally dine at Barrio Cafe.  Our lunch visit with another couple yesterday (Saturday 1:00 for reference) was outstanding.  Service was impeccable, staff 100% friendly, decor intriguing both inside and out, and most importantly, THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE.  This is not your average Mexican-food joint.  Menu is really unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Everything on the table, from the guac to the esquites to the pork to the salad to the mole...supremely satisfying and even better, exciting.    My only regret?  Seeing Chef Silvana hanging out there as we were leaving, and me acting like a starstruck tongue-tied nerd, trying to express myself in front of this talented Phoenix culinary rock-star celebrity.  She and all of her locations and creations are a Phoenix Point of Pride.  Just wish I could have expressed myself better to her face...  Run, don't walk, to Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!  I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it on DDD.  It definitely met all of our expectations!  We came on Mothers Day after seeing the Frida exhibit at the Heard museum.  I thought the wait would be long, we were told it would be 20 minutes, but we only waited for less than 10.  Maybe because we were here at about 2:00 in the afternoon.  The art outside and all along this street was inspired by the chef to build a sense of community.  It's bright and ethnic, and beautiful!  We started with Barrio Guacamole - it was so different than any guac we've had before - I LOVED the pops of pomegranate!  My only disappointment was that it was wasn't served tableside as the menu had promised.  The bread and olive tapenade were a nice and different touch - we loved it!  My husband had the enchiladas suiza - spicy,juicy, delicious!  I had the chili's en nogada - the flavor combo's in this were out of this world!  I literally closed my eyes and was swept away to ancient  Puebla where this is from. The chili, and fruits (apricot, apples, pears) and nuts melded with the crema, the almonds, and the pomegranate and cilantro garnish.  WOW!!!  I couldn't stop eating the side of chipotle mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked calabasitas. Now that we're home I wish we had tried one of the deserts... I loved how the jicama came in a coke bottle, and the art on the walls inside.  Our service was excellent!  There was also a nice guitar player playing music to add to the ambiance. Very cool place, I hope I to have the opportunity to go again when in the Phoenix area!!  If you're anywhere near - GO!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this resto long time ago, but haven't been back since...for what reason I don't remember.  Well I'm so happy I came back!  Now I'm just learning of the history of this place.  Chef Silvana Esparza has won numerous awards and has been nominated for James Beard many times.  Her restaurant has been acclaimed as the \"Best Mexican\" in AZ for many years since opening by not only local mags, but publications such as NY Times and Epicurean!  She was raised in a family whose ancestors were once appointed the official pastry chefs to Spain's royal family!  Then Esparza family emigrated to Mexico in the 1600's where they continued to practice their trade for generations.  This restaurant has been here since 2002 and there's a sister resto called Barrio Queen where I haven't been yet.  After my experience at this resto, I'll def go and try it next time!  What I had: Horchata Homemade horchata served in recycled Coke bottle!  Interesting presentation, but it was absolutely delicious!  It was one of those huge Coke bottles too, so I got like 3 glasses out of one bottle!    Salad A side salad that comes with lunch order.  The BEST side salad I've ever had!  Mixed organic greens, chopped tomato, raisin, and chopped hard boiled egg whites.  Tangy dressing.  Size was pretty big for a side salad too!    Guacamole del Barrio An award winning guacamole.  The you'll see a theme of pomegranate everywhere!  That's because they believe in using ingredients that are available now in season.  Note that this was about two weeks ago that I was here, so they might not have this particular version of guacamole anymore when you get there, but this was absolutely delicious!  It was more like an avocado salad rather than a guacamole that I'm used to that are more mashed and mixed up, but it tasted so good!  Needed more salt so I added some salt & pepper at the table and it was scrumptious with their house made chips!!  Chips They look thick and chunky, but oh boy!  Wait till you taste it!  Light, airy, and crispy!  One of the best tortilla chips ever!  Bread and Tapanade Tapanade at Mexican resto?  Wow!  That was a surprise and it was a pleasant one at that!  At first I thought it was their salsa, and I was thinking to myself, why are they serving with baguette??  Well it turned out to be tapanade made with olives, roasted peppers, and other tasty goodness!    Chiles en Nogada This Chef Silvana's Iconic Dish us a roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, apple, pear, dried apriocot and pecans, in a delicate almond cream sauce.  Finished with the colors of the flag: cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds.  I'm not into sweet entrees, but this dish was excellent!  Flavors worked very well together and it was refreshing to try something entirely different.  If you're used to just a staple Mexican like carne asada burrito and enchiladas, you're in for a treat!  Cochinita Pibil Barrio's acclaimed pork is marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted over night.  Topped with pickled red onion and Yucatan-style pico de gallo.  Flavors were spot on!  Veggie Side Dish Creamy mashed papas and vegetables del Barrio.  Sooooo good!  Veggies so good that even Critsy will finish!  Zucchinis were so sweet and tender and the papas (Mexican mashed potatoes) were so creamy and yummy with a slight kick!  Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra Their famous churros filled with goat's milk caramel, served with vanilla bean ice cream, and topped with more caramel and candied pecans.  This was really delicious!  I also know that sometimes hot and cold dessert are match made in heaven!  With that said, for this particular dessert, it would've been a 10 out of 10 rather than this 9 out of 10 had they skipped the ice cream and served more caramel sauce or chocolate dip on the side.  The churros were perfect fluffy, chewy, and crispy, but it would've really brought out the flavor with a hot choc dip on the side rather than the way it was presented.  Again, it was still very good!  I might be just super picky.  :)  Next time I'm going back for their flan.  It looked AMAZING and I kept hearing the other table moan with foodgasm!  :D"}
{"text":"I just stopped in here for a beer in between my flight. It was crowded, as some airport restaurants can be. Prices were fair, the food didn't seem too appealing to be honest. I'm giving it two stars mainly for the mildly racist caricatures drawn all over the menus. They also spelled 'Ensenada' wrong. SMH. Only in Pheonix."}
{"text":"The food is inspired and delicious and it has a terrific female chef-owner. I caught Barrio Cafe on an episode of FoodTV's Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and they sampled my favorite dish the poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, apricots, apples, shallots and pomegranite seeds - so tasty. Definitely a jewel in Phoenix's crown."}
{"text":"Silvana get in here quick!  They are ruining your spot!  This visit to Barrio Cafe (one of our favorite places) reminded me of what happened when De La Hoya started singing.  His boxing career went to shit.    My wife and I have been a fan of Barrio for a long long time.  We've been back many times over the years and have had for the most part an exceptional meal and service.  This time was an absolute disaster.    The place was half full on a Saturday evening.  We were standing in the bar area waiting for our table.  I asked the bartender for a drink and he was very rude and barely even turned around to acknowledge me.  As I was answering his rudely asked question the waitress came to let us know the table was ready and to come over when we tab out.  The bartender rudely responded for me and said I hadn't ordered nothing.  I did in fact order but you were too unhelpful to make it or turn around and now you are answering for me.    We sit down and place our drink orders again.  We also let the waitress know we were ready to order.  Instead of taking our order our waitress goes and gets drinks.  No big deal.  We wait and wait for the rude bartender to make our drinks.  They finally come and we put in our order.  Now the real wait begins...We waited so long for our food I went to get up and leave but my wife was so hungry she wouldn't let me.  I literally said 5 more minutes and we are out of here.  The food came with 2 minutes left on my phone.  There was no apology from the waitress.  No asking for additional drinks during the wait.  Nothing.  Mind you the place was half empty on a Saturday evening.  Now we know why.  We ordered two enchilada suizas.  They were nothing like what they have been like for the past years.  They were COVERED in cheese.  I'd guess about a pound of cheese was on my plate.  The onions were cut 3/4 inch thick and the zucchini was even thicker.  Yum...HUGE pieces of red onions.  Just what everyone wants to wait an hour for.  The enchiladas were dry and needed sauce and the chicken was extremely dry and overcooked.  I was so pissed I just wanted to leave.  But of course I stay so my wife can order our favorite dessert the churros.  Once again we wait forever.  I'm thinking good Lord forget these damn churros.  They come out and they are really good as always.  After we were done the waitress never came back.  I saw her walk past us after the dessert and go into the little nook in the back so I knew she was back there but she was either playing hide and seek or she took a little nap.    As we wait I see the manager on duty with the busser who has been here forever talking and almost looking like they were congratulating each other on another night well done.  As my wife and I continue to wait forever for our waitress to come back from the grave they didn't even have the decency to ask us if we needed anything or find our waitress.  Yeah, you guys are killing it.  Killing the business.  20 minutes later the waitress comes out.  I signal for the check.  Again, no apologies, no sorry for the wait.  No sorry we suck tonight.  Nothing.    Our bill was just under a 100 bucks for two drinks, two meals, and a dessert.  Normally I wouldn't think twice about the cost but this time I won't forget it.  Best of luck Chef Esparza.  I'm not sure if we just had a terrible experience, or you have too many ventures going on or what but the staff you trusted to take care of this place are just letting your amazing restaurant fall to pieces.  Either way, we wish you the best but due to the food quality and lack of service and respect we will never be back."}
{"text":"My God, this is the most delicious Mexican food ever!  Talk about authentic!  Started the evening off with a Michelada...delicious!  Had the tableside guacamole with those pomegranate seeds.  Wow!  Amazing combination of ingredients!  For dinner, I ordered the Enchiladas en Mole and my partner had the Chiles en Nogada.  Let me say, both were unbelivably delish.  Ended the evening with an order of the Churros Rellenos d Cajeta...another heavenly dish that did not disappoint!  -  What a great night, perfect service and very cool decor!  We'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe has a \"barrio\" feel to it with a not so \"barrio\" price tag.  But if we speak about food taste... out of the 5 times I've ordered the Cochinita Pibil, 4 times it was amazing... one time it was very salty. However, overall Barrio Cafe offers a unique and delicious take on authentic Mexican food. The guacamole is truly very good and it's nice when they mix it in front of you and the whole show... however when you're actually eating it you say to yourself \"I can make this guac at home for one fifth of what I just paid for it\".  This place is nice for a date or for anyone looking for a cozy atmosphere, especially at night. Like I said at the beginning... I feel the food is a bit over-priced but if you want to try mexican food with a more elegant twist, then this is your place.  P.S.- The bread with the Italian mixture of ingredients they bring at the beginning is not good. I don't understand why they just don't serve Mexican salsa instead of something that tastes like something you put inside of a Philly Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"We picked this place out of nowhere-- no, that's a lie, it's Zagat-rated. The food here is very tasty and you can tell the freshness with each bite. The portions are not overly large, but the flavour makes up for things. I had the pork tacos and the guacamole. The guac was very fresh and served chunky. We had some churros to end of and they were definitely worth it! Very large, crispy and served with vanilla ice cream. The service was prompt, although the food took awhile. It's a very unique spot with beautiful (and haunting) murals painted inside and out of the building."}
{"text":"After lots of hype, I decided that I needed to see what all of the fuss was about with Barrio Cafe, so I enlisted a friend of mine (and a Barrio fan) to go with me last night. On the way there, I was issued a few warnings about this place: it's in kind of a sketch neighborhood, and the wait might be a little long as its often packed out. So I thought it was a good sign when I got there and had the thought \"hmm, well, it looks better than south central L.A.\", and there wasn't any wait at all! Granted, it was a Tuesday night, but yaaah for us! It turned out to be a good start to a great dinner.  I started with the frozen mango margarita, which was pretty darn tasty (which for me means not real alcoholic). For appetizers, my friend and I went with the Guacamole  Casero, which was crazy cool cause they make it right in front of you, and the Quesadilla de Langosta Borracha, which is garlic & tequila lobster served on a corn tortilla with melted Oaxacan cheese and queso de cabra. The guac wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was also NOT the worst, so...you take what you can get sometimes. As for the lobster quesadillas, they were pretty darn great, and I don't even like lobster that much! We easily polished them off.  For our entrees, I ordered the Cochinta Pibil, which I would recommend to anyone. It's pork that's been slow roasted for 12 hours with achiote rojo & sour orange with salsa Yucateca...and is apparently how you say \"yum\" in Spanish cuisine. The pork was so tender and flavorful, and came with little tortillas and veggies to make your own tacos...it was so good that, even if I went again, I'd seriously consider getting it again, despite the fact that my friend rattled off at least 5 other dishes that she said were equally as delicious. I don't know, it'd be a tough call. I also tried my friend's chicken enchiladas, which were good, but which I personally thought didn't hold a candle to the tastiness of my pork.   For dessert, we went all-out with the churros, and I can honestly and without any hesitation say that I've never had a churro that delicious in my life. NEVER. Nor will I probably ever again...unless I go back to Barrio. Seriously, these things were STUFFED with caramel. I didn't actually realize that when I bit into it, and was JUST delighted...like a little kid on Christmas; it's GEEEEENIOUS! O man, I could have eaten those things all night...but alas, all good things must come to an end, and so I will savor my Barrio experience rapturously until I get the chance to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. Start out with the bread and tomato/olive tapenade. Than we ordered the guacamole...I could not stop eating it. Loved the addition of pomegranate seeds in it. It brighten it up so much.  Hubby had the posole soup. He really enjoyed it. I got the del mar enchiladas. Omg they were so good! The vegetables of onions, corn and zucchini wish I could have eaten it all. Saw this little Gem on food network \"the best thing I ever...\" And decided we needed to stop while traveling thru. So VERY glad we did! If I ever get to Phoenix I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Gourmet Expensive made by a Latino chef who knows what she's doing and where she comes from place in Phoenix hands down! From the guacamole and chips, to their enchiladas and my personal favorite, the cochinita pibil, Barrio Cafe is a true gem to be experienced and enjoyed.   I have spent two birthdays there and it always makes me feel as though I have been transported back to Mexico. Better yet, they even have Coca-Cola from Mexico in a bottle, THE BEST! This actually makes them look more down to earth and humble compared to other wannabe upscale Mexican food places. Needless to say, I am such a fan that I purchased one of their t-shirts that say COMIDA CHINGONA, because it really is BADASS FOOD."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Tex Mex with a flair. Not cheap by any means (about $35-$40 a person) but well worth it.  This place has great food, fast service and a unique palate."}
{"text":"Tacos aren't even average.  They are not trying.  Place was in disarray and staff seemed checked out."}
{"text":"Table side guacamole with pomegranate is amazingly different. Everything from the margaritas to the pollo en mole is fantastic. Waite staff was warm and friendly and made good food suggestions. Will visit again next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Any meal at Barrio Café is a treat. Just driving by the building is an eyeful of what has to be the best artwork covered building in Phoenix. Every inch of the endless mural deserves to be observed, studied and remembered. Feel it people. If you go in through the back door, where the parking lot brings you, you enter a portal that takes you to a neighborhood place, where everything and everyone is familiar. You've been here before. It's like coming home. Only better, because you don't have to cook. I don't care what you order, it's good. It's better than good. It's the exact way it should be.  From the tapenade and bread to the pomegranate guacamole all the way to the crepes de cajeta, everything was perfect.  We ordered a side of spicy steak fries because they made a nice share plate and they're great with the spicy ketchup. And I love french fries.  For my main dish, I had the Enchiladas del Mar. It turned out to be a little too much cheese for me, but the rest of my family loved it. (Me & dairy... eh) But it had the right amount of flavor and sea food to balance out the cheese. And it came with the perfect side - sauteed vegetables. A nice combination. So in the fairness of sharing, I had a Carne Asada taco. The tortilla was just crispy enough to not be floppy and it held the grilled steak the way a tortilla should. Until I was done eating it. Since it was happy hour I indulged in a Barrio Bomba Margarita and was delighted at how pretty (and how big) it was. I know it was mostly juice in that tumbler, but how could I go wrong with pineapple, orange, and lime juice? Especially when they're half off. Something to check out, and it doesn't have to do with food: The peep-holes in the back doors. On the outside they're prisms and on the inside, they're just cool. And look out for the iguana in the restroom!"}
{"text":"Horrible food.  We went at lunch time on Saturday and hardly anyone there.  Maybe 4 other tables.  The table next to us complained that the food was bad.  Should have been a warning.  We got out luke warm food and sure enough, absolutely no glovor or taste to it.   The best part was 6 hours later when we both had explosive diahrea.  What joy.   Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I lived in Phoenix for 15 years and now that I live in PA, I make sure I visit this restaurant every time I go back.   To me, this restaurant shows off exactly what southwest food is capable of. Crappy Americanized Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in Arizona (and disaster zones serving microwaved inedible food in PA), but this place offers an innovative, modern take on southern Mexican cuisine. They use fresh, unique, high-quality ingredients.  It's almost an art.  I particularly enjoy the enchiladas de hongos, which features wild mushrooms, white truffle oil and a strong goat cheese. The taste is strong and unlike anything I've ever had before. It lingers in my mind (and most likely breath) for days afterward.   The drinks feature fresh juices. Really, you shouldn't accept them any other way, in my opinion, but margaritas around me in PA are syrupy concoctions of artificial flavors and sweeteners. Gag.  The atmosphere is modern southwest-themed, with bold art on the walls and laid-back, yet attentive servers. I could go just to check out the featured artists.  Go! Right now!"}
{"text":"The wait was really long and I thought the food was just average. Maybe I just didn't order the right items from the menu but I tried my moms dish and didn't care for it as well either. Worth it to try the hype but not to come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place! The guacamole is the best I've ever had, with fresh pomegranate seeds, and my lobster quesadilla was delicious! It's a great atmosphere and nice staff. And the cuisine is very authentic to southern Mexico, which is hard to find. Highly recommend it, but if you go at lunch make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our daughter's B-Day. This was a place that she had been to before and she was wanting to go back again. Even I was eyeballing photos of the famous Chiles en Nogada dish and was getting excited.  The outside of this building is covered with several crazy and colorfully painted murals. They are very psychedelic and most interesting. Inside is decorated in a similar way and has paintings of the same type of art on the walls.  We started with the table side Guacamole that everyone raves about. Guess we missed the fine print and it came straight from the kitchen. The guacamole was pretty good. But not enough to give it a $12 price tag. Not sure why they put cranberries in there. Maybe not the best match for such a dish.  Tried ordering their famous Chiles en Nogada and was told that it is a seasonal dish. They said that pomegranate was not available and they did not have the ingredients. Why put it on the menu if you do not serve it at all times? Maybe start by putting SEASONAL next to the item so that everyone knows up front.  Ordered the Pollo Poblano instead and was not very impressed. Daughter ordered the Cochinita Pibil and said it was very tender. She also said that it lacked any deep flavors and was not very exciting. My wife and son in law decided to go with the Fish Tacos. Both dishes looked really good. Again they fell short on taste as well.  Service was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. Other reviews also generally mention that this restaurant is not the same as it used to be. We thought the food was more or less A-OK with prices that were higher than desired.  Maybe it is time for a kitchen intervention or something. Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different idea of what GREAT taste like these days. LO SIENTO!  2.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Food wasn't the most authentic. It wasn't bad. Some of the dishes where very enjoyable but they have sold out. I guess if you have people from the mid west visiting they would be impressed. But I'm not hearing all the hype. Glad someone made it out of poverty but try and keep your routes."}
{"text":"This was a nice change of pace.  Weird location but inside its very charming.  Food was great and so was the service."}
{"text":"HOLY DELICIOUSNESS OF SOUTHWESTERN FOOD.  Barrio made my first meal in the Southwest memorably wonderful.  We were greeted by a 45-minuteish wait (it seems many restaurants in Phoenix don't take reservations for parties under six).  We were packed like sardines in the small waiting area, and there's not much around the area to kill time at.  After being seated, my friend and I shared the table-side guacamole (notable only due to the inclusion of pomegranate seeds!  delicious and unique) and posole (good and refreshing, but actually disappointingly bland).  The appetizers were somewhat expensive: 11$ for the guac, which only included one avocado, and 8$ for the soup.  I fell in love with my seafood enchilada: cheesy lump crab meat wrapped in a warm blue corn tortilla, over which chunks of scallops and shrimp are generously scattered.  The whole thing is finished off with a rich, creamy sauce bursting with flavor.  I polished off the whole thing.  The entree ran me 23$.  And yes, it made it to my List (the OMGWTFBBQ List).  Unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert.  Service was solid, and the place emptied out after we were seated around 8:45PM."}
{"text":"The sopa de Chile morron on was subtle, slightly sweet and really amazing. Id consider getting it as my entree, I actually stopped eating my entree to go back to this soup. The Chile en nogada was good not great but that may be because I was expecting a playful twist on a chili relleno. The filing was flavorful and the almond sauce was the perfect. The one thing I could ask for is more poblanos, maybe some slices on the inside?    I do understand the no reservations in a small place but it is still a pain to not have the option. Worst case I get to my reservation and wait 15."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe takes Mexican food (as most Americans know it) to a whole new level. From the very beginning it's evident that Chef Silvana knows her stuff. The creativity of the menu and the superb execution of the recipes is just the beginning of a wonderful taste experience.   The wait staff as well as the hostess were friendly, helpful and sincere in their appreciation of our business.   Barrio is not close to where I live but I am certain I will go back... over and over and over again."}
{"text":"Another Phoenix gem!   Don't expect hard-shell tacos, refried beans and Spanish rice here! Instead, expect bold flavors, fresh ingredients and Chef-inspired regional Mexican cuisine.   Table-side guacamole here is a must and some menu items are seasonal. The probability of a wait is high, but worth it.   Happy hour (half off drinks) is only from 2-5 pm.   Delish!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Driving up to this establishment, you would have no idea what was to come.  This is one of the best Mexican food establishments in a strong Mexican food market.  Located at 16th Street and Thomas, heading into a little bit older area of town, you don't expect to find a fine dining Mexican food experience.  I was greatly surprised.  While looking at the price of the food, and coupling it with the location, I was hoping that I would not be disappointed.  I was not.  The food was excellent.  The taco's were very enjoyable, but the surprise of the meal was the heavily seasoned french fries.  I will definitely come back on a date here, and enjoy some of the traditional Mexican dinners.  The only thing that could make the Barrio Cafe a better experience is a lunch menu.  It's tough to head out for a lunch with the only option being the Taco's at a reasonable price.  I see that there are tons of choices for Tequila.  I will have to go back and test out their varieties.  Can you call me a cab??"}
{"text":"I'm not your typical clueless reviewer in Phoenix who thinks anything that is decent is worth 5 stars. At the same time, I'm reasonable and I don't compare everything to New York restaurants, I grade relatively meaning relative to Phoenix area.  Okay, so this place is incredibly hyped. The food is outrageously expensive. I know what you are thinking \"Well this guy is cheap a$# and unlike him, I'm willing to pay for good food\" Yeah, I am not that guy either and I'm willing to pay for good food too  but when 3 people have lunch and your bill ends up being over $150 for some small enchiladas and a few margaritas, you soon realize the owners are banking on its hype and jacking up those prices just for the heII of it.  The reason Barrio Cafe is popular is simple. Phoenix has mostly chain restaurants. This is one of the few unique restaurants.  And it's not lard factory like many Mexican restaurants in the valley. You know the type of restaurant i'm talking about; the all Mexican owned and worked joint that puts lard in everything and it tastes delicious until you realize their menu isn't that different from Taco Bell aside from the lard, the mariachi music and the Dos Equis sitting in my hand. But I digress.....this place is another trendy flamboyant (read Gay) owned restaurant that serves good drinks, offers trendy waiters that pretend they are the food version of a Sommelier and act like they have a PhD in food and know so much more about chicken enchiladas than you do, so for the average Joe white dude in Phoenix, they are impressed by this. Lastly, the wait fools you. The place is tiny with no parking. Obviously, there are going to be wait times and seating issues but it really fools the first time customer into thinking the place must be amazing.  Bottomline: this place needs to drop its prices and the attitude and serve bigger portions.  And by bigger portions, I'm reasonable, I'm not Fred from Golden Corral expecting massive portions that can feed 3 people, but when 2 or 3 of their enchiladas combined  are smaller than a bean burrito from taco bell, you know someone is pinching pennies in the back.  The service also needs to improve.  Our waitress totally botched our order, and brought the wrong dish. No she didn't mistake our order with another table's, she just outright messed up but didn't apologize...and this is a big deal here because they take so long to bring your food out in the first place."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the carne assada taco e fish taco and LOVED them! What a nice and refresh experience. Will be back again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My burning question after walking out the door of Barrio Cafe on a Thursday afternoon was \"was it overpriced?\" That appears to be several other reviewers' issue with this place, and I'll answer that right up front: NO.  Firstly, it's not Tex Mex, New Mexican or Sonoran style Mexi food. It's classic, middle of Mexico style with appropriate innovations or surprises that really are worth stepping out of the tradition (i.e., craisans in the guac).  Which brings me to the other highly debated Yelp issue -- $11 guacamole. We came for lunch, so did not get the table side presentation, so right off that seems like a bust on the price. However, it was fucking tasty. I don't know, stuff that like normally infuriates me, but I did not think it was out of place here. The chips that came with it were awesome. Handmade, thicker tortilla pieces that weren't too greasy.  The service was great and unlike other reviewers, we had zilch wait. Here's the thing, if you really want to try this place and know there's a crazy long wait, suck it up and wait and don't complain about it, don't go on a Friday night, don't go at all, or try to go when is likely to be less busy, like a weekday lunch or early dinner.   I loved my cochinta pibil street tacos. The slow roasted pork was rad, the cotija cheese wonderful and the optional fries were a fun touch (i was not a fan of either sauce that came with them, some sort of spicy chipotle ketchup and a weird mustard). My sister was not in love with her poblano chile torta. It was oozing with cheese and she didn't think it had a \"meaty\" quality to make for a good sandwich. The bread it came out on, a crusty French loaf, was an interesting touch and good.   Would I come back? Yes. Would I tell others to go? Absolutely. Will I go on a Saturday night? No. I hate waiting an hour for a table so will go when I don't have to do that. Problem solved."}
{"text":"After the Arizona Republic dubbed Barrio's Cafe the #1 Mexican Restaurant in the city we found it only fitting to do some investigating.  What we found was this small, family-owned spot is a diamond in the rough neighborhood of 16th St. & downtown Phoenix.    From the windows to the walls smothered in abstract skull artwork and religious memorobilia this awnry shrinery has a character that intriques even non-believers.    With an hour and a half wait-to-be-seated promise, we entertained (but only for a moment) bouncing to another restaurant which we could have only expected a quicker, more mediocre fare.  However, that thought was vetoed immediately after spotting an article (image included) of their famous and oh so decadent goat milk caramel, candied walnut churros dish.  Worth the weight (pun intended).  Eyes on the prize, my dining companions decided drinks were in order, a round of cervezas and margaritas later we found ourselves waiting impatiently on the patio, a new addition to this establishment. During our wait we ordered chips and guacamole, of course this wasn't your typical guacamole.  The crunchy pomegranate kick with an easy on the taste buds flavor had us wishing the bowl was bottomless.    We were seated after our second round and couldn't have been more blessed with our table's location.  The table was only inches from Sonan, a Rumba Flamenca RnB band with an ambiance and sound of Mexico City this band blew our slightly buzzed party away.  You could hear a pin drop after we all opened our menu's, the immense concentration and eye sparkles were indicators that sharing entrees was inevitable.    I could sit here and list the entree's that we inhaled, but each item had a unique, can't quite put your finger on it taste that words wouldn't do them justice.  The tequila options were just as gratifying as the dishes themselves, and the dessert menu descriptors would make even a full person's mouth water.    If you haven't already visited Barrio's Cafe, I strongly recommend you do.  As a self-proclaimed foodie, full-time tweeter and avid Yelper - I know you will be raving all the way home."}
{"text":"Pretty small place in a slightly odd looking neighborhood, we werent sure if we even found the right place to begin with since we were new. However the interior is nice and cozy, but tightly spaced so I can imagine it being crowded and full. Service was a tad slow, and they served bread which was a bit of an odd choice, but the dip was good. The food itself was quite good. The Pollo Poblano was very flavorful and quite unique, we did see another table enjoy the Chiles En Nogada  as well.   There arent many veggie options though which is a bit of a bummer, the Chiles Con Queso sounds more interesting than it was in person as it was a tad too simplified. However the flavors were there and it was still a good meal. Overall, definitely worth a stop to taste something a bit different in Mexican cuisine with bold and strong flavors. Just wish the service was quicker and the overall balance of the meal was better and they had more veggie options."}
{"text":"Two words . . .  HAPPY HOUR!  Some of the reviews say dinner is overpriced.  Well, I have been to Barrio once for happy hour and it was pretty awesome!  Friday, we cut out of work early and went straight to Barrio.  Not too busy, staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I enjoyed looking at the art on the walls.  Happy hour is M-F, 3-5.  Half price drinks (ALL drinks) and $1.50 tacos.  Incredible!  There are eight different tacos: chicken, pork, carne asada, duck, shrimp, halibut, poblano pepper, and chorizo.  We couldn't decide so tried one of each.  Four tacos for each of us at $12.  Add on an order of guacamole and a few drinks, the two of us walked out of there full, buzzed, and happy at just over $40.   Again, I haven't been for dinner or lunch, so I can't comment on that end.  I can say that I would go back for happy hour any day . . . in fact, I am looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good food. Came here on a whim and was simply astounded. From the outside one would think this is your run of the mill hole in the wall Mexican joint. So not the case. My partner ( who is incredibly hard to please) had the Enchiladas Del Mar and were the best he ever had. There is no skimping on seafood, flavor, sauce or cheese. All blend together to create an experience you won't soon forget and will want to come back to taste time and again. I had the Pollo Poblano and all I can say is YUM. The cream sauce was simply divine. The chipotle mashed potatoes were off the hook. If you want to impress a date this is definitely the place to do it."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos.  They were delicious!  The wait staff was great, and it was full of people eating delicious smelling and looking food."}
{"text":"I'd consider it a hole in the all restaurant given that other location may deter people from trying it. However it is the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the valley. The chef's cooking style brings in a unique and rich flavor to traditional dishes. It is truly a gem in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I had expected. I thought it was be a cozy taqueria with style, but it was an overrated yuppie scene. Food was entirely mediocre. Bland, bland, bland. Service was slow. Overall- Meh."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is a fantastic place, and I really should go more often.  Everything I've had there is delicious and the decor is so welcoming."}
{"text":"soooo....  It was fine but I found it over priced for basic Mexican food.  I was actually disappointed that there were no beans or rice on the menu.  The bread was dry and seemed like day old.  A lot of hype for nothing.  Service was OK but not stellar and the place was dead for lunch so I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"It gets 2 stars because it's clean inside. The food was bland and over priced. The best part of the meal was the \"spicy\" ketchup that came with the fries. What legit Mexican food comes with fries? Oh wait, it doesn't. This is overpriced American Mexican food. Save your money and get something that tastes good."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place because of the killer reviews, so I had to try it. Took a big party their and it wasn't a good idea as the establishment is rather small. First thing I noticed was the highly priced food $$$. But regardless had to try the food. I ordered the shrimp tacos. I want to start off by pointing out the cool decor and friendly staff.   Food however, was a disappointment. The order itself was three street tacos. Each taco kid you not only had one shrimp, $15. Then I ordered a Jamaica $5 bucks.   I'm not sure how I feel about returning."}
{"text":"Great service, not quite Barrio Urbana. Great live performances while you eat. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Came here on a lunch break with some colleagues and was extremely disappointed. Over priced, took a while, questionable on how authentic it really is. The \"queso dip\" had just about every ingredient except queso, and it was one of the primary reasons we wanted to check this place out, but 0/6 people enjoyed it. The tacos were mini tacos at full price with 3 ingredients. Don't get the rave about this place what's so ever! Limited parking, quaint restaurant. Didn't try any, but wide selection of tequila."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Amazing food, though very different.  I will be back.  The salsa was very unusual but I would have to say the best I have ever had.  Interesting decor and service was fabulous.  If you are at Phx Children's hospital go try it out its a short distance."}
{"text":"So conflicted writing this review. Ive had amazing dining experiences here but lately the food hasnt been as good. My last visit the plating and presentation was sloppy and chicken was tough and overcooked. Due to  previous great experiences I expected the same quality. I may return to give it one more chance but with so many new restaurants it wont be anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for some time. I had some vendors who came into town, and this is where we ended up for dinner.  It really wasnt what I expected. It kind of through me for a loop. I mean, its in a very run down neighborhood (Signs say park at your own risk) with bars over windows and doors. You get in, and it looks kind of average, nothing to hint that there are some food gods working behind the wall.  They pretty much do tequilla only here. They have a tequilla list with over 100 tequillas on it. I opted for a simple margaritta with some tequilla I have never heard of and some fresh agave nectar. Wow it was good!  We got the guacamole appetizer, and it was fantasic. All fresh made right at the table. Next we moved onto the shrimp quesedillas. This was kind of an insight as to how complex these meals were going to be. The shrimp quesadillas were very good, so much so I didnt even realize I accidently ate the shrimp tail!   Looking at the menu for dinner, its definatley not your everyday mexican food your going to see here. This is kicked up a notch. I would probably call this gourmet mexican food. Never have I seen such menu items, where everything sounds so fantastic. It was like I was in mexican food heaven! I had the special of the night which was a basted lobster tail in tequilla grilled over an open wood flame, 6oz filet mignon with a langustine/chorizo goat chease mixture on top, and grilled vegetables. I think it was their way of doing the filet 'oscar style'. It was extremely good. Everything turned out fantastic.  My only complaint was parking. It was pretty tight to begin with. Our server was strictly to the point, no lolly gagging around which actually turned out to be good in this instance for us since this was a business dinner.  Would definatley visit again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Wish there was another location in the north valley because I would go more often if there was. The Chiles en Nogada is to die for. Hubby had the Azul filet. There were no leftovers!"}
{"text":"I give it a one star .... I'm not the best writing  something up so here it goes ...   Went there today and had the posole and it came out a small portion.... Last time I had it way before the hype and was a perfect portion ... So I had them take it back and got mole ... Well that was a upset since the waiter said no beans or rice ... I was like WHAT for real ... How can you be nominated as a best Mexican food place with out rice or beans it's like eating Chinese with no fried rice....   I will probably never go back .. There's nothing wrong with Changing up a Mexican menu but don't think your the best in the US because your not .... Don't get me wrong it's good food not the best ...   Now I would say  blanco Tacos and tequila in Scottsdale is way better .... And at least they have beans and rice .... Lol... But for real ...      That's my 2 cents ..."}
{"text":"The food here is el supremo I've gotta say. .it's a small place but great if you're looking to take someone out on a lunch or dinner date. .it's high quantity here nice clean atmosphere small bar section. .highly recommend. .."}
{"text":"Lots of my friends really like this place . Parking was difficult to find . Had to park a behind and go thru the alley .prices were  high compared to most other mexican restaurants.  I did like their guacamole and chips . I had their green chili which was  disappointing . The meat was dry and not very spicy . I did like e the whole beans .. I would not rank this as one of the best mexican restaurant in town . Service was also slow"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. I've been here three times now during business trips to Phoenix and have never been disappointed. This place is always busy the food is great, You have to try the fresh guacamole (with cranberries even). Tonight I had the Suiza Enchilada, previously I've had the Pollo Poblano both were excellent. I highly recommend you add Barrio Cafe to your list of favorite Phoenix restaurants!"}
{"text":"I loved Barrio Cafe's dessert but didn't care for my meal much. I ordered the Enchiladas de Hongos (mushroom enchilada) and found the dish to be overwhelmingly rich and not that flavorful (beyond cheese and cream). There was so much cheese drowning in a white creamy sauce with not enough acid or freshness to balance it out. There was a little bit of fresh pico de gallo which made the bites with it much better, but there wasn't enough for the whole dish. It was overall a very disappointing $17 dish and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My boyfriend got the Torta Poblano and liked it fine. The bread looked good and it looked like it had a lot of sauce on it. The caramel churro dessert was quite amazing and saves this restaurant from a 2 star review by my stomach. The churro was delightfully crispy on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside, and served with very yummy caramel sauce, spiced nuts (added a nice texture), and smooth vanilla ice cream.  The inside of the restaurant is on the small side and it seemed to be getting crowded. I didn't think the interior was all that nice - a mixed match of art for sale on the walls and that's about it. I wouldn't come back here for another meal, and wouldn't recommend it to other vegetarians."}
{"text":"It's a must.  This is a perfect example of why you should never judge a restaurant by its neck of the woods."}
{"text":"This may not simply be the best Mexican restaurant in the Valley, it may simply be the best restaurant, period.   The service is cool but friendly, the environment is hip and still inviting, and the food is nothing short of brilliant.   I eat there as often as possible."}
{"text":"The server had great style and said \"put the menus down\".  He described and brought out a wonderful chile relleno with shrimp appetizer.  The drinks were strong and tasty.  Duck with reduction was excellent and the table side prepared guacamole was as good as advertised."}
{"text":"There probably isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said here.  So I'll just say whenever people come from out of town, and they ask me where they can go for \"real\" Mexican food...this is where I send them.  Tex-Mex isn't Mexican.  Silvana's Chiles en Nogadas is.    I remember the first time I met Silvana, at the Botanical Garden, where she had a demo showing how many ingredients are put into a traditional mole sauce.  It's that kind of love for her food that transfers into her creations.    Yes, the lines can be long.  But there's an obvious reason for that.  Besides, the tequila selection is quite extensive.  Consider it part of the Barrio experience.  Order some chips and guac, enjoy the art, chat with the bartender, learn about the Calle16.org project, take it all in.  BTW, I think many of the people who don't like this restaurant are so indoctrinated by Tex Mex they have a hard time considering a different, and authentic take, on what Mexican food really means.  The country has 32 different states, so many different regions and cultures...it's not just tacos and burritos.   If you're not willing to be open to that, if you don't have time for a great night out...and aren't willing to wait...there's always Taco Bell.  I'd appreciate you patronize them so you shorten my own wait at Barrio."}
{"text":"We love their pomegranate guacamole...there's nothing quite like it! The only bummer is that they use craisin's in the offseason. I am picky about corn tortillas but I always order the Carne Asada tacos and get a side of their homemade tortilla chips to dip instead. Also their spicy fries and special ketchup are unique and tasty! We never leave hungry nor unsatisfied! We love this hole in the wall dive!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a few drinks, but the margaritas were exactly what I was looking for! ! Great service too. Also love the murals outside - good chance for a photo op :)"}
{"text":"Okay, my friend had been telling me for YEARS that I had to try this place out and I never got around to it. So my husband and I decided to have this be our valentines date.  We showed up and there was an hour wait, yes an hour! We decided that with it being valentines weekend, everywhere would be busy so we stayed. BEST DECISION EVER. My hubby is a self-proclaimed margarita connesuir. He had the signature marg followed by the pineapple jalapeño one and loved them both. I don't like tequila so I had the horchata and omg it was amazing! When we were seated I ordered the guacamole, thanks to other yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint. In fact, the guacamole had to be the best I've ever had. It has pomegranate seeds in it, which sounds weird, but absolutely made it!  The enchilada suiza was delicious and had a sweet taste to it that I wasn't expecting. Next time, I want to try the carne asana tacos. Hubby had the fish tacos and said they are as good as you can get away from the Oceanside. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just returned from Phoenix and Southern California for the Coachella music festival. Needless to say I was not thrilled to board an airplane with beautiful 80 degree sunny skies and return to midwest storms and freezing wind. Oh well. We had a great time in the warmth and at the festival - highlights included Mumford & Sons, Arcade Fire, Robyn and Lauren Hill.    When I arrived in Phoenix Jed's father Dan was kind to pick me up from the airport and take me to a local Mexican restaurant for lunch. Only after I returned to Chicago did I realize the chef is a James Beard nominee. I probably could have guess though because the food was tremendous (and all the awards/press on the walls helped).   It was a quick meal with a side salad and plate of tacos. I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Halibut fish tacos with cabbage & avocado, Baja sauce for $14) and I noticed that half the restaurant did as well. The presentation was beautiful and the food tasted just as good. The fish was delicious and I loved the fresh combination of avocado, cabbage and sauce (a perfect compliment to the 90+ heat outside). My starter salad was also nice and had lots of fresh fruits and nuts with a nice vinaigrette dressing.   I'm not surprised Jed was jealous that we made a pit stop at Barrio, the food was great and setting perfect (great southwest food in a rather run down strip mall). The value was great for the tacos, and the rest of menu looked the same. I look forward to my next trip back to Phoenix and the Shein Family residence (and hope a pit stop at Barrio is included)."}
{"text":"The barrio name doesn't do this place justice because everyone that worked here spoken perfect english and didn't look like border jumpers. Cool place lots of cool art. The food was really good! I had taco's and my girlfriend had the pork sandwich. 14$ & 12$ bucks thats about as cheap as you can get for a meal here other entree's are 18-25$. Definitely recommend for a date or a group of friends and they have over 100 tequilas to choose from. I love mexican food and this place just topped my list for best in phoenix."}
{"text":"I came to Az thinking I knew great Mexican food, and found that one has to hunt for the good stuff. We found the Barrio when it was 6 months old and it is still one of my top 3 restaurants in Az. People who blanch at the price are used to the family-style overly cheesy, milder Sonoran style food. Mexico's different regions represent much more complex and varied flavors than that, and the owner has studied and raised Mexican food to an art form. NOTE: someone called this \"Tex-Mex\" and I am fairly certain the owner/chef would be greatly insulted at the term. Tex-Mex is NOT Mexican food! It is a style bastardized for Anglo tastes and is not authentic to any region of Mexico."}
{"text":"I think it is a great sign when this is the place the local residents head to and you have a wait of 40 minutes.  The margaritas were awesome, the guacamole had dried cranberries in it, which sounds odd but it was surprisingly pretty awesome.   I had chicken mole enchiladas(black sauce) and it was the BEST mole I have ever had.  I would go back in a heartbeat when back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Almost missed the restaurant, the storefront at night was dark. Nevertheless it is Wonderful, delicious Mexican food. Our party ordered the Chile en Nogada, the Chuleta en Salsa Roja, the Cochinita Pibil, the Enchiladas Suizas and everything was extraordinary. My favorite by far was the Chile En Nogada. You wouldn't think that everything in that dish would work together, but the layers of flavors was like a party in my mouth! The waiter was fun, service was good. The dessert was not as good as the main dishes which is why I did not give a full five stars. We ordered the churro filled with cajeta. Somehow we don't think it was all prepared at the restaurant. If they ever make the churros from scratch it will be a winner. Definitely worth visiting if ever on the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Having been here several times over the years I guess I was waiting for a time to either impress or disappoint me to review.  Well that pretty much said it all huh.  I have never disliked the food but then again never really left the place with a glowing report.  All that I have eaten has been rather pedestrian in presentation and taste.  It is the kind of place where I will go with out kicking and screaming if a friend wants to partake, but not one I would choose on my own.  I always have the feel claustrophobia when in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate giving 5 starts, but this is one of those places that elevates cuisine and deserves it.  This has nothing to do with being fancy or pricey.  Simply, the fare here is elevated,  People seek Mexican, but for those seeking authentic Mexican, this is a place that serves fare that isn't about tacos or burritos.  Instead, it's about real food done with Mexican flair, spices and sauces.  Here, you will fall in love with chicken for how its prepared with sauces.  Here, you fall in love with guacamole because they throw in some twists.  In other words, they serve dishes that you'd have a really tough time trying to make at home.  To me, that's a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Get it? Because it's in the BARRIO??? HAHHAHAHAH.  It's interesting walking by graffiti marked brick walls and chipped away pawn shop signs into a seemingly upscale restaurant with live music and ridiculously priced tacos.  We got a good table on a Friday night and ordered margaritas and the Queso dip to start.  Our server was attentive and straight forward but seemed detached and unhappy.  Like he got called into work that night but really wanted to be playing World of Warcraft and taking bong hits.    Also, why serve bread with salsa as a complimentary app instead of chips and salsa? Are you too classy for chips and salsa, Barrio? You have to be \"different\" by giving us white bread which is horribly filling before a meal? Nonetheless, the salsa concoction was super tasty so I DID in fact eat some white bread with it then I gained 14 pounds then I ate some tacos after.    The margaritas were pretty perfect and I can always appreciate when they're served in cheap Ikea glasses instead of traditional margarita glasses because margarita glasses are, you know, pointless and difficult to handle especially after you've had, like, seven.  Though I'd never order seven margaritas at Barrio because I'm poor and this place is not for poor people.   I got the carnitas tacos and the boyfriend had the carne asada ones.  We swapped a taco each and while they were both cooked perfectly and rather delightful, nothing was very spicy, and I craved heat in everything we ordered.  It's Mexican food, yo, where's the spice?    The ambiance is nice and soothing with hip art and yuppie conversations abound.  The live music was a nice touch and the bathrooms were neat-o; a seemingly ironically decorated homage to cheesy Mexican restaurants, fully equipped with tacky crucifixes and hotel art paintings of the Virgin Mary.  I loled as I peed.   For both of us to eat there, two drinks each, two entrees and one app it was a little over a hundred bucks.  Which is why I only give Barrio three stars because while everything was pretty good, it was not a 100 dollar meal.  I feel I could find a hole in the wall authentic Mexican place right around the corner and get a few pretty awesome pork street tacos, and while maybe they won't have the same quality nor will I be able to listen to soothing Mexican guitar and lol at the ironically decorated bathroom, at least I'll still have gas money for the week."}
{"text":"Always stop in when in Phoenix with my girl Double Dee. My dish is: Chile con Queso Melted quesos de cabra y Oaxaca topped with onion and roasted poblano pepper sauté, fried papas and of course the Barrio Guacamole (w/fresh pomegranate seeds).  The joint is however too small for full size Mexicans and hot. No air conditioning which is not good.  Service and coffee are excellent."}
{"text":"My son and I just had lunch. It was fabulous. I've been there probably 10 times now. The food is great (5 stars on the food). Occasionally in the past the service was a bit slow, but today the waiter on it. The chef came up, asked about our food and spent about 5 minutes discussing other items on the menu. I took out of town friends there last year and they flipped out. Check it out people!"}
{"text":"Good food here just not worth the wait. Good luck trying to get seated ive been here 4 seperate occasions and finally i had a 45 minuet wait so we stayed"}
{"text":"So good. Small inside. Delish meals had by all 4. Should be on everyone's radar.  Caesar was an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorites... it's a little crowded, and I'd appreciate if I could see the kitchen from the dining area, but the food has always been fantastic.  It's definitely the best Mexican style food you will find in the Phoenix area.  It's a little more upscale than most and with a few tweaks could definitely hit the 5 star mark.  I also wish that the parking were a bit better."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today! Amazing little hidden gem! The food, it delicious, but the service was not (-1 star)!  Not sure if the food is authentic, but it's safe to say that Barrio has it's own style! The food is extremely flavorful and the sauces tend to be on the sweeter side. I've heard the food isn't spicy, but my salad actually was.  Sides offered are fries or salad. Quesadillas are open faced on mini corn tortillas. The kids had hard time adjusting to the new look from the traditional quesadilla. I ordered the Tacos de Pollo. They were really good, and the presentation was beautiful!   Don't leave without ordering their G U A C A M O L E   C A S E R O!!!! Made table-side (at dinner only)! It is so good, I would have been satisfied just having that for lunch.  I'm going to try to reinvent it tonight!  Sorry for the 4 stars, but our service was actually HORRIBLE! I think he treated us bad from the beginning since we had children with us. We obviously wouldn't be ordering Margarita's at lunch! Oh well, hopefully he has a better day tomorrow, but next time, I'll request to not be seated in his section!  BTW- 2 adults, 2 kids= $65 lunch...but worth it!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere.  Very friendly team.   Tasty food.  We had cochinita pibil and the halibut veracruz.   This place doesn't shy away from seasoning the cohninita pibil.  Some folks might find it over-aggressive, but we really liked it.  Very tender.  The halibut was also expertly cooked and very fresh.    One thing to note about this place is that portions are enormous.   Everything comes out super-sized and it's just something to bear in mind if your party is the sort to each want to order their own appetizer or salad -- it may be best to split these b/c the cumulative quantity of food between an app/salad and a main course is going to be overwhelming.  The tableside-prepared guacamole (which is unusual) looked pretty good -- and came with very fresh looking tortilla chips -- but at $14 (!) we passed.     Otherwise, the food here was well prepared, fresh, and flavorful."}
{"text":"The food was good, however it was incredibly pricey for the portion size.  Be prepared to load up on appetizers or else you will walk away hungry.  On a positive note, the guacamole was pretty tasty, and the pomegranate seeds really gave it a twist."}
{"text":"I wish I could transport the Barrio Café to my neighborhood in Chicago.  This is my 2nd time visiting it while in Phoenix to see my parents, and I can officially confirm now it will be on all future trips!  Love the happy hour tacos because you can try a bunch of different flavors.  This time we went for regular post-happy hour dinner and it was still amazing. The enchiladas are amazing... wow. As is the pork that is on the top of the entrée menu (I'm blanking on the name).  Drinks are outstanding as well, but very pricey for the neighborhood.  These cocktails are more like what I would expect to pay in Chicago at a restaurant downtown.  If it's your first time going there, you have to check out the bathroom... you'll get a giggle, it's intense!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! A thousand times yes! I want to eat the whole menu one day! Until then, we've had the corn esquites, the poblano chicken and enchilada suizas, and the hibiscus margarita. The manager and staff were great, and he brought out the chef so we could personally thank her for all the yummies in our tummies!"}
{"text":"This place keeps it real.  I go there as often as i can and never regret it.  Sometimes, the service is slow...but i stop taking myself so seriously and  realize i will be rewarded by the outstanding food.  This isn't a traditional \"american\" mexican restaurant.  Many dishes hail from southern mexico.  Whenever i travel to guadalajara i usually see some of the same things served at Barrio.   If you want the typical american-esque mexican food, go to macayos.  If you want fantastic, true-to-the-region mexican, go to Barrio."}
{"text":"I had to be in the area for an evening appointment and had some time, so I looked in the area for restaurants and found the Barrio. The location was in a little rough of an area - I missed it the first time and had to go around the block. It's a couple of spots in an old dumpy strip mall and very small. The parking was deplorable. You have to go around the back to an alley, and spots are cramped and just asking for fender bumps and door scratches. The parking is probably about half the capacity - I'm not sure how they can meet the zoning rules.   Inside the decor was nice - some interesting furniture pieces. It was very crowded - a good sign. I was lucky didn't have to wait long for a table. It seemed like a lot of folks were hanging out - I was there for more than an hour, and didn't see many tables change over.   The menu is unique - but makes it hard to know what you're ordering. I ordered T A C O S  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L - slow roasted pork - the pork was unimpressive. It was a bit mealy - like a lower quality roast. There was a decent amount - no sides. The sauce was interesting and different. I didn't really care for the flavor, but that was my taste. It was a distinctive flavor that I'm sure others would like. I had the choice of fries or a salad - which seemed odd. The salad was the highlight for me. It was a delicious blend of romaine with dried cranberries and queso. The menu was eclectic enough that I would like to try some other items.   The service was ok. The waiter was efficient if not overly helpful. I wasn't ordering a lot or an expensive meal, so it seemed like there wasn't any interest on his part.   The food was pricey for what it was. The quantity was pretty reasonable - I would have preferred one or two less tacos and some sides for a little variety. I might go back, but would need a compelling reason to go to that location and at that price."}
{"text":"Seriously I love this place! The live music the food, the drinks! I hade the beer and tomato juice combo, seriously I been looking for a place like this for a really long time! We had no wait and got a great table food was out in 5 min or so!"}
{"text":"From the michiladas, cochinita pibil, and the table side guac., very very good. Excellent. My new favorite place. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you've spent any credible amount of time in Arizona (and particularly in the Phoenix area), Mexican cuisine is a not only a staple, but a way of life for gringos and non-gringos alike.  And for most of us, we get what essentially can be described as the \"taco stand\" variety.  Be it tacos, burritos, quesadillas, beans & rice, the usual suspects.  But if you look hard enough you'll find a few restauranteurs brave enough to go beyond the taco stand and explore the various cuisines unique to the different regions of Mexico.  Silvana Esparza is such a chef.  And given the chance, she'll open you up to what you never thought Mexican cuisine could be.  If you're coming here for the first time, do as I did and order the items on the menu that they make special note of.  For example, I got the Lowrider Margarita, their signature drink with 100% pure agave tequila, lime juice, salt, and an extra ingredient I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Opens up your taste buds right away.  For the appetizer, the Guacamole dip is a must.  And this isn't your grocery store guacamole dip nor like any guacamole you've had at a restaurant.  There's seven ingredients that they incorporate table side including (of all things) pomegranates.  Its a sweetness note that immediately sends this guacamole dip into a whole nother stratosphere versus other guacamole dips.  For the main course, I went with Chef Silvana's signature dish, the Chiles en Nogada.  Chicken, four different types of fruit, queso fresco, and a delicate cream sauce stuffed into a roasted poblano pepper.  Its got some kick to it, but not overly spicy at all.  But savory and decadent as can be as that cream sauce is phenomenal.  For dessert, we went with the Churros topped with caramel, vanilla ice cream, candied pecans, and strawberries.  The churros are soft, but crispy with just the right amount of cinnamon and the caramel paired perfectly with the surprisingly intense vanilla bean flavor of the ice cream.  So here's where it can get dicey.  The prices.  If you're used to paying cheap prices for regular Mexican fare, don't worry, you're not alone.  But this upscale food doesn't come cheap.  Total cost for all of my dishes including tip was about $70.  Some people I've gone with are pretty shell shocked sometimes.  Now that said, they have taco dishes as well as other more inexpensive items that won't break the bank.  But if you ask me, you'd be missing out if you go with a safer dish just to save some money.  You'll be missing out on what makes this restaurant an icon in the valley.  I've now been here 3 times and tonight was just as awesome as the last two.  The tacos, the moles, the tortas, as well as all the unique dishes that get their own category are worth the trip and the extra few bucks.  There are legions of awards and accolades Chef Silvana has to her credit over the years.  But my taste buds are what crowns this woman the queen of Mexican food in the valley."}
{"text":"So they put craisins in their guacamole, that doesn't justify the price.  If you are going here for a meal for two with drinks, appetizers, and dessert, It's going to be expensive and not worth it."}
{"text":"Add mine to the list of 'damn, the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish. Add also that the service - yeah, you Dario - was bogus. Guac order came with the entrees, side salad for one of the three of us never delivered or acknowledged as missing, and generally a sense that he was doing us a favor coming to work today. Neat.   On food grounds alone its very fine. I had the langostine quesadilla and it was delish: a nice chunk of lobster on each [and there are four 4\" tortillas/quesadillas], in a sweet sauce that was perfectly countered by goat cheese. I tasted the fish tacos - also seemed perfectly matched: the slight heat of the baja sauce, perfectly cooked fish [lightly battered and not at all heavy or greasy]and cabbage...nice. I didn't try the mole but the report was bland. We all loved the guac and the chips. [Two of us had soda, one an iced tea - bill came to $72 before tip for three of us.]  Be warned, this is not a quiet place. Even two-thirds full at lunch, its loud. I could see bringing friends and drinking margaritas, and having the noise just be part of the enjoyment. Now if only Dario would stay home..."}
{"text":"I can say that I will not drive from North Scottsdale down to barrio cafe anymore   The service was absolutely deplorable ,I had to ask for water 4 times   The chiles en Nogada was not prepared correctly   The meat was not chopped up,  it was big chunks of meat   It was absolutely not worth the drive or the money they charge.  They better get their act together or they're going to be out of business.  Too bad,  she is living off for past reputation"}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say that I've only been here once. It was a great experience. They don't take reservations last I checked. They have an excellent pork dish and awesome churro desert! Their guacamole is freshly made at your table and is an authentic version. They are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"I finally got to visit Barrio last week for the first time, and like most everyone, I was not disappointed. I did however need some help from the server choosing what I should eat and drink. For 2 reasons. One: Everything looked so interesting and good. Two: The title's were in Spanish and I was not familiar with some of the meat's and their name's in Spanish. He suggested the Paloma. A Drink I am a fan of and I would have to say this is one of the best Paloma's I've had, perfectly balanced, sweet, tart, strong, yet not over powering.   I remember hearing some where about their bread and olive spread and how fabulous it was. Sure enough, very satisfying. To start we got the Esquites: Buttered roasted corn kernels topped with chipotle cream, aged cotija cheese, cilantro and fresh lime juice. The perfect way to start a meal, it was light so that it did not fill us up too much yet so rich and zesty. For my entrée I finally settled on Enchiladas del Mar: Blue corn tortillas filled with quesos Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream reduction. Talk about rich. The sauce was rich but didn't over power any flavor of the seafood. The Quesos Oaxaca Cheese strangely complimented the seafood and the portion was very generous. We finished the night off with the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra:  Churros filled with goat's milk caramel, served with vanilla bean ice cream,and topped with mas caramel and candied pecans. The goat's milk caramel was a bit too much for me. However, my husband licked this plate clean. I was impressed. I couldn't get enough of the candied pecans, Carmel and ice cream.  I think what made this night so special though is the atmosphere of this place. It was small and cozy. They had this amazing live music. 2 men, a few instruments, and beautiful voices. They were very funny as well. They made us giggle, bob our heads, and sway to the music as we enjoyed our meal. I really cant wait to bring some friends and family to this place."}
{"text":"Saw this pace on Triple D and had to try it.  In a word - magnificent.  The food here is phenomenally good, everything on the menu.  Just exquisite flavors and textures.  No, you are not going to be served chips and salsa, but rather bread and an olive tapenade that is to die for.  Yes, they do offer tacos and enchiladas, but the are not what you are used to in all other Mexican restaurants.  This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, regardless of the style of cuisine.  I would eat here again and again, and oh, by the way, I am a chef and a very, very picky one at that.  Two downers - no draft beer, just bottles.  The other is that our server was less than attentive for the price of the food.  Not horrible, but just not up to the quality and price of the food.  I had to ask for a refill on my drink, which a good waiter would have done automatically without my having to ask.  That's the reason for not giving this place 5 stars, and the only one.  Pricey, yes, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and some of his colleagues for dinner. This place is DELICIOUS. Our waiter, Richard, was extremely attentive and kind. I asked him what his favorite dish was on the menu and he took the time to describe each dish. One thing to note about Barrio, as Richard pointed out, is that all of their dishes have little to no spice. Nevertheless, they did have this amazing habanero salsa that complimented the dishes very well. My boyfriend got the Suizas Enchiladas and I split the Tomatillo y Chile Verde as well as the Chiles en Nogada with a friend. I didn't get to try my boyfriend's dish because I was so full from the other two, but he seemed to enjoy it very much. The chile verde dish was OK, I probably wouldn't order it again, but the Nogada was to die for. Highly recommend! Also, their table side guac is phenomenal! They put pomegranate seeds in it! Yum yum yum.  Lastly, it's a small restaurant and they don't take reservations. If you've got a large party, definitely show up early. There's a private parking lot in the back, but it's also a little small."}
{"text":"Love Barrio guacamole and margaritas. Service is awesome as well ! I suggest going on taco Tuesday for better value"}
{"text":"A favorite spot for my hubbs and I. Table-side guac (even at $10 a pop) is amazing. Everything on the menu always satisfies. We usually try their special since we've been through everything on their standard menu. Goat cheese churros with fresh whipped cream or ice cream (if they aren't out) is a must.   My husband tries a different tequila each visit and with their selection, we could be coming back for 400 years and not try every one... I always get some kind of Cadillac drink. I always forget the name and the server knows what I'm ordering before I do. They don't make bad drinks here. Believe me!  The wait is always long and the prices are high- but sometimes it's just worth it, ya know?   Atmosphere is perfection. Just don't get sat at the table by the bathroom."}
{"text":"One of the best damned Mexican food restaurants in town. A don't miss for any foodie."}
{"text":"The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and love how they do pomegranate seeds in their guacamole"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and like going to the Barrio's Cafe in the Phoenix airport.  Problem is... my advocacy is loosing momentum with each visit due to the servers spending more time complaining about their job and co-workers than paying attention to creating a vibe worthy of repeat. Please get back on track."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, the best Mexican food we've ever eaten.  Period.  Barrio Cafe sets the bar so high, few can reach it, let alone attempt to try.  Thanks, Aaron, also for treating us so well as our waiter.  Mucho gracias!"}
{"text":"Food is good,but guacamole is more expensive than Scottsdale's Hacienda restaurant at The Fairmount Princess Hotel,this place is tiny !!!!"}
{"text":"I called my friend who lives in Tucson up and was like \"Oh hey, I'm headed to Phoenix. Let's do dinner!\" Given my Northeastern-ness and general geographical warp of the rest of the United States, I assumed it was a \"quick jaunt.\" After correcting me and mentioning the 115 mile drive, my friend mentioned that she had few ideas, but had heard of this terrific upscale Mexican place called Barrio Café. Turns out it was worth the lead!  Barrio Café has an interesting menu presenting thoughtfully prepared Mexican dishes with flair. I really enjoyed the tableside guacamole preparation (which included pomegranate seeds, which I hadn't seen in guac before), and their extensive tequila and margarita menu was great. I had a delicious chicken in black mole dish which was awesome. The mole sauce was flavorful and rich, and the consideration of flavor profiles and the way colors played on the plate was impressive. This is no taco joint! The price point is a bit higher than average for Mexican food in Phoenix, but offers a more sophisticated and elegant range of choices if you're looking for something slightly upscale.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and the spare, but colorfully decorated dining room was pleasant. By the time we exited, the restaurant was packed and I can see why. Another great find in Phoenix, and recommended if you're in the area looking for a leisurely, tasteful dining experience."}
{"text":"Best high-class Mexican food I've ever had.  What a delightful experience.  Excellent food.  Great service.  Recommended.  Ain't no chips N dip place.  All of our group were pleased with the food.  GREAT FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"While this place is pricey - you do get what you pay for. The ambience is awesome and authentic. The food is outrageously delicious and the staff are friendly and attentive. Love this place for a nice date night or when we are craving some good food and don't mind paying a higher price."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexican dinning.  My wife and I went here to eat.  We thought with the name it would be great authentic Mexican food. It is not at all what the name would lead you to believe.  Pork wrapped in banana leaves, $12.00 drinks, very fusion, upscale and hipster. Different....quite expensive."}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant and the unique dishes they prepare.  Tried it for the first time last week and blew my socks off.  Fantastic!  Atmosphere was fun, staff were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great little joint, excellent service. I got the fish tacos and my husband got the pork tacos. Both were delicious. We were glad we got there at 4:30 bc there was quite the wait as we were leaving. Margaritas were good too, and half price before 5 (even on a Saturday!)."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great people. Corn is amazing. Funny that there are no chips and salsa. Entrees were delicious. We would highly recommend if you are looking for good food and unpretentious service."}
{"text":"Great Great Food, but go to the bank first and check you account balance cause the prices are ridiculous.  Guacamole is very different but in a good way. Appetizers are amazing. Main dishes, although flavorful, are incredibly expensive. Their version of Carne' Asada is serving them taco style. It might be Mexican Cuisine, but I'm not a fan.  Their favored Margarita known as the \"low Rider\" will sneak up on you so be careful. It will also sneak up on your wallet at 13 dollars a pop.  Service in the restaurant for us was good but the food came out too slowly so be aware that you might have to wait a while. It's also very loud with hard floors and the place packs up pretty fast.  My advice is to go for a nice bottled beer and share a main course meal OR go at happy hour and save some coin on some incredible good appetizers. At lease you can enjoy the food and not break the bank!  Would I go back again? prolly' not...  Stew~"}
{"text":"The next time Su Vida recommends a restaurant they should make sure there is excellent service. I think I might just write to the TV show. Rude service by the manager or owner. Apparently, they can't wait for your entire party to arrive. He was so anxious to seat my family because of a game. He was estimating a larger crowd but tables were empty by the time I got there. We are asked if we could be moved in order to seat us all (7) he said we asked for 5 and then wanted to argue with my sister in law about what she said. His final words you can wait or leave. It's not even an upscale restaurant so I guess that's type of service that can be expected. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND this place to anyone. Headed to \"La Santísima\" and it was also crowded but they made it work."}
{"text":"I love this place! Yum!! I ordered the carne asada tacos with a corona. Hit. The. Spot! Reasonable prices. Our server, Gabriella, was very friendly. Parking can be limited but don't let that deter you. Highly recommend Bario Cafe!"}
{"text":"A wasted cab ride for mediocre food  The Barrio Cafe is horribly overrated.  Upon arriving at eleven for lunch, they tried to sit us in the very back, next to the bathroom, even though the place was empty.  The house margaritas were okay, but not even close to the ones from Sam's Cafe.  The chipotle chicken dip was a mess of cheese and slimy chicken, slimy spinach, and slimy mushrooms.  You sense a theme?  The smokey, sweet flavor was good for a bite or two, but it quickly became an unappetizing mess.  My husband's pork was supposed to be the special of the restaurant, but it was nothing special, and some of it was unbearably dry.  My enchiladas del mar were smothered with a horrendous quantity of cheese, and I had no idea how I was supposed to eat them, as there seemed to be mere scraps of blue tortilla amid the massive amounts of sauce and cheese.  The shrimp were decent sized, but undercooked (understandable since the tiny scallops and crab would cook a lot faster).  The churros were the highlight, but they couldn't save the meal.  Lunch ran over $100, plus cab fare.  I would rather have given the money to one of the homeless people by the Hyatt Regency.    Another chef told me that the head chef of Barrio Cafe has left, so maybe that explains the divergent reviews.  All I know is that I would never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally found a great tasting fish taco.  This restaurant is not as casual as a cafe.  The fish tacos were sooo good.   All the customers seemed like regulars and ordered all types on entrees.  The desserts looked amazing as well.    Will def go back!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I'm not a member of the 'clean plate club' but I was jumped in last night and I have the food baby to prove it. Delicious southern Mexico style cuisine that yes, will put a minor ding in your wallet if you choose to enjoy a couple of perfectly crafted margaritas with your dinner. It's worth it, trust me. Take note of the extensive Tequila list.  Guess what!? It's not Sonoran people and if you're looking for deep fried chimichangas the size of your arm, smothered in oily sauce and a pound of cheese for $7.99 you're in the wrong place. Hey, I love Sonoran Mexican food. I had the pleasure of working in one of the best damn Son restaurants in Tucson in my late teens. I have a fucking green corn tamale where my cold black heart should be ok..... My point is I'm not hating, just don't be a tool. Do some basic research on a place before you decide to grace it with your presence. There's this thing called the internet, you can check out many a restaurants FULL MENU from it, including prices...and if you get bored doing that there's always porn! Hey now!  Moving on.. We shared the Cochinita Pibil - Slow roasted pork with achiote rojo& sour orange. It was melt in your mouth amazing served with perfectly tender corn tortillas to wrap the whole mess up in. I will have dreams about this pork, no joke. We also shared the Chilies en Nogada - Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears (yes, I'm still listing) and apricots finished with almond sauce and pom seeds. Ohhhhh, sweet lady guadalupe, if this wasn't an immaculate conception in my mouth I don't know what is. Expectations - met/exceeded.  I did find it slightly odd that dessert wasn't 'sold' to us a bit more as we were only offered just that....dessert. What? No visuals? Bummer, because our inner fat kids would've taken over at that point and we wouldn't have had to stop at Culvers on the way home.... just sayin."}
{"text":"I agree with a previous review I read on foodnetwork who commented on the expencsive chips and guacomale. Though homemade and very fresh, I fiubd that the guacomale was too soicy for me and was made with an odd combination of crannberries on top. A bit over priced I sat in one day at the bar and ordered an iced horchata at happy hour which comes in a rediculously cool CocaCola glass bottle from the 70s or something. Unfortunately they made mine wrong b I had ask for no Kahlua being one of the rare few who dislikes coffee. But the bartender redid my drink Horchata, ice and only cream liquor. It was EXCELLENT! Usually I grab virgin horchatas around town at the Sinaloan or Mexican smaller restaurants around town. But the recipe is so amazing at Cafe Barrios. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Ice cold drinks at a good price are much needed in this hot summer weather in Phoenix, Az! So milk it up #horchata #highendmexican #cafebarrio #punintended #ricemilk #staygood #summer  Read more at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/restaurants/az/phoenix/barrio-cafe-restaurant.html?oc=linkback"}
{"text":"This is not a typical Sonoran Mexican food place, so you have to leave that craving at the door.  Rather, it's inspired by a number of regions around Mexico, with great result.  One tip... They get \"heat\" and will adjust or accommodate (though some dishes can't be dialed back; they know which ones and can advise).    When the server says it's hot, she's probably not calibrating to some bland Midwestern palate (ie, garlic mashed potatoes are spicy)  but to the desert rat tongue (mas jalapenos por favor).  Even better, they can kick it up a few notches if you ask, and are happy to cook in extra peppers or chiles.    They have a terrific selection of tequilas, though these come at a somewhat excessive cost.  It would be nice to match up a few choice  agave spirits with the meal without feeling like I've been rolled.  That almost made it a three, but this place just isn't average, so have your shots elsewhere."}
{"text":"BEST guac in the city.  The Asada tacos are the best.  My hubby loves the cochinita pibil.  Also the Flan...yummmmm!!!!  The bar has several Tequila options...AH-mazing!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I had high expectations. This is one of those places that were really good, made a name for itself, and then sorta stopped caring...kind of like the waiter that is so often spoken of.  You know, the forgetful one that just doesn't seem to care too much.  The guac is no longer made at the table.  It was a bit bland. The tortillas chips were pretty tasty however.   Slow roasted pork, pazoles verde, fish tacos, sangria, and bloody marry were all good.  But no great.    Given the quality of the food, I would say the prices are a bit too high.    Glad to have tried it but will most likely never go back.    I'd rather go to Gallo Blanco.  The food there, I think, is slightly better in quality and cheaper in price."}
{"text":"Lobster quesadillas, guacamole & good cold Mexican beer. Restaurant not keen on the chips & salsa like typical restaurants- however the chef was kind enough to give us a yummy bowl. Long wait for a table &limited parking are 2 downfalls."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for awhile, and decided to do it for my birthday. For a Wednesday night it was packed, but we seemed to have gotten the last available table-woohoo! I didn't bother with the guac since the majority of the reviews don't really tout it, and chose to start with the langosta tacos appetizer. They were my favorite part of the meal! So good I could have eaten all four and ordered more, but instead I chose an entree. I had the poblano chicken and JD ordered the chile relleno. Neither of us were really crazy about either dish. Both were on the bland side and my chicken was totally overcooked. We kind of swapped food and I liked his more than mine just because it had scrumptious zucchini!   All in all, we weren't really impressed except for the taco app. The service was so-so, not terribly friendly or outgoing and the entrees weren't memorable or delicious (or worth what they cost in my opinion) I'll probably not return, there are other places that serve better food at better prices and with much better service."}
{"text":"Wow.   See, I've driven by Barrio Cafe a number of times and thought how good can it be? It's a dumpy looking place...and look at all this hype?   Believe.the.hype.   This isn't some $1 taco place. This is a dining experience. Tableside guac. Queso fundido that is out of this world. Enchiladas suizas so good you'll smack your Abuela. It's that kind of experience.  The staff is very helpful, attentive, and very efficient. Their busser stacked an entire 4 top worth of dishes on his arm and carried it all away....in one visit. It was impressive.   It's SUPER cozy inside so prepare to suck it in a little when you walk by tables to go to the bathroom. The one thing I didn't like was that they had a singer there on Friday night. He was great...but because it's so cozy in there, he didn't need a microphone to sing. But he had a microphone. And he was loud. And it made talking really difficult.  That's kind of a bummer but everything else totally made up for it. The artwork inside is vibrant, colorful, unique and fun.   I really can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friend suggested we head to Barrio Cafe for Happy Hour...and we did just that. We ordered a few items off of the Happy Hour menu and enjoyed a few drinks. We pretty much had the dining room area to ourselves. Tasty. No complications just a great time. Barrio Cafe never disappoints. For all those that have had bad experiences here, I hope I never go to BC with you...I'd hate for you to jinx my meal! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Leave your expectations for traditional Mexican food at the door. The food is very fresh, not terribly spicy, but unusual in a good way. We went for happy hour (from 3 to 5 Tues through Fri) and started with the tequila and lobster quesadillas for the table. Then we all ordered the $1.50 tacos in various forms. We all thought the halibut taco was the best, closely followed by the roasted pork tacos, but they were all outstanding.  We also had most delicious $6 margaritas I've ever tasted. Oh and the guac...not traditional, but fantastic. I would never have thought of pomegranate seeds in guacamole but I loved it.  Save room for the flan. I usually pass on flan but my brother insisted, and it's the real deal."}
{"text":"You don't want to miss this place! And I completely agree with the other travelers. You MUST get the guacamole and try to come in during happy hour if you can!  Staff was great!  The art, decor, and ambiance was really cool. The parking at the back of the restaurant is decorated with great graffiti art. And then there is the food...Everything was SO delicious and fresh.  The food is easily the best Mexican food I've ever had. We had the Cochinita Pibil and Carne Asada and both of them were perfection.  Prices are a bit more than your average Mexican restaurant but completely worth it. You get what you pay for.  Definitely give Barrio a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday night, all hustle and bustle, order a drink while you wait, or ask for one of the three seats at the bar, which is what my friend and I did, with no regrets. We had fun making up stories for the kaleidoscope of tequila bottles on display in the coziest of bars you ever did see. The pozole was out of this world, the Margaritas fresh, the live music soulful, and the scene vibrant. Best night out in a Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner experience, the chiles en nogada was awesome, sweet, savory, spicy all in one dish, so much flavor and the tres leches cake was the best rendition I've had.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I did some research before my day business trip to Phoenix, and Barrio was the target lunch destination. The \"tattooed\" exterior is really cool, and great signage to find Barrio.  I had the tacos de cochinita de pebil with french fries, and I must tell you; Wowwaweewa! The pork was flavortown, and it was \"the. most. tender. meat. I have ever eaten.\" The tortilla held the contents, but ripped tenderly when bit.  The ketchup for the fries was so good, and very unique; it was spicy.  The churros dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"First, let me say I really wanted to love this place.  Was looking for great Mexican fare on a Friday evening. Ran into positive reviews for this gourmet taco shop by a renowned chef! A close friend rants and raves about cochinita pibil in old town San Diego so when I noticed this dish in the reviews we had to try it. We started with a jamaica margarita which was delicious, not too sweet, refreshing and potent, perfect.     The bread with olive tapenade hit the spot as well. My dish which was the poblano torta had a great combination of flavors. The cochinita pibil was just ok and the steak fries that came with it were too salty for our taste. Don't know if this is the norm or if they just happen to go a bit shaker happy on this occasion. We decided the place was way overpriced for the food offered. Thanks for the experience and authentic artsy decor."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I am from out of state and I plan trips around this place. The pork that is cooked in  the banana leaf is so juicy and delicious! To top it all off, get the caramel churro relleno!"}
{"text":"This is the best gourmet mexican I've ever had.   If I'm spending more than 3 hours in Phoenix, AZ.  I'm at this restaurant for 2 of them."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place esp. with all the great reviews.  The experience was disappointing.  The service was fair at best.  There was four of us and when the food finally came out it was all luke warm.  Overall, the meals were ok but nothing that would want me coming back or recommend to others.   There just didn't seem to be anything exceptional that would make this place stand out above others."}
{"text":"Very good Queso Fundido. My Relleno Vegano was very good as well. Enchiladas were \"eh\". Good churros."}
{"text":"This ain't your typical peasant food, so don't come expecting beans and rice, Bubba.  Expect extraordinary tastes in every bite!  My last vist was pan seared halibut with crab, scallops and shrimp in a wonderfully spicy white sauce with chorizo nubbies.  The accompanying crispy fresh veggies were nestled in some form of whipped potatoes will give you great pleasure too.  Even the beginning tapenade with fresh bread is delicious.  Come with high expectations - you will go away very happy."}
{"text":"Small place. Interesting art on the walls. Everyone working there is friendly and seems to love their job, even if they are slightly overworked dealing with the multitudes of people. Margaritas are a little pricy but taste good; I recommend the spicy one. Boyfriend and I ordered the chicken mole (half red and half black) the cochinitas plates. Both were delicious; I favored the mole because a really good mole is hard to find. Will come back when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Second time here and it was better than the first. Our waiter was perfect. I spilled my drink all over the table and changed our order, he dealt with it very professional and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. Can't wait to go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is definitely as good as it gets for Mexican food in Phoenix!  We had not been to the original Barrio in 10+ years, so decided to stop in again for their amazing enchiladas suizas...they were just as good as I remembered too.  I enjoyed a hibiscus agua fresca with my lunch and they even gave me a to go cup when leaving.  Quaint dining room, great service and seriously amazing food!"}
{"text":"I have been dining here for many years and althou gh the food is excellent,  I have noticed the portions have gotten smaller.  The last time having the crab enchiladas there was half as much seafood and for the price they get , that is why only  3 stars."}
{"text":"My friend was craving authentic Mexican food, so we stumbled across Barrio Cafe as being one of the highest rated Mexican restaurants in the area. I believe that the Barrio Cafe specializes in Yucatan Peninsula-style Mexican cuisine. First things I noticed were the amazing Dia De Los Meurtos murals all around the restaurant. You can see the restaurant painted with the traditional imagery, and the murals are all over the back lot. The restaurant had a wonderful ambiance. We came in during the lunch hour, and I was pleasantly surprised to walk in to a live performance of a man playing the Spanish guitar. He played beautifully! I ordered the Pescado tacos (fish tacos), and I got to try my friend's Cochinita Pibil tacos and my other friend's Chilaquiles red mole.   I absolutely LOVED my fish tacos. The fish were perfectly battered, and all the cream sauces and flavors complimented the fish tacos very well. I'd even say that Barrio Cafe's fish tacos are on my top 3 list of the best fish tacos I'd ever have. I ordered the side salad to go along with my tacos. My salad came with mixed greens, cotija cheese, cranberries, pico de gallo, and a balsamic vinaigrette. As simple as my salad was, it was delicious as well.  Barrio Cafe's Cochinita Pibul tacos are excellent! The Cochinita Pibul is prepared by slow roasting pork overnight in a banana leaf with sour orange and achiote (some type of Mayan spice). You can definitely taste the tanginess in the pork from the sour orange.   I thought my friend's Chilaquiles with red mole was good too. The mole wasn't overly sweet as most moles taste to me since they're made with chocolate, and the mole had a nice smokiness to it."}
{"text":"If you are going to go to Barrio, do not go for their tortas. Unfortunately, that's exactly what I ordered. The torta de pollo pibil that I ordered was extremely dry. I would have sent it back had the occasion been less formal. A $15 mistake on my part. Tortas el Rey would have been a MUCH better choice.  The dishes that my friends had looked very appetizing. When I get a few more dimes to rub together I will return."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe was pretty good, but a bit pricey for what they deliver. When I got there it was completely packed, and due to the very small amount of space in the restaurant, a bit hard to navigate through.   My table started off with a bunch of appetizers. I found it interesting that they made the guacamole right in front of us, but I couldn't help but think that it was just a gimmick to justify the $11 price tag (and no, it wasn't a lot of guac, just one avocado). The server was nice enough though, albeit a bit rushed, and the flavors were very good. I especially like the tapenade; it was superb.   After the apps came the main courses. I have to respect a place that has a passion for seafood in the middle of the desert. A large portion of Barrio's menu consisted of different variations of shellfish and fish. I ended up ordering the torta with crab meat and chicken. It was pretty good, but I felt that the crab overpowered the whole sandwich, even with the hollandaise sauce that cover nearly every bite. It had a lot of potential, but I'm not sure that I would order it again. On the flipside, I tried their chicken enchiladas and those were great. They are served in a small skillet and they are buried in a sea of delicious toppings. I'm glad Barrio could do this classic some justice and add it's own spin on it.  After taking my last few sips of sangria we began to part from Barrio Cafe with leftovers aplenty. Four people, a $200 tab and the satisfaction of trying a new place. I'm glad I got to go, but I'm not sure when I will be returning. Some people may really enjoy it, some may not."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Soup $12, enchiladas $22! No rice and beans. We walked out and went somewhere else. This place is a rip off. We would never pay these prices for one meal. We will never be back!"}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to this amazing restaurant. We typically go little early, so the line is not too long. When you go in later on weekends there's music, which can sometimes make conversation little difficult.  The restaurant is small but the service is excellent. There is a man who clears and sets tables so skillfully that it is a show in itself.  Now for the food. The chef won a James Beard award and it shows. On this visit, I had the Veracruz which is a savory fish dish prepared with olives and capers.  I've had this at other restaurants, but never as good as this.  My husband had the pescado del mar, which was heavenly.  The guacamole is pricey, but prepared at your table and well worth it.  Portions are generous, but save room for some crepas de cajeta- glorious caramel with cinnamon pecans and a ball of ice cream...worth every little calorie.  We go out to dinner pretty often, but this is our favorite."}
{"text":"I didn't get to upload a picture because I was on a date and that shit would've been awkward but the ambience was fantastic the music and the lighting set the mood and the bombest drink I've ever had is called, \"Chata\" it's like Horchata and Khalua and something else.. Super Bomb!! I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"The table side guacamole with pomegranate is super super good..$8 though. The main dishes are $25 a plate and only mediocre. I hear from others some of their main dishes are REALLY good so perhaps it was just what I ordered."}
{"text":"You might have to wait here because they don't take reservations but it's worth the wait!!!  Authentic Mexican food, many types of margaritas and other cocktails to try, and a fun atmosphere. I loved the pork tacos. Shredded pork that was tender and perfect and pico de gallo. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I guess ALL the  hype had my expectations up - did not meet the hype or deliver. Food was good - but service was better. Not fond of bread with Mexican food and French fries are certainly different.  Good selection of margaritas little pricey -- my preference is still Barrio Queen in Scottsdale, better food , overall atmosphere, parking , location to walking , places to drink , dance and hangout after dinner.    One other suggestion is the owner should stay out of politics and focus on the restaurant  business or run for Mayor:)!"}
{"text":"Great place for traditional Mexican food.  Place is small and cramp, but the food is wonderful.  The vibe is also fun and casual."}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to eat somewhere from Diners Drive Ins and Dives and picked Barrio's Cafe. Interestingly enough, this Mexican restaurant served FRIES as a side. The traditional chips and salsa was replaced with bread. I ordered the carne asada tacos. The arrived almost half on hour later. The meat was also extremely salty.  Also, the chicken kids tacos where very dry."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere!!! It is great to see one of my fellow Mexican's hit it out of the park. We both had Fish Tacos!  They were great & gone in minutes! The Guacamole was different and great!, chunks of Avocados, Pomegranates, Cilantro, & Purple Onions equals yum.  Great back entrance to restaurant, even better Chicano Art, I would love to have bought a t-shirt but not in black, it's too hot here for black.  Will bring all my family and friends when they are visiting from out of town.  A Phoenix  hidden gem."}
{"text":"Can't say I have ever had a bad meal here.  It was crowded last time I was in so I chose to sit at the bar for dinner.  At first the bartender wasn't very talkative, but by the end of my meal he had warmed up a bit and I enjoyed chatting with him.  Good food as always!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing. I was impressed with the atmosphere from the second I walked it with the love music. When I heard about the Pomegranate Guacamole, my first thought was another booshie spin on a classic Mexican dish. Needless to say I was blown away. They had an amazing selection of tequila and drinks I order a Victoria even thou it wasn't on the menu. Considering it just became available in Phoenix this year I understood.  For my main course I choose Tacos de Cochinita Pibil. Normally I am left still hungry when ordering a taco platter this is not the case with these small tacos stuff with all this with wonderful ingredients fresh and flavorful. Great service, great food and great ambiance have made Barrio Cafe my new weekly must go place!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was good (we did hear another server complaining about her table right next to us, but whatever). The menu was unique and offered several options! The only thing was... it was a bit pricey... we did over hear other patrons complaining about the price of their drinks and take it out on the server by NOT tipping, well leaving her .75 on a 26 dollar tab. Classy. I would definetley return."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile & it lived up to the hype. Their La Picocita margarita is one of the best margaritas I've tasted. We came at happy hour which was good because the drinks were half off at that time & that margarita during normal business times is $12!  We only had soups & an order of Queso Fundido but it was all absolutely rich & delicious!  The one thing I would say to remember about this place is it's pricey, so if you are going there plan to spend some cash.  And if you are having adult beverages with it, maybe getting there before happy hour ends would be a good idea to have a couple of drinks at half price before they jump back up to $12-13 a drink."}
{"text":"if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to."}
{"text":"Conserve water. Drink tequila.  When in Mexico. Si. When in the Barrio. Si. Si. Si.  Enter through the back where you park.. and sit in this artistic gem of a restaurant. It's tight. So suck it in. The strum of a guitar played as we tucked ourselves into our table. There is live music here from Thursday thru Saturday in the evenings and adds to the ambience. A very nice touch to this quaint place with amazing food. It's definitely tight in here. It reminds me of cafes in Europe. You may or may not get to know your eating neighbors. So since we are conserving aqua.. I started with the Paloma. It came delivered by our friendly waiter with a salted rim and consisted of Patron Reposado Tequila, Mexican grapefruit soda and fresh lime juice. My husbands house margarita was legitimately worthy. We started with the table side guacamole. Our waiter rolls up and makes this with whatever you like. Pomegranates? We will pass. But everything else and it was perfect with awesome chips. The bread and an olive spread paste that was complimentary for the table was very good too. The menu is so diverse and some of the best native Mexican dishes from Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza that I have seen outside of Mexico. It's truly hard to decide on one thing! I ended up ordering the Enchiladas del Mar. These enchiladas are blue corn tortillas  filled with quesos of Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with lots of shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream. I had the scallops held and that wasn't a problem. One small issue after they were delivered, is that I wanted a salsa type sauce. My waiter seemed either confused or taken aback. I even pointed out the sauce/salsa on other plates on the table and he pretty much just didn't bring it! Cmon now! The enchiladas were amazing! I just wanted to 'salsa' them up a little.. okay. So, one of the other people got an extra salsa and simply passed it to me. As, he simply never brought it. While dining the Filet de mi Tita arrived at the table next to us. I have never been one to go to a Mexican cafe and order steaks.. THIS time.. its on my 'to go back and order list'.. THIS steak was HUGE! It was on the menu for $26 and was piled with crab. I have had lesser filets in steak restaurants for way , WAY more than that price! Following dinner I ordered the cafe. I had no idea this was going to arrive in a larger than normal french press! $3.95 and you get a HUGE french press full of amazing Mexican cafe and pure cream..if you choose. Enough to share, trust me. We also just HAD to share the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra. They are also pretty big! Shareable and filled with creamy, rich goat's milk and caramel; then served warm with vanilla ice cream , MORE warm caramel and candied pecans. The Flan de mi Miami. I mean, we had to order and share this too! Also topped with candied pecans and a little Kahlua and a generous portion, as well. Melt in your mouth amazing.  The facade of The Barrio Cafe is in itself so unique.. I spent at least ten extra minutes taking photos of the art. Inside there is more eclectic art, as well. As we left we felt lucky for getting to The Barrio Cafe about 615pm on a Friday night and not having to wait more than 15 minutes, because as we were leaving there was a HUGE wait outside and standing room only. I can see why this place was featured on Diners, Drive In's and Dives with Guy Fieri. I seriously just have to go back now and stick with the plan to taste what he highlighted on that show! http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/barrio-cafes-cochinita-pibil-0206541.html Barrio Cafe is a perfect place for the senses of taste, smell and to the artful eye!"}
{"text":"Wow, people either love or hate this place. I'm a lover. I look for the best in things. Positive outlook. All that... If you go when they're super busy, which they often are, service isn't going to be the best you've ever had. But it's always been good. I went last week for a late lunch and the server and the Chef sat down at my table with me to discuss vegan options. It probably was the best service I've ever had. Three menu options you should try: the guac. Just try it. They queso fundido is probably my favorite menu item at any restaurant. I dream about it. And their jack-based sangria. Mmmmm. On busy nights be prepared to wait for a table. For a long time."}
{"text":"Very average. Nothing we ate was outstanding and my water sat empty for over 30 minutes. I cannot recommend nor can I say it was bad - just super average."}
{"text":"The food here is good but wayyyyyy overpriced. Talk about gouging your prices. I had the black mole enchiladas they were good just like we make at home but really 20.00 for this plate of tortilla chicken and mole sauce is just ridiculous. It also came with a side of veggies that lacked flavor and a pico that was forgettable.   I didn't even bother eating the pico or the vegetables. My daughter had the carne Asada tacos nothing special. My husband had the crepa de chorizo and he said it was nothing special.  I don't recommend this place  the food is good but with the price ....I left this place feeling taken advantage of.  I won't be back but at least I tried a new place....."}
{"text":"Barrio raises the bar.  I feel...like every other place that I gave 5 stars should be knocked down a star. This is what real 5 stars is.   I don't know what I liked better: the service, my enchiladas, my margaritas, or my churros. I'm totally serious.  I loved this place.  Holy hell. Could you imagine if this place was closer to me? I'd be broke as a joke and obese.  I loved this place. I don't know what else to say about that."}
{"text":"The enchiladas were good and the guacamole was even better.  It's a little too noisy for my taste; it's hard to have a normal conversation.  I will try it again next time I'm in the barrio (neighborhood)."}
{"text":"I was looking to grab some tacos one night. I checked out Yelp and found that this place was in walking distance from my home and the reviews were great! Oh yeah, taco time!   For some reason I didn't check out the menu or attire before heading over there so I was a bit surprised when I walked in with my Vans on and a baseball cap.  Oops, my bad. Everyone was dressed in their nice evening wear and I looked like I was ready to hop on my bicycle and cruise around the block.  That being said, I was greeted and seated with a smile! I ordered a delicious margarita on the rocks and picked out one of the many tequilas on the shelf. Oh my! It's scary I live so close to a place that has my favorite drink.  The food, oh my, the FOOD! Class act.  When I said I was looking for tacos I wasn't expecting this place AT ALL. This is not your corner taco stand with sloppy beans and dry rice...this is gourmet Mexican food.   Even though I wanted tacos when the night started I had to splurge, because I was there. I ordered the The Pescado del Mar which included shrimp, lobster, halibut and scallops. Just a few of my favorite things. Being from New England I totally appreciated how the plate was cooked, if it wasn't cooked right you would hear it. The lobster and scallops were cooked perfectly and there was plenty of everything on there.  My friend ordered the Chile Relleno, she loved it.  Bottom line is this place is in an area you would expect to find some good cheap authentic tacos but what you get is some beautiful, delicious food and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend that you head on out to Barrio."}
{"text":"Wandered into this little gem by accident Friday night. Ordered the Chile Nogales made famous on Guy Fieri's segment called Diners and Drive ins and Dives. I wasn't expecting Michelin food in a little cafe but was pleasantly surprised by the signature dish that put this place on the map of must eat culinary gems. Fiance ordered the chicken poblano whose sauce was so good we soaked the bread in it and polished off the basket. Will be back to try other offerings on the menu"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have ever written a review.  My husband and I went to Barrio Cafe last night. The service was efficient and pleasant, but the margarita and the food was super mediocre. I guess that the biggest reason I jumped in to comment was the $19 margarita. First, the drink was awful. Really acidic, but with almost no flavor. My husband ordered one too and immediately just stopped drinking his and ordered a beer because \"they won't be able to screw that up\". I tried to salvage mine with a floater of chamborg ($9). It was better, but $19?   $12 for a bowl of corn chowder that had one lonely and awkwardly floating shrimp in there. My husband and I both agreed that it had a familiar taste and consistency,  but couldn't put our finger on it, until I shouted \"cream of wheat\". That was it, a bowl of near tasteless gruel at almost a room temperature. We couldn't figure out if it was a hot soup or supposed to be cold and sat too long.    The queso fundido was the other app. nothing to complain about, but not great.   We both ordered tacos (because they were out of the pork dish they are known for at 6 pm). The tacos were super mediocre. Again ... three little street tacos on greased corn tortillas. I had shrimp which was tasty enough. My husband had steak. His lacked any real flavor.   The spicy fries served with the meal was the best part. Also, I thought that the chips were good and the salsa was amazing.   I am always looking for great spots and this most definitely was not it.  $100 later ... NOT impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The lady brought us 4 tacos because we wanted to split, even though it was \"against the rules.\"  Perfect atmosphere for having a mexican beer as well. Dim lighting and tight knit, so maybe leave the kids at home. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix. Hands down the best upscale Mexican food establishment here. It's a little pricey for Mexican food, but it is upscale. To be honest I used to think that all Mexican food was some combination of the same ingredients over and over again, but Barrio proves that there are other good quality Mexican dishes. Keep doing what your doing Barrio, I will return."}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, I used to come to Barrio at least once a week.  I didn't eat every time, though.  I couldn't.  I would ruin my taste for anything I made for myself at home.  The only issue I had with Barrio was the lack of space.  I literally had to shout to get my voice over the roar of the crowd.  Everything is packed so tight, I had to dodge waiters with trays and other customers coming and going while attempting to eat without turning myself into a cyclops with the fork.  When it's too crowded, I would often sedate myself with a tasty sangria from the bar.  But heaven forfend if you'd like to sit there.  Nope, there just happens to be at least 15 people packed into a 4' by 10' space, waiting for tables.  The food and drink is delicious, but I took away 1 star for feeling like I was in a NYC bar in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chicken Mole in town, would be 5 stars but I feel it's a tad bit over priced. Took my inlaws here for their first time and they had a great time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We drove in from LA on a moving job and came straight here for lunch. I had been wanting to try it after seeing the chef and the restaurant featured on a few tv shows. The food was amazing, our waiter was great. It lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Came here from California to check out EL BARRIO from Guy Fiere's review, great service, GREAT MUSIC and GREAT FOOD - Chile en Nogada was excellent as well as the Cochinita Pibil!! And then for dessert the Churros Rellenos was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 Decor: 4 Ambiance: 4.5 Service: 4 Value: 4  Awesome visit with good happy hour deals on food and drinks."}
{"text":"Exquisite food, creative and delicious. Horchata Heaven .......... the best. They serve in a coke bottle just like home in Guatemala ...... or so I think. This place gets Packed ..... and the crowd forms early. I look forward to going back again and again. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I cant say that I am impressed, but for Phoenix, id have to say I enjoyed it. Since I got pregnant all Ive wanted was mexican food. Okay, more like the delicious burritos I used to eat in the bay area when I lived there, but still, I wanted mexican food. So, I settled for some tacos and barrio had some yummy sounding tacos.  I had high expectations and maybe that was one of my problems. Although I gave it four stars, I have to say it is just because it is here in Phoenix that it got four stars. If it was in the bay area, it may have only gotten two. But here in phoenix it is hard to get decent food, and I have to say if I need tacos again while I am here I will go back to barrio to get them. Wishing all the while I lived in the bay area again, but thats besides the point.  So my brother and I pretty much knew what we wanted when we got here. We waited outside with our dad and his girfriend for an hour before the restaurant opened for dinner.   to drink- wanted a margherita but couldnt order one damnit- got the hibiscus drink. very tasty. tangy and refreshing. heard the margherita was good from my brother and the beers my father had were refreshing for him as well.  I wanted to try the lobster quesadilla for an app and so ordered that. my father ordered the queso fundido.  I was disappointed in the quesadilla- kinda cold and not much substance, especially for the price. BUT I was impressed with the queso dip. SO yummy I couldnt stop eating it. slightly spicy and very cheesy. mmmm. loved it. tho there were a few stale tasting chips which were kinda offputting, no one else seemed to notice. guess I got em all.  For entrees, though I was halfway through the dip and getting fuller as each second passed, I decided to stick with what I originally wanted to order, as did my brother. I had read earlier that the portions were small- well that is not so. each taco plate came with four tacos. and some with fries. fries? yuck. had to pass. but the tacos!...  I ordered the shrimp tacos- so fabulous so glad I ordered them- and the chicken tacos that were not on the online menu and made me change my mind from steak to chicken- were yummy yet was sooo full didnt really enjoy them till I ate the leftovers the next day. My brother orederd the pork tacos- extremely tasty if I do say so myself- and the filet mignon torta- which wasnt what he expected and I myself couldnt really stomach (meat was a little on the sweet side and way too much bread.) dont know or care what my dad's girfriend got.  my dad got the chile relleno which he seemed to enjoy but complained it didnt have all the shellfish in it that it mentioned, a couple shrimp but no scallops. i think he wasnt impressed after waiting an hour to eat here.  overall it was satisfying. although completely overstuffed when I left, I will know better next time. dip for appetizer and ONE taco plate."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas eve, eve with my family who lives in Phoenix and we live in Tucson.  The murals were cool in the back of the place. Inside the place is cramped and the chairs uncomfortable. The artwork was fun to look at on the walls. We open the menus and the prices were outrageous for this place. My wife and I decided to split the chicken mole entree. Chicken was drowned in Mole sauce that was not good at all.  We both agreed the best part was the guacamole but how hard is it to add pomegranate seeds to sliced avocado. The service felt rushed and 3 times I had to tell the busboy I was not finished with my meal yet. The best part of the meal was the dessert. 4 people with 3 sangrias and the total bill was $120 with tip. I recommend not to go to this place."}
{"text":"Chef Silvana is renowned as one of the top Mexican Chefs in the country, and it's for a reason, this restaurant. It should be on everyone's \"Must-Try\" list, and the one item above all (everything is delicious) is the Cochinita Pibi; their pork is marinated in achiote and sour  orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted over night, topped with pickled red onion   and Yucatán-style pico de gallo, paired with pretty much any of their amazing Maragitas. It's unlike anything you've ever had, and in my top 3 favorite all-time dishes. You won't have any trouble finding the place, as it is covered with murals from local artists, depicting Mexican heritage and culture, with vibrant colors. Much of that can be found on the inside of the restaurant, transferred into food, with various flavors, colors, and options. Be sure to check out some of Chef Silvana's other restaurants, including Barrio Urbano, Barrio Avion (inside Phoenix International Airport) and her newest installment, Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva."}
{"text":"FIRST TIMERS here. We received a gift certificate for X-mas and decided to use it on V-day. It's down town Phx, you have to park in the back, beautiful paint on the outside wall as you come in. Great street side presentation. The inside is not much to write about, but the food speaks VOLUMES.  Michalita is what we started with, spicy bloody mary mix and a beer mixed in. Never had one, I think I will start drinking them every hangover now.....they were that good. Started with the ELOTE buttered corn, cilantro, oxoana cheese and spicy cream on top.....blew my mind. I could eat an entire bucket of this. I had the Suizas enchiladas.....again.  Awesome.......best I've ever had. My wife had the Taco's de conchinita pibil tacos........she loved every bite of it!!  I really like how they didn't throw down a bowl of tortilla chips and salsa on the table instead, it was warm bread and an olive tapenade.  As we walked out, you know why all the praise this place gets. It's a great Phoenix staple. A must stop."}
{"text":"This restaurant is small, located in the barrio, and has a menu full of latin fusion dishes.  My DH and I were in PHX for our anniversary and were looking for an authentic sort of down home place and stumbled upon Barrio Cafe.  We went in, sat down, had some extremely salty bruschetta with bread and ordered.  I ordered the chicken poblano torta and my DH ordered the filet torta.  The portions are huge, however, so is the price tag.  Overall, my torta was big enough for 2, lacked flavor, was sloppily composed and not what I expected.  For almost $50 including tip, we should've drove further down the street and found somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food EVER! Authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Please keep the Chile vegano on your menu forever!!! I cannot wait to get back to Phoenix to visit again! Sooooo delish!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find! I was in town for the weekend and my friend took me here for what was to be an unforgettable meal. This place is rather unassuming among all the other establishments on the street but do not let that deter you! Something I have always loved about traveling is enjoying how chefs will mix the local cuisine and their cooking pedigree. This place surely was a melting pot of that idea!  We came for an early Friday evening dinner and the place was already picking up. A good sign that this place is popular. The decor inside was eclectic and it is not a big restaurant by any means but it really works for this place.  For an appetizer, please get the table side guacamole. As a midwesterner who spent a lot of time on the West Coast growing up, you don't realize how great fresh the avocados are until you leave the West. It was so good here, and the pomegranates were definitely the reason why!  I ordered the Pollo Poblano which did not disappoint! The chicken was moist and tender and the pine nuts in the dish really stood out to me! The cheese on it was also extremely fresh and I just loved the dish so much i ate the entire thing in one sitting! This very easily could have been two meals.  For dessert, we ordered the Churros which were amazing! The ice cream it came with also perfect as well as the caramel sauce it came in! Whenever I come back to Phoenix, I am going to this place!"}
{"text":"Great 1.50 tacos for happy hour, they give you the chance to try their different kinds of meat. I really enjoyed the cochinito pibil, mojo shrimp, and carne asada tacos, I thought these were the best. The duck tacos were good if you like a sweet sauce with tacos. And the chorizo taco were good also if you enjoy chorizo.  Also tried the sangria and michelada with negro modelo which were excellent.  Lastly we had the crepes for dessert. While I'm not much of a desserts person, this was really tasty with the amount of cajeta (caramelized milk) and vanilla bean ice cream."}
{"text":"WOW.this fine establishment did not let me down one bit.i came in by myself just out of sheer curiosity and the reputation it has.\"good\" and man o man was impressed .the hostess greeted me and sat me ASAP .my server was right on top if my orders and guided me perfectly threw the menu as I was a first timer and made that clear for a better experience,which I suggest.i got the pescado tres tacos with a sangria .very delicious and a healthy amount.the overall decor of the place makes you feel at ease and has alot of local art up for sale.when I was finished and laying the owner/chef came out and greeted me and I thanked her very much and she bought me a shot of the finest tequila they had as well as another customer.what can I say other than perfect.i will devour that whole menu.see ya soon ladies.stay classy yelpers"}
{"text":"I came here per recommendations of diners drive-ins and dives and this is place way surpassed my expectations.  We got the pozole and the chile de nogadas. Both were amazing.  The flavors were so rich and complex.  Also the drinks are unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Followed the advice of Guy Fierri and stopped in to try before the Cleveland Indians took care of business at Chase Field. I had the shrimp tacos, hubby had fish tacos and kids had Carne quesadillas. Everything was fresh and yummy. Everyone is full and happy! Thank you for everything! Drove 5 hours from Vegas, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nahh. This is over hyped by media!  I am not going into too much with this place cause it's not even worth the effort. Plain and simple it sucked. I lived in Mexico for years and this is not very good and the prices suck!  I was not impressed with anything. The famous guacamole, big whoop. So you put pomegranate seeds in it. WOW! Genius!  I would never return. I had better...much better!"}
{"text":"I just read the last review by Mike and I want to second his comment about the defects of Barrio. The prices are definitely higher than what I am used to for dinner and the portions could be seen as small. We went after having some chips and guacamole as snacks at my house knowing the wait for a table would be over an hour (we were warned ahead of time by several people that we would have to wait, especially on a Saturday night). We sat outside on some benches and watched as three groups of people came and left due to the wait. We were seated in less time that quoted which is always a nice surprise. The waiter was very busy with all of his tables and we felt that he could have used some help. The fresh guacamole we ordered was supposed to be made at the table, but because we were seated in a corner surrounded by other tables, he made it in front of the other tables and brought it to us. That was very disappointing as I felt he really did not make an effort to provide us with the entertainment that the guacamole making provides. The food arrived in the expected time and was just right to eat. Each of us ordered a different taco plate and shared the meal which was fun to get to sample each meat. I ordered the pork knowing that it was delicious and I was very satisfied by the texture and flavor. I recommend that dish for anyone who goes to the Cafe. We finished the meal with a shared portion of the churro and ice cream dessert. Very satisfying. I will go back again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to eat at Barrios based on seeing it on MSN top taco place for Phoenix as well as all the Yelp reviews.  Don't get me wrong, the food was very good as well as the service. However, for some reason I was expecting a fun, little hole in the wall place with corresponding hole in the wall prices. Nope, this was definitely a semi-hipster cool hole in the wall place with pricey hipster prices. So my four stars for food quality is diminished a trifle for the prices.  A $12 margarita is a little expensive for me."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here last night. We had been wanting to try it for a while & finally were in the neighborhood and had time. Even though it was a busy night, we were seated relatively fast  (about 10 minutes). I had fish tacos & she had Enchiladas de Mole. Both were decent but I do not feel they were worth the price - our total bill came out to be $60 for two people. While I believe that this place has great customer service, I think it is too pricey for me! Also, the place was VERY loud. There was a few times that my friend & I would have to yell across the (small) table to be able to hear each other."}
{"text":"Four locals recommended this little gem. I had no idea what I was getting myself into until I realized this little gem jam packed with power taste! Lol  The outside of it is graffiti all around the building. Some pretty cool drawings too. I walked in and someone was singing Spanish ballads. Beautiful voice and went perfect with my dinner. My waitress was very helpful and I'm pretty sure she knew I wasn't a local because I asked the how spicy was their mild lol anyways I got guacamole and chips to start off with. I mean why not! This place looks authentic! And it did not disappoint!!  The guacamole was incredible, it was sweet and salty and limey (not a word). It was everything I never dream of. Then the shrimp tacos and spicy fries were even better. It was fresh, it had spice and it was worth the drive. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Outrageous prices for fair-to-middling food. The only thing that stood out was the handmade guacamole. Terrible, high prices for nothing but a mediocre tasting food. I don't recommend this shop to anyone, can't understand how they keep busy. To boot, the waiter managed to offend both myself and my date with his impertinent comments about white people in a Mexican restaurant. Really?"}
{"text":"Absolutely stood up to expectations. Cochinita pibil tacos were amazing.  The guacamole was rough chopped but really well balanced amongnst all ingredients. Kids were both pleased with their orders as well.  Cool, small space.  I can definitely see how this place could get packed in a hurry.  That said, I would wait in line!"}
{"text":"Food good over priced, margaritas over rated. Tried it out due to distinction of best margaritas in Phoenix. Disapointing, if this is true, then Phoenix doesnt offer a solid margarita. Shrimp taco was very tasty though"}
{"text":"Love their artwork placed all over the restaurant, inside and outside. Would come back just to admire it.   Their guacamole with pomegranate seeds was very interesting as a salsa. I had their Enchilada Suiza, which was delicious. For dessert, their Churro Relleno was a satisfying finish to dinner."}
{"text":"This place is ah-mazing! We shared the most popular pork dish, a steak dish and a fish item, and everything was so incredibly good I could eat here all day, every day! Understandably, we had a long wait, but we killed time with guac and chips and drinks. I really wanted the churro dessert, but we were so stuffed that we just couldn't. I would recommend this place to everyone. Just go. GO!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately can't give 0 stars after having just left there with horrible service.  We arrived at 4:15. Never came back after giving us our menus. Several people walked by and never asked how we were doing, including the hostess who seated us and didn't bother to notice that after being there for 15 minutes we didn't have any water.  Walked out at 4:35 and the hostess told us thank you have a nice day. Um don't you know we just arrived and are now leaving?"}
{"text":"So I was out in the field calling on clients with my manager when lunch rolled around and we were struggling to think of someplace we'd both like, I remembered Barrio Café from seeing it the night before on Diners, Drive-Inns and Dives so viola!  Loved the atmosphere and the parking in the rear, provided a nice urban feel too often lacking among Phoenix's stucco-covered strip mall restaurants.  Service was good.  I had the pulled pork tacos, the boss had the carne asada tacos.  He felt his were \"good, but not great\".  I thought the pulled pork was excellent.  Unlike most \"street\" taco plates, these were fully stuffed with excellent pork.  The sauces on the side were terrific and unique as well.    I'm a fan and I'll be back.  There are some unique dishes that I still want to try.  The menu certainly isn't your typical Mexican fare.  The only draw-back that I saw would be the prices.  They're certainly proud of their menu, perhaps a little more than is warranted in my view."}
{"text":"This place is a local favorite.  People rave about it.  I just left unimpressed.  The food didn't really do it for me.  It wasn't bad, just not my palette.  The dining area felt over crowded and underwhelming.  Maybe the hype ruined it for me and my expectations were too high coming in?"}
{"text":"This ain't Tex-Mex. This ain't Americanized Mex. This is authentic Mex-Mex. We knew from the first bite of complementary salsa and chips that this was going to be in an out of this world meal. I went with one of the house specialties - Pollo Poblano. It was a generous portion of panseared chicken breast, moist and flavorful, with an incredible tomatillo buerre blanc sauce that honestly made me want to lick the plate. The hubs enjoyed the acclaimed pork tacos, Cochinita Pibil, which featured a subtle complexity of flavors that was truly enjoyable... the kind of taste sensation that makes you rave after each bite. They have a great selection of Mexican beers, but the highlight of my night was the organic margarita recommended by our server. Unlike those coyingly  sweet/sour concoctions you often find passed off as margaritas, this one featured fresh citrus juices and the notable kick of a top-quality tequila. One was enough! Make sure to check out the fantastic murals out back!"}
{"text":"Pros- tasty  Cons- location, overpriced, noisy."}
{"text":"Perhaps I do not know what \"authentic Mexican food\" tastes like but I do know what great food tastes like and this place has it! The guacamole is so good and unique... I have never had guacamole with pomegranate but Wow!  Also had the Carne Asada tacos which can be shared- there are 4 small but flavorful tacos with a good sized salad.  Small place with slightly hip decor, the service is also very attentive. When I fly into Phoenix, I will for sure hit this place... It's 10 minutes away and so worth it!"}
{"text":"Our food was delicious, so we're the margaritas and our dessert! There are tons of murals surrounding the building which is amazing; it is part of the chef's Calle 16 project-very cool.  We got there at 4:30 on a Saturday trying to beat the dinner rush since the place is so small and parking is limited and it worked out perfectly. Service was fast and our waiter made sure to get all our drink orders in before happy hour. My husband is super picky about pork dishes, since he smokes his own and he truly loved the Conchinita Pibil, they give you a ton of pork and it's so well seasoned and full of flavor. I had the Enchiladas Del Mar which was EXACTLY what I've been looking for, best version I've had in the valley! Actually had real crab meat instead of imitation, large shrimp and baby scallops. And it was drowning in cheese, my kind of situation.  for desert we had the the Pastel de Chocolate, and it was goooood. Comes out warm and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and has a subtle cinnamon and almond taste. Overall, does seem just a little bit overpriced, and our margaritas for the size could have been stronger (but we also got 2 for 1 so can't complain too much) but we will be back and might be one of my favorite restaurants now!"}
{"text":"Heard tons of good things. Love the decor. Brunch left me wanting for more. The coffee was excellent, but my food sadly was not."}
{"text":"As Chuck D would say \"Don't Believe The Hype\"....  Had high expectation after seeing this on Triple D, but after venturing into the barrio for some Latin flavor, I wished I'd stopped at Taco Bell instead. At least there would have been flavor to my meal...  The best thing about this place is the artwork on the building. Do yourself a favor and hit the Taco street truck on the corner for a real street taco experiance for $5 verse $ 13 for this epic failure of a joint."}
{"text":"Perfect place for what I consider an authentic Mexican meal.  Fun decor, too.  Bloody Maria's are delish!  A great place for out of town visitors."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix I was looking for a really good and authentic Mexican food place and was thoroughly  pleased when I found the Barrio Cafe'. The food is extremely fresh and flavorful. I understand why this place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. The atmosphere felt very humble and welcoming as well. The only reason for the 4 stars is that the service could've have been little better.  The place was very quiet and unfortunately the waitress was not as attentive as I would've hoped. Regardless this place is great and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Always a treat to get back to Barrio. Looks like they've painted some fun murals on the walls in the back parking lot. Feels a little less like we'll get mugged back there heh. Barrio is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. You'll probably read a lot of people giving it bad ratings because they didn't get rice and beans with their entree, chips and salsa before hand, and saying ridiculous things like how much better La Parilla Suiza is lol. So if you go and you aren't familiar with authentic southern mexican cuisine, just understand that you aren't going to Macayos.  Started off last night with the Queso Fundido. It's the only reason my review isn't getting 5 stars. (well, that and what I consider lackluster but competent service) First time I've ever had anything there that I didn't think was just amazing. It really fell flat and didn't have a lot of flavor. Other appetizers we've had there were out of this world so this one was extra disappointing. My wife and I both hand margaritas which were great. They have pretty much every type of tequila known to man there also.  For the entrees, I had the pork tacos. As I was eating them I told my wife that they were the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life. She had one of the quesadillas and loved it also.  Highly recommend Barrio. Like I said, it's the best Mexican in the city imo, and the tableside quac there is the best you'll ever have."}
{"text":"So I saw this place on diner drive-ins and dive and i was like wow thats look interesting but boy was I wrong please don't come here it's terrible It was so bad that as soon as I got my food I refuse to eat it and I was starving and I'm a big guy so believe me even if the food isn't that good I'll still eat it the building is super small and cramped the service is terrible, the food was cold and worst of all it was super expensive"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - small restaurant with great local art on the walls (that constantly changes).  Fast service - once you get a table.  I almost always go during the week, because it's quieter and you get seated quickly.  The food is Southern Mexican, which means it has a more subtle spice, very flavorful, and isn't overloaded with cheese.  (Yay!)  Guacamole is delicious.  There isn't a lot I can eat (I'm a lactose intolerant pescatarian) and they took my favourite dish off the menu (the pescado veracruzano... it was truly amazing), but I go for experience.  I usually get the shrimp or fish tacos, which are great.  Sometimes I get the tilapia wrapped in a banana leaf, but it's a little pricey.   Great restaurant for small groups.  I would come more often, but their menu hasn't changed much over the last 5 years and I wish it would.  Barrio has received well-deserved lavish praise for years and now it kind of feels like it's just coasting.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both the downtown and airport venues. If you like Mexican food you'll love this place. If you don't like Mexican food, you will after you eat here."}
{"text":"good food. Guac was great. service was friendly. will go back but likely won't get the chicken mole dish again, as chicken was a little over cooked. Fish platter type dish was great though. Had lobster appetizer that was great. parking was easier than I thought. Got there early, around 430 or 5 on a sunday so it wasn't crowded, but got that way by the time we left. Churro dessert was to die for and would go back for JUST that."}
{"text":"This place has OK food but really bad customer service.  I got the fish tacos they where all right.  The waiter was rude when he asked if we wanted the check he said ill bring that and a police officer too.  I asked what he meant by that he was is just a joke.  Not a very good joke to me.  Oh and they add a 15 dollar gratuity tip when they dont even deserve it."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix arguably one of my favorite spots overall. The house made pomegranate guacamole is a must order every time. I love the enchilada's suizas but have tried several dishes all are fabulous. They have a great tequila selection and their margaritas are so fresh and delicious. Don't be discouraged by the location or the building itself (it isn't located in the best part of town) the staff is great and the food makes it worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"If I could describe Barrio Cafe in one word it would be OVERPRICED. I told the bartender I wanted a margarita but not too sweet and he suggested the lowrider. The margarita was expensive but it was strong and one of the best I have ever had. It didn't bug me that they served bread and tapenade instead of chips and salsa. I found the change refreshing and the tapenade was delish! We ordered guacamole while we decided what we wanted to eat. I didn't like the pomegranates in the guacamole and I had to salt it up a bit. We also ordered some fundido dip that was almost cold when we dipped into it. We asked for them to reheat it and I noticed they guy sitting next to us sent back his seafood dish for the same reason.....wasn't cooked well enough. You shouldn't be having these problems when you are paying an arm and a leg for your meal. I ordered the surf and turf for $46 dollars. It came with filet mignon topped with chorizo and goat cheese on top of mashed potatoes and a lobster tail. It was good but they undercooked my steak and the lobster tail didn't taste like it was as fresh as the waiter described. He said they fly in the seafood fresh daily. Even though the food is really good it is way overpriced. I would rather eat at Gallo Blanco for half the price."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I LOVED IT! This time.... not so much.  We had awful awful awful service. Our server was slow, forgetful, and snotty.  YUCK.  I like the pomegranate seeds in the guacamole. I ordered the enchiladas suizas, and I found them to be oddly sweet and the chicken was chewy and tough inside.  I think this place has outlived it's useful lifespan."}
{"text":"Finally, I have had the chance to try this place! After seeing it on Guy Fieri's show, the boyfriend and I decided to check it out for NYE.   Not a fan of the neighborhood. However it looks like they are expanding to the building next door, and the exterior is very welcoming. On this particular night they were packed, but had a live (small) band jammed into the front.  Now, the food. Oh my god it was good. I Had the Pollo Poblano and highly HIGHLY reckons getting that. It's got this delicious goat cheese/cream cheese/ sour cream mixture of amazing on top of poblano peppers and juicy chicken. With a cream sauce and pine nuts, I was done.   My boyfriend had the famous pork. (Cochinita pibil?) it was amazing as well, he cleared his entire plate. Super tender and juicy. Yummmmmmmmm.    We had the guac as well, since it was rated best in Phoenix, however I didn't think it was the absolute best I'd ever had. Our waiter was pretty rushed as well so there were big chunks of guacamole too. Meh.    Otherwise, it's a must to go here. We will definitely be back when our leftovers are gone!"}
{"text":"The service is good, the food is unique and it's close to my job for lunch. I take all my clients there and they always want to go back. For being in the ghetto the Barrio Cafe is great..... Thanks!"}
{"text":"What can I say.....probably the BEST Mexican food I have had in years ! I had the Enchilada Suizas and it knocked my socks off. The first bite was heaven. The portion was just right and every forkful was a treat. The restaurant itself is mostly white with artist paintings hanging from the wall, but the outside is colorfully painted and a treat all by itself. The wait staff is great, friendly, cheerful and seem to be having a great time waiting/assisting the eager customers.  Looking around at what the other patrons were having made one want to stay and try a great number of dishes, everything looked like you wanted to go over and say, \"Excuse me, can I have a bite of that ?\". And there was no waiting for food, although the place as about 3/4 full, the order arrived within 10 minutes, barely enough time to sip a Margarita. So, as you can tell, I loved the place, and will return."}
{"text":"Everything great you have heard about this restauraunt is true. From the food and drinks to the service, it is all amazing. I have had quite a few things on the menu and it has all been outstanding. Get the guac! Seriously, get the guac."}
{"text":"Came here for a second time and got the shrimp quesadillas instead of the tacos, which I regret -- I stupidly didn't translate the description, and didn't realize how much goat cheese there'd be. Still liked it, but I liked the tacos a lot more.  The guac was still incredible. Keeping my rating the same."}
{"text":"I just have to say that I've been here three times since my first post and I can comfortably say that this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.   Guac, margs, and aesthetic...top notch when compared to the rest of what the city has to offer.   (but I am always up for suggestions on places that could rival my love for Barrio!)"}
{"text":"Super whoa! Freaking love this place. I live in Mexico and Barrio is the real deal. Love their cocktails also. Yummmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on The Food Network's Diners Driveins and Dives and it looked so amazing I had to put it on the list for my next Phoenix trip, and I wasn't disappointed. The host, Guy, seemed pretty smitten with this place, and I can't say I blame him.  The outside of the restaurant is covered with awesome graffiti style art, literary on all sides. The inside has a hip vibe to it and is broken into several small rooms with tables. We were seated right away on Saturday at lunch over a holiday weekend. Our server was with us quickly and was very nice and accommodating. He had no problem pointing out the couple things on the menu I should avoid, to stay away from da glutzen, but mostly everything else was gluten free.   We ordered the guacamole which was amazing and the unexpected pomegranate seeds added a nice sweet yet tangy component. I had seen a couple of their especialidades de casa featured on the show and it was the tilapia that made me decide that this place needed to make the top of my nom list. The Mojarra San Augustin was amazing. A piece of seasoned tilapia on a bed of the family recipe achiote and wrapped in a banana leaf. It was perfect. My friend had the spinach salad with pecans and golden raisins. She loved the spicy yet sweet dressing but wished she'd had more options as a vegetarian. I'm not sure what my other friends ordered, they are regulars here and love it.  Overall, wish I was still in the Phoenix area so I could explore this menu more. It has a great atmosphere, food quality is excellent, price is reasonable and service was good. Definitely recommend trying it out, Guy wouldn't steer ya wrong."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant four stars as it is the first time I've been there and until I go a second time I can't give it a five. My wife and I went here for lunch. Service was above par. They were attentive, kind and knowledgeable. The food was very good and packed with flavor. We had the suisa and we split a carne taco plate. Both dishes were very tasty. The prices match the quality of the food. That being said it is pricier for lunch. We spent $40 for two of us for lunch and did not have sodas or dessert.  In the not as great side of the table, I was looking for standard chips and salsa but they do not provide that like most Mexican restaurants.  Instead the offer bread and olives.  This was my least favorite part of the meal.   Final word, this is a very good restaurant. Its good for business lunches and dinners. I am excited to go back soon and give it a fifth star."}
{"text":"I been trying to get a table at this restaurant forever, but finally my wife and I had a chance today for lunch. Well we started with the guacamole and let me tell it was fresh well balance definitely one of the best guacamole I ever had, the pomegranate is the extra wow factor!! For entree my wife had the mole enchiladas it was good but we had better she tried both mole red and black but it wasn't the best one, I had the chile en ahogada that entree was really good every bit was enjoyable but it had a bit too much creamy sauce but you don't have to eat it its around the chile. Service was good and friendly. Even though I been waiting forever to go to this restaurant I wasn't that impressed"}
{"text":"Five stars for the chef, The bartender, five more. And five for the mezuzah hanging next to the door.  No, I'm not Jewish But know of their ways. So as long as I'm here I'm out of harm's way.  So I drink your tequila all one hundred brands till you ask me to leave then mezuzah be damned.  I'm now in harm's way No mezuzah, unsafe. And what of St. Christopher who hangs from my neck? Well where was he only moments ago when I stood up too fast  and back down I did go?  So they pack up my pork and my chips and my bread to send me off packing where soon I'll find dread from tequila and pork, and guacamole with berries. And from this girl at the bar who I now know is married.  Barrio, I dedicate this plagiarized passage to your 120 brands of tequila.  Tequila, scorpion honey, harsh dew of the doglands, essence of Aztec, crema de cacti; tequila, oily and thermal like the sun in solution; tequila, liquid geometry of passion; Tequila, the buzzard god who copulates in mid-air with the ascending souls of dying virgins; tequila, firebug in the house of good taste; O tequila, savage water of sorcery, what confusion and mischief your sly, rebellious drops do generate! Without doubt, it was the tequila that made Bernard impatient, that befuddled him into mistaking the UFO conference for the Geo-Therapy Care Fest.\"  Oh please let me in I promise to be good. Not tell dirty jokes Or make fun of your hood As I sit at the bar  and play nice, oh I will. Eating all of my food as I lay off the swill.  WIth love."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe has been around for quite a while now, and has a truly unique cuisine. I first found out about it because they hired me as a musician, years ago! The last time I was there was several months back. It's Mexican food, but not chimichangas and burritos, more like moles and nice sit-down food with traditional flavors and authentic combinations. I feel like I'm in a different country at the Barrio; it's exotic and not cookie cutter in the least. Very cool place."}
{"text":"We went on a very busy Friday night.  Crazy busy, but a fun atmosphere, \"real\" people, and great energy.  We have an excellent margarita while waiting.  There's a local band playing music- and they are very good.  We are seated after about 35 minutes.  We are under speaker so the music is so loud we can't talk.  Service staff is very friendly and professional, but also very busy.  Excellent bread and olive dip is delivered.    We order pork tacos and Pollo Poblano dinners.  Our food is prepared well.  Quality is excellent.  But our water glasses are empty for far too long, too often.  It was loud to a fault- likely a combo of acoustics, voices and speaker location.  I like me my loud music, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation at dinner.  The patrons as a whole appeared to be enjoying themselves.  There is a broad cross-section of people, variety of ages, ethnicities, friends, couples, groups, etc.  I enjoy a diverse crowd, and everyone was good-natured, which adds to the charm of this small and very busy restaurant.  Parking is tight but i've never experienced any damage in the back.     I've been a couple times before, and consistently experience a 4 or 5 rating experience.  This is the first time I've reviewed, and wish I could give a 5-star, but no-go.    Yes I will return, but not during one of the busiest times of the week.  No reservations, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe serves up nontraditional Mexican.  Okay. So some have complained this place does not offer traditional Mexican food. If you are looking for Taco Bell or Del Taco style fixings consider going elsewhere. But if you're looking for a cool and new twist on Mexican flavors this could be your spot.  The service here was quick and attentive. The busboy was fast to bring a basket of bread and an amazing olive spread (pictured.)  The flavors of the spread were pungent enough to be memorable yet not overpowering.  A side salad (pictured) was included with my lunch. It had a flavorful mixture of Roquefort cheese, dried cranberries, spinach and salsa. It would have been perfection had it not been for the too-spicy balsamic vinaigrette dressing which nearly disguised all the other flavors.  The Torta de Filetito (pictured) was my entree. The first decision I had to make was how to tackle it. It was piled too high to eat as a sandwich, yet trying to slice through the crusty bread (even with a steak knife) proved to be nearly impossible.  The fillet mignon was flavorful, though could have been a bit more tender. It was also to have included chorizo though I found no sign anywhere...or could it have simply had no flavor and been mistaken for the chipotle wine sauce???  The portion size was more than ample though many pictures of the same entree on yelp.com display this entrée with french fries. I did not see french fries on the menu nor were they presented on the plate. Could this have been what the restaurant considers a \"lunch portion\" or was it nearly forgotten?  A few tweaks and this place could be a five-star restaurant, in my opinion. I realize that space is at a premium though I personally do not care for the unisex restrooms. (One of the two was out of order, but this is the norm here anyway.). I may try this place a second time someday and if I do I think I'd like to try their margaritas."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  My friend's main course was cold which caused the mole to look like solid chocolate with white chocolate drizzle.   The inside was cold as well and since it was her first time she assumed this was correct.  She didn't want to cause a fuss, but requested we not come back again.  My halibut was cooked, but flavorless as was the rest of the shrimp.  The flavors hadn't been infused as would have occurred if marinated.  My dish was lukewarm and I knew I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so I was excited to take my family today to try it out. First, our waiter, Cesar, wasn't too friendly and had attitude when we were asking questions about the menu. We were surprised to get bread and diced olives instead of the typical chips and salsa. When our drinks came out, we were disappointed in seeing the size of them. You pay $5 for a soda and expect larger sizes and free refills. My niece ordered juice and got the wrong one so we had to ask the waiter to replace it. We were hungry and waited nearly an hour for our food. Then, when our dishes came out they weren't what we asked for. We ordered the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs but they were sunny-side up when the dishes were brought to our table. Portions weren't too bad but expected more for the prices, no beans and rice! My niece and nephew ordered the chicken enchiladas but they had very little cheese on them. The kids left most of their food as it was mainly tortillas covered in sauce with a few pieces of chicken. As if that wasn't bad enough, for 3 adults, 2 children and 4 month infant we were charged a 20% gratuity. Needless to say our experience was not worth the $115 we paid. Never going back again! Save your money!!"}
{"text":"Good food. 3.5 out of 5 but i'm nicer than most people think so i give it a four.  guacamole was nice, the pomegranate in it was a great gesture but felt it a bit having sat too long before being served.  The \"pollo\" was reasonable but the \"mole\" was amazing.  their house made drinks way too sweet.  service: friendly and a bit brusque ...the server almost snapped at me saying \"i don't understand you!\" i should have told him because he was a damn idiot but decided to take the high road.  anyways at the end all worked out and i would enjoy going back there on my next visit.  Thanks to my good friend Erin for her recommendation."}
{"text":"Came for dinner last night....Aaron was our waiter...I felt the quality of the Food and the temperature has seriously deteriorated. The morale of the bartender seemed very \"flat\", however the courtesy \"smiles\" of the waiter  Did not make up for the fact that we felt \"rushed\" throughout the meal, even Ordered takeout because we loved the food so much In the past! the ... Most disappointing part, was that the waiter forgot to bring the \"chile nogada\" to the table which I Ordered as a part of the meal...and his response Was \"oops sorry my mistake I'll put in now....wow, it was brought to us at The end of our meal.....this would not be acceptable in the \"Windy City.\"   the food in general was served \"lukewarm, they seemed short staffed and  Definitely a moral issue.....Cesar was not even smiling?.... What is going on guys....You have a great thing here....you are going to lose it....  the reviews are not impressive and the quality of,service and food is clearly Deteriorating...\".The ambience is noisy, true but it is small quarters to,be expected....for the price of the food ....you should be on your game!!!! by the thick cut Zucchini has to go....it is economical, but the customers Are saying very boring and I clearly understand that....There is EQ out there From customers...read the meaning......."}
{"text":"Delicious mole chicken amd one of the best margaritas in town. Dont miss this charming authentic place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant but if the crowds are too much then I'd drive up the street to Asi es la Vida.  The gauc, cochinita pibil, and churros con cajeta is the ideal trio for dinner.  The place is well done albeit very crowded and noisy.  The staff quality varies depending on who is waiting your table."}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican in a cool no frllls enviroment.  Tried and loved the Enchiladas chicken and seafood. Great sauce. Salads and veg with entrees. Good shit."}
{"text":"Love this place. I got the shrimp salad? (Can't remember what I got exactly...) The mango are really fresh. :)  A bit pricey though."}
{"text":"This place is good, I've been there a couple times...love the ambiance, the art in the walls. They have live music on Fridays! The guacamole was the best, almost better than mine, I love the pomegranate. Horchata in a coke bottle, and cochinito pibil tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"I like Mexican food and this place did not disappoint! My family and I were in Phoenix for only a few hours and my husband's cousin suggested coming here for dinner. The outside wall art was an added bonus. Best dinner suggestion ever! Although there was not a 'kid's menu' and hardly any food to choose from, we were able to get my daughter a few corn tortillas and chicken to make her own version. Problem solved. Our meals were fantastic and the sangria was the best I'd ever had!"}
{"text":"See the guys in triple D and have been wanting to eat here done. I live in So Cal but come for business a fair amount so it's been tough to get here but I finally made it. Sooooooo glad I did.!! Cochinita Pibil was bar far the best I've had. I had them make me up a low rider marg to go alongside and it too was money!     All i can say is come here and enjoy a non greasy, non traditional ( no chips and salsa, no rice and frijoles) mexican good joint.  It rocks! !!!"}
{"text":"Located on the west side of 16th St. between Osborn and Thomas Road in a tiny old strip mall in the heart of the 'hood, it's not called Barrio for nothing.  This has gone from great neighborhood find to being written up in the New York Times as a \"must do\" when in Phoenix, so be early or be prepared to wait.  The food and atmosphere def have a funky yet festive, artsy feel.  The food is along the similar vein of Padres; but featuring a guacamole appetizer that shouldn't be missed as it's mixed for you fresh at your table and served with big round chips ...yum!  Again with the desert ...some chocolate creation to die for!  Moderately priced."}
{"text":"Love the artwork and the fish tacos were good, too.  I'd like to try more of the menu because I'm not sure if I like the place as much as I think I do.  Well, that's confusing but it's not my fault because this restaurant obviously seduced me.    Okay, I can at least say that I'll be back because, if nothing else, the made-from-scratch horchata in a Coke bottle is very good.  (No credit to Coca-Cola here although, considering the ongoing slide in soda sales, the company might think of copying the Barrio Cafe's cheeky idea.)"}
{"text":"Last month, I went to Barrio Café while visiting Phoenix.  I was excited to see Chef Silva's take on Mexican cuisine.  Surprisingly, it ended up being one of the most frustrating and negative restaurant experiences I've had in a couple of years.  While I was genuinely amazed by how wonderful some of dishes were that night, my partner and I received extremely poor table service, experienced long delays waiting for our entrees, and received cold food that had to be replaced.    My partner and I arrived on a pretty busy evening.  After getting on the wait list, I ordered a cocktail at the bar.  The bartender forgot my order, and then forgot what type of drink I ordered.  Once that was sorted out, we waited in the outside patio area enjoying more drinks until our table was ready.  At that point in time, the rush was over and tables were slowly starting to clear.  After being seated, we ordered the shrimp quesadillas and queso fundido as appetizers.  For dinner entrees, we ordered the duck breast and mole chicken breast. Our two appetizers arrived promptly.  The shrimp quesadilla was amazing. I am not sure what I was expecting, but I loved it - the reduction sauce had a lot of strong, fresh flavors and the shrimp was of excellent quality.  The queso fundido was also delicious. It was spicy but not overpowering, and the taste and texture of the cheese and crème mix was amazing.  All the flavors blended really well.    Over half an hour later, we realized we had still not gotten our entrees.  By then, our section of the restaurant had almost cleared out and there was no sign of our server.  We overheard the people at the remaining table in our section complaining they had received the final bill, but had not been served some of the food they had ordered. More time passed, and we were about to get up and find someone (anyone) when a new server came into the room with our entrees.   On my first bite of the duck, I noticed the skin was dried out and rubbery, and it was not warm. My partner took a bite of his mole chicken breast and then said to me \"Is your food cold?\"  We confirmed that the sides were cold too.  The grilled zucchini was barely room temperature, and the polenta-based side was actually cold in the center, as if it had been refrigerated but not properly reheated.  At that point, my partner immediately got up and found the server in the other room.  All he said was \"our food is cold.\" The server didn't blink an eye, or act surprised. Rather, she rushed in and scooped up our plates while saying she'd get us replacements.  Although speculation, we wondered how long our food had been sitting out before the second server brought it to us, and if she had hoped we wouldn't notice anything wrong.    Eventually, our original server came back to our table and I think it was the first time we had our drinks refreshed since we had been seated.  We decided we were fine waiting for the new entrees and made polite chit-chat.  At that point, the restaurant was quiet, almost empty.  Silverware was being prepped, and linens were being placed on tables for the next day.    By the time our entrees arrived, over an hour had passed since we had ordered. Even though the original dishes came with polenta, it was now conspicuously missing from both plates.  We also noted there was a lot more zucchini.  The duck was fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The properly prepared mole sauce with my partner's dish, however, was really delicious. Spicy, and a lot of complex flavors that meshed together beautifully.  It went really well with the chicken, which had a smoked taste that complimented the sauce very well.  At that point, though, we just quietly finished our meals.    When finished, the original server said they'd like to comp our desserts if we were interested.   Nothing piqued our interest, but we ordered flan to share since one should never turn down a free dessert.  It tasted fine.  Overall, I see why people rave about the food, which made our experience there all the more frustrating.  While the entire staff was courteous, the service was completely substandard from the moment we were seated.  I strongly suspect they simply forgot about us and that our entrees sat out getting cold for quite some time before they realized their error.  They didn't try to correct it until we called them out.  They did not seem surprised when we did.  After all the delays and food problems, we got a comp'd a $10-ish dessert.  That's not experience you should get with a James Beard recognized restaurant and chef.  So that's why I gave it a one-star review."}
{"text":"I'm not a big yelper and usually only write reviews when something blows me away and this place did!  My wife and I were in Phoenix for a few days and lucky for us Barrio was not far from the hotel we were staying at (Embassy Suites).  This was such a great experience.  The food was amazing, service was great and the Micheladas were out of this world good!  Also, they had a couple guys playing some live music(if anyone else was there 04.04.15 please message me who they were, would like to buy/download some of their music if available).  Overall great restaurant and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner last evening at Barrio Cafe with hubby and a friend from Seattle. We can all recommend the Guacamole, made fresh, table-side, and the \"real\" margarita's -- Tequila, agave nectar, lime juice -- none of that rancid \"sweet and sour\" stuff, thank heavens! I enjoyed the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos), Bob had the Pescado del Mar (halibut w/a shrimp, scallop, lobster sauce), and Ron had the Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork). This ain't no Taco Bell, folks! Fantastic, fresh authentic Mexican food! We finished with a digestif (sipping tequila) Don Julio Añejo - YUM! I would give this place 5 stars, except there needs to be more appetizer and entree choices for those of us with soft shell seafood allergies -- Yes, I know everything can be made without certain ingredients -- but if you take off the shrimp or lobster or crab and are not prepared to make it differently, I feel a little \"cheated\" on the experience (not to mention, price).  And please, do NOT remove the choices you have now as my husband and friends LOVE them! ;)"}
{"text":"I have been fortunate lately because most places that I've taken the time to eat at have been very good.  This place is no exception.  Great authentic Mexican food.  I had slow roasted pork tacos with incredible fries and chipotle ketchup.  Simple but great food.  The pork tacos were very tender and had just the right amount of spice.  My wife had an avocado, mango, shrimp, tomato salad with a vinegarette.  It was very tasty.  Again, simple and fresh.  This is the only place in the valley we've been where they can actually make a margarita correctly.  If you've ever been to Mexico they typically use quality tequila, fresh sqeezed lime juice, and and orange liquor (triple sec, cointreau).  The bartender here makes them just like that, no disgusting sweet and sour or other sweet juices.  You should be able to taste the tequila and just because there is tequila in the drink doesn't mean you're going to turn into a raging drunk and black out.  If you drink enough of anything that will happen.  A good 100% agave tequila adds flavor.  Try it you might like it.  He also gave us a great idea for making margarita's with tequila, lime, and a little agave syrup.  Cool guy and great idea.  You can buy agave syrup at trader joe's or fresh n easy.  We use 2 shots of tequila, 1 shot fresh lime juice, and 3/4 shot triple sec or cointreau.  However, instead of the triple sec or cointreau I am going to try 1 big teaspoon of the agave syrup.  Should be good."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch! I had the Carne Asada tacos and they were delicious - small, double-shelled street tacos with Cotija cheese and pico de gallo. My husband had the Enchiladas Suiza and those were delicious as well. My mom had the Chile en Nogada but I am not sure how that was since she hate it so fast I didn't get a chance to try it! :) Wait staff was friendly and everything was delicious. The fryer was down today so I didn't get to try the churro rellenos but next time I am getting it for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food. Who cares what it looks like outside. Fish tacos were amazing. Check this place out if you want authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"I dare you to find better Mexican food on the planet! Chef Silvana is a culinary genius and Barrio Cafe is, in my opinion, one of the top 5 restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a must try if you are in the neighborhood. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, this has more of a Oaxacan cuisine than the usual Mexican fare.   To start off, they don't serve chips and salsa while you wait for your food, instead you get bread and Tapenade, totally awesome. I ordered Chilaquiles de Mole and it was the best I've ever had. The portion was quite large as well.  The place is very small and they tried to squeeze in as many tables in there as possible which made the place too stuffy and too close to other people dining in; and I presume it could get too noisy as well. I got in here early so it wasn't too crowded, although it might not be a comfortable place for a cozy dinner on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Provender: cochinita pibil tacos with salad. They also serve complimentary bread with a unique salsa. There are two dining areas. Staff was excellent, very attentive.  Prices: reasonable, taco combo and some Micheladas will run you about $20.  Parking: is parking behind the building near the rear entrance.  People: fun for all ages.  Perks: I like this place because of the artwork, both inside and out. This is a great place for a girls night out, not bros that are starvin' Marvin. I didn't find the tacos to be as flavorful as other spots I've been to in Phoenix, but maybe I came at a bad time."}
{"text":"We were told about this place before visiting Scottsdale and decided to go.  We were not disappointed.  The margaritas were terrific (a great selection), and the food was equally good.  It is one of the best restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.  I  saw this place on a top 10 best in the country list. It's more French than mexican. When you sir down yoy get bread and something that looks like olive paste.  I loved the spread but the bread was slightly stale. But eatable.  I was in the more for chips so u got guac it said award winning. It was more of a avocado salad.  Are you staying to see a grand.  But I did like the guacamole it was different with cran raisins.  I ordered carne tacos because the chillrenno sauces scared me.  The meat was high end trays like a roast. Not like asada. The problem wad it was very beefy. I have to say it was gross I should have sent it back.  I know what your thinking beef is beefy. But this was bad. If you want new types of recipes and don't mind paying twenty dollars plate fire a dumpy place with white table clothes go try. There is a lot to like about this place"}
{"text":"First time here, on the recommendation of other yelpers! I must say it was delicious!!! Big BOLD, spicy flavors :)   I ordered the Guacamole del Barrio to start, it didn't came with pomegranate seeds as seen in other yelp reviews. It came with dried cranberries. It was still fresh and had balanced flavor! I also ordered the Organica Margarita. It was very crisp and refreshing and a decent pour of tequila!   For lunch I decided on the Kuali de Camaron. I saw a gentleman at the table next to me with this order and I was sold on appearance alone. It had bold, spicy and VERY fresh flavors! Large enough to serve as a main dish for me. My guest ordered the Pollo Panlano. It was opposite, creamy and fresh taste, it was a large dish. It came with a side of the chipotle mash potatoes and grilled zuchinni. They did have a Sunday brunch menu until 3 and had a live musician until 2pm.   The restaurant is rather small and very busy, so they were a little slow with the service in the beginning until the servers caught up, but our server Jamie was very pleasant and apologized for the delay.   The artwork (murals) on the exterior walls were beautiful. And the artwork hanging inside was great too! Overall great atmosphere and amazing food! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that my expectations for this place were probably higher than they should have been.  A James Beard Award winning chef serving food at reasonable prices?!? Who would've guessed it?  And I love mexican food, so this seemed like a win-win for me.  I'd been talking with my girlfriend about going to this restaurant since we moved to Phoenix.  To start off with, I love the character of the place.  So many restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale try way too hard with the modern trendy look, so its nice to have some character.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  The horchata texture was a little different (being grainier than I'm used to), but still good.  My girlfriend's margarita was pretty tasty, but nothing special.  I didn't try their guacamole which I regret, because when I saw them making it table-side it looked delicious.    Considering everything I heard about this place, I was a little disappointed when the food ended up just being pretty good.  I love a good mole sauce, and our server really talked it up.  Unfortunately, when the food arrived the mole sauce was okay and the chicken was dry.  My girlfriend's cochinita pibil was quite a bit tastier than my pollo en mole.  The portion sizes are large, and it'll definitely fill you up.  I'm willing to give this place another shot since you don't win a James Beard award for just decent food.  Next time I'll probably try the chilies en nogada since it's the \"iconic dish\", and just see if I didn't visit on an off night."}
{"text":"Just got back from Barrio Cafe a few minutes ago and I just have to say how much I loved it there before I fall into a deep food coma.  Guacamole. Absolutely adored this guacamole, because I love when there's, well was it pomegranite seeds or cranberries (?), whatever it was..it just makes the guac a little sweeter and gives it a different taste. It was served with really thick baked tortilla chips. We accompanied this guac with a yummy sangria and my hubby had a margarita.   Next, the Quesadilla Langosta Boraccha. This had garlic and tequila lobster on corn tortillas covered with Oaxacan cheese and another white cheese. The waitress couldn't be excited enough to have us try it, and I'm glad we ordered it because it was that good!  Cochinita pibil - the achiote seasoning really set this 12 hour  slow roasted pork off!  Enchilada del Mar - Oh-so-rich enchiladas with lobster, scallops and crab topped with queso de cabra!  Since we live so far, I decided to order the Flan de mi Mami and Churros Rellenos.  Yes, we could not help but order dessert too because we don't know our limits. Churros are perfect! The flan was thick, the right texture, consistency, and flavor (just like my best friend's mom from Guadalajara makes it)!   Since we came on a Sunday, they had a guitarist playing from noon until 2pm. He played all traditional classic songs on his Spanish guitar. It felt \"just right\" being there. I can see what all the hype is about! It is on the pricer side so go here if you want something extra flavorful and with a different edge."}
{"text":"The food is exotic and tasted ok , however it didn't come out well on the other end.  I spent over 140 dollars to get food poisoning from this overpriced restaurant that has such poor hygiene.  The bathroom was filthy which makes me wonder what could be lurking in the kitchen.  Bring your own sanitation napkins if you go here.  Where is the food inspector?"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place that words cannot do it justice. I've taken every out-of-town guest here, and they've all loved it. Tableside guacamole with pomegranate seeds: inspired. Seafood enchiladas: divine. You will probably have to wait, but it will be so worth it."}
{"text":"Tried Barrio cafe again. Still had the same experience. I actually ordered the same thing as last time- the thing I really wanted to try they no longer make- \"FOREVER\", I was told. So, anyhow- again, the mariscos enchiladas were killer. I did find a shell in my food again, but only 1 this time. My margarita was not very good- I tried a house one this time. It was just very sweet. My friend had one that was sort of a red color. It wasn't very good either. I don't think he finished it. He originally tried to order a different one, but the server told him not to- said it tasted like \"cough syrup\".  The food tastes good, the drinks just aren't great. It's very expensive. It was $13 for guacamole. They make it table side, but our server put in way too much lime juice, so it was... well, it was okay, but probably not $13 ok.   I don't know... $95 for 2 drinks, 1 guacamole and 2 entrees seems steep to me. I do like the place, but I think it will just be a once in awhile spot. I have had much less expensive meals at swankier places in the valley. It's not that swank is important- I just am weighing the value differences.  Our server discouraged my friend from many of his entree choices telling him certain things were not good... eek. I appreciate her honesty, but kinda a bad sign about the food."}
{"text":"This place is the best! The food is authentic with a nice flare. The service was fast and great. The portions are perfect and the drinks exceptional!"}
{"text":"Central Phoenix. CenPho. Cennypoo. What am I going to do with you? Every time I think I can't possibly fall any harder for you, you surprise me with something new and unexpected that blows my mind. No, you don't have the stereotypically sexy look at first glance that Manhattan or San Francisco or Chicago do. To be honest I can barely remember our first date, which I think was when I stopped at Majerles in '98 before walking on to Bank One Ballpark to watch the fledgling Dbacks. Admit it, you weren't even trying to impress me back then, were you? I walked you back to my car hoping for a lil' somethin' after the game, but you barely even looked at me and I had nowhere to go. So back home I went, to that hot sexy young thing I was with at the time. What was her name? Oh yeah. Tempe. Wow. She was something. Back in the day, all the other cities would see me with her and glare with envy at how good she looked strutting her stuff on Mill Ave on a Friday night.   Slowly but surely, you began to wage your subtle campaign of charm on me. Even a jaded guy like me began to notice all the little things that really matter in life. I woke up one morning and there you were with a tray in hand and, on it, Matt's Big Breakfast. I'll never forget that other time when you tricked me into wandering up Central Ave and \"accidentally\" stumbling across Lux. Need I go on? It seems like every other time I'm with you, I make a new discovery. The more I get to know you, the more tiny bursts of elegance and grace and uniqueness shower my senses. No, not all of them are on one street tightly bunched together like those snooty runway models New York or San Francisco, which are so uppity that I'd have to be a multimillionaire to even have a chance to really enjoy them anyway, much less afford property. No, you make me dig a little deeper, look a little closer, and do a little exploring before I'm rewarded with your precious gems. A good seductress knows how to maintain an aura of mystery about her. And you, darling, are good.   So here I am, already having developed a pretty huge crush on you. And then you up the ante by another notch. Cafe Barrio. Barely visible, in a nondescript strip mall by 16th Street and Thomas. On a Wednesday night I walked past a crackhead through the run-down parking lot to enter through a backdoor, my suspicious mom in tow. And once again, you blow me away. The place is packed. I hear laughter, engaged conversation, people with grins on their faces, people on dates, another dude also with his mom (who actually smiled knowingly at my mom as we walked by). An entire world of urban happiness that's invisible to the commuters whizzing by outside on 16th street. What is this food? It's not traditional Sonoran, that's for sure. Ohhhh, I see: it's \"modern Mexican with a heavy French influence,\" as your waitress put it. Sure. Find two of the kinds of cuisine I love most, and somehow find a way to combine them in one, all in an unpretentious setting 6 minutes away from my house. Damn, woman, you are good.   I don't say this lightly. When you came out with a tray, cut open that avocado, and mixed up various fresh ingredients in front of our very eyes to make the tastiest guacamole me or my mom have ever tasted in our life, I knew the moment had arrived. I'm ready to take the plunge. I'm ready to say that I don't want to ever live anywhere else, because there is no way I could get to know someone as intimately, as closely, as sweetly as I do you. Yeah yeah, there are other fish in the sea. I know that. But you're my fish, Cennypoo."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and had to check it out. Very authentic and creative Mexican food. The place has tons of character and is definitely a stand out. The service was outstanding, drinks were refreshing and everything we ordered was great. I would highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"We both agreed the queso fundido was the best queso dip ever!! It was an explosion of taste.  We ordered the fish of the day, alaskan halibut, veracruz style, and carne asada enchiladas suizas style.  I think the queso fundido killed the taste buds for everything else.  Everything else tasted a little bland but still have good flavor.  We probably should have eaten the queso dip last. :)  The horchata is so so.  it's a little too sweet.  service was so so.  bill for 2 before tip is $70."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from out of town; we had an early flight out of Phoenix, were in town for one night only and were looking for a place for dinner. The AAA guide sent us here; it did not disappoint. We had kind of a long wait, but we ordered drinks from the friendly bartender to pass the time. When we were finally seated, we promptly ordered the guac. It was fresh and delicious-the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. I got the chicken enchiladas suizas, which were also great. Hubby got the grilled tacos; they were also fresh and tasty. I have no idea when I'll be in Phoenix again but if I ever am I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Talk about cognitive dissonance!  I love the idea behind this place: authentic cuisine, art adorning the walls, innovative cuisine, no-frills attitude, and a James Beard nominated chef!  Here's what kills this place: Gabe. He is one of the worst servers I have had in a while. He killed the experience, made us want to leave in a hurry, and, in essence, ruined a nice dinner.    Details of the food/drinks: -Beers were $4.75. Hubby got the House Margarita and, while he did say they were poured weakly, it was quite refreshing and used a great mix. -Quesadilla with Langostine Borracho: My favorite dish of the evening.  It didn't arrive \"quesdilla\" style at all.  We had 4 small tortillas topped with the grilled langostine and wonderfully flavorful chunks of goat cheese; there was a flavorful pico de gallo in the center.  It was totally unexpected and totally good. -Cochinita Pibil: everyone raves about this dish.  It was very well prepared, with slow-roasted pork, freshly made tortillas, sour-orange onions, a wonderful mashed potatoes made with Chipotle peppers (which I found out from a food runner since Gabe was MIA), and an interesting vegetable to go with the asparagus. I think this vegetable is the Chayote, from listening to another waiter explain things to his guests with great enthusiasm (cue jealous looks now).  With all this, something didn't quite add up in the dish.  The flavors didn't come together and wow me. -Chicken Mole: The mole sauce was nice, with a good complexity, but there was hardly any sauce on the plate.  Nicely cooked pieces of chicken wrapped up in tortillas, with mole and a cream sauce drizzled over the top. More Chayote and Asparagus.  Good but not great.  Now onto Gabe.  Ooh! I'm still so mad!  He was gruff, inattentive, and just rude.  When I asked if they had pitchers of beer, I got a brusque \"No,\" as he looked down his nose at me.  The hubby ordered his drink, and I said I'd like another minute.  That was a mistake. 5 minutes later he brings the hubby's margarita and doesn't ask if I'd like anything; he just walked away.  As we flagged his down to order our appetizer, I was finally allowed to order a glass of water and a beer.  We had to flag him down for everything. And when the option of dessert came up, he rattled them off to us, without explaining them and, when we weren't ready to decide yet, left again.  A wonderful young lady who boxed up our food brought us a menu so we could read about the desserts.  I was so mad that I didn't want to pay 12 bucks for a dessert and have to deal with Gabe any longer.  Overall final thoughts: -Innovative chef, with interesting ideas. Some cohesiveness is missing from some dishes though. -Fix Gabe. Seriously. He ruined our night! Other servers were warm, friendly, answered questions, checked on their guests, etc. -Prices are a bit steep. I'm not cheap by any means, but I felt like we paid a lot and didn't receive quite the same in return.   -Seriously about Gabe."}
{"text":"Ate at the Sky Harbor Airport location in Phoenix.  The cochinita pibil was good in the tacos, but it was overpriced.  Good food, but not outstanding and a little too expensive for me for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"As did others we drove by the first time but the two room cafe lived up to its best Mexican restaurant rating for the past five years by the AZ Republic.  During the day the guacamole with olive oil, vinegar, onions, cilantro & pomegranate seeds is not made at the table and includes delicious (not calorie free) topopos (round, fried chip like tortillas). For a side salad we had an unusually tasty spinach salad with a hint of sweet & spicy vinaigrette and toasted pecans, roquefort, apples and slow roasted tomatoes. For the entre we had  Enchiladas Suizas (Mexico City style) with chicken and tomatillo cream sauce which fit our mild taste buds.  Cafe Barrio is a step up in a culinary experience from our usual default Mexican restaurant of choice, (i.e., Macayos)  and would definitely be worth a repeat in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Very quaint. The walls have local art on them. Chances are when you come you will have to wait and man is it worth it! Get the guacamole with everything in it, trust me!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that we weren't notified that their chiles en nogada is a seasonal dish. Not only is it highlighted on their menu, there is no mention of it being seasonal and our waiter had 3 interactions with us before we tried to order it and he then notified us that they didn't have it. Really, your restaurant specialty and what you're known for and you just mention it now? Our group of four was very disappointed since we were coming for this dish. The other food was good but paled in comparison."}
{"text":"So I was toying with 3 or 4 stars.  And as you can see,  I settled with four stars because I know I will be back.  So we have eyed this place for YEARS.  It has been booked marked for me since I have started yelp.  And one Sunday evening we finally decided to give it a try.  It starts off with a 45 minute wait, which I expected, but luckily we only had to wait 10 minutes.  I am glad they prepared to expect the worse, so as I braced myself for a long wait it felt like a gift when in 10 minutes we were seated and perusing the menu.  We had to try the guacamole.  You get to chose what goes in it, and the server recommended everything, which means everything you expect in a guac with something you don't expect: pomegranate seeds.  It was expensive, but fresh and very good.  Now the reason why I toyed with 3 stars.  My entree.  I had the carne tacos and hubby had the Cochinita Pibil.  I honestly though they were just okay.  Hubby RAVED about his slow roasted pork.  I found it tender, but not tasty.  My carne tacos were good enough, but for the price and all the hype I guess I had expected to be wowed more.  Service was good.  So back to toying with the stars again. Expensive Mexican food, but it was kinda worth it....  See I am trying to figure that one out.  So I need to come back and try another dish. I do think this place is more than just the 3 star definition of A-OK.  For me, it is more like 3 1/2 stars. I decided to round up to four stars, because I will be back. Also my hubby enjoyed it so much, and that makes me happy.  But this was the most reluctant four stars I have yet to hand out."}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here this morning casting my Zagat votes I cant help but feel underwhelmed by the selections on their \"Arizona's Top Restaurants\" I cant help but wonder why some of these places are on here. Is Barrio Cafe really the best of? For me, I think not.  We went with about 6 friends so we were able to try many things on the menu. However nothing even remotely stood out. Oh yes something did, the loud dining room. It was so loud we were literally shouting at one another from across the table. I love to talk over dinner so my throat was pretty hoarse afterwards.. ah yes, the waiter was a very nice looking man and was super flirty with all of us.. he got a big tip.  Otherwise I scratch my head and wonder why so many people gush over this place? Its not bad, its just blah."}
{"text":"Yum!! Awesome food. I had steak tacos, fries and salad, I recommend all of the above."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is VERY NOISY!! Is is also busy in there. Pretty packed. It is a somewhat small place & kind of cramped, but has very cool, artsy paintings on the walls, & the bathrooms are very decorative! The food is pretty good, not amazing, but not horrible, either.  The food did take a while to come out."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal at the Barrio. Be cautious of the restaurant bearing its name at the airport. Go for the original and skip the imitation."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation during a work trip. It was truly a great experience. Their staff is so friendly and will help you pick an entree or drink that is what you are looking for. They know the flavors well and won't steer you in the wrong direction.  We split three entrees and they were all the perfect spice level. Margaritas were too good, could have sat there all night. Guacamole is freshly made at your table with a twist - they add in pomegranate! Surprisingly amazing - will be adding to my homemade guac!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place is a diamond in the rough!  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and give great accurate descriptions of the dishes.  Margaritas are fresh squeezed juices and perfectly mixed.  Gauc is made table-side and not in bla bla same old fashion. A nice pomegranate finish. Very nice!!  The pulled pork is unbelievably delicious and a house special.  Enchiladas with a creamy tomatillos sauce blew me away.  Go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ok, I needed to write an update.  Went back a second time for a business dinner, had the same fantastic margarita and enchiladas, but also found the parking lot in the rear.   Sorry Barrio, it's definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place comes with great expectations due to the favorable press it receives. The neighborhood is a little dicey and finding a park was a challenge (it's in back) but once inside a saw a small bar area and a cozy dining room with most tables filled during the lunch hour. We scored a table and ordered the table side guacamole dish that most of the diners went with. The menu is not your standard Mexican fare, so fewer options than you may be used to. I went with chile Colorado with was very good. I would like to come back and try it for dinner."}
{"text":"The parking is in the back.  This is the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  I would be here every week if we lived in Phoenix.  Table side guacamole was a fantastic appetizer.  My wife's carne esada tacos were great.  I had the seafood enchiladas, I would pass on these."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The mole was perfect. I may venture all the way to arizona for lunch here again...."}
{"text":"This is very good upscale Mexican food.  My only problem is I find it hard to swallow $20 - $30 for a plate of Mexican food.  I know it is very good quality, but I feel for that kind of money I could have a better experience elsewhere.  If the price doesn't bother you, then by all means, it is very good."}
{"text":"I have to admit to being pretty seriously underwhelmed by Barrio Café. It wasn't awful by any means, but it wasn't worth the 45-minute wait my friend and I endured last night for a table. The guacamole was perfectly serviceable, with the addition of pomegranate seeds a very nice touch.  It was probably the best thing we ate. The other appetizer, a queso fundido, was under salted and straightforward. Likewise the Yucatan pork tacos, which I thought were utterly unremarkable. We also ordered chicken enchiladas with a black mole. I enjoyed the sauce, but my friend thought it was too molasses-y. And even so, I thought the sauce a little one-note. All chocolate, not much else.   Oh, and the tortillas? Not even in the same ballpark as Tortillaria Sinaloa. I'm telling you Baltimore, you don't know how good you've got it."}
{"text":"I keep going back here and forget to update.  This is hands-down one of my favorite places to eat. I even started eating guacamole - and I never liked it before.  I did read some of the other reviews that we less than 4 stars. All I can say is that many people are used to low-end Mexican food... rice and bean style. This is not that.  The mole is authentic, not the out of a can crap, and it tastes VERY different. It is somewhat of an love or hate thing... but trust me, for real mole, it is VERY good.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing space!!! Staff were friendly and helpful and the food was very delicious and innovative! The margaritas were also great, specifically the low rider and organica! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food so good, I can hear Angels sing! I had Chile Nogada, which was a delicious experience. Whose very in the kitchen is amazing. I was in heaven during every bite. It was full house and Ruben checked on me often."}
{"text":"Ate hear after a friend recommended it. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a restaurant this much. Sadly I dont remember the name of the items we got, but it was their two signature dishes. We also had the flan and churro deserts. Flan was made perfectly and this was the first time I have enjoyed a churro.  The only negative part of my visit was when I remembered that Denver doesn't have any place that is close to this good."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and it is absolutely excellent.  From the enchiladas suisas to the churros to even the coffee, this place is as good as Mexican food gets.  Service is top notch, and they certainly don't cut any corners on any of the ingredients used."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes after recommendations from people and good reviews. My uber driver on the way said he used to work there too. Small world. I was solo and was offered a seat at the bar or table. I asked for a table and didn't have to wait long for one. I ordered the guacamole and the cochinita pibil tacos. Their two most popular dishes. The guacamole was prepared table side and I enjoyed. But it could have used more kick and more citrus. I ate it willingly but it wasn't as special as reports had led me to believe. As for the tacos, they were just ok. The pibil was surprisingly a little dry. Again for their signature dish I expected more. It's a cool spot otherwise. Lot of great artwork on the walls. But didn't live up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"I really like this place, The atmosphere and the food is awesome!!! Misconception that is Mexican food, the food on the menu represent the 22 Latin American countries, which is why it is called Barrio Cafe. Highly recommend a Sangria with the meal. Oh and the capirotada is always a must for desert!!!"}
{"text":"Superb food , but terrible inattentive service!   This restaurant has so much potential , but even a good restaurant has great service.  Step it up!"}
{"text":"The bartender was awesome. Made a great custom mezcal drink on the fly. The $28 halibut I ordered was hella overcooked, which saddened me because it's such a beautiful piece of fish and a pretty sizable portion. Also, the \"pipián\" was more of a cilantro cream sauce (good sauce, but don't call it pipián). The pozole was good, but not much different than my own - so props for a solid pozole! But also if I pay for it I want it to be better than what I can do on my own, and it didn't come with tortilla or tostada. Finally, the ambiance was great and felt really inviting, super warm and artsy and culturally relevant for this Texas chicana, but the service was meh - maybe our server was weeded? Overall, I was a little disappointed because I felt like there was so much there that was possible but the execution was a little off. Hope the management pays closer attention on other days! Lots of potential here."}
{"text":"A local hot spot in a non-hot spot. The location for this fine restaurant is a little off the beaten path, but many have found their way to this delicious establishment as there is always a crowd from the moment they open. Not your typical Mexican joint. If you are looking for basic burros or tamales or chimichangas don't look hear. If you want a selection of thoughtfully created tastes and food then you will not go wrong here."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe was very good as usual. The consistency is amazing.  My fav is the  Pato en Tamarindo Seared duck breast finished with a striking sweet and sour, tamarind chipotle reduction. She is a little over priced but very good."}
{"text":"Seriously, not the best tacos in the country!  Also,this place is supposed to serve the community and be part of a revival process...it's just another part of gentrification with those prices.  $13 for a three tacos in the hood, really?!  $12 for a drink?!  Not ok. And it took 40mins to get our meal to the table which was sloppy.  My friend's tacos didn't have sauce on them or slices of avocado like mine, and the waiter, who was nice, didn't show up to the table to check on us.  He forgot my other friend's drink and never brought it...it was a mess. I will say however, their guac is pretty delicious.  Would I go back?  Honestly, no."}
{"text":"OMG!!  had the chicken enchiladas!!  they were the bomb,  I would  order this dish again.  our server was very efficient and sweet.  Live music very nice I felt like I was on vacation.  Good atmosphere clean,  and excellent food.  Yeah!   See you soon.."}
{"text":"I was in airport for a few hours and my son chose Barrio the Arizona Burrito was amazing.  Th service was above par and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Enchilada chicken, halibut , chorizo , starter salsa, guacamole etc ---- great .  Scott the server---- great.  Tried Signature Margarita and was not too great.  The sauce in the enchilada was very different and thrilling."}
{"text":"An interesting twist on Oaxacan Mexican food. Flavors are outstanding, portions are a bit small and prices are excessive. So restaurant if you are reading this adjust your prices. The area where you are located is cheap, you know it and I know it. If you want to charge upscale prices, make the whole experience gourmet. .....end of rant."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this place should in Scottsdale ! It's fine class dining"}
{"text":"I know this is blasphemy in my hood but I didn't like Barrio Cafe.  My husband and I had been trying to make it in there for a while now but everytime we go there it's packed so we opt for something less crowded.  We finally popped in during lunch; it's pretty cozy inside.  The server was rude, anything we said he acted like he had no idea what we were talking about and never cracked a smile.  I had the pollo poblano- the sauce was lacking in flavor, chicken was dry.  For the price I was expecting something better.  I didn't even like the margarita and I've never met a drink I didn't like.  Maybe the Chingona was out?"}
{"text":"This is definitely one one my favorite restaurants in town. The food, drinks and atmosphere is amazing!  Try the guac and Sangria for sure"}
{"text":"i've had lunch and dinner at barrio and it was night and day.  the fish tacos at lunch are spectacular.  tons of food and everything was well prepared and fresh.  the soups here are also killer.  then dinner - what a disappointment.  my friend has THE spiciest dish i've tasted in a long time - outweighed the hottest curry i've even had lately.  the chef obviously didn't taste what they were putting out because i'd never serve something to this caliber without due warning or knowledge.  i had the seafood enchiladas, which should have been called the queso fresco enchiladas with scatterings of seafood.  TONS of cheese.  i couldn't even finish the dish because of all the cheese.  i'm not in phoenix anymore and if i go back, i'll probably stick to my guns and not go to barrio, at least not for dinner.  but i'll give them another shot..."}
{"text":"Love! Love! LOVE this place! So ya it's in the hood but it is so good! And the decor inside is simple but the mood with the candles and live music makes it amazing! The food is delicious! I wish they had rice! But there's plenty of other sides to pick from! I been here a couple of time and will keep coming!"}
{"text":"Chiles en Nogada: The chile was OK- for the hype this place has received i really expected more flavor/spice-but no-. it was ONE Small stuffed Chile for $24 - way too overpriced!.  the sides were mashed potatoes and almost raw zucchini slices.   I don't think i will give this place a visit anytime soon because quite frankly, i can make the Chiles en Nogada for 4 people with that price."}
{"text":"One of the most flavorful, friendly, and unique experiences I have ever had at an out of town restaurant. My fiance and daughter came here because we love DDD and HAD to try this place because the food looked so delicious. It was definitely not a disappointment amd to top it off, service was incredible too. If you are in town, please don't hesitate to stop in and enjoy the shrimp quesadillas- to die for!"}
{"text":"If you went to this place without knowing it was supposed to be Mexican food and without realizing how much money you were going to pay at the end, I suppose it could have been an okay experience. Everyone who helped us was very nice, but man... the food was subpar at best. The guacamole that we saw so much praise for on here stumped us from the get go. It isn't mashed in the slightest and is instead large chunks of avocado with equally large bits of onion, pomegranate seeds, and other mix-ins. Maybe we're spoiled because we're from California, but this dish shouldn't even really be considered guacamole as far as I'm concerned. I got the carne asada tacos and my friend got the suiza enchiladas. Both very average. Neither of us got drinks, and our bill was well over $50. It was such a miss. We definitely regret stopping by and urge you to look for your Mexican food fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Fugees - Ready Or Not)  Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide Gonna find.... you Barrio Cafe Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide Gonna find.... you Barrio Cafe  Now that I need a taste, Bo Bites awake Those who could relate know Barrios the place Tacos with grilled skirt steak Special drinks, they make When they meet their margarita mate  If I could rule Phoenix Everyone would have to come at Calle 16 of course With pomegranite on their Guac I kick a rhyme eating tortas  I pour a sip on my palates, for the review But no don't weep, Chef Esparza's in a state to keep Thinking about the Elote that I had last week Sopas on the plate, Yelpers looked for some swag I want to eat with Mexicans from here to Tucson   I have to share my love of Barrio Cafe!  I've been to the Barrio Queen and Urbana, but this is my first run at the Cafe.  It had a more mom/pop feel and very homey compared to the more invested restaurants around town.  I wish they would have kept that feeling, but then again it's what makes Barrio Cafe so appealing.    I brought my friend from out of town to Barrio Cafe on a Saturday afternoon.  They had live music and the place was pretty busy.  We started off with some guacamole which famously introduced to me with tableside preparation and also the inclusion of pomegranate.  Still the best in town for sure!  For my entree I shot for their famous Cochinita Pibil, but taco style.  My friends ordered the Pescado Taco and Mole Enchiladas.  Overall, my marinated pork tacos definitely had some special love to it.  Warm to the bite and the pork was like butter and definitely been soaking in the achiote sauce for quite a bit of time.  The fish tacos were crunchy from the breading and the cabbage while the subtle bite of the avocado helped mellow it out from the aioli.  The mole had a strong cocoa taste, but mixed well the bland corn tortilla wrapped chicken giving a much needed flavor pop!  In the end, Barrio Cafe was voted best Mexican restaurant in the country for a reason.  It's local fare and alluring arts is well worth it as it sits in the heart of Phoenix. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, but super overpriced likely due to Triple D.  I was expecting more of a local joint and it was weird to have white table clothes and pay $25 at lunch for their signature chicken dish."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I checked out Barrio Cafe on a whim.  We almost drove right by it the first time, as it is nestled in a row of shops on 16th Street just before Thomas. There is a very very small parking lot in the back, but parking is also available on the residential street.  The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall on the outside, but inside the door is simple but very nice.  And the alcohol display when you first walk in is quite impressive!  The menu is quite large and incredibly diverse. It is not typical Mexican...I would describe it as Mexican with a flair.  I had the chicken \"torta\" with crab and cheese, which you can get with either a side salad or seasoned fries...I got the fries.  The chicken, cheese and crab combination was very tasty and incredibly filling. I was only able to eat about half of it and some of my fries before getting full.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the cheese and crab complimented each other very well and neither overpowered the taste of the chicken.  Service, at lunch, was very fast, although our service was a little underwhelming.  UPDATE-January 2008  I met a group of girlfriends for dinner on a Thursday night at Barrio.  The bar area is too small to adequately hold the number of people waiting on a busy night...I felt smushed like a sardine and it was almost impossible to get to the bar to order a drink while we waited.  Plus, we had an hour wait.  Luckily, our waitress was very nice once we got seated and was more than accommodating when we paid to run seven credit cards.  I tried the garlic and tequila lobster quesadilla...I did not like it at all.  First, I don't like open faced quesadillas...second, not enough cheese for my liking.  Third, the lobster was very blah and didn't taste like it was cooked properly.  Finally, there was live music that night.  We happened to be sitting pretty close to where the musicians were set up, which made conversation almost impossible.  I'm not sure live music in such a small establishment is really a good idea.  I would definitely recommend Barrio as a lunch location, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe = Meh, I've had better!   We were looking forward to trying this place an now that we have, I at least can say I've them a try...  This place falls way short on the flavor-roma scale when it comes to tasty Mexican food.   We have a group of five, so we tried several things on their menu.  The first thing we noticed were the portions.  Muy pequena!  Ok, so this is different than what many of the pics on Yelp look like but maybe it's not the size that matters in this place but rather the quality of food.  Pues no, la calidad es el mejor promedio (nope the quality is average at best).  Many of the pollo and rice items were very dry.  We also had an issue with our server.  He was no where to be seen for several minutes so we had to sick the hound dogs after him to get some refills.   Anyways, this place seems to fill up with plenty of locals.  So good luck!"}
{"text":"YES. You want to come here. It is delicious, fresh, and joyful. Things to know: it's insanely popular (for good reason) so be prepared to wait for a table, it's loud, and it's where happiness is."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and this place was recommended to us. We went in for lunch and the customer service was great. This was described as a French/Mexican restaurant. After eating there, I agree. The Mexican flavors were present with a French sophistication. We had the Fillet dish and the Nogadas special. I really enjoyed the use of uncommon ingredients such as pomegranate and almonds.  $$$, good portion size and worth the money."}
{"text":"I try to surprise my wife about once a month with a trip to Barrio.  It's not the closest restaurant to us, but it is always worth the drive.    I've read on past reviews that people say their margaritas are expensive, true, but you get what you pay for!  At least it's not a crappy expensive marg.    Rarely do we venture far from the \"Two Fish Tacos and Two Margarita 'Combo'\".  We'll mix it up with chips and guac once in a while, but that is just icing on the cake.    The decor is awesome and the place is quaint.  The parking is bad and the wait is long.  Worth it?  Hell yes!    I love it when Italians work at Italian restaurants... and the same goes true for Mexican joints.  Thanks for keepin it real Barrio!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Guy Fieri's show, I looked this place up while visiting on a business trip. The location is in an area I'd probably not want to be at night. The graffiti artwork is amazing surrounding the building.  As soon as you enter, the interior is classy and simple. The walls are adorned with more artwork.  The afternoon we were there, they had live music. They were fantastic!  Service was excellent. It was so nice to see everyone with great personalities in there.  We had the pomegranate guacamole. Interesting combo that was refreshing and light. I had the Cochinita Pibil Torta. It had me screaming oh my god with every single delicious bite! The meat was juicy and tender. The pickled onion gave it a nice tart kick and the spicy fries with that addicting chipotle ketchup sauce. Ay yai yai!!  We were in and out in about an hour so we could head on our way to continue our tour of the city. This is a MUST EAT place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is a review by a vegetarian. The universe (i.e. pervasive marketing) was willing us towards this place. It was featured in an article in the Southwest airlines magazine; had a big ad in the hotel's guide to services; and is one of the few places on Yelp with more than a handful of reviews.  Seating was prompt and friendly. The art on the wall, though vibrant and aggressive, didn't distract. Our server resembled a very happy and enthusiastic Mr. Clean, bald, always smiling and nodding.  The lemonade tasted real. The tableside gauc was really good even though I'm usually not a fan of so much tomato. The pomagranite seeds really work. The REAL fried tortilla chips really make the dish. My only compliant is the quantity/price ratio. $8 for one avocado's worth of guac. If my buddy were into it at all we would've been fighting over it. I heard the table next to us order a second shot of the stuff.  My spinach salad was nothing special.  No place to walk afterward. The price to pay for easy parking."}
{"text":"YOOOO, the best place I went to when I was in AZ. they have the best horchata in a coke bottle- no lie. the food is bomb.com. I got the fish tacos with a side of seasoned fries. my bf got the pulled pork burger (which we're not usually pulled pork fans) but that was pretty good too. The burger was not dry at all and everything that it came with including the fries just went well together! I def recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow!   This would be a 5 star review, but our service knocked it down a star  We waited about 45 minutes, but enjoyed the ambiance and the art work on the wall.  When we were seated, I already knew we were going to order the tableside guacamole (one of the items I found to be a bit over priced)  $12 for a pretty small bowl of guacamole.  Yes, it was fantabulous, so in the end I didn't mind paying...but it was a pretty small bowl to be shared between 3 people.  It was made very quickly (with little/no interaction from our server...when I noticed the other server in the area was laughing and explaining the process to his tables....however, our server was not the most personable of fellows...) and with very fresh ingredients, cilantro, jalapeno, pomegranate seeds...opted for no onions, and topped with fresh lime juice and seasonings.  It was delicious.  I also have to add that the tostadas that they use are fantastic.  Crispy, thick, not greasy or salty at all!  We ordered a couple of drinks, I chose my go-to drink: Michelada with Tecate.  I went picosito and it was delicious.  The right amount of hot sauce, lime juice and beer!  A friend of mine ordered the spicy margarita (which our server forgot and had to be reminded) and she loved it!    As for our meals, 2 of us chose the Mariscos enchiladas.  A white cream sauce with oaxaca cheese, bay scallops, shrimp...HUGE shrimp cooked to perfections, and crab meat.  A few hunks of calabasitas and it was ...TO...DIE...FOR!!!  The sauce really complimented the various seafood and not one of the ingredients overpowered any other.    The birthday girl opted for the carne asada tacos with spicy fries....spicy? Not so much...but very tasty!    We were stuffed.  But...it was my friend's birthday so we had to have some dessert!  We looked over the menu and before we could finish deciding, they brought over the best flan I have ever had in my life!  The consistency was ideal and it was covered with this caramel sauce and candied pecans.  Needless to say, we made room for the flan!    We were beyond satisfied with our meal, however...the service we received left a lot to be desired.  I found myself envious of the other tables who were greeted with smiles and had a server that waited for his customers to finish their sentences.  Ours made us feel as if we were a burden and he had better things to do.  He never acknowledged our orders and just walked away when we finished...almost before we finished and was always looking around instead of making eye contact.    I will be back and hopefully the service I receive will warrant me doing the well-deserved 5-star marking for this place!  Thank you Chef Silvana!  You are a gem in the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but not as good as I had hoped.  Just up the street is La Santisima, which was way better.  Barrio is a bit overpriced as well.  So what did we get...Cochinita Pibil is a slow cooked pork that tastes, well...like slow cooked pork!  I was expecting a bit more, and I'd say this is the dish that let me down.  Also got Chiles en nogada which was actually quite unique.  Spicy pepper stuffed with chicken and sprinkled with pomegranate - it's the one dish I'd recommend.  Both dishes had bland and forgettable sides.  Churros for dessert were okay but not great, and the horchata and frescos were good but crazy stupid over priced given they are just sugar water shaken up in a coke bottle."}
{"text":"I don't get the 5 star reviews. Place was very mediocre and we both felt sick afterword. The margarita was beyond sweet and undrinkable, my queso was just a chuck of melted cheese in the middle.... not worth it. Rest of the food was not even worth mentioning. Maybe the Barrio on Grand Avenue is better, wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I love the spin on traditional Mexican food. I had the goat cheese caramel and at first it was weird, but then I loved it. The poblano was great!"}
{"text":"Hostess was sassy and rude. We waited an hour and a half for a table. Also, the guacamole isn't anything to write home about. The spicy marg is actually just a tequila sunrise. Just go to chipotle."}
{"text":"Not really sure why this place has such rave reviews, maybe it's just not for me. I got the Enchiladas Suizas, which was essentially sugary chicken, cheese, and milk that tasted like a frozen microwave dinner. I love cheese and this was too much cheese. My fiancee got one of the tacos, which were alright, but not $12 good for the portions and flavors. The best part of the meal was the Guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds in it.  As for the service, it was minimal.  It was not busy at all and we waited a long time to be seated, for anyone to come take our order, for waters, and then a long time for the check - though oddly the food came fast.  I did not finish my enchiladas (I admittedly barely ate) and the waiter asked if I wanted it packed up, I said no thank you.  Later the manager came by and asked if I wanted it packed up and I said no thank you to him as well.  He asked me if I liked it and I said it was alright (I didn't want to be rude). He then launched into a story about how you should not lie and gave me literally his whole life story and how hard he has worked to get here. If he was looking for sympathy for a better tip, admittedly it worked, because based on the food and service I would have tipped on the low end.   I left feeling a bit conned, I spent a ton of money on food I didn't enjoy, wasted my time doing a lot of waiting throughout the service, then more time (I was really trying to get to an evening appointment) when the manager lectured me on telling him if I liked his food or not and his tragic backstory. He seemed nice enough, and I sympathize, but the combination of everything left a figurative and literal bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I don't like being tricked.  That's why Barrio's only getting 3 stars.  You sit down, and the waiter takes your drink order and caually asks you if you want some gaucamole.  Your natural response is yes, and then you discover when you get the bill that it's almost $11 for that gaucamole -- that can almost double your lunch bill.  When the waiter asks, he makes it seem like the free chips and salsa you get at any Mexican restaurant.  Sure, I should have known better, but still, I don't like getting duped.    The food is good and the service is good.  The lobster quesadilla appetizer was quite good.  I do go back because the food and the service is good, just be warned about the guac.  Oh, but the guac is really good -- it has pomegranate seeds on top.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was lovely!  As an out-of-towner, it was the perfect place to go for a local experience.  You must get there very early to get a seat, but they do have a new place outside to wait, if you have to. The guacamole was a treat - what with them making it for you at the table and including pomegranate seeds!  I ordered their \"specialty\" - some sort of pork dish which was ok...a little dry for my tastes.  I actually was kind of disappointed by it.  But, other than that, I give this place a solid 4 stars.  Cozy and sweet."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to dining here -we were very disappointed  ! First of all you need to go into it from a back parking lot into a door that was not signed very well to know to use it. The dining room area is very small and noisy. If you want an intimate place to chat over your meal,this is NOT THE PLACE  !  With all the awards and positive things we had heard about the taste of the food and etc,we were disappointed. Either we didn't order the items on the menu that qualified for such awards or it isn't the way they say it is.  The server was nice,but didn't come back too often to check out our need for drink refills and etc. We were there for the lunch time. We noticed the cost of the dinner items,they along with others were very pricy. This place isn't located in an area of Phoenix where this pricing is justified. If in Scottsdale or other equivalent areas, then possibly but not at this restaurant. We will NEVER RETURN to this place. SAVE YOUR MONEY ! This place serves food that tastes like those of the \"run of the mill\" type Hispanic restaurants that dot the landscape of Phoenix and surrounding areas  !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a \"Sunday afternoon\" with the family, first off I ordered the tacos de cochinita pibil, this is the pride of the Yucatán peninsula which is supposed to have a sweet earthy taste, not impressed not even close, also the meat was very dry. The prices were a bit high for the area where the restaurant is located. The decor; poorly neglected with cholo paintings on the walls. The tables were set much too close together. The poor kid behind me kept backing into my chair. I felt like I was eating inside an old school tattoo shop or trapped in a bad episode of The Art Laboe low rider show. If you're going to have fine dining prices maybe the decor should work in synergy with the menu prices. 11.00 for a mimosa is pretty high in my opinion. Our server was nice, pleasant and attentive. I'm a native, first time here, and we will not be back. Overrated, overpriced and a disappointment."}
{"text":"I loved this place since it opened. The food is always fantastic. She makes the best ketchup, you'll ever have...no joke."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. A bit of a wait, but that's because the food inside was worth waiting for. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo cream sauce, and I thought I was going to die from yumminess overload. I mean, it was one of the best things I've ever had in my life, and it was DEFINITELY the best enchilada I've ever had anywhere, ever.  The guacamole made at the table was fresh, and the addition of pomegranate seeds was a little curious, but ultimately delicious.   The service was top notch, coming to check on us a few times, and again...the BEST enchilada I've ever had. Amazing.  A little pricey, but it was worth it. This is a special occasion place for special food, in my opinion. Loved it, and 5 stars."}
{"text":"YUM! So far this is the best restaurant I've been to in Phoenix. The service was fantastic.  They made us feel like we were visiting their house for Sunday dinner.  The guacamole with pomegranate was extremely tasty and the fresh tortilla chips were some of the best I've had.  For entrees, I was between the shrimp or the fish tacos and asked the server for his advise.  He told me he'd suprise me.  Love it! I ended up with the fish tacos and they were some of the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Coming from San Diego, that's a pretty big feat.  My husband had the chili relleno with shrimp and scallops and it was soooo tastey! I really wish we would have saved room for dessert.  The flan or the churros looked unbelievable.  Next time!  I hardly ever give 5 stars so check this place out!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Barrio Cafe and we LOVED it. We had prompt, friendly service and the timing of the service was spot on. The happy hour tacos and drinks were perfect. My husband tried the duck tacos and was very pleased. I preferred the halibut. Both phenomenal. Next visit we will have to save room for dessert. Oh, did I mention the sangria? YUM!"}
{"text":"You know you're in for a fun experience as soon as you walk in the door. Vintage Mexican movie posters line the hallway, while works by local artists brighten the walls in the two dining rooms. The tables are lit by tall votive-candle glasses embossed with pictures and mini-bios of various saints. Be sure to visit the restroom - wildly painted, adorned with colorful tiles, and decorated with crucifixes, statues of the Virgin Mary, and pictures of Jesus, its somewhat irreverent and completely unexpected atmosphere is sure to stun you and make you smile. As will the food. Despite the name, there's nothing barrio about the cuisine, an eclectic mix of south-of-the-border dishes that eschews the typical combination platters that are geared towards gringo palates in favor of colonial Mexican cooking. As if to emphasize the fact that this is no Chevy's, the traditional chips and salsa are replaced by a basket of French bread with a tapenade of olives, garlic, and capers. Do not miss Guacamole Casero, which is prepared fresh tableside. A ripe avocado, moistened with olive oil, white vinegar, and a splash of balsamic vinegar, is mashed with onions, tomato, cilantro, and pomegranate seeds, and served with topopos (round, fried, chiplike corn tortillas). The chef best displays her successful break from the familiar with the entrees. Seared duck breast is sweet, spicy and tart, aided by the addition of a tamarind and chipotle sauce. Seafood enchiladas are comprised of blue corn tortillas rolled with scallops, cheese, and crab, and topped with a trio of meaty shrimp. The chile en nogada is a large poblano pepper stuffed with apples, pears, raisins, pomegranate seeds, chicken, and smothered in an almond cream sauce. The bar stocks nearly 200 brands of tequila, wine from Valle de Guadalupe in Baja California, and a variety of Mexican beers, in addition to domestic selections. The extraordinary quality of the food is not reflected in the prices - all entrees are $20.00 or less."}
{"text":"It's funny how the service can make or break an evening.   I'm a pretty easy going guy with a pretty high tolerance level, however if you piss off the wife you instantly are on my shit list! Starting obviously with the service, overall in the restaurant it seemed fine but our waiter Gabe was pretty bad. I wasn't sure if he really wanted us to be there. Do you care? Do you not want a tip? Is this your civil service?   On to the food...By far the best dish was the Quesadilla with Langostine Borracho. The langostine was cooked to perfection, it did have a bit of shell but that is something I can deal with. The goat cheese is the flavor that really put it over the top. Nice dish!   The chicken mole was also a winner, however it was lacking in quantity  department with the mole sauce. If you get this dish you typically are ordering it primarily for the sauce. Don't skimp!   The prices are also a bit hefty. The two ladies next to us got their bill and gasped, \"$95 for the two us!\" I don't think you should be surprised by the bill, after-all the prices are on the menu, however be forewarned!   They should get a 4 star for their food but unfortunately the service is still part of the deal. I would go back if I lived in the area minus Gabe to give it another shot."}
{"text":"For all the hype I can't say I was especially impressed. Maybe we had the wrong items but it seemed a bit pricey, a bit smarmy and definitely overrated. The service wasn't great, the food was ok.  I went once and never felt compelled to return. Perhaps one day I'll venture back. Perhaps not..."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative."}
{"text":"I've heard about this restaurant few times in the past so finally, I decided to try it out with my friend. The main reason for a 3 star rating was the level of service. Other than that, the food was average to good, and the restaurant itself was very quaint.  For parking, there is some parking in the back and there is a lot of street parking. Once parked, there is a front entrance located on the main road and there is an entrance in the back, entering from the parking lot. The host/hostess is in the front so you'd have to go there to get seated. The restaurant itself has a nice authentic ambiance to it and has an interesting layout. It has several different rooms with seating so it's not an \"open concept.\" It's not a problem. I actually like it but just pointing it out.  Anyway, once we were seated, our service was very absent and slow. It took a while for our waitress to do everything from bringing over menus, water, our food, etc...Her presence was lacking. For the prices we were paying for food, I had expected better service. Speaking of pricing, it was slightly pricey but the food was good. It wasn't the best I've had but I liked that my food wasn't overly greasy. It was tasty and had a good portion."}
{"text":"Well i been here food is good however the food can be a little bit overpriced.  Plates are huge maybe thats why so they can charge u 18 $ 19$ a plate. I only went there once. The one on 16st n thomas."}
{"text":"None better.  I've probably eaten here 10 or more times with various groups of people, and each time everyone involved was thrilled.  Here are some rules of thumb for a happy experience...1. Small crowded dining room with tile floor = lots of noise, so don't come here expecting explain the last ten years of your life to your half-deaf grandfather.  2.  Expect to wait...in the meantime, have a delicious margarita or three.  3.  Get the guacamole...worth every penny, especially when pomegranates are in season.  4.  Skip the bread...it's a Mexican restaurant after all.  5.  Pork tacos or enchilada suiza are the best things on the menu.  6.  Check out the restroom...be inspired.   7.  If you don't like this place, stop coming back so my wait will be shorter!"}
{"text":"Nice but not elegant atmosphere.  Cloth table coverings, great service and the food was very good.  Heavy on the onions but still good.  Definitely will go back even tho 40 miles away."}
{"text":"Incredible!  The chile en nogado is one of the most unique, creative, and tasty foods I've eaten. The enchilada suizas use grilled and tender chicken, a lovely flavor. But really, the nogado is memorable!! Bravo!"}
{"text":"What the heck, I just ate 15 minutes ago, and just searching for Barrio Cafe made me hungry for their guacamole, which is prepared at your table, mixed in with pomegranate seeds. Yeah...you've read right...POMEGRANATE SEEDS. Who thinks of adding that to guacamole? My oh my...the combination with sweet and savory just did wonders to my taste buds.  I had their Chiles en Nogada, which was recommended by the waiter. Oh wow. I seriously have never been served Mexican food like this before. Again, the beautiful battle of sweet and savory. Savory being the chicken and the chile. Sweet being everything else- apples, pecans, pears, apricots, almond sauce.   They had live music as well, so in case your sense of taste is in overload, relax for a sec and switch to your sense of hearing.  By the way...I LOVE THEIR SMALL PARKING LOT! It looks so dingy-ish, and since from the parking lot you enter the restaurant in the back...makes it feel like you're in on a scrumptious secret. Plus, the street wall art was extremely colorful...almost a hint to what your taste buds will experience, and enjoy.  Warning for huge groups...it's on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos are AMAZING! So happy I found this place just a few minutes away from my work"}
{"text":"Outstanding Chile En Nagado!  Went in on Mother's Day and was not disappointed!  There was a little wait time, so they brought out delicious guacamole and chips as well as bread with a tapenade.    I had the lime water which was so refreshing and the Chile En Nagado which was delightful!  I only had it twice before in Mexico and each version is a little different. What a joy!  My daughter and son in law went with the breakfast items... so many egg dishes to choose from but I was on a mission.  We invited a single elderly patron to join us.  He gave us the low down on the menu as he has visited frequently for Baseball season.  Ha ha he had 2 breakfasts and menudo that was a lot of food!  I was super happy it was flavorful without being spicy.  My kids dishes were very spicy for them.  Everyone has a difference in tolerence,  I'm all about flavor instead of spice.  My side dishes of squash and potatoes were delightful as well.  To be honest I boxed half and had the other part for dinner, so excellent portion sizes!  We enjoyed the live music as well.  The staff was great.  I would rather it take awhile and have fresh delicious food than mediocre food quickly!  I'm definitely coming back. I picked up an order of the Chile En Nagado to go for my Father and he was delighted as well!    **note  to self parking and entrance is in the rear of building."}
{"text":"Authentic yet upscale Mexican food, with a mole sauce to DIE for! This place is a little pricey, and popular on evenings and weekends, so better make a reservation."}
{"text":"While there are some interesting twists with the menu, the abysmal service here would overwhelm even the highest quality food. The guacamole topped with pomegranate seeds was nice and interesting. The cochinita pibil was disappointing. The spice blend of that dish overwhelmed the meat rather than enhanced it. The plate presentations were consistently sloppy and generally were a good metaphor for the overall lackadaisical experience. But the service was what will prevent us from returning. Our waiter \"Marcos\" acted as if he'd rather be wallowing in pig manure than waiting on us. Even something as minor as getting a drink refill seemed to require an act of Congress. He even brought the change back in a wet folder.  Apparently being featured on a Food Network show has inflated the egos of the staff here. The food here isn't all that impressive. The service is what will really leave a bad taste in your mouth. Not worth the hype, the wait or your money."}
{"text":"Had their chorizo con huevos and pressed coffee, great atmosphere, local art on the walls and rustic."}
{"text":"Not even worth it.. $130 for a family of 4. This is the PF Chiang's or worse of Mexican Food.. $5 horchata and $10 Churros? Comedor dela Guadalajara is still the bomb..."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch because the cafe was featured on DDD. If you are looking for a \"dive\" with \"dive\" prices you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for a white tablecloth gourmet experience this is your place. I had the famous chile en nogado and it was deliciously interesting. Having just hiked Camelback mountain I could have used more food, which I expected for the price. My husband had tacos with the specially prepared pork. They were good.  Great service."}
{"text":"I have actually eaten here several times. I am a big fan of the food, however, every time I come in, the service is just lacking. We won't let that keep us from continuing to eat here, as maybe it has just been bad luck on our end. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Wow the food here is fresh, super authentic and burst of with flavor. The area seems like the edge of the ghetto but it was still good. Staff was friendly and the art work on the wall made for good table conversation. Highly recommend coming to this place."}
{"text":"This is not the typical burrito and enchilada joint most people envision when thinking of Mexican food. It's much much better and brings together flavors from all over Mexico.  Barrio Cafe is not for everyone. If you have no sense of adventure or want standard fare, go to a chain or a drive-through. Want something different, yet absolutely delicious? Come here with an open mind and try as many different things as you can."}
{"text":"I had the  cochinita  pibil -  it's  pork ( Puerco asado) slow roasted  overnight ;w/ achiote &  sour  orange  wrapped in a banana leaf , pickled red onion &  pico de gallo topping. The  portion was plentiful &  enough to take home &  enjoy a  sandwich the next  morning  at  Sky Harbor  Airport.  The  spicy  mashed potatoes &  zucchini  side dishes  came w/ the meat & were very tasty. The Barrio Bomba  margarita was excellent  w/  orange  juice &  pineapple juice , &  Cointreau.  My  dining  partner  enjoyed her Pollock  of Pescado el  dia, also.  Our  server , Aaron , was friendly &  explained  the menu items . Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza was at the café  & it's  terrific to know  that she is an humanitarian as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. That is all you need to know. Make sure you try the sopa de chile marron'. Phenomenal. Great service here, the bonus."}
{"text":"CLOSED MONDAYS. Not in a great part of town. Park in back, or across the street. The day we visited CNN was doing a piece on the chef. Try the Guacamole (it has Pomegranate seeds) w very fresh tortillas). Filete de Tita ($26) Filet Mignon with Mash Potatoes with chorizo, Crab, Blue Cheese (smoky, Flavorful, spicy). Some overcooked some undercooked. Definitely get dessert &  coffee (big French press with a very robust coffee) a must is the Churros filled with Caramel."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem in Phoenix! Easily a top restaurant in the valley. We had the fresh guacamole made table side, the enchiladas suizas and the carne asada and pork tacos. We all kept looking at each other with amazement by how good everything was tasting. The place is small and quaint, but the ambience is so nice. They don't take reservations, so you may have to wait. But it's so worth it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! This place had my expectations super high. Was very dissapointed. Got the table side guac, was ok. Could make the same at home. Had both dishes shown on DDD. Wasn't super impressed. Sangria, was good, but not excellent.   This place is extremely small. There was a two hour wait. So husband and I killed our time going to the arcade bar down the street.   Was expecting a lot more from this place."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday at 7:30pm. We were a party of 2 and had to wait an hour and a half for a table.  Because of the expected wait, we left and came back after~30-40minutes. I think you have to let them know you're coming back so they don't assume you've given up. I agree that the waiting area is very small when busy. If it wasn't so cold outside, I wouldn't have minded sitting on the benches. I guess you have to be really patient!  Food: I got the tacos de pescado (fish tacos) and my friend got the cochinita pibil (slow roasted pork). My dish came with either a side salad or fries; i opted for the salad. The tacos were delicious. The fried halibut was not too greasy and the avocado was fresh and ripe! The drizzle of chipotle cream sauce was just enough to give it a little spice. Yummy! I tried my friend's pork, and I didn't enjoy it as much as my dish. He had a side of something that was SUPER spicy!!!!! I don't remember what it was called but it kinda resembled mashed potatoes. Portions were a good size, not too little, not too much.  For dessert, we shared the Churros. I was a little hesitant because I read it was filled with goat's milk caramel. I love churros, and i love caramel, but goat's milk caramel? I was pleasantly surprised. The churros were divine! I think it may have been too much for us since we'd eaten all of our food. But I'd say definitely go for the Churros if you have a little  room in your belly!!!!  The place was a little loud since they had live music and lots of people. The decor was nice, not super fancy which I like.  Our server was very helpful in my choice of dish.    PROS: great fish tacos. AWESOME churros. good service. CONS: Wait during busy times (they don't take reservations either...boo), parking is supposedly tough since parking lot in the back is quite tiny though. We were able to park down the street no problem."}
{"text":"I will give it 5 starts as the food is awesome !!! Incredible good and specially the dessert. The cajeta sweet crepe is over the top. Sadly, the service is the worst I have ever seen in my entire life. The hosted is a grumpy, rude and lack of manner girl that also wrote down my name as a female and when I corrected her she just make fun of it. The waiters are terrible to the extend that the guy throws the guacamole all over the table. I did tip well :-)"}
{"text":"Love me some Barrio.  The Barrio is one of those restaurants that you bring your visiting friends and relatives to. The place is tiny for sure and you most likely will have to wait, but have a cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is more from Southern Mexico and completely different from the other options in town. I have loved everything I have ever tried here. The guac that they make at your table is a nice show for visitors and natives alike. The service is always good and the crowd is always lively. Give it a try sometimes, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Food was different but very delicious. Aaron was great! He made eating here a great experience."}
{"text":"Okay the first time there last Saturday, recommended by coworker Maria wife of Yolie who know the owner.  Popped in about 330 pm told half out wait.  Was able to squeeze in at the bar.  Let me just say Richard is fantastic.   Kinda over did it on the food, appetizer stuffed jalapeños- great.  Then the pozole-fantasti.  Went for a double main,  the filet and the Verde enchiladas.  The file cane with a red and red wine reduction sauce jalapeño mad and calabasas or zucchini wowsa. The verde enchiladas had grilled tortillas and a wonderful sauce.  Topped it off with the vanilla stuffed churros with ice cream, Carmel and whipped cream.    The food was wonderful, really busy now during the season.  Will be back want to try the brunch.  Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"It's pretty good but a little pricey for what you get..the tacos are really small!  Good flavor..I had carne asada tacos..u get 4 small tacos..very tasteful but tiny..finished dish in like 2 minutes!  The Jamaica Margarita was pretty good but also small..it had Gran Mariner in it which was a nice kick! ($13)..another thing is that the server barely payed attention to us and was only looking after the larger tables."}
{"text":"Wow! The food here definitely got my nipples hard! They served some kind of mashed potato and it was super flavorful! Pozole was hearty and the entree was amazing (I don't know what it was but it was tender and packed with flavor!)"}
{"text":"The two things that jettison my brain into a Barrio Cafe daydream are:  1)  The Sangrita 2)  The Churro dessert  In fact, if this place was called \"Barrio Sangrita and Churro Shop\", i would still want to run up to the building and give it a big hug.  Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.  I prefer going to BC for brunch on Sunday.  I enjoy that menu the best.  Oh, and the table side Guac is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wow.  The perfect combination of creative and authentic.  Small, funky, hip and intimate.  Great service, killer ingredients, and a fun atmosphere.  We literally loved this place; oh, and we are serious foodies.  Guacamole was a fresh spin on a classic, yet truly scrumptious.  We devoured it.  Tacos - slow roasted Mayan pork - were crazy delicious.  The serving was 4, with double corn tortillas, so I divided them and made 8 tacos - holy mackerel, they were good!  My wife won the Mexican food lottery, however: Chile Relleno Nogales or something like that.  It was sweet and spicy; a chile stuffed with cheese, fruit, nuts, and lightly layered in a sweet, nutty sauce.  Literally the best Mexican dish I've ever tasted (including in Mexico itself).  It combined the best of savory and sweet.  We didn't leave a single morsel on the plate.  Amazing.  Tip:  order a simple margarita (off the menu), with tequila, lime and agave nectar.  So simple, yet so tasty."}
{"text":"A couple of co-workers and I ventured out to the \"Barrio\" this afternoon for lunch.  If you do plan to go for your lunch hour, carpool with co-workers because parking is very limited and plan for an extended lunch because you very well might spend over an hour here. We showed up at noon, not packed at all, however, our service was very slow. The time it took our server to take our order, deliver our food and drop our check seemed way too long. The seating is uncomfortable and may be a little crowded for those with space issues.   However, the food is great! If you're one to overlook the aforementioned cons, then you will love the Barrio hands down! In lieu of chips and salsa, you will be served bread and tapenade. Try the Guacamole, made fresh upon order and is served with tostada chips. This Gauc is really good!!!!  I had the Torta de Pollo - grilled chicken breast served on a warm pannini style bread and slathered with great flavors. But wait! Don't stop there.. You have got to leave room for  Postres! OMG!!!!! The Churros Rellenos KICK!!!! These are not to be confused with the Churros you may have had at Disney Land. These Churros are served with warm caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and candied walnuts. It is a crime to not have these fritters.    I struggled giving 5 stars because of the lack of parking, slow service, and uncomfortable seating. However, This will not stop me from making another trip to the Barrio.    See you there!"}
{"text":"The food makes this place. Everything was delicious. We had the carne asada tres tacos, and the poblano torta. The food was pricey compared to most places and the quality of meats, cheese and veggies explain why. It was packed when we got there and the service was a bit slow however not bad. Do not expect a turn and burn or fast food atmosphere take your time and enjoy. That reminds me the seats are not the most comfortable and your packed into a small room all that aside the food and drinks are worth the trip especially if you have never been there."}
{"text":"We came here for HH.  Great selection and reasonable priced.  The regular menu is a bit pricey for the amount you get but the food is good.  The place is small and you bump chairs with your fellow diners.  I got the Pescado Tacos, good but small portion.  The service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Always good. Sometimes have to wait awhile to get a table but has always been worth it. Go early if you don't want to wait to long for a table."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for years, but living in chandler we don't make it up that way all too often.  Last week though my 13 year old had an ATV accident and was moved to phoenix children's hospital.  3 nights in, the bf and I were sooooo tired of the cafeteria food that we decided to duck out for a real dinner while the boy was sleeping.  A quick yelp search and I saw that Barrio Cafe was within walking distance!  Score!  So we headed out.  Now being from chandler, we were caught a little off guard as we approached the intersection of Thomas and 16th st.   We weren't in the suburbs anymore, that's for sure.  As we headed down 16th st. past the graffiti and storefronts with bars on the windows, we started wondering if we should have driven.  But then 50 ft ahead we saw the restaurant.  Yes!  We got there around 5:15 so it wasn't busy and we were seated immediately.  Cute place.  Small, charming, with a cute, but really small wood bar by the entrance.  Our waiter came by right away and recommended the Lowrider margarita so we each ordered one.  This is a very authentic tasting margarita.  Lots of tequila, a little bit of lime.  Very strong...but at $12 bucks a pop we each only needed one.  They brought out bread with an olive tapenade, I think.  Really good!  I knew I wanted to try their table side guacamole with the pomegranate seeds and I'm glad we did!  Very yummy!  Great chips too!  Our waiter made some great recommendations, but knowing we were already going to be almost full from bread and guacamole, we opted for tacos.  I had a combo order of the shrimp tacos and the halibut.  The bf got the tacos de carne asada.  Everything was fabulous!  You get 4 with each order and I had to discard the tortillas after two so I could finish them.  They come with either fries or salad.  We were confused about fries coming with tacos, but that's a Spanish thing I guess, so the bf got fries, I got salad.  Great little salad, but boy were those fries good!  They come with a chipotle ketchup and just taste great!  All in all, a great meal, and a great distraction from the stress of my son's accident.  I'd definitely like to go again and try something other than the tacos.  Btw....the boy is ok.  Recovering nicely!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Barrio Cafe, you know what I'm going to say. If you haven't, get there immediately. You won't find better Mexican food. Ever. But don't expect chips and salsa and a burrito. This place is authentic Mexican, with a French twist. The chiles en nogada is the signature dish here; it's a symphony of flavors your palette has never experienced. But that's just the beginning. Also try the pescada del mar, which is a wonderful blend of fish, crab, scallops and chorizo. The house made guacamole is fantastic, and don't forget the churros with goat's milk caramel for dessert. Simply the best. Chef Silvana is a culinary genius."}
{"text":"Guacamole with pomegranate seeds made table side is amazing!  Salad with dinner so good.  We were a walk in party of 5 and didn't have to wait too long while every table was filled.  Unique menu.  Three taco choices were ample and tasty.  Carmel Churros unbelievable dessert!  Elegant Mexican dining."}
{"text":"The menu cover was right. \"Comida chingona\" is the only way to describe the cuisine here. Although I had a savory experience, the service was at times awkward. Was my server having a bad day? Hungover? Tired? I don't know, but he didn't make me feel comfortable. At one point he just left without letting me know someone else would be taking care of me. I was waiting for him to come back and he never did. Another man just started talking to me and I didn't even know he was my new server.  Anyway, let's not punish the food on behalf of my server's lack of professionalism. Yes, they served bread with tapenade instead of chips and salsa. So? I was actually happy to see something else being offered. Everyone can serve that, but tapenade? I've actually never had it before but have been meaning to try it. Now I know what it tastes like. Be open to try new things, even at a Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the corn chowder and chile en nogada for my meal. The chowder was probably the best thing out of this whole ordeal. It was sweet without being overbearing and it had a similar taste to a warm cup of cornmeal. I've had corn chowders before but this was different. The corn was definitely the distinguished guest. I didn't even care about the shrimp. It was that good.  I love chiles rellenos and have always wanted to try the other variation: chiles en nogada. Unfortunately I've had a tough time seeing them in menus until now. It took a while for it to be cooked, but the wait was worth it. Albeit, the chile itself is not spicy, the contents are sweet and fresh. Chicken combined with raisins and other fruit was a different spin to Mexican food. I'm all about spice and heat, and I liked the cooler aspect of this dish. The almond sauce is light and the pomegranates add tiny explosive bursts of flavor.  The side vegetables were good as well. I'll be honest though, this was the first time I've seen a Mexican restaurant serve mashed potatoes as a side dish. But hey, I'm open to new things! I loved the idea of having the horchata inside recycled Coke bottles. It was refreshing in both concept and flavor. I don't like too much sugar, and this horchata had the perfect sweetness to it. What I would do for some corn chowder and horchata from a Coke bottle...  I was REALLY tempted to try the churros filled with cajeta, but I didn't dare. I was extremely full. Thank you for the food, even though I had to put up with some messed up service to obtain in."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have enjoyed since living in Phoenix (1 year so far). Didn't know what to expect. Originally I was thrown off as they serve complimentary bread instead of chips- but to my delight, the ciabatta with olive tapenade was \"deelish.\" My spicy margarita was outstanding.  Our super personally server suggested I go with the chicken molé--- FANTASTIC! I was so full but I couldn't stop- it was like crack.  Thank you. I will be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Barrio Cafe based from reviews posted. We arrived at 4:00 and finally left at 6:15. Very slow service. Food was ok and overpriced. We will not visit Barrio Cafe again when there are other Mexican Restaurants equally good and affordable."}
{"text":"You ever have an experience where in the middle of it, you realize that you are at the pinnacle - the zenith - of that particular type of experience?  It was my last night in Phoenix and hap and circumstance led us to Barrio Cafe.  My Karma must be fabulous right now, as I tell you without hyperbole that it was the best meal I have ever had.  Filet mignon topped with Mexican crab meat and goat cheese coupled with two top shelf margaritas. I almost balked as I think the margaritas were $9 and the steak $25-ish (more than I'm usually inclined to spend) but hey - last night of the vacation so why not.  I tried to savor it, but I just wanted to gorge myself on it.  It was so tasty that words fail me.  I know that some day if I find myself on death row, this is the meal I will request.  I will not be surprised if the sheer ecstasy of the meal kills me first."}
{"text":"It seems kind of funny to me that both in Seattle and Phoenix, you have to wait in line for half an hour for good Mexican food.  In any case, I we lucked out and hit the Barrio on a Friday morning around 11.  It was busy, but no problems landing a table.  I grabbed a peach margarita and would have to say it was not only worth the $7, it would have been worth $17.  For lunch, the carne asada and pork tacos were both outstanding.  Also a nice surprise was the fries with super tangy chipotle sauce.    A little busy, a little pricey, but I don't think you'll mind either once you get a taste of the menu here."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here again! I started off with their Crema de Elote soup which is a delicious corn chowder topped with spice-rubbed shrimp. It was sweet, salty, warm with little pieces of corn which gave it a nice texture. It was a delicious, perfect soup!  I also got their famous Chile en Nogada. It's a roasted large green chile pepper stuffed with pieces of chicken and dried fruit in this red sauce, topped with a delicious, creamy almond sauce. All the flavors were perfect together, I especially liked the creamy almond sauce. Definitely unique and delicious!  I couldn't finish the horchata, served in a Coke bottle, so got that to go. All in all a delicious meal. Several tables around me got multiple orders of their tacos so that seems pretty popular. Glad I came back again!  Also, they have a location at the airport, I was flying Southwest so if you can't eat here for some reason, you can at least grab the same food at the airport!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review and I couldn't think of a better place to pop my proverbial cherry. So I am a creature of habit and the two times I have been to Barrio I think I have gotten the same exact meal from start to finish. I would say hands down just as good as the first time!   Let me start by saying I had never tried guacamole in my life due to the look of the consistency of it. I have a problem with that with some foods. But what better way to try something then being called out by a chick. So, I tried it and it was amazing! Now not having anything to compare it to may make this less reliable, but... The pomegranate that they mash into it was great. It sort of cut through the creaminess. I had the Adobo Pork and for those meat-eaters out there it will not disappoint. For dessert I have had the churro. Unbelievable! For those of us that have only had a fair or Disneyland churro in our lifetimes, this was like a religious experience. It is served very warm with cinnamon ice cream I think.   Be prepared to wait for a table or go later in the night because it is smaller and very popular. Oh yeah, the Sangria is tasty!!!"}
{"text":"The type of Mexican food you would find deep in Mexico... Not all fried like most Mexican places. So fresh and amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a day at the water park because hubby was craving mole. We knew they served it here but had never tried it before. We were seated at a table and the waiter came to take our drink order after a little bit of a wait. We both ordered sangrias and we both loved the taste of them. They brought us a basket of bread with an olive tapenade that was quite tasty. We decided to start with the tableside guacamole that I had heard so much about. It was very good and the addition of the pomegranate seeds made it in my opinion. Hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. It came with a side of calabasitas (zucchini and corn). To be honest he wasn't that impressed with it. The mole sauce was a bit too strong and tasted a little burnt. I had ordered the Chiles en Nogada which the waiter had recommended and it was divine. Unfortunately we did not save room for dessert however we did order two of their Horchatas to take with us. They were just as good as a dessert I could've easily have a drink another one. All in all we did enjoy our meal and will probably be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, my disclaimer is that I think I would have enjoyed Barrio Cafe much better as a smaller group. We were a group of 10 and knowing that they didn't take reservations, we were expecting to wait so that wasn't a real issue. However we did wait over an hour while every other group of 5 or less walked in the door and was seated immediately. I have worked in the restaurant business so I know that it isn't easy to seat large parties in a small dining room, but what was a little disappointing was that once we were seated, the service was slow. It took us quite a while to get drinks at the table and even water was a bit of a wait. Then ordering our food was another wait. The restaurant was constantly busy so my thought is that maybe they are under-staffed.  That being said, the bartender was great. While waiting for over an hour in their tiny bar space, we were served appetizers and drinks. The drinks are terrific and their tequila selection, impressive! However, I was underwhelmed by the food and we had mixed responses at the table. I ordered the Granada con Flor de Jamaica - A large pork chop served with pomegranate and hibiscus flower port reduction, crispy shallots and a candied hibiscus flower. I thought the sauce was fantastic and the pork chop was quite good, but slightly overcooked for my liking. (I know people still prefer their pork somewhat well done, but it doesn't need to be!) I don't recall crispy shallots, but maybe I missed them. The potatoes served with the dish were very tasty but barely warm and the zucchini side was - eh. Some of the other dishes at the table were the  Enchiladas del Mar - Blue corn tortillas filled with quesos Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream reduction. Way too heavy on the cheese for my taste (and the person who ordered it). The Pollo en Mole - Spice rubbed, pan seared chicken breast topped with a bold and flavorful Mole de Oaxaca was good. Again the sauce was a winner.   So there is definite talent in the kitchen, but not a home run for me or my guests. If I were local, I would probably try them again with a group of 4 or less. Being an out-of-towner, there are too many other spots to try in the area, so it may be a while before I return.  P.S.  I just realized their menu says \"grilled to order\" under the pork chop entree's. I was never asked how I wanted it grilled so that could have resolved the \"too well done\" issue for my pork..."}
{"text":"Great food their pork is awesome !!!!  The slow cooking made this dish superb.   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get! Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great.  The place was very busy with allot of energy."}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I've ever praised a restaurant for its tortillas.  They were the highlight of my pork tacos for sure.  The flavor and seasoning of the pork was all there, but I was surprised by how the meat appeared cubed instead of shredded.  Perhaps it contributed to the few tough pieces I chewed?  If I were to do it again, I think I would have tried the shrimp tacos or one of the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Such a treat! My first visit to ArIzona and I wanted great food! Well we got more with the colorful decor and the lively atmosphere.  This is not traditional \"combination\" dinner plate Mexican restaurant.  The menu is created by a Chef, and adventurous one who knows how to pull all the unusual ingredients together.  For starters the table-side prepared guacamole included pomegranate seeds. Odd, but delicious. Also the free starter was sliced French bread with a delicious Italian inspired tomatoe and onion relish.   My halibut with puréed hibiscus flowers was very good... Although the fish was slightly over cooked.   I enjoyed the  variety of freshly made homemade Mexican."}
{"text":"Not your standard Mexican food here so be prepared. I had the chicken enchiladas with a green tomatillo sauce with Mexican crema. Not spicy but very tasty and they will definitely fill you up. Had the guacamole as well which is made table side with pomegranate seeds. Sounds weird but it's as actually very good. Try it. Also had a frozen mango Margarita. Made very well. This place will have you look at Mexican food in a different way. A good way."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican cuisine. Staff were friendly! The environment is fun with live music and always busy atmosphere. I had the house margarita and I was impressed by the bartender attention to detail and being a good bartender. He noticed a piece of cilantro fell into my margarita and immediately took it away and made me a new drink even though I said it was fine and I would drink it that way. He than responded with I want you to have the absolute best margarita not a just fine margarita. We didn't wait too long for a table and was sat 30 minutes later. (No reservations) the food was so good we got the queso Blanca dip for appi and I got chile pollo poblano in white sauce it was so yummy! Would totally recommend coming to try this restaurant out!!"}
{"text":"Four stars due to the generally very good but way too loud live music.  We were unable the hear the waitress or the other couple at our table.  Appetizer included very tender shrimp and fresh corn tortilla. The expensive guac was excellent as usual, but the roll up cart for the guac production would not fit in between the tables so we missed the \" show.\"  The drinks at the bar were fresh tasting and refreshing considering the 110 degree heat. My mole chicken was tender, the sauce appropriately spicy. Churro desert was split between four adults.  Lots of chocolate and caramel, although churro was not crispy.  Overall fun for groups."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to keep it honest. This place let me down. Big time.  I started by ordering a couple drinks. I had the La Bomba & my boyfriend went for their Lowrider. My drink was eh good? His tasted like pure tequila. I mean it was top shelf but still.. He wanted a mixed drink not shots of tequila.   Their complimentary bread and salsa was odd to me. I kept an open mind and dived in. Just wrong.. The salsa had an extremely unique taste. Honestly it shouldn't even be considered salsa. We ordered they infamous guacamole, BLAND. I'll just stop there with the apps.     I ordered their camaron tacos w/ a side of spicy papas. Pretty tasty. But nothing life changing.   The atmosphere.. Where to start. They had a band? that night which had the volume on waaaay to high. The gentlemen sitting at the table behind us was literally yelling at the top of his lungs to converse with his company. It was ridiculous. Our waitress even rolled her eyes towards the direction of the music and made a comment which of course I couldn't hear over the noise.   We skipped dessert.. Unfortunately. Due mainly to the fact that during our entire meal we were waited on by our waitress maybe twice. Once when we ordered and second to drop off the check. Pathetic. If it wasn't for her 20% gratuity that they so gracious added on themselves, she would have received close to nothing for a tip.   And that concludes my Barrio Cafe review. I really looked forward to dining here but that was the first and last time I will be visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE!  And I'm a huge foodie who has eaten at a lot of great Mexican restaurants. This is my family's all time favorite restaurant!  No, it's not cheap, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!  Incredible food from an incredible chef. Believe the hype.  There is a reason why chef Silvana has been written up in various magazines and has been nominated multiple times for a James beard award. Notable items on the menu include- guacamole, the elote appetizer, all soups on the menu are to die for, the pescado del mar, the seafood enchiladas, the cochinita pibil, The low rider margarita, and all of their desserts( in particular the churros). I've never had anything here I didn't think was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the green Chile Posole (Hominy & Pork soup/stew), the soup was great. The service was excellent and very friendly as a friendly neighborhood café should be. Our waiter was an ex-boxer and we talked for a while on his experiences in San Diego, Ca. It was a great experience, I would most definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were the best we've ever had! We went on a busy Sunday lunchtime and everyone else was having brunch but we had heard amazing things about their tacos. We ordered pork carnitas, carne asada, and pescado tacos. All were delicious but the fish was the best. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The fish tacos here are freakin awesome.  I also had a dish that was a pepper stuffed duck and pomegranite that was soo good.  Again, Phoenix food is terrible except the mexican food (see review for Los Sombrero's).  Their isn't a lot of seating available so reservations are a plus.  Also, no chips and salse, instead bread and tapanade.  That loses some points, but the fish tacos and other food make up for it.  Desserts are so-so, but mexican dessert isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"The area looks rather ghetto but the restaurant itself is fantastic. The best thing is the salsa cart where you can pick and choose your own ingredients and the waiter will make it fresh for you right there. It's rather pricey but consider your other options are Sonics are places with so-so tasting diner-style food, it's worth it.  I really enjoyed the live music and would definitely return here again if I'm ever in town."}
{"text":"Everything Chef Silvana creates is a masterpiece. While known for its playful and street savvy \"Comida Chingona\" tagline, there is no denying that the Barrio brand is home to the most sophisticated dishes in all of Arizona.   Their pomegranate laced guacamole is my favorite, along with the Camaron Borracho quesadilla (garlic and tequila shrimp with goat cheese on tiny corn tortillas). Simply unbeatable. It's outrageous to read some of these lukewarm reviews and proves that although progressing nicely, this city still needs guidance on recognizing the many styles of Mexican cuisine. So what if there aren't yellow cheese topped Chimichangas on the menu.. That's the beauty of it!   Of all the exquisite projects Chef Silvana brings to life, this particular location will always be my favorite. In addition to its edible offerings, Barrio Cafe showcases the works of Arizona's most respected artists, a community collaboration known as \"Calle 16\". This genuine love and celebration of culture is in a word, inspiring."}
{"text":"Mere words cannot describe the wonderful meal we had at Barrio. The mole was fresh and so light you could identify each component. Service was attentive and eager to explain the menu. This food was made with love and decades of tradition."}
{"text":"Just another tourist visiting Barrio Cafe. Lovely restaurant, with excellent service and approachable menu, though a little expensive.  I do think is a must try place after eating here like most of the guides say.  Agua de Horchata: I could drink this all day. I usually don't like cinammon but it worked so well with the rice water. Gotta figure out how to make this :)  Guacamole del Barrio: made table side at dinner, comes with chips. Guac was so fresh and clean.   Suiza Enchiladas: the white sauce is truly incredible.  The chorizo and chicken were nicely seasoned and cooked. It is really filling."}
{"text":"The food is good ... but a bit over priced, even though the portions are large. I have eaten there several times. The Barrio Cafe is very small. So if you are looking for an intimate spot, this is not it."}
{"text":"The food is as good as everyone says it is...it's just another level here. Guacamole is a must- with the seasonal pomegranate seeds or without. Order the Cochinita Pibil and experience what Mexican food is like without a ton of yellow cheese melted on top of it. Enjoy the gorgeous art on the walls inside and outside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Few months ago I was in Phoenix for a conference and realized a feature triple d joint was around the corner from my hotel. I ended up at this location two times and the other location (barrio cafe Gran reserva) once. Mind you I was only in the area for four nights! I chose to eat at the bar both times- which was great- tiny but no one was there at same time as me so it worked . Bartenders both nights were very friendly . I ordered the same thing both times - cochinita pibil - and I continue to dream about it months later. I have never tasted anything as succulent and simple but with complex flavor profile - I take my hat off to Chef Silvana- please open a restaurant in NYC!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome murals outside.  I ordered the mango salad and it was very good and presented very beautifully.  My only complaint is that the food seemed expensive for the amount of food.  Overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"Interesting Mexican. A different take on the standards. Very fresh.  Chips are a bit greasy and not to par in my opinion for this place.   Very good place and I recommend it but I don't see the \"the best Mexican\"  Great service.   I didn't have the drinks but I am sure they are excellent"}
{"text":"This place is a little off the beaten track unless you live in the neighborhood, but it well worth seeking out. It's not far from the Phoenix Art Museum and the Heard, and makes a great stop before or after a trip to one of the museums if you're trying to think of a fun outing with visiting friends or family and want to impress and convince them to keep coming back. If you don't like your family that much, and don't want them to come too often, then don't take them here.  You can't go wrong with any dish, but the Cochinita Pibil is one of their specialties, and the guacamole with pomegranate seeds is a surprising treat. It's worth going just for that."}
{"text":"I knew when I moved to Phoenix I would experience some top-notch Mexican food,but Barrio exceeded all expectations. The guacamole is one of a kind and CANNOT be missed. I had the shrimp tacos and they were perfection!  The cabbage was crisp the shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauce was magnificent. This is the place I will bring all of my out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Yet another place that has a reputation for good food and long ass lines. Another $40 meal that left me unsatified and confused. I'm left with these questions on my mind during and after the meal. What are the other people eating and are we in the wrong place?   The food here does not live up to the lore painted on the colorful walls and menu. The bread and dip brought out while we ordered was stale and the dip was unmemorable. My wife insisted that we order the guacamole. I was not a fan of the flavor combinations of pomegranate and lime. It was Sunday, so we ordered from the brunch menu. I had the enchiladas verde and was extremely disappointed. The enchiladas were okay in certain places but mostly tasted like something I could cook at home myself. I absolutely hated everything else on the plate from the soupy and over sweetened verde sauce, burned potatoes and pico de gallo that was just out of place on the dish.   At least the place was not crowded. I would have had to ask for a refund if I waited 2 hours like I've heard people do. The live music was cool and the place had a nice atmosphere. The only thing missing was good food."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, period. I adore the esquites, quesadilla cameron, and the goats milk caramel churros... I would easily give it five stars, HOWEVER they frequently turn off the ringer on their phone so we can never call in and order takeout! When asked about it we were told by one of the owners that, \"We do it on purpose, in house customers are more important - but we answer during lunch!\" (WTH?!) Meanwhile, the phone rings on silent while the hostess ensures her Snapchat is updated every 30 seconds.  We are frequently in house customers as well, it would be really nice to enjoy our favorite dishes in house or from our couch. Sadly after the last interaction I'm not sure we will be such frequent guests."}
{"text":"Great environment, live guitar, delicious food, and excellent service!!!!  I would highly recommend checking Barrio Cafe out!!!"}
{"text":"Had to come to this place because of all the great things I've heard. Should have looked into it a little more because it was definitely more pricey than I anticipated. This place is tiny so prepare to wait. However, service was good. My husband and I both ordered tortas and they were delicious!! When we can afford it, we'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Me and my wife ate there for the first time after viewing the show diners, drive ins and dives. The food was amazing took flavor to another level, drank a michelada while waiting excellent drinks. Worth the wait, good service as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  One of my two favorite spots in AZ so far.    The lobster quesadilla is awesome.  not your typical quessadilla but way way better.  the flank steak torta was very good too.  i can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We started off with fresh, yet strange tasting guac.  They make it at your table - avocado, lime (not enough), onions, cilantro and dried cranberries.  Yes, dried cranberries.  Sound funny?  Well, let me tell you, it tastes just as funny as it sounds.  Its a very weird sensation to be eating guacamole with chips and chewing on cranberries.   I wanted it to work out, but it just didn't. I ordered the seafood enchiladas for my entree.  They were so banal that I didn't even go for dessert.  I do have to mention that I tried my husband's duck entree and it was pretty darn good.  But still, that means this place is batting .33 which is not a good record for a moderate-high priced Mexican restaurant.    Also, I would rate this a $$$ and not a $$."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and lucky for me, it wasn't too busy. We were seated right away and my date and I ordered the Tacos Camaron (shrimp tacos) and the Torta Poblano. The waiter was slow and took forever to place our order, get refills, and give us our check. Pretty annoying...  However, the food was incredibly good. I practically ate more than I should of but, I could not stop eating. The shrimp was delightful and tasty, the torta poblano was just as good. Before tip, our bill was less than $30.   I am definitely a fan of the food. The service needs some improvement."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice mexican restaurant to have a nice meal with my wife and found Barrio café online.  When we got there it seemed very small. As I entered I was told by a not so courteous girl (she seemed to be new and not very good with people) that it would be at least 45 min to and hour wait. As the place is small but interesting we decided to wait it out. Finally after 45 minutes they called us. We got seated to a small table with artsy chairs and table, the place is interesting because of the Mexican artsy objects. The waiter was very nice and the menu looked promising , everything in the menu was very pricy but we figured the meals would make up for the high prices. My wife ordered enchiladas suizas and i ordered enchiladas with black mole. When the meals arrived I immediately noticed there where no rice and beans , and I thought to myself seriously ?? Really ?? I asked the waiter if I could order 2 side orders of rice for our meals and he said \"oh we don't have rice and beans.  I was stunned because normally all mexican restaurants serve rice and beans with the meals.  But we were so hungry that we accepted it because we have waited to long to eat. The food was good but it didn't satisfy my hunger , each plate was $22 and for that price I would have got a killer meal at and upscale Mexican restaurant with all the bells and whistles , so therefore we do not recommend  this place very pricey and not worth the wait. It's a cute place but not worth the money. After paying $67 I was still hungry"}
{"text":"It's sad, but I really like my chips and salsa (complimentary or not) when I go out for Mexican food. Barrio has a buschetta-esque chips and salsa substitute that no one really liked.  I had a Sergio el Suave (tequila, pineapple, lime juice, candied jalapeno, etc) to start. It was actually a bit spicy and interesting.  We had the queso as an app, and most of us got tacos, which come with \"spicy\" fries or a salad. I tried both and liked both. Everyone polished off their fries.   The brunch menu looked like something worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great place to go after work! Great service and tasty food. The bar is well stocked and the staff are knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Great service! Neat place! Live music! Nothing negative to say. We went on a Saturday around 6pm and I think that's just right on time before it get's crowded and you have to wait. The place it's small so big parties may have to be patient and wait. First thing we ordered was the Kuali de Camaron; amazing taste! A combinationof spicy and creamy and all things good, with tastefull chorizo and a perfectly marinated shrimp, the goat cheese just adds perfection to it, all on top of a crispy totopo.Your tastebuds will be very happy; just typig this makes my mouth watery!  You def have to try the tamarindo agua fresca. It's a must. Doesn't feel artificial at all and you can tell it's freshly made, you get the tamarindo pulp in it and the sweetness to it it's the right amount.  Our main entree, fish tacos and chicken suiza enchiladas. The tacos are a very good size and they are great option if you're not adventurous to try something different. They're def satisfying, though. The enchiladas: you get 5-6 enchiladas so it's a very generous portion. They have to be the best I've tried. Just look at the pictures. Oh, this place is not you average price, not a 10dll plate but it's totally worth it. Our check was about $65 for two."}
{"text":"If you're a foodie put this place on your list. Very creative culinary experience. Just won the award for best Mexican restaurant in US. Perhaps a bit generous. But a great experience."}
{"text":"Horrible attitude here! Unaccommodating when we had one extra person show up at our table."}
{"text":"(Have been back now three times since the original review.  This place is awesome.  I've had drinks, coffee, appetizers and a bunch of different entrees with my wife.  Everything is good.)  I went in to this place to hear a couple of my music buddies play near the beginning of 2010.  I knew nothing of the food or the place.  Because I was by myself, I got a table immediately which was not normal on a Saturday.  (There was a line out of the door at 8:30pm.)  I got to the third item on the menu as described below:  \"C H I L E S  en  N O G A D A Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions,garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sacue and pomegranates $21\"  I didn't read any further.  This is what I ate.  It was one of the most interesting and tasty entrees I have ever had in Phoenix.  I was thinking about it all week,  I tried to describe it to my wife but I couldn't.  The people who claim that the parking and neighborhood are less than ideal are not lying, but it's not that bad.   Honestly, I would risk having my car stolen to eat this food.  Heck, I might risk stealing your car to have this food.  Look, if you want safe, I'm sure you have a Chili's near your house that will gladly allow you to share your money with them.  I want to give the place 5 stars, but I think all I had was this one entree and probably water.   I remember liking the olive and bread that came before the meal, but my recollection is blurred by the Chiles en Nogada.  I really need to go back to verify if this will be a long term thing or a one-time fling."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio twice now.  Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.    Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.    I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.  Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).  The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.  I don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Honest review. Good food. Too expensive. Let's not kid ourselves and try to up sell delicious Mexican food. Not a fan of the whole \"upscale\" Mexican food image. Too pricey."}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent service! Funky art! Not your typical Mexican restaurant! Love it!"}
{"text":"Fly here, eat there. Do it! I had the Chile en Nogada and the first few bites were so emotional that I cried. I will be back, possibly tomorrow for lunch. So much more to try!"}
{"text":"Don't expect typical tacos, enchiladas or burritos and the prices that go along with traditional food. Thus restaurant is what I would call modern Mexican.  My roasted pork plate  had a Mexican version of mashed potatoes with a side  of zucchini-$20. The dish was very good. No tortilla chips upon arrival ; they use French bread with a tapenade. Soup: corn chowder. We also had filet steak tacos-3 for $12 and came with salad. Chips and guacamole were very different. I liked them but probably wouldn't order again-$11."}
{"text":"A diamond in this rough neighborhood. Be prepared to wait, most nights it's very busy. Order one of their amazing margarita's and try to relax in their very limited space. I've tried a couple of things, but by far the best item is their seasonal Chiles en Nogada. Be sure to order their Guacamole, they make it right in front of you and add the fun twist of pomegranate seeds to the mix. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"A very big disappoint extremely underwhelmed. Here is the problem with Chef inspired restaurants not everybody in the restaurant as inspired as the chef is. Very simple I ordered Rojas cheese enchiladas for $19 they brought me 3 street corn tortilla with enchilada sauce cilantro sprouts and the 2 eggs over easy that I did order. First thing I noticed sitting on top was the eggs were slightly undercooked this is bad... Can't cook an egg correctly. It was amazing the  corn tortillas had nothing inside I looked everywhere for the cheese even on the bottom of the plate no cheese they were literally corn tortillas with enchilada sauce. Now just think about that to roll up a corn tortilla and not notice anything inside meat or cheese was missing you would have to deliberately wilfully with disregard roll up the tortillas and place them on the plate. The wait staff was undetstaffed they don't have any quality control they serve the plate without even looking at it, really you pick up food you don't look at it before you serve it?... Jack N is correct Chef Esperaza has lost control of this restaurant first time here I will never come back. What a shame.. no way in hell can I possibly recommend this restaurant to anybody...another Triple D disaster."}
{"text":"Too much good stuff to choose just one.  Hands down the signature stuffed poblano is a must order.   Don't waste your time eating the  bread they bring to the table as you'll regret you wasted the stomach space .   Queso is just as menu reads and is an explosion of flavors.   Grab a bag of coffee too to take home.  A definite local spot I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing; the food, atmosphere, art, and staff. Not only is Chef Sylvana sharing her culture and food but she also contributes to the community in numerous ways."}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't already - the fantastic guacamole (probably the best I've ever tasted), the addicted spicy fries and even-spicer ketchup, and the knock-your-socks-off-fan-freakin-tastic cochinita pibil. All incredible. I'd fly back to Phoenix just to eat here again. Til next time Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"Does anyone else think it strange for a Mexican cafe to serve mediocre Bread instead of chips and salsa?   Service was very poor.  Carne asada tacos were flavorful    Probably won't come back here.  Too many other good choices close by"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on triple D, I knew I had to add it to my bookmarks for when I visited Phoenix. Unfortunately for me, the food was just A-OK. This place seems to be very popular though as it was completely full with a line of people waiting at 6pm on a Thursday night.  Our server, Claudia, was really great and hooked it up with the chips for us. We are used to the typical free chips and salsa when going to a Mexican restaurant but this place gives bread and salsa.   I'm from Dallas, TX and here we have street tacos and street elotes in a cup for a little over $1 each. We started off with the Esquites which is pretty much like the street elotes we have at home but were pretty shocked a small bowl of it could cost $9. It was good, though. Just not $9 good. I guess I'm used to it being so cheap at home.  We tried the infamous chiles en nogada and were underwhelmed. There was a LOT going on in that dish and maybe it was too complex for our simpleton taste buds? I also could not believe it was a $24 dish...a tad overpriced in my opinion. Not sure what was in there that could make it $24.   I also had to try the acclaimed Cochinita Pibil and got it in taco form. Again, I was underwhelmed...I was excited for it since it is slow roasted over night. The pork was pretty mediocre and the texture wasn't as tender as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I'm in utter disbelief of how bad this place was. With all of the amazing reviews I thought there was no way it could be bad. How on earth do they get such great reviews in AZ? There's so much better Mexican food here, even right down the street from Barrio. I will say the guacamole is great-super fresh but super awkward when your Henry Rollins look alike server is angrily smashing it together next to your table. Apparently he doesn't like that part of his job. Actually, it seemed like he pretty much hated his job, which may have ruined a lot of my experience. We ordered our guac & he asked if we wanted anything besides water-we told him we hadn't looked at the drink menu yet and he slams it back on the table and says \"Guess I'll leave this here then\"....sorry, Henry. I'm also the kind of person that says \"thank you\" throughout my meal...like when you fill my glass, bring my food, take my plate etc. Not once did he say \"you're welcome\". Such a douche. I did read in one other review that the servers treat you like you should be so lucky to be eating there. Definitely felt it. Anyway, got the Conchinita Pibil Tacos. Pork was dry and tortillas were soggy. You get 4 street tacos on corn tortillas and for some reason someone thinks its a good idea to dump salsa on them so they fall apart by the time they get to your table. Pair that with a side of Ore Ida steak fries and you have yourself a $13 dinner? Thank god I didn't spring for a pricier dish since I thought after the guacamole I'd be mostly full anyway. My boyfriend got the seafood Chile Relleno and said it was ok - for 21 bucks it should have been way better than ok - I don't eat seafood much so I didn't try it but I've seen him get more excited over a shrimp burrito from Señor Taco. To end the evening our server took 10 minutes to pick up our payment from our table, and blatantly ignored my boyfriend trying to get his attention. I took my leftovers in a to go box to be polite when the busser asked if I wanted them since I still had half a plate of food, but did not hesitate to throw them directly into the trash when I got home. I don't even normally write reviews, but I was so blown away by the vast difference between the reviews I'd read and my experience that I just had to. The only reason I'd ever return to this place would be for happy hour. Drinks and guacamole, yes. Dinner - never again."}
{"text":"I hate to be the \"odd man out\" here, but this place has done me wrong! I ended up just walking out without getting my food after 35 minutes!

{"text":"I was in town on business and so I did the solo dinner out at Barrio Cafe.  Usually solo dinners go by quickly for me, since I'm usually just hungry, ready to go back to my hotel room after a long day on the road, and most importantly, nobody interesting to chat with over dinner.  I expected to spend 30 minutes there, tops.  Well, the food was so fantastic that I definitely lingered - probably about an hour.  Not exactly a world record for longest dinner, but a long time to be sitting at a table in a restaurant by yourself.  I didn't care since the cuisine was so good.  I started off with their signature guacamole - prepared tableside.  It was excellent and served with a basket of slightly greasy homemade tortilla chips.  The pomegranate seeds in the guac were a nice, unique addition.  I toyed around with several different potential selections for my entree, but at the waitress' recommendation settled on the stuffed pepper.  It was stuffed with chicken, fruits, nuts and a pleasant sauce.  I only wish there had been more of the stuffing.  It was fantastic.  I have to tell you I was thinking about ordering one of their tortas, but after making an offhand comment about good torta bread, the waitress advised me that it was served on a french roll.  The idea of a french roll taking the place of a soft, authentic torta bun turned me off, so I went with the stuffed pepper.  In retrospect, given the quality of the cuisine I ordered, I'm sure the torta would've been good - my preconceived notions of torta bread notwithstanding.  I finished off my meal with the churros.  Two homemade churros filled with creme caramel, drizzled with caramel, candied pecans,vanilla ice cream and raspberries - unbelievable.  The place was small and intimate.  Excellent food and a welcoming vibe, despite obviously being a place not frequently visited by out of towners.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Slipping.  We live in San Diego but get here at least once every two months.  Our last visit May 16 was not up to their standards.  Service was unprofessional with our waiter making stops asset other tables while holding our 'hot' food.  Furthermore they have reduced the portion size of their table side guacamole and our entrees just did not have the snap they used to...we will go back but will stick to their great happy hour and margaritas."}
{"text":"After seeing Barrio Cafe on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives we decided to check it out while we were in Phoenix for the day. We must have arrived right after the lunch rush hour, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. At this time on Saturday afternoon, there was happy hour so my husband went for 2 for 1 beers (Negro Modelo), while I went for the house-made horchata. It comes in a medio litro bottle and I almost finished the entire thing. Very good! For a starter we ordered the Queso Fundido, which had some loganiza chorizo in it which gave it a nice flavor. For our entrees we tried the Cochinita Pibil and Chiles en Nogada. I enjoyed my Chiles en Nogada becuase of the sweet and savory flavors, but it didn't blow me away as I thought it would. My husband's cochinita pibil was tender, but since he knows the secret to making pork like that he was also underwhelmed. While everything tasted good, we had higher expectations and thought that the prices were a bit expensive for what you get. That being said, I would go again to give some other items on the menu a try and see if I still feel the same way about the place."}
{"text":"I'm mainly posting this review to remind myself of the delicious Cochinita Pabil that I enjoyed here a few months ago while on vacation.  The margaritas, guacamole and dessert were solid too, but what I'll walk away remembering is that slow-roasted pork.  Delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best, upscale mexican food places in the city! Inventive and amazing flavors.  Went for lunch today and had the Cochinita pabil (sp?) torta and wife had the carne asada tacos with salad. Portions were generous and the service was good. If you want the same old same old, go to macayos for gringo sonoran food."}
{"text":"That this place is excellent is not news to the hundreds of you that are loyal to this place. Silvana is a force of nature, as you know.   Peg and I made our first trip to this place last week.  As is always the case with places that we love and visit again and again, there needs to be extraordinary everything. In this case, Marcos provided excellent service and the man (sadly, I do not know his name...yet)  who was taking care of busing tables, keeping beverages filled was incredible. In the midst of the whirlwind of activity, he was smiling and very efficient. The guacamole is legendary and will good reason. Pomegranate seeds in the midst of fresh ingredients and perfect avocados are genius.  The pollo poblano was a wonderful starter. The complementary dishes were tacos.....one featuring succulent pulled pork and the other, halibut..and they were simply amazing. When a familiar face is present, it makes the experience even more special. Julio Mata is one of the more accomplished chefs around and his skills elevate the whole playing field. We are delighted to include this place as one of our best ever places to relax and enjoy!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"So I guess if all you have as comparison is other Phoenix restaurants, then this place deserves 3 stars.  However, if you have ever lived in California or traveled in Mexico, this place is over priced and over rated.  Sorry if I offended any fan but you need to try more upscale restaurants outside Arizona."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I do, but every time we are here (because visitors insist on going) the food is mediocre and the servers are so pretentious. This time the fish was dry and the food was cold. There was a loud, obnoxious patron who bothered our party of 6 all night. My aunt asked if they ever ask people to quiet down and the server was rude and blew her off. I support local business and don't ever mind spending money on food but this place is so over rated. I want to love it but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is just what we were looking for in Phoenix. The top and nod and bread or refreshing beginning. Califor at Veracruz is the best I've ever had. Fillet mignon azul was perfect.wish we were in town longer we wait to try one of each thing on the menu. Excellent service, Eclectic decor, right crawl tables and excellent food. We couldn't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent!  Chiles en Nogada was fantastic.  Would go back when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lovely place no wonder it was on the news. Ordered tacos but should of explored more. ..Will return. :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it over for the famous guacamole and it is delicious. Dinner plates was also great, with wonderful fresh ingredients. Seafood Del Mar was recommended and loved it. Waiter shared his readers and phone light for the menu. Jack Daniel sangria also good. Not cheap and no rice and beans, lol."}
{"text":"I was expecting my Sunday lunch at Barrio Café to be one thing but got another. They are recognized by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, for their tableside guacamole.   I was expecting tableside guacamole but they don't offer it during lunch. Which, I'm not sure if they did it would change my opinion. What made it unique (not necessarily good) was the addition of the slightly sweet pop of pomegranates seeds. But still, pomegranate seeds or not, I can't justify paying $10 for any guacamole.  What I liked most about Barrio was the service, the live acoustic guitar, and their Chiles en Nogada. Their Chiles en Nogada dish; roasted poblano pepper; stuffed with perfectly seasoned chicken; onion; garlic; pecans; apples; pears; apricots and pomegranates, finished with a creamy slightly sweet almond sauce - was spot on and truly a great surprise.   Overall, I had a really good meal (expensive for Sunday lunch) that surprised me and intrigues me to try other entrees. Their dishes incorporate seasonal produce with, what seems to be, authentic Mexican cuisine. Hopefully there will be more surprises for me when I go back."}
{"text":"This is a really cute and quaint restaurant. As you drive in to the parking lot all the walls of the parking lot and the building is painted with Mexican forklore. Inside the restaurant they have a bar that offers many different types of tequila and a very knowledgeable bartender. The food was fresh delicious and had the perfect combinations of flavors. The guacamole  is to die for. They add pomegranates into the guacamole which gives it a a little sweetness with the spicy. I had the pork tacos and the park was absolutely wonderful. When I come to Phoenix again, I will definitely have to stop by here."}
{"text":"Holy fuck nuggets, this was some seriously good Mexican food!  OK, look, I'm from New York City, and I will admit I do not know JACK SHIT about good Mexican good. Why? Because we don't fucking have it! It's really frustrating! So when I travel anywhere in taco chucking distance of the Mexican border, I belly straight up and stuff my face with every dish ending in -ito, -dilla, and -o, with some sweet, sweet horchata (very generously portioned at this place) to wash it all down. I think the avocado/pomegranate guacamole made at your table is what sealed the deal for me on Barrio Cafe. I mean, seriously, OMG, the food here was delicious. I can't say there weren't a few false notes, but I can hardly remember what they were, so fuck it. The tequila menu is also ridiculous. I need to come back to work my way through it. I hope they offer ambulance service, because I don't even want to think about what's going to gush out of my body after I OD at this, one of the finest Mexican restaurants I encountered in the sprawling wasteland that is Phoenix."}
{"text":"So I've been waiting to visit this plc since 2014 after seeing it featured 9n triple D. We ordered cochinito pibil and the chiles en hogada as well as a tamando and orchata aguas frescas which come served in glass coca cola bottles (cute and unique touch).   Food was great! Very flavorful and portions fairly generous. The aguas frescas reminded me of what I would get if I was in Mexico.Super Rich. More of a sweet treat after your meal then a beverage though (that's a good thing). Just a suggetion, have plain water with your meal to truely appreciate the array of flavors in each dish. But don't skip on the aguas. Just save it for last   Service was great, the team there truly runs like a well oiled machine. Food came quick and hot and drinks were nice amd cold. Didn't have to ask for anything, high chair  bread basket  plain water  ice cups in case ur too fancy for the coke bottle  the bill   Only thing that was a bit uncomfortable was a lady that might have been management overseeing the not just the staff and front door but also tje guests from afar but never actually greeted customers. Made me feel like I was being watched and timed.   Anyhow, Decor is nice and simple. Place was very clean.   I definitely recommend and would eat here again."}
{"text":"The staff was nice, and the environment artistic and relaxing. The menu is a bit pricey, but its the price to pay for artistic fare. I tried to order the specialty, Chiles en Nogada, but was told that it was seasonal and unavailable, despite being listed on the menu. I then ordered the Granada con Flor de Jamaica. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the hibiscus sauce flavorful and addictive. The spicy mash accompaniment was just ok. The fresh brewed iced tea was wonderful. The olive tapanade with the bread was great as well. My husband had the carne asada tacos, which were ok. For a local, this is a special occasion type of place. I will definitely take out of town visitors to lunch or dinner here.  Not to mention that the local street art is the jam!"}
{"text":"stopped in for dinner on a quick trip through phoenix with high expectations of quality Mexican food.  instead, I got overpriced, overcooked and underseasoned food combined with absent-minded service.  we started with the guacamole \"prepared\" table side.  the server brought out a bowl of pre-chunked avocado while dragging a cart of ingredients behind him.  \"you want everything?\"  sure.  he then slopped spoonfuls of each ingredient into the bowl, gave it a quick toss and laid it on our table.  I did like the pomegranate seeds but the flavors were bland and the avocado chunks were too big.  in a word, service was exceptionally lazy.  for dinner I had chicken mole enchiladas.  the mole was good but the chicken was way overcooked and very dry.  my guess is it was cooked well before dinner service started.  the globs of cheese underneath the enchiladas were not melted and not very appetizing.  I also tried a taste of the pork taco.  the pork was tender but also lacked flavor."}
{"text":"5 words: pomegranate seeds in the guac. Literally the best thing I've ever put in my mouth...followed shortly by the amazing enchiladas suizas. If I could give Barrio 10 stars I would. If you've seen them all over Food Network and other TV networks, there's a reason. Chef Silvana is a wonderfully innovative chef with an amazing method to making everything taste just right. Barrio is pricey but worth every penny. They are closed on Mondays - made that mistake once, nearly broke my heart. This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Agree with a Previous poster. My wife and I used to Love Barrio. Some things have changed, and not for the better! The guacamole dip has lost it's taste and the portion has decreased. The price has increased, however - as has all other items on the Menu. My Pork was dry for the 2nd time in a row, and our Service was simply awful. Margaritas are over 10 bucks, and waitress never came around to ask if we'd care for another. I went to the bar and ordered after tiring of waiting for her. With so many better Mexican Restaurant choices in the Phoenix area, we will not return here. The \"No Reservations\" Policy is a letdown also!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner Wed. night 2.15.17. Did not realize until it was too late that the business would be closing following day, Thursday, for \"DAY WITHOUT IMMIGRANTS.\" The food, service, and attitudes of employees was horrible. $19.00 for cold enchiladas, $12.00 for 3 dried out tacos. What? Am I supposed to take this because they want to make a point? Will never return. They are actually protesting the fact that they have rights being in this country illegally?"}
{"text":"I really really really like this place! They have some one of a kind dishes! It has always been a positive experience any time I have been here. The waitstaff is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Did not like it.  Do not understand its appeal to others.  Table prepared guacamole was boring -- throwing a few pomegranate seeds into it does not make it tasty.   The Yucatan entree Cocinita Pibil was a mess, both visually and taste wise.  Too bad, I love that dish.   No outstanding flavor this time.  Just bad.  In addition, waiter was inattentive.  Had to wait 30 minutes for a table as no reservations are accepted.  Would not go back.  Phoenix, you can do better, can't you?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap tex/mex this is not your place.  More so authentic expensive mexican food.   Loud band plays fri/sat/sun and its hard to have a nice conversation with the rest of your table.  We asked them to turn it down a notch, but they said it wasn't possible."}
{"text":"Well...the guacamole's good.  That's about all the good stuff I can say.  They're definitely pretentious in here.  NOT handicapped accessible.  And, if there's a fire, good luck getting out!!  But if you like to live dangerously, eat meat and drink lots of tequila, this is the place to go to get your Mex on.  If you're not a high roller, head down to Salsita's and get cheaper eats."}
{"text":"Awesome!!  Great food! Great vibe! Great service! I highly recommend happy hour for $1.50 mini tacos.  They were all great, especially the shrimp and halibut."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I had the worst service I have ever had in my life at the Barrio! Our server was SO rude! I went here with a friend of mine and we were completely blown away by our experience. This was my first time dining at Barrio Cafe and my very last! We ordered the table side guacamole, and it wasn't \"table side,\" our server made it in back and just threw it down on the table. I ordered the fish taco's and my friend ordered the quesadilla . My fish tacos tasted like I was eating fish sticks wrapped in a stale tortilla. SO GROSS. My friends Quesadilla  was so bland, how do you mess up a quesadilla????  So to say the least Barrio Cafe is forever marked off my places to dine at in the city."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Table side guacamole is a must. All around just great Mexican cuisine in the heart of the city. We ordered the pescado tacos and the pollo poblano and both were delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been recommended to barrio cafe by a coworker in the culinary field, he told me it was really good authentic mexican food, and I was really excited and looking forward to try it since I am mexican and have experienced food from mexico city.  The place is very nicely decorated, the bar has a big variety of tequilas and the music is spot on. The appetizer had a very nice taste , not too salty, just right for a tapenade. We ordered the famous guacamole, which was also different from what you normally see, but to my taste it had too much lime juice, which made it a bit sour.  I ordered the horchata and it came in a coca cola bottle, which was unique and very good! i also decided to try enchiladas suizas, my husband had the pozole and my mother the chile en nogada The enchiladas to my taste were not that great, dry and the chicken came in huge chunks and also very dry. Un seasoned vegetables and no hint of tomatillo.  The chile en nogada was the best of the three, nice flavor and good presentation.  My husband honestly did not like the pozole, he thought it was salty, and he found pomegranate in it, which was too much.  The best thing of our meal was the service, excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This place often is listed as one of the best most authentic Mexican restaurants in the country. I totally agree with this. Chef has certainly learned the old ways passed down from generations and her food sends this message. It's perfection. Excellent happy hour deals as well."}
{"text":"Have been going to Barrio Cafe for years Live in North Scottsdale but the Concinita Pibil is so worth the drive to downtown Phoenix! Wait staff is extremely friendly, and the table side guacamole is something special. You get a very unique vibe from the time you walk in to the restaurant from the back door. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Heartbreaking experience. Having dined at two other restaurants under same leadership, our expectations were high. The quality of the food and service was not good, prices very high and the dining room was not clean. We had planned to bring guests here next week and definitely will change that plan. The only positive was the Mexican wine we chose - was quite good."}
{"text":"I stopped into Barrio on my recent trip to Phoenix after reading numerous raving reviews from \"Best Mexican in the US\" lists. I chose the skinny margarita, which I loved and decided to have two. Since it was my first, and perhaps only time, I chose the pork in banana leaf for my entree, or the Cochinita Pibil. The pork is marinated in achiote and sour orange, and then slow roasted in a banana leaf. The meal can be shared, and it is served with fresh warm corn tortillas that were the perfect accompaniment, along with some Mexican zucchini squash.  There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, so I definitely would love to return soon. If you're looking for Mexican cooking that is creative and not just the traditional offerings, this is the place for gourmet in a reasonable casual atmosphere with very warm service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to fall in love with this place but unfortunately it did not impress me as I expected.  Yeah the parking is bad and the store front is somewhat hidden in a sketchy part of Phoenix (all quirks of great spots) but I felt like there was something missing.  I was all excited to try some new dishes and have a cool unique dining experience.  The interior is very reminiscent of a quaint mom and pop restaurant.  The idea of the guac made at your table side is great and it did taste pretty good but it was certainly not worth the price.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and there was so much sauce on it that it was getting all over the place (namely my face)!  The dish did taste good but I am not a fan of corn tortillas (and that's all they have here).   I did finish my meal but later on had the worst stomach pains (probably due to the assortment of flavors in the guac, the house salad and my shrimp tacos).        Maybe I should give it another shot?  Possibly I should have ordered the fish tacos?  All I can think about now is that the shrimp tacos remind me of the shrimp quesadilla at Gecko Grill In Gilbert (and it's half the price and never made me sick)."}
{"text":"My Favorite restaurant for Mexican cuisine in the state. Very inventive and flavorful...there's a reason it is always crowded during prime times. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The guacamole was made fresh at the table and was the best I have ever had. I had the Pollo Poblano entree and that was also fantastic. My wife had chicken enchiladas that were also awesome. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pricy but oh so worth it! Their Polsole (soup) is the best that I have EVER had! Get there early as it packs up! The roasted corn appetizer is also a must!"}
{"text":"The good: food is excellent; the guacamole is made \"live\" at your table with pomegranate seeds for that burst of sweetness.. deliriously good. Fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients and expertly crafted sauces. Chef Silvana is a goddess and knows her way around a kitchen. Also have to mention their truly top shelf from-scratch margaritas (they do them right).   The bad: too small, too crowded, no reservations, and the live music in that tiny space, which would be very enjoyable anywhere else, makes it impossible to talk to your date. Also parking is sketchy... much like the neighborhood.  Would I still go back? Of course. Can't get enough of Silvana's cooking, but it's literally an \"I will tolerate this annoyingly inadequate space for this delectable food\" situation."}
{"text":"Maybe I was there at the wrong time and ordered the wrong thing.  I have heard people RAVE about this joint.  Anyhoo, went in for lunch around 1 on a Wed.  We literally waited about 5 min to be greeted by the server and another 15-20 to get our drinks, which had to be brewed. Given it was good coffee and tea, but 20 minutes to get a drink on the table is silly.  You have to ask for water, as they dont serve it automatically, and the bread and tapanade came well before the drinks.  The tapanade and bread was pretty damn good. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, and they were very fresh tasting, but rather flavorless otherwise.  It came with a nice salad with cranberries, which was pretty good. The food was good, but not great.  The freshness factor was the most distinguishable flavor.  It would have been amazing if it were fresh and tasty. The server was just fine, and it was mod-high-mod for lunch price wise."}
{"text":"I went here off the recommendation of a former teacher of mine. I love finding these local secrets. We went on a Tuesday night, and it was packed. You know a restaurant is good if it is packed on a Tuesday.  We were lucky to get seated right away. We had the whole family there including the baby. I thought they seemed a little put off by the baby, so that didn't make me feel too good. Its ok though because my baby surprises everyone by how much so loves going out to eat. She is a foodie in the making and tries everything.  Anyways, we ordered margaritas to start with. They were very tasty and strong but quite expensive. In fact all the drinks were too expensive. My \"house\" margarita was 10 dollars.   Our service was a little iffy and our waiter kept disappearing and would not check back on us. This is why I didn't give them 4 stars. I felt the service was poor. We had to wait a long time to try and place our orders. We asked for more bread and he seemed irritated by it, and it took a while to get it. I guess I just did not feel the love. it took a long time to get the check at the end. No bueno.   The food was really really good though. I loved the guacamole. I want all my guac to have pomegranate seeds in it now. I also liked my cheese and mushroom enchiladas. They were delicious. I thought it was weird that they didnt have rice and beans and wanted to serve steak fries. That is fine if you want to be different, but the steak fries were soggy and not very good. I would have expected them to be better if they are wanting to be different.  I think this place would have been 4-5 stars, but the service brought it down."}
{"text":"I've been living in downtown Phoenix for about 5 months now. I drive past Barrio Cafe on almost a daily basis. It's constantly packed it seems and I've heard nothing but good things about it. Finally, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for dinner. I have to say, I am a little disappointed. Maybe my hopes were too high, but our meals weren't as great as I thought they'd be, especially for the price. My boyfriend had the carne asada tacos - they were the blandest tacos I've ever tasted. Filibertos has better tacos. I had the duck salad. That actually was fairly good, but there was a little too much duck fat for my taste. The menu also listed grilled tomatoes in my salad, but there literally was ONE tomato! Very odd.  The thing I enjoyed the most though was the artwork by Lalo. A truly talented artist. I enjoyed checking out his artwork while eating. The decor is really cool too, although a bit crammed inside.  I had Chino Bandidos for lunch that same day and honestly, it was far more enjoyable than Barrio Cafe - and much cheaper! I'd rather go there any day over this place. It was good, but nothing like what I thought it'd be. Won't be going back I don't think."}
{"text":"Always great, delicious food. Margaritas are very good. The Don Julio Lowrider is my favorite. Chicken enchiladas are outstanding.  Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"I have vacationed in the Phoenix area for the last six years. I never miss dining here each time I visit. the food is very good.

{"text":"Overpriced. The food isn't that good. I ordered the carne asada tacos which comes with 3 for $14. Just to top things off they were cold."}
{"text":"First time here.  I have seen it featured on TV with Guy on Diners, Drive-Ins a and Dives.  Atmosphere is unique in a good way that pleasantly surprised me.  Bread and Olive spread is tasty.  Made from Spanish olives.  Roasted corn soup  is the best I have ever had!!!  I order their highly acclaimed pork in banana leaf entree.  OMG, so moist and tasty.  Unfortunately, on the salty side, especially after the Olive spread.  I couldn't finish it because of that.  (I still took it home!)  Pork is partnered with mashed potatoes, fresh cooked veggies and tortillas.  Portions are large and can be shared by two.  I will return and get the corn soup but will try a new entry ."}
{"text":"No. We've been there before and the food and service were excellent, BUT we think it's had its season of fame and now, it is over.  The service was terrible. Rushed when it wasn't busy, 20 minute wait for cocktails, no follow up on the food, the \"famous pork\" was essentially boiled, flavorless, dry, without any sauce, pico, cream, zip, none, nada. Server was chewing bubble gum and proud of his bubbles. Once we were served, that was the end. Never came back. We had to go get the check at the front and just left.  Never again. Rethink this one. Zero stars."}
{"text":"As you head south on 16th street toward Thomas Rd. it's easy to lose the Barrio Cafe amongst the nail salons, hair salons, and bail bonds (hey, it's a package deal folks!)   Smallish restaurant with tight seating. I can see why people have complained it gets loud. Luckily my co-workers and I were just about the loudest ones there...so my apologies if you were at Barrio today!   I ordered shrimp tacos. I order shrimp tacos everywhere now. I don't know what is going on. Is this a pregnancy craving? I could hop right across the street where they offer free pregnancy tests... just in case.   Anyhoo, the shrimp tacos were the bomb.com. I think the gallo blanco shrimp tacos and these could probably have a Lucha libre-style fight and it would truly be neck-and-neck.   They make their house margy with agave nectar (keepin' it the same plant family) which is a tasty twist. I like agave nectar in my coffee instead of honey...which I used to use instead of sugar. It's the neo-hippie coming out of me.   Overall, decent food, a little pricey ($15 for 4 shrimp tacos) - good serving but at $3 a pop Gallo Blanco might still be the winner. I'd like to come back for brunch - mimosas and chile relleno sounds like a perf Sunday activity. I'd most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, upscale restaurant, great service! The outside is covered in murals and the inside boasts vibrant art. It's pricey ($23 for enchiladas) and worth it. The enchiladas suizas were delish with subtle flavors, a creamy sauce, and fresh red onion. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"It's definitely a little hole in the wall. But no diamond in the rough. Food is tasty but not worth the price. I would go to a newer location because this one is small and cramped and warm."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not, took ten minutes to get a couple of waters and it was not a busy time, they never came back to ask if we wanted something else, suddenly they started picking up our plates not even asking if we were done, needed a box, wanted dessert, and brought the check. They are doing everything so fast around that they forgot their manners. It felt like they needed the table and no one was waiting for one! Unfortunate because the place is nice, food is good."}
{"text":"Not located in the best part of Phoenix (I always cross my fingers that my car will be there when I leave), but great food and drinks.  Definitely my fav mexican spot.  Haven't been there lately, so I'll have to go soon and come back to update my review with more specifics."}
{"text":"I'm sorry amigo... but olives and bread as a starter instead of chips and salsa. Really??? Let me begin this review from the very start:  We heard amazing reviews about this place so we decided to stop by and have some lunch. The place was packed full of güeros enjoying their food. We took a seat and as our palates were salivating for some chips and savory salsa, a basket of bread was set down in front of us, and for a spread we were given an olive tapenade. I guess you could say it was one of the best olive tapenade I've ever been served in a Mexican restaurant... it was certainly the first. Besides that the overall place was incredibly authentic, the one Mexican busboy and hostess really added to the diverse atmosphere of the restaurant. My daughter and I ordered fish tacos, we had the option of choosing a salad or fries as a side. I chose the salad and my daughter the fries. When I received the salad my jaw dropped in shock... a bowl with spinach and arugula, dried cranberries, and crumbled cheese, all next to a heaping serving of pico de gallo. The salad was additionally topped with a vinaigrette. That, combined with the poorly made pico de gallo resulted in none of the flavors complimented eachother and overall leaving an unpleasant flavor in my mouth. Gulping down coffee to cleanse my palate I was ready for my fish tacos. The tacos were good, but nothing outstanding or as delicious as people described in their reviews. The tacos were Similar to the salad, they were drenched in even more pico de gallo. In conclusion the best thing about our lunch at Barrios was my daughters fries. It had just the right amount of paprika, and salt, the crispness was on point! If there's one thing this Mexican restaurant knows to do it's make some pretty darn tasty fries."}
{"text":"Met up a few friend here for brunch, this place in chill, nice and up beat. Art work inside of ten restaurant and on the walls outside were great. I ordered From their brunch menu Huevos con chorizo, and ordered Home made lemonade. I loved everything and food tasted wonderful. The staff was be ray friendly and up beat as well.  2 minor issues I had with this place ere the following:  - food portion for brunch was small, compared to other places around town. - initially I wanted an Arnold palmer and I was told that I'll be charged twice for that since the lemonade is home made lemonade, and they mix it with iced tea. Didn't make sense to me so I went with just the lemonade, which was great.   Would definitely come back. Good food for sure."}
{"text":"Omg. What a fantastic place!!!! The roasted almond sauce is out of this world. Not much more to say."}
{"text":"After such a great first experience, I returned to a lesser experience.  I certainly didn't care for my dry and flavorless chicken enchilada's.  Also, I had vowed to return to finally try the much discussed table side guacamole-also, a disappointment.  It needed salt and more kick.  The consistency was not great, I don't think it was mixed very well....which I know because I watched it happen.  In a cruel twist of fate, this restaurant also serves one of the most mouthwatering desserts I have ever had.  I still dream about the warm fried cinnamon sugar churros with ice cold vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce drizzled all over the plate.  I vow to make hose happen in my own kitchen...please god, make it happen!"}
{"text":"OMG their mushroom burritos are the absolute best. I have to request it as they took it off their menu. They will still prepare it if asked. The guacamole is fantastic. The ambiance is very cool. The wait time to get in can be long but worth it."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. I wish I would have gotten some Mexican food with my cheese. Everything was COVERED. In fact, that majority of the dishes were just cheese. I have never seen anything like it. In addition, they were out of potato for the evening (at 8 o'clock) and everything came out luke warm. However, the salad was good... but I don't consider that Mexican. But hey! ...to each their own."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and this is the closest restaurant from our new house. We drive by almost everyday and every time we saw this restaurant in the evening, it's packed with lots of people, no matter it's a weekday or weekend. We assumed this is a good place to eat so decided to give a try.  Well....I know we had a kind of high expectation about this restaurant but still, I only can give them 3 stars top.   Their service is good enough. I think their food is just average and over priced. The pork was dry and  way too salty and not tender at all. I felt a bit odd to have french fries with tacos and again, they were so salty. The shrimp tacos tasted okay but too much liquid inside, which I guess is water from shrimps, not from sauce.   If I ate lots of fast food Mexican food for a while, I would appreciate their food. I think they make effort to make their food \"look\" good or \"sound\" good but it's missing the x-factor to me and it's just average. There are other Mexican restaurants with better and/or more reasonably priced food.   Conclusion, I do not recommend this place and we would not go there again although this is the closest restaurant from our house. I don't say this restaurant is bad but it's not good either, just as 3 stars explain, \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"We love the downtown location and only recently got to check out the version at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  Same good food but at the airport (just before you leave town) is a good thing! Better than any airport food I've had outside of microbreweries in the Portland airport, good margaritas, and fantastic guacamole. If you are on a lay over in terminal 4 at Sky Harbor without a chance to check out Phoenix, at least get lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"This place is ok (decent food, slow service, etc). I thought it would compare favorably with upscale Mexican restaurants, but I found myself preferring Rolberto's."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service. It's somewhat on the pricey side but went in expecting that. The churros are to die for, probably the best part of my visit :)"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food.  Eat here for an upscale Mexican fix.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is here is the best.  I have only been here once, but I plan to return.  I was there on a Saturday night.  There was Cuban Music and the service was superb.  The appetizers are fresh and unique."}
{"text":"Tiny tacos for taco tuesday. I get it, you can't make huge tacos when they're discounted...but c'mon, quarter size??"}
{"text":"Very fun and eclectic Latin influence.  The Guacamole is good, but not worth $12.  I really swayed between 3 and 4 stars, but the atmosphere and ambiance pushed me towards a higher score.  Great tacos, amazing marinated pork.  We'll be back for sure to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant!! Everything is freshly made--the waitress made the guacamole right in front of us. Chips were hot and homemade. They have some very unique dishes, but also a lot of traditional Mexican dishes.   I got a dish with chicken, a bunch of fruit, and an almond cream sauce baked inside of a poblano pepper. I wouldn't think to put those ingredients together, but it was such a delicious meal! My sister got tacos and said that they were fantastic as well.   Also, make sure you try their homemade horchata!   100% would go back again. I love the cozy vibes, delicious food, and beautiful art outside of the cafe!"}
{"text":"First impression of this place is hard to over come but I felt it was really over priced for Mexican cuisine.  Maybe I didn't indulge in too much of the menu where some would say I should have ventured to and would have had a better meal, but I kept it simple and went with my norm for trying out a new mexican restaurant.   We started off with the critically acclaimed guacamole that stated is \"prepared at your table\" and costs over 11$.  It was good and was composed of the basic recipe, avocados, tomato, onion etc. but had a sweetness of pomegranate  to it that I wasn't a huge fan of.  It certainly wasn't worth 11$, which is the highest I ever had to pay for guacamole and it certainly wasn't prepared at my table as it stated.     I had a few different varieties of the tacos which were actually good, better than most street tacos I've had in the past especially the Carne Asada.  The conchinita pibil definitely made a great taco, but I'm sure the dinner plate would have been a better choice to get the full flavor of the pork.  Over all it was good but like I said it a bit over priced for 3 tacos and fries.    I enjoyed the atmosphere and I'm sure if I went back and tried a few of their drinks and their seafood menu id have a better idea of what this place has to offer.  Over all it was a good, I plan on going back and trying more of the menu but i would probably pass on the guacamole."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to get seated which wasn't really bad as it is small and it was Saturday night. Our drinks were dropped on the floor and then a tray full of dishes was dropped behind us not more than five minutes later. We had to yell to each other to talk as their band was so loud. Food was adequate but nothing I would recommend."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I went to Barrio Cafe, years ago. I loved it. The guac seemed like a revelation, the margaritas had me at \"tequila\" and the service staff seemed happy to be working in such a cool funky place.   My, how times have changed. Its been a while since I was there..and I guess the shine has worn off.   Like other Yelpers..I was less than impressed with the service. But our visit was on a Sunday and I figured, with a smaller crowd, the service would be better. Our server, alas, was epically..\"meh\". I don't think he ever said \"hello\" he said \"what will you be ordering?\", we simply asked for what we wanted, he shrugged and got it. I guess in its most elemental form, that is service. But it isn't ALL bad news.  I watched longingly as other diners had a server who practically glowed. He engaged, he laughed, he made recommendations..oh, and he is multi-talented as it was his artwork on display throughout the restaurant.  Bar service during our wait was no better - in fact, that guy seemed down right irritated that he had to take drink orders. We got our drinks, but only after he got the order wrong the first time (for two drinks?!).  For good food, I can put up with a lot. But know what? The food didn't hit any home runs either. I had a pablano chilie stuffed with shrimp (unpeeled for god's sake!) and scallops. The scallops were mushy and small and unpeeled shrimp is simply unforgivable at this price and the cheese was just a reheated mess. I ate it, but it wasn't worth raving over. We had the guac-and it was \"good\", but I just wasn't wowed anymore. I DID appreciate that they still make their own chips - that's cool, but not enough to warrant a \"weeeeee-oooooooh!\"  I totally wish it had rocked. I really do. I get to PHX about 6X a year and I am ALWAYS craving good food like what they are SUPPOSED to serve at Barrio Cafe. Its funny, because later in the week I ate at La Parilla Suiza, and it was just so much more satisfying. I'll write a separate review, suffice to say, it doesn't get the press that Barrio gets and that's too bad.  Maybe its a case of expectations-expect too much and you are sure to be disappointed. I was.   Here's my one hint for those who still want to eat there. Sunday nights, 7PM, almost no wait. Service probably won't be any better, but at least you won't have to stand in small, cramped space to wait for your disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"Great Food and unique atmosphere.  Gourmet twists on Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I figured this place must have been good, since I'm an out-of-towner and it was recommended to me everytime I told someone I was going to Phoenix. I was impressed, overall.  We waited over an hour and there was little space available, but being able to buy margaritas at the bar made it all more tolerable. The drink menu is excellent and fairly priced.  The guacamole, which is made at the table, is incredible.  I've never had guac with pomegranate seeds, but it was a perfect mix, as it added a bit of sweetness.  My only recommendation is to not have the cheese added.  It adds a weird flavor and consistency, but not enough to ruin the guacamole, just a little strange. I had the Enchiladas de Hongos, which were quite tasty, however the sauce was sooooo thick and heavy that it somewhat overshadowed the food it covered.  Again, not enough to make it inedible, but just overpowering and detracted a bit from enjoying the rest of the flavors of the dish. Didn't get a chance to get dessert, but maybe next time.  I would definitely give this another try."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The decoration of the place is quite claim and the restroom interior is scary lol."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 star reviews because I believe they should be reserved for ONLY the best food combined with great ambiance.  This place does it all- and that is high praise after living and eating well in NYC for 2 years.    The first time we tried eating here we walked away because the wait was 90 minutes minimum (Friday night at 6:30 PM).  We wised up and decided to try again arriving Saturday at 5:30.  We had a party of 4- and we were seated without a wait.  The waiter proved to be exceptional - offering descriptions of the entrees that made our mouths water.  We had the guacamole- made table side which was excellent. I have never tried it with pomegranite seeds before and it was a nice twist!   For my main I had the slow roasted pork- Conchita Pibil, which was excellent.  The flavors in the mashed potatoes and grilled zuchini were also stellar.   Someone in our party tried the chiles en Nogada (which is a seasonal dish) and it was excellent also.  We skipped dessert because we were so full- next time I will save room.   I will certainly come back here and highly recommend it to anyone who wants good authentic cuisine in a \"funky\" different atmosphere.  Warning: it can get VERY loud around the bar area- especially on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Churros = GOOD; Mysteriously delicious restaurant you could easily overlook = typically Phoenix in a way you can come to appreciate via the treasure hunt hypothesis.    The food is artfully prepared and tasty, but modern Mexican just doesn't sit well with me -- it is far too pretentious.  And my $12 margarita was just not worth it -- which was a bummer  (oh...is it past 1995?  Have people stopped saying that?) because I was in a celebratory mood."}
{"text":"My husband heard about this restaurant and had been dying to try it, and I was anxious to try some local flavor. It is a smaller restaurant, which adds to the ambiance. There was a ton of beautiful local artwork on the walls, along with a boatload of writeups and rave reviews. I knew we were in a great place. The menu had all kinds of great items, which made it hard to choose an entree. I picked the shrimp tacos with spicy fries and he had the Pescado Veracruz. We also had the guacamole made fresh table-side. Everything was delicious, expertly seasoned and full of flavor. We didn't get to try any margarita's this go round, but plan to try those on the next visit."}
{"text":"The Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican joints in town. If you are looking for traditional Mexican you might be disappointed with Barrio because Barrion Cafe serves what i like to call neuvo Mexican. I can't really explain what i mean by that...LOL...all I can tell you is that the food is FANTASTIC. My favorites are the Enchiladas del Mar and the Lobster Quesadillas....YUM. Oh did I mention the table side guacamole? Yeah it's the BOMB. So if you want one of the best Mexican meals in town with a twist then Barrio is where it's at."}
{"text":"Cool little spot downtown. The parking is in the back of the building. The entire back of the building and walls surrounding are painted by artists and are very cool. You enter thru a little door as though being transported to Chicago at a little speakeasy. The tequila list all though great seems to have some hole as far as what's in stock or not. Being a serious tequila lover I was bummed that my first four picks weren't available. Got the table side gauc which was alright but I recommend getting it without the pomegranate seeds. The fish was just middle of the road alright but the traditional enchilada with the addition of churizo was killer!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! From the margaritas to the guacamole to the live entertainment. It's too bad I live in another state but if I'm ever around the neighborhood I will make sure to eat atleast once at barrio cafe."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Barrio Cafe did not disappoint!  All flavors and dishes were delicious.  The quest fondido was different than the norm but so good! The food here is legit!"}
{"text":"Delicious food,  great service, fun environment!! The waiters suggestion was on point and the live music was a great atmosphere enhancer."}
{"text":"This is Mexican food like you've probably never had it before.  None of that chain-restaurant scrap here.  Chef Silvana is top freakin notch.  They don't call it Comida Chingona for giggles.  It is a bit pricey but well worth it in my book. Have the tableside guacamole.  The put pomegranate seeds in it when they're in season.  Margaritas are en-pointe without any icky sweet and sour in them.  You may have to wait, but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"My first time vision Phoenix and our friend took us to Barrio Cafe, great experience! I do not like guacamole and I must say, I LOVED the guacamole! The pomegranate was a game changer! I ate the pork entree and it was delicious! My favorite part was the spicy mashed potatoes though! The service was also really good - our waiter answered all of our questions and was very helpful! I'd return to try out more entrees!"}
{"text":"So this was a weird experience. I'm a dessert person. When I was looking at the menu online there was a picture of a Churro - it looked delicious, sold. In addition I wanted to support a business that participated in the immigrant protest. My son took me there for my birthday! The tequila bar was good, the food was delicious. Here's the part that gets tricky. After seeing the desserts on the menu, I knew before I had selected my entrée that I wanted the Tres Leche Cake. So after dinner I told our waitress that I would like to try it. She asked me if I had ever had it there before. I replied no, first time in restaurant. She went on to explain that it was dry, not the usual Tres Leche Cake, very  bad and in the same breath handed me the check. Wow! Nothing was offered on the dessert menu instead of the foul Tres Leche she described. Did I mention it was my birthday? I don't even remember details about my food, just the dessert part. I left with a bad taste in my mouth for this place. Did I mention it was my birthday and I absolutely love dessert.  I have shared this story with others who were also speechless and shocked!"}
{"text":"Food was great. But having to fork over $20 for a lunch, I thought the portions could have been bigger. Nice decor on the inside. Its a place I would return to, but not more than once a month"}
{"text":"This is not your average tex-mex place. There are authentic mexican dishes served here that you dont find much in the valley. The freshness and the quality are great. It is a bit pricey though, so not your average lunch place, maybe for special occasions. Like: Quality, Taste, Variety Dislike: Neighborhood, Parking (or lack of)"}
{"text":"With 2 years residing in the Phoenix Area, one thing you can't miss, is the extraordinary number of \"Mexican\", \"Tex-Mex\" and/or  \"Southwestern\" offerings there are - many not worth the trouble visiting!  But, if you continue being adventurous, looking for that great place you can come back to, time after time - and have flavor and value, service and attention, cleanliness and attention to detail not to mention terrific ambience... El Barrio is it!  First off, if you've never had a table side serving of stand by your table guacamole-making you'll be so impressed, no other restaurant will ever do better for you!  And that's not just about the art, but the taste - Wow!  Plus, they use Pomegranits - another Wow!  So far over the many visits we've tried many of their beverages, alcoholic or not, and we've never been dismayed, so I won't get into their details, but the food is a different story!  Everything from their ice-cold beers, pozole verde, the Oaxaca pateles, just to mention a few dishes are fantastic.  By the way, don't leave without getting their 'Comida Chingona' T-shirt (a riot).  Enjoy, we continue to do so!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Being from Texas I thought I had had the best mexican food but I was mistaken!  This place knows how to prepare Mexican food that is delicious!  We started with the table side prepared Guacamole & the Queso Fundido!  OMG!  Delish!  Especially the Queso (my only criticism is there was just two mushrooms in the whole batch.  They were yummy so I would ask for more, otherwise, very tasty and really satisfying as far as gooey, cheesy, yumminess.  The chips are the real deal too, light, & crunchy.  We decided to split the Halibut Del Mar w/ shrimp, baby scallops, crab, that came with a side of mash w/ chorizo chips & poblano sauce  - VERY GOOD!  Love the art & the murals outside.  Such a cool place!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference. Wanted great, authentic Mexican. The drinks were very tasty. We had table side quac made and she insisted that we get the pomegranate seeds in it. That was surprisingly tasty even though I thought overall the avocado was very chunky. I like a nice blend of chunky and smooth. My chicken enchiladas were tasty but not the saucy goodness I was hoping for. There was a thick layer of cheese baked on top and no beans and rice to pull it all together. They also brought me veggie enchiladas at first and half way thru I realized there would never be meat. Lol had to send back. The server fixed it right away."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour Friday, after looking at the menu, I don't know that I could justify going any other time. I mean I will go back and have dinner once, and then decide then, but this place is pretty pricey. Happy hour is $1.50 tacos and half price drinks. The tacos are little street tacos and are so perfect. They have duck, carne asada, chorizo and avocado, shrimp, halibut, shredded pork, poblano hash, but with a more fancy name. I think they all pretty much had an avocado slice, and the sauce that comes on the shrimp one is not the same as the one on the halibut. It comes with only one corn tortilla per taco which I love cause I usually either split it into two tacos anyway or throw one out . The hot sauce salsa stuff that comes on the platter was pretty good too. Of course there is a little lime wedge for each too. We started with 4 of the flavors, 2 each, and because they were so good, we tried 2 more flavors, soo the only one I haven't tried was the carne asada, but it has to be good.   Now the drinks, holy moly they are StiFF. Started off with the \"Sangria\" which had the description of Red Wine, Mango Puree, and Jack Daniels. Ok, at Jack Daniels is where I should have said no way you will like it, get something else. My intuition was correct again, and it was terrible, it was Jack Daniels on the front and back end. Thankfully my boyfriend took it down. He started with the LowRider Margarita, which was perfect. Didn't taste any sweet and sour! I then moved on to the Jamaica Margarita which was patron, grand mariner, hibiscus flower, it was pretty good, but super strong. The BF then had a Pink Cadillac, which wasn't that good, but I could probably see people liking it's strangeness. Definitely not for the premixed bottle margarita drinkers.   If this place was simply a taco stand, I'd given it 5 stars. I will definitely update when I can get back and try their dinner, cause it all sounded fantastic."}
{"text":"After years of having this as a bookmark, I was  disappointed and broke afterwards. :( My hubs and I went to the Barrio Cafe on our date night and found that we should have stuck to Popo's on 67th Ave and Indian School.  The place was packed which I thought was a good sign. And let me warn you now, there is limited parking and seating so expect a wait time. Our wait time was 45 min which I'll wait happily if the food is good. I ordered a drink from the small little bar inside. The drink selection was great! They had lots of weird concoctions with horchata and tequila creme which was exciting! I had a drink that mixed horchata with tequila creme and Chambord. It was DELICIOUS and highly recommended ($10.00).   Once we were seated, we were not quickly greeted by our server. The bus boy brought us a bread basket with a tapenade salsa thing dip which I did not like. Our waitress finally came over and greeted us hurriedly as she seemed very busy. We ordered our drinks which we got at a decent time but our server did not come back for another long period. We finally got her attention and she seemed annoyed at us while she was taking our order. I ordered the famous Chiles en Nogadas but I asked to substitute the filling with cheese. The waitress told me that they cannot do substitutions on the dish because it is already premade. Ummmm, WHAT? I waited 45 minutes and traveled all the way from Goodyear, AZ to eat premade food!? I should have left then and there but I didn't because I really wanted to try the food. So I went with the cheese enchiladas and hubs went with the carne asada tacos.   We received our food in a timely manner and the presentation was spot on! But the flavors were not there. My cheese enchiladas ($19.00) tasted like something I warmed up in the microwave. The red sauce tasted canned and the tortillas were hard. My husband said he liked his tacos but it was nothing spectacular or worth the $13.00 price tag (for 3 tacos btw). The only thing I enjoyed from the restaurant was the ambience, the spectacular hortchata, and the live music. Everything else was overpriced and mediocre. I would come back only for drinks next time. Can't go wrong with booze!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes given the reviews.  We expected a nice dinner, but young people from a travel blog appeared suddenly and catering to them was a much higher priority than patrons for the restaurant staff.  Rather than seating them or us somewhere else, we had to endure endless sound checks and mindless PR drivel.  Food is good, not your usual Mexican/American fare, but pricey.  If they are hosting the Wichita Falls Travel Blog when you arrive, have a margarita and the guacamole, then go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"I love the Sunday brunch here.  Awesome, real, authentic Mexican food.  I love the live music on Sundays.  la guitarra es muy fabuloso!!!   It's a long drive for me to get here, but definitely worth it.  Excellent service. Excellent food.  Excellent atmosphere.  I love it!!"}
{"text":"Really good food but the prices are steeeep for what you get.  $12 for guac?  Again, it's good but pricey.  The sides on the meals were actually my favorite part and I'm confident I can eat a 5-gallon bucket full of those mashed potatoes they serve.  My god those are good.  One of our meals was $25 and we thought, \"this is great at $15, good at $20, and completely mediocre at $25).\"  This is a great place to bring people from out of town if you're looking for a nice Mexican meal but there's a lot of good Mexican in the Valley at much more reasonable prices for the day-to-day dining."}
{"text":"Just the most delicious food'. Charming bartender who went out of his way to make me welcome to eat at his bar.  This chef gets a lot of attention in Phoenix. It is well deserved"}
{"text":"Our new favorite phoenix area restaurant! Great food! Excellent service!  Love it and miss it terribly!"}
{"text":"Went to Barrio Cafe while in town for the weekend. Had this recommended by a friend and I've been wanting to go for months. Worth the hype! Sometimes I feel like \"fancy\" Mexican is just regular Mexican food but more expensive. The chef here, however, has compiled a playful menu of regional Mexican dishes and way more than an upgraded Tex Mex.   I opted for the Chiles en Nogada, which I was super pleased by. The pepper had just enough kick and was balanced well with the creamy sauce. All the flavors inside worked well together and made every bite taste unique. The side was okay. The mashed potatoes were flavorful (lots of garlic) but the squash was a bit mushy. Didn't ruin the dish but didn't add a ton. The pepper was enough to carry the meal, although I appreciated a thoughtful departure from just beans and rice. Another person got the Yucatán style pork and it was also delicious.   We weren't really hungry but the churros looked so delicious! We got them and I was glad we did. Super tasty. Do wait for a second because the filling was super hot."}
{"text":"We've visited Barrio Café twice now. Both times, I've found the food to be okay, but not quite what I'd expect given the price you pay.  The place itself has a very hip ambiance, which I'm sure skews the opinion of many local food snobs. What's kind of bizarre is that they are obviously going for a \"dive\" type feel, despite their prices not really reflecting this. There's plenty of art on the wall for sale, presumably done by Phoenix artists.  Getting a basket of bread instead of the usual chips and salsa is a refreshing approach. I really like the horchatas that are served in Mexican coke bottles. It's a unique flair, if nothing else. Don't expect it to \"wow\" you on the same level as nearby La Santisima's signature horchata, however.  I wanted to try a variety of their tacos, but since they refuse to accommodate any mix and match requests, I was stuck with three carne asadas. They were good, but not really any better (or worse) than what you can get at many other establishments for less. The \"spicy\" fries are actually standard fries with spicy ketchup. Whatever.  My girlfriend's enchiladas suiza felt like they were desperately in need of something to liven them up aside from what was on them. I thought they were pretty boring, despite a pretty elaborate menu description.  We've sampled two desserts on two separate visits. The churros with a scoop of ice cream are good, but the price borders on arrogance. The last time I checked, churros are pretty damned cheap!  But us white people love our overpriced foods, so what do you expect?  The Pastel de Chocolate, gives you a bit more bang for your buck and is quite good.  If I come back, I'd probably stop messing around with \"safe\" foods and just get the Chiles en Nogada, since it seems to be the most popular item on the menu. I also intend to sell some of my finger paintings on Barrio's walls if they'll let me. I already picked the space!  In my opinion, it's worth trying, but I don't feel it's a place that's fit for everyone."}
{"text":"Go here if you're interests lie in amazing interpretations on traditional and rustic Mexican cuisine.  Don't go here if your idea of terrific Mexican food is the lunch menu at one of the many \"Gringo\" Mexican restaurants that dot the Valley's culinary landscape.  Halibut Veracruz tonight. Amazing!  Had the Organica margarita, pretty tasty too. Everything coming from Chef Silvana's kitchen is probably going to knock your socks off. We also shared the tableside guacamole, which is always good. Sadly, the pomogranates were out of season, so they used dried cranberries (I think).  Though I didn't have it this time, the Verde Posole is the best in town."}
{"text":"Thought it would be better. Food was disappointing, the side of potatoes were cold. The Nogada plate was too sweet and hardly had chicken."}
{"text":"TOTAL RIP OFF! We paid $14 for an 8oz margarita full of ice - wont ever go back - food was flavorless - this place has gone down hill fast - What a total waste of $$$"}
{"text":"Entered the Barrio café and sat down at the bar really friendly staff huge selection of tequila a whole wall of it. Ordered a La Paloma margarita - Patron reposado with grapefruit soda, Mexican Squirt, lime... It was really good it came time to order ordered the Tacos de carne asada - Grilled tenderloin strip tacos with cabbage, queso fresco, salsa Yucateca and avocado with fries... Fries seemed kind of strange but once I dipped it in the special ketchup I was hooked so good the meal rocked I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've dined at Barrio Cafe three times. I have mixed feelings. I really want to love Barrio because I love the concept...fresh, original, Mexican-American-inspired food by an award-winning chef in a non-snooty neighborhood.   The most memorable dish I had was the chicken mole. You get a generous portion. The sauce is a good balance of sweet, spicy, and smokey. The chicken was cooked well, but not very tender. The margarita drinks I had were delicious. The table side guacamole was so-so. Overall, I found the prices to be too high compared to the food and service experiences I've had. It's solid but not stellar.  What bothers me most about Barrio is their execution of the concept. The graffiti-style artwork on the exterior walls is beautiful and shines with Mexican-American cultural pride, but once I walked through the door, I felt like I was in Scottsdale. Once when I was dining at the bar, I overheard a couple of waiters gossip with the bartender and mock a customer who had asked for rice and beans in the dining area. Okay, we get it Barrio, you're hood-hip and gourmet and all, but don't be petty...is it that unreasonable to expect rice and beans on a Mexican restaurant menu?  Perhaps the staff is coached to take on an air of superiority, to beat-down assumptions that the \"gringos\" might have about dining in a Mexican food joint. Whatever it is, it's my impression that the show they put on is hampering the quality of the food and service in some cases. The food and service should stand on its own...no amount of attitude can make up for that."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here. Service was great. The table side guacamole was to die for!! I got the Suzias enchiladas were great. I did not like the margaritas, not sure what it was but they tasted off. The prices were pretty high as well so be prepared."}
{"text":"Another great Sunday Brunch. Queso with chorizo and pomegranate guacamole with home made chips are awesome."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The best I've had, no.  Their horchata was refreshing and not too sweet.  The green posole was tasty, I wish they had garnish to add like authentic posole.  The only down fall was I though it was a bit pricey for Mexican food.  You must take a picture in front of the wall on the side of the building, too!"}
{"text":"The service is top notch.  I was lucky to meet the owner. What a wonderful lady. Her passion for authentic high quality food is obvious.  The house Margarita is delicious.  Excellent selection of tequila and other agave liquors.  Can't go.wrong with any of the food items.   The quac with pomegranate seeds was spectacular.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out but was sadly very disappointed. The service was terrible (very slow, rude and seem to have chip on their shoulder due to the hype of this place), the food was mediocre at best and the margarita was just okay for 9$. I suppose if you want to see what all the buzz is about go, but overall you can find better authentic Mexican food with a lot less pretentiousness than Barrio Cafe..."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're in search of authentic Mexican, this is definitely your place! I've only been a few times but each time was met with great service and fresh, tasty food."}
{"text":"I've been here for the tequila in the past, but my wife and I decided to give the food a go this past weekend. I mean we knew it was going to be good, but the wait for a table has always deterred us in the past. We were lucky enough to snatch a table right away on Saturday night and our server promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. There was a great 2 piece Carribean style band playing at the front of the crowded restaurant! We ordered chips and guac to start and were surprised when it was made tableside with fresh ingredients by our server! I ordered the Mariscos Enchiladas which were delicious but drenched in the crema sauce to the point that i had to dig to find enchilada! A little less would have been perfect I think! Our service was pristine until it came time to pay the check... we waited about 15 minutes after our leftovers had been boxed up for our server to reappear and present us with our check. By this point business had slowed considerably so I was a little confused as to how he forgot about us, but never the less a great dining experience overall!"}
{"text":"Wowwwwww amazing food so delicious tasty and fresh....Best mexican food i ever tasted in Phoenix.... Great customer service and will definately be back...."}
{"text":"Since last review have been back many times and still love the place.  As I stated on prior review, I don't come to Phoenix without stopping here at least once. I would love to see one in San Francisco. The food is very unique and creative.  Fish dishes are excellent.  As others have mentioned it can get crowded and service at times is off (hence the 4 stars).  I typically go at off hours (late) and have had no problems."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I was enticed by the local Phoenix street art and authentic Mexican food. I was not impressed with anything I had there- the guacamole was just okay, the margaritas were not worth $13 apiece, and I had a mango shrimp \"salad\" that consisted of just sliced  fruits on a plate with just 3 shrimp in the middle. Definitely underwhelmed by the food and drinks, and definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"On a recent business trip to Phoenix, this was the highlight of the trip.  I had watched We Live Here on the Fine Living Network and Phoenix was featured.  This was one of the three places on the show and the standout for me.  We came here on our second night in town and was tempted to return on the third night too.  Thanks to the hotel bell-hop/valet we started with the guacamole which is made table-side (nothing new I know) but it came with pomegranate seeds.  They totally worked.  Also, the chips were round small tortillas about 4 times the size of a typical tortilla triangle.  Very tasty!  For my main meal I went with the daily special which was fillet Mignon stuffed with crab.  YUM!  Oh and before I forget, I also had the house margarita which was one of the best I have ever had and the sangria that has Jack Daniels in it.  It totally worked for me!  For dessert we ordered the vanilla crepe but the last one was given to an adjacent table so instead they brought us hot churros with yummy ice cream.  It totally hit the spot.  If I went back again I would try the slow cooked pork.  Oh and a local told me that they have a fabulous brunch too.  Go there!  It is a must in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Sorry.  I'm from Southern California so I'm used to great Mexican food.  We were excited to try this restaurant, since we had read some great things about it.  However, the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre.  We were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals.  The guacamole that was made from one avocado was $11.  The restaurant is in a scary location.  We had to park in a back alley.  It was agreed that the experience was a bust.  If you're in the area and want great food, go to Lon's at the Hermosa, Elements at Sanctuary or True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"Phoenix friends, if you haven't experienced Barrio Café you done know what you are missing.  I anticipated a little taquerid was pleasantly surprised to find this to be do much more.  Guacamole made tableside was excellent, the seasonal Poblano chili dish was amazing. Service was excellent and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Sometimes an outsider can give you a different perspective. . .  I flew in from Denver last night and got taken out to Barrio's without knowing anything about it. First thing you notice is that it's one of those white tablecloth and small neighborhood bistro-type Mexican restaurants that are cropping up all over the bigger cities in the Southwest, these days.  You know that's the case when the server comes over to offer you any one of what he claims are the 250 tequilas they have behind the bar. (!?) He describes a margarita special they're offering made with some brand I've never heard of, agave juice and freshly squeezed lime. Sounds unbelieveable, but turns out to be a tad too subtle for me, and those agave sugars are a bit slippery on my tongue.  So, while I politely acknowledge that the first one was good, I tell him, in response to his question, that I like my margaritas with Don Julio and Cointreau and ask for my next one that way.  First downer, he gets a little snooty about what a  rube I am.  Hey. Mr. Cool. I'm your customer. If I like my margarita with ketchup, your job is to give me an enthusiastic smile and ask, \"one squeeze pack or two?\"   Passing by the margarita moment, we start out with table-made guacamole. It's gets 3 stars for not having enough lime, salt or garlic, but still being pretty good.   They add pomegranate seeds for that bistro flair, but while it comes off as interesting, it's not as good as your well-made traditional guac.  They serve their sit-down table salsa with another somewhat contrived bistro element: bread and not chips. Roasted peppers, however, made it pretty tasty, so I'm not complaining.  On to dinner, and actually, that's what gets them up to 4 stars:  their chile en nogada,  I think they call it, was a large poblano chile stuffed with chicken, apricots, peaches (? and another \"!\"), garlic and almonds in a light cream sauce. Very very nice and unusual.  The server said it was a traditional dish from the Puebla area, and it was excellent and finger licking good. A bit of spice finished the dish and made it memorable.  Dessert, on the other hand, was a mediocre flan. A bit too heavy, with no subtlety at all.  Bottom line: creative food, a good attempt at bistro dining, tarnished only a little by a self-impressed server, and prices a bit on the high side. Nonetheless, I'm a fan and would go back.   When I started this review I was going to comment on how strange it was that some people gave it 5 stars and others gave it 1 star.  On reflection, I get it. This place is neat, but a bit too cocky for its own good, and that can make some people pretty upset.  My guess is that Phoenix is big enough to keep this place around for a long time, and that the food and drinks, while somewhat over-priced, will keep em coming back. Thanks, Phoenix, for a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"Great little place, the guacamole made at your table is good as are the tacos-we bad both the fish and the pork.  It was crowded and I think over priced, but still good food!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely top-notch. I've never eaten anything there that wasn't lick-the-plate delicious.  That said, the place is crowded and noisy, which really detracts from a pleasant dining experience for me. There are times you can't get close to it, the wait is so long.  If you go early, sometimes there's no wait. I think the prices are a bit high, but the food is worth it. The ambiance isn't. Parking is extremely limited in an alley behind the place. This is an issue if you don't know where you're going."}
{"text":"Barrio cAfe was a nice change of pace from all the other places that try to modernize Mexican cuisine Barrio pulls it off because the changes from authentic fare are subtle and all the traditional flavors are still there Would definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"This is my third time here. Still great food. Decent priced.   Live entertainment on Sunday. Great corn. Try the gawk. It will blow your doors off. Best on the planet.   I love the pork tacos. The catchup with the fries is bomb. Love the smokey pepper in it."}
{"text":"GREAT authentic Mexican restaurant! The food is absolutely out of this world. This is a Phoenix treasure not to be missed."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. We were a small group of 3 and we were immediately seated. The restaurant itself is dimly lit, creating a warm and intimate environment. The fresh table-side guac is a MUST. Don't be discouraged by the pomegranates, they add great texture and taste! Appetizer: Esquite (tasty, especially if you like corn)! and entree: Enchiladas Verde, with an egg on top! Perfection. The only reason for my 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because of the delayed service. We found ourselves waiting a lot and having to flag our waiter on multiple occasions. Otherwise, high quality food and unique spot."}
{"text":"everyone in phx should know about this place by now, award winning for a reason. while everything here is made with care, the real point of my review is to alert people to their happy hour: all of their AMAZING street tacos are $1.50 and its a great way to sample basically every type of meat (and the vegetarian ones!)"}
{"text":"First. There is no parking. It was all full.  Second. I was told that there was a 39 minute wait unless I sat at the bar.   I sat at the bar.  Very nice and friendly bar tender set me up with tablecloth etc.   Recommended different vegetarian dishes.   They don't serve chips and salsa by default. You get sourdough bread and red pepper and olive tapenade. Very tasty.   I ordered the mushroom and spinach enchiladas.  They don't serve beans.   The air conditioning does not handle the people ovens and outdoor temps. It is hot in here.   They turned away several parties of 5 or more because of their wait times.    Dinner took a long time coming.   The enchiladas were more like small tacos in a corn tortilla. The cheese was excellent and the mushrooms and spinach as well.   Every well done. THere was a side of corn and onions and zucchini.   There was a sour cream topping. THis is recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I live this place. It's intimate and the food is great. My favorite are the  shrimp and fish tacos.  Silvana was nice enough to show up the expansion where she is opening a bar.  We showed up just before opening and she was standing outside and I had to tell her that I lives the food.  She was welcoming enough to say hello and show us what she wanted to do.   She asked us about expanding out west but I said avoid Avondale because people don't spend money and there isn't a lot to do there locally anyway. I said try Peoria or Noeth Phoenix. Hopefully she'll listen so I can visit more often."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely out of this world.. Wasn't even upset I wait nearly 2 hours on a cramped patio however I was bothered by shrek, your bartender you had working at 7:45pm.. He needs an attitude adjustment or maybe he just needs to leave his feelings off the clock.. Our waitress was the best however; totally recommend this place to anyone who loves Mexican food .. Would have given 5 stars if Rico suave hadn't been \"running the bar\""}
{"text":"I had  read this was voted one of the best Mexican restaurants in USA so had to check it out Cannt believe this isn't the number 1 on yelp for Mexican food . when we visit Phoenix you can bet we will come back.  Loved everything about it .. the decor  .. the service .. the live music/ acoustic guitar  .. the FOOD and margarita ! and the art the building the the surrounding area had just amazing street Art murals. Not sure if this area is safe but i did walk around with my camera because the art was worth the risk.            the guac with pomegranate seeds .. they make it at our table and you wouldnt thing pomegranate would go with the Guac but it was AMAZING.  could have listened to the live music all day. .. so fun."}
{"text":"I went while in Phoenix for spring training. I was very excited to try and it was highly recommended by my family in the area.  It turned out to be one of the most disappointing and bad visits I have ever had. It was very busy when we arrived which did not surprise us at all as we had heard so much about this restaurant. We ordered or drinks the bartender forgot one of the drinks and was rather rude about asking what the drink order was.  We ordered shrimp quesadillas and queso for the appetizers. They were tasty and arrived as expected. A nice start to dinner.   Our mains were duck breast and mole chicken breast. At least a half hour later our mains had not arrived, our section of the restaurant had emptied out and our server had disappeared. We were discussing tracking down our food and a new server arrived with our food. I took a bite of my mole and is was very cold and the polenta was the same temp as was when it had been recently refrigerated. I then tried my boyfriend's duck which was also cold. I got up and found a server in the next room and all I said was  'our food is cold\" she, with out a word, removed the mains from our table. Our server eventually returned and we okay with waiting for replacements. They arrived at the proper temp sans the polenta with extra veggies. By this point the restaurant was empty except for a few tables. The meals were flavorful and complex.   They comped our dessert for our inconvenience.    I have only been to a few James Beard award wining restaurants but cannot imagine Chef Silva would win any awards for her Cafe today.  In a metro area as big as Phoenix there must be hundreds of restaurants which would offer a much better experience then Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"I really wish I was more hungry when I ate here.  The food is not the \"traditional\" Mexican food I am used to.  The margaritas are okay.  I don't think they are anything special.  I only tried the Lowrider Margarita.  The next time I am in town I will try the other ones.  My friend and I shared the Kuali de Camaron which consisted of roasted jalapeño with cheese, chile, an avocado slice and shrimp.  The food was very flavorful, but not spicy.  I was expecting a little kick, but there wasn't any.  My friend had the Chiles en Nogada which contained a roasted poblano pepper with chicken, apple pear, dried apricots and and pecans, almond cream sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds.  On the side was chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies.  This is the chef's signature dish, and it was a very flavorful dish.  I took a couple bites and wished I had enough room in my stomach to have a plate of my own.  The waitress was very nice and checked on us several times.  I LOVE the Chicano art both inside the restaurant and outside."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. The food and service was just okay. Nothing special but not bad. I spent around $100 on lunch for my wife and my 2 toddlers split a plate. It was a little pricey. The lemonade was the best part of the whole experience but at $5.50 without any alcohol, it seems overpriced. I dont think I've ever had a tab that had $20+ for just lemonade lol.  As far as the service, they took a while to get us out of there. My two toddlers were going nuts.   Overall, I gave this place 3 stars because they were okay. Can't say they were bad but I also cant say they were good.  Thank you,"}
{"text":"First time here. The food was very good. Big portion size meals so I guess the price is worth it. So many items to chose from but still simple to the point menu. I ordered pollo en mole black it was good hubby got shrimp enchiladas super delish we also got dessert hubby said best flan and I say delish curros. Small inside tight tables. But I would try it again."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  The guacamole was excellent and included craisins, an unconventional but delicious spin on the dish.  On our waiter's recommendation I ordered a stuffed pepper dish with chicken, a cream sauce, and pomegranate.  It was a perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here just this weekend. Came in around 7 and it was busy, but not packed. There was a band playing and the hostess quickly greeted and seated my friend and I. We had heard many good reviews of this place and were excited to try it for ourselves. As I'm not a huge fan of margaritas (crazy, I know), I opted for the michelada. It was fantastic with just the right amount of heat and the cayenne salt on the rim added that extra kick. We started with the tableside guacamole and like so many others have said, it was great. I enjoyed that it was chunky with a little added sweetness. For my main entree I chose the Cochinita Pibil meal. I love the many varieties of pulled pork out there and this was scrumptious. I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing and ended up taking part of it home for breakfast the next morning (it reheats wonderfully, plus throw a fried egg on top and yum!). My friend decided on the chicken torta and she very much enjoyed her meal. She thought the spicy fries were perfectly seasoned and loved that the ketchup had a smoky flavor that was undoubtedly homemade. We did not have enough room for dessert, sadly. The service was well-paced and our server took the time to happily explain anything on the menu we might have questions about. I would certainly return. This is a great Phoenix hotspot."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent! They give you bread with an olive tapenade, assume it was housemade, it was really good. Had the house special Chiles en nogada, it was stuffed with chicken, apricots, apple, pear, topped with an almond cream sauce. Delicious. Others had the torta del barrio, it was great, and the pork pibil torta, delicious with pickled onions. The house veg and side salad were great, salad had a really good vinaigrette. Caution-you might have to wait a while-we didn't have reservations and had to wait at least 30-45 min, but it was Saturday... totally worth it. Dessert was the chocolate cake, it was moist with a molten like center, def recommend this. The best part of the meal: sangria with mango puree. Def a place for foodies."}
{"text":"Dine out for Life!   De-Freakin-Licious !   Had the Tata Salad. Wow. Best salad ever! Must have it. One friend had the street tacos Carne asada without the tortillas and wow delicious too. Well this place amazed me.  Oh yeah plus the Guacamole with pomegranate. Delicious."}
{"text":"I work right across the street from Barrio Cafe and never went even after hearing so many good things about there food.   I had their shrimp taco's with salad and I have to say it was amazing,great favors.  I would recommend this place and I look forward to trying other items from their menu."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Barrio Cafe so decided to try it out last night.  My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant at 9pm and were told the wait was 30 minutes. It ended up being over 45 minutes and while being shown to our table, we passed at least 3 empty tables - frustrating but what can you do?  While waiting for our table we sat at the bar (in the only two chairs that they have) and ordered a couple of margaritas. The bartender prepared them lightning fast but the taste was off and unbalanced. At $12 a pop, a big disappointment.  For an appetizer, the waiter suggested the lobster quesadillas.  The 4 quesadillas arrived on small corn tortillas - each had cheese, a sweet sauce and one bite sized piece of lobster.  A little awkward to eat and at $16, just not worth it.  For entrees, we chose the \"famous\" cochinita pibil (pork) and the chiles en nogada - two dishes that had gotten great Yelp reviews.  The pork tasted alright but was pretty dry - the side of jus added a little more flavor and moisture, but not enough.  This dish came with the super small taco tortillas, and when we asked for a couple extra, we were told that the kitchen was closed.  The chiles en nogada was an interesting dish, but it had so much going on that all of the flavors were muddled:  roasted poblano, chicken, walnuts, apples, apricot, red sauce, almond sauce, cilantro, pomegranate seeds, cheese...    Two hours and $100 later, we left Barrio Cafe unsatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"Over priced and average tasting. Service was good, very friendly and professional. I would be willing to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place at least 40-50 times over the past 2-3 years and the place has always been one of my top restaurants in town.  However the last 4 times I have been there, service and quality has really gone downhill.    After last night's dinner experience, I probably won't be going back for some time. Prices have always been on the high side, but I didn't have an issue with that when the quality was good.  However last night dinner came to $148 for 2 people -- with no dessert.  Drinks were small and $14 for an average margarita.   My friend and I each had 2 margaritas.  Dirty dishes and glasses were never removed from the table.  My chicken dish was way over cooked -- almost like rubber.  The dish was served with cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes which looked burned.  My friend ordered a steak medium-well.  It came out almost raw on the inside.  When this was brought to the attention of the server, he never apologized and simply grabbed the plate away and later returned with the meat cooked to something that looked medium-rare.  We didn't feel like complaining again.  During the entire dinner I asked 3 times to the server to have our water glasses filled, but it never happened.  I know some places can have an off night, but again this was the 4th time in a row for poor food and service.  I am sad to say that Barrio Cafe is officially off my list."}
{"text":"OMG. there is not much to say other than, AWESOME. Saw the chef Silviana  spotlighted on Diners drive ins and dives, and really saw her passion and genuinely true to self attitude and let me tell you, it all comes together at Barrio. My wife and I were on a short road trip to Phoenix and had to come here to see if it lived up to the hype. 100% lives up to it and more, from the decor, ambiance and culinary delights, my only wish is for a location I  Socal. Genuine, and authentic next time in the area, this is our first stop. This is NOT tourist food, it's the real deal."}
{"text":"Used to be my family's favorite place- but service has gone down - treated like another transaction, and the food has changed entirely."}
{"text":"so good..everytime - year after year.  How many places can we say that about!  take a bow Barrio Cafe!"}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe has been on my bucket list for weeks, so my guy and I decided to go randomly on an early Saturday evening. It was not too busy and more upscale than I expected.  The food was amazing! We started with guac which was mixed tableside with fresh ingredients. For entrees we got the enchiladas suizas (chicken enchiladas with delicious cheese and sauce) and the conchinita pibil (slow-roasted pork with tortillas on the side). Both of our entrees were fantastic. We also tried their margarita and paloma for drinks.  The service was quick and they were very friendly and accommodating. I was impressed! We expected a casual quick dinner and got a really nice experience with authentic fare. I definitely want to come back here again soon and eat more!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was surprised how small the place was. If you're a party of 6 or more, call ahead (assuming they take reservations, I don't know).  That being said - the food was fantastic. I would have given this 5 Stars if it weren't for the VERY slow service. I believe it was an entire hour from sit down to plate placement. Grant it, we weren't ready to order when the waiter first came. But it didn't take us long to decide. There were other tables seated, but nothing he shouldn't have been able to handle.  I ordered the Chiles en Nogada... Holy unexpected surprise of yumminess. Check it out on their website, it was chicken and a concoction of super fabulousness inside the Chile. I made it a point to notice what my date had, but now I've forgotten. He said it was terrific, though (I do believe it was one of their Enchilada dishes).  The bread they serve before seems to be just your average bread but it comes with a really good olive spread.  Parking isn't great. It's a tiny strip mall, but you can probably park on the street of the two side streets there.  You should go. Just be patient and ready to wait. Make sure you're with good company to entertain you while you wait!"}
{"text":"My boss invited my for lunch and we decided to come to Barrio Cafe.  I had never been here but we heard that it was very delicious based on the yelp reviews.  This place is definitely different...it's not your average Authentic Mexican food. The food was definitely fancy and each dish had like 239448759234 ingredients listed [complete exaggeration i know]. I mean, I just wanted a simple Mexican dish but this place is nothing but simple.   Instead of brining your average chips and salsa, it was pieces of bread and a chunky salsa. This was different but delicious.  It forced me to order outside of my comfort zone and so I decided to order a shrimp salad [forgot the name]. It was slices of tomato, red onion, avacado,cucumbers, and a few pieces of shrimp. The dressing was really delicious and worked well. However, for the price I expected maybe a little more shrimp or at least a bed of lettuce.   I do recommend it for people who love to experiment and go outside your average dishes."}
{"text":"I have heard about Barrio Cafe for several years but I really don't know what took me so long to actually try it out?!? I have to admit I usually stick to my favorite places when we go out but we found ourselves downtown after a Dbacks game and finally made the decision to go here.    On a Sunday late afternoon the parking lot was packed. We found street parking nearby and loved looking at all the murals surrounding Calle 16 building. We put our name in and was told 45 min wait! Almost walked out but we put our name in and lucky enough it was about 10 mins and we got a table! Lucky for us because we were starving!  We had to try guacamole made table side and it was awesome! They give you a choice of ingredients and we chose them all and the best was the pomegranate seeds. This was seriously the best guac I've ever had in my life. A little expensive for $12 but after eating it was well worth it.   My wife had the carne tacos and  I had the house speciality Cochinita Pibil. All I can saw was WOW! I loved the slow rosted pork. I even saved some of the guac that we were eating with chips and put that in the tortillas. Wife's carne was also really good.   All in all I loved each and every bite at Barrio. I do believe it was a little too expensive, and thought about giving it 4 stars based on the price but while we were driving home we just couldn't stop talking about how excellent our meal was. This was one if not the best Mexican food I've ever tasted. I will be back here and this is a great restaurant to bring out of town guest."}
{"text":"I had not had Chiles en Nogada since I was employed in Phoenix... when Barrio Cafe first got it's start in 2002. My visit this week coincided with Mexican Independence Week (September 16). Now is a good a time as any to revisit a delectable, beautifully presented Chiles en Nogada... Barrio Cafe style.  My old friend, who was with me today, was forced by me to try out this entree... just as he was with me at Richardson's Cuisine of New Mexico ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/richardsons-cuisine-of-new-mexico-phoenix#hrid:KyAh3bMnKqz4P2xTx6Wl6g ) on 16th Street and Bethany Home yesterday.   On the menu today...  Chiles en Nogada (**** $21.00) Roasted Poblano Pepper stuffed with marinated Chicken, Onions, Garlic, Pecans, Apples, Pears and Apricots topped with a delicate Almond Sauce and Pomegranate Seeds. First of all, Barrio Cafe has diverged from the name of the entree and how the entree derives it's name. Chiles en Nogada literally means Chiles with Walnut Sauce.... not Almond Sauce. Traditionally, this entree is stuffed with Hamburger or slow marinated Pork... not Chicken. This doesn't bother me that much.... the entree was still delicate and delectable! There is a nice diversity of textures when you consume this Relleno, which is served only after Mexican Independence Day. The Pomegranate Seeds \"pop\" nicely in your mouth as you crunch on them; there is a sweet flavor from the Apple, Pear, and Apricot bits. The savory flavor from the Chicken, Onions, and Garlic provides a nice contrast with the sweetness from the fruit bits. Folks, there isn't much time before Pomegranate season is over with. Try it out!  I have to qualify my initial statement that I hadn't had Chiles en Nogada for seven years... I live in Lodi, California now... and I convinced the owner of an upscale, but affordable Mexican restaurant - Alebrijes Mexican Bistro ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alebrijes-mexican-bistro-lodi#hrid:hV7e7lPCf5qn7sOW0Tyz6g ) to prepare Chile en Nogada for me! Alebrijes prepares their Chile en Nogada in the more traditional manner with ingredients specified in the original recipe. If you're in Northern California....  Despite the impression I'm giving that I'm bashing Barrio Cafe's preparation of Chiles en Nogada.... One thing that Barrio does correctly is present the Poblano Chile as if it was roasted... the Chile is a very dark green in color. And the overall flavor tastes South of the Border... whereas the Alebrijes Chile is just too perfect... as if it never saw the Rio Grande!  Side of Mashed Potatoes, Grilled Yellow Squash, Cucumbers, and White Onions (*****)  Grilled Perfectly!  Organic Margarita (***** $13.00) Tequila from 4 Copas - Organic Silver Tequila (claims to be the world's ONLY certified Organic Tequila... got to take their word on that claim...) with Organic Agave Nectar, Pomegranate Juice and  Grapefruit Juice. Sweet, Sweet, Sweet.... but GOOD!  Imported Bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola (***** $2.50)  Cafe de la Casa Barrio (**** $8.00) Barrio's own Special Blend of Chiapas Iztapa Coffee served in a cool shiny stainless steel French Press. You've got to try this if you're going Mexican - Your presence in Barrio Cafe mandates Mexican coffee and with it a sense of foreignness, sunshine and fun... and you don't have to worry about a passport. Not as strong as the Coffees from countries South of Mexico... ala Colombia. But, the Coffee is stronger than your garden variety American canned Coffee. A question I have is: Where is the Mexican Coffee with Cinnamon???  Service (*****) Friendly and prompt. The waiter happened to be the brother of the Owner / Chef, Silvana Salcido. The brother / waiter, a Civil Engineer, moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas caused by the downturn in the housing market.   My friend, who is NOT a Mexican Cuisine afficionado, says Barrio Cafe is far better than Richardson's in quality and presentation.  Profusely presented, hopefully for a short period of time, are small (no more than 18\"x18\") paintings by Nikki Aiello... a local Yoga instructor who, it seems, is delving into ethnic painting.  They're no more than a couple of hundred dollars each. My advice to Nikki... \"Don't quit your day job!\" I guess, Barrio Cafe had to fill up the wall space with something...  I hope I don't have to wait another seven years before I try Chiles en Nogada again from Barrio Cafe! But... Please go back to Beef or Pork as the meat filling!"}
{"text":"Chicken enchilada suizas are delicious! I ordered them with the optional chorizo. Highly recommend them! Parking is in back at this restaurant and there is a lot of cool graffiti artwork back there.   Restaurant is small and comfortable."}
{"text":"I loved eating at Barrio Cafe!  Miranda, if I remember her name correctly, was absolutely amazing!  She waited on my boyfriend and I as if she was working in a 5 restaurant. She communicated ingredients to us in such a friendly way to make sure we had no allergies.  It was a Sunday so the beer options were a little slim, Miranda had to break the news twice that my boyfriend's choice wasn't available. She was so professional that we didn't care. She could have told us again and we still wouldn't care!  We hope to see her soon at her regular location.  The food was spectacular too.  We especially like the touch of having our guac made fresh in front of us.  Until next time...."}
{"text":"What an awesome first experience and we will return again!! The service was excellent and just the right amount of food to satisfy your stomach. Everything on the menu is fabulous. The photos taken were the favorites. The artistic design of the outside of the building to the simplest white walls inside was a perfect balance."}
{"text":"Love this place- so good! Guac has pomegranate seeds which is a cool flavor. Enchiladas are super filling and cheesy."}
{"text":"There is not a bad thing on the menu. You must, must, must try the guacamole made table side.   Their cochonita pabil which is seasoned pulled pork is also outstanding. If you are here from September to April, the fruit stuffed Chiles en Nogada is a must!!  I come here every time I come to Phoenix which I quarterly. They also have a location in the airport that delivers the same quality food but a smaller menu."}
{"text":"\"Comida chingona\" for sure ! If you want higher end mexican, give this place a try! The Guava mimosas were sooo good! I tried a little bit of the cochinita pibil and although im not a fan of pork I did find it rather tasty! I liked my enchiladas but I'd have to say the spinach crepes were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Glad I finally tried this place. Food was ornate, flavorful, beautifully presented. A delicate blend of flavors. My dish the Chiles En Nogada was very Autumn like. Aromatic, sweet... Chicken, apples, pears, pecans, onions, garlic, almonds chopped and stuffed into a Poblano chile, lightly covered with a nice almond cream sauce. To one side a dash of cilantro, bits of Pomegranate on the other. Everything tasted like it was meant to be there, every ingredient made perfect sense together, leaving a smile after each bite. This dish was unique and like nothing I have tasted elsewhere. As previous reviewers have mentioned, yes this place is a bit more on the nicer, upscale side, I suppose if pressed I would call it some sort of creative Mexican fusion. If you are looking for dive-y authentic burritos, tacos and enchiladas this is not the place, there are a million other places in the area offering that style of Mexican food where the Mexican folk are lined out the door. I love those places just as much... for everything that they have to offer. Now if you want a unique, original, clever, new take on the Mexican dining experience then you should definitely give this place a try and see for yourself what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Went to this place this morning absolutely amazing! Their service was beyond amazing! Our server Ceaser was the best!!! I also saw this show on DDD! And this one met my expectations..... keep up the great work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Man oh man... Jack Daniels Sangria! I know I should write about the food, but the drinks here are great too! Impressive tequila selection and inventive cocktails support the raves reviews on the cuisine here.  On a personal note, I had a chance to chat with Sylvana (the owner) who is just incredible. Food and dining is in her her blood... literally! Her ancestors were royal pastry chefs.   She committed to strengthening the local community through her food. There's heart behind her cooking which keeps me coming back again and again.   Specifically, any of the seafood dishes are killer!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out. The services sucks, food was cold, and we were stuff in a corner. Im so disappointed the food look so good on tv and Picture.  Tiny little chili pepper, no sauce, no flavor for $24. I wouldnt recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here twice this trip and as always it was amazing! Brought 3 friends and they were blown away. They all said they hated avocados and were hesitant to try the guacamole but once they tried it, it was every man for them selves! Each dish was amazing and prepared perfectly. Thank you again to everyone there for an amazing visit."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I first moved here 10 years ago and I love it! Chef Silvana rocks it out with her amazing menus. A Phoenix staple for sure. Don't forget the guacamole!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I dont go as often as I should but every time I do I am never disappointed. I read many reviews about it being over priced and I have to agree with one of the last reviewers and say NO. If you are in to average Mexican food with melted cheese and meat inside hard corn tortillas meant to resemble taco's then yes, this is not the place to go. If you want quick not bad Mexican food, there are a couple of places with in walking distance from Barrio. That being said the food here is regional its a little french aka rich in taste but not pretentious. I really have never had anything here I did not rave about for at least 2 hours afterward, sometimes days. The cochinita pibil and the yucca that accompanies it is a comfort food like no other! who needs pot roast and mashed potatoes? The mushroom filled enchiladas bring creamy and earthy together beautifully, I can go on and on..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dinner I've had in a LOOOONG time!!!! I had the torta cochinita pibil.. and let me tell you something... I went to pork heaven tonight! Omg... I've never had pork so tender and juicy. I got the fries with it and the spicy ketchup that came with it was perfect!! Hands down the best torta I've had in my life (sorry mom. Barrio café wins). My brother had the carne asada tacos and they were just as good!! My aunt and mom had the posole verde. You guys..... me personally, I don't like posole, but once I've tasted this one, I had a flavor explosion in my mouth!! Very well seasoned, the pork chunks were just as tender like the torta! And to end tonight's dinner, the restaurant gave us a complementary \"Flan de mi mami,\" UUGGGHHH! It was so creamy, smooth, and just amazing! With fresh strawberries and candies nuts. So perfect!! Thank you Gabriella for an amazing dinner and being the best waitress! We'll be back for sure!! If you guys want this experience, go to Barrio Café!! We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really good food but prices are too high for what you get.  Oh and when you order chips and salsa, they give you chips and black beans and a little tiny salsa. lol."}
{"text":"High prices, small portions. Poor service.  This was my second time there. The first was a happy hour visit. I tried a variety of tacos and enjoyed them.......at happy hour prices. But the dinner menu charges more than $13 for three tacos, served with soggy french fries (or salad), served with a ketchup which seemed to maybe have some canned chipotle tossed in. Not impressive at all.  My water glass was not filled for almost 30 minutes. I finally flagged down a bus boy to fill it. Our waitress seemed too distracted to give us any attention, and she forgot to bring out an extra side of ketchup for me. The portion was tiny, but it didn't matter because it wasn't very good anyway.  If this was a $2 taco joint, I'd be OK with everything. But at the prices they charge, they had better step it up. And they did not do that.  I won't bother going back. I know of a taco truck at the Lowes parking lot in Prescott that makes killer tacos for $2 each, with plenty of amazing salsas. I'd rather ride up 89 to Prescott and enjoy the tacos when I get there."}
{"text":"Authenticity and Fresh flavors abound at this Phoenix eatery. Menu offerings were exceptional from the beverages through to the main courses. Flor de Jamaica Margarita was especially noteworthy as was the Queso Fundido (possibly the best I've ever found). Service was great, even though we happened to arrive not too long before closing. Everyone at our table was pleasantly pleased with our meal. Thank you for getting it!"}
{"text":"Chicken poblano and carne asasa tacos...very good.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  Great find"}
{"text":"Good for brunch.  They have more traditional Mexican food selections such as chorizo and eggs, and huevos rancheros, in addition to more fusion type brunch items such as seafood crepes.  I had the chorizo and eggs, which was very well prepared.  The eggs were perfectly done (over easy), the chorizo was flavorful and spicy, and the potatoes were perfectly grilled.  Prices are on the more expensive side for what you get (10 dollars and up), and some items such as aguas frescas will run you a whopping $5 for a glass, but all in all it was a nice meal.  Therefore, 4 stars for the meal, but minus a star for the prices."}
{"text":"Cute upscale cafe but the food didn't seem worth the price.  My friends and I went as part of the Dining Out for Life fundraising day because Barrio was donating 100% of its proceeds to fighting AIDS.  Maybe it was because we went on that day, but it seemed that service was sorely lacking and the food was dry.    I had the Tacos de Cochinita Pibil which was tasty except the pulled pork was dry.  My friend got the Pollo Poblano which was also dry.  We got the pomegranate guacamole which was EXCELLENT and probably the only redeeming thing about our meal that day."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the restaurant on a replay of an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives yesterday. Neither us had been there before so we decided to make a trip today. Parking is in the back and has several available spots. It is along an alley which has a lot of excellent murals painted on the walls. I highly recommend a walk after the meal to check them out and work off a little of the food.   No chips and salsa in this Mexican restaurant. Instead it is a plate of fresh bread and a tapenade. I saw one review mention it was very salty, and usually everything tastes salty to me. I didn't notice it here. It tasted mostly like pimentos to me. My wife did not like it, but I enjoyed it.  She ordered the Chiles en Nogada, which was a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, apple, pear, dried apricot and pecans. It was in an almond cream sauce and the plate had some pomegranate seeds as well. She enjoyed it and I was able to negotiate a couple of bites as well. The sauce was creamy and a nice balance to the fruits inside the pepper.   I ordered Cochinita Pibil which was pork marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted overnight. On top of that was pickled red onion and Yucatán-style pico de gallo. The pork was the size of a Sunday pork roast and the banana made it so tender it fell apart at the touch of a fork. I'm a big guy and I couldn't finish half of it - fortunately a box home held the rest.   The one thing that might be surprising was the price. It was a little more expensive than I thought when I walked in. I thought maybe $10-$12 per plate, but both of ours were over $20. The bill for the two entrees and a fountain coke (my wife had water) was $51.00. But it was very good and definitely worth it. I would like to try the horchata, which the menu states is award-winning.  So it sounds like a repeat trip will be necessary."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pulled pork and guac I've ever had. It was worth the lengthy wait and the over priced tecate!"}
{"text":"A highlight of our visit to Phoenix.   I love hot & spicy food but that was the hottest Pozole I've ever had. Delicious!  I hiccuped & sweated thru every spoonful."}
{"text":"Prepare for a shift in perspective...  Too many times, Mexican food is rather typical.  In fact it's likely that, with few variances and exceptions, predictions prevail.  Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Café.  When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.  At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...  \"Chiles en Nogada,\" as explored by Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,\" is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the \"Chiles en Nogada\" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Café is to appreciate that vision."}
{"text":"Walking up to the place I quickly was happy because it seemed as if I was going to eat authentic mexican food. This was shortly lived because as I was sat in my table I noticed not a single Hispanic was in the restaurant. My thought was, ooooh boy here we go again another so called authentic Mexican restaurant with Americanized food. But let me tell you, I was greatly surprised. So this is what my meal consisted of. We ordered Agua de Limón, Enchilada Suezas and Chile En Ahogada. The Agua de Limon tasted amazing and unlike other places that say that their lemonade is fresh when it really is not it was not bitter/sour. It had the perfect mixture of ice,lemon and sugar. The Enchiladas Suezas were another amazing dish. The white sauce, complemented with the bacon and grilled chicken was perfect and would recommend. Last but definitely not the least was the Chile en Ahogada. OMFG, I literally got a foodgasm. If you are in this restaurant you cannot leave without eating a Chile En Ahogada. It's probably top 10 in my list of the best foods I have tried in my life. I hope my comments assist anything in making a decision where to eat. Best of luck to everyone and I hope my comments here assist you a bit I'm taking a decision."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good... but the service ruined everything for me.  Our server was rude... it seemed like he got even more rude when he found out we were only ordering appetizers.  He not once asked if we needed refills on our drinks, and when we asked him for refills, he only took one glass out of a table of 7.  Won't ever come here again. Oh and... they took our plate without even asking if we were done... and we weren't."}
{"text":"The two times I have eaten at Barrio I have been extremely lucky to be seated right away, I have drove past before where the line is out the door!  It can get so extremely touristy-busy! (Which is a great thing!)  I sat at the bar and ordered my al-time-favorite drink, Horchata!  Now, now... you ALREADY KNOW it would of been a margarita or two but I was driving and I was driving 30 minutes back home to the East Valley. Otherwise, it woulda been on! I ordered a specialty item on the menu the server backed me up with a guarantee i was going to love it which I absolutely did. The Chile's de nogada is a fiesta in your mouth, reading the description on the menu could throw you off a bit because of the 'pomegranate seeds' but it compliments the meal perfectly. My leftovers heated up beautifully since the portions are large. Service is impeccable but beware that it's still a small, authentic restaurant. The restroom is teeny tiny and it's very dim throughout the restaurant.  I asked if it was ok to take the Mexican coca-coca glass home and our server said yes because they grow them away! Gah! A lovely souvenir.  Barrio also has an airport location which is AMAZING since travelers can try the food without the hassle of finding parking and waiting for a table. No fair! Okay, now I'm craving BC again."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!! Not your typical taco or nacho place. A must try!!!! I love that chef Silvana is true to her beliefs and is proud of her heritage! The pride shows in her food and awesome staff!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on DDD. Had the dish featured on DDD, Chile's en Nogada it was good but a little to sweet for me. Place is a little pricey for traditional Mexican food. Place very trendy but had live music that was fun and service was good for being so busy."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I saw it on the Diners Drive ins and Dives show on the plane ride from NYC to Arizona and had to add this place to my list. The sauce on my dish was crazy delicious it was like Mexico and France had a baby."}
{"text":"Recommended by DDD and it didn't disappoint. There is a parking lot although there is residential parking in the area if that gets full. Pretty good size restaurant but I think it can get really busy at times. We went on a late Thursday so we didn't have to wait. There was a good lunch crowd but not too bad. They do not take reservations.  The guacamole is really unique since it has pomegranate seeds (gave it a bit of sweetness) in them and was a really good start to the lunch meal. Chips were fresh and crispy. I got the fish tacos and my hubby got the Pollo Poblano. The spicy mash that came with his chicken was super tasty and went perfectly with it. Great place and worthy of its praise."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying chiles en nogada. I cannot judge this dish is authentic or not but I can say it was very delicious. It was an amazing combination of food taste. If you never had this dish, I highly recommend to try it."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome, saw this spot on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives a couple of years ago and remembered it when I was in town on vacation. I'm glad we came here for lunch/dinner. The portions were big and the food was very good, not your regular mexican food which I really liked.   I ordered the famous chile relleno and it was sooooo good, I've had some good chile rellenos in the past but this one was different, stuffed with chicken, cheese, fruit and I believe nuts and topped with this awesome sauce and pomegranates, very Azteca which I loved. The side of mashed potatoes were especially good too, they had a little spice to them and they also gave a side of veggies, the dish was huge. My sis ordered the Cochinita Pibil tacos and those were also very good, three tacos stuffed with marinated pork and topped with pickled onions, what else can you ask for?   Don't forget to get an order of the guacamole while you wait for your food, that too was delicious. We also tried to horchata which was divine and a mixed drink with horchata mixed in it ( I forgot the name). If I ever come back to the Phoenix area, I'd definitely make this a \"must dine\" again. The only thing I didn't like about it was it's a bit small and we waited for a table for a while when the dining room didn't seem too full, and it was a bit expensive, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Barrio does not take reservations.  I was a little apprehensive about throwing a surprise birthday party there.  We showed up, announced I needed seating for eight at 6:30... and was seated about 90 seconds later.    What do you say about the food?  Not sure how it could improve.  Best guac (I hate guacamole) on the planet.  My foodie guests were delighted.    We will be back."}
{"text":"Long wait, no parking, GRReat food, good service."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! This place is in the up and coming area around 16th Street and Thomas. The décor is cool and the service isn't bad. But you came for the food, right? And it just wasn't that good.  I ordered the tacos with their house specialty marinated pork and it was just bland. My wife had the carne asada tacos and they were ok. But for $15, they should have been awesome. At one point we asked for chips and salsa and we're told \"We don't do chips and salsa.\" You can be as pretentious as you want, but that plays better when the food is good. Overall, this place doesn't live up to the expectation.  And oh yeah, there was no hot sauce on the table."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Have the guacamole made at your table.  They use pomegranate seeds in many dishes.  Really interesting dishes that are delicious. Park in the back, cool murals all along the block walls.   Parking can be tight."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I ever have eaten. My date said it best, \"I've died and gone to Mexican food heaven.\"  My mom had lamb on special. It was superbly cooked, with one side slightly crisp and the other delightfully tender. Garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly grilled zucchini rounded out her plate.  I had shrimp tacos, which were plump, juice and fresh. The complimentary guacamole made fresh at the table with avocado, cilantro, tomato, pomegranate, salt and pepper put me on another planet.  My cousin always orders the pulled pork torta, which is amazing and gigantic.  And my lady had halibut topped with lobster, shrimp, crab and scallops -- a seafood-lover's dream.  The only low point on the menu is the sangria, which she returned to the server in favor of a glass of quality red wine.   I refuse to visit Phoenix without making a stop at Barrio."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went to Barrio Cafe to celebrate our boss' birthday.  We were very dissappointed.  Thought the food was ok, the service was HORRIBLE.  From the beginning, the waiter appeared as if though we were bothering him and wished we werent there.  I have never eaten at a location where the waiter only gives water to the guests and never bothers to take a drink order.  The food order took a ridiculous amount of time.  ALL of the tables that were around us that were seated AFTER we had ordered, were finised with their meal before we were even served ours.  When we asked the waiter about our order, he very rudely informed us that our food would be served when it was done.  WOW, that is some amazing customer service.  We asked to speak to the manager but that did not do anything.  When our food was being served, the waiter informed us that our food took exactly 23 minutes, though it had been 1 hour since we had ordered.  Nice to know that the waiter waited 40 minutes to put in our order and no, we did not order any appetizers.  Needless to say, I will never return to this restaurant.  I would much rather eat at the local Ranch Market than return to Barrio Cafe.  It is unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place.    The food was OK but not anything that WOWed me enough to return after such horrible service.  We all honestly thought we were in one of those hidden camera shows like \"Boiling Points\" because he was sure pushing it.    It would have also been nice to have been informed of the $1 per person plate charge for our cake that we brought in.  He could have at least cut and served the cake for that price.  All he did was bring us plates but did not provide us with a knife or anything.  I would NOT recommend Barrio Cafe to anyone, much less a group of more than 2."}
{"text":"Delicious, fun and a great atmosphere. They don't take reservations so you just have to test your luck on any given night. It was my first time here for valentines and we had a blast. Having lived in Austin, I can really appreciate the mexican art inside and out. Also, if you are a tequila fan, they have over 250 to taste! Richard, the bar tender, makes it worth sitting at the bar if you have to wait for a table. The food is fresh and very satisfying. I recommend for a casual night or even a special event."}
{"text":"Quick & delicious!! Probably the best burrito ive ever had, they really hustle to serve your order here so that you dont miss your flight. Reasonable sized portions"}
{"text":"After all the hype it sucks to say I was disappointed. The food is too overpriced too match the quality, not saying it's bad but the quality isn't tastey enough to match the prices. I ordered the suizas and it was $22 for just four small corn enchiladas that consisted of way too much cheese you can't taste anything else but cheese. Oh and it comes with a small plate of veggie like mixture. After still being hungry I didn't want to risk it. On the plus the horchata is delicious and worth the buck"}
{"text":"You have to go to this place during happy hour! 3-5 Tues - Fri: 1/2 off drinks and $1.50 tacos. They have about 5 or 6 different types of tacos and they are small like street tacos. I had the fish, shrimp, & shredded pork tacos. I couldn't choose which one was my favorite, because they were all really good.   They have so many types of Tequila too. I had a great margarita with 100% agave. Later we ordered some guacamole which is delicious. They mix pomegranate seeds in the mix with tomatoes, onions, and avocado. I think they normally make it table side, but they were pretty busy when I went in there.  The service was great, our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu items as well as the drinks. She recommended items to us that would satisfy what we were looking for. The place has some great art surrounding the walls. They also have murals outside on the alley side. It's quite refreshing seeing this art instead of graffiti coming up to a place. Well done!"}
{"text":"From the decor, service, to the food everything was excellent.  I never had an empty drink, dirty dishes were removed promptly, food served quickly, and your meal comes with complimentary bread. Love me some bread & places that offer it.   My husband and I ordered the guacamole & chips ($11.75), carne asada tacos w/ fries ($13), the suiza enchiladas topped w/ chorizo ($20), and churro rellanos for dessert ($12). Drinks: Diet Coke ($2.75) & pressed coffee ($3.50)  The guac was mixed with pomegranates, cilantro and onion. It was a different take on guac but delicious. Carne asda tacos on point. The fries come crispy & spicy but was able to get them without the spice. Definitely take the servers recommendation to top the enchiladas with chorizo my husband is picky and he enjoyed the dish. The churros were warm & gooey with caramel paired with vanilla bean ice cream. Also, I've never had pressed coffee and now I don't think I can drink it any other way. Thanks to the barrio for that. The building itself is covered in graffiti art. If you get there when they open you're able to take pictures without cars blocking the view. Inside the restaurant they have paintings that go along with the theme. Our server was one of the best we've had and made our experience that much better. Parking is in the back."}
{"text":"It's as good and interesting as most of the posts speak to. But what I was attracted to just as much was the work of the valley's urban mural artists who have seem to found a safe haven in the Calle 16 neighborhood and Barrio Cafe building. We ate at the bar. Portions are big so my husband and I shared the slow roasted pork (very tasty and a lot of food so I'm glad I shared it), guacamole with pomegranate (was a nicer texture than expected), a crepe dessert (almost too sweet) and a horchata in a 0.5L Old school Coke bottle. \"Chicago\" the bar tender shared stories of his travels and our conversations drifted to living a more authentic life... Hmmm. It always about the connections you make then the places you've been:)"}
{"text":"Chiles en Nogada. Life changing. Waiter asked how it was, my response, \"Best thing I have eaten in my life.\" Really! I have lived in Phoenix now for almost two years and the only time I wear any authentic Mexican food is when I travel home to SD. Now I have found a little slice of heaven here in downtown Phoenix. Love the graffiti artwork around the building, fun photo opps! My husband had the tres tacos, pescado, and they were also amazing. I wanted to try the Agua de Horchata but they were out sadly. Next time!!!  FIVE STARS"}
{"text":"Love it  but the noise level is a bit too much for my ears- I think they need something on the walls that will absorb sound - tapestries maybe ? The food is crazy good though so I go to Barrio Urbano where the noise is less jarring and the food is still wonderful."}
{"text":"Gotta try the mole poblano!  Great regional Mexican food,  authentic and well decorated inside.  Paintings for sale from local artists spruce it up.  Also check out the Barrio queen for abit more casual Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Check out Happy Hour.  3-5 Monday thru Friday.  Barrio Bomba drink and White Sangria are amazing."}
{"text":"I ate at Barrio Cafe for the first time today. Heard about it on Diners Drive-Ins & Dives. My meal was the Pollo Poblano and it was absolutely delicious!!!  Service was great too!!  Olive spread & bread served on the table (instead of chips & salsa) was awwwwwesome!!!  Everything was fresh and tasty. We had the flan for dessert - soooo good!! :-D"}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant.  The guac, Pozole verde, cochinita pibil and the churroe are my usual order. Fantastic service and food. The bar is spectacular too, they have a terrific tequila and mescal selection. Their michelada is amazing too. I bring all my fiends here and, if I were to die tomorow, this would be my last meal."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the food ... just not the packed, no space eating atmosphere where everyone is touching everyone. I actually would give the food 4+ stars ... the sitting dining atmosphere 2- stars. Dear owner - we live in PHX, AZ NOT Tokyo, Japan ... give me some freaking space to eat ... until then (I get more space) I will not return. I will miss your food ..."}
{"text":"Awesome food, love the murals, love the ambience, though the wait was a little long and there were two sizable flies hanging out on the window next to us that made me feel like someone in the vicinity was listening in on our conversation (I may have been binge-watching Ray Donovan recently, maybe).  We came out here for a celebratory lunch, were seated almost immediately, our waitress gave us a quick rundown of the popular menu items which was much appreciated since some of us were new to Barrio Cafe.  The choices were vast, and I was so torn between several menu items I ended up just going with the first thing that came to mind when the waitress asked for my order.  I wound up with the filetitto torta which was really reasonably priced ($16).  This is going to sound rather odd but I really appreciate the range of prices of their menu items.  You have things that are in the low teens, and some that go into the high twenties, making it accessible for people who are on a budget (like yours truly) and people coming in for special occasions such as anniversaries, birthdays, and the like.  The torta was amazing.  Huge piece of meat, topped with chorizo and I'm not sure what else cause I was too busy wolfing it down.  It looked glorious, for the short time it was on my plate.  I regret getting their spicy fries, not because they weren't good but because the salad looked so much better - I don't remember exactly what was in it (the dried cranberries did catch my eye), but it was definitely not your regular house salad.  My boss ordered the carne asada tacos which I actually almost ordered but am glad I didn't.  I guess they weren't quite as good since the response I got to \"how were the tacos?\" was \"they weren't as good as yours looked\".  My only gripe was that it seemed like we were waiting for our food for quite a while but maybe our order just took a little longer to cook so I'm not too bothered by that.  I'm definitely ordering their crepes next time I stop by cause damn, did they look good.  Pretty much all of us were eyeing the neighboring table's dessert the minute it came out, I'm not even kidding.  Maybe I'll just order that crepe as my main course.  Nope, I need to have that torta again. Or maybe try something new.  Hmm."}
{"text":"So sad to give this place a 3/5 because I really wanted to like it a lot. I think I hyped it up too much in my head I don't know. Have to say though that considering the price I wasn't super impressed.  You can definitely tell that the chefs are working with quality product but overall it's not that amazing. Again I feel very bad for saying anything but amazing comments but these are my thoughts.   Service : outstanding Ambiance : cozy and colorful Food : good"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!  Loved the guacamole and the crepe dish.  Great live music as well.  A must!"}
{"text":"Excellent environment! The live music set the tone! Very soothing music with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place. Lobster quesadilla, pollo poblano, mole, fresh table side guac with special treats like cranberries or pomegraite thrown in. Cool art, friendly staff and the best damn sangria in town!"}
{"text":"Now looking at the reviews, I expected to be wow'd. Uhhhhhh no. Maybe we went at the wrong time. It was about 6:30 on a Friday so maybe that's not it. Anyway, we arrived and it was like a 35 minute wait which was fine because we excepted that on a Friday evening. We got seated at a table RIGHT IN FRONT of the guitar player. I mean, he was playing some jams but is it necessary to have tables so close to where he's performing? Could barely hear what my friend was saying.  I ordered the carne asada tacos with the spicy fries. The fries were pretty good with that sauce you dip them in. The tacos were kind of bland though and small. You get complementary bread and some olive mixture that I didn't know were olives until I tasted it. Not a big fan of olives but the bread was soft. All in all, I was pretty underwhelmed and probably wouldn't go back. If I did, I'd maybe try the enchiladas that my friend had. Hers looked good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance is amazing. Great vibe. Good food. Nice overall. Like it a lot. The green Pozole was good, my Mexican mom approved. Chicken en mole was good. Chilaquiles with red mole sauce was very delicious. Not one plate that we ordered was bad."}
{"text":"The people were very friendly I'm not a fan of Mexican food but this food was very delicious and I definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican ever!!! Nothing is bad! Guacamole with pomegranate is on point! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Creative cuisine. Over priced. Snarky server. Lovely space. Good vibe. Marg was ok. Not as good as the old days. Expected fish tacos to be better but will try again as I will go back but in no hurry."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT, if somewhat pricey, Mexican restaurant. Entrees are in the $15-$20 range, and appetizers are around $10. But the food is fantastic. The complimentary bread and tomato/olive tapenade is great. I ordered the Enchiladas Hongos En Trufa: mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, cream sauce, some zucchini and pico on top. It was great (and huge!). I'm vegetarian, and it was one of only a few things on the menu I could eat, but it was good enough that I'd go back, despite the lack of veggie variety.  I also had two house margaritas, which were great. Strong lime flavor, not too sweet. The waitress told me that the more premium margaritas are better because the lime juice is fresh, but these were good enough that I didn't want to upgrade.  The decor is rustic trendy. Not too fancy, but clearly decorated with care. Nice old wooden tables, leather and iron chairs, everything a little uneven in places. It's a great place."}
{"text":"This a small but good restaurant.  I enjoy coming here to have brunch with my friends.  When you get there on Sunday between 10 - 2 you are greeted by live music at the front of the restaurant and confining atmosphere.  So when you arrive expect to be sitting close to someone you don't know.  The wall are decorated by local artists that are trying to sell their work.  Once the waiter comes to your table he does his normal thing and then a small dish of salsa and basket of bread arrives so you and your friends can eat a little something while you wait.  The food is good but pricy, when you take your first bite every taste bud will be stimulated and you just want to take another bite to get that same rush.  I have only been to this restaurant for brunch so I am not sure what the dinner service is like.  During brunch it can take some time to be seated and get your order so don't go here expecting to get in and get out.  Sit back enjoy the music and have a good time with your friends.  I felt the wait was worth it."}
{"text":"So here's the deal..... Having tried Barrio at several catered events already, I had been meaning to try this place in person. Then we finally made it there when my brother was in town recently. The food was generally excellent all around (including the famous guac), but I felt like it belonged in a resort setting or something of the sort. Very accessible menu, pleasant service, and fun space.... but I would personally prefer getting the same styled cuisine from somewhere without the white table cloth, without the loud musician, and at much lower prices. It just seemed strange to me in some way that I can't quite identify. So I guess I'll keep bringing out of town guests, but otherwise stick with my favorite hole-in-the-wall places for the most part. Does that make sense?"}
{"text":"I came in about a week ago and had some of the best mole I have had in about a decade. Thank you for great food!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. The good part: they have an extensive variety of tequilas, the bar is good at making drinks and the ambience and decoration are both really cool. The guacamole and the cajeta crepes were both delicious. The guacamole I thought was very unique, using pomegranate seeds as an ingredient. The tamarind duck and the torta de puerco were ok. The bad: The food is not as authentic as I was expecting or the flavor was not as good. I am talking specifically about the chiles en nogada and the fish tacos. The fish tacos' filling was good but the tortillas didn't look authentic. The ugly: the queso fundido. That is totally not a mexican queso fundido. I don't know what cheese they used but the color and the flavor was totally different."}
{"text":"Wow- what a fabulous authentic cuisine we had last night. While visiting the Phoenix and Scottsdale area we happened to get a recommendation for this restaurant. When we pulled up around back (in the parking lot) we were welcomed with a wall of beautiful murals- the colors were so vivid and the art work was so alive. Our group started off with some fresh made guacamole- and I mean fresh. The waiter came out with a cart, sliced and diced and prepared it at our table. I ordered the sangria. It came out in a huge glass- didn't have to order a second. Thought it was a little tart but the sugar around the rim was a nice touch to sweeten the pallet. For dinner, of course I had to ask our waiter for his opinion between a couple of dishes. He immediately said the: Cochinita Pibil and so that's what I got. It's a 12 hour slow roasted pork served with grilled veggies, tortillas, and Yucateca. The portion side of pork was amazing. I even surprised myself by finishing it all- but it was that good.  Unfortunately, there was no room for desert.  I will make this place my local stop when visiting in the future."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Barrio Cafe for a few years now, but had never made it down to try for myself. I seriously question my life choices that I had not been graced with that food earlier in my life.  We ordered Queso Fundido to start. I am somewhat of a queso fundido expert, ordering it every chance I get, but let me tell you, this one blew all the other ones I've had out of the water! The sauce was creamy and smooth, the additional ingredients were thoughtful and full of flavor; the chorizo added the perfect compliment of earthiness and savory to cut through some of the richness. Superb. I'd go back just for that. My partner got the Enchiladas Suizas, which I've also had at numerous places (being quite a popular dish in Tucson, where I'm from) and again; these were in a class of their own. The tomatillo cream sauce was heavenly, the grilled chicken's char was a lovely addition. Delicious I ordered the Pollo Poblano. I didn't know what to expect but man; I have no words. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the poblano sauce has the right amount of heat and sweet, the veggies were cooked perfectly (a bit soft, like my Nana would make), the potatoes had a crispy edge and the rest smooth and buttery. Perfection.  I've eaten a lot in my years here in Phoenix, and lord does it show; but I will say that, without a shadow of a doubt, this was the best food I've had in the area. A bit pricey, but so worth it."}
{"text":"My go to mexican cafe. The food is authentic and extremely well prepared. Cafe is small but service is good."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice, awesome Cuban duo playing live music!  I had chile en nogada, which was a sweet dish full of so much flavor, loved it! The side dish was the reason I gave this place 4 stars. If I'm going to pay $24 for my plate, I expect the mashed potatoes to not be dry and flavorless, as well as the squash to at least be warm, which it wasn't. The guacamole made table side was very tasty and a fun experience. The churros with cajeta were fabulous."}
{"text":"I hate to give low ratings to anyone cause it seems rude. I honestly want to do a one star rating just on the food alone. The outside looked really nice. We went a Saturday night so once inside it was very packed. We only had to wait fifteen minutes even though the hostess said thirty to thirty-five. Out of the four of us, two of us weren't impressed with the menu. I was willing to give it a try. Live music was playing loudly and I didn't mind, some of my party did. Our waiter was attentive for the first half of our service. Very busy night. The moment he mentioned they don't serve rice or beans, the disappointment went up. I'm just like.. are you serious? But I got fries as a side to my tacos. Three tiny tacos with so so carne asada with toppings and a small plate of fries and it was $13. No. One of the other members of my party, their plate was $32. The atmosphere is nice despite the hipsters which should have served a warning to me for the food. Same goes for the bread at the table. My first thought was, \"where are the chips\"? Overpriced for mediocre tasting food. Needless to say we all agreed we wouldn't be back. PS The queso fundido is the only thing that was really good."}
{"text":"I love trying local hot spots around the Valley and found this one to be a great treat...although a little scary from the outside. Beforehand, I read about the owner and how she wanted to stay true to her roots by keeping the restaurant in the area it is rather than moving to Scottsdale or somewhere similar where this gourmet restaurant would fit right in. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is so quaint and cute. My husband loves Mexican food, but was a little upset when they put pomegranate seeds in the guacamole. After one bite though, he quickly changed his mind. It was the best guac he said he'd ever had. The rest of the food was just as superb! My only complaint is the long wait to be seated, but what can you expect with such a great place!?"}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting better, but was sadly disappointed.   First of all, the parking suks. Walking into Barrio Cafe, I was afraid I would get stolen and never see the light of day again. Luckily, I made it to the restaurant.   The acoustics inside are terrible. We had a really loud party sitting next to us and I could barely hear the person sitting next to me.   The bread and olive dish they serve complimentary was OK. Nothing great, nothing to write home about. The bread was actually a little hard.   Our server was very friendly, but again hard to hear. We asked him what he recommend and based on his recommendations, we ordered the famous, table-side prepared guacamole, enchiladas de hongos (mushroom enchiladas) and torta de chochinta pibil (pulled pork torta).   The guacamole was fantastic! Very cool to watch it being prepared right in front of you too.   Our entrees arrived and they were both very bland. I've had more flavorful mushroom enchiladas at Z'Tejas. We debated on even taking our leftovers home since we didn't even care for them all that much.   Well, we decided to order dessert since we hardly ate our entrees. We went with the churros and ice cream. They were very good. Drizzled with carmel....delish!   So basically, the guacamole was good and the dessert was good. Skip the entree. Walk with a friend to your car so you don't get snatched. And be prepared to say, \"what?\" all night to your dining partner."}
{"text":"I'm basing my reviews on my personal preference for Mexican Food-Yes, I'm one of those people who want rice and beans. Sue me.  This is really lovely ambiance-we took some friends who were visiting from Tucson. I honestly hadn't looked up a menu, we went based on yelp reviews. It was jam packed crowded-I loved, LOVED the live band. It was fantastic!!! Our server was neither friendly nor rude, just felt rushed. The prices seemed inflated to me, but the food had lovely presentation. I had the fish in the banana leaf which was very good, and the guacamole was tasty, with the bits of fruit in it. Very unique. My husband really loved it, so I'm sure we'll go back at some point, but it's really not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Hmm, this is the first expensive mexican restaurant I've eaten at.  The downloadable menu online doesn't list prices, so I was a bit surprised at the restaurant.  Two entrees, guacamole and tip checked out to $60.    The food was good.  As every other review mentions the olive tapenade was a tasty surprise.  Addictive actually.  Entrees were the pipian verde and fish taco platters.  I adored the presentation.  The plates looked appetizing (quite the opposite of platters at other mexican restaurants where refried beans, cheese, and sauce are spilled all over like vomit and diar...you get the picture).    Not so sure why everyone is raving about the guacamole.  The extra ingredients just made it too crunchy and overly tangy.  Yuck!  Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Worthy of the hype in every way imaginable. Our server, Dick, was a true professional and took our dining experience to a new level.  The table side guacamole was excellent. I settled on the Pescado Veracruz and quite frankly it was as close to perfect as I could expect a meal to be. Yes it's a little pricey but the quality and creativity of the dishes justifies it."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch yesterday because we recently saw the triple D episode. Have to say, the food is amazing. Service was good and waiter was friendly. We tried the tacos, she had the fish and I had the pork. Both were phenomenal. When we are in the area we will put this on our rotation of Phoenix food choices!"}
{"text":"An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again.   However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.    We were seated immediately.   Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).   Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.   When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.   Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Not cheap for Mexican food but definitely worth the price.  The location is eclectic and if you're expecting something common you will be surprised.  Good menu and their treatment of traditional dishes is delicious.  Absolutely a must try if you're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My excitement about eating here was dampened a bit the moment we walked in the door and it was too cold in the restaurant.  Anyway, I let that go, and we ordered our food, fresh guacamole, and shrimp tacos.   Before our food came, we were served a basket of bread with an olive topping on the side.  Now, this should have been amazing: it wasn't.  The bread was somewhat stale, and chewy--and not in a good way. The olive garnish was nearly flavorless. Okay, on to the main course.  The good: The salad that came with the tacos was very good, with nice greens, dried fruits, and a flavorful vinager-based dressing.  And the guacamole--although overpriced at $12.--was quite fresh and nice, and the inclusion of pomegranate seeds was a nice surprise.  The bad:  The shrimp tacos were simply awful. The tortillas were rubbery and weird tasting, and the heavily breaded shrimp were mushy, and the breading was undercooked, and not crispy at all. Any food truck taco would have killed the Barrio Cafe tacos we had.  If you want great Mexican food, that is fresh and well prepared, I highly recommend La Santisima.  It is an amazing place, with a brilliant menu, and a great atmosphere.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Always incredible. Small place so usually a await. By far the best enchiladas I've had in my entire life."}
{"text":"The staff was rude and unfriendly.  The music was so loud that no conversations were heard!  The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Guacamole; pricey but very fresh with a different texture and unique mix of ingredients.  Fish tacos fresh and not heavily battered. Pork tacos were also very good. Side salad also very good.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was superb, service was by far the most terrible experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The waiter dumped the food on our table and never checked on us throughout the night. He gave us no common courtesy for a restaurant that's supposed to be refined dining. We complained to the manager who didn't make us feel like our complaint was important. I got stared down by the waiter on my way out after I said thank you when we made eye contact then lost his cool when I went up to him to ask why he stared me down. He called me bro when he was justifying his behavior, I'm 23 and he was at least in his late 30s. He had a problem with my table the entire time. The food did come out very cold. Go for the food but pray you don't get him as a server."}
{"text":"Expensive, mediocre  When we sat down they brought out stale french bread with tapenade which felt like an odd choice for a Mexican restaurant. I ordered the shrimp salad with spicy vinaigrette for $16. It was literally 3 shrimp(!!) and around it was slices of brownish avocado and mango. That was it. The \"spicy\" vinaigrette tasted like store bought balsamic and I was as hungry when I left as when I arrived. My husband ordered pork torta, their house speciality. It was bland and forgettable. Don't understand the hype about this place."}
{"text":"Great service. No wait time. Great food. We ordered French press coffee, agua de límon, suizas enchiladas, and torta cochinita píbil. Everything delicious. I wouldn't call it typical Mexican but you definitely see the deep rooted authentic inspiration."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant.  I have lived in Phoenix since 1985 but had not heard of this place until recently.  This restaurant did the catering at the Desert Botanical Garden for Via De Los Muertos and that is where I descovered their cuisine.   Decided to celebrate my b'day here and it was a great choice.  Had been trying for several months to have dinner there but they were always closed on  the one night we were available to go out.  Finally!!!   There was about a 40 minute wait for a table as they were packed.  Normally I will not wait more than 10 minutes anywhere for a table.  While waiting decided to have a guava margarita at their bar.  great tasing drink.  tV ery tiny, maybe 6 seats total.  Understand they have bought the place next door and will be expanding which is exactly what they need.    We both decided on their house specialty of the roast pork.  great choice.  Very large pile of deliciously cooked pork was surrounded by mashed potatoes and zucchini.  It is enough for at least 2 meals.  I will go back for more but next time find out when they are not as crowded. We were there on at Sat just before 8pm so possibly a few hours earlier or even later. Very reasonably priced for the food."}
{"text":"Superb! I don't have anything to add any of the other reviews other than to encourage you to get to Barrio Cafe as quickly as you can. It's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. All the great reviews, I've had many people tell me to go there, and to top it all off the chef was nominated for a James beard award this year. I have been in this industry for a long time and know what an honor it is to even be nominated for this prestigious award.  I'll start with the good... our busser was awesome and if I wasn't in corporate dining now I would of done everything I could to poach him from this wretched place. Also the limes that came with my taco were really juicy and some of the best I've ever had. But I guess  we have mother nature to thank for that not this place. Yes I just added that the limes were good in this review if that tells you anything.   Now I don't really know where to begin from here but here it goes... how in the actual fuck can you call this place authentic Mexican food. Taco bell is more authentic than this sad excuse of a restaurant. No beans? No rice? No chips and salsa? Really?!? Bread and olive tepanade?!? Yes you read that right ladies and gentalmen.   Tacos served with FRENCH FRIES?!? The pork was dry and seriously lacked flavor I don't know how you fuck up braised pork but they sure seemed to figure it out. The tortillas fucking blew. And it was all slopped on The fucking plate with sauce finger prints all over The rim of The plate. Have some fucking pride in your job and wipe the rim of the plate before you send it out you lazy asses. The enchiladas suizas were the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It looked like a bowl of Alfredo. Dry cubes of chicken breast, some shit poor white sauce wrapped up in the poorest excuse for tortillas I have ever seen mounded with cheese and looked like the shoved that shit in the microwave. Served with a side of zucchini topped with a sprinkle of corn. (The corn made it mexican...) and all for the grand old price of $19 and fucking $12 for chips and guac... Are you serious right now. What did President Enrique Pena nieto grow and pick those mother fuckers him damn self. I really think this is place is disrespectful to Mexican culture and cuisine. It really worries me that this is the chefs interpretation of Mexican food and that this is what she was nominated for in this year's James beard awards. This is  Sad! Just sad! Needless to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up.   Food: Really glad I ordered the cochinita pibil entree. The cochinita was really well cooked and still moist, though not served (and maybe not prepared) in banana leaf. Served as make-your-own-tacos. Friend ordered carne asada tacos, which seemed fine.   Drink: Small full bar with a medium-sized beer menu.   Service: Table service was very attentive. Problem was with the door staff, which told us the wait was \"25 minutes or less\" and turned out to be a full hour. People weren't sat in the order they arrived. Despite having a good number of staff around, they just weren't turning tables over; empty tables would sit unbussed for 15 minutes. We waited on their little patio, which was fine enough, except the staff kept coming out onto the patio, staring vacantly at the street, and then engaging each other in really animated conversations about nothing. The whole thing was a bit weird.   Ambiance: Crowded and a little bit noisy, but not unenjoyable.   Bottom line: They've reached some level of fame on the back of their good food. Staff just needs to keep it real. Recommend going, but not waiting if there's a long line."}
{"text":"This was definitely an out-of-the-typical-Mexican-food-box experience! The food was really high quality, and the service was excellent! One of our party thought her dish had too much pepper, and the waiter was apologetic, sent the food right back, and it was quickly remade and brought back. They definitely want to serve their guests and give them the best experience possible!"}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe has been on my list of PHX foodie places to try and I'm so glad I finally tried it. I had friends visiting and as Mexican food lovers, I felt that Barrio was a great choice. The wait was pretty long, about 40 mins, but we expected this for a Friday night dinner.   We got the Queso Fundido (yummy!!), Camaron Tacos, Poblana Torta, and a steak/pork chop dish that my friend swears is the best steak she's ever had and one of those that will 'haunt [her] forever' until she comes back and tries it again (her words, not mine). We waited quite a bit for the food, but it was so worth it. This isn't your typical Phoenix Mexican restaurant where the entrees are crowded with the traditional Mexican rice and beans. Barrio has a more unique twist to it, and although a bit pricy, I definitely see how it's garnered its awesome national reputation.   The restaurant is pretty small, and parking can be scarce. There is street parking on both sides of the restaurant, but it was still easy to manage. One of my favorite parts would have to be the murals ALL AROUND the restaurant. In the parking lot, on the side walls, etc."}
{"text":"This is our post children's hospital meal tradition! Love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Barrio Cafe two weeks ago....(am I the last one? There are like 300 reviews of this place?! sheesh)  The neighborhood is ghetto-fabulous, but arriving while it was still daylight comforted me a little.  The food was just as good as I expected! (Thanks, yelpers!)  The guac is to-die-for.  Pomegranate seeds and chunks of avocado....ah-mazing.  I ordered the non-alcoholic \"Mexican Water\" I believe is what it's called.  It is a mix of fresh lime juice and seltzer water in a long neck glass rimmed with salt.  Very refreshing!  Favorite dishes:  the steak with crab dish, the avocado salad (though it is only avocado, shrimp and mango..no lettuce.)  And, the chicken with apricots, nuts, etc.  Delicioso!"}
{"text":"hubs and I were staying in a resort for a few days vacay in AZ when we started craving for mexican food. glad we found this place.  first: parking at the back of the restaurant  was small so beware. place is dark but otherwise clean.  we ordered margarita and they were good.  we initially ordered pina colada but they don't have em. had the guacamole-prepared table side which was pretty good and catchy. their flan for dessert was definitely good. had the mole-- also good.  service, food and drinks were great!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal I've had in the valley, period. The pork in banana leaf, the guacamole, the salsa, the elote and the burritos were all incredible. We enjoyed the live music and the staff was very helpful in creating something suitable for picky little kid eaters. I'm sad it will be another year until I'm back in AZ and back to Barrio Cafe!"}
{"text":"I don't know exactly what to say about this place. I hated it - I know that for sure. I just can't put words together as to why.   I wasn't impressed with the guac - so what if some emo guy with horn rimmed glasses stabs at some avocados and other diced veggies with a spoon for 30 seconds? Is that supposed to make me piss myself with excitement? Anyway, it tasted pretty bland... and for $10.50, I think it should taste better. The chips that came with it were a little greasy, but okay.   Our entrees were about 15 bucks each and I almost laughed when they arrived... four tiny pathetic lukewarm soft tacos alone on a cold plate. It looked like something I could've bought on a street corner in Rocky Point for 2 bucks. We had the option of getting salads or fries with our tacos... FRIES. How is that Mexican? We had the salads which were okay...   They only had corn tortillas which I personally don't like. I had carne asada and my girlfriend had shrimp... the beef was pretty good - and the shrimp was okay. The cheese they put on our tacos was kinda gross. Neither of us were really impressed.   On top of that, the place was pretty loud... I guess it's understandable for a small crowded space. Maybe they could've used some acoustic panels or something. My table almost tipped over on me - I just never felt comfortable there at all. I actually felt so uncomfortable I forgot what stuff was - like I had to ask him to clarify what carne asada was (something I order and eat all the time). I just got all confused after looking through their menu. The server was fake nice to us, but I felt hated... we only saw him at the beginning and end of our meal... we kinda got ignored on the drink refills - I think it's cuz we weren't ordering booze (which they make a fortune on).  As food goes, this place is edible, but not good. It's nowhere near worth these prices. It's comparable to the Pink Taco, but slightly less douchey perhaps? Neither place is very authentic (or good). I asked what on the menu was spicy and he said 'nothing.\" They also only have one dish with rice - ONLY ONE - and it's just a special because they normally don't have any dishes with rice. What the hell is that?   I sometimes wonder why people like places like this... it's as though they just like it because the place is crowded and the food is expensive. It's just bland food. Overrated. Overpriced. This place can suck it - I won't be back."}
{"text":"i think the $$ is a bit misleading. entrees average $20. i would price this restaurant at $$$.  crusty fresh bread with green olive tapenade instead of chips n salsa. tapenade was delicious.  salad with fresh spring mix, pico & dried cranberries with light, tasty balsamic dressing. careful of rather LARGE pieces of jalapeño in the pico! but the pico is served in a small \"pile\" on one side of the bowl, so add as you wish. otherwise a tasty mix.   pork tacos were awesome! tender tasty marinated pork, tangy sauce, not too spicy. if you want more heat, add tomatillo salsa. (oh! and watch out for same large jalapeño chunks in pico on tacos!) 3 to an order for $15  lots of tasty sounding choices of fresh fish of the day, steaks, chicken, tacos, tortas, enchiladas and specials of the house. fish & meats served with choice of sauces.   desserts looked and sounded wonderful, but i ate all my tacos! no room!  fresh aquas frescas and horchatas too - $5.50  one more note... im all for ambience... but i have trouble with eating in the dark. once the sun went down, my table near center of the room was DARK! i prefer enough light to see my plate.  service was good."}
{"text":"One of the best places to bring visiting guests. Go early as they do not  take reservations. Happy hour is 3-5 T-F with buck 50 tacos. Long story short....although the tableside guacamole is \"fun\", skip it so you have room for everything else, including the churro dessert. Portions are not enormous, but decent.This is not your Americanized Mexican restaurant. Everything is gourmet and fabulous, with attention to detail. I don't consider $20 for an amazing entree to be too expensive. We usually go here only for special occasions, or if we have out of town guests. I'm hoping we'll go once a week until I've had everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"McDowell 16th Street, great place its not far from my work at Bp Printing.  I love to go there for dinner.  Great atmosphere and they opened up a patio.  The guac is famous and made right at your table.  What a presentation.  I'm not going to back up the authenticity but the food here has a lot of heart."}
{"text":"Food:  We ordered  1. GU A C A M O L E   C A S E R O 2. C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L 3. T O R T A  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L 4.Q U E S O   F U N D I D O 5. P A S T E L  de  C H O C O L A T E  a la  O A X A C A  All this items were very basic without any interesting or complex flavor combinations except for the dessert.  The flavor and presentation of the food was unremarkable. I think we might have ordered the wrong stuff but there shouldn't be any wrong stuff at a good restaurant.  Also, they bring you bread instead of chips and salsa.  I don't mind the bread but it should be freshly baked bread at a James Beard nominated restaurant.  This was some store bought bread from Safeway or Fryes.  The guacamole  had cranberries not pomegranates as advertised.  It was fine but the whole guac show at the table is really unnecessary.  Plus, their show is lame.  They just mix the crap in a bowl in front of you.  They don't even have a mortal and pestle made of stone where they mash it up.  If you're going to go through the trouble of doing something like that, I want to see stoneware from an ancient mayan temple.  No theater whatsoever.  Service:  Our waiter looked like a cross between a pirate and a convict.  He had the vocal expressiveness of a mime.  When we asked about the food, he told us exactly what was written on the menu.  He was also irritated that we asked questions since it was clearly written on the menu. Corpses have more passion about what they do.    Decor/Ambiance/Location:  Overall, the decor and ambiance of the place is simple, comfortable, and unpretentious .  The tables are covered with tablecloths and the lighting is dimly light.  You can definitely bring a date with bad skin here. There was a good Mexican band playing live music.  The bathroom has more Crucifixes and Mother Mary iconography than an Italian grandmother's house.  The restaurant is located in a neighborhood that earns the designation \"barrio\".   I was pleasantly surprised that my hubcaps weren't missing when I returned and was happy that nobody stabbed me. I like an adventure but next time I want to put my life on the line I will be going to Beirut not Mexican food."}
{"text":"Artful, delicious and authentic-yet-innovative Mexican food. This place is a cultural and culinary force in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm from the sf bay area but born and raised in AZ. Just got back from a visit which included dinner here. My brother loves it. We had a great time and the server was delightful but. Can't count me in as a fan though. First, the prices are ridiculous, even by bay area standards. Entrees are $12-$28. Yes, the tableside guac was yummy but $10.75 for one avocado plus some fixings??? The waitress raved about the mole and I ordered the enchiladas mole. Their mole goes way too heavy on the chocolate-kind of a hershey's syrup on an enchilada effect. It was plenty of food with the side veggies but $18.00 for 2 enchiladas and some veggies?? Hmmm... The margarita on the rocks was delicious. with a $1.00 upgrade to a better tequila. Sorry Phoenix. This place is overrated."}
{"text":"Really nice food however it is very overpriced. $10 for guacamole is outrageous, even if it is prepared tableside.  The pollo mole is spicey with just the right amount of chocolate.  Service was nothing great, noticed the table next to us who had a different waitress got a lot more attention than our waiter gave us.  Would I go back again yes, but would like it much better if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"Just returned from the Bario, and it was not a pleasant experience for us. The atmosphere was great- but the menu was full of unfamiliar items, and when we finally decided on a couple of items, they weren't as we had expected them to be. Very mediocre food. The pricing was a bit high- we paid over $40 for two lunches without drinks... We didn't finish the food, and the waited seemed oblivious to that- didn't ask if we enjoyed the meals at all. We won't be back."}
{"text":"A fantastic Mexican inspired restaurant that will take you beyond taco's and enchiladas.  The drinks are fun and interesting including the Flor De Jamaica Margarita**** (Hibiscus flower reduction, Tesoro Silver Tequilla and Grand Mariner).   We started with the Kuali de Camaron and an appitizer of the Pork Taco's.  The Kuali de Cararon***** was an amazing five star appetizer which had layers of flavor.  The roasted jalapeño filled with queso de cabra y oaxaca was spicy and creamy.  The shrimp and avocado gave the dish that extra level of flavor and texture although I would have eaten just the cheese and cream filled jalapeño as is.  I ordered the pork tacos*** because I wanted to try the pork which is marinated in the achiote and sour orange and cooked in a banana leaf overnight.  I have tried this marinade myself and wanted to see if I got it right.  The pork was wonderful however I thought it was missing something like an avocado slice or a creamy cheese to balance it out.'  For my main course I enjoyed Chef Silvana's Iconic Dish, Chiles en Nogada*****.  This is a fire roasted poblano pepper filled with chopped chicken, apple, pear, dried apricot and pecans, in a delicate almond cream sauce.  Cilantro and pomegranate seeds complete the Mexican flag colors for final presentation.  This dish was different and very tasty.  I think the almond cream sauce and queso fresco is what made the dish for me.  My wife had the Pescado del Mar***.  The fish of the day was halibut however she didn't get to try most of it because she was full from the bounty of shrimp, scallops and sweet crab meat which it was covered in.  The halibut was a little dry as well.  The cream sauce and crab meat really store the show for this dish.  We didn't have space for desert.  Great decor here as well."}
{"text":"The guacamole was very good.  The posole was awesome.  My wife loved her enchiladas suisa (I thought they were too creamy and a little bland).  My pork tacos were good, but the pork was a little too dry.  Carnitas should be more moist.    Way overpriced.  Way."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Barrios Cafe today (12/1/16). Food was delicious, services was great, but over priced! Who are you kidding? This is not \"Mexican food\"!!! I'm a Hispanic American who has eaten Mexican Food in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Southern California,and throughout Mexico. I would not recommend this Cafe as a Mexican Food restaurant. Stop the false advertisement. My rating reflects that it is not Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I rarely come on here to leave a bad review, but this place was the worst. I was very disappointed in the service, and the food and prices didn't make the wait worth it. I could have gone down the street and got a burrito from Filiberto's for a quarter of the price and a quarter of the time."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out for a while but there was always a long line during peak times. However last night we went out a little early (5:30PM) and found that there was no line and plenty of tables. Make sure you park in the back and don't stop in front of the restaurant itself or you will block traffic on 16th Street. Plenty of parking in the back. Besides the back and sides of the building are covered in these beautiful murals. Definitely worth a few photos.   We walked in from the back door. The restaurant is really cute and homey. Very clean. There is a really cute little bar up in the front. Our server sat us. He had the most beautiful accent. I could have listened to him describe the specials all night. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients and how things were prepared. He was also very warm and friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job.   Instead of chips and salsa he brought out the most delicious bread along with an amazing olive spread. I loved it and I really am not a big fan of olives. It was that good. My friend loves olives and she was in heaven. We both stated to get excited about what was in store for us.    We started off with the signature \"Lowrider\" margarita as it was half off on happy hour. Normally it is $12 but we got them for only $6. At first we were startled at the regular price but after a few sips we found it a bargain as it was very strong and it was half-off due to happy hour. And very tasty. But if your driving you may only want to have one just to be safe. (NB Cafe Barrio is on major bus lines so public transit is always an option,)   I had the chicken enchiladas with brown mole sauce. The enchiladas were amazing. The mole sauce had hints of smoldering chocolate and was so tasty. I fell in love. The sizes were generous as well. The main dish was accompanied by these amazing mashed potatoes which were out of this world. The food was excellent. So good in fact that we didn't save any room for desert.  The only downside to this cafe is the price. It was a little on the pricey side with our bill coming out to a little over $60 for two people. However, for a special treat type place with a date Barrio Cafe can not be beat. The food was very fresh, very tasty and its not your usual Mexican menu. I really enjoyed my food and my time at Barrio Cafe and will happily go again."}
{"text":"They over-cooked the Halibut in the special. Four people in our party that had it, spent 2 days with GI problems. The guacamole was more like a salad, than a dip. Big chunks with no creamy goodness. The only redeeming quality was the waiter was very nice. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I planned to meet a friend here for lunch. The day before, I saw in the Arizona Republic that Barrio Cafe would be featured on the Cooking Channel's Taco Wars show. I watched and knew that I had to get the cochinita pibil.  First of all, Barrio Cafe has extraordinary murals on and around the building. It creates a fantastic atmosphere. Inside also had very vivid artwork. It's cozy and a little loud, but it's not too hard to hear people.  I was not thrilled by the complimentary bread and tapenade. The bread was okay, not noteworthy at all. The tapenade just didn't do anything for me. I would have much preferred the standard chips and salsa. This was the most disappointing aspect of my visit.  Both of us ordered the pork, and it was indeed as delicious as it looked on the TV show. It was messy--the little corn tortillas soaked through right away--but my fork and napkin did their jobs. The salad on the side was fresh, but not outstanding. I really liked the dried cranberries--they were plump and delicious.  For dessert, we shared the churros. Oh my. EPIC CHURROS, PEOPLE. Loosen your pants, grab your forks. Best churro I have ever had, no question. It's served with a massive scoop of vanilla ice cream and a slathering of cajeta (goat caramel). A cat could have a bath in this puddle of caramel goodness. It's probably a good thing I was in public and with a friend, or I probably would have  licked the platter clean.  I was afraid it would be a lot crazier because of the TV show coverage, but I think it was to our benefit to come on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant stayed busy the entire time but I never saw anyone need to wait for a table. The parking lot was small but there always seemed to be a few spaces open.  Overall, it's probably the freshest Mexican food I've had here in Phoenix, though not a life-changing experience. Maybe my expectations were a little too high. I would like to return here with my husband and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"The most delicious Mexican cuisine this side of the border. I have enjoyed several dishes and each has equally impressed me. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant and an alternative to the typical gringo Mexican restaurants all over Phoenix. I had the Horchata (traditional drink) and Cochinita Pibil (roasted pork). Bother were terrific. My only regret is that I couldn't try the guacamole as the size was just too big and was a but expensive to just taste and waste."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER!  . . . and MY HIBISCUS MARGARITA WAS SUPERB!   On a very crowded celebratory evening  . . . one where AZ finally did the right thing . . .we stopped in for a bite . . . food is so good and there was so much celebrating to do that we were not the only ones who needed our hunger satisfied. We sat in the bar and drank wonderfully potent margaritas and waited for a table to open up. Worth every minute of the wait. Our busy server was attentive, without being overpowering, and there was not one thing I'd change about that exquisite meal. Not one!  This chef has to be one of the tops in the country! I absolutely couldn't have been happier with my meal . . . and will I go back? In a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on our way out of Phoenix, after commenting how we'd spent the past week in Arizona and hadn't eaten any Mexican food.  I did a quick search on my IPhone and this place was the closest.  It was about a 45 minute wait when we got there at 6:30 on Friday night.  We had a house margarita while waiting, possibly one of the worst I've ever had, but then we were given another one for free, which I did drink so it wasn't undrinkable.  They give each table bread with a red pepper and olive tapenade, which I thought was amazing.  We had their guacamole--they make it table side and add pomegranate seeds, it was really good.    I had the slow roasted pork, the portion was really large and incredibly delicious.  My boyfriend had their seafood relleno, also really good especially if you like creamy seafood."}
{"text":"Worth every bit of it's reputation! Amazing lunch in a great atmosphere. Do not listen to reviews that are bad. Some people need to broaden their horizons and realize that not all Mexican food fits in the gringo box.  Thank you for being a gem in central Phoenix! Our first visit of many to come in the future."}
{"text":"Ventured to this place after seeing it featured on DDD. Always on the hunt for good eats, especially Mexican food. This place does not disappoint. Started with the queso fundido. It was so much more than just your typical queso, with a huge blend of flavors. Served with homemade chips, it was a great start to our meal. I had the mariscos enchiladas, and my husband had the cochinita pibil tacos. Both were very good. The enchiladas were amazing, with lots of cheese and seafood!   Great service and great food. Come visit this little gem!"}
{"text":"Um. Crazy freaking good food! You didn't know you needed pomegranate seeds in your guacamole until you've had it, but now....my life goal is to have pom seeds in any guac I make for as long as I'm breathing.  The drinks I tried were the Sergio el suave and the flor de Jamaica margarita. Both excellent and unique. The entree I had was the single best chicken dish I have ever ordered from any restaurant, anywhere. Pollo poblano. Despite this raving review of the entree, when I go back to this delightful hole in the wall, I won't order it again for the simple fact that I will want to try every delicious-sounding item on this menu, confident after this dish that I couldn't be disappointed. I could not have been more pleased with the meal. Ten stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely, the best guacamole ever -- I've lived in Phoenix over 45 years and consumed a great deal of Mexican food.  The pomegranates were a great addition!  My only criticism is there are not enough vegetarian options.  In the future, I'll stick with the guacamole and a side dish since the guacamole is super filling.  In fact, its so good I will get an order just for me so that I don't have to share.  The portion sizes of the entrees my husband and I ordered were huge!  We needed to take half of our meals home.  A word of caution, the menu is a bit pricey but well worth it.  BTW - the horchata was terrific, next time I will try the aqua frescas."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved there corn!!! Best I've had hands down as well as the chicken enchiladas!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine is a chef who travels the world eating at all the best restaurants. She said \"when you go to Phoenix you have to go to Barrio Cafe\". My wife and I did on our visit from California did and we're blown away. We didn't stray too far from the tried-and-true but everything was fantastic including the Cochinita Pibil which was sophisticated and flavorful and the beer batter fish tacos which were the best I've ever had. Also the service was great and we never lacked for attention by the enthusiastic staff."}
{"text":"My friends and I were starving and were craving Mexican Food. From outside we weren't sure if there was a restaurant there, but we went in it was the opposite.  The staff was so warm and welcoming. The menu looked very unique and delicious. TBH, I don't remember anymore what exactly I ordered or what my friends ordered, but all I remember is that everything was amazing! The food looked very modern unlike any Mexican food we had. The addition of pomegranate to some of the dishes was a surprise and delicious. I remember we had chips and guacamole and it was so good! It was fresh avocado with pomegranate. A must try.  If I'm back in Phoenix, I'll definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"Great fancy Mexican with some delicious desserts. Their Churros are something I still dream about."}
{"text":"At first I was thrown off guard with the bread and olive salsa. Barrio cafe had created its own version of chips and salsa. They completely substituted the expectation guest have when visiting a Mexican restaurant. Mixing in the Spanish version of an appetizer. It gave it a different feel. With the live guitarist playing in the back ground. He played Mexican ballads with an elegant feel. We enjoyed lunch in he middle of the afternoon. Quenching my thirst with Agua de Tamarindo. It was not too sweet or too bitter, it was just right. Next we enjoyed a salad that had a perfect balance of spices. We shared the Pozole Verde was perfection and I highly recommend this dish. Lastly we shared an order of Pescado Tacos. A perfect balance of crunchiness.  I recommend Barrio Cafe"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last two weeks, if that tells you how much I like it!!  It's a rather unassuming building facing 16th Street (save for the bright purple paint), but pulling into the back parking lot and seeing the colorful murals all over, I knew this place was something special and unique.  As we walked through to the front of the house, I took note of the local artists' works adorning the walls, as well as the Mexican pottery and other decor.  Very nice atmosphere, and I love to see businesses partner with local artists like this.  It gave me a great sense of pride for Phoenix to be in here, like this was our special gift to the world.  As soon as we sat down, we were presented with a basket of bread and some kind of tapenade (?)... in a Mexican restaurant?  My confusion was quickly quashed as soon as I tasted this delightful mixture.  A nice departure from the standard chips-n-salsa you get at other Mexican restaurants.  Since my dinner guest was from out of town (Calgary, AB!), I insisted we start with margaritas and some chips and guacamole, which was prepared table-side.  I was surprised to see our server put dried cranberries into the guacamole, but boy was it tasty!!!  And the homemade chips were outstanding as well.  We both enjoyed our margaritas as we noshed on the chips and guacamole, and bread and olive/pepper mixture.  We both ordered the Tacos de Conchinita Pibil, and the food arrived very fast.  Dios... Mio... Que... Delicioso!!  Soooo succulent, flavorful and delicious.  Phoenix definitely has no shortage of Mexican restaurants, and it surely has the edge on GOOD Mexican restaurants as well.  However, this place is something really special, and several steps above all the other Mexican restaurants out there.  This is where I will take my out-of-town guests from now on.  This is where I will go on special occasions and even not-so-special occasions.  I'd heard so many wonderful things about this place, and all I can say is, they're all right.  I could simply kick myself for not coming here sooner.  It's well worth the hype, and Chef Silvana is a Phoenix treasure!!"}
{"text":"Ok, 5 stars just for the guac. Chef Silvana has made such a different mix with adding pomegranate to her guacamole, it's worth the visit just for that. Everything we've had there is a different twist on traditional Mexican. One of the best mole we've ever had. Love the graffiti on the outside walls. This ones a keeper!"}
{"text":"First time visit and loved it. Solid Mexican beer menu, appetizers, and main course menu. The atmosphere is very welcoming if you are looking for a casual bite to eat, date night, or even a business dinner. I will certainly come back.   I went with the Torta del Barrio. Excellent tasting dish with the roasted poblano and Oaxaca cheese. The fries, almost like steak fries, as the side tasted great with the spicy ketchup. The complementary olive tapenade is a great starter. We also went with the table prepared guacamole."}
{"text":"So I was visiting family in AZ when a friend from LA recommended this spot.  The menu looked a little pricey, but the options all sounded fantastic.  The conchinita pibil was fabulous.  Three tacos stuffed with large chunks of succulent tender pork, perfectly marinated with just the right balance of sour orange.  We also tried the mole, which was rich in flavor, smooth, an exquisite blend of chocolate and chile.  I could drink shots of the mole negro...and did.  Aaron, was excellent, providing great service and adding to a wonderful culinary experience."}
{"text":"The tacos! Omg the tacos. Shrimp and Halibut tacos are amazing. Go on Tuesday-Friday from 3-5 and ask for happy hour menu to get tacos for $1.50 and you're mind will be blown. I have no idea how this place can be rated so low by others. I'd eat here everyday if I could, but that couldn't be healthy. Best tacos since I was in San Diego last year."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day and I was impressed. I guess I'm used to chain Mexican restaurants where the food is mediocre at best, so this was a pleasant surprise.   I've heard there is always a long wait, but it took only about 20 minutes to get seated.  The atmosphere is nice, but the prices were a little higher than I expected.  That being said, once I received my food, I wasn't bothered by the price anymore.  If you're a sangria fan, you're going to fall in love with this place. They have a fantastic sangria here, but be careful because it's also really strong."}
{"text":"I had heard so many wonderful reviews about this place I finally got to go with my Mexico City friend. We both loved it. We had to wait about an hour so just sat and had some Margaritas which were delicious. When we were seated it took them a really long time to get to our table but we finally ordered. The table side guacamole presentation was fantastic and the guac itself was delicious. I ordered the Pollo Pablano which I really liked but my friends Del Mar dish was incredible. I think this place has a wonderful history, a talented chef and the decor is fresh and artistic. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pulled in for a quick lunch take out. Ordered the pork tacos. $12. While I was waiting I knocked back a shot of tequila. $10. Tasty. The four street tacos were excellent."}
{"text":"First time at Barrio Cafe, and was not disappointed.   I've heard about this place since moving here last year, and now I've finally made it.   Initially you're greeted by an entire block of \"street art\", welcoming you to Calle 16.  Our waitress, Gabriella, was very friendly, making us feel at home.  The tableside guacamole was authentic, delicious, and sprinkled with their signature pomegranate seed.  YUM.   My wife ordered the Chiles en Nogada (chicken,fruit, and more in a stuffed poblano.  YUM.   I ordered De Mi Tata (filet mignon topped with crab meat in pomegranate reduction)  a huge portion, cooked to perfection.  YUM.  And for dessert we shared the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (you just got to try this!).  YUM.  Needless to say, we'll be back.  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I am probably wasting my time with this review, seeing as there are well over 100 reviews. But, I have to because I really wonder why all the hype. Yeah, the food is really good. But, the portions are small and really, really pricey. You get half as much as you would expect at twice the price. Not to mention they tout the chef and menu being inspired by her childhood in southern Mexico. So when I ordered my entree and the waitress asked me would I like fries or salad with it, needless to say I was more than a bit surprised. What? Did she grow up in Mexico having fries with her tacos?  The place is tiny and incredibly noisy. You don't have a conversation there, you have a shouting match. And it is full of forty and fifty-something urban and hip upper middle class. (Although, is there a middle class anymore?) Not that there is anything wrong with that, I think it just speaks to the the food, prices and atmosphere.There is barely enough room to navigate and the near misses between the staff and the customers are something to see. Again, the place is not bad. I would probably like it a lot more if it were a lot less expensive. But, I think the Barrio Cafe is more hype than anything else and I don't think they deliver."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food restaurant in town. Hands down. Don't skimp on the guac and make sure to get a margarita. The wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"Thrilled to be back in Phoenix for their tantalizing delicious Mexican food. Not your typical Sonoran (or Tex-Mex or Baja), be prepared for interior Mexican food. The dishes are delightful and the chef/staff accommodate vegans happily. Guacamole mixed table side with pomegranate seeds (and other mouth-watering choices) - simply amazing. Have totally failed to even remotely duplicate at home (sigh) and no longer live nearby. Lingered with a dear friend for hours and even though there was a wait for others at this point, we never felt rushed. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Ate here on a short business trip to Phoenix.  This restaurant is in a relatively poor part of town, but that doesn't stop them from charging Scottsdale prices. The door opens to a tiny bar, make a left onto the dining area to see the decor is cheap and dated.  All the diners were white, which gives one the feeling that all the Mexicans are somewhere else, eating better food and paying reasonable prices. Guacamole is over $12, it's the same as you can get anywhere else except the put a few pomegranate seeds. It was good.  I had the carne asada tacos which were fine but no different than you can get at any fast casual mexican place.  The service was fast and courteous.  It was unsettling to find barrio cafe at the airport right in my terminal,  and the prices were nearly the same.   The owners of this chain are building their wealth one over priced taco at a time.  Throwing in a few almonds and pomegranates into standard mexican fare and charging 50% more doesn't make you an innovator,  it makes you another greedy restauranteur who doesn't care to reinvest in their business.  No wonder the menus online don't list any prices.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had read so many articles about the creative styling of Mexican food. Took my mom and son for lunch and asked the waiter how the Conchinita Pibil was. He explained how the pork was slow roasted and delish. I got the sandwich and mom got the tacos.   Wow....must have been the least tasty thing I've ever had in my mouth. I swear to Buddha, the first thought that crossed my mind at first bite was Spam! But then I thought, hey I've had really good spam at Keilanis in San Diego.  Suffice to say, neither my mom or I finished the meal. I think I took 2 bites and was done.  Regarding my son's chicken: I asked if they could make some plain boiled chicken and no spices. When the plate came out the side of fries was coated with their signature spice. The waiter assured me it wasn't that hot. Helloooo, we're talking about a 4 yr old child! Even I ate the fries and my mouth was tingling.  We sent it back. By the time the new dish had arrived, my son was cranky and wanted to go home. Guess they can't rush a plain chicken and fries dish.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Dropped in after just getting into town in the middle of an afternoon.  No wait, seated promptly.   Started with guacamole.  It was, eh, not my thing.  It was sweet tasting thanks to some pomegranate seeds which they decided to include for some odd reason.  The guac was not prepared properly.  I get wanting nice chunks of avocado but this had the consistency of a fruit salad instead of a dip...wouldn't even stay on the stale chips.  All that said, I went with the carnitas tacos and they were absolutely AMAZING.  Each ingredient played so well with one another and the pork was cooked to perfection.  Truly one of the best tacos I've ever eaten.  Service was slow but friendly.  Margaritas were delicious and we caught happy hour (50% off drinks) which made them taste that much better!  Would definitely recommend Barrio but wouldn't recommend their version of guac."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my high expectations going into dinner that caused such a let down, but truly it was the lousy food and average service.    Our meal started with margaritas at the bar, which for $8 each, were made with well/plastic bottle/cheapo tequila.  Not even (gag) Cuervo.  Or Sauza.  This was bottom bottom shelf tequila.  Triple sec?  Yep, same plastic bottle variety.  The sour mix was good though, couldn't tell whether it was fresh lime but not sickening sweet.  But $8?  C'mon, that's just robbery.  Love the ambiance, and dig the chicano art vibe.  Servers were visibly not overly happy to be there, and I felt like there was the whole BS sales pitch on food/beverage. The whole \"Who's ready for margaritas?\" line doesn't work buddy.  Had I not gotten mine from the bar, I would easily been turned off to not want to order one.  We ordered our meal, and the server provided a olive tapenade that I enjoyed, but served with cold cut bread?  Ok, so forget serving the obligatory mexican-american chips, but c'mon, must be something more interesting to serve.  Bread was cold and borderline stale.    Our meals came, and I ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  For me, this dish needs to evoke feelings of eating home cooked food in a \"warm your whole body and give you an endorphin rush\" kind of way.  That was completely absent.  The pibil was served with 4 cold and dry corn tortillas (not homemade either) and was easily the saltiest thing I've ever eaten on a plate.  And for me, who is a salt lover, it was unbearable.  Maybe they can get away with serving such crummy pibil because people have never had good pibil?  I don't know.    Girlfriend's tilapia was good, as was my dad's mole negro enchiladas and my mom's pollo poblano.  Not 5 stars good, however.  The mole had too much chocolate for my liking as it was very sweet and had too much cinnamon.  The potato mash they served on the side was tasty.  Probably one of my favorite things about the meal.  My rant will end with this:  enough with chicken breast.  Yeah, I get it, trying to be \"upscale\", but for the love of Foster Farms, serve a whole leg with your mole.  Dark meat is delicious and for me should be served with your homey rich sauces.  Oh, and for the reviewer that said this was actually located in the barrio - go spend some time down in Guadalupe.  This is not the barrio.  At all."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant listed in the top 10, number 2, Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix. It was an article in ABC15's app. So, I was sort of in the area and decided to try it. Wow, I am so glad I did. If you're near downtown Phoenix you have to go. Great service and really great food."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, I've never had enchiladas that tasted this mouth watering good. Also the pomegranate in the guacamole is such a genius touch."}
{"text":"Food is so authentic and you can taste the love put into it. We had their enchiladas suizas and chile abogado both were amazing. Cutest little place. Neighborhood was an initial concern but once we were inside I was lost in ambiance, good food, good service and local artists artwork hanging on the walls. We loved this place and would absolutely come again"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever in an upscale way. It's not your typical Macayos type of restaurant it's on their own level of excellence. I love their pollo poblano, guacamole and desserts. Everything I have ate here is out of this world. Love the staff! My favorite waiter is Hugo. Everyone should come here at least once in their lifetime. Margaritas are mighty tasty here. By far my favorite restaurant for a couple of years now. FYI the name explains the location, it's irritating for snobby Scottsdale people or anyone to call this area GHETTO, it's ignorant for yelpers or anyone else to immediately judge. Chef Silvana kept it in the BARRIO/NEIGHBORHOOD of Phoenix to represent her culture and neighborhood. Read some reviews and it really irritates me to read the complaints on the \"ghetto\" location. But if you are \"scared\" of the \"GHETTO\" location I recommend going to their location inside the Phoenix International Airport where you will feel safe. I have been coming here for years at all hours and I have never had an issue but it's up to your discretion."}
{"text":"What can I say #tripleD delivers again. This traditional Mexican eatery was very good. Certainly worth visiting again.  The food is was really good. We had Carne Asada tacos which was was solid but we were really excited about the guacamole. Very fresh with a S. Mexico flare that had a surprise ingredient. I won't ruin it for you, try it yourself and let me know if you like it. I also had traditional Menudo with meat and hominy. It's a simple dish but executed perfectly.  The staff was very attentive and helpful. Even helped us find items not available on that day's menu.   The dinning area was  a well lit informal room with unique local art on the wall that can be purchased. The furnishings were comfortable and have it a nice sense of traditional Mexico with leather and steal chairs to go with a beautiful antique wooden bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I checked out your reviews on yelp and friends recommended I try your place.  When we got there on a Sunday at 2pm, the place was packed.  Well, I can say that it was well worth the wait.  The chips an guacamole with pomegranate was incredible to start, then I had the Carne Asada tacos with fries and that was just tasty.  Talking to other people, this is a place that you must try.  Will come back with family and friends."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place after hearing about how amazing it is for years. We started off ok, with good, unique sangria and fantastic horchata served in Mexican Coke bottles. 37 bucks (not including tip) for those 4 drinks, but they were good. 45 min was estimated wait for table. Stretched out into well over an hour (I didn't look at my watch so I'm not sure), but hostess was nice and apologetic, so I'm still ok. Then, the troubles start when we finally got to the table. Weird dry ciabatta bread with an ok tapenade to start. Esquites (a corn dish) for an appetizer was really yummy. Finally happier, briefly. I then ordered a beer, and that's the last we saw of our waitress for at least 20-30 minutes. No beer; no chance to order food. She then came back to get our order; had to ask for beer again. She was not charming at all, barely polite with a somewhat snooty, cold attitude. Another long wait for food. When it finally came, my fish was tragically overdone and dry with a side of uninspired zucchini. Hubby got the duck. Sauce was good, but the duck was so rare it was chewy. Daughter liked her black mole, but the rest of us thought it was too bitter. Other daughter's carne asada tacos were good, but the French fries on the side had a weird bland chile dust and no salt. I love potatoes in every form, and these were just plain awful. We're planning on dessert, but it was never offered and after another long wait for our check, we just wanted to get out of there. It wasn't just us either, another group that came in after us waited for their table for probably an hour (this is at 9:30pm) and finally left after being ignored while there were plenty of tables that had opened up. The 2nd star is only because of the horchata and corn, which were glimpses of what this place must have been to earn all the prior accolades. Seriously, Poca Cosa in Tucson has a similar style of food, but blows the doors off this place. No comparison."}
{"text":"This place almost single handedly rescues Phoenix from dinning-mediocrity.  It is by all means a ma-pa shop tucked away in a not so developed area of east-Phoenix.  If you are going south on 16th Street, it will be on your right hand side after Thomas Rd.  It's across the street from a strip mall and honestly there's not much else around.    Their small parking lot is in back of the restaurant.  But inside, fantastic Mexican food and a cornucopia of Tequilas await you.  Guacamole is made fresh table-side.  Tell them to go easy on the dried cranberries or raisins.  The menu has a long list of authentic Mexican dishes.  The mole sauce is very good but definitely try the fish tacos.   Prices are reasonable, be prepared to spend around $20-25 for dinner.  All in all, Barrio is a great experience."}
{"text":"So happy we stopped into Barrio!   The red sangria was good and we tried a few different small plates to share. We didn't go for the more typical things as we wanted to try something different. Our waiter was great at helping us make selections.   My only disappointment was that my meal was not very hot.   I had ordered the mole enchiladas and the mole was tasty but the enchiladas were not heated all the way through.    Live music was playing by the time we left - we will go a bit later next time so we can enjoy the music."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to the Barrio for many years. The food items seem 'different' at different times. (Guacamole is always different...chunky, smooth, raspberries, cranberries, pomegranate...). I have found that the filet topped with crab cake is probably one of the best in town. My husband loves the Mole here. The deserts have never wowed me, however, the tequila and margaritas are always strong and worthy! Bring your credit cards....its not cheap!"}
{"text":"We were in town this past weekend and had to stop by Barrio Cafe. We originally heard of this place through Diners, Drive-Ins' and Dives and we absolutely loved it. Hands Down to Chef Silvana and team!  It's not your typical Mexican joint and it's not your typical priced taco dish either. You definitely pay for what you get. If you're looking for quantity, you'll be disappointed.  At BC you'll be paying for creativity and quality. We totally dig it!   We all chose different choice of meat tacos and I tell you,  all five of us were super content.  (My steak tacos were perfectly cooked and tender). I don't like olives but as an appetizer they serve sourdough bread with an olive spread. My party thought it was delicious.   Not to mention the ambiance....super hip. They had a man playing solo on his guitar Gypsy Kings type music. That was super cool. Everyone was friendly and helpful.   P.S. Don't forget to read the history of the Cafe and Chef herself. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Random area. Must be a converted home back in the day in central Phoenix.  What I was impressed with was the table side guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. The waiter made some crazy concoction and the secret ingredient of pomegranate seeds added. Gives is texture and a sweetness to the guacamole. Absolutely genius.  The sangria was amazing as well. They serve it with a shot of Jack Daniels and it tastes like juice.  Finally the churros are soooooooo delicious. Who doesn't like fried lard sticks dipped in cinnamon and sugar filled with caramel?!!! Dude, move over Disneyland churros and Costco churros, this is your bling bling cousin!!!  My entree- some halibut, was lack luster. I didn't enjoy it as much as it was hyped up to be. Presentation of it looked like something that came out of a buffet line- messy and uninspired.  Tried a nibble of the famous 16 hour pork as well and I was underwhelmed.  In conclusion- come here for perhaps a snack? They were incredible."}
{"text":"I have gone to Barrio Cafe a few time because I keep wanting to feel differently about it. It is in Central Phoenix which is fine but it is difficult to find a place to park. The decor of this place is my favorite they have so much beautiful art from local artists everywhere. I even love their slogan but alas \"Comida Chingona\" it is not. The first time I went I had the \"Enchiladas de Mole\" but really 18$ for four small Enchiladas the second time I had  the Mango, Tomate & Camaron salad that was also ok but 14$ for 6 shrimp. We also ordered the \"Guacamole Casero\"  they make it at your table but it was poorly made and then they added dried cranberries I still don't know why they do that. One of my friends ordered the \"Cochinita Pibil\" that was also just ok. I think the idea and decor are awesome but the food is just really not worth the price. I would be OK with paying good money for Great food but this is just not the place for that.  My table was full of people from Mexico City and Guadalajara Mex needless to say this did not fill the craving we had for fine Mexican dinning. The place is small and a little loud but I don't mind that at all, it was the food that really disapointed. So I will get my Comida Chingona elsewhere because Barrio Cafe sadly did not have it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to finally trying Barrio Cafe after having it bookmarked for months.   I have to start off by saying that I was so surprised at how pricey the food was. However, I thought maybe the taste would compensate for the steep price. That was not the case. $15 for a plate of 3 tacos with only a salad OR fries? No rice or beans? Please, get over your expensive prices. The amount of food is not worth the money. The Cameron and pork tacos were not bad, but I could get 2-3 dozen of similar tasting tacos for the $30 I paid at another Mexican restaurant or taco stand.  The horchata was good, almost as good as the horchata I would drink in Mexico but also 4 times the price. $5.50 a bottle lol  I'm Mexican and grew up eating Mexican food, so I know the food here is good. But it is not $15-$20 a plate good. I'm still baffled at how people are willing to pay so much for average Mexican food.   2 plates of tacos and 1 horchata was $35. We left feeling hungry and sad that they would charge so much for a little amount of food.   I went to La Sintisima (5 stars) down the street last week and the cost of 4 people's meals was $55 in total AND we had to take a lot of food home because the portions were big. The food tasted better too."}
{"text":"Good Stuff, this is what Mexican food dreams about!!  Took  my folks in for late lunch one day, hit it right on time as we were seated right away and then the line formed.  The best: the guacamole, made at your table with pomagranites...  The really really good: pescado Delmar..outstanding shrimp, crab fish all cooked perfectly.  The only down side is once you treat your self to this outstanding meal, the bill comes and it is a little pricy.  Will we be back...yes its worth it"}
{"text":"Chorizo and eggs is one of my favorite dishes to order.  At Barrio the eggs were rubbery, the chorizo was overcooked, and lacked any kind of flavor.  This is a hard feat considering that chorizo is usually packed with spices and flavor.  When I eat my chorizo and eggs I like to have the option of tortillas not a piece of burnt toast with \"gourmet\" spread on it.  The one positive aspect of this establishment is the yummy mango mimosa.  The drink was a perfect balance of mango and champagne.  The mimosa is the reason why this review has two stars.    Gourmet Mexican food does not mean serving tasteless chorizo and eggs.  Gourmet Mexican food does not mean charging an average of $20 a plate.  This is certainly not the best gourmet Mexican food.  One of the best places to have \"gourmet\" Mexican food would be in Chicago.  Enough said."}
{"text":"The four Jolly Diners slipped into The Barrio Cafe just as it was getting busy for the evening. It was recently rated as the best Mexican restaurant in the Nation and we really wanted to see why. First, the waiter made fresh guacamole right at our table which was served with chips. Fresh bread and tapenade were also served. Both were delicious. For entrees: I ordered the Posole Verde which had pork in it. I missed that on the menu so immediately removed that and it became meatless. My aunt had the Esquites (Buttered roasted corn kernels topped with chipotle cream). Sister ordered Tecate beer battered fish tacos, and mom had roasted corn chowder. It was all well prepared and delicious. It was easy to see that the dishes at The Barrio Cafe are unique and delicious. It is certainly not the typical Mexican restaurant experience. The Jolly Diners revommend The Barrio for anyone wanting a truly above average and uniquely delicious Mexican cuisine experience.I now really do understand why it was rated as the best in the nation."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Great food and great atmosphere!  We had lunch and everything was excellent great service vice and food!  The bar area would be a fun place to hang out in the evenings!!"}
{"text":"On my last day in Phoenix, I found this treasure.  I'd been disappointed all week by Mexican food no better (and in some cases, much worse - see Los Sombreros!) than I can get at home in Boston.  I'm usually skeptical of places that win \"Best of\" awards from magazines with city names because I know how easily those \"judges\" can be swayed.  I'm happy to report that in this case, the judges are right and the long string of  \"Best Mexican Restaurant\" awards that Barrio Cafe has won from Phoenix Magazine is well deserved.   My friends didn't want to meet for brunch, but I really wanted to try this place so I headed out by myself on Sunday at 11:30.  The restaurant is small, and my preferred solo seating - the bar - wasn't available (it only has 2 seats, anyway) because it was being stocked by the bartender and isn't usually open for brunch.  I was seated at a table for 2 and was impressed the genuine feel of the surroundings and the genuine attentiveness of my waiter.  The walls are filled with artwork by local artists, all of which is for sale.  The restaurant is very small and the tables are close together, so if you have a large group, you'll feel a bit confined, but it's well worth it.    I started with a la Picocita margarita and some guacamole.  The marg was awesome - it's Chinaco silver tequila infused with chile de arbol pepper, the glass is dusted with chile powder and the drink is served with a pepper and a lime.  Not the traditional margarita taste, but it was fantastic - the right margarita for brunch the way a Bloody Mary often works as a brunch drink.    The guacamole was among the best I've ever had.  I am a guac fiend, and this was just fantastic.  I didn't expect the sprinkling of pomegranate seeds, but they really added to it.  The chips were fresh & firm enough to manage a good dipping without breakage.  Although it's supposed to serve 2, I ate the entire dish & could have licked the bowl.    For an entree, I went off of the brunch menu because the brunch offerings were pretty mainstream.  Unlike many other restaurants, while Barrio has a brunch menu, you're not limited to it.  The entire menu is available.  I selected the Chiles en Nogada - a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots and finished with an almond sauce and pomegranates.  It's only available when pomegranates are in season because the chef feels they add so much to the dish.  The chef is right, and the dish was absolutely out of this world both visually and gastronomically.   There is a lot going on with this dish, but the flavors combined beautifully and the pepper was perfectly roasted.    I shouldn't have, but I was so impressed at this point that I moved on to dessert and coffee (I didn't eat again until almost 9:00).  For dessert I chose the Churros, a fairly common dish, but I'd never had them before stuffed with goats milk caramel and served with vanilla bean ice cream.  What a treat!  And the coffee?  I like my coffee black and rich.  Theirs was so good that I bought a bag of beans to bring home to Boston with me.   So what wasn't perfect?  Well, at brunch, they have live music.  The guitarist was excellent, but DOES NOT NEED TO BE AMPLIFIED in a room that small.  And there is the fact that the room is very small.  At a 2-top against the wall, I was protected from the distractions that diners at a central table will experience.  If it were possible to award 4 1/2 stars, I would do so for those two reasons, but it isn't, and with Barrio Cafe's food, there is no way I'm cutting it down to only 4 stars.   Thank you, Barrio Cafe, for proving to me that it is worth going to the southwest to get excellent southwestern and Mexican cuisine.  Until brunch on Sunday, I was grotesquely underwhelmed with what Phoenix & Scottsdale had to offer on that front."}
{"text":"It was my first meal at Barrio although I have lived here years and have heard repeatedly that it was great.  I loved the guacamole they make right at your table, with lime and black beans...so yummy! The only drawback is the wait to get in on a busy night. Plan on waiting, and there is not alot of bar space, so you are outdoors in the heat on 16th street. Not the best waiting atmosphere, but worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Fantastic find! The shrimp quesadilla was spectacular, best I've ever had! Shrimp were perfectly cooked and savory. Staff was friendly and helpful, my server Cesar was attentive and gave thoughtful food advice.   Only problem is since I don't live in Phoenix I won't get to eat there often   PS: thanks to Yelpers for pointing me in the direction of this place!"}
{"text":"I read about Barrio Cafe in an issue of Bon Appetit.  It sounded amazing and I had to try it.  A good friend with a shared love for innovative Mexican food also said it was a must try so I must tried it!  The lobster quesadilla was orgasmic...no other word for it.  I love garlic and I love lobster so it was an easy sell.  For my meal I had the mole enchiladas.  I love mole (have even made it) and you can taste the time and love that goes into Barrio Cafe's mole.  The guava margarita completed the experience and it was so good I'm ashamed to say I didn't try any others.  Next time!  The only reason I gave this four stars is because of the wait...it sucks if you get there at the wrong time."}
{"text":"Not your average mom-and-pop mexican restaurant. Think of traditional options with an upscale twist and other more uncommon options that are just as delicious. They serve a soft bread with olive tapenade as a complimentary appetizer (much like you would receive chips & salsa at a traditional establishment). It was a tasty, uncommon start to our meal.  For appetizers we had the tableside guac - yum! The pomegranite seeds added a nice crunchy pop to the softer texture. Thinking it could have used some fresh minced garlic, but it was great without it too. We also had the Elote - an upscale version of Mexican Street Corn. It was on the sweeter side, but the spice from chipotle or ancho cream helped balance that about a bit.   Husband had oven baked seafood enchiladas - tasty blue corn, a few different kinds of cheeses that packed a big cheesy punch (almost too cheesy for him, but not for me!) All topped with seafood. I chose a signature dish - Chiles en Nogada. It was savory and quite sweet all at the same time. the nuts and chicken in the stuffed mixture added a nice texture to the sweet/mushy fruits. If you really like sweet and savory dishes this is a good one (more on the sweet side than savory). Something fun and unique than what you find traditionally.  It's a small space so if you dine there on a busy weekend be prepared to wait. It is on the pricier side (I guess, depending on what you order). But a Sunday night dinner for 2 will run you about $80 or so."}
{"text":"200+ tequilas, one of the only places for cochinita pibil, and amazing tableside guacamole with pomegranate seeds.   This restaurant is amazing. Don't go here if you are one of those schmucks looking for a chimichanga with rice and beans all topped with red sauce and cheese. This is real Mexican food, not some American creation that the bible belt thinks is Mexican. I've actually heard people say this place doesn't serve Mexican food, where are the enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. Go to school!  I've eaten cochinita pibil just about everywhere that serves it, and I've made it on my own. This place does it WELL! The atmosphere is interesting and fun, but the place can get really really really busy.  Go early and enjoy, and sunday brunch is great as well with live music."}
{"text":"Had good service and better food this time. Way better experience than last. Improvement"}
{"text":"Maybe I had too high of expectations. Maybe I ordered the wrong items. But the food was just alright, and the price didn't help, considering I could have gotten a highly-satisfying $5 burrito next door but instead paid $40 here.   We ordered the guacamole and the Suizas and Verde enchiladas. The addition of pomegranate seeds to the guacamole was an interesting touch. I thought it would add too much sweetness, but instead it balanced out the tartness of the lime juice. Which, the guacamole just tasted like lime juice and avocados and pomegranate seeds to balance out the lime juice. Nothing else special.   The Suizas enchiladas, like some other reviewers pointed out, just tasted like cream (milk) and cheese. The chicken breast was somewhat dry and bland. Nothing exciting here either.   The Verde enchiladas had a decent verde sauce. Also nothing exciting.   Service mishaps: We sat at the bar and waited over an hour for a table (which they informed us ahead of time). However, even though they had checked we were there midway, they still managed to skip us so we waited at least an extra 30 minutes. They said they called us, but mind you, we were seated right next to the hostess stand so there was no way we missed it.  Also, I ordered the esquites appetizer and chorizo for my enchiladas but they never came... and the server didn't even check up on us once.   Food: 2.5 stars, rounded down to 2 due to service.   Better luck next time?"}
{"text":"What a great experience!!  While producing a conference in Phoenix, I wanted to take the staff out for a great time at a restaurant and with food that we can't get in Detroit.  In my research, I found Barrio Café, and so glad I did.  I called ahead days before and were told THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS.  And they are NOT kidding about that, so be prepared to wait. It's a small, yet very popular place, but worth the wait.  While we were waiting, we ordered chips, salsa, and guacamole.  All three were great, but the guacamole with pomegranate seeds was phenomenal!  Living 3/4 of the way across the country, I am definitely going to try to recreate it at home.  Once we got our table (there were 7 of us and we had to wait for 2 side by side tables to clear out), our service was friendly and efficient.  They served fresh white bread with an olive tapenade.  Several of us had read up on Chef Silvana, and were excited to try her creations.  I ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  Reminiscent of my family's North Carolina Appalachian pulled pork, it had a Mexican flare that was unique and delicious.  It was even served with a thin \"dip\" rather than a thick bbq style sauce.  Outstanding.  Another of our crew ordered the Chiles en Nogada and we traded bites.  It was also outstanding. Fruity and flavorful.   After dinner, we took a group photo in front of the artwork on the side of the building.  I will definitely go back if I have the opportunity.  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"The 411:  -tiny place with live music on the Friday night we went -long wait (45min for a party of 2 on a friday night) but worth it -absolutely love the pom guac- ridiculously delicious (my fav) -legit tacos   Would definitely go back even with the long wait- next time I will order drinks at the bar while I wait"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Really great and friendly service. Bummer part was I wanted to try the pork torta and they neglected to tell me to after I had already chosen it. I got the poblano torta and it was really good. I also loved the lime water. Best stuff."}
{"text":"Holy Mole!   It's been about 4 years since I first experienced Barrio Cafe and although much time has past they still know how to rock the mole!   I started talking about Barrio Cafe with a friend a few weeks ago and last night we were finally able to make it meet for dinner.   I've read some of the previous concerns with the wait staff and can honestly say that we had nothing but superior service.  Our waiter (sorry do not remember his name!) was super attentive and although the place was buzzing (especially for a Wednesday night!) was very pleasant and extremely informative.  The rest of the staff was also right on it! Drink refills were timely, etc. All were very attentive but definitely not intrustive!  The bread and tapenade were very good... great flavors for sure!  We saw several people ordering the table side guacamole and decided to start off the meal with that!  A-MAZE-ZING! Made to your taste with fresh ingredients... in fact my friend, who does not like anything spicy preferred to skip the fresh chopped jalepenos.. the waiter asked if I would like a spoonful separately on a plate.  Very impressed in his thoughtfulness to accomodate both of us!  Hands down the best was the dried cranberries in the guacamole... Who would have thunk such a simple addition could put this over the top?!? (btw... the waiter did share that they you fresh pomegranite in place of the cranberries when the are in season) Can't wait to try making this at home!  For the entree's I had the Pollo en Mole... Folks... this is how mole is meant to be!  This is a deep black Oaxacan mole with complex flavors that meld together in your mouth for a blissful experience... perfectly cooked chicken...served with a side of wonderfully cooked vegtables and mashed potatoes...  wonderful!   My friend order one of the specials of the night... Don't quote me on the name but I believe it was Pescado a la Veracruzana.   Huge... and I mean HUGE seared halibut steak cooked in a wonderful wine sauce and topped with olives, capers, tomatoes and fresh herbs... oh but that's not all!  It also included a lobster tail that was perfectly cooked with just enough garlic! And just in case that's not enough her's also came with the veggie's & potatoes...  After eating our fill and still asking for half the meal to be boxed up we decided that we would share and order of flan... Again perfection... too often flan is"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good tacos. I like the menu because it fuzes modern and traditional mexican dishes. The Barrio is a very cool location to meet friends at."}
{"text":"google a video for 'Receta de chiles en nogada tradición mexicana' on yelp, amazing"}
{"text":"Brought my parents here while they were in town from NM. We all loved the food, the staff is excellent and attentive, and my dad was so excited to meet Chef Silvana! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A friend from work recommended this place to me as one of the \"TOP\" taco restaurants in the valley... so I decided to take my boyfriend here for a date.  First of all, parking is small. We had to park on the side street and walk up to the restaurant. Inside was really cute - there were Spanish/Skull like paintings. There was live music.. which was REALLY loud. We had to wait for about 25 minutes for a table, but meanwhile we grabbed a drink at the bar. Now the drinks are pricey, but the Chata was absolutely delicoious! It was horchata and kahlua. Andy had a frozen mango margarita.. which was also pretty good. AND there goes $28 on drinks.  After a while, we were taken back to our table... our waiter HUGO was not so welcoming. I asked for a water and didn't get it until dinner was served. We did order the guacamole which was very good especially with the pomegranate seeds. The chips and salsa were tasty, but the bread was cold which was eh. We then order our food.. I got the Suizas enchiladas with the longaniza chorizo and Andy ordered Chile tacos (make sure to ask for your salad or fries that it comes with). Our food came out and I had to ask for our water.. Hugo had forgot. I then remembered that the tacos are supposed to come with a side. So I asked and out waiter said,\"No, just the tacos.\" As soon as we were done eating, which btw was very tasty (love the gilled chicken in the enchiladas), I asked for a menu so we can take a look at \"desserts.\" I really wanted to see if the tacos came with that side .... and sure enough, IT DOES! I was so upset. We told Hugo we were ok and ready for the check.. not to mention he never came to check on us or ask us how the food was. As soon as we paid, he took the check book without saying thank you or anything! We walk out and the manager, Julio, kindly smiles and says goodbye, but I make sure to tell him about our experience there. Great food, horrible service. He apologized and offered us a free dinner on our next visit. I guess we'll go back but only because we get a free dinner. Cute little spot but Hugo sucks.   You expect quality customer service for the price you pay.. that's the only complaint I really had."}
{"text":"What can I add to 145 reviews? Not much other than being 146.  For purists wanting true Mexican food, this isn't the place. If you're looking for something a little outside the box with Mexican roots Barrio is for you.  My partner and I went on Sunday afternoon. It was rainy and a great day for a drive to Phoenix to try something new. We were both pleasantly surprised. We only had a 5 minute wait for a table, but were asked several times if we had been greeted and reassured more than once that they'd have a table right away for us.  We both ordered tacos, one shrimp and one pork. The shrimp tacos were the best, the pork could have used a little more flavor.  All in all a darn good experience, although Barrio is a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Definitely not real Mexican.  More of a fusion food with Mexican dishes.  A salad with cranberries?  A basket of bread (good quality though) with olive tapenade?  A shame, i had such high expectations! I had the pork tacos and they were ok, a bit too salty and the tortilla either isn't homemade or has been sitting in plastic for quite some time.  My wife had a chili poblano dish with chicken and a massive wheat roll. I mean, come on, a french style sandwich roll?  She hated her dish, scraped the chicken and barely made it through the filling.  We left plates full of bread and the waiter said nothing, but he did give us his card for his personal art sales, a good touch to finish off the night."}
{"text":"Full review blogged.  High points below:  A native of a small town in the Midwest surrounded by farms heavily populated by Latino workers each summer of my youth I'm a bit ashamed to admit that overall my experience with \"Mexican\" food in general has been quite abysmal.  Sure there were childhood experiences with Little Mexico in Detroit before or after games at Joe Louis Arena and yes I've visited a few of Rick Bayless' spots in the Second City but beyond that and Border Grill in Los Angeles the closest I've been to South of the Border cuisine is Don Pablos...or perhaps Chi-Chi's before they filed for bankruptcy.  With these glaring omissions in my culinary education admitted and in part due to my overall lack of enthusiasm for spicy foods I promised myself going into this trip to Arizona that I would make an effort to at least hit some of the more upscale spots in order to \"ease myself in\" and the first of these stops would be at The Barrio Café.  Going light on the bread as it was somewhat uninspiring and the plates coming from the kitchen were surprisingly large it would be around twenty minutes after seating that my \"appetizer\" would arrive in the form of Tacos de Cochinita Pibil, four Mayan style slow roasted suckling pig tacos wrapped in house made tortillas with a side of Yucca fries, chipotle ketchup, and salsa Yucateca.  Beginning first with the tacos I'll simply say that while it may not mean much considering my lack of experience these were without a doubt the best tacos I have ever had.  Double wrapped due to the moistness of the succulent meat each bite was savory and smoky with a light acidity kissing the tongue as the queso fresco tamed everything.  Deftly spiced with any number of flavors foreign to my palate and going back and forth with the tasty fries I think the thing that really stood out to me with this dish was that while the \"heat\" was there, it served a purpose - pushing forward more unique tones like cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, and even sweetness from the meat.  For my main course; a dish titled Pato en Tamarindo or \"Seared breast of duck in a striking sweet & sour tamarind & chipotle pepper sauce.\"  With my love of duck well documented and already quite impressed with the flavor profile of the preceding tacos I have to say I went into this dish with high expectations and was met only half-way.  Beginning first with the accoutrements - mashed yucca with poblano peppers and asparagus with onions, both were tasty and well prepared if not particularly memorable.  Moving on to the duck, similarly well prepared with the breast first pounded thin and then sautéed prior to a final sear, the issue with this dish would flash back to my complaint about \"spice\" because while the menu said \"duck\" my palate merely said \"protein\" as the flavors of the fowl were entirely obliterated by the thick notes of smoke, pepper, and slight bitters.  A good dish, sure, but for someone who truly loves duck I simply wanted to be able to taste it.  With the duck now consumed and feeling reasonably full but certainly not \"stuffed\" Esequiel again stopped by with a big smile stating \"Nice job, I knew you could do it.  But did you save room for dessert?\" - an obvious 'yes' which led to perhaps Barrio Café's most famous dish arriving at my table just ten minutes later.  Entitled \"Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra\" and trumping either of the previous dishes in overall mass this marvelous plate was composed of essentially five things and all five of them things I love; deep fried cinnamon doughnuts, chocolate, caramel, strawberries, and ice cream.  Beginning first with the Churros - flawless, light, and crisp on the exterior with molten goats milk caramel spilling forth as they were cut...in all honestly they could have stopped here and I'd have been happy, but instead opting to pair this with an enormous double scoop of fresh vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with more caramel, slightly peppery \"Mexican hot chocolate\" and fresh strawberries...sure it was $12 for churros, but it is $12 I'd gladly spend again as I ate every last bite of the crunchy yet creamy concoction and spent another three or four minutes scraping the plate clean with my spoon.  With Esequiel returning yet again and asking, jokingly, if I'd enjoyed the churros he inquired (I hope jokingly) if there was anything else he could get me and telling him no, that the bill, I waited for a few moments while my tab was calculated - an admittedly pricey $58 after tax and tip - and with the bill paid I thanked the my servers for such a great afternoon before making my way back out into the sun.  Thankful for the meal that just was for opening my eyes in to a cuisine I've far too long overlooked I've no doubt that Barrio Café is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Valley's Mexican scene, but considering what they say about first impression's I'm glad Chef Esparza and her team made a good one."}
{"text":"I'm from Long Beach, California and we chose this place because Guy Fieri reviewed it on his show as one of the places worth trying in Phoenix.   I loved the vibe, the artwork by local artists Angel Diaz on the walls and the murals outside!   We went on a Sunday and had their chilaquiles con mole special. The chilaquiles came with two eggs and sautéed potatoes with poblano, as well as a side of Pico de Gallo. It was amazing, almost as good as my grandma's"}
{"text":"I am Mexican and didn't like the food but the guacamole and the elote were good I think that was the only thing that I liked, the service was really good though."}
{"text":"1 appetizer + 2 entrees + 1 dessert + 0 cocktails = $80  i don't mind paying $80, even more, for stellar food, but this experience left a lot to be desired. i had the casa especial, the chiles en nogada, basically a big, burnt poblano pepper stuffed with hunks of chicken and other organic matter. my friend had the suiza enchiladas sin carne, which really wasn't a good vegetarian option on his part. it turned out to be a messy, creamy disaster in a dish. the crepes with goat-milk caramel sauce were definitely the highlight of our dinner. and i will say our server was good. prompt and no BS. i like that. he didn't try to butter us up: hang around our table and try to make small talk. nothing worse than a waiter who won't shut the hell up and bring the food.  since i'm not from phoenix, i can't offer another alternative, however, if you're a vegetarian/vegan, this is not your place. very limited meatless options. then again, you could always stuff your face with the pre-meal bread and tapenade (in lieu of chips and salsa ... apparently that's too obvious for the barrio cafe). if you're looking for typical mexican fare, you won't find it here. but if you're looking for an aesthetically cool place to grab some dinner, give it a whirl. just be prepared to drop some cash to see and be seen in this hood-inspired eatery. personally, i think you could do a little research and get much better (and cheaper) mexican food in this area."}
{"text":"I felt like I was actually in Mexico when I ate here.  The restaurant is not located in the best part of town which may deter some people but once you're inside, you forget about the exterior.  When you walk in, there is a bar stocked full of different tequila, and luchador paintings hang on the wall.  Local art is displayed throughout the rest of the restaurant and is available for purchase.  The food is not your typical rice and tacos.  It has an interesting twist.  I ordered the \"pollo poblano\".  It was some of the best chicken I have ever had.  The food is a little pricey (around $20-$25 an entree) but it is definitely worth at least one visit.    Also, do not forget to take a trip to the bathroom! It's pretty interesting..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ------ We came here with a few friends for a lazy Sunday brunch.   Food  Someone in our group got the guac with pomegranate seeds, while we split an order of the fish tacos. We substituted the steak fries for a salad.  Guac - pretty tasty. The pomegranate seeds added a unique, slightly tart taste to the dish.  Fish taco - four mini tacos, each soft corn tortilla filled with a nicely fried piece of fish fillet (tastes like cod), cabbage, and creamy chipotle sauce.  Coffee - came in a French press, which allowed for slow steeping and extra aroma. Definite bonus points.   Ambiance  There is a guy playing live guitar during brunch. Not really our thing (we couldn't hear each other talking), but kinda cool I guess.   Other BE CAREFUL - they add an automatic 18.3% tip for parties of six or more."}
{"text":"Overpriced 'Mexican' food. This isn't authentic Mexican style food, just the chef's own Mexican concoction. The art work is nice to look at there."}
{"text":"Pretentious, expensive, small portions. We asked to sub lettuce for cabbage on the fish tacos and were told that they don't have lettuce; then one minute later they served us a lettuce salad. Nine tacos and water cost $42. Also saw the waitstaff treat the Caucasian customers more politely than the Hispanic customers."}
{"text":"Expensive, but OH so worth it!  Authentic Mexican food, let me rephrase that, GOURMET Mexican food.  Service is slow...my waitress was rude, but she was very nice to the table next to me. I don't know if it's because my husband and I look really young, and she figured the mature couple next to us would be a big tipper. It was weird, she did not make us feel welcome. We tried ordering their tacos, and was was VERY clear to impolitely tell us, \"today we have no happy hour\". Again, she was rude.  Cute spot, could be a little bigger for my taste. Definitely not for bigger parties of 4. It's a cute spot for a date night, or an intimate dinner.   Their queso fundido appetizer is everything! I am also a big fan of their enchiladas verdes, everything has great flavor, great attention to detail, great presentation.   I would go back, as long as I don't get the same waitress."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the Valley to eat and Barrio is my favorite place to take friends who come to visit.  The atmosphere, service, drinks and food are great.  The table side guacamole with the pomegranate is very good (we always try to duplicate it at home) and the cochinita pibil is unreal.  Park in the back of the building and check out the cool art that is painted on the building walls and fences along the alley."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is extremely friendly and the food is creative and fantastic."}
{"text":"Best Mexican (southwestern, spanish?) food in town.  No competition.  First, I'll adress some common complaints - yes, its in a rough neighborhood.  Could the best Mexican restaurant in Phx be located at Fashion Square or north Scottsdale?  Hell no.  As for parking, ever been to a large metropolis (Phx doesn't count)?  Finding parking is part of the adventure.  There is a wait - wouldn't you be worried if a place this small was half-full?  And yes, the Guacamole is basic, but that's exactly how its supposed to be - if a blender or food processor is involved, its not gonna be good.    The slow roasted pork is absolutely incredible.  The margarita's are great, and the wife and I even split an expensive shot of tequila (thanks to the big spenders at the next table over for the inspiration).  The Tilapia was also really good.  Finished the night with some amazing churros.    Great mix of incredible food and ecclectic location/decor."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Had Huevos de la Capital Two over-easy eggs topped with  spicy hollandaise sauce and  longaniza chorizo sausage.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The chorizo was delicious (wished there was more).  The potatoes that came with it were cold, however very good.  Came with a spicy grilled toast, very good.  Coffee is a large canister of French drip.  Very very good.  Service was delightful.  The murals outside adds unique character or mystic to the ambiance as you walk in.  Saturday they have a guitar player, that is good, but very loud.  Parking is tough but manageable.  Service was wonderful.  Our waitress was bright, cheerful and energetic!  Very clean.  You can taste the care in the food."}
{"text":"Wow! After landing in Phoenix, AZ I was incredibly un-impressed by the dry, plain, boring looking atmosphere. Honestly, it was a bit of a disappointment at first site...but, Phoenix might be one of those places that grows on you after a while. And, I think it's because of these unassuming gems like Barrio Cafe. I was so impressed by the professionalism, kindness, and knowledge of the staff. They know their food!   When it comes to food, let's just get to the best - Cochinita Pibil A.K.A. pork taco greatness! This juicy pork is slow roasted overnight and marinated in achiote and sour orange and you know what, even though it says that on the menu they really don't have to describe it. You can taste every spice in such a clear way. I can tell they take great care of every ingredient, and if anyone can get me to actually enjoy pickled onions they must be a genius. Yes, it's true...the chef at Barrio Cafe is a genius!  Other recommended items include:  Horchata (not your average Horchata either, this one's special) The Camaron - Shrimp Taco, was really good too  Listen, if you're in AZ this weekend because of the Superbowl or another sporting event, you'd really be doing yourself a disservice if you don't come by Barrio Cafe and give their food a try. You'll be really satisified with the truly authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is a great up-scale Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Phoenix!   Since 2002, Phoenicians (local Phoenix residents) and tourists have been flocking to Barrio Cafe to check out Wendy Gruber and Silvana S. Esparza's amazing concoctions! Cooking up authentic southern Mexican cuisine, Barrio Cafe is worth checking out if you are visiting Phoenix!  [devour] *BREAD & OLIVE TAPENADE (complimentary, **3 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#hotQFFC1GATHL5k4SK9RlA I love toasted bread and I found it interesting that there was a type of olive tapenade accompanied with this in a Mexican restaurant. I must say though, I like the concept, but I wasn't sure how it fits in with the Barrio Cafe theme and authenticity of Mexican cuisine. The olives were rich in sodium, so I needed to drink water to dilute the saltiness. Nonetheless, it was out-of-the-box, interesting, but nothing too memorable for me.  *GUACAMOLE CASERO & CHIPS ($10.50, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#MeFFk_MnYU7HeBUO3kpXYg I've fallen in love with their guacamole! I'm a guacamole slut and love everything about this dish! First and foremost, who puts pomegranate seeds in their guac?! They do! This gave a bit of sweetness, which complimented the acid from your typical guacamole ingredients. Prepared table side and made in a jiffy! I was impressed with this dish and would order it again!   *COCHINITA PIBIL ($19, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3TUF75Ror8SVevRy-CoaNA This dish is their FAMOUS 12-hour slow roasted pork marinated with achiote rojo (Mexican spices)! As you can imagine, the pork was quite succulent and there was a side of au jus in case you wanted more \"oomph\". The pork was topped off with salsa Yucateca, which elevated the flavors of the pork's richness! The dish was served with sauteed veggies and a sweet potato mash. It is a heavy dish to consume, but nonetheless, amazing dish that is taste-bud worthy! I can see why this is the popular dish amongst the visitors and regulars! Get it if you can!!! *oink*oink*    *CARNE ASADA TACOS ($14) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3NI_va9ekIdN_V8MzGYahw *FILETE AZUL (Filet Mignon) ($26) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#lsSphM27AH9f18-2r00T7A -I can't attest to the other two dishes since I did not try my fellow grubbers' dishes. But both were content with the dishes they had ordered that evening.   [imbibe] *HORCHATA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#wACvkrnyMEzHvYvvJh1iAA  Barrio Cafe was honored a couple years ago for having the most authentic horchata in town. As I had a glass of it (served in a glass Coke bottle), I was expecting the drink to be over-ly sugared! Surprisingly, it was quite tamed and it was refreshing to drink throughout my dinner here.   FYI = *No reservations - it's a first come, first serve kinda place (so expect to wait) *Closed on Mondays! *Parking on the street or nearby neighborhood lots *Nearby a random strip mall *Brunch served on Sundays only (11 AM - 3 PM) *HH Tuesdays - Fridays (3-5 PM) *They carry 250 types of TEQUILA!!!! *The restaurant's walls has plaques and awards for their food and service over the years! *If you love their food, you can find their 2nd location at PHX Sky Harbor Restaurant for their food to-go!    Service - our hostess was quite busy, she forgot to let us know how long we would have to wait to be seated. We didn't really have to wait too long (15 mins) and she apologized for the delay. Our waiter was quite attentive and was able to answer any of the questions we had about the menu. Our water glasses were filled promptly and although the restaurant was quite busy, they didn't forget anything we had requested! Thank you for your service!  Overall, I had a great experience with the Barrio Cafe and would recommend this place to someone if they are looking for an upscale kinda Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back for their guacamole, since they put a twist to the original dish!   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #25"}
{"text":"Delicious! Guac was great as was the soup and our meals. A bit on the pricey side though :)"}
{"text":"Yes. It's as great as the reviews say it is. Service was outstanding. Food was spectacular. Just order from the \"specials of the house\" and enjoy. We had the cochinita pibil, Chiles en Nogada, and the pato en Tamarindo. Each was outstanding. Unique and elegant. I wouldn't recommend a simple taco or quesdilla. That's too basic. Live a little!"}
{"text":"I had read such great reviews of Barrio Cafe, and was greatly looking forward to trying the cuisine. Chef Silvana had been awarded Best Chef in Phoenix by the New Times this past year, and Barrio had won multiple awards for its cuisine. I had high hopes and a little bit of fear of disappointment because of my expectations. The decor of the restaurant is colorful and welcoming. There is a huge mural of \"Phoenix\" out in the parking lot, local artists' work on the walls, and a unisex one stall bathroom with the largest collection of crucifixes I have seen that's not in a museum. Our waitress was very attentive and laid-back (she had glasses and a shaved haircut with a bun- I recommend her!), and we ordered the guacamole, the signature Chiles en Nogada and a seafood tostada. When the Chiles en Nogada came, I sliced a hefty forkful and dipped the savory pepper in its white sauce surrounded by pomegranate seeds. As I swallowed my bite, a rush of fresh flavors exploded in my mouth. In about 5 minutes, I had eaten the whole dish!! I was not even ashamed - I wish I had more, just writing this. What makes the Chiles en Nogada ridiculously good is the creativity and flair that goes into the dish. Not only this dish, but the other items at the table create an amazing tapestry of flavors that is a new twist to Mexican cuisine. I absolutely cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Although the Barrio Cafe is obviously a popular and cute little restaurant, I found myself mildly disappointed by the uneven quality.   The guacamole was a good starter -- chunky and made fresh at the table with lots of sweet pomegranate arils, it was unique and tasty. Nice chips too. Unfortunately my margarita was sub par -- clearly they didn't get the ingredients balanced properly. Both of our entrees were very good overall; I had the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and spicy mashed potato side, and my girlfriend had the Chiles en Nogada. However, while I loved the flavor of my enchiladas, some of the tortillas were noticeably dry. Finally, we had the churros with caramel sauce for desert, which was just OK due to the churros being overdone.  Overall, a 3.5, but I'm rounding down due to high expectations. I'd certainly give them another try, but they need to eliminate the rough edges next time."}
{"text":"My family stopped in here today for a late lunch (early dinner) after a fun day out at the Science Center. It has been at least a couple years since my husband and I had eaten at the Barrio Cafe, and this was my toddler's first time. She's a HUGE fan of guacamole, so we were really looking forward to the table side preparation but unfortunately it's only done at dinner time. Ok, minor disappointment, but not a big deal. What was disappointing was the guacamole itself. (Wish I hadn't forgotten my phone at home or thought to ask for my husband's so I could have taken a photo!)  For $11.25, you would think you would at least get the equivalent of one decent sized avocado, but that didn't happen. Nor did we even get what could be passed off as guacamole. It looked as though what avocado was there was was cut up, tossed into the bowl along with the other ingredients, topped with their signature pomegranate seeds and brought to the table! Don't get me wrong, I love a chunky guacamole but there wasn't one mashed piece of avocado in the bowl until we mixed it up ourselves. Then the first bite from my daughter elicited a \"NO!\" response, usually reserved for something like bell peppers or brussel sprouts. I tried a bite and could not believe how much lime was in it! Overkill would be a kind adjective.    For my meal I ordered the Tacos Pescado ($12.75) with a salad. The salad would have been a good simple one but unfortunately was overpowered by the amount of dressing on it and had mushy chopped tomatoes. There were three small (approx. 4\" white corn tortillas) tacos that were overflowing with cabbage. Each taco had 1 small piece of fish on them, that were cooked perfectly. Fish was tender and the beer batter was flavorful and crispy. Well... Crispy where it hadn't been drenched in what was only supposed to be a drizzle of Baja aioli. Unfortunately there was almost as much batter as there was fish! My daughter picked at a taco, chose to eat the fish, one of the tortillas and left the rest. The aioli had a bit of a bite to it but it tasted too much of mayonnaise to be considered good. I do have to say the tacos are filling with the double layer of tortillas. Completely overpriced for what I received.   My husband ordered the Tacos Cochinita ($12) with spicy fries. He didn't find it at all spectacular. It was good but not nearly as flavorful or enjoyable as in the past. Strange thing was the dish was accompanied by a side of BBQ sauce of all things! The fries had a slight bite to them but were over salted. The portion of meat on this was huge in comparison to what I received. Pricing and portion on this meal was closer to being on par with other specialty restaurants.  Our waiter, Hugo, was awful! The restaurant was not very busy (over half the tables empty). I assumed it was because of the odd hour we dropped in but even so, service by Hugo was lacking. My husband sat with an empty glass as Hugo walked by our table several times, empty handed half the time. My husband finally had to just stop him and ask for a refill. As I said before, the guacamole wasn't guacamole, and from what I understand the server is the one to mix this? And if not, isn't he at least supposed to make sure the item ordered is what he is serving? He never came by to check on us to see how our meal was so we opted to skip our other favorite here, dessert and their fresh pressed coffee. The bus person was super attentive, refilled waters when glasses weren't empty, cleared plates as soon as we were finished, impressive. Wish we could have tipped him instead of our waiter!  Also, as a side note for those of you with young children... they do have high chairs but no changing table and the bathroom was filthy. Floor was sticky, I don't even want to know with what and the garbage was overflowing. Kids meals were all $7 even just for a plain cheese quesadilla.   Had this been our first visit we would not have been impressed, but not nearly as disappointed as we were. Because we had had such great experiences previously this last visit was such a let down. Food just wasn't as good as it had been, service was nonexistent in comparison, prices went up and portions went down.   We hadn't been in the area much after having moved, but after having signed up for a membership at the Science Center we were hoping this restaurant would have become a weekly thing for us. Guess we'll keep searching."}
{"text":"I'm never in the area (or hood, as I like to call it), so when I was in the hood (or barrio, as I like to call it), I was well aware of the consequences of wasting the opportunity to hit the Barrio.  Driving past the front door, which faces 16th St, I concluded parking must be in the back... which there was... just none for me... so I settled on the questionable lot on the north side of Edgemont... you know, where they filmed The Warriors?  It's ok, I'm totes insured.  So, I fabricate my best hardened criminal scowl, gangsta-strolled up to the front door, lean like a cholo, and announce that I require accommodations for uno.  That's Mexican for solo.  The hostess looks me up and down, and that's when I remembered I was wearing my Disneyland Resort shirt with the adorable Mickey Mouse arm patch.  Son-of-a-nutcracker!  Luckily, I got the best seat in the house, right at the end of the bar by the entrance, where no less than 47 people came to order their drinks while waiting to be seated.  This is the first \"Mexican\" restaurant where I was served a sliced french loaf and tapenade.  I started out with the Esquites, which is a delectable myriad of buttered roasted corn, chipotle cream, cotija cheese with cilantro and lime, served in a petite martini glass.  YES, this is the way a civilized person enjoys elote.  For the main course, I decided on Chile Colorado, which is a grilled bone-in pork chop smothered in a dark chile and red wine reduction, paired with a spicy mashed potato and grilled zucchini (half of which were cooked perfectly)  Since I was in such a high-profile seat, I thought I'd treat the clientele to a big boy eating a massive dessert, with my very large plate of dos churros floating atop a lake of caramel near a glacier of vanilla bean ice cream.  It was a winter wonderland on my plate.  Four people could have comfortably split this, but I was there to give the performance of a lifetime, and somewhere during Act 3, I spoon-fed the last morsel into the black hole perched precariously above my chin.  In today's match-up... MAN WINS!  I love people, and my bar-stool accommodations allowed me to chat with a seemingly never-ending stream of patrons.  I was walking people through the menu, suggesting specific pre-dinner drinks (lowrider) and regaling them with my quips. My big hit of the evening seemed to be \"Wow, it appears y'all missed the happy hour pricing\".  That one killed them all... especially the young couple who was charged $27.23 for 2 Modelos and 2 lime flavored tequila shots.  Barrio Cafe is spendy.  The entree was overpriced, but the appetizer and dessert were well worth the fare.  Sure, my tab could have fed a village in Sri Lanka for a month, but I don't know anyone there."}
{"text":"Weird flavors.   Supremely over hyped.  I don't understand what people are reviewing when they leave all these 5 stars.  There is much better gourmet Mexican food to be had within a mile of this place.  Don't even get me started with how over priced this place is!"}
{"text":"Great food. Take a big apatite.  Flavor profile is awesome.  Right near  Children's hospital.  Service and staff were knowledgeable, friendly and great help.  Really great pork torta.  Fresh quality food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definately one of a kind. They're food is delicious and the quality is outstanding every time. The service is great. I always start my meal with the guacamole (my mom asked if it was made from guaca's). They make it fresh at your table at dinner time. The pomegranate adds a great taste to it. They also bring out bread with an olive garlic spread. That is absolutely amazing. I always order the Pollo Poblano. I can't even describe how tasty this is. The chicken is tender, the onions and pine nuts (i think thats what they are) mixed with the creamy sauce is very unique, and hits on every taste bud.This meal is not spicy to me at all. It comes with this white cheese that just tops the dish off perfectly. The deserts are amazing and so are the drinks. And if that's not enough, the art work in the area is great motivation to walk your meal off a little. I live in the west valley so I always come here for special occasions, and it is worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"It's a cute little place.  No, I mean it's a small little place with a bunch of tables packed next to each other.  Talk about being cramped.  I'm a small person but there's hardly any room to walk around the restaurant or between the tables.  The entrees we ha.  d were all good, don't get me wrong.  But they all taste the same.  All the entrees were overpowered with lime.  I totally believe in cooking with lime.  But I don't believe that everything should taste the same.  What's the point?  I'm sorry, this place is overrated."}
{"text":"The Barrio Cafe is a \"best of\" Phoenix. Oh my, that guacamole made at your table is fantastic.  Who knew that pomegranate could make it taste so good.  All the dishes - especially the slow roasted pork - are excellent.  We're never disappointed.  Great south of the border food right here in Arizona - highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went for HH...we have been to both the Gilbert and Sky Harbor locations but wanted to try the OG. Sadly, they are all pretty disappointing.  PROS The Chambord Horchata was very tasty Queso Fundido was very very cheesy and can easily be shared between 2-3 people  CONS Small space Our server could not be bothered to help us - the service was pretty atrocious. Example: ~10 min for someone to greet us, ~30 min for water, sitting in the corner in a super drafty area...  Since we have tried 3 Barrio locations and have not been wowwed at any of the locations, we will not be dining with them ever again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for unique, delicious, quality food... look no further! This place is a real gem! The food is so flavorful and different then anything I can compare it to. The only downside is the wait. Man oh man is it a wait. Not only for a table, but also the service. The staff are very nice, but it is a small restaurant with a lot of business.  If you go knowing this little fact and just sit back and enjoy the ambiance and delicious margaritas... your in good shape! As for food, I had the seafood enchiladas and all I can say is wow!!!! Also, get the guacamole! For dinner they make it fresh at your table."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Try the horchata-superb! Best time to go is on weekdays for no wait."}
{"text":"Finally made to to Barrio Cafe last night... really enjoyed it!   Our waiter was fun and exuberant and the place had a cozy atmosphere with great live music.   The food was excellent - we had great margaritas and tableside guacamole. Their braised pulled pork is delicious! My boyfriend had their special which was filet and lobster tail. Our dishes came with squash and mashed potatoes (chipotle-flavored, I think). All the sauces were oh-so-good.   Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Well there are a ton of reviews and I can't really say I disagree with many of them.  This place is loud, the parking is nightmarish, and it really doesn't have much of a vibe.  You sort of feel like you're sitting in some cheesy strip mall restaurant (which you sort of are).  All that being said, I ordered the special of the night - an 8oz Fillet Mignon (with potatoes, chorizo, and all sorts of goodness) & 10oz Lobster tail.  The dish was absolutely divine and one of the best things I've ever eaten in CenPho.  My only gripe was the guacamole.  What a big disappointment.  All the hype- the freshness, the tableside, the blah blah blah, the $15 price tag.  You'd think this was ambrosiamole.  Not good at all.  One freakin avacado!?  That's all I get?  And a bunch of pom seeds?!?  No thank you.  I'll take Ticoz guacammus any day over that mess."}
{"text":"Hmm The guacamole is delicious. The atmosphere was pleasant. Kind of noisy.  The food was fresh and fine but nothing to write home about, not considering all the hype that preceded my visit.   If they offered take out I would order to go but I don't feel the need to make a special trip across the valley for a meal. If I happen to be in the neighborhood and the wait isn't obscene then I would swing by for some appetizers and maybe a beer."}
{"text":"Scary things to me: Paris Hilton has a career.  Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant.  My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim! Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe.   Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, \"Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?\" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me.   Finally. I found it. And entered.   Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here. I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however.   I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it!   I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off.   Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!"}
{"text":"A nice, intimate restaurant tucked away. We were created by a friendly hostess, we put our name in for a table and while we waited we were able to enjoy a refreshing beverage from the bar. They had a large selection of tequila and a few specialty drinks. For our appetizer we had the table-side guacamole- they had a nice twist by adding in pomegranate seeds. I was hesitant, but I am now definitely a believer! I had the beer-battered shrimp tacos, an enormous shrimp on a corn tortilla  it was amazing and the flavor of the beer really pulled through and complimented the flavors. I ordered the spicy fries as opposed to a salad to go with it. The fries came with a chipotle ketchup and were amazing! My dad and husband stole them to finish off and that's all they could talk about all night."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today with Laura A. and had a good meal.  We got there right around 11am when they opened so there wasn't much of a crowd.  I wasn't hungry for the full entrees so I went with the tinga tacos which are one of my fav's.  They were pretty good and I couldn't finish all 4 of them with the fries so I would say for the price they were worth it.  I read many people say this place is over priced but if you look at the portions and quality of the meal I would say you are wrong.  If you want a cheap good meal then there are many places for that this is for a nice meal with lot's of flavor and variants over tradition.  As I was reading through the menu options I saw things that you can't get at most Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix but some things you can and yes they may be cheaper at other places.  So just plan ahead eat something special here and enjoy it.  This is one place I will sure be back to for dinner and some more of that yummy homemade horchata."}
{"text":"Honestly, pay me double what my meal cost me and I might consider eating here again.  2 hour wait for something that tasted like feet that had been in the Phoenix sun for weeks.  Never again."}
{"text":"Since I saw this restaurant in triple D by Guy Fieri I decided to end my last day in Az with this restaurant with my fam n omg I'm glad I choose this place ! It's not just Mexican food it's authentic Mexican food . Everything we had was so delicious. What attract me the most was the art. Everything to our waiters were so super nice and it was all a nice experience. I'll be back here next time I'm in Az ! For sure"}
{"text":"AMAZING Guacamole del Barrio is a signature dish and worth the trip in and of itself! The Guac is made table-side, ultra fresh and unique. Also highly recommend Esquites (small buttered and roasted corn dip) that was fantastic! Small, intimate atmosphere that is very enjoyable. Most of our party ordered a version of the Taco dishes and were quite pleased. I ordered the Pescado del Mar - absolutely fantastic! It's rich and filling, so I ended up sharing with table mates ... and they were thankful! Barrio Cafe is on my must return list, likely every time I'm in Phoenix. WOW."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this well-reviewed, Zagat rated dive that's been around seemingly forever.  Well, I don't get it.  The good: the people were very friendly. The horchata was fresh and very flavorful. The the chocolae Oaxaca dessert was pleasing though insanely priced at $12. The cochinita pibil has some interesting flavors.Well, the first one anyway. See below for this to make some sense.  The bad: The noise was insufferable. Sorry but the musical \"group\" for Saturday night has exactly 2 beats. It was just noise for a few minutes at a time followed by silence and then one of the guys saying \"thank you\" followed by a couple people applauding. The music, on top of a small dining room's non-existent acoustics made holding a conversation impossible. Many diners were leaning in to each other with one ear cupped. Others were plugging their ears.  The unfortunate: so there is simply no way that the food can be a total miss on a place this highly rated. My guess is that this was an off night. The pollo poblano was cooked so far into death that it took 2 of us comparing the chicken and the pork entrees to realize we'd been served each other's dishes. Poblano peppers? Well, there were none. The mashed potatoes just tasted odd. The waiter was very willing to switch out the incorrectly delivered dish for another of the cochinita. The second cochinita arrived in less than 2 minutes which was impressive - yet, the pork did not seem to have been marinated at all. The menu suggests an over-night marinade. Hmmm....  In my opinion: I'd rate the people and the server a 5 star experience. But, the ambience was something I couldn't deal with at all so a 1 star for that. The food was not up to what the reviews and ratings had suggested it would be. On balance, 2 stars.  One last comment (in case anyone with the establishment reads this): when we were leaving, an obviously way-too-drunk male patron was standing within inches of one of the female servers. She was practically pinned against the bar. His hand was pressed hard down against hers on the bar top. Clearly he was hitting on her. She seemed a bit scared but was also bravely trying to make the best of it. One male server stood nearby not getting involved. I was about to interject when the male floor manager made an appearance. So, I asked him if the server was OK. He said she was. So I left. But, I think it better to kick an out-of-line drunkard to the curb (well, get him a cab because he was really wasted) and risk losing that customer over allowing this behavior to happen to one of your staff. I do hope it all ended well."}
{"text":"Amazing. A must try in your lovely Phoenix!  If I had the money I would go right now. You're going to spend anywhere from 12 bucks or more for a plate."}
{"text":"This place from the onset has very cool \"Latino Mural Graffiti Art\" everywhere and it looks really nice and has a different vibe from your typical Mexican restaurant. Barrio is a sit-down place but neither a taco shack nor a cantina. They try i a little bit harder on their menu and don't try to fill you up on beans and rice. This means their dishes are more direct and have to provide flavor. Whomever created this menu has attempted to be a creative culinary artist by using your not so typical ingredients whilst giving the food that homemade feel to it. It was fun to try their take on guacamole, which had pomegranate in it. That was interesting, though, never again please. Some things just don't go. One of the members of my party actually uttered the words \"Ruined the Guac\" when describing it. LOL. I'm pretty sure we were content with our dishes, but that's not what left us bothered. It was the prices.  $15 for mediocre white wine $11 for a tiny margarita, perhaps even less tequila - quality of said tequila? $11 for the questionable and tiny bowl of Guac - can be eaten in 3 gulps $11 for Corn chowder with Spicy Shrimp - only 1 measly shrimp $9 for a beer -------------- That's already $60 not including dinner entrees!  It would be nice to be able to tell you that the food and service absolutely substantiated the cost, but it did not. Rather, you're just left wondering why you're over-paying for Mexican food that has minimal quality upgrade over the sub-par offerings of Mexican-style food that currently plague our society. Most people don't or will ever get to eat the decent better-than-average and better than the \"traditional\" kind of Mexican food that when prepared correctly, blows your mind and taste buds.   I say, if you want to try eating a different take on Mexican style fare and are willing to pay for it (and you will), then why not?! However, you could also probably get the best tacos you've ever had at a non-flashy hole-in-the-wall locale all the same. Agree or disagree, I'm just saying....and paying."}
{"text":"We found this place completely by chance on a rainy Sunday. Situated in a Strip of shops on 16th Street just south of Thomas, the neighborhood itself can make some want to put pedal to the metal and zoom straight through. But I am kind of the opposite. I love a few little places I have found around here including a little Mexican Snack/Ice Cream Shop just a few blocks south of Barrio. Any way back to Barrio. I really didn't know what to expect not having heard of it but the fresh paint and more modern exterior relative to the neighbors we thought, why not. WOW! We walk in to be surprised by a super busy Sunday Brunch crowd. With perfect timing we were seated within 10 minutes. The guitarist performing was superb, with a wonderful mix of spanish classical and modern favorites.  It was busy and rather crowded and our table rocked on the saltio tile floors. They offer varying menu but on this day we decided on the Sunday Brunch Menu. Several items ranging between $8-$14. I decided for the Calabasas dish and my friend, who couldn't decide between the huevos rancheros and the chorizo con huevos, on the suggestion of the server got the huevos with a side of chorizo. I ordered the horchata and he had the coffee.  The meal started with a complimentary basket of crusty french style bread with a mild yet flavor packed red pepper tapanade (a medley of olives, garlic and capers). Followed by our drinks. The coffee, served in a metal press, was very aromatic. My horchata, served in a glass Coca Cola bottle, was very sweet and more highly milk based and not as rice-y as I tend to like. It almost reminded me of egg nog with out the extent of the spices. While good, it was not what I was expecting.  The plates arrived. My friend raved about his huevos rancheros and said the chorizo was some of the best he has had, I had to agree it was fresh and not greasy. My plato de calabacitas was covered in cheese and the eggs hiding under that layer of cheese and squash. The calabacitas alone could have used some more salt but when combined with the tomato pico de gallo at the edge of the plate, perfect. The home fries were nicely prepared and flavorful. We left stuffed with no room for desert.  I will be back to enjoy yet another quality food find."}
{"text":"Guac hits the spot.  Servers are extremely friendly.  Ambience is cozy and check out the wall art on the back end of the building."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't eaten here until now!  I came last Friday night with Sarah H, her husband Dan H and another friend for dinner.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated.  The restaurant was completely packed so service was a little slow, but that happens everywhere on a Friday night.  I was really looking forward to the table side guac, but that was a big disappointment, fortunately our only one.  We had it with everything in it, but our waitress didn't mash up the avocado so it was more like a diced avocado salad than creamy guac, or even close to anything you could scoop up with a chip.  For dinner I had the Pescado del Mar.  A luscious piece of halibut topped with shrimp and scallops.  I could eat this every day.  For desert we tried the churros with goats milk caramel.  If no one was looking, I would have licked the plate.  I tried a bite of the flan and it wasn't so good - cold and flavorless.  I'm looking forward to a return trip and will order the same meal."}
{"text":"Had the chance to finally try Barrio Cafe and the food is excellent, the service is great... We had the Queso fundido as the appetizer, cochinita pibil and my friend had the chile en nogada. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is because their tamarindo had not flavor (great presentation) it was just simple syrup with color ."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food. Loved the atmosphere, live music, and art that was displayed."}
{"text":"Service sucked, our server only came to us once, we didn't get a refill until we were already ready to leave and asked for our check. food was meh, nothing we got was really anything out of the ordinary. way too hot in there, i don't think the ac was on at all. it was really loud, not really a place that you can really have a good convo. one thing was really good though; the horchata, omg best horchata i have ever had by far."}
{"text":"My first visit at Barrio Cafe went over very well and I can't wait to come back.  We got to Barrio at 12:30 on a Wednesday and we had to wait around 30 minutes until we were seated.  No problem, we ordered a house margarita ($9) and there award winning Horchata ($5.5) which was served in a Mexican Coke bottle with a glass of ice.  Let me tell you this is the way to enjoy Horchata!!  No watered down drink and you actually get a few servings because you get a full bottle.  It was the best Horchata I've ever had and would go back just to drink it again :-)  We ordered the Equites as an appetizer to start us out!! Wow we should of ordered (2). It was so delicious.   I went simple for the meal, Carne Asada Tacos served with a choice of side salad or french fries, I went with the salad and it was so yummy.  The salad was awesome, with the mixture of of with the fruit, cheese, and spicy peppers.  The tacos were delicious but I think the stand outs for this meal were the Horchata and the Equites we had before the main course.    As far as \"expensive\" Mexican food goes, Barrio does it better than the rest."}
{"text":"We have had good and bad service here, and my wife is completely put off by the location and the ambience. The parking is atrocious. There are no reservations, and if you're waiting for a table get ready to be pushed hard to order from the bar. All that being said, it still gets 4 stars instead of 2, because the guacamole and the regular menu items are that good. Of course they are 50% overpriced."}
{"text":"Good food, beautiful, historical setting. Way overpriced. Although I really really appreciate the back story and my mother's positive reviews, I honestly don't see this as anything exceptional foodwise in the Valley of the Sun except for the story behind it. Yes, I would go here again, but not for the food. Sorry."}
{"text":"Place gets real packed, 45 mins wait the day after Christmas dinner. Glad I waited since the food was delicious! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Very trendy and intensely gentrified.  Eclectic and interesting takes on southern Mexican cuisine, but really not that exceptional on the palette or the eyes.  Definitely worth trying but not worth doing twice."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Table side guacamole - soooo good!  Entrees were great (pollo poblano and tacos is what we all ordered).  Fantastic churro for desert (surpassed the Disneyland churro  as my favorite)... Very fresh food with high quality ingredients.."}
{"text":"Great food in the hood.  I was here many years ago and forgot about this little place.  Very casual and loads of Tequila... What's not to like"}
{"text":"My 100th review! I waited for something truly epic to come along. Here it is. The Barrio Cafe! I drove up to see my bio dad and his wife. They decided to meet at the cafe because they said that they have the best food ever. I was skeptical because I practically live in Mexico, so who has the best food? Tucson has the best food! Just kidding.   I get there and they're packed at 2pm. That's saying something. We had some somewhat slow service, but the guy was super nice so I'm not docking anything.   We get the guacamole first. It has  pomegranate in it or something like that. What?!?! No. This was the best dang guac ever. I mean ever. I ordered the carne asada tacos. It was served with fries and two very unique sauces that I didn't think to ask about. My step mom had this cheese stuff and this corn stuff. I had a bite of the corn and it was incredible. The tacos were awesome.   We had an excellent visit. This was a perfect choice in dining for the occasion. We did end up putting our lady Guadalupe on the floor because we needed more room for food. I'm definitely not religious, but I hit a huge traffic jam on the way home. Next time Lady Guadalupe can stay on the table I guess. I give this place a million stars. One million.   I'm coming to Phoenix for training next month. I'm ready to gain some weight! I hope you're ready for me Barrio folks!"}
{"text":"Some have complained this name is inaccurate, that it's not really in the Barrio. Whatever. I had a great meal at Barrio Cafe. the Horchata is extremely legit. The guacamole with pomegranate seeds was original and a taste sensation. If you get anything, get the guacamole. The slow roasted pork with marinated onions and tortillas was amazing. I also tried the stuffed chiles off of someone else's plate, very simple dish but well executed. The restaurant was clean (if a bit small) and service was attentive."}
{"text":"Great food, got the tres tacos (shrimp).  Good food, a tad bit expensive."}
{"text":"Very few times I make the decision of giving just one star. Unfortunately, this is one of those times. After reviewing the place before our travel we were so excited and Dreaming about trying this supposed to be amazing Mexican flavors in Arizona.  When we arrived we were positively amazed by the art and paintings of the building. We couldn't wait for the food!  The server kind of cocky, not what I'm used from my Mexican brothers and sisters, brought a menu with interesting prices.  I found them high but then I thought....  It might be that good on flavors and portions. ... Let's wait.  To our big disappointment the food was flavorless, specially the pork they announce so much. My thoughts?  How bad could you be in the kitchen to make a flavorless pork?!!!  No salad in the tacos,  no sauce, no sign of real Mexican delicious flavors and shameful portions that would not be enough not even as an appetizer.  But the worst thing ever,  when we asked for salsa picante or hot sauce...  The server said they did not have any homemade!!!!!  And brought us a bottled salsa...  And a cheap one!   Art wall were really cool.    Chef Oj Cepeda Owner of 1973 A Latin Joint"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. We went to check out all the hype. Food was good. I was surprised they don't serve beans. The table side guacamole was okay. It's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I give the food five stars, but there are negatives to consider.  The food is amazing. The best mexican I've ever had this side of Cabo. This is as far from TexMex as you can get. Quality recipes. Complicated tastes. Truly elegant. This is high end cuisine. Service was impeccable. For great food you're going to pay though. Dearly. Lunch: an appetizer, two entrees, two iced teas and tip: $65.00.   Now the negatives. Location: it is in a bad of town. I wouldn't want to be there after dark. I consider this to be a lunch only restaurant. Parking is behind the restaurant which makes a good shield for car burglars. The physical plant is very old. Not well kept. There is a single unisex bathroom which is incredibly small...as in dollhouse small. I was there at 2pm on a Friday. The bathroom had obviously not been serviced from the noon lunch rush. It needed a lot of attention. The restaurant is small overall and incredibly noisy. If you don't cater well to noise and close/crowded spaces, this restaurant is not for you.  This was my first visit. I will definitely go back. The pros outweigh the cons."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is every bit as good as the 981 previous reviewers said it is!  I am going to keep this review a little shorter than most of mine... because, well, there are 981 other reviews that this is similar to.  I started out with the Chata, a delectable combination of Agua de Horchata, Crema 1921 Tequila and Kahlua.  Yum... and very strong!  If there was more room in the front bar area and some better music to dance to, then you can be sure I'd have been cuttin' a rug after that drink.  The drink is highly recommended.  Hanging out in the overly crowded bar area is not so highly recommended... but it's what you expect at a popular ristorante like Barrio Cafe.  I was seated shortly thereafter... and ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  Cochinita Pibil is a house special -- pork marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted over night, topped with pickled red onion and Yucatán-style pico de gallo.  !Excelente!  I was not wowed with the service that night... but otherwise, it was a wonderful meal.    **** 4.5 STARS ****"}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place but, the last two times I went here, the food just hasn't been very good (except for the guacamole) and the service has been slow. Also, ridiculously overpriced for the dive that it is. I've been here about four times. I don't think I will go again. Its just not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food! The only downside is they are a little pricy but really the prices make sense with the quality if the food/ingredients. I will say that I thought their margaritas all were pretty expensive. It would have been nice if there were some cheaper ones as well as the pricier/fancier margs.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Unless you love cube food, don't go here, it's not mexican.  I did not care for the food and did not like sweet enchiladas for soo much money.  I was expecting to come to this place and be wowed, but was not impressed, too expensive too small of a place and I like my food spicy."}
{"text":"Excellent food, extremely slow and inattentive service. Sent a message about my service and did not receive a response. Birthday not acknowledged. Received our tacos one hour after being seated."}
{"text":"Lovely place, more upscale than I thought, and the place is great!  Shrimp tacos and a salad for lunch.  Great service and the salad and shrimp were perefct. You get three small street tacos with one fried shrimp.  Kinda small and I could have used one or two more, but I'm full...   I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"I flew into Phoenix for a brief trip to Chandler...  I asked the folks there if we could go to a really good Mexican restaurant.  Where they took me was a cookie cutter sort of place that is indistinguishable from any other Mexican restaurant.  I did some searching on line, and I found Barrio Cafe.    I got out of the factory early today, so I blew a run to Barrio.  The place was packed, so I ordered takeout.  I got the Chile's en Nogada and the Suizas.  The waiter told me that they would travel well (which was good, because I had a 20 minute drive back to Chandler).  Well, I can tell you this was right up there with the best \"food\" I've ever had.  I hesitate to call it Mexican simply because the ingredients trend to that region.  I loved the Chiles, I would be money that the suizas will be better than most, even reheated!"}
{"text":"If you want a high price, fancy shmancy place to impress someone who doesn't expect chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant, then go here. I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants and homes. This isn't my idea of real Mexican food but it must serve some people's expectations with the high ratings. Bruschetta instead of chips and salsa? That's just not right! I didn't even think the meals were that good, not did my son. It's different so if you go here, expect to be surprised, possibly not in a good way which was my son's and my experience."}
{"text":"Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is always excellent. I went today with my Dad for his birthday. We always get the guac. Get the guac!! it's so good... it's sweet with pomegranate seeds (i think), spicy with jalapeno, and just delicious.... it also has cilantro, avocado (duh), salt, onion.... it's great! So I usually get the pollo poblano which is delicious chicken with goat cheese and tomatillo sauce.... yum. But today we wanted to try something else so we tried the cochinita pibil at the waiter's recommendation. I am so glad we did! It is slow roasted pork that is roasted for 12 hours.... it just fall apart and yet is so juicy.... It was delicious. It came with spicy mashed potatoes and zucchini. It was all delicious. The pork came with little tortillas to wrap it in and then I put the guac on top.... whoa. Delicious. I will continue to go to this restaurant because although it is expensive... it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. We came here on a Sunday morning for brunch.  From the outside, it is very unassuming. As soon as we opened the door, we heard the sound of live music and were overtaken by the mouth-watering smells from the kitchen. The waiter was very friendly and helpful.   We ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer and it was life-changing! Sooo rich and tasty, I would've ordered this is a meal by itself. YOU MUST ORDER THIS! For my meal, I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was a light and tasty dish made with black beans instead of pinto beans... yum! With my meal I had a mango mimosa, which was tasty and refreshing. Even though we were already full, the waiter highly recommended the flan and we just couldn't turn it down. The flan was creamy and delectable! It was served with strawberries and little crunchy chocolate pieces. I highly recommend it!  In addition to the food and live music, the other thing that I LOVED LOVED LOVED about this place was the artwork. The Day of the Dead artwork was absolutely breathtaking. I will definitely be coming back to this place the next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chiles en Nogada!  The best dish ever!!  You have to try it.  Seriously.  Barrio Cafe rocks!!!"}
{"text":"My friend raved about this place...at first I was hesitant because of the location...but let me tell you how amazing the food is...I can't wait t come back...give it a try and you won't be disappointed...5 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful night and experience there last night! The server was helpful, maragatitas were strong and flavorful, guac so original, enchiladas tasty & the churro dessert was great! I can't wait to go back and try other dishes! PS You can't make a reservation so try and go early!"}
{"text":"Only tried a couple of things - a bit pricey but overall exceeded my expectations- horchata is really good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here a couple weeks ago for our first date and it was out of this world good. We did the wine pairing and each and every course that was brought out matched the drinks perfectly as well as the ingredients to each and every dish being not only authentic but very true to exquisite Mexican cuisine. I cannot wait to go back and eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I really wanted to like this place, had been perusing the menu onlne prior to coming and was excited to try.  I know going in this wasn't your typical Mexican restaurant and that was part of the appeal for me.  Unfortunately, despite having creative and great sounding items on the menu, the execution was just poor.    I had the poblano pepper stuffed with mushrooms and goat cheese, wrapped in puff pastry.  I also opted to add the mix of scallops, crab and shrimp for a $5 upcharge.  Sounds great right?  Not so.  First of all, this dish was clearly made ahead of time (perhaps days) then reheated.  Puff pastry should puff and be crisp right?  This was flat and soggy.  The mushroom filling was OK but with no hint of goat cheese.  The extra seafood topping was not worth the price.  Yes you got a ton of scallops (bay scallops, not sea scallops), but the sauce was beyond bland, except for hte fishy taste of some of the scallops (again, made ahead and reheated I think).  My husband got the conchinita pibil which was better, but again, clearly reheated.  How do you dry out pork shoulder wrapped in banana leaf?  It was dry, and again quite bland to us.  The bread and tampanade was OK, but not great.  Unlike some of hte other reviews, our service was actally quite good.  Prompt and attentive.  It was a bit pricy, and if the dishes had been executed better, fresher and with more flavor I wouldn't have minded the price.  However, based off this experience, I doubt I'll give it a second shot - unless I get stuck at the airport, then I may try that location."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! It's super small which can be frustrating because of the wait but it is so worth it! I had the cochinita pibil and it was like heaven in my mouth. I've never experienced so many flavors in my mouth. I've had cochinita pibil from other places and they have NEVER come close to comparison!! They art on the walls and graffiti on the outside are beautiful and live up to the name of the restaurant. I can't wait to come back here again!!"}
{"text":"The food was not good and our server was a total jerk. I was showing my friend around who was visiting and it left a bad impression on her."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite non-traditional Mexican cuisine in Phx!!     Happy Hour: variety (7) and taste of tacos are great and for $1.50 each - good value!  The sangria is delicious.    Dinner: the Pescado is AMAZING!  LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for his birthday because it's his favorite restaurant.  I just don't love it as much as he does.  We went around 6:30 and only had to wait for maybe 20 minutes.    For an appetizer, I had the Queso Fundido.  It was yummy!  I don't like their chips because they are too hard.  I like them light and crispy.  But I was able to get extra bread from the waiter, which was good.  I like that I was able to order the dip without mushrooms too.    For my entree I ordered Torta de Filetito.  It almost looked like a hamburger.  The beef was okay.  I wish I had ordered it without the roquefort cheese.  I didn't know how strong it was.  I absolutely hated the taste of the cheese.  Nothing special here though.  I did love the churros for dessert!  So delicious!  It came out with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and ice cream.  You definitely have to try it!  Overall, it's okay.  I just don't get all the hype about it."}
{"text":"This is a must try! Friendly staff, the horchata is amazing, and the margaritas come very strong. The restaurant is small but we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. Its worth the drive to PHX, we will be back."}
{"text":"EASILY my favorite Mexican Restaurant in PHX... hands-down. We've been here several times and I have no idea why I've waited until now to tell the world how yummy this place is.   It's VERY small and can get busy, but it's worth the wait! Drinks are great, margaritas are a perfect balance of alcohol and mixer, and there are plenty of marg choices!   On the most recent trip, I started with the Lobster Quesadilla and it's nothing short of perfect. For the main course, I had the Chiles en Nogada, which is a poblano pepper full of chicken, pecans, apples, pears, apricots and spices with some white sauce, oaxaca cheese and pomegranate seeds on the side. This was recommended by my server and it was my favorite meal here so far. It was a perfect balance of flavors that I wouldn't have (and initially upon ordering didn't) expect. On my previous trip I had tacos and my friend had chicken with mole sauce on it, and she explained it was the best mole he's EVER had.   Service is always great, not too overbearing but always there to quickly refill drinks and take your order or bring your check. I love its chill vibe but fun/authentic atmosphere. When out of towners want to know where to find the best Mexican food in a town full of it, this is where we tell them to go. It's not as touristy as other Mexican restaurants, but that's one of my favorite things... it's not overly cheesy (literally and figuratively). :)"}
{"text":"Hold to your hats boys and girls - excellent food, I wasn't sure what it al was but it was outstanding. Love the people, live loud - go here.   Do you like tequila? Go here! Do you like guacamole? Go here! Do you like Posole? Go here! Do you like flavor? Go here!   I've stopped here 6 or 8 times while is phx, az - it's close to the airport and I always have time coming or going to go here. Sometimes when I'm going I feel like I'm ... It's that good.   Unique and fun"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.  I visited my cousin in Phoenix and on the last day I was there we had lunch there.  We were there just as they opened, and after about 15 -20 min of being there it was almost jam packed.    After only trying the guacamole with pomegranate, yes, pomegranate seeds, I knew this place was gonna be killer.  I ordered the Cochinito Torta (sp?), and it was phenomenal.  So, juicy and tender, I would've like to order a second one, but it's quite filling.  It also comes with spicy fries, which I was open to, but a little hesitant about them.  The fries  come with a house made ketchup that is the best ketchup I have ever had, without exaggeration.  They were super good even when I ate them 2 hours later at the airport.    If you ever make it to Phoenix and you have one meal to eat, eat at Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"Really liked the food here. The guacamole had cranberries in it, which surprisingly tasted really good. Lot of food choices and some good fish dishes. Its pricier than most mexican places but its worth it. I don't eat pig or cow but the chicken and fish were good."}
{"text":"The food was alright. I went there with my ex and her friends when this store barely opened. I don't know the taste of food as of now but back then when I ordered $30 full course menu thing, it wasn't tasty at all with small portions. The owner of this place was interviewed by my ex girlfriend and he was hitting on her. I felt a little uncomfortable. But that was back then so I guess it fine now"}
{"text":"It's so nice to see upscale Mexican food.  It's such a rare sight.  Many clever menu items here, and plenty of really cool artwork, both inside and out.  The seating area can be pretty cramped though.  I came here for some late lunch and ordered the filetito.  A thin slice of filet mignon, with their own marinara sauce, on a French bread bun.  The sandwich was overflowing in its own juices, nearly impossible to eat with hands without making a huge mess.  Like a Mexican sloppy joe.  I also ordered their homemade horchata; not really a fan.  It was flavorful, but I hated the consistency.  Barrio Cafe has live music during lunch hours.  Just some light acoustic, nothing too heavy, so it was quite enjoyable.  If you to want to enjoy this place, come during the late lunch or early dinner time.  It will be easier to get seated."}
{"text":"I'm giving Barrio 5stars for a couple of reasons, yes the food was delicious. I had the chicken burrito, the flavors were fresh and rich. Too often burritos end up being a mishmash of a bunch of unidentifiable flavors, not with this one . My husband had the Arizona burrito, which is pork with green chili sauce. Equally as good as mine. I didn't love the chips which was just as well I don't need the extra calories. That said, the reason I give 5 stars is the staff.  The manager was sweet and accommodating and the waitress was also helpful and professional.  You will love this place."}
{"text":"My hubby and I heard about this restaurant on DDD with Guy Fieri. We were in the area and dined here on Saturday, April 18. We arrived a little before 6 PM and were surprised to find the restaurant pretty empty. By the time we finished our meal, the place was packed.  We ordered the Pollo Poblano, Cochinita Pibil and split a Flan for dessert. The food was delicious and the service was fantastic!!! We recommended this restaurant to family members who live in the are and they will be visiting Barrio Cafe soon."}
{"text":"Another review of Barrio? Yea, why not.  5 of us went tonight. They had a special Margarita with a great tequila, simple with only lime juice and triple sec or something.  Very dry and yummy ($11).  Tableside Guac is fantastic with the pomegranite seeds and also the Queso Fundido (sp?).  The Queso Fundido is a little bit of work to eat as the cheese tends to be a bit stringy.  You have to just go right for it and show no fear.  It is quite good.  I ordered the Conchinita Pibil Tacos (roasted pork) which were great.  They come with a starter salad or french fries.  I had the salad and loved it, great dried cranberries in it.  Hard to explain to people why they are having a salad or french fries at an upscale white table cloth \"mexican\" restaurant.  But it works.  My tacos do conchinita pibil (pork) were great, with a little Casera cheese (a treat).   There are 4 small tacos so I got to trade with my brother who had the fish tacos which I thought were even better than the pork.    My partner had the Enchiladas Mole (a favorite).  But in truth, I may be bored with this dish.  I thought it was a bit dry, and lacked flair.  Not sure what it is, but it just seemed flat.  Was like that the last time I went also.  I love the Mole sauce, but the enchilada itself was boring.  Oh, and the second margarita was even better than the first.  Service is cocky, maybe even strict at times, and very pleasing overall.  They know what they are doing and you can trust them.  Was a bit noisy tonight, as there isn't much sound deadening.    I honestly can't stand it when they have live music - ditch that.  If you haven't been, it is a must.  Parking:  Sucks.  Bring your friends car, park out back and don't worry about it."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  We loved it! The food was excellent,  so delicious,  but a little small. I was surprised there was no chip and salsa, but the bread that was served was good. We had a wonderful time.  I enjoyed the live music too. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my top restaurant, Mexican and non-Mexican. Originally I wanted to go there to try the churros with goat's milk dessert. But naive me realized the entrees and guacamole are where it's at. Any time I have guests willing to shell out a bit more for a meal, I always stop here. There's usually a wait of about an hour, in that tiny restaurant, but it's worth it. Their homemade pomegranate seed guacamole (cranberries when pomengranate is off season) is a must. And I love how instead of chips and salsa on the tables, staff bring pieces of bread with this oiive tapenade. I have never had a bad thing here, from the tortas to their duck. If I could afford it, I'd eat there once a week 'til I conquered the entire menu. On weekends, they have live music which adds to the already casual, urban atmosphere. I once went to a cooking demo with chef/owner Silvana. That lady knows her stuff!"}
{"text":"I really liked it, but it was to hipster for my mom, who only orders chile relenos.  I liked the variety and the unique take on the dishes.  The salads were amazing!"}
{"text":"We found out about Barrio Cafe after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.   We went at the perfect time as we were able to get a table right away. It filled up while we were eating. The space is tightly packed but not horribly too tight. The only drawback it how loud it got at times with people talking.   I ordered the Cochinita Pibil while my boyfriend ordered the Chiles en Nogada. The pork in my Cochinita Pibil was very tender but was missing some flavor. Chiles en Nogada, on the other hand, had such an amazing flavor. I would recommend that to anyone. They both came with tasty mashed potatoes and a corn and zucchini side. Very yummy.   The staff was friendly and helpful with questions we had."}
{"text":"Food: Trying to be fair, I will not compare the food here to authentic Mexican food that I order off the truck in Mexico or San Diego.  While the food overall was good, it was not spectacular. But decent for Phoenix area. The horchata drink was a little watered down, and the grilled halibut was tender, but expensive at $20. The best part was the table-side guacamole with the pomegranate. The pomegranate had a distinct flavor and crunchy texture that contrasted well with the avocado. The churro dessert was great.  Service: A bit slower than I would have liked, but I recognize that they were busy on Thursday night.   Ambiance: The tables were too small for the 6 of us (they put 2 tables together), and the overall area was cramped. But the live music was really nice touch.   Price: ~$10 for appetizers, $15-$20 for entrees.  Margaritas were really pricey at $10-12 each.   Overall: It's not great value, but the food is decent and the ambiance and the live music makes the entire dinning experience 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"After getting blown off by Lola Tapas, my birthday party of 6 came here. (This was on my list but had wanted to try Lola, so glad I came here!! Lola will be another story!) Anyways, so didn`t have a reservation, arrived at 8:20pm, told the manager we were celebrating my birthday(my friends were crammed behind me with armfuls of gifts!) and he said he would do his best to get us in under an hour.       So we all tried their sangria, OMG!!! Can I say wow? Sangria with red wine, fused with jack daniels and mango on the bottom! I loved it!!!During the wait, enjoyed the atmosphere of live music, artwork, and watching the delicious dishes come out. We got our table, and started out with their tableside made guacamole. More high marks!! This had pomegranite seeds mixed in, I was in heaven!1 So was my group! Our entrees arrived and I had a chicken-crab torta with avocado pico dressing and mole on the side. It was fabulous!! We were all very happy with our food, and they brought me a birthday flan! I felt very taken care of here with the service! I will definitely be back! Thank you Barrio!!"}
{"text":"They have Great food! Whenever I'm at the Phoenix, AZ airport, I will be eating here!  The table side guacamole with \"persimmon seeds\" is sooooooooooo Fresh and Unique! A must try!"}
{"text":"The food is still amazing! Great little place to eat relax and enjoy some good company! Thank Barrio Cafe!"}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix for the first time, and of course, it's hot as balls. The fact that it can be 100 degrees at 9 PM is very confusing. My co-worker said, \"We're going to eat at Barrio Cafe.\" Fine. I'll get a margarita and I'll feel less... wet.  Fast forward a few hours and I've consumed not one, not two, but four margaritas, each one more delicious than the one prior. I've consumed an amazing bowl of tableside-crafted guacamole. And I am face deep in a pile of the most amazing cochinita pibil that I've ever had. True, my cochinita sample size is an N of 1 but still... ridiculously good.  Then, against my better judgement (not that it was in a good place after 4 margaritas), we ordered the chocolate cake and the churro with goat's milk caramel. ¡Ermagerd! Total. Food. Coma.  What can I say? The sweating was worth it for food this good."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Me and my family are from Mexico and it gives Mexican food a bad name. Very small portions. Extremely over priced. Food takes extremely long to come out. Had to order red chicken enchiladas because they didn't have beef enchiladas and to top it off there was no red sauce. Wtf who does that? Never again will I go there. White washed Mexican food."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I read about Barrio Cafe in The State Press Magazine's \"Best Of\" edition.  Looking to squeeze something new and hopefully exciting out of the Phoenix Metro area, so the six of us decided to try it.  The wait was long...about an hour, and since not everyone was drinking  we waiting outside on a bench directly outside of the bar.  The wait wasn't as long as they said it would be and we were seated in one of the rooms of the low ceiling white wall adobe interior (ok, that makes it sound bad, because of the lighting, it was nice and cozy not stark and confining).  We ordered the Guacamole to start because it is supposed to be their \"signature\" as it is made fresh right in front of your eyes at the table.  Apparently quite the draw for most patrons as our server informed us that  EVERYONE ordered it and that she and the rest of the servers all really hated making it (that made us feel GREAT).  The guacamole was however worth it (even if it was insinuated upon us ordering it that we were 'restaurant tourists')  There were basically no vegetarian options and it was quite the scoffing matter on the part of our server when I requested a substitute of beans on a chicken dish (\"We don't serrrve beans here.\")  I wound up getting the same dish, just without chicken.  All of the dishes (veggie or not) were small for the price (and for being a full dinner).    The margarita I had was tasty, but not enormous (I think it was about $10).  I like a big margarita with Mexican food, call me crazy.  There was a live duo that played for a while during our supper.  They were entertaining, but not too distracting and still allowing for conversation at our table.  Although I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (it's pretty small), there seemed to be a number of large groups there which I found interesting.  All in all, I'm glad I had the opportunity to check this place out, but it's definitely not first on my list of places to go back to immediately."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!  The food is always good and the drinks are always on point.  I had the Pescado del Mar, which was absolutely delicious, and my friend had the duck entree, which was also delish!  I just can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"My \"foodie friend\" insisted I try this place and has been talking about it for a very long time! We went today. I had to park in the back which is surrounded by an unsavory residential area. So parking was my first concern. The restaurant inside was quaint and nice. For such a highly acclaimed restaurant, I wasn't at all impressed with the service. I was not greeted. Since I was meeting my friend, I decided to just look around myself. I understand that this is not an On The Border or \"traditional\" Mexican food as soon as I open the menu. Unfortunately, that's the kind of Mexican food that I like! No chips and salsa. Isn't that a staple at any Mexican restaurant? They served bread, which wasn't even good. Very basic bread like what you could purchase at Basha's and some type of chili/tomatoe spread. I skipped that. We ordered guacamole which was awesome. Too bad the chips they served were so dry and bland. Again, in my opinion the guacamole would have been so much better on the thin salty chips that I am used to! I was starving so I decided to get adventurous and order something that sounded somewhat familiar. I ordered what I thought would be a simple chicken enchilada. It was a mole sauce, which I had never tried before. Not a fan. I had just a couple bites. This \"mexican bitter chocolate\" sauce had no place on food at all, but I've heard a lot of great things about it, so maybe it's just my personal taste. My friend's pulled pork was delicious, had a couple bites of that. I've obviously realized by now that this is Mexico City type food and not traditional \"beans and rice, chips and salsa\" type food. The meal was served with a side of very soggy vegetables-again, not typical vegetables that you would even want to eat, so I didn't understand that either.Is this a side? Is it a garnish? Is this creative? What the F I am hungry!! I had a bite of what I think was zuchini. It was almost like they were soaked in oil and steamed. I would have loved to have spotted and better yet tasted anywhere in anything we ordered some cilantro, some green onion, but no such luck! Again, I realize that a lot of people probably love this restaurant. Just putting my review out there to help those who have not been be aware of what kind of experience they might have. I would never go there again."}
{"text":"I am going to give my honest insights on my experience at Barrio's. The biggest issue I had was with the service. After being told our table was getting cleaned up, we were finally seated 15 minutes later. Furthermore, it took the server 7-10 minutes to acknowledge us and say he would help us in a minute. In this time, the waiter had been  attending the table behind us three times in the time we were completely ignored at our table. Once he took our drink orders and we ordered our appetizer, it took another ten minutes to even get our water. It then took another ten minutes to have our orders taken. This happened after my sister got up from the table to talk to the manager about the time that had passed. Sometimes I can't help to notice that the value on service in a restaurant comes from the leadership. This was apparent when my sister talked to the manager...  Needless to say, our food took forever to come and was completely lackluster. I ordered the carne asada tacos which were good as they should be for $13. I dabbled in the various dishes my table ordered and wasn't impressed by the textures and flavors. The table side guacamole was small, had too much lime juice, and was slapped together effortlessly. The funny part is that we waited 30 minutes for this guacamole I could've made at home but instead I paid $12. How embarrassing!   When we got our check, we noticed the 20% gratuity added because of our party of seven. I understand adding gratuity but it finally made sense why we were given horrid service because the service didn't have to work for the tip. Also, not often do I find the gratuity at 20% and on top of that, for such lousy service. It was quite a disappointing experience. I have always heard good things about this place but unfortunately I believed what I heard.  The reason why I didn't give this place one star is because the tacos tasted good. However, even with a decent plate of tacos, it doesn't overcome a very disappointing experience. If you need recommendations of a place to eat, let me know. I'm all about supporting local businesses but this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"The food is an absolute 5 Star experience. The only reason I said 4 stars instead of 5 is that the kitchen is extremely slow. We went for a celebratory lunch. There were 6 of us from work and it took an hour and 20 minutes for our food to arrive. The waiter made sure we had bread and he kept our drinks filled up but in the end, it was a 2 hour lunch. I will definitely go again the fish tacos are to die for, but I'll go in the evening when I have plenty of time."}
{"text":"barrio cafe is the best mexican restaurant that mexicans never go to, which is too bad for my people because they're missing out. best thing i've had there is the cochinita pibil. when you're waiting for your table (always a long wait) at the bar (always crowded) order an icy cold michelada with extra chipotle tabasco. mmmmmmmm.  addendum: - attention mexican-americans: barrio cafe serves food that is VERY similar to what is served in nice restaurants in southern mexico. just because there are white people eating at barrio cafe doesn't mean that it's not real mexican food. and just because you've never heard of most of the dishes on the menu says more about your level of exposure to mexican food than it does about the restaurant. - attention non-mexicans: yes, mexicans IN MEXICO eat fries. no, rice and beans are NOT served with every meal IN MEXICO. and i'm not talking about rocky point or cabo. i'm talking about MEXICO. in fact, rice and beans on the same plate is usually only seen in the US. - attention burrito eaters: stay away. this place is too fancy for you. don't waste your money. you wouldn't appreciate the food here anyway. - attention everyone: yes, barrio cafe is expensive, but so are most nice restaurants. just because you're used to eating $6.99 combo plates doesn't mean that all mexican food is like that.  please, everyone understand that the \"mexican food\" that is served in 99% of the restaurants in texas, arizona and california is VERY different from what people actually eat in the country of mexico. don't go to barrio cafe expecting anything like what you normally eat.  honestly i'm just shocked at all the comments about how barrio cafe isn't \"authentic\"."}
{"text":"Very good hole in the wall. We must admit, when our taxi driver dropped us off from our hotel, we wanted to run; there were bars on the windows! But as it turns out, the bars are the place next door. Okay, maybe it's not that much better but let me just say, it's the locals place because as it was, we just barely beat the line that ended somewhere around the corner outside.   The food was pretty good but not the best we've ever had. There were some interesting dishes that aren't typical of what you expect of a Mexican restaurant, but we regretted not stepping outside of our perceived notions of what Mexican food is exactly; everything that passed us by looked amazing!   Definitely the bees knees of the area so go if you can."}
{"text":"BEST chips and tableside guac ever. Huge tequila selection. This is not your typical Mexican; Chef Silvana is a James Beard nominated chef and a visionary. I've enjoyed blue corn lobster enchiladas before, and they have fantastic mole!! Super cool art all around, cool bathrooms with beautiful crosses and Mexican colors. Live music sometimes, and the service has always been great for me. Celebrated my birthday there with 12 people, so despite the quaint & cozy size of the restaurant, it is possible to have a large party as long as you give them ample notice. **Note: you can not park in front of the restaurant; you must park behind (VERY FEW spaces) or on a side street. So the parking sucks, but this place is SO worth it!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had high expectations about dining here, we arrived and parked in the rear, where we admired the interesting graffiti art that engulfs the entire edifice. We found it very interesting and it set our mood as we entered the restaurant. Upon entry we were met with the sounds of a lone singer belting out a ballad of not so sweet tones and were sat at a table for two. Hugo, our server, promptly arrived to take our drink order...water and iced tea, more like iceless tea sitting in a pitcher on rolling cart in the middle of the dining area that was bled down to a murky tea tinted water mixture. I ask Hugo to bring us a glass of full strength tea from the source not the openly exposed watered down pitchers on the cart. Low and behold, my wife received a glass straight from the pitcher! Arrg! I asked again for some undiluted tea and received a glass of just as diluted tea from a different pitcher sitting on the bar in the other room! Note...this will be last time we see Hugo at our table until our food arrives, not one refill is offered as my glass lays devoid of water throughout our entire meal. I ordered fish tacos and spicy fries, my wife ordered an omelet with zucchini. The tacos were literally the size silver dollar pancakes, the tortillas were not warmed. They encapsulated one inch long battered fish pieces that were 60% batter and mushy to boot. Appetizer portions at best. The fries were undercooked and limp. The wife proclaimed her omelet as pretty good but unremarkable. Not being much of Yelp reviewer, but a regular reader/user, this experience pushed me to change that..."}
{"text":"It was okay.. I kind of wish I got something other than they're known for (slow roasted pork). I think I made the wrong choice of ordering it in a torta. The bread was really cold, and not a bolillo. More like a dry wheat focaccia. Maybe searing the bread with some butter prior to building the sandwich would go a long way. The pork itself was good. Really tender and flavorful. I'll probably be back, but will go with something else.."}
{"text":"I find that the trick for Barrio Cafe is Sunday brunch.  They have the full menu and a brunch menu.  Arrive at 11 when they open and you won't have to wait for a table.  This is Mexican food the way your Mexican grandma on acid would make it.  Traditional, unexpected and with a few twists.  No cheesy beans and rice here.  No bland, tomatoey enchilada sauce here.  Just delicious goodness brought to you directly from Mexico.  The 'adult bevvies\" are delish too.  Sangria, Margs and assorted others.  But they're  not cheap, so don't drink too many!!"}
{"text":"No joke, this is probably one of the best Mexican places I've ever been to. It's a small cozy place in central Phoenix, where they have local artists work hanging up the walls. The price is not cheap,  but it's worth every single penny for what you get.   First, I had the Barrio Bomba Margarita. Phew! I was buzzed a quarter way thru lol It was very tasty though! Two thumbs on their margaritas. I had the shrimp tacos and boy they were phenomenal! Life changing shrimp tacos! My boyfriend had their seafood enchiladas and he loved it too. Their servings were very generous. Last but not the least, the churros were amazing! I read an article that it's one of the top 10 best desserts in the greater Phoenix area. No wonder! It is to die for. I would go back here just for that.  P.S. We are huge fans of the murals outside the restaurant! Such great work."}
{"text":"Food was good and authentic. I tried guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it and was thinking I would like that mix but it was actually very good.  I asked our waiter to substitute fried shrimp with my tacos with sautéed shrimp and he made that happen without hesitation. Everything that came out looked very well played and full of life.  The graffiti \"amazing artwork\" alone is well worth the visit. It's literally all around the entire building and in the neighborhood just behind the restaurant. In addition they sell art at reasonable prices, it's displayed on the wall inside."}
{"text":"First time we tried Bario Cafe in Phoenix and it was a great meal. Not your usual refried beans Mexican! The guacamole made at the table was a nice touch, never had pomegranates in my guacamole before! Their acclaimed pork dish cochinita pibil was superb and the pescado del mar was nearly as good. Go hungry as the portions are very generous. Will definitely visit this Mexican favorite again on next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The place is a bit loud but the food is pretty awesome. The energy is good, I highly recommend the enchiladas but the horchata isn't my favorite but still good. You have to get the fresh guacamole when you visit. Staff has always been great."}
{"text":"We all know what to expect in an air port but this seemed to be the opposite.  The margarita was actually the worst part of the meal. The tacos de la cochinitas looked small but were packed with flavor.  The place is packed and service is decent."}
{"text":"Saw an AZCentral article that lists Barrio Cafe as the \"No.1 Mexican restaurant in the United States\" by Tabelog. Seeing this the wife and I were really excited to try it out. I have had really good Mexican food all over the country and Phoenix has some of the best.  The wife and I drove down to Phoenix for dinner and was surprised by all the cool art on the outside of the building. Inside was loud and cramped. Being so cramped the staff kept bumping into each other and occasionally the customers too. I usually dont mind how a restaurant looks, I'm there for the food.  The first thing I noticed when opening the menu was the high prices. Some dishes are over $20 and I've noticed the prices have gone up referencing past menu prices. I'm one that doesn't mind paying a high price for food but it better be worth it. We ordered the $11 Guacamole del Barrio which is supposed to be prepared table-side for dinner but we didn't get that treatment. Nor did we get the complimentary bread and salsa that others on Yelp have said they received. We also ordered the carne asada tacos and fish tacos each dish at over $13 for street tacos. The taco dishes came with fries or a salad. We opted for the fries which are the thick cut style fries w/seasoning. Service was really slow.  I went from being excited about the food to being underwhelmed. The carne asada tacos were good and the beef tender. The fish tacos were good as well and the fish crispy. The Guacamole had pomegranates which were a nice addition. The fries were so-so. The food was good but nothing special. I was expecting to be wowed by the amazing \"No.1 in the United States\" kinda food but felt let down.    The bill was almost $60 for Mexican food that was nothing special. I have had better in the valley at multiple places and haven't had to pay nearly those kinda prices. Must be the chef hype we are paying for. All in all I felt rooked. I really hate to feel that way about a restaurant especially one that has received really good reviews.   I dont think we will be back due to the high prices for over-hyped food."}
{"text":"I took some friends from work to the 16th St Barrio Cafe and I was very disappointed in the quality of the food. The  guacamole was fine but that's easy to make. The main courses were either swimming in cheese or just overcooked. We had to wait about 40 minutes to get a seat for the five of us and they tried to be accommodating, but in the kitchen I felt like they didn't pat attention at all to the quality of what they were serving. I will not recommend this place any longer to friends. It seems very hit-or-miss and I don't like gambling on quality."}
{"text":"Barrio Café. I cant express the joy Barrio Café has brought me. The food is more than food. Close your eyes and take a bite...that feeling, taste, all of it is not eating but an experience. Open your eyes & there is music, conversation, art, it is a barrio. This is the neighborhood cafe. I've been a semi-regular since they opened. A fellow Yelp'er & myself came across an ad in a now defunct magazine & we had to check it out. Being Mexican & always on the hunt for good Mexican food, not that water down stuff sold all throughout the state, we gave it a go. I would have given it a 5 star review as I ate. The food = amazing. The waiter became a friend in only one visit. (miss ya John) The ambiance was what I liked. Best guacamole ever. I have had the privilege of speaking with Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza. Have a Tequila question, ask away. She is one of the nicest people I've ever met. So, in conclusion, GO TO  BARRIO! Read the review, try it yourself, make up your own mind."}
{"text":"...I actually think I like Barrio Queen better.   The menus differ and for my palate, the selection at Barrio  Queen is more diverse.  I did like the Margaritas here, and the service pretty good.  Overall a nice place, but not amazing."}
{"text":"PRO:  The food is good.  Better if someone else is paying.  CON:  The prices are absolutely way too high and the portions too small.  I won't be going back unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but read the menu carefully because there's some interesting little \"surprises\" such as pomegranate seeds in the guacamole. Unique... sure... but it made me feel like a picky little kid (pet peeve of mine btw). The Posole was really amazing but the place gets 2 stars because the service was unbelievably S-L-O-W. There were only 3 parties including us in the place and we still didn't see the waitress for way too long. At one point I had to get up to go find her. Plus... I overheard her giving much better explanations about HH pricing and menu options to other tables. Would have appreciated hearing that info before ordering. Overralll... not coming back."}
{"text":"I didn't really love or hate this place. I don't know if I'll travel down to the depths of mexico again (the area was a bit frightening for me), but the food was overall good.  I came with 4 friends on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. No wait, no problem getting a table.  We were served bread which I found odd. Bread with my mexican food? I'd rather have chips and salsa, but I guess bread works. Needless to say we didn't finish it. It came with this tangy salsa stuff. I don't know what all was in it. Maybe roasted red peppers, mushrooms and capers? It was decent. A little too on the tangy side. I ate my bread slices plain. My friend HAD to order the guac. It came with dried cranberries in it. Very basic tasting considering it's added flare. I didn't find it amazing or worth the $10.95 it cost, but whatever. She enjoyed it thoroughly and it got me some chips in the end.  I got the \"Chicken Tacos\" and it came 4 on my plate. Decided to go with the fries instead of the salad, and they were brought out with a chipotle ketchup. Can't argue with the portion size, but I'm not a guy. I actually had left overs so I can't argue with that. My friend got the cardne asada tacos and those looked good. Other friend got some chirizo potatoes and a egg fratata thing off the brunch menu... She liked it. I dunno. Nothing I would order.  I can say that I missed beans & rice and being served chips and salsa. In the end I spent 20 bucks for a diet coke, 4 tacos, a few slices of bread, and some fries... Your call.  Oh and parking sucks :)"}
{"text":"A must go place! This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. First we ordered the guacamole barrio which had pomegranate seeds in it. I must say that was a great addition. They also served us french bread with some Mexican pickles which were amazing too! Then we ordered the Enchiladas and Tacos. Though I don't remember the names of those dishes but I will never forget the taste! Amazing food. The other most striking thing about the place was its decor. Felt like I was transferred to Mexico! They also has a musician performing live. I will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on a Thursday night, which I'm sure helped because we didn't have to wait at all to get seated.  I ordered the Suiza Enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered the Carne Asada Tacos.  The enchiladas were $19, which I thought was a bit expensive.  In fact it was more expensive than any enchilada I have ever had before.  But then I tasted them and immediately realized they were worth every single penny and then some.  They were cooked to perfection and the flavor was unique and amazing.  They could have used a little more kick, but that didn't really detract from the experience at all because the flavor was so good.  The Carne Asada tacos were certainly above average, but didn't quite knock our socks off the way the enchiladas did, though we don't really have any complaints about them either.  We then decided to try dessert.  And after deliberating for several minutes, decided on a $12 churro.  We both thought \"for $12, it better be the best churro ever.\"  Well, it was.  It too was worth every penny.  In addition to that, the service was impeccable and the experience overall was fantastic.  I can't believe I waited so long to go to this place.  It is now one of my favorites and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant, I've had Barrio Cafe at the Phoenix  Airport. I figured if the food is this good at the airport the restaurant has to be better..... and it is! Great food good service, I will return everytime I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This surprising little place near central Phoenix is tantalizingly delicious. As you drive in, please admire the artwork on the buildings and fence behind the restaurant. Amazing. We arrived about 10 minutes before our table-mates but were seated immediately. Our waiter was friendly and so helpful regarding our choices. We started out with the Barrio Bomba Margarita (me) and the Cadillac Margarita (him.) Very nicely iced and mine was rimmed with both sugar and salt - great combination. The bread here that comes with the olive tapenade is absolutely delicious - a wonderful start to our meal. Dinner for hubby was a small bowl of the posole before the Torta del Barrio, a roasted poblano pepper sandwich stuffed with oaxacan cheese. that posole is probably the best we've ever had. I had the Torta de Cochinita Pibil, a rich roasted pork sandwich topped with sweet purple onions. We both had the crunchy french fries on the recommendation of our waiter with the cocktail ketchup dip. Yum. We tried the kahlua chocolate caramel cake for dessert and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweet after a filling meal. The food here is so flavorful - not too spicy at all, just the right amount. It wasn't too crowded on a Sunday evening (thankfully) so we didn't have to wait long. They do not take reservations here either - first come, first served by a gracious staff. Get on over there and enjoy."}
{"text":"For weeks I have brooded over what I should write about for my 400th review.  How would I celebrate such a milestone??  A splurge at a AAA four diamond restaurant? A Scottsdale shopping trip? A review of someplace my husband and I visited during my recent trips around the state? After much pondering and a couple of meals at mediocre Mexican places here in Phoenix, I remembered that I have never written a review of what is considered by most to be the premiere Mexican restaurant in the valley: Barrio Cafe.  Barrio Cafe is a classic in Phoenix, located in what used to be a single family home in a historic part of town.  Their food is superb.  They serve classic Latin cuisine elevated to a new level.  The menu consists of both regional Mexican dishes not found at your average tourist taco shop in Tempe or Scottsdale nor the mom-and-pop AZ-Mex places located in every strip mall in the Phoenix metro area.  The chef also throws in a few items that can only be described as nuveau Mexican. This is where the Latino foodies (¿comiditos?) eat.  My personal favorites are the cochita piblil and the red mole.  I also really love the mango shrimp salad - this makes a light, refreshing meal or a great appetizer good for sharing due to the beautiful plating.  The duck in Tamarind sauce is also fantastic and something I have never had anywhere else. In addition to the fabulous entrees I have described they also have tacos and tortas as well as a brunch menu but since it is nowhere near my home or work I have never been here for breakfast or lunch.  I hope maybe someday..."}
{"text":"We went here for the second time last night and it did not disappoint. Service is very good but not overbearing. Ordered the guac made at our table for an appetizer which was fantastic. Pomegranate seeds are a nice addition. Every dish was packed with flavor, but by far the waiter's recommendation of the Veracruz was the best. Moist fresh fish and the chipotle potatoes were stellar.  Wish I could go back again tonight."}
{"text":"Best guac I have ever had. Fantastic cuisine and wonderful murals and history. The crepes dessert was out of this world."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here on a regular basis.  The atmosphere is cool and different than most places in Phoenix.  The prices are higher than a typical Phoenix restaurant, but the food is exponentially better!  I always get something with seafood at Barrio and a margarita.  You also need to try the table-side guacamole with pomegranates.  It's great."}
{"text":"I love living closer to central Phoenix!!!  Restaurants are so much better over here!  I had tried Barrio Queen in Scottsdale a few times before getting to the Cafe.  Totally different atmospheres! Love both! Table side guacamole is a must at both locations.  I always get the cochinita pibil and a couple margaritas but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow! Visited Phoenix, Az and went into this restaurant with local friends.  Unassuming front leads you into a world of delicious mexican food.  The guacamole made at the table was excellent, the tortilla chips seemed like they were freshly friend for each table, the extensive margarita list was amazing (I suggest the Cadillac).  Now for the menu, its amazing, I've gone twice and got the same dish the Tacos Cochinita Pibil, like a moist pulled pork taco stewed in Mayan spices and a homemade tasting queso fresco.  I cannot recommend this dish, nor this restaurant enough.  Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the raving reviews, I had to check this place out for a Saturday night dinner.  We all liked the food, but the margaritas were not great.  I don't think the food and drinks are worth the prices they are charging.  The restaurant is very small and cramped.  I would go back if one of my friends really wanted to, but it is not on the top of my list.  Bottom line....overpriced!"}
{"text":"So grateful there is Barrio Café in town.  Imaginative and innovative and delicious meals abound.  The murals on the walls outside set the tone for your experience of great authentic Mexican food.  Having guacamole prepared tableside is a bonus.  Depending on the season, they add pomegranates or dried cranberries to the mix.  Never would have thought of that, and it's amazingly fabulous."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Not a beans and rice place, although those are fine too. Had a baked pepper stuffed with chicken with a cream sauce, mashed sweet potatoes and grilled fresh corn. Wonderful. Will go back a lot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped her for dinner while in Arizona for a friend's wedding. It's tough to find decent Mexican food back home in Buffalo. This place was hands down the best Mexican food that I've ever had. We had the table side guacamole, which I would highly recommend as everything is super fresh and delicious. We each ordered the cochinta pibil for dinner, which was full of flavor. If you have room for dessert, the churros were delicious. They also have over 1000 types of tequila for any margarita aficionado."}
{"text":"The reputation of this place was stellar!  I was stoked to try some new food.  I got a dish that had the mole on it.  Definitely not for everybody.  I literally scraped this thick molasses-like substance off my chicken and it still tasted like I was eating sauce only.  I ended up eating a lot of chips for dinner that night."}
{"text":"This had been one of my bucket list restaurants to try and it did not disappoint.   Came here for my wedding anniversary on a Friday night at 6:30 pm and was worried that we would have to wait. I tried to call twice and got the answering machine. We had a half hour drive so we decided to go for it. As we were on our way my wife was able to call them and they said about a half hour wait so I thought let's do it.  As we got there I saw an empty table and were seated right away. Bonus!  Nothing fancy for the decor but a home feeling and nice and casual.  Was brought to our table and quickly had a basket of bread and salsa. The bread was so soft and the salsa was an olive base salsa which was awesome.   We started with the Fresh Guacamole with Pomegranate Seeds which was prepared on a cart in front of our table. The waiter asked which ingredients we would like to add in and then he mixed the guacamole in front of us. Excellent and fresh! Would highly recommend.   Wanted to order some of the traditional mexican food such as the street tacos but ended up going with what the waiter recommended and was not sorry for what we ordered on recommendation.   We shared the Pescado Del Mar and the Filete Mignon Tita.   The Pescado Del Mar was a filet of Halibut topped with shrimp, scallops and crab, and a shallot of white wine cream sauce finished with longaniza chorizo sausage and Carmelized onion.  The Filete Mignon Tita was prepared as requested and was one of the most tendor filets I have ever had. Also came with a chipotle mash potatoes that was excellent.   We finished with the Churros Rellenos which were 2 churros with a large scoop of ice cream topped with caramel and candied pecans.  What a great evening of dining and celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"I am officially on a Mexican food kick.  Gourmet G. says it all.  What I love about Arizona -- having authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that this will be my FIRST ever one star review. :( I was really exited to try this place. A group of friends and I love checking out different restaurants in Phoenix and we had a friend who just bought a home in Arcadia.   The first time we went to Barrio it was at the airport and the service was so horrible I didn't even want to bother with a review because I figured....well, it's the airport. No service is ever that great at the airport.  So we finally had an opportunity to get the gang together and head down.   We were warmly greeted by a server and she seated us to our table. Then she went to attend to her tables in the other room. As we started to sit down, there was a tray table blocking one of the 4 chairs so we moved it slightly to slide in. BIG mistake. The server looked at us and condescendingly said, \"OH. Excuse ME, ladies.\"  WOW.   So, we looked at our menus and waited and waited and WAITED. We were slightly confused. Where was or server? Why were we waiting for 15 minutes without ANYONE coming by? There was a server that was attending other tables around us...but not us?  So we kindly asked the busser and asked him if he knew who our server was. 4 minutes later...the SAME server comes to our table and *I KID YOU NOT* looks at us in complete hatred and says in the rudest manner, \"WHAT CAN I GET YOU LADIES?!?!\"  Like WE were bothering HIM!  I seriously couldn't believe it. We were in COMPLETE shock. I looked at his name tag and RICHARD certainly does not belong in the service industry. If you ever want to try this place out-AVOID him at all costs!!! I honestly wanted to ask for the manager but I didn't want to ruin the meal any further than it already had.  To boot, the food was sub par anyway. But-I can probably chalk that up to Richard's piss poor attitude.   I really should have listened to my gut and to  other Yelpers who have mentioned that this place can be unwelcoming. I just really didn't  want to believe it. If you're going to try Barrio Cafe, please bring plenty of patience and don't bring your out of town guests if you want to impress them. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for several months as it always seemed to pop up when I was looking for places to eat around downtown. This particular Friday night was finally a night where both my boyfriend and I decided that some good Mexican food was in order and we arrived just after 8pm.  We arrive and park in back and had no problems finding a parking spot. We come through the back door which is always slightly intimidating in my opinion but we stroll on through and make our way to the hostest stand. We were met by a man who asked how many in our party and our name. No smile or a welcoming Hello. Maybe he was just having a bad day. We were told we had a 20 minute wait. We walk the 5 steps over the bar and decide to order a beer while we waited. Unfortunately, the bartender had just stepped away and didn't come back for at least another 15 minutes. As we finally order our beer and she hands them to us, our table is ready. We are sat on the other side of the restaurant, near the back of the room next to the waiter stand with the registers and the bathroom. I HATE getting sat back here. I get that someone has to sit there but for me, it takes away from the whole experience of the restaurant and clearly dampens the ambiance. Our waiter arrived after another wait and he must have been having a bad day too because there was no smile, no hello, it was just \"What would you like to drink?' and a quick run down of their menu. At this point I'm beginning to think that maybe this place isn't known for their service and am hopeful their food will make up for it.   We order the tableside guacamole. I get that this is normally an expensive appetizer and you pay for the presentation but for the price, you usually get someone who doesn't have a scowl on their face and using the shabby metal cart that was sitting next to us at the waiter stand. All the extra ingredients for the guac were placed under a towel and once he finished, he placed the towel back over it and wheeled it back into the corner. Fancy. The guac was good but not worth the cost in my opinion. I WILL be adding pomegranate seeds to my own this summer though as that was an interesting addition and would be great in the summer!  My boyfriend ordered a dish that was some sort of pepper stuffed with meat and cheese that he liked but didn't finish, which is a rarity for him. I ordered their house special, the cochinita pibil which is a slow roasted pork with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. The pork tasted like something that could have come out of my crockpot. Yes it was tender and the flavor was...well, like a pork roast. Nothing special about it at all. The mashed potatoes had some additional ingredients and were the best thing on my plate but the steamed veggies were just that, with a little seasoning. Pretty bland.   Overall, between the lack luster service, sitting in the worst spot in the restaurant, and the okay food, we have to many other places to try and will never be back."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on reviews we read online. We knew this was not an inexpensive mexican restaurant. Although it feels inexpensive based on the location and the atmosphere, the food is upscale. Tapenade at beginning of meal fine, but I've made better. House margarita is $8, but very good. Server was okay, but not overly friendly. Halibut was on special with a lobster tail and some shrimp, for $35. Can't beat that. Halibut a little overdone. My husband had some type of torta, but the bread was HUGE and very dense, so he was little disappointed. Not what he was expecting, but said it was delicious. Lots of choices, and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. I would come back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at Barrio is something i always look forward to. the atmosphere is cute as can be. the artwork is always interesting.  and the food is really something special. so today i am out with family to sunday brunch.   my favorite thing is the coffee, I'm a huge fan of french press, and the coffee is unbelievable. i ordered the huevos con chorizo. very tasty. the chorizo is semi spicy. accompanying the eggs and chorizo are the potatoes. very tasty. waxy potatoes steamed till tender and then i think pan cooked real quick with some seasoning. how ever they are cooked they are very good. we also ordered the guacamole. typically if you get dinner guacamole they prepare it at the table for you. brunch..they bring you a bowl of it prepared in the kitchen. no complaints here. i just like it anyway i get it. very very spicy with a hint of sweet from the cranberries they toss in. always satisfied when i leave barrio.  they open at 11:00am for sunday brunch and expect a line. at both entrances. show up after 11...expect a line.  either way its worth showing up for.  I've eaten dinner here a few times, which i will leave another review the next time i go. for now i think the brunch deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. The shrimp tacos are sooo good. I made the mistake of filling up on bread and chips and could only eat two of the three tacos :(   We also ordered the guac, of course, which is so good. They make it table side and you can customize it any way you want. We left out of the onions and got the jalapeños on the side for me. I also ordered their horchata which was amazing. So rich and creamy and delicious. It may be the best horchata I've ever had. I wonder if they make it in house? I bet!"}
{"text":"Barrio has issues, but the fare is unusually satisfying. Masterful even. Sure, it's busy and loud, a little too expensive, they dont take rezzies and the parking's cramped, but this is the kind of inventive, non-formulaic food  that makes dining out memorable, even joyful, and the other stuff worth enduring.    Tacos look small and naked on the plate, unflanked by rice or beans, but are delicate, yielding and delicious - overstuffed with marvelous fresh ingredients; not the \"fresh\" touted by Taco Bell, but dreamy cheese, flaky halibut, exquisite slow roasted pork, fresh avocado wedge, secret sauce,etc.  Messy, surprisingly filling and an absolutely first class oral shindig, completely divorced from \"tacos\" elsewhere, and well worth the 12 or 15 dollars or whatever it is they charge. I like the fish tacos at Cheesecake Factory (which are bigger), but Barrio's are gastronomically in a different league.   Soups are flavorful and textured.  My companions rave about the mole and the duck.  The pork torta is amazing.  To call the warm churros with ice cream a \"treat\" is a criminal understatement.  If you're on a budget, take your date just for the churros. Later, you will have sex.  It may not trump dessert, but you will have sex.  ( If for some reason, you dont, leave that person at once. You will never please them. )   Not everything on the menu elicits quite that euphoria, but there are half a dozen items that flip my feral bioswitch from \"eat\" to \"devour\", like a wolf over fresh kill.   It's like a click in my head, and this Silvana Salcido Esparza Comida de los Dioses, or whoever she is, deftly holds the switch.    I'll forego comment on the bar because, surprisingly, I dont drink."}
{"text":"Posole was spicy and flavorful. The quesadillas are open face and small if you've got an appetite order the enchiladas and top with chorizo. The quest is a meal in ans of its self"}
