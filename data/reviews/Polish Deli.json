{"text":"Love this place! It's very clean and has authentic Polish items from chocolate to perogis to even the beverages! Also the owner is so nice I felt like I was back in Poland again"}
{"text":"With my husband being of Polish descent and me being a huge pierogi fan, I felt it was necessary to make a stop here when we were driving by the other day.

Do you like beets?  If you do, then get over here and find every kind of canned and frozen beet product imaginable.

Other than the numerous beet products, I also found: candy, beverages, chocolates, a case of meats, and even some corn-curl type things with a scary rabbit mascot on the front of the bag.

Oh, and there was Polish TV on which I thought was fun.

Unfortunately, I couldn't eat most of the stuff here (that's Polish food in general though).  And more unfortunately, I was expecting some homemade super fresh pierogi, but instead was pointed to the freezer section.  I bought some anyway thinking that maybe they were something special but was disappointed again.  Instead of having a lot of potato like I'm used to, they were filled with lots of ricotta-ish cheese that I wasn't too fond of.

If you like sausages and such, be sure to make a stop here."}
{"text":"So there I was, after promising a friend to bring red horseradish for a Passover seder.No one in town seemed to have it. The usual places as well as the unusual ones. Stopped at Polish Deli. Found excellent Red Horseradish. Crakovia label imported from Canada. $2.99 for 8 ounce jar. Same product offered on line from Polish Deli in Pittsburgh for two dollars more. Glad to be living in Las Vegas. Very nice place to shop for Polish food items and products."}
{"text":"I am unsurprised by the lack of reviews because I am aware Vegas is devoid of European culture. Most Polish restaurants/delis have gone out of business/moved and have been replaced with Mexican restaurants (as if the city was severely lacking Mexican cuisine). This place is in the middle of town but I am thankful everyday that it exists. This sklep is small and the owners seem to prefer those who are American to Polacy.They have Polish baking flour, an assortment of pickled goods such as kapusta,  pre-made soups (barszcz,  bigos) farmers cheese, frozen pierogi (although these are incomparable to homemade) Tymbark juices, teas, rye bread, spicy ketchup, mustards, sweets(Wawel and E. Wedel chocolates!), etc.. Behind the deli counter they have an assortment of kielbasa and cheese. When I'm lucky I am able to find Almette Smietankowy (yogurt spread). 
If the Polish deli goes out of business, fuck it.... I'll move to Chicago."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving Polish Deli two stars.  I used to love this place.  Alas, something has gone horribly wrong.  Rows and rows of empty shelves.  Diminished selection.  What happened??

I used to stop by Polish Deli regularly.  Then, I got lazy, and ended up just going to Euro Delicacies because it was closer to my house.  In the interim, however, Euro Delicacies has surpassed them with selection of Polish goods.  Polish Deli still has the biggest selection of pierogi and Polish meats in town, but that's not saying much.
 
You can also pick up Polish teas, over-the-counter drugs, and Wedel chocolates, something I haven't seen elsewhere in town (which are in the refrigerators because it's like 90 degrees in the store).  I'll still stop by for my blueberry pierogi and kapusta czerwona (red cabbage salad) but, then again, maybe I won't.  Seriously depressing."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing experience in the Polish Deli!  My father is trying to impress a young Polish girls so we stopped in to learn a little about the culture and try some of the food.  What a delight as we tried the best sausages we've ever had!  Talk about addicting!  The cashier showed us several candies, cookies and snacks that would be familiar to the Polish and we took several home with us.  The place is so wonderful and the service was great.  She even taught us some of the Polish language!  I highly recommend!  We're new faithful clientele!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of deli meats and sausages , they also carry a small selection of refrigerator and frozen foods. The prices are good and the owners friendly . Store is very clean and well organized. Check them out.  I always feel better when I patronize a local, family owned business."}
{"text":"Just want you to know if you looking for excellent, authentic polish food this is the only place to go! We were more than pleased with how clean it is inside. Drove from Boulder City today and all I can say again you have to try this place out. Coming back for sure. Larry H"}
{"text":"I searched the Vegas Valley for polish food made just like a polish deli, Polka Sausage, in Calumet City, IL., a South Suburb of Chicago, offered. After trying several different polish deli's in the Las Vegas and Henderson, Nevada area, my parents found this place and the food is an identical match! Along with my Aunt and Uncle and now my grown kids, the (8) of us have been going ONLY here for well over a decade. The kids and I LOVE the cheese, potato, meat and plum pierogi's, which are actually made back home in Chicago! Totally a family favorite! They are also offered in sauerkraut. My parents, Aunt and Uncle always get Kiska, fresh and smoked sausage, dried sausage, and deli ham and they all are delicious too! I totally recommend this place, you can't go wrong here. They also offer all the traditional polish cookies, cakes, pastries, candy, crackers, etc."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! All the foods i remember as a kid! I have tried so hard to find some place that sold the same things I remember when I was a kid and it was nice to finally find one after eight years of searching this place is amazing will definitely be back!!! You can tell it's a mom-and-pop shop which is absolutely perfect and great and how it should be!  they were friendly helpful the prices are very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Great blood sausage, and lots of other wonderful meats to explore.  The proprieters are very nice & helpful, and the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"I went in there for the first time during the week. I am having 21 people over for Thanksgiving and want to have some Polish food available along with our traditional American meal. I went in and bought some meats to sample before I bought in bulk. I bought a link of the Kiska (blood sausage) and three links of kielbasa. The prices were amazing. I bought a bunch of meat for $13.00! Excellent quality of meat! Everything was fresh and very tasty. Even my husband and children ate the blood sausage. lol Of course they didn't know what they were eating but they LOVED it! I will be going back to stock up for our feast. The only thing disappointing was no home made pierogis or other dishes. I will make my own, no biggie! I would have loved for them to serve hot meals such as glomkie or kapusta! Yummy!! Maybe I will have to ask if they have some hidden in the back room for special customers. lol"}
{"text":"What a freaking bummer!

I was in the area and having seen this on Yelp, I knew that I would need to stop by and check it out.

It is very awkward being expected to know Polish things and always having to fake it when someone asks you something!

I had hopes that this establishment would offer a culture smack down thus supercharging my thirst to learn Polish things.

I wondered around the store confused and attempted to take it in.  For some strange reason I thought I would be able to get a sandwich at a deli?  My small town Southern Californian naivet√© once agains has gotten the better of me!

After settling on a two litter bottle of \"Oranzada\" a Polish soda, I walked up to make my purchase.  I thought I would be able to make some small talk with the clerk as I made a way along to the road to a higher Polish education.

With the formalities taken care of at the cache register, I proceeded to ask how long the shop had been there for.  \"9 years\" was what I was told as the clerk turned their back on me and walked away.

That was that and this is that and so I guess I will have to continue playing off all questions about my heritage while hidden under a cloak of uneducated deception."}
{"text":"Some of the people that rated this store don't have any idea of what Polish food is.Granted the store is quite small and limited as to inventory but the shelves are NOT empty,in fact quite full.The owners who work there are very helpful and polite.The selection of meats and sausages is always fresh the best blood sausage and ham in town.As to the AC it has been fixed and very nice place to shop."}
{"text":"Simply the only place in Las Vegas to get real polish sausages and other polish food and delicacies. The service is also great and friendly.  I shop here once a month and stuff my freezer."}
{"text":"I have been searching the city for a kielbasa like I remember from back home ... and now I have found it!  Bought the dry hunters sausage, kielbasa krajana smoked Canadian sausage, kielbasa weselna wedding style sausage, and my favorite Milanowek milky cream fudge. All absolutely delicious!  Store was very busy and the owners were very nice!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  Dziekuje Ci bardzo!"}
{"text":"With the Jones Market being just a hop, skip, and jump away, I'm not entirely sure how this place stays in business. I mistakenly thought the name \"Deli\" indicated that they made sandwiches, but sadly they only sell the components to make sandwiches yourself. Not a big deal on it's own.

But nearly all of their merchandize is identical to what you can find at Jones Market, and often at a better price. Plus JM has way more selection, as well as ready-made foods. 

This small store reminds me of the \"Russian store\" offered in San Antonio- very limited, with a  big part of the appeal being the frozen pirogies. The store is clean, organized, and well-lit. But again, the merchandize can be found elsewhere- even the frozen pirogies can be found at Sprouts, same brand, too, though not quite so many varieties/flavors.

There may be a small thing or two this store has that others do not- a specific variety of jam, or maybe a particular brand, but by and large this store does not seem to have anything unique to offer.

Even after reading reviews here, I was a little underwhelmed- and browsing their meat case, it was unclear which of their sausages was the \"amazing polish sausage\". Might come back because it's so close, but will likely continue patronizing JM as it's only a mile or so down the road."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have made some big purchases with my friend, who has a restaurant business.

The owners, husband and wife are have always been very friendly and helpful.

They offer a wide range of Polish Products, from beauty products, candy and of course their meats.

Though this is a small store front, there are so many items to choose from.  

You can't find a place like this anywhere in San Diego, so a visit to this Polish Deli is a must when visiting Las Vegas.

If you're looking for a meal, they provide made to order sandwiches too. 

I like their kielbasa and black forest ham. 

Remember, nothing beats authentic! 

I'll be back for sure because my friends business is booming and so is my craving for Polish Food!"}
{"text":"This place is nice. I am glad to find someplace to buy Polish food. I moved to California from Chicago and was amazed that i couldn't find Polish food ANYWHERE near me so when I went to Las Vegas I tried this place and was very happy. The only thing they didn't have was my Krakus ham but the had all the other Polish food I have grown up with and it's much cheaper then having someone ship it from Chicago. Looking forward to many trips back!"}
{"text":"Being a native polish person and living in Vegas for a while I've realized that there's literally no polish places out here, and then I found the Polish Deli! This place is my favorite, I go here at least once a week. They always restock and have such a huge selection available, and if you've ever been to Poland it feels like you're walking into a polish shop in Vegas; even if you're not polish the customer service is SO amazing, all you have to do is ask and Joanna, the cashier will help you with anything she's truly the nicest. She is also a native polish person so it really brings so much culture into this store. this deli is so much better then the rest of the other \"European\" stores I have gone to in Vegas, not only is the selection better testing and clean but when you walk in you feel a sense of culture, something that you don't find at the rest of these places. I would recommend going here 10/10, it's a cute and great place to go."}
{"text":"This store is greatly loved by my husband. He especially loves the Keisha (blood sausage) I am finding that polish food is good too. This store has many items and good customer service."}
{"text":"It's a nice little family owned spot in a strip mall.  They had so many different Polish items. I ended up getting Kabanosy, Polska Kielbasa, candies and of course Pierogis!!!  Worth checking out and I will be back again.  Yum!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great polish food this is the only place in Vegas that has what you need.  They have a nice selection of kielbasa, pierogies, dumplings and cheeses.  So many other little items that you can't find any place else.  Its hard to only buy a few items when you're here as everything looks and smells sooooo good.  If your looking for some great polish comfort food this is your place.  Stop by and give them a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've visited the Polish Deli countless times. The same friendly couple have been running the place for as long as I can remember! They've got all of your polish cravings, from kielbasa to pierogi! I would definitely recommend the fresh sausage and the Black Forest ham! The prices are also very reasonable as well. 

Overall, if you're looking for something new, give Polish Deli a visit! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food! Best polish sausage in the world!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Polish Deli twice and I got the same thing twice.  It's a Friday in Lent and my wife observes meatless Fridays.  What to make.  I was coming from Big 5 Sporting Goods and when I saw the Polish Deli, I got over to the right lane and turned in here.

A quick perusal of the freezer case and I found the pierogis.  I chose the potato cheese because I'm not fond of the other flavors.  I have never had one of the fruit flavored ones, but I'm sure they'd be OK for dessert especially deep fried.

There is a nice selection of Polish sausages on the counter behind.  I need to stop back and get some of their kielbasa.  It looks so much better than the stuff you see in grocery stores.

Service was pleasant and quick.  The shop is small and questions are answered very politely.

As a side note, this brand of pierogi, Alexandra's, was quite good.  Some fried onions in lots of butter and the pierogis baked for awhile, made a great meal.  I need to stop in here more often."}
{"text":"I lived in Poland for a couple of years and had to make a stop at the Polish Deli to look around a buy a couple of things I had been missing. This store was so nostalgic and took me right back to many little shops I had been to in Poland. Joanna, the clerk was super nice and was very friendly. it was great getting to speak Polish with a real Pole again also! This store had everything ...not a lot of options but something of everything. If you are wondering how corner shops are in Poland this will give you a good little taste. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat place! They sell lots of freshly made pepperonis and sausages. MMm smokey! The farmer's cheese is good - more pungent that what American farmer's cheese tastes like. The coconut Princessa wafer-candy bar was YUMMY!!! (def. getting more of those). Lots of fresh bread displayed. Do they have pierogies? Is 15 flavors enough? Seriously! Sweet ones, savory ones -strawberry, plum, meat & potato, beef, cheese, too many to name. They run about $4-5 per package. 

Have fun! Go wild! A unique little jewel in Vegas.

Closed Sundays."}
{"text":"I just came to get some sausages and ended up getting more lol.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We have a serious lack of any Polish places in Vegas, this felt like my old neighborhood Deli back in Chicago. Bread, \"Bulki\", Kielbasa....all the przyprawy you need for a Polish fest! 
i have always had a pleasant experience here every time I go. People are very nice, answer all my questions, let me know when things come in if its out.
A true Gem in the Vegas community!"}
{"text":"As a second \"generationer\", finding this small Polish shop was like hanging with my Dad and Uncles back in St. Louis when they made the weekly run to the local Polish deli. Not large but clean. I wish I knew more of Polish brands because they carry many in the dry goods, candies and drinks. I picked up some traditional horse radish sauces, some frozen periogi's and then saw the fresh meats both in the deli glass counter but also behind the cashier. Many types of kielbasa and traditional sausages. Came right home and had an old school kielbasa, periogi's and cabbage feast. I went on Wednesday and owner said fresh bread is brought in on weekend from Chicago. As far as people talking about not having or making sandwiches - traditional places like this don't do that. But old school way is to break off a hunk of kielbasa and grab a piece of rye bread and go to town there in the store or in the car on way home."}
{"text":"This is the store you need to go to if you love Polish food.  The store has a great selection of Polish food as well as great customer service, and friendly owners.  I will be coming back for all of my Polish food needs."}
{"text":"Prices weren't so bad. I wish they had more to choose from though.

It's a small owned business with fresh meats at the front counter. They have snacks, frozen foods and meats. I grow up in Ohio and you could easily find polish food there, but Vegas is lacking this. 

Employees were nice and let you shop without bothering you. I end up spending close to 40 bucks and could of kept going. 

I will return to try things I haven't before."}
{"text":"Best deli in Vegas!!! Amazing meats, polish products, chocolate and candy. Everything you need!
They get their meat fresh from Andy's a polish Deli in Chicago. Shipment every Monday, FRESH!!!!
Love the deli, love the owners, love the clean clean CLEAN store!
Definitely make your way there. I was born in Poland and lived most my life in Chicago. So I know Polish food and delis very well.
This is where everyone should buy their meats."}
