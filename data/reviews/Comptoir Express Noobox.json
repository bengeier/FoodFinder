{"text":"Decent portion for an over priced order. Food had no special taste to it, and I should've taken notice to their name, NOO to noodles here"}
{"text":"I ordered an egg noodle stir fry with beef and squid in soy+ oyster sauce. It was very flavorless, which is fine.  But I got a decent amount of eggshell in the dish. Which is not fine."}
{"text":"the other review on the page on this place is pretty funny because that was exactly what I was going to say.  Why did I eat that.  There are a lot of good Chinese restaurants here.   I was walking past,  it was easy and fast.  I started to eat it and kept thinking it would get better.  My stomach hurts.  That was not good food.  I should have thrown more of it away."}
{"text":"There are lots of choices here for a make your own noodle box. And the portion they give you is large, no one in our party could finish their box. The extras, peanuts, lime wedges, cilantro, etc. all cost extra so be wary of how many boxes you're ticking. You might end up with a much more expensive lunch than you had planned.   For a quick place that serves OK Asian food go here. Especially if you like being in control of everything that goes into your meal. Otherwise, head up the street to Chinatown."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there for lunch and I have to say it is very good.  You get to build your meal which is always interesting.  The place gets packed for lunch but the best part is the Chinese mother speaking French....it is right out of a Seinfeld episode.  I recommend this place ....the price for a lunch meal comes to aproxiamently $14 per person ( with a soup) taxes included."}
{"text":"\"Why did you eat there?\" my stomach grumbled 20 minutes after walking away from Noobox.  \"I wanted Asian food, it was fast and the staff was pretty nice,\" I retorted while climbing a hill.  \"You idiot, Chinatown is right next door. I will ruin the rest of the day for you,\" my stomach gurgled.  And he did just that."}
{"text":"Theres very few times Ive left a review.  Really the only thing i can say is this: these guys destroy thai express. Similar food, but way fresher and way tastier!!!  If you like thai express you will LOVE this place"}
{"text":"Meh...the portions are decent for the price and we liked the concept but we both thought that the noodles were overcooked and the sauces were not very flavourful."}
{"text":"Fairly good place. Love the customization you can do with your food. A bit of an interesting time trying to navigate without speaking French. The owner made us feel sort of dumb and got visibly annoyed with our lack of verbal communication.   Food was good, tasty and for $15 bucks can't really go wrong.   Check it out"}
{"text":"Ca fait la job quand on est press√© et on doit reprendre le metro tout de suite, beau decor, tranquile, bon service et rapide."}
