{"text":"They had the best ribs...and that's saying something since I'm a Chicago transplant.  All the menu items I tried were always tasty with that special attention home cooked goodness.  The staff was very friendly and their apple cobbler was to die for.  Yes...This review is being written today because I just left there. Although I was wanting some of their delicious food once again, I sadly report  that they've closed. :-("}
{"text":"Stopped today and had a great lunch - brisket & pulled pork were tasty - loved the original sauce.  The coleslaw was the best, a little different than other places.  Wonderful Texas potatoes.  All in all very happy with this place and will be back again."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of BBQ joints this was fantastic and tasty!!! Got the three combo platter Ribs, pulled pork, and brisket....Mac n cheese was amazing and Cole slaw tasted fresh! Was Sooo good I got another one to take home!"}
{"text":"First visit and it was good, especially considering its a pretty new restaurant. The meat is really good, the sides are hit or miss but overall not bad, they have a few beers on tap, and the water is good (which counts for a lot honestly). The atmosphere is lacking and the staff seems a little inexperienced, but nothing that would keep me from giving them another try. Also we were there pretty late so we didn't see what it is like when they are busy. 
My husband said the ribs were some of the best he's had, very meaty and tender. The brisket was excellent and the pulled pork was tasty but a little too smoky for my palate, would probably make a really good sandwich though."}
{"text":"W O W ! Great BBQ at an awesome price. I belong to the Planet Fitness Gym next door, and have been smelling them smoke their meats for a few weeks. Today my Wife and I gave it a try and I'm sure glad we did. My wife ordered the Nachos, but decided she wanted to mix things up with their Smoked Jalapeno Sausage, and they were very accommodating. I had a Pulled Pork BBQ Bowl that came with Coleslaw on top. We also shared a side of Texas Potatoes. For true down home BBQ, this place got it right. Great BBQ at a great price. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I go to Planet Fitness next door and everyday I look over at this restaurant. Unfortunately I usually work out after 9:00 PM so I hadn't lucked out to even have a chance to go inside.

Last night, I park and the smoke is billowing from the smokers which are right out front. Immediately I am overwhelmed with hunger for some good BBQ!

The smoke master was very friendly and invited me to take a menu, which I did and I vowed to return on Saturday (the next day) to try this place out.

First and foremost, this is not a super fancy restaurant. The menu is simple and the presentation of the food is very plain. In fact, you get a tray with some butcher paper and your sides come in styrofoam serving cups.

The meat is served \"naked\" but they have a variety of sauces to choose from.  I can tell you that good, smoked meat doesn't require a sauce but I still gAve a try to the sweet and sassy and the classic sauces (both were perfect!)

Back to the fact that the meat doesn't \"need\" a sauce. The brisket was absolutely perfect as was the turkey. But let's be honest, most BBQ places that you get a brisket from, it's slathered in sauce to hide the fact the meat is dry...
...not so here! After testing the different sauces, I ate the other 90% without any sauce.

What I wasn't prepared for was how good the Texas potatoes (side) tasted! I could literally sit down and just eat a bowl of these potatoes. I wish I could properly explain the flavor but nothing I could say would do them justice! 

The beans were also very good- nothing super special about them, but good flavor regardless.

So I polished off my meal and ordered a banana pudding to go. I've had banana pudding from California to Elvis' private recipe in Memphis and this one doesn't disappoint. Unlike a lot of places they don't cut the bananas in it or leave the wafers to get soggy until you order it- fresh, flavorful and delicious!

Arizona has long disappointed me with BBQ and I make up for it every time I go to Texas. I am thinking that I have a new place to call my BBQ home!

First and foremost- don't expect a lot of frills. Go in with the right expectation and expect your experience to be about the food.

Second, remember that this is a LOCAL and FAMILY OWNED business and they are providing a service to the community, by keeping more money in the community. 

Support your neighbors and eat some GREAT BBQ! What more could you ask!

Two thumbs up from the Ugly Pool Guy!"}
{"text":"strange little place.  strange happy hour.  strange service.  Food OK.  definitely need better signage."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try some BBQ and we found it! This place is great! The owners are friendly and the place is clean with a fun atmosphere. The food was delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the baby back ribs. Your meat comes naked and they have a variety of sauces on hand to try. We had the sweet and sassy and the hot and spicy. Both were delicious. They have a simple menu but don't let that fool you. This place is great! We will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"We love this place and try to go as much as we can.  The brisket nachos are our favorite along with the texas potatoes.  The brisket has so much flavor and is so tender.  Yu really get your bang for your buck as the nachos are large enough for 2 people to share. There is a ton of brisket on the nachos and they don't skimp on the meat and other toppings.  My husband loves the BBQ ribs and the fact that they come dry so you can add your own bbq to it. We brought some friends a few weeks ago and they had the brisket nachos and the pulled pork sandwich.  They couldn't get enough and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch special. Pulled pork and fries. Everything was awesome. The pork had a good smoke, the bun was fresh. The fries were awesome, I think they used seal salt?? The sauces were all good. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is good, probably some of the best BBQ one can have without going to Kansas.  

I've been here a few times and always have done take out.  Even though it has to sit in my car for about fifteen minutes, I love it.  Granted my taste buds like vinegar based sauce, but they have it!  More importantly they have a smoke flavor to their Barbeque that I've had difficulty finding anywhere else in this town.

I'm a snob when it comes to Barbeque, so if I say it's good, it's gotta be good.  

That said, I have had better in Phoenix, but to get that you have to find a dude with a smoker behind his truck and in a lot somewhere.  For a restaurant setting, this is it for the north side of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I come from Kansas City where BBQ is famous. This place has the BEST meat I've had ANYWHERE!! I live less than a mile from this place and didn't even know it existed until yesterday. I can't wait to try the nachos and other menu items. I had all of the meats..turkey, brisket, pork, and the ribs...all fantastic! The ribs are fall off the bone DELICIOUS! I want this place to stay in business so please Arizona...try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Needed to find a new BBQ place since are go to closed down. This was very good food, the menu is a little limited but they have all the basics for BBQ. Got a pulled prok sandwich which was great, meat was super tender. Boyfriend got the nachos with pulled pork which was also great. We both agree that this will be our new BBQ place."}
{"text":"We love BBQ and when we saw this place opened up we had to try. We were very impressed.  The ribs were awesome the brisket was great and the sausage was amazing.  The Mac cheese was delicious and the cheesey potatoes were the best.  We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. Make sure to try the Texas Potatoes. Everything I've ever had here has been delicious."}
{"text":"First time at this new BBQ and I was very pleased with my dinner. Had the baby back ribs and they were excellent. Right up there with the best I have had in AZ. The brisket was good but a little dry. I will definitely go back soon and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Good food...Pulled pork sandwich needs to be hotter though, pretty cool..."}
{"text":"Worth the stop! Great BBQ. Got the pulled pork sandwich. Love love love their BBQ beans. I also got the tangy coleslaw, not bad either."}
{"text":"Well that was delicious!  Ultra fast service, totally friendly and an obvious love of what they're cooking and smoking. The ribs were perfect!  Total true smoking at its best!  I highly recommend eating here if you love a true BBQ. Cole slaw was delicious with a little kick and the potato dish they serve was also highly recommended. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh yum. Love their BBQ. Thank wish they were open on the week days. The ribs were my favorite"}
{"text":"So went today for lunch and wasn't overly impressed.  I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Quesadilla and it was just cheese blend and meat.  There was no sauce in the quesadilla and it was an over abundance of cheese.  You couldn't even taste the smoke on the meat.  I did open it up and add sauce which helped but still the amount of cheese really took away from the item.  

The place was very clean inside with lot's of seating so that was the positive.  There menu had several options as well so maybe I'll have to try something else if I ever go back.  

I overheard our waitress telling a table they were busy in the beginning and now it's been really dead so I take that as a sign that I'm not the only one that thinks they are just ok."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was because I stopped by during dinner and not lunch, but I definitely wasn't impressed. They ran out of quite of a few items, including the ribs, but I expected this after reading other reviews. I ordered the 2 meat special - brisket, pulled pork, texas potatoes, and coleslaw. 

My take out order: the good - both sides were pretty good. The coleslaw had a peppery taste to it and the texas potatoes had a nice warm cheesy bite. The bad - you get about a handful of both meats that you chose, and unfortunately, both of my choices were quite dry. I definitely needed the bbq sauce, my choice was the sweet one though it wasn't anything special. Also, by the time I got home, a less than 10 min drive, the meats were warm at best. For $16 (tax included), I personally do not think it was worth it. The restaurant itself was clean, though it was empty at dinner."}
{"text":"Big surprise on how good this place was.  Without much fanfare this restaurant is putting out some great tasting bbq.  Tried the turkey nice and juicy, the brisket with a rich smoky flavor, and the pulled pork with coleslaw sandwiches yum.  For the sides they have some great tasting bbq beans, and  Texas potatoes  great tasting potatoes with cheese on them .  Nice array of sauces for the bbq as well."}
