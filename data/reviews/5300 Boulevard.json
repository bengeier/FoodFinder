{"text":"Horrible food, but good, friendly service. Grab a drink here and head somewhere else for food!

I ordered a delicious-sounding portabella mushroom sandwich with roasted red peppers, onions, brie cheese on a tasty-sounding bun. I got a small mushroom that looked like it had seen better days with some jarred red peppers on top of a ball park burger bun. No brie, no onion, no other ingredients that may have been listed on the menu. Ick - way overpriced."}
{"text":"My new 'worst-ever' restaurant experience happened here while I had a long layover at CLE airport. I dunno if the waitress had a particularly stressful day but it sure seemed like she was on the edge of a breakdown.  She was frazzled and forgot my order (I suspect), considering how long it took and the fact that it wasn't correct.  And when I asked for some ranch dressing on the side it took another ten minutes and I had to remind her about it.  

The food was unremarkable, not that I expect that much from an airport restaurant, but I sure wish I went with one of the fast food chains instead of this local joint.  I guess that's what I get for supporting the one place I had never heard of..."}
{"text":"Skip, skip, just keep walking! Thus place is bad. The food was OK, it so hot here, in as little as 10 minutes my ice in my drink was gone. And the waiter looked as if he just got out of bed. But the worst part was the little \"gnats\" that kept landing in my drink"}
