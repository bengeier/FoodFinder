{"text":"Visited this restaurant again. They added a \"buffet\" style price for all you can eat from the menu. I believe it was around $30 a person. You had better be hungry. The portions served were not as big as the regular menu items, but you can eat all you want and keep ordering. Everything else was as good and nice as last time. Very friendly staff, nice atmosphere, etc.. A very worthwhile place to eat and linger over great food. As a former Montrealer, I miss the old Cantonese style food served at the Yangtze on Van Horne Ave., but this restaurant is very, very good."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants asiatiques de l'ouest-de-l'île.  Biensûr, la décoration n'est pas merveilleuse (j'attends encore de trouver un resto asiatique 'chic'), mais la nourriture y est d'excellente qualité: les viandes sont tendres, les goûts raffinés.  Excellent également en livraison, ça arrive tout chaud même si on demeure assez loin!  Je recommande fortement!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with family. It was all you can eat, decent price. Service was fair, although at the end the server asked what drinks we had because he did not keep track  which was strange. The food was okay, a lot of deep fried dishes. The shrimp was delicious! Great place for families or large parties as it is all you can ear. Ambiance is fair. Would go back but not a first choice."}
{"text":"The dishes here are quite expensive. The quality is terrible.... Maybe it's the difference between Toronto and Montreal in terms of competitiveness, the same dish, with this quality, even at half the price, this restaurant still won't survive for 3 months. All six at the table concurred, represented opinion from Ontario and UK. Won't be back sorry."}
{"text":"I literally had to join Yelp because of the absolute terrible experience I had here tonight.  We were a party of 6 and 5 of us received our food while the 6th did not for another 15 minutes.   I asked the waiter twice and was given quick short answers because they were running serving the table next to us (party of 12). Finally I got fed up and asked to speak to a manager. While normally this should help the situation, this was not the case.   The manager was not only rude, but confrontational. He began to explain that there was a mistake (mistakes happen yes) and telling me how many chefs he has (4) and how he can't have them all work on our meals. I don't quite follow how a restaurants staffing is the customers issue? I said that all our food is now cold. He said \"no one told you to wait\". I'm sorry, has common decency gone out the window? I was raised to be polite. I said I would appreciate something to be done i.e. the forgotten meal be given at no cost. And was responded with \"I make 2$ a dish, I can't just do that\". Apparently this is the manager/owner?? He should be ashamed of his customer service skills, or lack thereof.   Oh and I threatened to write this review seeing as I have no other recourse... 20 minutes later he's offering a free drink. Needless to say at that point we declined."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing to rave at all about. Service was quick but the waiter was rude. When we finished our entrees, he told us \"take your utensils off your place, i'm not giving you other ones\". When we finished the main course he asked if we wanted dessert, we asked what he had and he answered, \"you know, the usual stuff\". Definitely not coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST Szechuan restaurant.  Hands down.   Here are my faves, and I've had each one of them at least 20 times in my life, and there has never been a time when the flavours and cooking varied at all - consistency is the name of their game!  - Hunan dumplings with peanut butter sauce  - Yam Gai chop suey salad - Szechuan pepper chicken with crispy spinach - General tao chicken - Szechuan pepper chicken with crispy spinach - Beef with black bean sauce  - Sauteed Singapore style rice noodles with curry  - Fried rice  The lunch menu is great, the dinner menu is even better!   This place is delish all around!"}
{"text":"Food here is always consistent. Hot, tasty, fresh. Won't find another Asian spot like it. I have been coming here for 15 years and it hasn't changed. Moved to Toronto and this is still my favourite spot for some Asian food :)!"}
{"text":"This place offers a goos variety of food at a decent price. I was underwhelmed by the greasy boneless rib appetizer and the pepper chicken entrée.  But the fried dumplings and green beans are  excellent!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Chinese cuisine in the west island. Their peanut butter dumplings cannot be beaten!"}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience on Saturday night. As one member of our party cannot have MSG, she ordered a la carte. Her chicken with crispy spinach came under cooked.  When she asked to have it recooked the waiter returned with the manager Eric who refused to reheat or recook the serving. When she said to just take it away as it was undercooked and she could not eat it, he said that it is served this way and made it plain that even if he took it away she would still have to pay for it. Most aggressive. Most adversarial. He never returned to our table. He sent the waiter who offered to replace the dish but the damage was done. Everyone's supper was ruined because of his in your face attitude. Normally the food is very tasty, but this particular dish was just under cooked. It can happen. What can't happen was the manager's response. We won't return. The nastiness we experienced ruined dinner."}
{"text":"I mostly order out from here - tonight ate in - food quality is excellent - sweet & sour pork - chicken fried rice - all good and nice service.   This is a very busy restaurant on friday, saturday and sunday evenings... call and make reservations."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. It's always amazing. Came here with a group of 20 for someone's birthday and the food was hot and came out fast. The banana chicken rolls and shrimp toast are a must try to start. My favourite main dish is Szechuan pepper chicken with crispy spinach and the sesame beef. There's a lot to choose from, and its all you can eat, so you have to get there hungry!"}
{"text":"If you're from the West Island/DDO/Pointe-Claire area, chances are that you've heard of or are a die hard fan of La Perle.  It's basically AYCE Chinese/Thai/Szechuan food. I've been twice, once for dinner with friends and once with coworkers for lunch.  Both times, the service was courteous and the food was abundant for the price. Really flavourful, good options on the menu... so much so they'll have to roll you out lol   My fave was the chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce, Szechuan shrimp, Hunan dumplings in peanut sauce, crispy sesame beef, sauteed veggies, as well as a delightfully light wonton soup to start.   For lunch, we each paid $25, and for dinner $46 each (special occasion + weekend).   Really worth a visit if in the area!!"}
{"text":"This is a strange place! It's been around for a long time. My father drags me here once a year so he can eat unlimited peanut butter dumplings. It's quite the sight I can assure you.   The food is pretty good as Szechuan restaurants usually go. Of course it's all you can eat, and by the looks of most of the patrons, this is common knowledge in the area. Where this place falls flat on its face is the decor. If there was ever a restaurant that needed some new chairs, carpets, wallpaper, paint, & tablecloths... this is the place! The food is probably at 3 1/2.  I recommend pants with elastic waist bands."}
{"text":"If you are looking for anything that resembles authentic Chinese food, this is definitely not for you.  Though the dishes are distinctly westernized, I have to say it isn't really all that bad.  Imagine a Panda Express, but with a sit-down restaurant setting, better food, a wider menu, and all-you-can-eat.    I have a hard time explaining to my dad how I can tolerate eating at distinctly non-chinese, chinese restaurants.  Well, my response is that as long as you don't expect chinese food, you might actually enjoy what is being served.  After all, sushi rolls with mayo and fried jalapenos are obviously not traditional Japanese, but ask me if I care while I stuff my face with its savory goodness.  Sorry but if liking orange beef is wrong - i don't want to be right.  (discount if you pay in cash)"}
{"text":"Had several good meals here over the past couple of years, but the last time--on Mother's Day--I had savage food poisoning, probably from the General Tao.  Will never go again."}
{"text":"It's a good place of you love MSG and food that tastes all the same. The only dishes I enjoyed were the fried squid and the noodles/veggie plate. Besides that, whether you eat pepper beef or pineapple shrimp, it all tastes alike. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Went to have supper for a family members birthday. Food did not take long to come out of the kitchen but it was definitely not fresh. The waiter was also very rude. Everytime he came to the table to pick up the plates he would say \"keep your utensils I'm not giving you new ones.\" I personally wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Yum :P Went for the all you can eat, 8pm reservations on a sat night, and the place was packed, but didn't have to wait long for service. I like the variation of sauces and meats on the menu. Not much noodles, but next time I'll ask if they can bring a side order of rice noodles instead of steamed rice, because the sauces the meats come in are awesome for the most part.  We ordered alot of different kinds of shrimp, and they came nice, plump, big and juicy, no shells escept for the tails.  The boneless ribs were big, tender and had alot of meat, but were bland and really needed the sauce that came on the side. The sauce was good, but it didn't really help. I think it needs to sit in the sauce to really soak in for awhile, otherwise I don't think I would order those again, regretfully. I hope they fix that, because it was delightfully tender.  I didn't like the shredded fried chicken, but the rest of my friends loved it so much. I didn't like the texture, eventhough i'm a big fan of chewy and crunchy, but I dunno, it just didn't sit well with me, I couldn't tell it was chicken.  I also really did not like the tom yum gui hot and sour soup at all. The rest of my table liked it alot, but I would have liked it if it was less greasy and more spicy, which was what I was expecting for tom yum. I actually didn't find it spicy at all. The general Tao was reallly spicy though, I loved it lol but when i comented on how awesomely spicy it was, my friends said I got the good pieces, so I'm guessing they weren't mixed well?  the peanut butter dumplings were addictive lol that sauce was so creamy, god dam lol loved it to the point of obsession lol  the lobster crab lettuce salad was a pure fail though. tasted like there was a layer of mashed up kiwi fruit ontop, which didn't go well at all. maybe if it was mixed in and spicy would have been better. But it felt liek a waste of lobster and crab, as their taste didn't really stand out in the dish.  we got some kind of a spout salad, that had cooked thin noodles ontop. first bite, i was like wtv, nothing special, then again.. and later again, then BAM spicy! which was awesome lol same effect on my friend. It wasn't like i was eating it continuously, i was eating other things, so i think the spicyess was just not mixed in properly so i got a big hit of it at one point.   We ordered chicken on scewers. My friends liked them alot. I tried one, it was meh. tried it with the peanut sauce side dish. was still meh. then i smothered it with the left over peanut butter dumpling sauce lol couldn't get enough of that lol  I love how they have jasmin tea on the menu! I'm a big fan of different types of asian teas, they're so much fun xp  i was very surprized about their icecreams. I expected the same general types like the other restaurants, and the waiter didn't describe them right. My friends go the chocolate, and it looked like there was chunks of something in it, and the icecream color looked like coffee flavored o,o if that was expresso ice cream with chocolate chunks, imma loose my shit, cause that's my favorite lol i'll have to check that next time xp i ended up just getting the rainbow icecream. I wasn't sure if it was rum and raisin icecream, or rainbow icecream, was hard to understand the waitier (legit foreigner, which i honestly love lol he was still so polite and very helpful though. great waiter!) what i ended up getting was a mix of orange and fuscia colored fruity flavored ice cream. Was not a bad selection, but if they're going that route, I honestly would have preffered an actual sorbet, which would have made a nice option instead of icecream.  The place looked fancy xp was 5$ more expensive than other all you can eat places, but I think it was worth it honestly. I really like how we don't have to calculate how many orders of each dish we get. Instead we just write down on a piece of paper what number and how many people want it, and the kitchen decides what the portion will be. This works out much better compared to the set quantity amount that the other all you can eat places i've been to have been doing. Real smart and helpful.   Honestly, this was the first time we were all full after just one round of ordering. Usually we order like, 5 rounds and we're hating ourselves for being so full xp but with the way they arrange things, we order soup first, apetizers second, than main dishes last on the same paper, and they come all in that order, with some time inbetween each course. It was nice, and I wasn't really use to it, because usually we just order a hoard of things. Still was a hoard, but ... still lol was much more organized lol  I didn't mind just having a blank piece of paper to write our orders down, but I forget that I write small sometimes, which can make the staff's job harder to read, so just fyi, write clearly. They didn't seem to have trouble with it though,, so that's good.  I wonder what a 50$ all you can eat place would be like o,o"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Perle for as long as I can remember. Let's start by the obvious: some of the dishes are incredible good. The peanut butter dumplings alone are worth driving from Terrebonne for. I also recommend the general Tao chicken, the black pepper chicken, the beef and broccoli and I really like the fried squid (though I understand not everyone likes squid.)   Now, I hadn't gone to La Perle in a few years and went last night. The service has horrendous. First off it really feels like they are trying to cram as many people as possible in the restaurant. Secondly, the waiter came, gave us a sheet and said \"fill it in, I'll be back\" and that was it. Our order of beer was forgotten. We got the won ton soup after 20 minutes. The appetizers took an additional 30 minutes. And the main course maybe another 40 after we got the appetizers. We asked for more dishes which were forgotten. We asked for tea which was forgotten. Honestly it just felt like too few waiters, too many clients.   I hope this was a one time incident because the food is really good!"}
{"text":"My favorite dishes are the following:  Beef with black bean sauce  Fried won tons Peanut butter vegetables dumplings Cashew chicken  The one downside is the price. It's pricey and for a family of 4 will cost upwards of $150 for a meal. Depending on how hungry you are and if your all adults it may be worth doing the buffet.   My kids favorite is the shredded crispy chicken (mainly batter in a sweet sauce) I usually don't let them eat any of it till they're done eating and treat it like desert as again - it's mainly batter and very little if at all any chicken."}
{"text":"Ok... Let's be honest. Decor is weird, waiters are sometimes rude and it is definitely not an authentic experience. It's not the healthiest option either...  But it's delicious and sometimes, that's all that matters!!!  Every dish I tried there was good. A lot of fried food... Heavy on both salt and sugar. Nevertheless, it is wonderful for a night of indulgence.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely very tasty and fresh. The service is good but deteriorates if you're a table full of guys trying to out eat each other, which is understandable. This is the proper alternative to an AYCE buffet. PS, paying with cash get youa  5% discount!"}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I think that the food here is pretty good and tasty. From a price point of view, it all depends on how you like to order your food. The soup and rice is charged by the bowl, so as a Chinese family who is ordering a la carte, it isn't necessarily the best deal in town. The portions for a la carte dishes are very decent for sharing though.   However, their all you can eat \"buffet\" option is fantastic for people who want to try a little bit of everything. The concept is essentially the same as an all you can eat sushi place, but it's a Chinese and Thai restaurant. I don't know if the portions are a little smaller on the buffet side to allow you to try more dishes, but for the price, I think it's a wonderful way to have a nice meal out with family or friends.   The ambiance in the restaurant was very nice. The service was extremely speedy."}
{"text":"Il y a maintenant plusieurs années que nous fréquentons ce restaurant. C'est toujours un plaisir d'y manger d'excellents mets, variés accompagnés d'un vin dont la carte est assez bien garnie...Nous y retournons toujours sans hésitation assurés d'un excellent repas....Nous faisons toujours un effort pour ne pas commander plus que ce que nous pouvons manger afin d'éviter le gaspillage."}
