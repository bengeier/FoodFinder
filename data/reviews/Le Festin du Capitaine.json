{"text":"My guy and I were going to Chinatown for dinner and found parking across the street from captains boil. Looked cozy, decided to try it. I ordered shrimp with lotus root, he had clams and a side of oysters.  Tasty but not a fan of the gimmick. Would rather not have my dinner served in a plastic bag. I really like the menu and the flavors,  price is fine but I feel that if they want to stick around proper dinnerware would help. The renovation is great.  Very inviting."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their mussels and Clams.  Make sure you try the Captain Boils sauce as I find it most tasty. 

By the way,  the chicken wings are surprisingly good!  I dipped them in the sauce as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom, both got the lunch special ($10.99) comes with two clams, two shrimps, two muscles, two crawfish, you have a choice of grilled chicken or fried fish (fired fish batter is very good and crispy) also comes with rice. Like all their meals you get the choice of having different seasonings on the seafood and different spice levels. Didn't have to wait long for the food and the staff were really friendly and perfectly bilingual. It's a great introduction into their restaurant and this style of cooking.

Now, there's one thing that I wasn't that big of a fan of and that the the lunch special is a sizzling dish which while not bad, I had one of my crawfish with a partially blackened shell. The dish was also so hot that it took quite a while for it to cool down, but that's not that big of a complaint"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty, but over priced for the restaurant's set up/style.   
Service was spacey as well.  
We had very similar food in Providence/Massachusetts last week and felt it was a superior experience as compared to this."}
{"text":"Food was OK - lobster roll with fries and lobster bisque for lunch, other than the soup being way too hot.
But the arrogance of the waiter when paying the bill turned me off completely.
He offered no change, and said \"all set, right?\" to keep all the change instead of letting me return it as the tip. Never experienced such rude behavior, especially in Montreal."}
{"text":"I would have given 3 stars if it wasn't because of the remarks that the waiters gave to us just when we were about to leave the restaurant today. He thought we didn't understand French when he commented loudly on how cheap we were!!!! We paid very premium price for 1/2 dozen of oysters, 1.5 lb dungenesse crabs, 1 lb mussels, 1 portion of calamari and 3 beer. --- and they commented that we were CHEAP- our waiter's name is Alex. The restaurant was totally empty when we dined in and we were literally the only customers from 6-8 pm. Will definitely NOT come back. Oh BTW we gave tips accordingly."}
{"text":"Disappointed. A very pricey place, the service is not good either. The crawfish way expensive and has only few little bite, and it's not even tasty like all the other dishes."}
{"text":"Ohoh captain boil in Montreal Gg.
Finally another fun restaurant to eat 
And SEAFOOD :-) 
They just opened so they need some adjustment...
Missing some dishes and alcohol...
Ambiance is amazing, decoration number one.
They give you gloves, apron, scissors to play with the food. 
Personally I'd go for some big sea food animal and get dirty. 
Fries are amazing. 
We went for mussels and giant crab. 
Ohoh fun to crack it up and suck the meat out. 
Strongly recommend for a fun date. 
Definitely coming back for a lobster and crawfish."}
{"text":"Omg where do we start, the restaurant looks so nice everything is very clean and nice. The service wzs great the food was amazing but the only bad thin g was that the music was a bit too loud for my liking and the food was a bit pricie but other than that a greta restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food and not one negative thing to say about the service. Alex was our waiter and he was attentive to every detail which made the whole experience memorable. The concept is fun and original, we will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"I first saw Captain's Bowl in Toronto but I never had a chance to try it. Low and behold when it opened in Montreal I was extremely hype to give it a try. I really like seafood but for me this isn't my fav place. I had crab legs which come at 19.95 a pound. I got the captain's mix for the seasoning as well as lotus root which came in the same bag but I believe you can change that flavour if you feel like it. 

I got medium spicy but that only works if you get a crustaceous option. My friend had the chicken with medium heat and almost couldn't eat it. It was so spicy. I didn't love the experience of eating with my hands and I thought it was kind of boring that all the food was the same flavour. 

They do have amazing fries though. 

Overall, I came for the hype and novelty of eating out of a plastic bag but I didn't love the experience. I think I'm going to stick to normal seafood restaurants. XD"}
{"text":"Who needs cutlery ? Dive in and enjoy !
Try the Crabs, shrimps, oysters, lobster and rice.. all great choices. 

Make sure you specify how spicy you want your food. I recommend mild so that spice doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. 
 
Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Le premier restaurant de fruit de mer a mtl. La déco est pas mal cute. Mais on s'est rendu vite compte que c'est juste un mauvais lifting rapide d'un vieux restaurant. Les toilettes n'était pas très propre et la salle à manger est munie de tables minables qui ne restent pas en place. Un bon concept de nourriture, mais qui n'est pas vraiment écologique. Au moment de commander, nous avons quand même reçu un bon service et les serveurs sont accueillants. Plusieurs fruits de mer sont offerts. Nous avions opté pour le king crab, les écrevisses, les crevettes et les palourdes. Grâce aux recommandations de Yelp nous avons choisi la sauce du pêcheur pour tous ces choix avec un épicé moyen. Avec accompagnement de blé d'inde (4mcx), d'okra et lotus. Pour l'alcool, elle était très dispendieuse. 26$ pour un soju. Me semble qu'il en coute 7$ a la saq. C'est plus que 50% de profit. Les bières sont plus abordables. Nous avons reçu notre commande. En première vue, tout semblait epic. Le gout était là. Les écrevisses étaient le plus décevantes. Vraiment pas de chair a manger. Le crabe était le plus gouteux, mais c'était pas donne. À 39,99$ la lbs. On avait seulement une grosse patte. Mais on se régalait quand même. À la suite de quelques morceaux, le gout d'ail commençait à être trop présent. Ca nous taper sur le coeur. Je crois que la sauce constitue d'au moins 30% d'ail. Même le lendemain, le gout d'ail me roulait encore dans la bouche. Pour finir mon opinion. Je crois que c'était une bonne expérience. Je n'y retournerais pas par contre, mais j'ai vécu une expérience première dans ce restaurant. À vous de jugez amateur de fruit de mer."}
{"text":"Myself and some buddies planned a seafood night at the St. Catherine location of Captain's Boil, but changed our mind and decided to check out the newer St. Laurent locale.

First off, the look of the place is amazing, and really sets the tone of the kind of dining experience you're in store for. Your table is equipped with a nice fetching brown paper \"tablecloth\", bibs, plastic gloves, and an entire roll paper towers.

We ordered our food by the pound, and tried two pounds of everything on the menu: clams, mussels, snow crab, shrimp. We also ordered a side of Cajun fries and garlic bread before putting in our seafood order. The seafood was fantastic, cooked perfectly with a nice amount of spiciness. I was a bit underwhelmed that not much of the great sauce was allowed to soak into the meat of the shrimp once you got rid of the shell, but it's a relatively minor complaint. The mussels with \"Fire\" sauce were amazing, and I definitely recommend getting at least two pounds of that stuff.

The sides, however, where very underwhelming. One friend noted \"robbery\" when we saw that the garlic bread was actually just toast slices with garlic butter smeared on and that the Cajun fries tasted like Costco fries with some paprika sprinkled over. In short, don't waste your time with sides and stick to seafood.

Also needs to be mentioned: the service really dipped. The fries we ordered actually didn't show up at our table until we had to ask a different waitress for them. As well, it was a rare occurrence for our waiter to come check up on us, and we sat several minutes with bags filled with the shells of shrimp, crab, and mussels before someone noticed and offered to clean up for us.

Overall, quite a nice dining experience. It's fun to dig in to bags of delicious seafood, deshelling with your hands. While the service tried our patience at times, the great mussels made up for it. We all left there quite happy!"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh seafood! Excellent service and nice resto! Everyone should try this place. :)"}
{"text":"So we left before even ordering. This place was hyped but deserted. The waitress recited a long explanation of how you had to order in a specific way - basically just a big pile of expensive seafood - and then vanished. Everyone ignored us so we left."}
{"text":"Great place to get seafood! The concept is really cool you pick whatever protein you'd like such as crab legs mussels clams even lobster if you have a big paycheck to spend ! Once that's picked you get to choose a flavouring and spice level which means there really is something for everyone ! 

I got to try the mussels clams crab legs and crawfish and would for sure recommend you try all of them. The garlic sauce was amazing too 

The decor is simple and the room is dark probably to hide how messy you'll get, try thIs place out you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"If you need a quick seafood fix the Captain's Boil is a great option. They have a great formal!  1- You pick the type of seafood, the sauce and some sides. 2- They quickly deliver the food in plastic bags and supply you with gloves and a bib. 3- You chow down! 

This is definitely a great spot to come with a group of friends for a low-key and fun meal. And its perfect for sharing. 

Everything we ordered arrived steaming hot and without delay. The service was friendly and the food as advertised. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, and interesting atmosphere! Will definitely be coming again. Take advantage of their 5-a-7!"}
{"text":"It was a less than mediocre & disappointing experience; but my son experienced a different way of eating.  We were provided with gloves; because it is messy.  You may want to roll your sleeves up.  

All of the wait & hostess staff we encountered spoke English, so I was taken aback by the music selections which frequently used words like nigger, pussy, ass, & dick to name a few.  I approached the main counter & made our waiter aware of the disturbance & my dismay.   Upon returning to our table I could see another staff member changing the music on his iPhone.  

My son's review:

The seasoning is mouthwatering; but it was hard to get it on the actual shrimp.  The seasoning is all over the shell of the shrimp, that's why I wouldn't come here again.  The table cloth was a big paper towel. There are these bibs that you wear to keep your clothes clean.  

 This restaurant is good for a snack. I wouldn't recommend it for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"We ordered udon and fried rice for lunch. They literally gave me a lot of rice. The seafood are quite good! It will be better if we can choose the spicy of the rice. Still recommend, though."}
{"text":"Although the food and service are excellent ; especially the king crab, I found this to b a disturbingly non environmentally friendly restaurant!The meal is totally served in plastic bags, plastic tablecloths and gloves to eat the amazing seafood with. This is unacceptable in these times! Could so be improved if served in big steaming pots. I realize that the serving method results in relatively no clean up except to roll up the whole plastic mess and put it in the trash, that will not biodegrade any time soon, this is my only reason for a low rating! The food was great; figure it out and I will come back!"}
{"text":"After missing a Yelp event to try out The Captain's Boil, hubby and I popped in here on a random Monday night for dinner to check out what all the rave reviews were referring to. We were quickly seated and given menus. We decided on fried rice to share, lobster for hubby, and shrimp with a side of corn for me. When the food came, we slapped on our plastic-wear (gloves and bibs) and dug right in. The food was soooo delicious! Messy, yes, but super flavorful. The captains boil seasoning was delicious and the little spicy kick was perfect.

The only negatives are that the price is a touch high for what you get (I think we spent over $70) and that we didn't get adequate tools to break everything apart (lobster tools to be more exact) which got frustrating.

Overall a fun experience and a really cool vibe! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of their other locations in Toronto before and I'd say this one in Montreal lives up to its name! I went there during lunch time and it was not very busy. Service was courteous and the food came super quick. For anyone not used to spicy foods beware of their spiciness scale, I have trouble with even the \"medium\" spicy! Very happy they opened a branch in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I've been to Captains Broil in Toronto and was happy that it finally came to Montréal. The food is good but it's pricey. However, the service is absolute crap. They made 2 major mistakes with our order and we addressed it on the spot (ordered half a dozen oysters they gave us a dozen), the waitress said it was their mistake and since they can't return seafood that it was fine and not to worry about it but it was all a lie. Another waitress came 20 min later after we ate \"the mistake\" and said they are going to charge us for it and it's not their fault. Then they brought us another order we made and also another mistake, they added more than what we ordered and AGAIN we addressed it on the stop and the waitress said no it's okay we won't charge you for this one laughing as she was saying it, which I did not find amusing at all. I'm assuming the owner (who was present) was pissed that they made the mistake and rather than letting us now before we ate it they waited until after to let us know they are going to charge us, even though I told them right when they put the plate down that we did not order a dozen oysters. We didn't want to cause a scene and paid but I will not return there again. 
I guess that's what you get when you're in Chinatown, crap service and lies. I definitely won't recommend that specific location and if you do choose to go please be careful and check your bill before you pay."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there last Tuesday for seafood boil. We arrived quite early (before 18:00) and be seated at a table for four (while we're two). We ordered crawfish, clams and mussels, one pound for each, and a potato (which was sliced into two pieces), two corn cobs (I've gotta say you must have this!) and some okras as sides. As to the flavor and hotness, which you may choose from several options, we chose captain boil and medium, turned out to be a little bit spicy when we almost finished. The service was nice, they changed our plates once when the plates were covered with shells, and they gave us plenty of extra plastic gloves, which helped me a lot from shelling the crawfish. One drawback was that the crawfish was hard to crack and it would be better if they could provide tools rather than using my bare hands. Will recommend to  come back again."}
{"text":"Super bon ! Surtout les crevettes à l'ail, le riz vapeur et les frites ! J'adore le concept de manger dans un sac. J'y retournerais ! Parcontre, le papier essuie-tout est souvent tâché de sauce par les clients avant nous et je ne conseil pas le mojito."}
{"text":"Wow to this seafood place! If you like flavorful and spicy seafood , you have to check it out! Our favorites are snow crab legs and lobsters, so tender and so yummy! Shrimps are good big but not as flavorful as the other two, 100% will return! 
One more thing, I wish they could open a little bit late, like to 11pm , I'll rate 5.5 stars lol"}
{"text":"Looove the mad seafood feasting at this place. The king crab is the best; throw in some corn, potatoes, shrimp and sausage and it makes for a pretty amazing meal. Messy as heylll. The service is friendly and the big booths are cozy. 

Two cons: The music is loud and pretty terrible. And they really gotta do something about the horrendous and unnecessary amount of garbage generated from this meal. There's no need for everything to be disposal. Pay a dishwasher and invest in some plates and bowls to serve this stuff in; the planet doesn't need this shit and, in this day and age, it's ludicrous to operate this way.

But that crab tho! Amazing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very cold atmosphere , waiters whom are totally clueless and over priced frozen seafood, i gave it two chances, hopeless ,no wonder why tables are always empty ,I don't think that they are going to last for long ."}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave reviews, I actually created a Yelp account solely for reviewing this place. It was that great. The food was absolutely delicious! So flavorful, juicy and tender. The waitress was also very sweet :) It was overall a lovely experience and at a decent price! The bill was around 65$ for my bf and I. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"An experience filled with amazing flavor and service! We tried their king crab and 2lbs or captain broil spice clams and they were mind blowing delicious! The crab legs were HUGE and the clams were meaty without sand!!  What we did was deshell the clams and the crab into the plastic bag full of sauce and mixed in a bowl of white steam rice in the bag and it was super flavorful and delicious. The spices were so refreshing and it was excellent with a pitcher of beer. Our waiter, Alex (and other waiters) were superb beyond our expectation. We also tried their friend chicken wings and they were steaming hot and crispy with fresh batter. If you are looking for some good seafood with some spice this is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Terrible location!!the restaurant hours on the door says\"11:30am\"& went there at 11:37 and still closed.So tried calling and was never picked up-when about to leave a chinese old woman opened the door.the waiter seems lost,keep forgetting our order and they don't have half of the order we want!!TORONTO LOCATIONS ARE WAAAAAYY BETTER!!!!Somebody needs to report this restaurant for NOT opening on time!!!!"}
{"text":"It's my first time going, during a Yelp Event for 2017
and it was really memorable.

Seafood lovers rejoice, shrimp and lobster were sublime.
as was the creole style rice and shrimp, okra and all types of crabs.

It gets very messy for me, very fast but it's all in good fun
The staff were super awesome

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Super fun concept and delicious. I wasn't too keen on the King Crab, as the leg barely has any pay-off. One item I will continue to go for is the spicy Cajun Shrimp. Holy goodness! You will not regret it. Although, I wasn't impressed with the crayfish. It was my first time trying it and not only is there barely any meat pay-off at all, but the meat didn't taste good at all."}
{"text":"So happy the first Captain's book is in town. Awesome taste and service. A must go restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"We always try to get seafood while in Montreal and this looked interesting. The name is funny because if you don't know it means boil in the bag to eat food then it takes on a really odd meaning. Service was fine. It was pretty quiet and they gave us a window seat. They were out of crawfish which was too bad as we were looking forward to that. I wasn't a fan of the mussels in the bag. Weird, overwhelming lemon pepper taste and pretty messy to eat. My friend got a spicy plate with shrimp, fried fish, clams and mussels and rice. It was tasty. I didn't find mine good at all though so I probably wouldn't get a boiled in the bag entree again. The restroom was a wreck which is never a good sign. Prices were pretty good - they had lobster and crab dishes at market and the menu was pretty interesting."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars a few weeks ago to L'asie and this place in comparison is much better - very nice decor and service is extremely fast. Throughout the night almost every waiter/waitress who passed by our table checked on us and asked for feedback. Seafood boil tastes great (though quite the same as L'asie or the ones from LA as per our friends). Shrimp is the best option as well as lotus root & okra (surprisingly good).

It still feels strange eating from plastic bags and creating quite a mess. But it's definitely a special experience."}
{"text":"The good thing about this place is that it is open late, until 3 am I think. However, the food is average and the price is high for the quality and level of service. 
If you've every been to a \"boil\" style restaurant, you'll be comfortable here. Essentially, you order your seafood and tailor your seasoning accordingly (spicy, Cajun, etc.) it comes out in a plastic bag steamed and ready to devour after you put on your bibs of course. They have the normal accoutrements (potatoes, corn, fries) to help round off the meal. But the main point is to get down and dirty with your crab, shrimp, crawfish and crack, slurp and dunk in the juices and seasoning spilling onto the table. 
If you're looking for a fun meal, this is probably the ticket, but the servers are a bit absent minded so don't expect a water refill any time soon."}
{"text":"I've long been jealous of similar places in Toronto and Vancouver, and was really, really looking forward to eat tons of seafood with my bare hands. So when my parents came to visit last week, I jumped on the occasion and we all went there for dinner.

It was a Thursday night, but there was only two other occupied tables. We sat down and the waiter kindly explained the menu. Basically, you order by the pound, choose the flavor, then the spiciness level. Add-ons include potatoes, corn, okras, lotus roots, chicken wings, fries, etc. Not sure how much to order, we got a pound each of snow crab, mussels, and clams. We added to it potatoes, corn, lotus roots and okras (one portion each). The veggies seemed quite expensive, but we assumed that the prices reflected the portion size. 

The restaurant is quite well decorated, and the plastic bibs were fun to use. The food came as we were taking photos of each other being silly. My first impression was how delicious the food smelled - then I realised how little we had actually ordered. I didn't realize that one pound of snow crab is basically two sets of legs... I can eat two sets just by myself, so splitting it among three people was going to be awkward. For that price, we would have been much better off buying fresher products and cooking it ourselves. Anyways. The veggies were very good, but also small in portion. They forgot our order of lotus roots. 

It was ok for the service, food quality and novelty aspect. But I wouldn't go back, because spending ~65$ for so little food is insane. I mean, 2.50$ for two potato halves?!? That's the price for 4 pounds of potatoes right now!!"}
{"text":"I tried the mussels with the garlic sauce and heat level fire.
The flavours were really nice and the mussels were huge.
However there weren't many of them in the bag for the price they charged, which is a shame really, mussels are a cheap seafood so normally you'd get a much larger amount.
I don't mind the concept of the plastic bags and gloves at all, so no points are lost on there.
What did bother me is that I almost walked into a lady on the toilet because the bathrooms don't close properly. 
All in all they get 3 stars for now, I hope they take the criticisms to heart because I do like the concept and flavours."}
{"text":"Be careful 15% tip is included I the bill. ????15%????????????

{"text":"Have been there during an event, food is very tasty and service was great. I won't mind foinf back in a day that I would have cravings for crab legs, as it was amazing"}
{"text":"Been here many times, I love their oysters and lunch special! The decor is really nice too! My personal favourite is their lunch menu fish option with medium spice and captains boil mix! Super affordable for the given portion, the rest is a bit pricier."}
{"text":"Today's two star review is based on the location not the food, however I'll give the franchise a quick little intro. I first heard of this place in Toronto, so as myself, for those of you who did not know of their previous locations on the west coast, this restaurant kind of popped up out of nowhere and created a huge hype increasingly fast! 

To briefly describe it, I would call Captain Boils an elevated version of the Red Lobster. The restaurant is Louisiana inspired serving options of seafood favourites in different options of flavours and heat! You sit at a table covered in plastic, provided gloves and plastic bibs and your food comes out in plastic bags which you can order by the pound. I would recommend this place for the seafood lovers who are looking for a fun and casual place to eat seafood at a decent cost!

Montreal recently opened two new locations, one here and one in Chinatown on St-Laurent. I had originally reserved dinner of 12 for my Sister in-laws birthday. The day of, I happened to pass the new location on St-Catherines which appeared more bright and spacious compared to the smaller, darker location in Chinatown.

I walked into an empty restaurant and was quickly greeted by the excited employees who instantly passed me a menu explaining that they had just opened 3 days ago. I advised them of my reservation at the first location and told them I'd be interested in bringing the dinner there instead. The waiter suggested a few tables and then told me he had something better, \"The VIP room\" at the back! Intriguing as it had sound considering the celebration, I took a quick look.

It was all the way at the back of the restaurant and was a private, intimate room surrounded by glass! I thought it was beautiful, but was a bit curious as to how the sound of conversation would be in a glass room. Nevertheless I took it! Excited to show my girlfriend what was planned for her sister, we get there and the groups reaction definitely wasn't what I imagined it would be. 

The floors were dirty with debris from the renovations (Which my sister in laws best friend mentioned earlier to the staff to clean up!) and the back room had a slight scent of garbage which I assume was behind the door that was in the room. The speaker in the room had also stopped working from when I was there earlier so there was absolutely no sound. In addition to this, each of us were echoing every time we spoke. So we end up choosing a table out in the restaurant instead.

We are seated at a new table and my girlfriend decides to order two bottles of wine to start (between 7 of us) as we waited for the others to get there. The waitress comes over and we order two bottles of \"Kim Crawford\", the waitress replies \"I just want to let you know that the price of that bottle is incorrect. It should say $39!\" (Shown on the menu as $22). My girlfriend educates her that by law and also proper customer service etiquette, that whatever price a product is published at should be honoured at that price. After 10 minutes of a blank stare off, she asked the manager and advised us that they will sell the bottles at the price on the menu.

We proceed with the two bottles we ordered, followed by ordering pretty much two of everything on the menu. Once the rest of our guests arrive we attempted to order another 4 bottles and was told by staff that they were \"sold out\" mind you they opened two days ago and haven't had much traffic at all (Said by the employee earlier that day). We then question how they could be sold out already and the waiter explained that's what he was told.

The waitress who had told us the price was incorrect to begin with came over to confirm that they were indeed sold out. Followed by a smart remark from the first waiter \"Look guys we're NOT lying\". Finally the \"manager\" comes to the table (I assume not communicating with the first two) and openly admitted to us that they did have bottles but didn't want to sell anymore to us at the price they honoured earlier.

End of the story food was good, staff need to be educated on customer service and properly trained. With service like this, can definitely ruin a good establishment!"}
{"text":"Nicely cooked seafood. Lobster is nice, with inexpensive price. I recommend the lobster."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday. Kids friendly place but they dont have kids meal. I ordered Shrimp and Fries for them. 
The food is tasty but mostly spicy. Staff are nice and fast serving."}
{"text":"C'est une place pour un souper de groupe.
La bouffe est simple, mais oh combien efficace. 
Goûteuse à souhait. 
Perso, les crevettes avec sauce Cajun...OMG! 
Le service est super! 
Ambiance: les jours de semaine...assez calme.
Prix/qualité: rien à redire!"}
{"text":"Love this Captain's Boil as opposed to the one in Chinatown. The restaurant is clean and spacious; service is extremely fast and friendly, and the seafood is fresh and served super fast. Price is reasonable. We particularly love the shrimps and mussels. Don't be afraid to order Captain's boil sauce at \"fire\" level of spice! We find that that's the best combination of sauce (we tried them all). 

The only thing we like less is that sometimes there are too much garlic in the sauce. The restaurant provides mouthwash in the washroom which we find it pretty considerate.

Overall a great place to grab a quick (and messy) bite."}
{"text":"Smell was so bad couldn't not stay to eat the food. Very unappealing and unappetizing."}
{"text":"Overall my dinner here was a very disappointing experience.

The good: 
This is a nicely decorated casual restaurant and the service is great. The staff was very friendly and efficient and the food was delivered to our table very quickly.

The bad:  
My friends and I found the dishes to be quite mediocre. Two of us ordered the shrimps with Captain's Boil sauce and were disappointed. The sauce tasted good but once you've peeled the shrimps there's basically none of it coating the food so it's pretty bland. The shrimps didn't taste especially fresh either and were difficult to peel with the baggy gloves on. On the other hand, the chicken strips were a lot more flavorful since they're directly bathing in the sauce.

The food isn't cheap either. Expect to pay around $40 for a lobster and the seasonal crab options. Based on my experience, if I were to splurge on lobster or expensive seafood I wouldn't do it here... 

Sorry but even though I live only minutes away, I would not come back here when I'm craving seafood."}
{"text":"Succulent ! Belle expérience :) je conseil les pattes de crabes les crevettes et le mais :) les petites ecrevisse trop difficile à défaire pour la quantité à l'intérieur ! :)"}
{"text":"Good tasty food, the batter of the fish and chips was perfect, the seafood udon was amazing.
The service is impeccable 
Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Tried the crawfish boil and snow crab in Captain's sauce mild. The flavor was good but not what I expected it to be. My benchmark is always 'The Boiling Crab' and they did not measure up. Having said that, the taste of the sauce was unique but it stood out from the seafood. The magic is in the flavor blending well with the food, which was missing.

Service was fine.

Pricing was definitely on the higher side.

Will I return? : Possibly not."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place via a Yelp Elite Event in January 2017 \"Celebration Elite au Festin du Capitaine\" and since that time, I've been there twice.

I'm a big seafood lover so I really like this place. The only thing that I've ordered both times (excluding any side dishes) was the 1 pound of Shrimps in Captain Boil sauce which I selected mildly spicy. The shrimps were full shrimps (with head) so it was somewhat messy to eat (peeling the shell, etc.).

I went to Captain's Boil both times during my lunch and I found service to be relatively quick. However, since it takes me ~15 minutes to get there from where I work and another ~15 minutes to get back to work, even though I found service to be fast, I only went there when I didn't have to work because of the time required for me to go there and to get back to work (and with a limited amount of time for lunch). There were not a lot of people on the days that I went there for lunch.

A lot of the seafood come out in clear plastic bags. This applies to the pound of shrimps that I ordered as well. For one of my visits, I asked them to add a piece of corn in the bag. Both the shrimps and the corn were excellent in the Captain Boil sauce. My only thoughts on the corn is that I was expecting a full corn maybe broken up into 2 or 3 pieces but instead there was only a piece of corn which I would estimate at maybe being 1/3 or 1/4 of the entire corn. You must love garlic if you ask for the Captain Boil sauce but there are other sauces that they offer. In terms of the level of spicy, I found mild to be spicy enough for me. It wasn't at the point that I needed water after every shrimp. 

I found the washroom to be clean and well maintained. The only thing was that I thought that the soap dispenser near the sink table required more soap but they had another soap dispenser near the bathroom wall which had soap in it. They also had some mouthwash in the washroom which is great considering that the Captain Boil sauce had a fair amount of garlic which I liked.

This place is somewhat pricey for a lunch (but probably not for a dinner) and is a great place for sharing bags of different seafood with friends. The thing with their menu is that a lot of the seafood items are marked as \"seasonal pricing\" so if you want to know the price you will need to ask. I asked about the lobster and I was informed that it was $45 and was a fairly large lobster which I'm assuming is about 2 pounds.

Service-wise, I found that the service was okay both times that I was there. They refilled my water during my meal without me having to ask."}
{"text":"The service was really slow. They didn't check up on us we always had to get their attention. It's a messy meal, yet we had to go find napkins. 

Some of the food was good which was nice at least. The beer was cold. Otherwise I don't think we'll ever go again..."}
{"text":"Not as good of a second experience...quite a few of the clams were spoiled and we noticed right away...even though we stopped eating it right away, we still had runny stomach the next day."}
{"text":"Walked by the store after a movie at AMC and decided that the people eating inside looked like they were having a silly good time with their bibs and gloves (the resto front is all glass) so we went in.  

Ordered shrimp with captain's boil seasoning = good choice. Clams with lemon pepper seasoning = not so good choice. The flavor doesn't work with clams.  Ordering crispy fries to dip the captain's boil shrimpy sauce = very good and yummy choice. Crispy coated fries sop up the shrimpy sauce like a sponge! Try it!! Seafood comes in a plastic bag and is served within minutes of ordering. Shrimpy sauce was very oily though...not sure where that oil was from cause shrimps aren't fatty. 

Eating with gloves. Gloves are huge and broke so my fingers were greasy. The only thing is they throw everything out--it's all paper and plastic.  It's a unique experience. Food is served real fast. Servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  The environment is relaxed and nice.  The food is delicious.  We  had lobster with all the spices.  Btw the mild is not that mild! But it was still very tasty.  10/10"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hypes online. 

I went there after my rendezvous and I passed by this place to have a quick lunch. I got udon lunch special with clams and shrimps mix with hot sauce pour on a hot stone plate. It was pretty spicy for my taste... I still manage to enjoy my meal.  

The quality compare to the other one in downtown is the same. Although, the difference is the one on St-catherine is a lot livelier. 

Overall, I gave this place a four stars. I hope they will be more environmentally friendly in the future to get the five stars, although, I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"Tout d'abord, le décor et l'ambiance n'est pas au RDV. Il faut pas aller la pour célébrer un élément spéciale ! Le service est médiocre ! Les explications sur le fonctionnement du menu ne sont pas clairs. La nourriture n'est pas à la hauteur et le prix pour les fruits de mers est trop chers. En plus, c'est tellement salissant qu'il faut porter une bavette et des gants. Quelle déception.... À éviter. Pour les amoureux de poissons fruits de mer , rouler deux heures et aller au Red Lobster à Ottawa."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they dont do half pounds of the seafood, which is already pricey.  If you're with a group it's probably okay. However if youre solo, that can mean a lot (of food and money).

That said, I went for the pound of shrimp in the captain's boil sauce in mild heat(level) which had a lot of kick.  Added to it potatoes  (they gave 2) and corn (half an ear, cheap of them).

It was actually all rather satisfying so I'm glad I didn't add more to it (ie; crab legs). 

The staff was overall cool, enjoyed the music (today's rap) which probably makes for a cool spot on the wknds.

I liked it, but honestly feel I can make a similar meal at home."}
{"text":"I only rate a restaurant/write a review if I think it was 5 stars or 1 star AKA memorable. I will start by saying I had an overall terrific experience here this past weekend. Me and my buddy ordered the following: Shrimp, Crawfish, Clams, Oysters and seafood fried rice. Everything was absolutely delicious. Great sauces! Our server, David, showed us how to crack open the Crawfish and get the meat. Service was excellent! David was extremely nice, funny and helpfull. We were also helped by another staff who's name I did not catch but both were super nice and attentive. The restaurant was very nicely decorated, clean and the bathroom was spotless and had listerine mouthwash and little cups which was a nice touch. The restaurant was playing great music, an excellent playlist for a Saturday night. Had a great time at the Captain's Broil on St-Catherine and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had delivery and ordered crab legs with garlic sauce and the captains mix with shrimp....uhm....seafood wasn't fresh at all and both sauces tasted the same...really expensive !! Also lotus root wasn't cooked so I threw that out. Upgrade your quality please.  It's a waste."}
{"text":"J'étais un peu réticente à l'idée d'aller dîner au Festin du Capitaine, mais au final c'était plutôt une bonne surprise ! 

Le concept est simple : 
1/ On choisi son ou ses fruits de mer (crevettes, crabe des neiges, homard, palourdes, moules, etc.). Tous les choix ne sont pas disponibles en même temps, cela dépend des saisons et de la pêche. On paye à la livre ($13.75 pour 1 livre de crevettes par exemple, $45 pour le crabe Royal). 
2/ On choisi sa sauce (je recommande personnellement la sauce du capitaine, qui est un mix des 3 autres sauces disponibles).
2/ On choisi son intensité de piment. Attention, le \"doux\" pique déjà pas mal et le \"moyen\" est bien pimenté. Le \"en feu\" est recommandé uniquement à ceux qui apprécient se faire des brûlures au 3ème degré au niveau de la bouche. 

Vous pouvez également ajouter des légumes directement dans vos poches (oui, les fruits de mer sont servis dans des sacs en plastique, c'est le concept), et/ou bien prendre des sides (frites, frites de patates douces, etc). 

À la fin de votre repas, la table ne ressemblera à rien et vous aurez probablement plein de sauce sur votre bavoir et sur vos gants (si vous les mettez). Mais c'est le concept, et c'est ça aussi qui est sympa lorsqu'on mange au Festin du Capitaine !"}
{"text":"It was an awesome place for a birthday dinner. We were 20 people and they prepared a table for us in the morning. Some people were late and it was bothering them a little bit but the staff were still really friendly. They helped us for the chairs, the cake and pretty much the whole night. One \"sketchy\" thing they did was..the tips before the taxes in our receipts, which is suspicious and we paid a little more. However, the night was a success, the food was great and the people were really friendly. Thank you Captain's Boil :)"}
{"text":"Food was ok but presentation needs to be revised
Not environment friendly... lots of paper and plastic waste"}
{"text":"Great place to have a blast with family and/or friends. The food is good but expensive for the quality, especially the lobster. The way the serve the seafoods (in plastic bag and plates) doesn't reflect the value of the price we paid. But the best tip, would be to share with more than 2 people."}
{"text":"I came here on my first day of vacation in Montreal with my mother. I ordered clams with the Captain's Boil seasoning and mild heat, which were quite good. She ordered shrimp the same way, which she liked. We also enjoyed the fried calamari and french fries. However, the lychee martinies we ordered tasted cheap and unpleasant. Luckily they replaced mine with some white wine, which wasn't too bad. The plastic cups and paper plates paired with food served in a bag aims for a rustic feel, but comes off somewhat cheap, especially for the price. The service was friendly enough, nothing to brag about though. We waited quite awhile for the check but the food came quickly. 

Quality of service: 3.5

{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff. We ordered the shrimp, clam and snow crab with the captain's sauce and the seafood fried rice. Get ready to dig in! No utensils, put on your bib and gloves and eat away. It was a wonderful experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"We read recipes reviews and ordered the clams and crab instead of the shrimp. It was an amazing experience! Advice: get a bowel of rice. It was a great balance to the salty and spicy!! Our server Alex was a genuine pleasure and super nice and helpful. Thank you for making our trip to montreal memorable :)"}
{"text":"First time I tried the Captain Boil's experience. I ordered Mussels with fries as side. The food is good, the place is nicely decorated in line with their theme, and the service is good. We were a big group of people and they regularly came back to refill our waters.

The problem is, and I'm not sure if it's like that at every location, everything is either disposable paper or plastic. I just felt so wasteful after going there - from the plastic cups with straws, to the paper plates, the plastic utensils, the plastic bags they serve the food in, the plastic bibs and the plastic gloves. I understand that they want to facilitate customers so they don't get dirty, but I could just wash my hands and be done with it. From an eco point of view, it's really not that eco-friendly.. :("}
{"text":"I love seafood and I've already been to another Captain's Boil restaurant on St. Catherine, so it was definitely a solid choice. The concept is great, you get to eat with your hands and their shrimp was so good! The sauce is a perfect combination of spices, if you like cajun/creole mix, then you are definitely going to love it. The service is good and friendly, so if you're looking for a cool place to meet up with friends, then this is an option."}
{"text":"This is my third time to the restaurant, and I'm still not \"wow'ed\". I tried the captain boil sauce and I found it tasted too much like garlic. Their options for alcohol are very limited. They have a bunch of international beers on their bar, but they told us that it wasn't available and it was just \"for show\", so that was a disappointment. We also tried the wings, but they tasted a bit undercooked, so I didn't finish them. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant as there are other similar ones in Montreal that I prefer."}
{"text":"Sans rentrer dans les détails, un service lamentable (incompétants, ne comprenants ni correctement le français ni l'anglais, erreurs de commande, aucune excuses et j'en passe tellement la liste est longue). Snowcrabe pas frais et moules sous la moyenne. 
Environnement bruyant.
Toilettes pas propres. Pas de savon, pas de papier.
Gros problème de management.
Ce qu'on mange ne vaut vraiment pas ce que l'on paye pour.
Pas mauvais mais pour une facture de 100 $, on aura juste 10 fois mieux dans les grands restaurants du Chinatown."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What a surprise!!!! Probably the best seafood festin I had in my life.....everything was good from the clams to the crabs!!!! If you like to be messy with your food...by that I mean eating with your hands and not being afraid too spread all that seafood juice allover you....THIS is the place for you!!! They also give gloves and aprons......white tees not recommanded!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this Captain's Boil few months ago when I was on vacation with my family in Montreal. It was my first time I had Captain's Boil. I always wanted to try this seafood experience, since I saw a similar thing on the Food Network channel which was only available in the states. I was very clueless on how to order because it was my first time, even though I had an idea of what it is really about. The service was great since they were attentive the whole time I was there. They even explained the whole menu to me going through it step by step, I felt like I was learning how to ride a bike all over again . I tried almost everything on the menu, including all the flavours, they had (Cajun, Garlic Sauce, Lemon Pepper and Captain's Boil). On top of that I enjoyed how they had mixed drinks, I had a couple of Mojitos while enjoying all the seafood. This location was very spacious and it even had a VIP area for people to host private parties. When I was there I enjoyed every minute of it maybe because they had good music (EDM), good food, good drinks and good service.

{"text":"It was good experience, but not perfect. Even though the server was helpful but it took him long time to approach the table while it was not even busy. Food was ok. From the whole variety of items we order the best thing was shrimp and fries basket. The biggest disappointment was their special rice that tasted too plain with no flavor added."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I went to here for good seafood -! And this restaurant gives me good seafood! The lobster here is so good, as so fresh. I'll recommend to my friends.5stars"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and have enjoyed it. The crab is good enough and I enjoyed both their regular option (butter and garlic?) and their spicy option. I'm not the hugest fan of the eating technique needed here - hands, plastic gloves - but that comes with the territory. It may even be part of the appeal of the resto's experience... for folks who are less wimpy/lazy than myself. Generally speaking, I recommend."}
