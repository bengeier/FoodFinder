{"text":"Pizza arrived with all toppings slid off of the crust. We payed $30 for a piece of crust with all of the cheese sauce and toppings stuck to the box. When I called to let them know what had happened, the cook said they were too busy and a replacement would take more than 1 hour, which, OK stuff happens. Owner was not there so the cook said he could not give me a refund but would give us $30 credit. I have been calling for over a month and every time I called, \"the owner is not there and we cannot honor that credit\". Today was the last straw. The owner was finally there and said I could get a $5 discount. This is to make up for a $30 order that I did not even receive? (the pizza I received, we tried to re-assemble but it came out terrible and nobody ate it.)    It's too bad, I was a loyal customer here for many years, probably ordered over 50 times since I moved to Newmarket but never again. Worst treatment of a regular customer I have ever experienced in my life. I would understand if I was some raging idiot but I was polite and understanding the entire time.  Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Only had it once and it was just a pepperoni slice fresh out of the oven.  Huge slice, basically 2 slices, tasty and not lacking zest.  Very spicy sauce so the 1 coke almost wasn't enough, could have used a bottle of water after.  Good value as well, a slice and a coke came to $4.20!  pretty good since the slice was huge.  Friendly owner, a small mom and pop place which i like to support.  Not that he's starving for customers.  if you're in Newmarket i recommend Tito's, they deliver as well.  I will say that it is a very spicy sauce but i personally liked that.  i would defianitely order it again for delivery or pick-up, glad i popped in for a slice!"}
{"text":"I'm all about that salty oily cheese on my pizza and this is my favorite pizza in town mostly for that reason. I live super close to here so that helps too but the prices are super good, they have different packages one of which comes with pizza x2, wingsx2lbs, garlic bread with cheese, ceasar salad and drinksx6 for less then 50 bucks... Its a lot of food trust me. Oh yeah get the wings well done too they just get a nicer crisp on them that way.... Eat this!"}
