{"text":"I had a po boy sandwich. And it was delicious. So were the chips. Friendly staff. 5 stars. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce. Got referred here by one of the owners, Nick. Love it! Definitely coming here more than once. Maybe twice."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great atmosphere and decor, superb staff (happy and helpful) and the food was sooo good. Thai iced tea was delicious. Pho dip was really really good! Chips were super addictive! And they do punch cards! I'm excited to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally made the drive out to this highly rated spot this past weekend and the verdict is pretty good! Came in the afternoon and the place was empty but all good for me since it does take a little while for them to make your food nice and fresh which I can appreciate. Ordered the Pho Dip and Szechuan Shrimp Po' Boy sandwiches, both with the homemade chips, and an order of the curry fries. The Pho Dip sandwich was exactly as I had imagined and had that perfect pho flavor when combined with the dip, and although I was a little skeptical about the rareness of the meat, since usually the broth helps cook it when in traditional soup form, I had no (stomach) problems after the fact and would definitely order it again! The Szechuan Shrimp Po' Boy was also very delicious and they don't skimp on the amount of shrimp they stuff in there, I just wish it was a little spicier for my tastes but I do like abnormally hot dishes so no foul there. The side chips were also good, nice and crunchy like they should be, but a little on the greasy side which is expected for homemade fresh chips. And last but not least the curry fries were also very good, the fries still crispy on the outside even after the 20 min drive home! Would like to have had more curry sauce on top but all good anyway.

Gonna come back again the next time I find myself in Henderson. Good eats!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have really good vegan/vegetarian food (my favorite is the Buddha's Delight Wrap) and they're always friendly to me when I go in! I work right next door and they bring it next door to me which is really helpful. I eat here every time I'm in the area, I definitely recommend anyone else to as well!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food delicious - they make Bullet Proof Monk Coffee!!  I had been reading about it, and this was the first place that I could find it in Las Vegas!

Staff was incredibly friendly - just sorry I didn't post this sooner!"}
{"text":"First time at this little deli in Henderson &, I must say, it was very good. Went in for dinner on a weeknight & there was one other couple in the place. We had the clam chowder,  sloppy joe, dragon fries (for additional cost) and the delight wrap. Washed it all down with some Thai tea & we were happy! Definitely a place I would recommend for lunch or dinner. A little spicy with the Asian flare. I will be going back & bringing friends."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches and I love pho, so when I saw the Pho Dip Sandwich on the menu I knew I had to try it. The sandwich came with a side of jus which in this case was pho broth. It was delicious! The complimentary chips were a little greasy, maybe the frying oil wasn't hot enough?  I also wish the broth could have been served at a warmer temperature. I get I'm not actually eating a bowl of pho, but the lukewarm broth took away my enjoyment a little bit.

This is a casual dining environment. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. It looked like they also get a lot of takeout orders. If you're looking a night of dining out but don't want to spend $50, this is a good option."}
{"text":"I saw pictures of the food here from Instagram and decided to try it out. The Japanese Curry Fries looked good, but I wasn't very fond of the taste. To me it didn't taste like Japanese curry. The instant curry from the Asian grocery stores taste better. 

However, no complaints for the Pho Dip. It was filling, the ingredients were fresh, and I wouldn't mind eating it by itself, but dipping it in the pho broth made it even more delicious. I definitely want to come back and try the Dragon Breath Fries and Bibimbap Burrito."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! 
We tried the Kitchen Sink Gumbo and the Pho Dip.  So---sooo soo very very good! 

The gumbo had such great flavor with chunks of spam, oxtail and a nice helping of rice (Jasmine I believe).  Super hearty and great for a cool fall day.  This was listed as a starter on their menu but could easily be your entire lunch.  The flavors were amazing.

The pho dip was beautiful, as well.  The sandwiche was tasty rare beef like a traditional French dip but they added bean sprouts, red onions and surrounded it with a nice baguette.  The dip is a pho broth and the side chips with taro sprinkled with the house made furikake were divine. 

The service was awesome, too.  You can tell these guys have a lot of heart about making great food.  The owners/staff were making the rounds and asking about how we enjoyed everything.

Go here!! Support great local food! I mean really great..fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Delicious; unique flavors.  We live nearby so I came to get takeout for dinner.  I'm glad there's finally something different to choose from around here.  We got curry chicken katsu bowl, which I believe was on special that day, the char siu sandwich and the Thai clam chowder. All were very good.  The soup was my favorite.  I like that the sides are reasonably priced so we could try a couple of things. I can't stand it when some places only have entree portions and prices for apps and sides.  Wanted to try the potato salad too but I couldn't find it in the bag when I got home.  Oh well, I should have checked before I left. I will be back to try it next time!"}
{"text":"Disappointing ar best. The Kaokroke is run by  a set of friends who only allow their friends to sing. When asked for a manager a homely women told me that she knew the owner and I was I shit of luck. As an  old local and now visitor, this is not a place to have fun or a drink."}
{"text":"First time there this past weekend from California....Awesome food. Great staff. Even managed a medical emergency pretty well when a customer collapsed. Called 911 fast.Took care of the customer while waiting for paramedics...
Must try clam chowder soup, chicken wings and dragon fries..Will come back again!!!"}
{"text":"I don't often write yelp reviews but this place deserves all five stars. I've been here a half dozen times and every meal has war rented a five star review. 

It's has unique and creative dishes. It's delicious. The staff is helpful and nice. It's reasonably priced. They have all types of great homemade hot sauces. Fantastic Asian fusion."}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this place after reading the reviews, but sadly I did not have the same experience as some of our fellow yelpers.  I tried the Pho dip with chips and the Thai clam chowder while my husband tried the shrimp curry and the Japanese curry fries with an egg. 

We both loved the Thai clam chowder- it was delicious with great flavor! I will come back for it and to try another sandwich. He also thoroughly enjoyed his shrimp curry just not the size of the entree. The flavor was great though! 

For the not so good...the Pho dip is ok. If you enjoy spicy sandwiches I'm sure it's a little better but I'm not a jalapeño fan. I thought the Pho dip was a great idea, just didn't personally find a lot of flavor in mine. 
Our curry fries were cold. Flat out. I don't understand how you have hot fries and a hot egg with cold cheese under cold curry. The curry had good flavor too it- I'm sure they would be great if it was even lukewarm! 

I am going to return to Buddha Belly Deli but I'm sure it will be solo since my husband was so disappointed. He's definitely pickier than me! There were enough enticing flavors for me to not give up!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but fairly overpriced for the quantity given. The wings are super good, but only get the very spicy if you can take the heat. I also enjoyed the curry katsu, but $12 for the plate was a bit too much..."}
{"text":"We popped in this place to try something new and loved it!! The Thai clam chowder is a must! My husband and I both had the Pho Philly Cheesesteak w/dip and really enjoyed it. Great flavored, really fresh ingredients and the house made sauces are fantastic. Definitely stop in and try it, your bound to find more than one favorite on the menu!"}
{"text":"Asian falafel wrap and shrimp po boy were delicious Tropical green tea was refreshing. Friendly service. Very good new place to come."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Just opened and the food was excellent.   I had the Thai clam chowder and the pho dip sandwich.  The chips that came with the sandwich are retail worthy!!!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I tried this place as I was passing by and wanted something different.  Very happy with the choice. The food is a twist on deli food and very good. The Kim Chi Ketchup has the perfect zing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very unique spin on asian food. Fantastic flavor and excellent portions. I am very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Pho Sandwich, taste exactly like a bowl of Pho. Employees are friendly and give free refills to the Thai Iced Tea :)"}
{"text":"Always amazing costumer service! They had accidentally added meat to my flat bread and I didn't notice until I got back to work, so when I called to ask if they could make a new one they did and delivered it to my work I think that's the most nicest thing someone has ever done in a business! they made my night by doing that! I always recommend them to my co workers and friends! Most yummiest food and excellent costumer service! Thank you Buddha belly deli :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! The Kitchen Sink Gumbo was fit for king. First bite was  an orgasmic explosion in my mouth from the bold flavors. The green tea white chocolate chip was divine and irresistible and it is perfect with coffee to end an awesome meal.  Other items ordered were Thai clam chowder, Char Siu Pork Roll, Sloppy Joe Fries, and Short Rib Red Curry Flatbread and it was delicious, I enjoyed everything. There was a hiccup in my order but it was resolved immediately. Customer service was on point and awesome friendly staff.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for awhile based on all the other favorable Yelp reviews and finally did so today. 
The gentleman behind the counter was great! Big smile, friendly, and very personable. 
After I ordered I went to the 'condiment counter' where there was plentiful water in a glass cooler. I only saw lemon, but it tasted like it might have been flavored with cucumber too. There were 3 sauces as well. I would have liked to have some description of what the sauces were and there may have one, but I didn't see it. I selected one of the greenish sauces to try- It had a good spicy flavor. I look forward to trying the other two next time. 
I got the Schezuan Shrimp Po Boy with Asian slaw on the side. It came with tasty kimchi pickles as well! The slaw is vinegar vs. cream based so it wasn't my favorite, but that's personal taste. It was crisp and obviously fresh, but I think I'll try the chips as my side next time. The Po Boy was delicious. Substantial and filling, but not heavy. 
I love their unique menu and I'm trying to decide how many consecutive days I can go and try different things without creeping out their staff. Plus, those cupcakes look amazing!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!  Finally got over there to try and boy am I a FAN!!  LOVED the shrimp po boy.  Chips were the bomb.  Will be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Super tasty, Service was very friendly.  UNLIMITED THAI TEA!!! omg. Sloppy joe fries .... PHENOMINAL!!!!!  loved it, go there on a empty stomach."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time based on a friend's rec and I couldn't be happier that I tried this restaurant out. First of all the service is awesome with super friendly staff. The menu is interesting and the food is delicious! We got the sloppy joe fries, pork roll and shrimp po-boy. Everything was delish!!!!! Even the home made chips, hot sauces and peach black tea were awesome! Def a to go spot."}
{"text":"The upside down pineapple pound cupcake tasted like Hawaii exploded in my mouth, and I was perfectly ok with that. Also particularly good was the pho dip sandwich - perfectly tender and medium rare beef. Will visit again and again for sure.

Still can't get over those cupcakes."}
{"text":"Walking in we immediately got a warm welcome. The menu is simple but amazing. The chicken katsu club was orgasmically delicious, there really is no other way to describe it. The combination of flavors are indescribable. Also the Thai chili made the club that much better. The customer service was very refreshing. Everybody made sure to check up with us throughout our meal. You truly feel like you are at home. 5 stars all around !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pho sandwich and homemade chips were delicious! Very original menu. Good mix of asian and american flavors. Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"THE ANGELS SANG AND JESUS WEPT! Or if you prefer BUDDHA ASKED FOR SECONDS! This place is crazy good, it actually made me sign up for yelp to write this review (way easier than screaming from the mountain top). I had the Asian chopped vegetable salad and crushed it before I got the chance to snap a pick. It gave my tongue a titty twister, best pile o' vegetables I've had in recent memory. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE seek this place out, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Besides it being unique I didn't care for the pho dip sandwich, the pho dip sauce was bland, the coleslaw wasn't good. I liked the curry clam chowder and that was it."}
{"text":"Place is sooo good!! The Asian fusion/influence is definitely there and it's oh so good!"}
{"text":"My wife was in Vegas for a work trip and stopped by BBD on her way to the airport. She had the Thai clam chowder which came with crostini, the pho dip which came with BBD's homemade chips and pickled cucumbers (like oi kimchi), and ice green tea, brewed on site. She said the Thai clam chowder was amazing - rich flavors and creamy from the coconut milk but not heavy like New England clam chowder, and just the right amount of spicey. The crostini was a great compliment to the chowder - crunchy and savory but not overpowering. The pho dip was also delicious - she ate the whole plate even though she was full. The homemade chips were seasoned with furikake and the pickles had some Korean kochukaru (red pepper flakes) on them. Both great touches. 

She even brought back a second pho dip for me to try - the sandwich held up great despite the flight and multiple cab rides, and really only served to make me want to go and have it fresh myself. It is rare to find fusion food so skillfully woven and even more so to have it be so delicious."}
{"text":"Pho-dip, pho real.  Love it.  Their dragon breath spice is also hella good.  Pair that up with their Yo Mama's sauce and you will be set.  If you intend on becoming a regular, make sure you get their diner's punch in card.  You get a free meal after every 9th purchase.  That's how you build that Buddha belly xD"}
{"text":"pho dip sandwich.. Super delicious especially when you want pho but not a steaming hot bowl of soup during the hot desert summer.


They have scratch made hot sauces, Vietnamese iced coffee & much more

The dragon breath fries will light you up & I love spicy, they have a crazy kick.

The staff is friendly, the food is always fresh & they have a little something for everyone here.

I come here once if not twice a week, it's that good"}
{"text":"Good sandwich. Nice people. Hipster, nice decor. Lots of imagination obviously has gone into this restaurant from the menu to the seating area. My suggestion: a sample plate of their sandwiches since there are so many new twists. Prices were good. Value was worth it. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"This spot has one of the most creative and fun menus I've ever seen!  Can't wait to go back and try everything else.  All the food is made to order and everything, down the the sweet buns are made in house.  Fresh cupcakes had just come out as I walked in, with flavors like hot chocolate and 5 spice with pineapple frosting, it was hard to choose.  I got the Katsu sandwich - what a special cutlet!  something in that breading is seriously addictive and it was perfectly fried, Thai Clam Chowder - LOVE and what a unique soup and the Peach Cobbler Tea Latte - obsessed.  I'm hoping that will make it to the permanent menu.  My girlfriend got the chopped salad which was fresh and the dressing wasn't too heavy - very refreshing.    Lastly, the prices are pretty awesome, considering the amount of love that goes into the food and the quality ingredients they use.  

If you're in the area or even just visiting the Las Vegas- this is a must.

Only downside is I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit. Just as tasty as the 1st!  We ordered the Pho Dip, Char Siu Pork Roll, Sloppy Joe, 9th Island Pizza, and Short Rib Red Curry Flatbread. Our party of 4 wanted to share and taste it all. The items were served rather quickly despite it being busy, the only issue was with the curry flatbread. The pizza oven suddenly crapped out and they (I believe it was the owner Mark, I forgot to ask) offered a free appetizer or drink while we waited, so my cousin got another bottled coke for free.  They were unable to fix the oven so we chose the Chicken Katsu Club (which was brought out quickly after) and they offered to refund that portion of the meal! And we were brought out some free desserts! Now thats how you take care of your customers. Each item has various levels of flavors that work well together, and the fresh chips tossed in furikake are addictive as hell. I didn't provide a review on our 1st visit, but there was no drop in quality or hospitality. I chopped it up a bit with one of the owners/chefs, Ridge, and it's apparent he just has a passion doing what he does. And he's from Hawaii, which explains why he's so chill. Anyway, in our household we say good food is made with love, and there's plenty of it going on here! Keep it up, brah!"}
{"text":"We had the pho dip sandwich, sloppy joe fries, mochiko chicken sandwich, and the chicken katsu club with Thai tea and jones Soda ...Everything was delicious !!! The owners were super friendly !!! A must for locals ... Loved it!"}
{"text":"Kitchen Sink - perfect. Pho Dip - can't miss.  Check it out.  Yelp-ers steered me in the right direction."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was super friendly. I particularly enjoyed the pho dip and the potato chips and the dragon fries. They also had fried brussel sprouts which are my favorite. Overall the menu was innovative and the food was really tasty. I love the asian twist on familiar deli classics. Do not forget to save room for dessert . Those cupcakes are tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is beyond great. I wish that they had this restaurant near my house it was so good! When you first walk in the staff greets you will a smile and welcoming feel. I ordered the Pho Dip Sandwhich, this is one of the smartest invensions I've ever seen food wise. Basically it's pho on a sandwhich. I am a huge fan of pho and I loved this even more. I also got a Thai Iced Tea. This tea was so delicous I drank three glasses of it in one sitting. One of the employees there (I'm guessing the owner) was super kind about getting me more tea when he noticed I needed it. His help definitely made my experience at the restaurant even better. Overall this is a MUST visit for anyone who enjoys thai, is hungry, and is looking for a great experience."}
{"text":"Ate here once when recently opened. The menu was definitely unique and creative, and the staff/owners were hospitable. Hard to revisit because of the niche menu and lack of some \"healthier\" alternatives on the menu."}
{"text":"I was starving and a coworker recommended Buddha belly deli. I had never been here before but, I just took my first bite and fell in love. The staff was so friendly and will most certainly be back every time I'm working. :)"}
{"text":"I had the dip sandwich coleslaw and calm chowder. The chowder was to sweet tasting. A chowder should be creamy but not soupy and sweet. The sandwich which had good reviews didn't taste right either. I wouldn't recommend either. The slaw was from a bag I think with a little sauce. For the $15 I spent and gas to get there was no bargain. I feel I got yelped."}
{"text":"What do I need to say. You cannot go wrong with anything on this menu. I'm very big on costumer service and wow. For not writing down my name and remembering it is great. Over and above on everything and the Hawaiian with all the tattoos is on point. Po-boy and sloppy fires are my favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few days ago.  I thought the food was really good, but it wasnt hot enough.  I got the Pho dip and the best part about pho is the hot broth.  The broth was barley warm.  my fiance got the shrimp po boy, which had great flavorm but again it wasnt warm enough.  We got the thai clam chowder, that was great and it was nice and warm.  The only thing was they served it with to go plastic spoons.  Im being really picky, but it would have been nice to have it with an asian style soup spoon."}
{"text":"We had the Pho Dip(winnahs), bibimbap burrito(dabomb), sloppy Joe fries(addicting), and Thai tea(aight).  Was surprisingly good!  Pho Dip sandwich was like eating the regular pho but more tasty.  Bibimbap burrito had very good marinated short rib meat.  Was winnahs.  

Service was friendly, they played local Hawaii jams too.  We will be back to try more of the menu cause it all looked so good. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Never tried Asian fusion before but I wanna branch out   I read so many great Yelp reviews about this place I had to try it. This is my third visit. I even brought my family and told friends. The chicken salad sandwich and shrimp po boy are amazing. Gonna get the sloppy joe this time. GET THE POTATO SALAD!!!!"}
{"text":"How adorable! So yummy I highly recommend this place. Been in Vegas almost 6 years and this is definitely the best deli I've been to!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wtf did we just eat!? Very poor quality. Everything tasted dirty and masked with garlic."}
{"text":"It's fun to say, isn't it? Go ahead, it just rolls off the tongue... Buddha Belly Deli. Anyway this deli is serving up Asian fusion in the best way. This gem celebrates its grand opening this weekend. They've got a good thing going. I'm excited to return and try more of the menu. 

Pho Dip, where have you been all my life? 

Tender sirloin is shaved thin and piled high on a fresh baguette, it is slathered with Chinese mustard and topped with pickled bean sprouts, onion, cilantro and jalapeno slices ($9). The sandwich is tasty on its own, but the magic really happens when you dip it into the pho au jus. Next time, I'll request extra jalapeno just to kick it up a notch. I like my pho spicy! 

The housemade furikake chips and kimchee pickles were mighty tasty too. They are they extra special something to accompany every sandwich. 

Their Green Tea ($2.50) is freshly brewed and very refreshing. They also surprised me with a yummy green tea brownie. It was moist and not overly sweet, which makes it the perfect treat. Well done, Buddha Belly Deli! Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Oh Em Gee!  I can't even!!!  If only Amazon Prime delivered this to my doorstep with two day shipping.  I'm contemplating buying a drone to fly there from my house, they load it up with the Chicken Katsu sandwich and a Thai Tea, then fly er' on home just so I don't have to move my fat A$$.  However, i'd rather go there and eat so I can see the hot waitress.  Service=Awesome.  Food=Even Better.  Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Awesome concept..a lot of the things are made in house..furikake chips are on point..pho dip was very good..and the service makes this place shine..definitely will be coming back..."}
{"text":"I like trying unique restaurants, and Buddha Belly Deli is one restaurant I would consider good for trying once.

It is decent Asian fusion and does a good job combining ingredients from various East Asian cuisines. However most of the dishes end up being so salty that it's difficult to discern the combination of flavors that the dish intends to bring together. Instead the dishes tend to end up being one salty sandwich.

The Pho Dip uses \"Chinese five spice rubbed top sirloin\" as their meat, but Pho is Vietnamese and they're using Chinese meat (?) (this is from their website, by the way). Anyway, the sandwich tasted alright, but the elevated salt content prevented me from appreciating the different ingredients in the dish.

I'm not sure how Asian fusion is supposed to taste, but I would try Buddha Belly Deli once just for the experience and then probably try something else."}
{"text":"Came in with my father and place was great!!! Definitely something new out there now!! Super great service by staff as well! Recommend any one who is tired of the same food in vegas to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food and staff were both excellent! We had the Dragon's Breath Fries; a nice spicy treat that was great with the kimchi ketchup, Chicken Katsu Club; a nice sweet yet bold sandwich with perfectly crispy chicken, bacon and asian slaw and the Thai Red Curry Flatbread with Chicken; which was pleasantly spicy and rich flavored, it was akin to eating a Tom Kha Gai pizza. Very pleased with our first visit and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous.  The sandwiches are very flavorful and epitomizes Asian fusion.  The pho sandwich was a family favorite. The desserts are also not to be missed. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The service was also great."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service was great and everybody was really friendly. I ordered the Asian Chopped Vegetable Salad and it was amazing. Perfect for a hot desert day! I will definitely come back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"So so yummy! Great selection especially for vegan or gluten free and all delicious! Plus really friendly staff and totally reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I do love this place, I love their food- but there is just one complaint- their potato chips have furikake seasoning and the seasoning is traditionally filled with msg- which they should tell their customers. I love their pho dip but after eating their chips and perhaps the pho broth it's given me migraines due to msg seasonings. Oh well maybe next time."}
{"text":"Im gonna keep this review really brief: Everyone so far has done a really good and detailed job at reviewing BBD and I concur, the place has some tasty food. I've tried most of their food in the three visits in one week i've gone  and there was absolutely nothing I didn't like. I will say that my favorite item does not get as much attention as other items on the menu in the reviews so let me just say their Gumbo rocks!!
Oh yeah, and the Bulletproof Monk Coffee is no joke!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp po boy, it also came with chips sprinkled with furikake. Good sandwich, lots of flavor. Cute restaurant, very clean....nice decor and located right next to Kohls. The girl at the register was very nice. We'll be back. I'm surprised it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Had the thai clam chowder and Asian falafel warp great spices and flavor. Prices were good too. One of the owners worked the counter and was very attentive and helpful. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty freaking delicious. Definitely will be back for more of those dragon breath fries!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm surprised by the friendly service and great food.  I would eat here every day if I wanted a Buddha Belly."}
{"text":"Great little find in sin city. Awesome flavors and very cool menu. Loved the asian hummus wrap!"}
{"text":"Love Budda Belly Deli! Excellent food, great music, amazing host Ridge. I have a full Budda Belly! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time checking out this new spot. Was very impressed. I'm a vegetarian so I'm always wary when trying new places. I had the Buddhas delight and let me say, it lived up to its name!!  My lil bro had the pho-dip and he was full and happy. Will be back for sure. Also, owners were super friendly and kind of goofy which was very niiiice. P"}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli. . .what can I say?

This is my new favorite place. I couldn't be happier. The staff there is extremely welcoming from the moment you step in. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun. Then there is the food. It is perfect. Each sandwich is carefully seasoned and put together. There is a reason for each item on the sandwich. They don't just pick things that everyone would like and serve it to you. No, each ingredient is there to compliment the other. 

The wife and I have already been there a couple of times and I can tell you that we absolutely love the chowder to share. My go to has become the chicken katsu sandwich and she has been ordering the short rib. You can't go wrong with any though. 

The best part, they have amazing desserts! How can one place be so amazing?   I don't know but go there, try everything and hang out with the guys, this place rocks."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA. Inlaws took us here and were pleasantly surprised. They had some great veggie and vegan options. I got one of their chicken specials. The chicken was very fresh and tender. The fried egg and sauces really made the dish.  The slaw was also great. Pleased their Thai ice tea was authentic and they came around for free refills. Strange dining area and atmosphere but food trumps the setting."}
{"text":"We just had lunch here and were extremely impressed! One of the owners, ridge, was super friendly. He came to our table and totally catered to us and made us feel very welcomed. The food came quick and was absolutely delicious. Fresh, flavorful and incredibly yummy!! Great spot for locals and visitors. We will definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"Keeping this short.  The food was just average = PHO sandwich, Flatbread and Soup... The place is dirty. The floors, walls, tables and order# card holder you place on your table... Power wash would be a good idea weekly... No return visit happening here..."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. They put an inventive, modern spin on classic Asian-American dishes. Like their Pho Dip sandwich, their Spicy Oxtail Chili Fries, & their Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy. Everything I've had here has been delish! While their menu might not huge, it's full of gems. They also always have a few unique *Specials* that are sure to intrigue, so your taste buds will never get bored. Yum!"}
{"text":"The place was empty on a Friday night around 730pm but not to worry! Had flatbread and a side of slaw and was very happy. Flatbread was freshly made and the dough was yum, went well with the toppings. I loved the slaw, it was super fresh and had a kick. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I thought it was a bit expensive so I nvr tried it. Today was my bday so I thought why not. Dang I shoulda totally tried it before. SOOO worth it. The food is awesome. Shrimp po boy and dragon fries. I'm so full yet I wouldn't mind eating again haha. The service was so awesome also. Within the hour we were there. He kept checking up on us if everything was good. Probably every 10 min or so. Not to long and not to short of checking. And if we ever needed something eye contact was enough to make em come and ask if we needed something. I will def go back and this place is going to become a reg spot for us."}
{"text":"I have to say that the Buddha Belly deli is one of my favorite places to eat I've been here for 18 years I can honestly say in all that time this is one of the best in town the Thai clam chowder and the kitchen sink gumbo are one of the best I've ever had the FO Dip sandwich is a great replacement for the French dip its got bean sprouts red onion cilantro mustard greens is just unusual and outrageous everything is fresh if you like short ribs try the short ribs red curry flatbread buddha belly deli is a restaurant this town's been missing Thank you Buddha Belly deli."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, if you can handle spicy and garlic the dragon fries are amazing! especially with the kimchi ketchup yum. i got a 9th isle pizza my girl got the ginger scallion flatbread, we both left happy."}
{"text":"I was not very pleased with this place. I tried many of the items on the menu and only liked the pho dip. I would much rather have a bowl of a pho for the price they charge for the pho dip."}
{"text":"BUDDHABELLEHDELLEH ! oh my god LOL i blame Doriee and CD for this LOL 

Lots of hype and talks about this new place on the SE side of town by the 215. some of us went to the lightning ceremony of the Ethel M garden so decided to come here for dinner because 3 of the 5 of us have not tried it yet. Small but interesting menu. Their most popular pho dip is essentially... pho ingredients in a roll with pho soup to dip it in... Only thing you dont get is the noodles ! XD 

I was told their cha siu pork roll was good so i decided to try that. Aside from that, was told their dragon breath fries with ghost chili sauce was amaze-balls. i didnt order this but another did. yeah yeah i know spicy is a pain.. call me a masochist for spiciness if you want haha 

so the cha siu pork roll... marinated pork shoulder, carrot-daikon-jalapeno pickles, asian slaw and hoisin bbq sauce on a sweet roll. ... can i get a pound of that pork shoulder so i can make fried rice or anything with it? the meat was nice and flavorful. tender and sweet. im actually getting hungry while writing this review XD mmmm *drools* OH they also give u 3 containers of various homemade chili sauce. mild medium and hot essentially... lets just say i put some of the hot (its made with ghost chili apparently) into every bite... XD yummy *__* 

dragon breath fries... so its a toss-up on this one. i was told it was fried better last time but it was sauced better this time... inconsistent? dunoe but when we told the worker, they were more than happy to make a new one for us ! we declined because it was fine.. we asked for more spicy ghost chili sauce anyway... 

staff super friendly. simple and clean little restaurant. silly little labels on various things that give you a nice laugh :P 

one of the few places but with growing popularity that offers ghost chili sauce :D if it wasnt so far, id try other things but will leave it in my mind for those occassional trips for my side-job if i go to that area :D"}
{"text":"I went there last week and I thought it was very good. The Pho Dip was very good. The variety of spicy sauce was good. My friend and I ordered the Fried Brussels Sprouts, very good, flavorful, and spicy. I definitely need to go back and try more items on their menus. If you like spicy food, they have the sauce for your. I'm not sure what was all in the hot sauce, but the \"mama\" one was the most flavorful. They have some good stuff."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Drove 20 mins across town and back for what i was sure what going to be good food only to find out the food was wrong. I ordered the French Dip and Shrimp PoBoy for my friend and I only to get home to see a box labeled chix Katsu and Shrimp Po Boy. I was so beyond irritated! People have one job and they cant even do that right. So being stuck with the chix katsu wasnt so bad except the bun was cold and there was tons of mayo! I bite into the sandwhich to see it was Shrimp and i hate shrimp to the point im probably allergic! I give it to my friend who ordered the poboy but hates spicy food but sees jalepenos on it and forgoes the whole sandwhich. My french dip, which was in the shrimp po boy box, was cold , bread cold, meat cold and chips cold. I can make do if its suppose to be a cold sandwich but there was no au jus to dip the sandwhich into. 

We also ordered the sloppy jo fries bc they were great last time and when i ordered she asked \"do you want sloppy jo or curry?\" I specifically said sloppy jo as i dont like the taste of coconut on my fries. We get them and they dont look like what we had last time. They had the shredded meat topped with a curry tasting sauce. Im not sure if its the name which gave me the impression of seeing sloppy joe meat or at least a red sauce but this did not hit the mark. I called them to clarify what the heck i was eating and she didnt have a clear answer and put me on hold and then hung up on me. 

Its not the end of the world but i was unimpressed and so were my friends. After spending $40 bucks we ended up leaving the food for other people to eat and we went to Five Guys. At least their food is hot and they check the orders before giving them to customers."}
{"text":"Interesting delicious flavor combinations. My whole family gobbled up our respective dishes. 

Wifey got a yum vegetarian club sandwich that I want to get next time, it was so flavorful and not vegetarian-like. What I mean is that it wasn't just a boring sandwich with the meat taken out. It was full of flavors and textures. I want one now. 

The younger boys got a pork club they both loved and devoured. 

The surfer dude got a Thai po'boy he loved. 

And I started with an AMAZING thai clam chowder, really the best chowder I've ever had. My only complaint is that it wasn't triple the size so that I could take some home for two or three more meals. I also got the fries which came with a spicy tangy sauce, all gone. My entrée was the special, a chicken curry, yummy, but I was hoping for more wow.

We all got their home-made chips, very moist and very flavorful, definitely not from a bag, ate 'em all gone. 

In protest for being required to spend time with his family, grumpy hormonal teenager #1Son ordered just chips & slaw, but ended up nibbling everyone else's cuz he was hungry and it was all so good. 

My wife, who is a much more stern critic than I, said \"five stars for the cleanliness, the cheerful attentive staff, the creative flavors, the vegetarian options\", and the fact that it's five minutes from our house is a bonus. 

Definitely would come back with my whole family, or alone. 

The \"$$\" rating is fair, as it cost us $65 feeding 5 fully (and #1 Son Grumpy only got two sides) with no drinks, before tip.

The decor is cozy cafeteria, not institutional, walls paneled in lovely bamboo."}
{"text":"So this was my 3rd visit...I love their little sweet treats. Always got something new for my sweet tooth. Also, I tried a special today, the savory seafood cheesecake served with a finger-licking good sauce. Today I tried these coconut Meringue Balls...mmmm. Just upped their star rating to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The Pho dip sandwich here is AMAZING! Came to this place with my friend to just try something new and now every time I come to Vegas I have to try it! 

Their cold brew coffee and black mango tea is also really delicious. 

The service here is always really good and I love that it's really close by to grab a yummy sandwich and some coffee for the day."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, where do I start? Thanks to the amazing Yelp reviews, my bestie and I had to try this place out on our lunch break. We were so glad we did! With BBD being a mere 4 minutes away from our office, this will now be our Friday lunch hangout. 

**Tip** If you have a 30 minute lunch, it would be best to order ahead, as the food does take a little time to come out.

The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect. Red walls with hanging lanterns and Buddha decorations, super cute. 

There is a Jones soda fountain machine, which is exciting enough.

I ordered the Pho Dip sandwich which is literally pho on bread! The beef was delicious and perfectly seasoned. With bean sprouts, jalapenos, a delicious mustard type sauce, and yummy pho broth for dipping. I got the dragon breath fries as my side, perfect blend of garlic and chili, delish!

My friend got the sloppy joe fries which are red curry short ribs and cheese on top of shoestring fries. I tried one and yes, amazing.

We will definitely be back here weekly, if not more, to knock out everything on the menu. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars, wish there was an option to give more stars."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Love this place and definitely frequent here!  There isn't anything I haven't liked from this menu. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Amazing fusion. Greta prices. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Been here a lot.  Pho-dip is the favorite.  Shrimp Po-boy is ok...but it looks like they added wings.  Korean wings I believe...and they were excellent!  Eat Coast Eats was a fav at this location, but this is a great substitute.  Will go to both if ECE opens at another location."}
{"text":"Loved it!!  I had a burrito I couldn't pronounce but that didn't deter me from trying.  Glad I did!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I tried this place about a month or so ago and recently I've started going after I get off work on the weekends.
The staff is friendly and the food is an amazing twist on east meets west. I really love the Japanese curry fries with egg and the pho dip 8,) but the flat breads are really good too!
Highly recommend going here if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"First visit and I can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu. We ordered the wings, katsu club, and sloppy joe fries.

Wings are flavorful, you must try! 

Sloppy joe fries were delicious 

Love the way the chicken katsu is breaded on the club"}
{"text":"Torn between four and five stars, so I'll bump it to five.  Wished I had tried this place sooner.   Interesting concept.  Good food.  Very good service.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"FINALLY made it in to try the famous pho dip sandwich and the shrimp po'boy. Heads up that this place is closed on Fridays- crossed town twice on that unlucky day before finally swinging in for lunch with my guy.

The Pho Dip sandwich is the star of the menu, and for good reason: it's thick with meat, perfectly balanced with the right amount of veggies, and the genius bowl of pho au jus for dipping makes the whole thing magic. Add in the house-made furikake chips and you're set for a giant meal you won't want to share.

But if you aren't flying solo, I suggest splitting the Szechuan shrimp po-boy as well: it's a great value with tons of crispy shrimp and a great spicy mayo on a fresh baguette. It's simplicity is perfect.

If you're really feelin' dangerous, try the Bulletproof Monk coffee- AKA coffee blended with butter and oil for a long-lasting energy buzz and proported fat-burning benefits. It's part of the keto diet, if you're into that sort of thing. 

Service is friendly, menu has many other tasty-sounding items (flatbreads, salads, dragon-breath fries?!), and the simple, clean restaurant is the perfect showcase to allow their tasty food to be the star. Love the Buddha beer bamboo plants- might have to snag one next time I go in! ;)"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, but had put it in the back of my mind...then, one night driving around with the wife looking for a place to have dinner (just happened to be Valentines Day, I know, romantic right?). \"Wanna try Buddha Belly Deli?\" I asked. \"Sure, you think it's open?\" She said. Love that girl, she's down for anything.

Located just off the 215 at Valle Verde, right next to Kohls...walked in, the smells wafting from the kitchen were wonderful. I knew it would be okay...first thing I noticed was that they had baked goods on display next to counter, exotic cupcakes, mochi (mmmm, mochi!, maybe later), etc..I wanted to order everything on the menu, but settled on the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy. My wife  got the Asian BBQ flatbread...as we also ordered the fries smothered with Japanese curry, the guy behind the counter asked if I wanted to add an fried egg to that...hellz yeah I wanna fried egg on that!

Didn't have to wait too long for our food, the curry fries with the egg on it was a thing of beauty and just as delicious (broke the yolk over the curry, a magical mess). The curry was nice and thick, so the fries didn't get soggy. The po-boy was legit, no skimping on the shrimp. The bread had a good crunch, the furikake potato chips were awesome and the pickles too. My wife thought the flatbread was just okay, she said she should've gotten the Pho Dip sandwich...maybe next time.

Overall, a great meal...so, if you're open to a cool and delicious Asian style mashup of your favorite sandwiches, please check out Buddha Belly Deli."}
{"text":"Bimibap burrito was lukewarm. Rice wasn't that warm, which made tough to enjoy. Creative asian flavors though. Style of service you order at the counter."}
{"text":"I am for sure going back. Food was great and people are extremely nice. I had the Sloppy Joe Fries with a egg on top. I recommend that and also the 9th island pizza, basically a Hawaiian pizza with pepperoni on it but it's done on flat bread. It's not a big menu but that shows they take the time to make the stuff they do have great. The place is a must try."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place. Awesome menu with a lot of options to choose from. Weather you're in the area on not it's worth a try. 

I went with the overwhelming yelp favorite the Pho Dip. Spin on your traditional French dip just done in pho with jalepeno and pickles sprouts. Awesome concept and sandwhiches. Also try the 9th Island potato salad. 

Side note: staff is super friendly.

In the words of Schwarzenegger \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"*4.5
Awesome service, good prices. I loved the Thai Clam Chowder and Dragon Breath Fries :)"}
{"text":"When you see a place that is highly rated on Yelp, you get high expectations of them. When you have high expectations, you're almost always disappointed that they're not as magical as everyone promised.

This place was still magical. Stunning, I know.. nobody was more shocked than I was! I'm a mean reviewer.. I may not be a chef but I don't hesitate to deduct points for failures or outright bad food. But this place.. the only flaw is that they're so far from my house so I won't be there more often.

Why this place was empty, even at 4pm on a weekday, is totally beyond me. Granted, there's not a lot of parking and handicapped access is far away from their door, but this place is worth the extra effort.

Now, for the food.. Hubby got the Sloppy Joe sandwich with a side of Thai Cole Slaw, liked them both a lot.. then he added some of the cilantro schmear to his sandwich and started crying tears of joy.. okay, only metaphorically, but he did rhapsodize a bit over it.  I tried it without the schmear (not a cilantro fan) and it was very good.

I got the Pho Dip sandwich with a side of their chips - loved them both. The sandwich was huge (so was hubby's, btw) and had a nice balance of ingredients in it - it was good enough without the pho dip. However, when I dipped it, it became something different but also excellent. I varied between eating it both ways, it was like eating two different but similar sandwiches. The chips are homemade, which is rarely a good thing, and they were excellent. They're also good dipped in the Pho broth ;)

Even their pickle garnish was tasty.  I'm a sucker for pickled stuff (the sandwich had pickled sprouts on it!!!!) and this place definitely won me over."}
{"text":"I was really impressed while dining here for their soft opening.  

We were coming here for their Pho Dip Sandwich but unfortunately they ran out.  And although I was bummed I browsed over the menu and actually found it hard to decide since all the selections sounded good. 

I decided to try their Chicken Salad Sandwich with dry cherries and walnuts and my husband tried the Char Siu Roll.  We also got to sample their soup of the day which was Clam Chowder.

I believe their concept of serving their food with a twist really works.   My Chicken Salad Sandwich was more on a take of the Hawaiian/Chinese dish~ Cold Ginger Chicken. The walnuts and cherries were a great touch making this an amazing tasting sandwich.  This also came with their delicious thinly sliced taro and potato chips dusted with Furikake made in house with a side their Kimchi pickles. I seriously think they should think about selling jars of these pickles and bags of their chips! Addicting! 

Now the Clam Chowder soup served with toasted crostini was incredibly delicious with a Thai twist.   It had the right amount of heat, clams, potatoes, and Thai influences.  It was not thick but more of a broth.   I joked with the owner that this had to become a regular and not a special, but I was really serious!   I know I am going to be craving this soon and would love to see this on their regular menu. 

We finished with a delicious and generous dessert offering of their Pumpkin Crunch and Red Velvet Macarons with Honey Butter. Both delicious but with the fall approaching, that Pumpkin Crunch is going to be a hit!.

The place is nicely decorated with a modern touch of bamboo, red and gold, and the tables are nicely touched by a Buddha vase (once served as a Buddha alcoholic drink) with a bamboo.  They also offer complimentary lemon infused water which is a pleasant touch. 

The food offerings are delicious, the pricing is fair and the service was splendid, making for an amazing dining experience and great first impression.  Can't wait to return to try more of their menu as I can easily see myself becoming a regular patron"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Great service!!  If you like spicy food, then this is your place!!  Great flavors and innovative asian fusion dishes and yummy cupcakes!!  Definitely a great place to stop for a bite!!"}
{"text":"Asian sandwich done right... seriously. And no, it's not just bánh mì.

- Pho Dip
- Thai Clam Chowder
- Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy

These guys nailed it... I never expected fusion stuff to be this great, as if it had been traditionally so. Totally impressed!"}
{"text":"Great new place.   My wife and I tried the Pho Dip and the Shrimp Po Boy.   I couldn't decide which I liked better.  Both were tasty.  Their sandwiches come with sides also.   We got the Asian slaw and their homemade furikake chips.   Both were excellent.   We look forward to trying their other items in the future."}
{"text":"Asian fusion and close to home- Win Win!

It's very easy to find off of the 215 by Kohls.  I walked in being greeted immediately.  I had a lovely conversation while trying to decide on which delicious option I wanted to try.  They have a great menu with a variety of sandwiches, flatbreads and sides.  Their service was good! All were very friendly and professional.  

I chose the Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy.  The shrimp was full of flavor with the great spicy Szechuan zing! I loved it! It's hard to top the main part of my meal but I ordered a side of the Dragon Breath Fries.  Yum!  A combination of garlic and a spicy pepper sauce earned my definite approval. You really won't want to kiss anyone after eating those and they will keep away vampires.  

I'm excited to come back and try more of their creations.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that can do the food Justice?  Words like \"incredible\", \"mouth-watering\", and \"exquisite\" comes to mind.  But really you just need to go try it.  You haven't lived until you have had their Thai clam chowder and dipped fries in the various spicy sauces they carry.  Kimchee ketchup?  Seriously?  But it's great.  Go.  Eat.  You can thank me afterwords."}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli has taken over East Coast Eats on Valle Verde and the 215.. and honestly I can't be mad because this has now become one of my go-to places for lunch, since it's 5 mins away from work!

An Asian-fusion, Thai-twist on soups, sandwiches, and salads!

Few things I've had and tried :
\"Bullet Proof Monk\" Coffee - has the strong coffee taste, benefits are : fat burner, increased focus and prolonged energy.

Green Tea Cookies - I'm a sucker for anything green tea AND soft baked cookies!

House Made Chips - potato chips seasoned with furikake, a bit on the greasy side - comes with sandwiches or a side by itself. 

Thai Clam Chowder - creamy, wasn't too rich, and seasoned just right.

\"Pho Dip\" - beef, pickled veggies, cilantro, and onion all in a baguette, served with pho au jus. Au jus was salty enough to season the whole sandwich, which I felt could've used a little more seasoning.

Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy - shrimp, with spicy Szechuan  mayo, and veggies served in a baguette. A little too spicy for me, because I don't take spice very well ; the shrimps are a great size ; it was good but not for me.

Chicken Katsu Club - chicken katsu, bacon, lettuce, tomato and instead of katsu sauce I asked to substitute it with the house dressing (which is to die for!) - all in a sweet roll! 

AND MY ALL  TIME FAVORITE and always keep coming back for :

Chicken Katsu Cobb Salad - chicken katsu, lettuce, bacon, egg, and cucumber with their house dressing! Similar to the katsu club but in salad form, same great taste but less regretful. I can't figure out what exactly is in the dressing but it goes so well with everything in the salad! 

Everyone is super friendly and helpful every time I come in.
They offer punch cards, which I think is something fun and playful for their regulars, after 9 purchases, 10th one is free.99!"}
{"text":"This place was far, but definitely worth the drive. I heard they had sandwiches that you dip in pho & I just thought that was such an interesting concept and I had to try it. I ordered the \"pho dip\" and it came with a vietnamese style sandwich, pho broth to dip your sandwich in, and chips. There was so much flavor in each bite of my sandwich, but it wasn't too much. They also have different hot sauces. The green one is SO GOOD! They also have one called \"Bad Karma,\" but you have to ask for it. It's crazy hot, so beware! I also tried their fries that were seasoned very well. Aside from the delicious food, the service was exceptional. I think the guy at the register might've been the owner. He was very helpful with the menu and he made sure my friends and I were taken care of. This place is super cute. Cute/funny pictures hung on the wall. Awesome place! Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Asian Fusion comfort food with a trendy twist! That's what I tell everyone! This fairly new place has come along nicely ever since I came on the 2nd day they were open 30 days ago. So here's my lil update.
 
All the fusion going on all their menu items are no joke! Clam Chowder has a Thai spin, Sloppy Joe with red curry instead of bbq sauce. THE PHO DIP!!! Pho broth for the au ju! Pho- NOMeNAL !  Authentic Thai cooking too. It's one of those places that almost everything on the menu tastes crazy good!  I still have yet to get to try the Gumbo!

I think I mentioned already a lot of menu items made from scratch. The Furikake seasoned potato and taro chips, their own sauces and hot sauces; Green Monster, Ghost Pepper, Thai Chili.. Their own breads! Are they crazy?? (umm...yes!) Hats off to them for pulling it off!

The dessert case is full of some creative treats that aren't served anywhere in Hendo that I know of. Like the Five Spice Carrot Cake Cupcake w/Ginger Buttercream frosting. The most moist cupcake ..ever.  Addicted to Mochi too!! So BUTTERY! So Good! Pumpkin Crunch..ONOLICIOUS! The prices are super reasonable. Better take advantage of it because anything put out flies out like hotcakes!
 
They got this coffee contraption in and they cold brew up some good coffee for Bullet Proof Monk Coffee now. Grassfed Butter, it's the healthy fats...just ask Don, he's the guru of coffee here.

They replaced the banner with a lighted sign on their storefront. So you could see it now coming off 215/Valle Verde exit. 

They now offer  ---STAMP CARD ---Your frequent visits are rewarded with any sandwich, flatbread or salad on the menu on your 10th visit!  I redeemed my first filled card the other day!! So dont forget to pick up one at the register!

Clint, Don, Mark and Ridge and crew are top notch and at the top of their game!  BBD should stand for Bonafide Brilliant Dudes! 

Great food, drinks, and dessert all offered in one place. BAM! Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu and selections. Food and service is consistently good. Love the pho French dip."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon BBD after arguing with my best friend about where we should have lunch. She's always in the mood for Asian and I'm always in the mood for American so we met halfway with Asian Fusion.

The service was friendly from the moment we walked in. At one point, even the cook came and asked us how everything was tasting, which doesn't happen often. 

I ordered the Chicken Katsu club and it was delicious. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their selections. Meals come with a side of coleslaw or house made chips. All of us chose chips. We weren't impressed: the chips were cold and are covered in seaweed flakes and have a pretty strong and fishy taste. We couldn't finish them. Also, we all paid for drinks and it would have been nice if the cashier would have told us that water was free. I feel a little ripped off, but water was all I could drink. We tried their tea, but it smelled rancid: definitely not fresh and it almost ruined my entire meal.

I feel bad for giving a highly rated place a low review, but I was just not wowed. Their was only one other person in the restaurant at the time we were there, so there's no excuse they couldn't keep things fresh. I'm just a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli is an absolute one of a kind restaurant. Sandwiches, flatbreads, wraps, entrees, salads, vegan options, coffees, and even unique desserts, all with a Thai twist, but this is all still very familiar fare. One of the only restaurants like this anywhere, in any city, and i couldnt be more thankful to have this gem a mile away from my house."}

{"text":"5 stars isn't enough for Buddha Belly Deli! It is by far amazing! Everything is soooo good!! Not only the food but the service is great! Everyone is so sweet and friendly. Love this place! Got myself a punch card, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Upon entering the deli, I was surprised to see so many causasians at the register and kitchen. I really thought it would be run by Asians. Not that it mattered, just surprising haha. The menu is really simple and you can always ask the guy at the register if you have any questions. I wasn't sure what to get, so I asked what was the most popular - the pho dip sandwich comes in first and then the char sui pork roll came in second. They also have a variety of drinks. They had thai tea, vietnamese coffee, but no boba! sad face. They also had something called dragon breath fries haha

My boyfriend had the pho dip sandwich. It came out with potato chips and they tasted somewhat sweet. It had black and white seasoning on it and I am not sure what it was. It comes with a tiny bowl of hot pho. I am not really a fan of pho unless it's made by one of my really good friends, but this sandwich was pretty good. You get a sandwich and dip it in the pho soup. Interesting concept but good. 

I had the char sui pork roll. The sandwich came with thin layers of char siu pork and diakon type relish on the inside. It was pretty good, and it too, came with the potato chips with the mysterious seasoning. 

The last thing we got was the dragon breath fries. On the menu, it advises you that you should not get this if you're on a first date. I agree - these fries contain a shiz ton of garlic and chili peppers. They're somewhat spicy but not too bad. They also come with a kimchi ketchup concauction that is actually pretty good. 

You have to ask for some sauces - like ghost chili pepper and green chili pepper. I dared my boyfriend to take a spoonful of the ghost chili pepper LMAO

The only reason I am giving four stars is because of the drinks. The vietnamese coffee was really not good :X Other than this, I would come here again for the food."}
{"text":"Just Buddha-ful!!! The best guys in town servin up Yummylicious creative delights including dragon breath fries, korean spicy wings, green tea cookies, and creative cupcakes like banana with maple frosting and chocolate covered bacon, what?!!! Feed my belly!!!"}
{"text":"Pho Dip and Szechuan Shrimp sandwiches are to die for. The curry fries with egg (of course you get the egg) are amazing!"}
{"text":"We drove to the East side to check this new Deli out.  We ordered the Char Sui Pork Roll, Pho Dip, 9th Island potato salad, chips, and iced tea.  Both of the sandwiches were great and we agreed that we would order them again.  The potato salad is okay but would be better if you could order it without the Spam Chunks.  I know people love Spam...it's just not my thing.  I didn't care for the iced tea so I wouldn't order that again.  

Very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Great flavor, great atmosphere! Had the chicken bacon sandwich with the slaw side, DELICIOUS! Glad I tried it. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and they seemed a little mixed but after looking at some of the food pics. . .especially the ghost chili sauce, I had to try this place. :)

yes I am a chili head. I love me some spicy food.  my food philosophy is....spicier the better.  :)

so they got 1 star for just having the sauce.  they call it the bad karma sauce and they only keep it in the back now. you have to request it from the person taking your order. apparently a lot of ppl wasted the sauce by trying it and throwing it out since they could not handle it. . . .boo!!  no wasting the yummy sauce!!!  lol :) btw the sauce was delicious.  if u think that a thai chili is spicy....dont waste your taste buds on this. ..if u think habanero is just right u might want to try this.  it was really well balanced. it had hints of sweetness and citrus to balance out the heat of the ghost chili and the scorpion chili that it is made from.  totally made my day. :)

onto the food...
On the reccomendation of the person taking my order, I ordered the thai clam chowder.  it was not as thick as a normal new england clam chowder. . .it was a little on the watery side but it was still very flavorful.  it had chunks of potato and clams in it and with hints of lemongrass running through it all with creaminess from the cococnut milk all worked wonderfully with the bad karma sauce to give me a very flavorful bite.

I also ordered the asian bbq flatbread.  I love chinese sausage and jalapeños.   It was good with a hint of sweetness from the asian bbq sauce on it but there just wasn't enough chinese sausage. =/  the bites that I had wiith the chinese sausage were delicious...total 5 stars. ...but the rest of the flatbread with no chinese sausage was just that a flat bread with cheese.  kind of disappointing.  dont get me wrong it was good flatbread....but without the chinese sausage it was just flat bread.  

my bf got the chicken katsu club sandwich....he gave it a solid 4/5 stars.  i had piece of the bacon off of the sandiwch and it was thick cut and not too salty like a lot of bacon can be.  he also the house made chips in furikake and it was delicious!!! perfectly crispy!!  I could've eaten a whole plate of these.  

overall with the service and the quailty of food that I got....I had to give them 4 stars.  I am looking foward to coming back and trying more items.  everything on the menu looked delicious.  I just hope that the asian flavor is more pronounced in their other menu items."}

The food is delicious and true to their flavors. What really grabbed my attention was the exceptional customer service from the entire staff. Great place and I'll be returning."}
{"text":"They offer vegan food, good vegan food! Best food I've tasted in Vegas in a while, let's support our small businesses!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches taste great. The pho dip is very flavorful and the meat is rare and comes with crunchy bean sprouts.The Sezchuan shrimp po boy is my favorite. The spicy mayonnaise goes great with the crispy shrimp. Thai clam chowder is pretty good, it's a little spicy and not as thick as regular clam chowder.

I am not a big fan of the sides I tried. The dragons breath fries were kinda soggy and I though they could've been spicier. The chips that come with the sandwiches are soft and soggy also. 

The restaurant is very clean. Staff is very polite. There's several different hot sauces for you to try.

There's a punch card you can get. You get stamps for buying sandwiches, salads or flat breads. The 10th one is free."}

I definitely do not like seafood but the chowder was soooo good!! The dragon fries..spicy and I couldn't stop eating them even though my mouth was on fire. And, the pho sandwich dip...ohhh emm gee!!!!! 

You must try this place asap!! If you dine in, the employees are all friendly!"}

I'm in the industry, I understand mistakes happen, maybe throw in the cupcake or cookie I ordered. Other than that good food, girl was polite."}
{"text":"Second time here, first time was great and that is what brought me back with my parents and son.  I had the bim bim bap burrito again, as I did the first time and this time it was not good.  The rice was mushy, the kim chee was only on one half of the burrito, so much where it made the tortilla wet and soggy and the kim chee juice was dripping and puddling on my plate and the other half did not have one little piece of kim chee at all.  The meat was very tasty except for one half (the same half that did not get the kim chee), the meat must have been the ends because there were pieces that were so hard, I thought it was a bone that I bit into.  The chips that came with our burrito and sandwiches were inconsistent.  Mine were light and crispy, my dad's and son's were soggy like it was sitting at the bottom of a bowl in oil.  My dad held up one of his chips and it flopped over. We also had the chicken katsu sandwich, the pho dip and the chicken wings which were all very tasty and worth coming back for however, after my disappointing burrito and soggy chips I think I'll see what other restaurants we can explore. Sorry..."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday.  The short rib red curry flatbread was good, but not as great as reviews I've seen.  My main disappointment was the Vietnamese iced coffee...which I love...but this was bad, very weak and not sweet.  The exact opposite of good Vietnamese iced coffee.  The restaurant itself was nice and an interesting menu.  I may try again."}
{"text":"It's a nice little change of pace for the area. 

I saw the reviews on Yelp and I figured we'd give it a try while we waited for an appointment. 

This was our first time and neither had looked at the menu before the visit. 

Thankfully there was a chicken katsu sandwich on the menu, as the boy is fairly picky and there wasn't anything else he would have tried. We both ended up with the katsu sandwich. 

The cut of chicken was very generous. They cut it in half and stack it on the roll. I ended up taking half of mine out as there was no way I could get my mouth that wide (about 2 1/2 weeks post tonsillectomy - not an option!). 

Personally, I thought it was a bit bland on flavor, not very much katsu sauce and the sweetness of the roll overpowered any other flavors trying to come out. 

I'm also not a big fan of flavored water and didn't think to ask if there was anything else. The water they had available was cucumber water. 

Overall, it wasn't a horrible experience. The staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is welcoming and cozy, although a bit chilly - which is apparently my luck this week. 

We'd go back, it's just not on my \"Oh my God, this is fantastic!\" list..."}
{"text":"Restaurant quality food in a fast casual setting and great price.

This town is full of cookie cutter venues ... they aren't bad but they are all the same. The flavors here are genuinely unique ... highlighted by their array of homemade sauces, I recommend getting all of them and trying them with whatever dishes you decide on. 

Shrimp po'boy had the best portion of meat I have seen on any sandwhich in the city and was delicious. 

As expected the Thai Red Curry Flatbread did not disappoint ... yes it is an easy dish to get right but the execution was a step above what you usually get for that price. This could easily be served in a sitdown environment for twice as much. 

For vegetarians the Asian Falafel Wrap was a filling and complex option (doesn't feel like veggie food). If you like peanut sauce I'd ask for an extra side, otherwise the happy buddha sauce (which has mango in it) provides another unique twist on the dish ... it comes out a little dry for my taste but I am a sauce person. 
 
Oh, and we capped it off with a coconut mochi handmade by the owner's wife ... it was amazing and that is coming from someone who generally doesn't care for mochi.

I wish this was in my neighborhood, I would be here all the time ... but its worth the drive from wherever you are!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been so inspired by a restaurant that I felt it necessary to write a review immediately after returning from my first visit. As you can see by all the glowing reviews so far, the Buddha Belly Deli is well on it's way to becoming a success story. I foresee this restaurant as having the uniqueness necessary to become one of the places that tourists come to for an \"off the strip\" experience. I also predict it to climb the charts in the Yelp list of top restaurants in Vegas/Henderson amongst the likes of The Sparklings and Soho Japanese. I was one of the first few customers of those restaurants when they were new and it's clear to me that Buddha Belly Deli has that certain \"je ne sais quoi\" that those other restaurants did. So mark my words here. This restaurant is definitely a keeper and if you haven't been yet, you should definitely cross it off your to-do list. Get to it!

Enough about me singing Buddha's praises, let's talk about the food. I tried the top three items that all the trailblazer yelpers before me recommended and I was a fan of all three of them.

I started with the Thai Clam Chowder. Such an ingenious idea to merge an American classic with Tom Kha soup. Good stuff!

Then I moved on to the \"Pho Dip\" which is a Vietnamese spin on the classic French Dip sandwich. The dipping broth is pho soup. The sandwich consists of a soft & squishy fresh French bread, perfect for absorbing that yummy pho like a sponge. The inside is filled with slices of rare beef, jalapeños, onion and bean sprouts. A definite must try.

Last but not least I had the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy... Crispy shrimp, spicy Szechuan mayo & shredded lettuce sandwiched between a sliced baguette. It wasn't spicy enough for me so I think next time I'm going to try out the homemade spicy sauce that Nate was raving about and kick my sandwich up a notch.

Then there were the little touches, like the container of forks being labeled \"Fork You\" and the knives were labeled something else equally clever but I can't remember for the life of me. My point though is that it's obvious the owner thought of something creative right down to the last little minute detail... A detail that was not lost on me. Totally my style of the way I would do things if I had a restaurant. Now I must know what every single thing is labeled so I need to come back and see. Inquiring minds wanna know! Great conversation piece for guests.

I'm already plotting and planning my next visit. I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. Another patron was recommending their Sloppy Joe to me and said it's so good that it brings tears to his eyes. This is an awesome new addition to the community and it's right next door to a really good nail salon, not that you need any further incentive to visit but I'm just saying..."}
{"text":"I'll start my review with a warning: If you're on some sort of diet, don't eat here. They give you a ton of food here and all of it is anti-healthy. You're gonna develop your very own Buddha Belly if you keep eating this stuff. I swear my love handles are growing as I type this.
All this food doesn't come cheaply of course. It's actually very pricey. I spent about $24 here today (including tip) for my Sloppy Joe, Japanese Curry Fries w/egg, and a fountain drink. I would normally be Ok with that if the food justified it but....
Everyone knows I'm a tough critic when it comes to Asian food. It takes a lot for me to go ape-shit. I thought the Japanese Curry Fries had a very \"odd\" taste. I've been thinking for the past hour or so on the right word to describe the taste but I just can't put my finger on it. It doesn't taste like Japanese curry, doesn't taste like fries. The egg tasted like an egg however.
The Sloppy Joe also had an \"interesting\" taste. Now I want to be as fair as possible, so I'm gonna say that it could be just my personal taste that is not accepting this food. The person next to me (who wasn't Asian... Don't know if that matters) told the server that his sandwich was the best he's ever had. So.... the fairest thing I could possibly say is try it for yourself. It's definitely worth one visit."}
{"text":"Closed.  This is what happens when yo momma doesnt tell her younguns to switch up aka update the menu every 6 months and offers minimal healthy grindz.  Fusion is just that - novelty shit and nothing that captures the nostalgia or authenticity of ethnic  youth.  If you dont consistently evolve and are in the fusion business, you die young.

If the owners are reading this and planning their next venture, less artery clogging gutbombs and a few salad options wouldnt hurt.  I wouldnt let my daughter eat here every day because the overall menu was just too fatty and that's why this bitch prolly closed.  

I mean if your gonna go the fatty option route and select a poor location do what Jesses Pizza and Chicken Shack and Napoli do and go full fatty with great prices.  And offer delivery for those of us who mix the scoobie oobie with that purple drank."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews and everyone was on point. I ordered the po-boy and curry fries. The shrimp had a lot of flavor and the bread was nice and soft. The fries had just enough curry that it didn't make the fries soggy. My cousin had the pho dip which was the bomb and the chowder hit the spot on this cold day."}
{"text":"Very different. Nothing really for the kids though. Everything is really spicy! Tasted great but I'm gonna pay for it later. We had the Thai tea (refillable), dragon fries, shrimp po boy, and pork sandwich (not spicy). The service was awesome."}
{"text":"Wow is this a great place for ff the beaten path.. I had to go here and give the food a shot.. I tried the pork roll sandwich with the dragon breath fries.. It was great.. I can't get enough from this place.. I try to go here at least 2 times a week. I will say if you haven't tried this great spot please go give them a try.."}
{"text":"Didn't like any of the food I got there. I ate the slaw because I was hungry, but it felt like a waste of calories. The wrap I had tasted so bleh that I ended up tossing half of it out. Was so bummed that Yelp steered me wrong!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place! I got the shrimp po boy and my husband got the Pho dip sandwich. I liked mine but felt I could make it at home and it be the same, bread was nothing special and small sandwich for the price. Also, my husband thought the pho dip needed more flavor to the actual sandwich. I guess people can have different tastes.. I liked the homemade chips. The Asian Cole slaw was also pretty bland. The employee was very nice and very helpful tho."}
{"text":"The service here was very good. The chef and the cashierdelivered our food in a timely manner and they were very courteous. This was our first time here and I ordered the kimchi burrito and the hubbs ordered the katsu curry. I also ordered the thai clam chowder. The clam chowder was like a New England clam chowder with a hint of tom yum soup and some bacon. It was fantastic. 
The kimchi burrito was huge, it was exactly what you would think it would be, a bibimbap 
bowl if you will, wrapped in a tortilla. It was okay. The coleslaw along side it, was very fresh, but too salty. I ate a few bites and left it alone. The hubbs dish was very nice to look at, I don't know whether it was pork or chicken, it was not specified on the board. It wasn't something to write home about. So, finally, after all of this, I give this place 3 stars for the unlimited refills for Jones soda, the A-1 service and delicious soup. Will I come back? Maybe, maybe not."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here tonight after wanting to go here for quite a while.  It was outstanding!!  We were the only ones in there around 730pm.  We both had the Thai clam chowder which was a combo of Tom kha and clam chowder, an awesome combination.  It was a little spicy which made you want to eat more.  I washed it down with a Thai iced tea which was perfect, not too sweet.  I also had the Pho dip and the chips, both were outstanding!  I've seen people refer to the chips as \"crack chips\" and they were oh so right.  The Pho dip was great, so many flavors and everything just went together so well.  We were stuffed but since it was St. Paddy's day we had to get the Irish Car bomb cupcakes to go.  They did not disappoint!!  To top off the meal was the service.  Its been a while since I have been somewhere where the owner/chef served us, told us about everything and just made sure we were well taken care of.  He was one of the 4 people that own the place and just had passion when he was talking about the food and the business in general.  We were blown away by this place and cannot wait to go back!  Do yourself a favor and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea.  The presentation of the food is amazing. I ordered Tofu Vegi Curry. I didn't like the taste. To me it tasted funny. I make curry at home all the time. My husband ordered Bibimbap burrito. I like more of the traditional Bibimbap. I tried his. It was ok. The fries were really good though. My daughter got the Pho Dip. Hers was the best. I also tried hers. Our first time going there. We probably wouldn't go there again. The people that work there were pretty nice."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounding up to 4. As with every Asian fusion restaurant, there were some issues. We got the Japanese curry fries which were pretty good, except for the fact that the curry didn't taste like traditional Japanese curry. They should really just name it curry fries and there would be no confusion. They were skinnier fries that came pretty crispy, with some cheese and a sunny side up egg on top. 

We also got the pho dip, which came with tender beef, bean sprouts, onions and a thin slice of serrano on French bread. In my opinion, the bread needed to be toasted more and the pho soup needed to be saltier since it was a dipping sauce rather than a soup.  I think there's still a lot on the menu that looks interesting and I'd want to go back and try some other dishes. Restaurant was clean and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Second time here- upon entering Buddha deli, staff was very friendly and informative of menu. I order pho dip and Thai fries. Pho dip was very bland with no flavor. Fries were soggy. I want to like this place because staff is so kind but the food is lacking."}
{"text":"Hail The Duchess! Finally got too come check out the hype and the best part was praise the Duchess on her birthday! It was yelp social birthday lunch at BBD. Yay! Talk about the benefits of hanging with The Duchess they were kind enough too make her special birthday cake (shout out is all Terri R got ur done). 

I ended up going with the special of the day Chicken Katsu Curry with kim chee. Also had get some of the dragon breath fries cause spicy mix with french fries beautiful thing in life. Talk about nice burn! Not outrageous HOT HOT!! Be fair I do like spicy food but on the ridiculous meter. Just right amount of kick that not grabbing water or any liquid cool down every fries. Still addicting enough that you just keep it going easy the pain and one of those things not stop at one. Or just me. I does have great balance with the heat and nice garlic flavor bring it al together.

The Chicken Katsu Curry is the Japanese style one that very found of because that only style it know from the 808. The white rice and little kim chee action (not sure if they make that fresh or store bought??). The fried egg on top was the icing on the cake. Fried egg makes anything better in life. The chicken katsu love the breading panko style, chicken nice moist inside, fried egg on point (when break into the egg yolk yellow heaven on earth coats everything lovely!!), and honestly wish that on menu all the time. 

I never dived into the hot sauces that you can add. I save that for the next visit. 

Not often see restaurants without fountain drinks but here everything is cans or bottles. The best part was the Coke they sell is old school glass bottles. Different. They have really nice water on tap that self service. The owners are super friendly, attentive, checked up on us making sure everything was good, and really to GO OUT OF THE WAY MAKE BIRTHDAY CAKE for THE DUCHESS. Not only does that speak volumes about taking care of customers. Wish more business had the small business mindset appreciate loyal customers. BBD is someplace that will be stoping by more often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  

We had the pho dip sandwhich and Szchuan Shrimp po boy. The food was amazing! 
The house chips are crispy and seasoned perfectly.  
And the sweet sweet 90's R&B jams complimented the food."}
{"text":"Just stopped by after work after hearing all the good reviews. I got the pho dip with chips, my dad got the bbq flatbread, and a bowl of the kitchen sink gumbo to share. Everything was outrageous. The staff was super friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and the interior is cool. They have house made sauces that are super good, the yo mama one is awesome. I put it on everything. 

All in all, my new favorite lunch spot for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, can't find anything wrong with this place. Awesome tasting food, good friendly service and fair prices.

Clam chowder is great!!! Full of flavor.

Chicken Katsu club is HUGE. I've split it with a friend and the 1/2 was a large portion. 

Pho Dip sandwich was yummy ness from beginning to end. A bit of heat makes the Sammy. 


I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the pho dip with Asian slaw, and had tastes of the Thai clam chowder and dragon fries. The pho dip was one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. The Thai clam chowder and Asian slaw were excellent and unique. The dragon fries were fine, but nothing special.

If I lived in Henderson (instead of San Diego), I would be eating there every week."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering/eating from here.. I work at the tanning salon right next door and hunger hit! The gal on the phone when I placed my order was super sweet.. I missed her name but she had the piercing in. GREAT customer service and very welcoming. It was a different kind of look inside, but nothing in a bad way at all :) so now to what's important.. The food! I got the pho dip with a side of chips and it was AMAZING!!! I will absolutely come back here and recommend it to everyone :) thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I have received in this entire city! The employees are so attentive and were checking in to make sure we were taken care of. I really appreciated it! I had the thai clam chowder (DELICIOUS!)  Curry fries and the Pho dip! All of them were phenomenal. I highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"The overall concept of Buddha Belly was great.  I enjoyed almost all our dishes.  The only thing was a disaster was the Vietnamese iced coffee which was basically iced coffee poured over condensed milk."}
{"text":"Yes I'm giving them a 2 star rating, might even give them a 1 star... gets into my fighting stance ready to protect myself. Joking aside yea my whole experience was completely opposite from everyone else who loved this place. 

Walked into a mostly empty Buddha Belly Deli and really didn't get that welcoming feeling I was hoping from a new small business trying to sell their stuff. The guys in the back all seemed busy, probably doing kitchen stuff, they were in the back with their backs to us so I didn't expect them to greet us. There was a girl behind the front counter, got nothing really out of her. A little Hi, how are you, welcome to blah blah we blah blah, please take a seat, is this your first time here, try this try that, the usual chit chat would've been great. Customer service was very minimum. I was pretty much over it before it started and wanted nothing. 

First up was some dessert, eggnog mochi and pumpkin crunch http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buddha-belly-deli-henderson?select=sI13tDKvWU7DeO-aDueAtw#sI13tDKvWU7DeO-aDueAtw Didn't care for either of them.  The mochi was different. The pumpkin crunch had too much crunch and very little pumpkin filling. No one wanted to finish them.

Next was some sloppy joe smothered fries www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buddha-belly-deli-henderson?select=NZ_IYzKmyGb7rsagypkkLw#NZ_IYzKmyGb7rsagypkkLw It was fries topped with their \"sloppy joe\" meat mixture and a fried egg.  Again it was different, not like the sloppy joe we all grew up with. And again no one wanted to finish it.

Last was the char siu pork roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buddha-belly-deli-henderson?select=MuGR7Beh8K5RH9PHXNw-Xg#MuGR7Beh8K5RH9PHXNw-Xg It was marinated pork shoulder, carrot-daikon-jalapeno pickles, asian slaw, and hoisin BBQ sauce served on  a sweet roll. I liked some of char siu pork and slaw mixture but not all of it. Didn't like the soggy bread part or the hard dry bread part but enjoyed the bread parts when they were in between. It came with over seasoned chips and some tasty pickles.

The prices and interior is decent. It seems like it can fit a nice amount of people.

Sure I'll try it again, maybe, but not anytime soon. Nah probably not. I still have leftovers in the fridge.

The positive is that I think it's next to a tanning shop."}
{"text":"I don't always leave a restaurant with a case of the sniffles, but when I do it's because I've just partaken in some deliciously spicy eats. BBD (as it will now be affectionately referred to, and not to be confused with the other equally tasty and spicy boy group BBD) gets it all right. 
I, of course, had to order the Pho Dip and the husband had the Shrimp Po Boy. Both were equally delicious. The Pho Dip had so many wonderful flavors, which on their own may not be as delicious, but together are miraculous. Especially when you add a dab of the sinfully spicy Ghost Chili (the reason behind the sniffles), these flavors just work together. The Po Boy had a good amount of shrimp in it which had not been drenched in batter, the shrimp had more so rolled around with some delicious spicy flavors. Again, all these flavors working in unison. For dessert, we opted for a 5-spice ginger cupcake, the macaroons, and a couple of green tea white chocolate cookies (I know right??). The macaroons were my favorite. You just have to trust me and try them yourself. We also ordered some of their Thai iced tea (free refills!!) which was equally delicious since it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. 
This place is divine. It must be awesome to have the skills to fuse flavors together and actually make them work, to pick up empty plates night after night and know that somewhere, someone is still dreaming of your food and planning their next order. Next time (and yes, there will be a next time) I am giving their flatbreads and fries a taste and I hope that once again, they send me out with a case of the sniffles. See you soon BBD!"}
{"text":"I wants to give 5 stars as I love the food, but my wife is never overly impressed with the food.  So I think 4/5 stars will do.  Love the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Casual, fast, fun Asian fusion lunch spot. Worth the drive over. Customer service is genuine and fun. I think they like working here. Go ahead and ask for recommendations. Here's what I've tried so far:

Thai Clam Chowder- Pretty good and plenty of clam chunks. Not too spicy and exactly what I was hoping for. It's like a Thai curry in flavor and also because the potatoes. I do wish they were cooked more. I would eat this with a meal if I was super hungry, but I could be full if I had it with an appetizer. 

Dragon Breath Fries- Skinny fries tossed in chili oil and a mess of other stuff. Even though they look kinda naked each fry has something on it. I'm sensitive to spicy so I was sweating, but I still really enjoyed them.

Chicken Salad Sandwich- The chicken still had the skin on, mmmm. It looked like dark meat too, yay! Whatever it was tossed in was delicious. What a fresh and light sandwich. Plus, dat bun! Love the buns here! Served with furikake chips.

Sloppy Joe- This is my favorite thing here so far. Even though the meat already tastes great the hot sauces complement it well. Drippy and full of shredded short rib. Great harmony in this sandwich. Served with furikake chips.

Furikake Chips- Sweet and salty. Check your teeth when you're done for seaweed flakes.

Pho Dip- In theory this sandwich is cool. Red meat strips and sprouts in a baguette that you dip in pho broth. But I wish I could pour a ton of hoisin and chili sauce in the pho. I mean, that how I usually eat it so that was missing for me.

Short Rib Red Curry Flatbread- So cheesy. It's drippy and rich. I loved the burnt parts of the crust contrasting with buttery cheese. I couldn't finish it either so share with a friend.

Cold Brew Coffee- They use local fresh roasted beans. Smooth and roasty. I love cold brew because it's less acidic. I would come here just for coffee. Drink it black!"}
{"text":"Visited on a whim. Relied on the reviews. Did not disappoint! We loved this! Will be back. In fact, we want a franchise in Salt Lake City."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner with my wife, found out they had just opened, and were prepping for their grand opening on Sunday. The service was exceptional and personal, they were very interested in feedback on their new menu items (which was all of it). We had a thai style clam chowder, the Pho sandwich, and Chicken Katsu. Everything was just AMAZING, These guys have mastered an incredible balance of flavor, spice and freshness that I haven't experienced in many places. We left with a sampling of free pastries that were also excellent. I can't recommend this place enough, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hope Buddha Belly Deli never goes out of business, I worry because I've never seen it crowded.  Their food is across the board GREAT - love the Katsu Club, the Pho Dip (such a brilliant sandwich) and oh yeah, they make bulletproof coffee (no one else does that) plus you earn a free entree for every nine??

Buddha said, \"What we think, we become\".  Well I may be becoming a Pho Dip."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Pho Dip is my favorite and also the Thai clam chowder. Ordered the Dragon fries last time! They were awesome and so spicy so be careful!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat here. The line wasn't that long, but each customer took literally 10 minutes at the register. They didn't even order a lot, the lady was just super slow and had a strange attitude. I was looking at the menu and didn't find anything that sounded good. Their sandwiches are either spicy or weird. The other items seemed lame and overpriced. My coworker and I decided to leave and go to Subway with the last 5 minutes of our break remaining..."}
{"text":"I really want the capability to half stars, but here it goes. We went here because it sounded different and personally, I like different. Definitely did not disappoint. 

Ambiance: cute little nice decor. Clean, well kept, and simple.

Food: what we ordered and what each thought is

Dragon fries- WIN! they were hot and spicy, and actually spicy, not tourist spicy. The kimchee ketchup was awesome and even my husband lunged it. 

Thai clam chowder: aMAYzing!! So delicious. Perfect blend of the two and probably prefers over regular New England chowder. Yuuuuuuuumtastic

Green tea and white chocolate cookie. Soft, chewy, enough green tea to taste, but not overpowering for those new to the green tea palate.

Pho dip: mixed thoughts. The sandwich itself is AWESOME. very tender meat, a great combination of textures and flavors. My only sad now on this was the actual dipping broth. It's just a little lacking. I think it needs just a hint more flavor 

The sloppy joe: k my hubby ordered this and I was so jealous. I got a couple bites. One of the best flavors/textured sandwiches I've ever had. Sweet, meaty, crunchy, and a profile of flavors. 

Chips: perfectly crispy and thin. They have miscellaneous hot sauces that are made by them and while I didn't love them all they are worthy of a chip dip.

The Vietnamese iced coffee- sweet and creamy but not too sweet and creamy. I hate Vietnamese iced coffee that is overpowering on the sweetened condensed milk.

Black peach iced tea. Delicious and refreshing

Blueberry white chocolate almond cookie - chewy, buttery tasting, and great.

Vanilla cupcake with mango buttercream. Subtle, but definitely there. Good frosting. I ate some on a spoon

Thai tea cupcake. Not my fav. This guy was a bit dry and dense for me


Overall, great spot to mix it up with the routine. As long as these guys are consistent we will ready here again and again!"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of my dear husband. I had the dragon breath fries and the Buddha's delight (even though I'm not vegetarian) and I must say I'm now a die hard fan!!!! The fries were spicy on their own but add the sauce they serve with it and it was even better! Not burn your face off... Just the right amount of warmth! The chips are crisp and dry (not too greasy). The wrap was amazing and didn't make you miss the meat at all. Side pickles were light and crunchy nomnomnom! The staff was delightful and helpful! The dining area was clean and pleasantly decorated!!! I'm planning on leaving with a sandwich for later hahahah!"}
{"text":"Tried BBD because of the reviews. The store was clean and looked nice. Our cashier was very friendly and offered to help with suggestions on the menu. We ordered Cajun fries clam chowder the sloppy joe and the katsu club..  Our food came out in good time.  When we finished our cashier insisted he would take care of cleaning up our plates. Overall the food was ok but I feel like there is better options on their menus. I will come back to try the pho dip!

Cajun fries 3/5
Sauce was good but not something I'd order again 
Clam chowder 5/5
Sloppy joe 3/5
Was a bit greasy but the meat had good flavor
Katsu club 3/5 
Service 5/5"}
{"text":"The Pho Dip is definitely tasty and a unique dish. As soon as I tried it I thought to myself, \"Of course! This makes so much sense!\" Needless to say, fans of Pho and French Dips should enjoy this. Just like Maxence Cyrin's cover of the Pixies' Where is My Mind, the original composition is beautifully maintained while packaged in a entirely different form in this sandwich--the Pho flavors are all maintained in spite of being presented in the useful sandwich vehicle. 4 Stars for this sandwich!

After the Pho Dip, I wasn't as into the rest of the items we tried. Everything else was unmemorable and simply adequate. The manager was very friendly--creating a welcoming environment, but not so redemptive to allow me to concur with the majority of overwhelmingly positive reviews. Nothing bad here, but I'm not buying the Yelp-hype created around Buddha Belly Deli. In the end, BBD is a place I would go to if I was nearby, but not one I'd seek out."}
{"text":"Didn't love anything here unfortunately. To be fair I'm not a meat eater and they were out of pizza dough the day I went. That eliminated a lot of choices for me. The Brussel sprouts special was good but very very heavy."}
{"text":"Everything was really yummy! Tried the Pho Dip, Szechuan Po-Boy, and Dragon Breath Fries. Their homemade chips were addicting and I loved the Yo Mama sauce."}
{"text":"Budda Beli Deli!!! Oh ma gawd!!! You guys know I love my fusion places. This is Asian fusion with sandwiches. I had the popular Pho dip today, which is there take on a French dip. With the Pho soup for broth. I couldn't stop making yummy noises the whole meal. Off 215 and valley verde for all my green valley peeps."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, a little disappointed. Set my expectations a little higher from all the news feed and recommendations i've seen and heard.

Had the Pho Dip, Buddah Delight and the Thai Iced Tea.

Pho dip is a great concept, and has a great taste. 
I recommend taking the red onions out.

The buddah delight wrap, was too soggy for me
to eat. Kind of redundant to give someone a side of their special cabbage with a wrap full of sautéed cabbage. 

The thai tea tasted like the powered teas you find in the grocery market. Definitely wasn't worth the 3$. 

Staff was okay. Not as attentive nor knowledge on menu. 

Most likely will come back, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Good little spot for some interesting fastish food. The wings and the falafel wrap were very good."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches. I have tried many different ones and they are really good. What I have experienced is that they forget to place some sauces that go along with the sandwich many times. 2 times out of 3, the third one being not offered an extra sauce. So you get to choose coleslaw or chips. They both are too too strong. chips are too salty and coleslaw being too saturated with dressing. Their fries are also pretty good, spicy, but good spicy."}
{"text":"Very creative items on their menu. If you like pho then you'll love the Pho Dip which is what I ordered. For my side I got the chips instead of the slaw and it also comes with a small side of pho broth to dip your sandwich. Awesome! I can't wait to come back and try more things. Be sure to check out their specials too."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. The flavors that they are putting on a plate is amazing. Katsu club hit the spot and Dragon breath fries are great. Can not wait to come back and try the Pho Dip. New fav place!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food....Even better service.
I was visiting Vegas and staying in Henderson for the weekend when I came across this gem in the desert. 
The food is amazing. Service is better than anywhere else I have been to. Loved the appetizers and main course as well. They started about a few months ago as told by the owner. Hopefully they will grow up and come to LA soon!!!! ;)
Asian Fusion at its best!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I'm generally not a fan of asian fusion, mostly because I am sort of obsessed with standard asian food, and you sometimes just shouldn't mess with a good thing. Asian fusion always tries too hard to be something, and sacrifices a lot in the process in my experience, sadly this wasn't much of an exception...

The interior was very clean and brightly decorated. Typical Westernized images of the Buddha on the walls. I was excited to see a Jones Soda Fountain upon walking in (something much more popular in the Midwest where I am from), but sadly the fountain soda machine was out of CO2 when we were there so it was just pumping out syrup and water. 

The person who rang us up was a young woman who was very friendly and helped explain some of the menu items and gave recommendations to us as it was clearly our first time. We ordered the dragon breath fries, pho dip, and pork roll sandwich. 

The food itself was really hit or miss. The fries were actually really good and had a nice amount of heat (not recommended if you don't like spicy). The pho dip was also pretty good, though could be made better by perhaps creating some sort of mayo with Sriracha? I typically make my pho pretty spicy so there was definitely some heat lacking in this sandwich for me. The pork roll sandwich was very odd in flavor in my opinion. It was a little bit sweet but left an odd after taste that is really hard to put into words. After every bite, my spouse kept laughing at me because the only words I could muster were \"this is weird\" and \"I don't know what they are going for here.\" Finally, the coleslaw that came with both of our sandwiches was definitely on the dry side. What little bit of dressing they used did taste good, there just needed to be 3-4 more tablespoons of it to make it all work. 

Overall, just a mediocre experience, and for the price, probably won't be going out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This joint is REALLY good!!! I had the Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy. Although it's not an authentic Louisiana Poboy from the Motherland, the idea is absolutely excellent! The shrimp are so crispy & THEY BAKE THEIR OWN BREAD!!! It makes all the difference in the world. Their chips are off the hook, for sure."}
{"text":"$$ but the food was outstanding, well worth it. Staff was very friendly, restaurant was clean, well decorated with asian fusion theme."}
{"text":"Let's keep it simple, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been twice, tried a variety of items, and been overly impressed each time!! Let's just say I would not expect it to stay a hidden gem with flavors like this. The word is out! The Yelpers/Hipsters/and Asians of all sorts will be here soon if they have not yet already! 
My first trip, I met a bunch of Yelp ladies for lunch. I tried the Thai Chowder (AMAZING), the red curry flatbread, and a few bites of Terri R.s chips. 
I also had a Thai ice tea, which was perfect and not overly sweet. The service was friendly, the food was unique, and overall I really enjoyed everything about this place. It wasn't until trip #2, that I actually fell in LOVE. 
I dined on my lunch break with a coworker. It was her idea to share some Dragon's Breath fries. Just thinking of that spicy, mouth watering flavor is making me want some as I write this review. I sat there the entire meal contemplating what spice they use on those dam fries. Red Chile? Serrano? WHAT ELSE!?!? It is served with a siracha like ketchup that really makes this a flavor overload. 
I also went with the Pork roll. Thich chunks of BBQ pork, Asian slaw, housemade pickles. Are you drooling yet?! This sandwich hit the spot. Add a little Bad Karma sauce for a nice kick. You get sweet, spicy, savory, and meaty all in one bite!!
Now if the food hadn't already won me over, the service was so on point!! We were checked on by the cashier, the server, and even the chef came around from the back. Full of smiles, and concern for the customers. 
I will be a regular at this place until they kick me out! I hear they have a secret menu too. I will be picking more brains next visit."}
{"text":"We had the pho sandwich (very tasty) with the slaw (excellent) and a side of the chips. Yum."}
{"text":"I didn't really know what to expect from this place but I gave it a shot because the food seemed to be pretty interesting and we are always up for something new.  

We had the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Pho dip and gave the Dragon Breath Fries a try.  I will say that maybe I'm not a huge fan of Asian flavors with my sandwich and that could be the reason I wasn't impressed.  The dragon breath fries were interesting but I wouldn't enjoy a whole order of them (after a few I was wishing for plain fries)  Again this may just be my taste preference.  The place was nice, clean and super friendly.  Reminds me of something that would be great in the downtown area. There wasn't many desserts when I went so I didn't get one but from some of the pics make the desserts look great.  This shop def has potential, it's just alright for me as far as my taste goes."}
{"text":"Shirley B is the Food Ninja for all of you Jedis in training, she finds places before they are open. Today, I took the leisurely 125 mile drive from N Snobberlin to this remote area of Henderfornia to join some lovely ladies who Yelp! for lunch. Initially planned as an intervention for Shirley's BBD addiction...we all caved to the fabulous food. 

The Clam Chowder: Holy Mother of Gd, yeah, it is that good. Take a NE chowdah and add Tom Kha elements (thinner texture than former and packed with flavor like the latter) and wow, it is perfection, something I can see ordering again and again. 

Asian Falafel Wrap & Furikake Chips: there was so much delicious going on in this vegan option! A little heat, falafel is crispy and tasty, lots of veggies, Asian slaw, hint of curry, in a serving so generous I took half home. The chips should be sold, but I should never be allowed to buy them: ZOMG crunchy, not too salty and toecurl inducing; housemade pickles are the perfect tart accompaniment. 

The service is friendly, space is inviting and the price is right (under $15 for the above including a couple of $$ into the Tip Jar) I'll absolutely be back to try more food, see Mrs. B & Rafael F's epic mustache which I'm nominating for an Elite badge of its own once I've posted this...

*** Distance between Snobberlin & Henderfornia only FEELS like 125 miles when you take 215, but Valle Verde exit takes you right to BBD car park ***"}
{"text":"I think the Curry flatbread is tastier than the Asian BBQ flatbread. Have not had an item that I did not like. Desserts are nothing to write home about, but great food, good coffee and great service here makes this a solid pick for lunch or dinner. Don't forget you can order online, and don't forget to pick up a punch card!!"}
{"text":"An interesting Asian twist. I had the shrimp po boy and my bf had the pho dip. Definitely filling and tasty. Keep up the creativity!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Amazing!!   The staff is so helpful and I love the variety on the menu.  I asked if they could accommodate my gluten free intolerance.  Immediately they said yes.  I decided to chose a sandwich with  the gluten free bread to go.  They packaged everything to go in a nice bag and even gave me some samples of their desserts to try.    At first when I opened the contained It looked like just a nice roast beef sandwich.  But let me tell you.  When I bit into it the sandwich was full of true flavors of Pho.   Definitely worth trying.  I can't wait to try more of the food on their menu next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First of all . . .I must give this place credit for being unique . . .finally , not the usual burger, Chinese, or pizza place.  This was a lunch that I have never had anything like before.

My wife and I split the Pho Dip and the Shrimp Poor Boy.   Both came with a side.  We had a side of chips and a side of slaw.  The chips are a bit salty and my wife said they tasted like fried fish (not a good thing).  The slaw however was quite tasty . . . .love that sesame and ginger flavor.

While the food was good, it was not good enough to make me want to come back on a weekly or monthly basis.  Maybe once in awhile.

The menu is a bit limited and the portions are a bit small for the price.

I certainly hope they make it though . . . it is a tough location with little to no foot traffic.

Best of luck to you Buddha Belly Deli."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a lot of friends. Finally i was able to go and check it out. LOVE the fusion concept. I can say, the food, good, but could be better. The sliced beef for my dip sandwich needed salt. The broth that came with the sandwich also could have used more seasoning. It was too light for me. The edamame falafel, was GOOD so was the slaw and dressing in the wrap was TASTY as well. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Delicious!  After seeing Shirley B. check in here 4 times in 3 days I knew I had to check it out.  Went with Hubby after work and first off the whole menu looks amazing.  Makes it hard to decide what to get.  We decided on the Thai Clam Chowder, Pho Dip, Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy, Smothered Sloppy Joe Fries and Thai Iced Tea.  We originally ordered the Japanese Curry Fries but after we ordered and sat down we were told they were out of the curry and offered Sloppy Joe fries instead.  I didn't really want them so said we would just go with the garlic fries.  I thought he then offered red curry fries, which I got, but turns out the Sloppy Joe Fries have red curry in them.  So I ended up getting the Sloppy Joe Fries after all.  OMG they were so good!  For something I thought I didn't want, they ended up being my favorite part of the meal.  Only thing I would change would be to serve on regular plate, it was in a plastic basket on paper that got soggy and then tore and got in the food when we ate the fries.  Didn't stop us from eating them all though.  Everything we ordered was outstanding.  I could eat a vat of the clam chowder it was that good.  Clam Chowder is my favorite soup and the Thai flavors just send it over the moon.  Both sandwiches were delicious and we loved the homemade chips.  They brought out Green Tea Brownies before we left and they were moist and decadent.  I was impressed.  Sometimes you go to a place and sandwiches are great but the desserts are rubbish.  Not here.  They do everything at a high level.   The service was excellent.  Everyone was so friendly and genuine.  I think at least 4 different people checked on us, introduced themselves. asked how we heard about them, talked to us about the menu and how they worked on it.  What a great group of people.  I can't wait to come back and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli is the bomb!  I've had a few of their sandwiches now, and they are all excellent.  My personal favorite so far is the Pho dip.  Very nice thinly sliced beef that melts in your mouth fills this sandwich.  They certainly don't slouch on quality here.  The sandwiches have a sort of Asian American fusion thing going on, but this is executed extremely well.  The flavors are so balanced and intentionally chosen.  A+ sandwich shop.  Oh, and the owners are extremely friendly as is the staff!  A+ Food, and A+ service!"}
{"text":"You're not going to please everyone; and that someone is me. 

An uber casual dining experience where you place your order at the counter and they bring it to you. The restaurant is new, clean with little decor. I spotted clever empty green Lucky Buddha beer bottles adorning each table. The restaurant is owned and operated by four young dudes and they are on a mission to create an environment with modern, Asian fusion food at a competitive price. 

I will offer them 5 stars for their concept and service; they are an clever team and offer exceptional service. However, with a lot of regret, I have to admit I was not a fan of the food here. I really wanted to see the food excel to new levels of flavor offered in their menu. It didn't hit the mark.

Selections:
Pho French Dip $9 - My Vietnamese tastebuds craved more Vietnamese flavor. The broth was spiritless and watery. The pickled bean spouts and Chinese mustard were undetectable. My compliments to the chef for executing a fine \"roast beef\" by using a Chinese 5 spice rubbed top sirloin, it was super tender and moist; but he missed the solid, bold aromatic pho \"Au Jus\" to dip the sammy. Flavor rating: 2/5

Thai Clam Chowder $3.50 - sadly it was served tepid and we sent it back to be reheated. Portion size was not generous and, again, it was watery. I wished to see more chunks of goodies swimming in the soup, but I was left with only a few surprises. We were expecting thick chowder - but this had the consistency of tom yum goong. We felt it could have used a substantial amount of lemongrass or ginger to wake it up.  Some more curry would have answered the call for Fusion. The soup had some promise, but quickly fizzled out. Flavor rating: 2/5

Japanese Curry Fries - fries smothered in a thick Japanese curry-like gravy and topped with a fried egg. It wasn't too exciting. However, they supply a spicy sauce bar and we tooked to dunking. Flavor rating: 2/5

To be fair, I was an avid fan of their house made hot sauce bar. They range from mild, medium, and drop dead hot. I enjoyed the flavor and unexpected heat they added to the dishes I tried. The hottest one packs an insane kick in the ass so beware your pretty little tastebuds. Flavor rating: 5/5

The house made seasoned chips that came with our french dip were soggy with grease, but still addictive. So I'll mark that one as, tasty but naughty. Flavor rating: 4/5

I wished I tasted more soul in the dishes we tried. They all fell pretty lifeless on my palate. A little more lemongrass, or salt, or star anise, or curry would have made a world of a difference. Instead, it was very watery and juvenile.

Alright, I may be overly critical, but could you blame me? I have Vietnamese tastebuds so I would want to pick up on some sort of burst of ethnic flavor! I feel like they dulled down seasonings and ingredients by a lot in order to appease a wider variety of palates. I suppose in the end, you're not going to please everyone; and that someone is me. 

Props to having a vision to go for something new, something different, something exotic. But let's be real, don't be scared of flavor, it will get you further than you can ever imagine."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices fresh food vegan options and a very friendly staff . The spicy fries are spicy and excellent -the wraps have no comparisons . If your vegan or just love Asian fusion and don't have a ton of money but a five star palette -it's a little out of your way in Vegas in Henderson but worth the drive"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few co-workers and we all agree the food is on point! I wish it weren't so far because I can easily see myself eating here often. The food came out in a timely fashion and the cashier was friendly. I will be taking the family here soon! Check 'em out because they are delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love everything about this place. Food is unique, reasonably priced and delicious. Came here for lunch and had the Pho sandwich, dragons breath fries and chicken wings which were on special. The sandwich and fries were great, but the wings were amongst the best I'd ever had and were only $7!!! I cant remember exactly how many came in an order (bc I immediately started stuffing my face with them) but I'd guess there were ten and every single one was above average size. The fries came with some sort of a spicy ketchup that was good, but I liked dipping them in the spicy mayo sauce that came as a side with the wings. Can't wait to come back. I hear the soups are great too but I'll wait until it's not 120 degree out before I try those :)"}
{"text":"Great!  Everything was delicious!  The dragon fries with kimchi ketchup was really good."}
{"text":"You never know if the previous reviews will live up to your expectations but in this case it did! The sweet and spicy chicken wings were on fire and a very healthy portion. 

The Pho Dip was fresh and delicious along with the frutikake chips! I'm currently 9 months preggo and I could eat those all day."}
{"text":"First off, the men who work here are pretty hot. You know what else is hot? Those dragon fries. I hope you enjoyed that Segway. My mouth is on fire people and I left there an hour or so ago. I got some fried chicken sandwich and let me yelp you, it was the bomb. The guys cleared our plates, very good service and very friendly staff. Of course I'll go back. I love me some fried chicken and I love me some spicy hot."}
{"text":"I'm not a foodie and I lack the wherewithal to offer an experienced analysis of the food, but I found this place a pleasure.  The service and the greeting were top notch when we arrived.  The food is very much as described (in other, positive reviews).  It's just a great, lighter alternative to more traditional fast-casual options.  Very different and imaginative food.  My wife and I enjoyed very much."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this little Henderson Gem. I had the Shrimp Po boy and it was a fantastic think outside the box take on the classic. It came with an Asian Slaw...very nice. My wife loves her pork sandwich and my daughter had the pizza which she loved as well. Place is clean, friendly and above all be food was great! I highly recommend checking them out. Not your typical \"deli\" so don't walk in thinking you are getting a sub sandwich. Buddha's is a think outside the box Asian inspired, foodie place. Appreciate that!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite for lunch. It is conveniently located close to the highway. I am impressed with the amount of variety that they have for Asian fusion. Definitely try their Pho dip. The fries are also very crispy and tasty. The flatbreads are also good. The shrimp Po boy sandwich is very flavorful. Excited to try new concoctions. Kudos to the creative chefs!"}
{"text":"I walked in and was greeted, i asked what's good at the counter and the polite girl behind the counter said the pho dip and dragon fries were good. While a sat and sipped my Jones soda that they carry on draught i pondered about life. Finally my food comes and I die from a food orgasm. I got better tho. Im from the SF area and this reminds me of gourmet food trucks from larkspur landing back home. If you're a picky eater you might not like it here cuz it's good food. 5 stars will f*ck with it again."}
{"text":"Place is super good and unique! Service and people are really nice, highly recommended."}
{"text":"So, I've wanted to come here for a few months, based upon the Yelp reviews, but hadn't had the opportunity until this evening.
Thank you, Yelpers, for pointing me to this amazing place!
I had the Char Siu Pork with home made chips--I wolfed it down like a starving child. Every bite made my tongue tingle with happiness.
My husband, who said he wasn't hungry, cleaned the plate then grabbed a to-go menu for the future.
The place is immaculately clean and the decor is funky/contemporary. The guys working here are honestly nice, attentive and knowledgeable without the cloying found in many small establishments.
Love it here!! 
I just became a regular!"}
{"text":"When I think of anything Buddha, old school Chinese kung fu movies seem to come to mind. For this place, it is all about Asian fusion and for any thing kung fu related would be referring to any of their spicy sauces which gives you quite a kick.

Since noticing plenty of Yelp friends checking in to here, I knew I had to make that trip as well. I have already been here twice since then.

Located just off the Valle Verde exit from the I-215, these guys are located in the Kohl's shopping complex. They took the place of what used to be East Coast Eats, which was not a bad joint to eat at either.

My first initial visit I went with the Pork Char Siu Roll($8). It has Marinated Pork Shoulder, Carrot-Daikon-Jalapeno Pickles, Asian Slaw, and Hoisin Barbeque Sauce served on a Sweet Roll.  Comes with House Made Chips (Potato, Taro, and Furikake Seasoning) and slices of sweet tangy pickles. With all those different ingredients put together it all came together nicely flavor wise. 

My second visit, I brought my wife with me so we shared the Pho Dip ($9), 9th Island Potato Salad ($3), Soup of the day which was Thai Clam Chowder ($3.50), and Dragon Breath Fries ($4).

The Pho Dip has Chinese Five Spice Rubbed Top Sirloin, Pickled Bean Sprouts, Red Onion, Cilantro, Basil, and Chinese Mustard served on a Baguette with Pho Au Jus. Basically, its a Pho Soup in a sandwich minus the noodles and broth but with the Au Jus as your dip. 

The 9th Island Potato Salad has Spam, Roasted Garlic, Potato, and Mayo. It tasted kind of bland. I was expecting just a little bit of saltiness because chopped spam were in there.

The Thai Clam Chowder was good. Basically it was just clam chowder mixed in with curry and some basil leaves. I liked it for it was definitley a different twist on clam chowder.

The Dragon Breath Fries are definitely rightfully named. You have french fries coated with some kind of garlic oil and you can dip them in a garlic paste/sauce type of condiment that comes with it. Very strong garlic flavors here so hopefully you are not planning on talking to anybody important up close and personal any time soon after eating this bad boy. The plus is that vampires will stay away from you for sure.

Service was awesome. They check up on you from time to time.

Some random info: They have water cups available with a water dispenser that is flavored with cucumbers you can visibly see floating around inside the water cooler. No fountain drinks. You can get bottled water or soda. I was told their hours are everyday from 11 am to 9 pm but some of my Yelp friends say they are closed fridays. My suggestion would be to call first before heading out there especially if you are going across town.

Overall, I am a fan of their products and concept. Eventually I will try everything on their menu. Its just that they are not easily accessible from my hood.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #193 \"You dont have to be a Buddhist to eat here\""}
{"text":"My review may be slighted as this place seems a lot more focused on their lunch crowd.

Our feedings are usually late night because we rock climbing nearby right after work. They have the normal local hours of being opened until 9pm. We arrived about 8:30pm and they were cleaning the eating area and you could tell the cooking area was cleaned as well. When we walked in, we asked if it was too late to order and they kindly said no so we placed our order.

We started with their curry fries. Their fries were tasty, but the curry sauce was flat for our tastebuds. I added more salt and pepper and it livened up the sauce a little bit, but feel the curry sauce needs more work for the dish to be a star.

I ordered the char siu pork sandwich and my boyfriend had the chicken katsu sandwich. The portions are huge with a side of their seasoned chips. My char siu pork was thinly sliced and on the dry side, the slaw on it was okay, but the bread they use is soft and nice. My boyfriend's katsu chicken was tender, more tender than my char siu pork. His came with two portions of katsu chicken and he had the sauce on the side (his tastes are more finicky than mine). You can tell they make their own chips, which is great, but their seasoning on the chips is very inconsistent. One chip would have some seasoning and I flipped over another chip and the entire back was covered in the Parsley seasoning.

Not sure if we would come back for a dinner visit, based on the reviews, I may go back for a lunch visit when everything is more fresh."}
{"text":"The only reason I look forward to going to the doctor or dentist is because both are located in Henderson (I live on the other side of the valley), meaning after my visit I get to try restaurants I normally wouldn't visit. A trip to the much hyped Buddha Belly Deli for a late lunch was on the docket after my most recent trip. The place is tiny and I would have missed it if I hadn't been using my GPS. It isn't fast food, but as a sandwich shop it is more in line with the trendy fast-casual concept -- order at the counter, take a seat, and wait for them to bring your food to you. 

With a menu full of asian-inspired salads, flatbreads, and sandwiches they'll definitely appeal to a younger demographic. And, I'll admit I'm a sucker for any sort of Asian-inspired or Asian fusion dishes that are even remotely unique. The pho dip, a take on a traditional French dip, was fabulous. The quality of the beef was excellent, the flavors were spot on and the amount of heat was perfect for someone who can only handle mild amounts. It was the best sandwich I've had this side of the Goodwich. It also came with a side of taro chips. If they were less burnt and oily, they would have been killer.

There are a few dessert options including a green tea cookie with white chocolate chips that was a little too firm. A better option was the carrot cake cupcake. Chinese five spice was prominent in the cake while the restrained balance of the icing provided a nice counter balance. The size of the cupcake was small -- and priced accordingly -- making it a great way to end the meal on a sweet note without overindulging.

After a great first experience, I might have to make the trek back here after my next doctor visit."}
{"text":"I travel for work and am on a mission to figure out who will make bullet proof coffee on the road. This place has it on the menu and it's pretty good. The service is also very personable and attentive. I didn't have a chance to try anything to eat on the menu, but the place was packed at 230 in the afternoon...so I'm thinking food is also swell!"}
{"text":"Amazing blend of flavors and exceptional customer service. 

We had the Asian falafel wrap and the special (chicken katsu curry). They make their own chips and all food in-house!

The thai tea and Vietnamese coffee are delic!

Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"The Pho Dip was surprisingly the most fantastic sandwich I've ever had. The service is amazing and Chelsea is the bomb dot com"}
{"text":"Despite the name, this place is AWESOME!  It is a fusion of Asian, Cajun, Hawaiian, etc.  I had the Kitchen Sink Gumbo which is a Cajun Gumbo meets Hawaiian type of fusion dish. It had portuguese sausage, spam, shredded chicken, and oxtail with rice, absolutely delicious!  I also had a Pho Dip Sandwich, which is a Vietnamese fused with a French Dip sandwich. It had five spiced top sirloin in a baguette type sandwich but with vegetables lije a Vietnamese Bhan Mi sandwich, pickled bean sprouts, red onion, basil and cilantro and the dipping sauce was the \"Pho soup broth\" typically found in Vietnamese \"Pho\" noodle soup dishes.  Again this was the bomb!  And it comes with home made thick cut furikake potato chips and cucumber Kim chee."}
{"text":"Love this deli! Try the Pho Dip (roast beef with pho trimmings and pho broth as dip) - though the dip could use a little more fish sauce. Homemade potato chips with a sweet/salty seaweed dusting. Homemade pickles.

Homemade hot sauces. Lovely place. Perfect for a quick lunch. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Different taste to accommodate anyone of any flavor urges. The special in house made chili is something that is a must try. SLOPPY JOE FRIES! Gotta Have It!"}
{"text":"As someone who is not usually a fan of clam chowder, I thought the Thai Clam Chowder that my husband ordered was pretty tasty. I got one of the flat breads, which was pretty good, but next time I'd like to try something else. Husband got the \"Pho Dip\" which he really enjoyed."}
{"text":"While visiting my buddy in Henderson we decided to check this place out. Of course thanks to YELP for telling me where to eat. 

I got the chicken katsu club and the Japanese Curry Fries. First off, the sandwich itself was huge then they added handfuls of chips next it. First bite I tasted the juiciness of the katsu which was very good mad not dried out like most places but the biggest downfall was the sauce. I couldn't taste anything! 

I'll give the PHO sandwich a try next...

The Japanese Curry Fries were amazing. Who would've thought by adding Japanese curry and an egg on top of a bed of fries would be delicious?? Bless their soul lol!  

I'll be sure to try this place out again for sure!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? It used to be okay, now it's horrible. We had the Thai clam chowder to go and they didn't even bother to fill up the containers but what was worse, was the fact that my husband's clam chowder had two pieces of potato in it and that's it, mine had a bunch of stuff in it so I had to scoop some of the ingredients out and put it into my husband soup. The shrimp Po-Boys tasted plain and old, I'm surprised we didn't get food poisoning. Never again."}
{"text":"I'll be back, again and again to try all they offer!  Loved the pho dip sandwich, chips, pickles, sauces, shot rib red curry flatbread, and my fave was the Thai clam chowder.  Jones Soda on tap was unique.  I want to try the Szechwan shrimp po'boy next time!"}
{"text":"I would not have found this place if it was not for yelp, but I am glad I did.  This was a great find as the meal I had there was very tasty.  

I order the Pho Dip with a side of the House made chips.  The Pho dip itself is a play off of a french dip and is served with a side of Au Jus Pho.  The sandwich was quite nice. The meat was nice and juicy and the bean sprouts added a nice bit of freshness to it.  When you dipped the sandwich into the Pho juice it added a whole new layer to the sandwich.  Alone the sandwich would only be alright by the Pho dip is what bumped it up to a 4 star for me.  

The chips that they served where also a very nice addition to the experience.   They were nice and crisp and had a really good potato flavor to them.  There was just the right amount of salt so that it flavored them but did not over power them.  The chips where also very unique as I believe the seasoned with with flakes of nori.  As i was eating them it was a pleasant surprise.  

Over by the counter they have a section of Hot Sauces that they make in house.   Both of the ones I tried had great heat and flavor.  For me they were definitely HOT!!!! LOL This could also be because I took a HUGE scoop of the red one at one time.  

The restaurant itself is on the smaller end but is nicely decorated and modern in look.  The tables all have bamboo plant that are growing out of Buddha Shaped Beer Bottles.  The lady working the cash register was nice and welcoming.  The staff was attentive and even came out to check and ensure that we were enjoying the food.  

I hope to be able to go back and try a few more items along with some of the desserts."}
{"text":"Man thought this place was awesome until this last visit... They have no regard for quality control. Left two ingredients out of my salad and when asked to remake it the girl behind the counter was rude. The silverware was dirty and only knives were available, the sauce bar was empty and they could care less when asked about it. Can't believe I tipped the girl behind the counter only to be totally let down on every aspect of my visit. Definitely take my business elsewhere to spend $thirty three on a couple salads that were sub par and crappy service!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu and flavors! Gal behind the counter was welcoming and friendly. Nice, cozy place and well decorated. Food was really good. Wanted to try more but no room in tummy, since portions are generous. Chips were very delish! Don't know what flavor it was, but it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"To find BBD, just head north on Valle Verde exit after leaving the 215 east. You will see it on the right side of the road just past Subway, but before CVS.

Been reading all the glowing reviews about this place and finally got to check it out recently.

Ehh, it was alright. Alright. I think some of you all just need to calm down a little bit, though.

- Pho Dip Sandwich: Meat taste and portion was on point, but the pho broth was \"tremendous\" (say that in Donald Trumps voice). Very unique and tasty sandwich!
- Chicken Salad Sandwich was delicious! Chicken itself tasted fantastic! My only complaint is that it is a very sloppy sandwich and things are constantly falling off, making it difficult to enjoy it as a sandwich. You end up constantly just picking pieces off of your plate and eating it. Still though, very very good.
- I did NOT enjoy that Jones Cane Sugar Soda at all. Just tasted funky to me. On top of that, they charge somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.50 per drink! Yikes! They should have at least one of the major brands available for fountain drinks.
- These 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas set us back $28 before tip. Wayyyy too much for what you get. The food was good, but not $28 good. Sorry, not sorry.
- Service was good, though. The young lady working at the counter was very friendly and answered questions regarding menu items since it was our first visit.

So, to summarize..

- food, good
- drinks, bad
- service, good
- price/value, no bueno

I enjoyed the food quite a bit, but not likely to return at this price point. I can't give it a 2, just based on the fact that the food is just so yummy. So, for me, i will have to say...

3 stars.

A-OK."}
{"text":"We went to try to support non chains and because the pictures looked amazing. The dishes have a lot of things going on. The flavors are really strong and there are a lot of them. 

The buzz on the fried brussel sprouts is justified."}
{"text":"After reading a news article about some of the top fries in Vegas I knew that I needed to get some Dragons Breathe Fries.  So,  after a long nights wait my wife,  son and I made the 20 minute trip from North Las Vegas and had an amazing lunch.  

My wife ordered the Pho Dip, I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich and my son had the Chicken Katsu Sandwich.  All three sandwiches were perfection on a bunch.  You must try the Thai Clam Chowder. It's worth the trip just on its own. The Dragons Breathe Fries wee great.

Plus they have some of the best Vietnamese Ice Coffee in town and free refills on the Thai Tea.  

My only complaint would be that they need to open a second location in North Las Vegas so I can eat there more often.."}
{"text":"This Pan-Asian restaurant provides an innovative menu of delicious dishes in a casual atmosphere that doesn't cut corners on flavor or spiciness. The menu had so many options, it was hard to decide what to order.   I had the pho dip sandwich - I wasn't even that hungry when I ordered it, but ended up inhaling it because it was so freakin' good.  Had a taste of the Chicken Katsu that my brother ordered, which was delicious.  We also ordered the dragon breath fries, which had real Asian heat, not Asian-restaurant-catering-to-white-people heat. YUM."}
{"text":"Nicest service ever! I'm allergic to peanuts, so I inquired about the ingredients in the Asian slaw. When I heard it had peanuts, I asked for no slaw on my sandwich. The nice man taking my order asked why I didn't want the slaw, and when I mentioned my allergy, he not only offered to make the slaw peanut-free, he took extra care to wipe down the prep area to prevent cross-contamination. Plus, they separated the sandwich ingredients from the bread in my to-go bag, so it wouldn't get soggy. And, of course, the sloppy joe sandwich was amazing to boot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I loved this meal so much I already want to come back for lunch tomorrow. 

I really appreciate the offering gluten free options for those of us with a wheat/gluten allergy. It was hard to decide which items to get, but we settled for Thai Curry Chowder, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Dragon Fries and the Pho Dip, all on gluten free bread. 

The bread was thick and sturdy which held up with the huge portions of beef (Pho Dip) and ginger chicken salad in these sandwiches. The Pho was cooked a perfect medium rare, and we loved the five spice flavors with the pickled veggies. The ginger chicken salad was refreshing, loved the crunch from  the walnut, and the everything tasted fresh. 

The soup was delicious, especially with the hint of coconut. Perfect to eat on a colder night. 

The taro root and potato house made chips were divine. I could eat those chips all day long. We also got an order of Dragon Fries which were great, but watch out! Towards the bottom sits all the chili, but we loved it. 

I definitely recommend coming to this deli for lunch, dinner, whenever. Good quality food for a very good price,and a friendly staff to back it all up!"}
{"text":"No hype. Food is like music, purely subjective, but this sh**t is good! 

My experience here is always amazing not only does the food continue to be interesting and flavorful, but the customer service here is always on par. 

This was my second time inside the Buddha Belly and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the Chicken Katsu Club, which if you're not familiar with Chicken Katsu, it's a pounded flat chicken breast, that's coated in panko breadcrumbs and fried... what's not to love? Added to this is sandwich is bacon, shredded lettuce, Katsu sauce, and tomato on a super soft sweet roll. This was amazing, juicy chicken, crunchy bacon and the Katsu sauce was drinkable. 
** Don't think dirty thoughts, don't think dirty thoughts... ** - Great choice for the person who's cautious to explore this Asian fusion landscape. 

I also tried the Curry Fries and the Green Tea Cupcake, but not at the same time, that would be terrible. The Curry Fries were tasty and a great addition to the meal although once you reached the bottom of the basket the fries became liquified. I still managed to finish the entire basket. The Green Tea cupcake was good, not overly sweet, but a tad on the dry side. This might because I didn't eat it until a few hours later.

The four star rating is because at this point I need to nit-pick. The taro chips I got with my sandwich were over cooked and had a burnt taste and the curry fries were a little soggy. This however will not stop me from going back to Buddha Belly Deli. I might even cruise by this weekend!"}
{"text":"Another amazing place I've gotten to try courtesy of stalking Shirley B. It was pretty funny because while my boyfriend and I were driving here we were like, \"Watch Shirley be here\" lol and guess who we saw here? Miss Shirley B. herself! Lmao but I definitely understand why, the hype is reaaaal!

I ordered the Char Sui Pork Roll and it was everything I was craving and more. The roll was sweet and soft, the slaw on top had a nice citrus to cut the sweetness but not too overwhelming and the pork was tender and piled high! Yum! The kale potato chips were also thin, crunchy and well seasoned. Also, they're homemade pickles were amazing as well. The flavor reminded me of a Japanese cucumber salad!

My boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Red Curry Flatbread and this had amazing flavor also. In his words, \"it tasted like Tom Kha soup\" lmao I didn't quite get that but hey maybe someone out there tasted the same thing. There was a good portion of tender short rib, the sauce had a sweet tangy heat to it and there was a lot of cheese! 

I didn't get a chance to try any desserts because I was pretty full but I will definitey be back. Pricing was very reasonable considering the size and quality of food they offered."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Asian falafel wrap and my daughter loved the Pho Dip. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Wished we had one in Stockton as I would love to try out the rest of the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch on a Thursday afternoon, and have been thinking of it ever since.

I had the Char Siu Pork Roll... thinly sliced pork with Asian slaw and bbq sauce on a sweet roll.  (Roll reminded me of Kings Hawaii bread but better.)

I also ordered the Dragon Fries... if you like a little kick to your food... order these.  They aren't super spicy... but damn... it kicks up French fries to a new level. :)  Can easily eat the whole bowl by yourself if you're not careful.  Of course, you will be breathing garlic for a while afterwards. So, if you don't like garlic or plan on kissing someone soon after, be warned.

Mom had the Chicken Katsu special that came with a fried egg on top.  She \"thought\" she'd take 1/2 home... she ended up eating the whole thing since it was so good.

Our friend ordered the Thai Red Curry Flatbread.  She really liked it.  I didn't taste it but it smelled good and had veggies all over.  I think you can add a protein to it too if you like.

OH!  And then there's their cupcakes... YES! YES! YES!  I highly recommend the carrot one.  The others are very good too... but the carrot one is out of this world.  I like carrot cake so maybe that's why I liked this one so much. And the whipped cream frosting is light and not too sweet.  The whole thing just melts in your mouth. 

Now that I'm writing this... I think I'll have to go tomorrow for lunch. :)

PS... Service is really great.  The folks working here are friendly. We couldn't make up our minds so they were very helpful and patient with us.  :)"}
{"text":"This is really tasty and creative stuff. I came in on a Sunday around noon for lunch and it was empty. That is a tragedy, so please support so this place can stay thrive! I had the short rib sloppy joe, which came with curry short rib on a homemade Hawaiian roll with homemade slaw. Really flavorful, tender beef with tons of flavor on a great soft roll. The slaw was crunchy and added a zesty kick. But an awesome kicker is that it came with a side of house made chips that had great flavor, were thinly cut, super crispy, and freshly fried. Just really incredible. This is something I'd expect to have lines out the door for in an urban center like LA or San Francisco. But we're here in Henderson and lucky to have it in a strip mall!

One thing I'd recommend is updating the marquee to the shopping center from East Coast Eats (the previous restaurant in this location) to Buddha Belly Deli, which is a huge upgrade and really, really creative. I will be back."}
{"text":"Yum!  For quite a while I have heard how good this place is and I finally got to try it yesterday. 

I ordered the vegan falafel wrap with cole slaw and it was amazing. The young lady working the counter was super friendly and helpful when I told her I don't eat animal products. 

The down side: they have Jones Soda on tap and I drank so much I got a bellyache

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Capriotti Sandwiches but I have to say, I do enjoy Capriotti much better (especially their sandwich stuffed with stuffing and cranberry sauce). My husband rated Buddha Belly Deli as 3.5 (Wished there was .5 ratings available), but I wanted to give a 4 because one of the owners were attentive, nice and friendly; fries were good and I like their free refill on thai ice tea. 

We came here for a quick dinner bite and ordered: their Pho Dip, Chicken Katsu sandwich and their fries (top w/ meat and fried egg on top). The sandwiches came with coleslaw or a bag of chips. We ordered the coleslaw, but did not like it because it was bland and a little bit bitter. I hope the bitterness did not come from being stale or kept in the refrigerator for too long. We took only a bite, and did not finish it. 

The Pho Dip was just ok. Wasn't anything interesting or memorable. Just tasted like a Pho Soup dish, but just in a sandwich. If that was the case, I would have gone and ate at a Vietnamese restaurant instead.

I have to say, the only thing we really enjoyed was their fries because it was tasty and it reminded us of poutine from Vancouver. I thought it was tasty, but was just a little too salty. 

As for drinks, we ordered the thai ice tea and liked how there's free refill. Which is rare! So that's a plus. 

If the owner did not come and talk to us, we would give a 3 star. Because he was friendly, I gave this place a 4 star. But, overall, the only item I really enjoyed was their fries with toppings and free refill on thai ice tea."}
{"text":"This is the deli I haven't been able to find in Vegas. The food is outstanding. I'll definitely be frequenting this spot."}
{"text":"Traveling back from Hoover Dam, we decided to use Yelp and we found this nice restaurant. we were with three kids and everything was tasty- kids meals, Borito...recommended!!!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem! FRESH, perfectly executed, unique food. Comfortable, clean atmosphere. This place has a small, but well thought out menu. I'm glad because I plan to try everything they serve. I had the Chicken Katsu Club. The panko breaded chicken breast was fried to perfection, sweet roll was soft and fresh. I have to say when it comes to sauces, this place got it down. So many unique flavors, I feel like I'm expanding my palate. My lovely wife had the Asian Falafel wrap. The funny thing is she did not know what falafel is and asked me what the delicious green stuff was. We had a great experience and will return! 
check it out!"}
{"text":"Love how creative the entire menu is. If your looking for a sandwich shop with a twist this is the place. Everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here last night. We had the Asian Falafel Wrap, the Chicken Katsu Club and the Dragon Breath Fries. It all was very good except the Dragon Breath Fries were soggy when we got them home. And we live just right across the street so I don't think it's a time in the box thing. I'll try again and see if it's better next time. 

In any event, it's better than the East Coast Eats that was in the same place before."}
{"text":"Roller coaster of amazing Asian flavors in the mouth! We had Pho dip, bibimbop burrito, Szechuan shrimp po boy with furikake chips and Japanese sloppy Joe fries, not to mention the unique homemade chili sauces that brought everything together! I'll be back @buddhabellydeli"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Great little place to get the best sandwiches and a bullet proof munk coffee."}
{"text":"I came in because of the many positive Yelp reviews, and because I like the name.  Asian fusion, however, is a style that I'm not always a fan of.  It's often more like Asian confusion when the mashups don't go quite right, or you see the same old Asian chicken salad with fried wontons.  Buddha Belly is more Confucian than confusion, as there is something wise and interesting in their offerings.

Fried shrimp po' boy with Szechuan sauce and slaw, on a soft baguette is a good example.  It mixes a classic sandwich, with just a slight Asian twist.  Chips with furikake are just different enough to be interesting.  Char siu pork sandwich makes sense.  Dragon fries with some chili oil?  Okay.  Short rib red curry flatbread also sounds great.  I'm not sure about the Asian falafel, but next time I'll definitely want to try the Thai clam chowder and maybe the Pho dip sandwich. 

I got a little nervous when I walked in on a Tuesday night and I was the only person in the place.  The service was friendly and as you might expect fast, but I hope they get some people in there or Buddha belly might be belly up.  

Love the Jones soda fountain with orange cream, green apple, and true cola flavors.  All that's missing is a vodka dispenser so you can do your own mashup with the drinks."}
{"text":"On our way to kohl's we needed to get something to eat, so we stopped here because of the close proximity. I was a little worried that it was a vegetarian type of place because of the name, which wouldn't have deterred me...but my BF needs meat!

We were presently surprised that there is in fact, meat on the menu! There were some food items that reminded me of home (hawaii), but not your typical Hawaiian plate lunch type of meals (protein, two scoops rice, and mac salad). Which was good, because I rarely eat all of the starch!

I chose the pho dip sandwich and my BF had the kal bi pizza. My sandwich was very delicious and tasty! The meat was soft and the dipping soup was a more subtle version of pho. I totally thought the pho soup was super spicy, until I opened the other half of my sandwich and saw thin slices of jalapeños on top...no wonder my mouth was burning!

My BF's pizza was also good - it was more of a flat bread type of pizza and the cheese was the best cheese topping in a pizza I ever had!! IDK why, but it was soo good!

Service was excellent, our cashier was friendly and my BF got to talking with whom I think is the owner, who's originally from Hawaii too!

You have to try this place! It's sooo yummy! Also, the bathroom was super clean!

ps: I think it's called Buddha Belly Deli because if you keep eating here, you could end up with a Buddha belly! But, for some reason...the choices seemed healthy to me, or more health than a Hawaiian plate lunch :)"}
{"text":"Lunch at the Buddah Deli today. Got shrimp PO boy with dragon fries. My buddy got the Phó Dip and Thai Clam Chowder. The sauces were good but get the dark green one with the spices...I poured it on everything. Awesome. You won't regret this nice Asian Fusion sandwich shop. Refreshing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ordered Dragon Breath fries & Szechuan shrimp po'boy sandwich.
Fries were pretty amazing!! Hotter than h.... But amazing! The kimchi ketchup was very good.
The po'boy flavor was a bit underwhelming after the singe and flavor burst of the fries-- kinda think it may not have been the best choice for our first trip here.  I'd like to try one of the other sandwiches and maybe some of the other fries!"}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable for the portions! Food was delicious & filling!! The one complaint is that they were out of their signature sauce! However they do have free refills on their Thai iced tea!!"}
{"text":"This place opened up next to my work, the food is amazing and the staff are friendly!!!everything is so full of flavor and the portions are pretty generous. The dragons breath fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"Killer place!!! Asian Fusion at its best and at a price that can't be beat. Very friendly and always making sure your happy. The Bibimbap Burrito is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"First visit, left impressed.  Great restaurant in a strip mall off Valle Verde and the 215.  It's Asian fusion, which can either be done extremely well or terribly.  Fortunately, this is the former.  

Had the \"pho dip\" sandwich -- which is so brilliant and yet so obvious, I'm shocked I've never tried one before.  Tender beef , onions, vegetables on a baguette with a side of pho soup for dipping.  Fantasic.  Also started with a Thai clam chowder -- a blend of Tom yum soup and traditional clam chowder.  Absolutely delicious.   Will definitely be back for more...lots of other interesting things I want to try!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for months and I finally did one day when I was bored after work. Thank you God for Yelp, because I was able to go and based off of reviews and pictures already have a budget and an idea in mind of what I exactly wanted . The everything gumbo and the chowder were awesome. I also purchased one of each of the cupcakes. They weren't great but everything else was on point. The crew was super nice , which is a deal breaker no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Clam chowder, chicken katsu sandwich, fried brussel sprouts . To die for . One of our families favorite places to eat . Chips that come with meals are amazing also. I give them 5 stars always fresh food and great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place and looked at a couple yelp reviews so I decided to stop in. My boyfriend got the Pho dip, he thought it had a little too big of a pickle flavor to the bean sprouts but the meat itself was amazing. 
I had the shrimp po boy. I loved everything about the sandwich. It was served on a soft baguette, which I really appreciated because I hate when the bread is to crispy. The battered shrimp went really with the jalapeños and siracha mayo. 

They even brought us our food and did a table check, which blew my mind cause they aren't a sit down restaurant . Thumbs up! 

I'll deffinetly be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the Shrimp Po'boy with housemade chip yesterday. It was my first experience at Buddah Belly Deli and it was great! The interior is nice a clean, great menu and decor. I ordered my food to go but definitely would go back for dine-in.
Sandwich was delicious! A bit spicy but I love spicy food. Chips were great too! I can't wait to go back and try something new...I have a feeling all their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!!  The menu was diverse.  My husband and I were pretty hungry and ended up eating sooo much.  Okay so maybe just me!

We ordered the chicken katsu salad, the gumbo, side of homemade chips, fried brussels sprouts, chicken wings and the blueberry cookie...Like I said we were hungry!!!!

Everything was delicious!  Loved the gumbo and the sprouts so much!!!  Will definitely go back and try the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! This place was a pleasant surprise and absolutely lived up to the high reviews on yelp. The sevice was wonderful. The cashier was very helpful. Every item on the menu sounded delicious. 
We settled on Freshly Brewed Black Plum Ice Tea, 9th Island Pizza, and the Pho Dip. 

The tea was very refreshing and had an authentic plum flavor. The pizza was spicy and savory and the cheese was sinfully melty. My Pho Dip was fantastic. All of the traditional flavors of Pho in a sandwich. The bread was perfected toasted and crusty and the beef was incredibly favorful. I was in sandwich heaven. The homemade chips had this delectable seasoning made from seaweed, sugar, salt, a few other things. They were a great pair to the sandwich and equally yummy. The pickles were also spicy and a welcome vinegary addition. Everything on my plate was fantastic... I would have eaten the toothpicks if the were edible haha.

We will back to try other menu items and repeat our favorites."}
{"text":"Wow. Their meringues (which they make here) are SO good. Love the char siu pork roll sandwich with a spicy sauce and their homemade chips. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I came in here with my girlfriend on a Saturday afternoon after we had read an article about french fries to try in Las Vegas. The place in itself is nice and clean and has pretty modernized decor. It wasn't too busy when we were there either which is also a plus haha.

We ordered the dragon breath fries, the pho dip, and the Char Siu Pork Roll. For it being talked about in a news article, I was expecting the fries to be more than what we got. They had spices on them and whatnot but something about the presentation was just blah. They were delicious and had a nice kick to them (girlfriend couldn't handle the spice haha, good thing I didn't ask them to put extra on there). The pho dip tasted exactly like pho but with bread. It's actually a pretty neat concept and I was digging it. The char Siu roll was \"eh\" in my opinion. It was on the sweeter side and even though I like pork on the sweeter side, the sandwich was too sweet. Maybe it was the bun, but I was just 50/50 on this one. I also had Thai iced tea and I love the fact that it's free refills!!!! I probably have had better at some Thai places, but honestly theirs was tasty and I wasn't mad at the refills being free for that.

Overall I think this place is pretty awesome and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Buddha Belly! Buddha Belly!

That's the greeting we got as we walked in to Buddha Belly Deli. It seems like a fun crew working there, and they'e super nice. The chef brought our food out to us and chatted for a while about the restaurant and how they make their sandwiches. Really appreciated it!

They don't have a very large menu, but everything on it is super delicious. For their sandwiches, I've tried the pho dip, the char siu pork, and the szechuan shrimp. All three are awesome, you can't go wrong with either one, but the top runner is the char siu pork. It comes on a homemade bun which really makes it stand out from the rest of the sandwiches. 

The dragon breath fries were pretty good too...you'll definitely be tasting them for hours later though, so just be aware of that. They aren't very spicy, but the taste/smell lingers.

Also, they have some hot sauces on the side. \"Good Karma,\" \"Nirvana,\" and \"Bad Karma\" (mild, medium, hot). The best is the Nirvana - Do it."}
{"text":"BBD was recommended to me by our son! And we have not been disappointed!  The food is unique and delicious! The service is fantastic! Give it a try and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can't say it's the best, but I don't think I've had enough of the menu to find what I really like yet. I've had the Asian Falafel wrap and Asian Slaw and it was good for a no meat option.
The Jones soda fountain is the first I've ever seen and I like it, but the bottles do taste better than the fountain, but still it's cool to see that.
Today the Bibimbap burrito was on the radar and sadly it missed the mark, I know what Bibimbap should taste like and this wasn't it. (Bibimbap is a Korean dish with rice, veggies, fried egg, bbq Korean beef and a special chili paste) I guess this is just their take on it and it was good, but not what I expected. The potato chips were ok and the bottom of the bowl was just the broken scraps and ehh. Pickles pickles, all 2 tiny pieces was good, but really just 2 pieces the size of what you find in a McDonalds hamburger? We also had the Korean spiced chicken wings and it was a HUGE portion and the coating was very sugar sweet, like the Panda orange chicken, but much more sweet. I didn't mind it, but could only eat a few. It may take time and some more visits, but I know there is something really good here.  Thai clam chowder, curry fries with egg, gumbo, flatbread pizza and numerous other items. 
Like Buddha, I guess I am at peace and will not hate or be sending out negative vibes.
Something good is here, I will find it one day."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the owner was very helpful with choosing food options that you will enjoy. They were always asKed us if there was anything that we needed or wanted. They tended to our every need and it was very appreciated. Everything is made in house and from scratch. They had good music and a nice atmosphere. There are so many options that I want to go back and try but I have to pace myself. We got the Pho Dip and the Chicken Katsu Club. It was all delish."}
{"text":"This is not a \"deli\" in the traditional sense, just take a look at the menu to see why; there is much much more going on here. This is really creative, super flavorful food. We had the short rib sandwich and shrimp po boy, both amazing. Their slaw is great, and their house made chips with nori, salt and pepper are extremely addictive. The guys there are super friendly and also give you unlimited Thai tea refills! We will be coming back to try some of the other interesting stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli, where have you been all of my life? My wife and I stopped in here after a long day shopping down in Henderson for a late lunch and had one of the best meals I've ever had. 

We split an order of the dragon fries, she ordered the pho dip sandwich and I had the shrimp po boy.  Both sammies came with home made chips.  The dragon fries were great - lots of garlic and a delicious chilli sauce to dip them in, but it was the sandwiches that really ruled the day.  I love a good sandwich, and this was probably the best I've had. It was just that good.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and mixed perfectly with the sauces and other ingredients on the sammich, all of which were resting ever so softly on a delicious baguette. Amazing. I had a bite of my wife's pho dip as well and it was great (she loved it too, and she's not always the biggest sandwich person). The chips were delicious as well, with just the right blend of salt and pepper.

Service was great. Our order was taken with a smile, our food brought out promptly, and one of the folks working the counter even stopped by to check on how our meals were.  Honestly, this restaurant concept is just a brilliant idea.  And really I only have one suggestion for them - place open another store in the Northwest, as I then won't have to drive all the way down to Henderson to eat the tasty treats offered at Buddha Belly Deli.  But until that happens, I'll be hopping in my car for this place.  It's just that damn good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for any unique sandwiches. Their menu is very creative and I like the atmosphere in the restaurant. Service is always outstanding and the food is as good as it sounds!"}
{"text":"Glad I gave this place a second shit. First time u think what I ordered was just a little different than what my taste buds are used to. Today having the Asian bbq flat bread ! Holy wow! My mouth is HAPPY!"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place I ordered $20 worth of food when I showed up the first time! That includes my bulletproof coffee! I have the dragon fries that were pretty good, the Pho dip which also is good, and the Thai clam chowder which I enjoyed the most. Another great reason to check this place out is the chips!!"}
{"text":"Great first experience here with my family. I had the Pho Dip, Katsu Chicken Sandwich, and Shortrib fries. They were all delicious, and we were even given samples of their pumpkin cake to try. I know they just opened recently so they have some small details to work out, but I think it's a great start to a new business."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Owner was in there taking orders when I arrived. Really nice guy, great food. The Chicken katsu club, pho dip, and short rib fries are on point! 

I always like supporting small local business too!"}
{"text":"This place is very good... but I will say SLIIIIGHTLY over-hyped. I came on the recommendation of some other Yelpers (and you are likely to see Yelpers there when you go... this spot is like the Yelp Elite secret meetup spot, I think). 

I like the 'asian inspired' sandwich shop concept... but the offerings that I've had just don't fall into the 'as good as it gets category' for me. The 'Pho Dip', which seems to be the flagship for the place, is good, but the Pho Au Jus which it is served with, while a unique idea, just doesn't quite work for me. When i hear 'Pho' i think or something very rich in flavor and spices, but this was a little bland for me. I think it's a really neat concept that just wasn't executed 100%.  

Again... per the 4 star rating, this is a solid choice and I'll keep coming back... but for my money you're paying a little bit of a premium here for good stuff you can probably get at half the price on Spring Mountain. Definitely check it out if you're in the area, though."}
{"text":"1st time checking it out.  Chicken Katsu sandwich was awesome!  I'll be back to try another sandwich!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for lunch on a Sunday and it was about half full so we didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. 

We tried the pho dip sandwich and the char siu pork roll which were both pretty yummy. 

The pho dip - Chinese Five Spice Rubbed Top Sirloin, Pickled Bean Sprouts, Red Onion, Cilantro, Basil, and Chinese Mustard Served on a Baguette with a Pho Au Jus - this was really good and just what I was hoping for the meat was tender, the Baguette soft, the pho nice and hot. And with the selection of chili pastes it just brought it all together. Would Def get this again. Oh and I don't know how the slaw is because I got the house chops and they were super tasty even though they were on the saltier side. 

We also tried the char siu pork which was also tender and juicy without being messy with a crispiness added by the slaw."}
{"text":"I want to give it a five star.  The people running the show are very solid.  There concept and ideas are great to see in a casual quick serve place.  I like the ideas for the majority of their items but it just comes down to execution.  I went with two of my other friends, and we all ordered something different so i go to see a few of the things on hand.  We had the curry fries, dragon breath fries, pho dipped sammy, the sloppy joe, and the pork sandwich, which were all pretty solid but had their flaws.  The pho dipped was ok.  the texture of the sandwich as well as the beef was top notch.  The biggest issue I had with it was the broth.  It did not taste like anything really, i was hoping for the pop of onion, star anise, lemon grass, and i got nothing from it.  The sloppy joe was fine, i was not a big fan of red curry but my friend enjoyed it.  The best out of the three was most definitely was the pork sandwich.  Everything worked well together, and the soft and sweetness of the bread was fantastic.  I would go back and try it again, im hoping they do well in the future. love the idea"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the weekend and had eaten way to indulgently. I have wanted to try bulletproof coffee and have not seen anywhere near where I live that serves it. I did a Google search while in Vegas and the Yelp reviews for Buddah Belly Deli came up. On our way home, we stopped and had the most incredible lunch! Everything was made in house! We again indulged with the Dragon Breath Fries - they adjusted the spice just a bit for us (although they were awesome in warning us they packed a punch with the garlic and peppers) and we couldn't stop! 

My husband had the Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy and loved it...with the homemade chips!!! I had the Asian Falafel Wrap with the Asian Slaw. Everything was delicious!  We got a green tea cookie and a chocolate \"mac\" (macadamia) cookie and a Thai tea cupcake to go - all solid!

The restaurant was so clean and the service was terrific. We highly recommend Buddah Belly Deli!  We can't wait to go back - it will definitely be a mandatory stop for us in and out of Vegas!  BTW, I really liked the Bulletproof coffee too..."}
{"text":"Great flavors!! Gluten free options too. LOVE it!! We will be back to try more of the menu for sure."}
{"text":"I tried this place couple of times and its hmmm hmmm good! I want to keep going back again and again! I tried Char sui pork roll, sloppy joe, clam chowder and dragon breath fries. 

I want to ordered the Japanese curry fries and pho dip next time. The food are  delicious and very tasteful. They have flatbreads, burritos, and numerous sandwiches. They have daily specials so check them out.

The service is good and the decor quaint. The place is located in N Valle Verde in a strip mall near Kohl's store. Go find this place and try it out!"}
{"text":"Unique flavors of Asian-fusion inspired dishes, combined with friendly and helpful servers make this sandwich place stand out among the world of bland and tasteless fast-food offerings.  While you may not think that a Pho dip sandwich or curry soup would fit the American palate, it does.  I tried that and the Po Boy torpedo stuffed with fried shrimp.  Both were served with tasty homemade potato chips. Excellent!  The location does deserve 4 1/2 stars and is something you should try for a casual lunch, or even dinner.  Portions are ample, prices are reasonable (free Thai tea refills) and you won't be disappointed. 

P.S. The interior decor is non-existent, so don't go there expecting \"atmosphere!\""}
{"text":"This is my second time here and sadly it still disappointed me. My first visit I ordered the kitchen sink gumbo and considering what it consisted of you'd think it be super flavorful but it was flavorless. I decided to give this place a second shot so I ordered a simple dish, Katsu Japanese curry and first off, it didn't taste like Japanese curry and the chicken was bland. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Seeing the pictures and reviews for Buddha Belly Deli, I admit I was expecting a pretty damn good meal -- and honestly it exceeded my expectations. Holy crap those sandwiches were good. My friend and I decided to go with the Char Siu Pork Roll and the Sloppy Joe, as well as some Dragon Fries.

The Dragon Fries themselves were really tasty - garlic fries with a little kick cooked just right. But what made it really awesome was I asked for some extra spice and they tossed our Dragon Fries in Ghost Chili sauce! The Burn! ... Actually it wasn't as spicy as I would've thought - but they brought us the bottles of their homemade Ghost Chili sauce as well as their Thai Pepper sauce, which we used generously. So we put more heat on our sandwiches and our fries - but surprisingly the sauces weren't just spicy, they were absolutely delicious too! I used quite a bit of the Thai Pepper sauce which went really well in the sandwiches.

Admittedly, the Char Siu Pork Roll as better than the Sloppy Joe - The Sloppy Joe just lacked a bit of brightness in the sandwich because the short rib was so heavy. There were pickles and slaw, but it probably needed something other than Red Curry as a sauce - at least for me. However, we gobbled up both sandwiches as they were still very tasty. Oh and they had great buns!...  

The only thing I could criticize was the chips were a little too oily - it kind of ends up being a lot of oil on the plate with the rich sandwiches and chips.

The guys running the restaurant were so accommodating and clearly cared about how the food tastes - they're new so it'll be interesting to see how they keep up on that. If I lived closer, I'd probably eat here three or four times a week, but even still I do want to go back soon."}
{"text":"From someone whose lived in vegas for four years, this was the best restaurant experience I've had since being here! The food is outstanding in taste and plating, original in flavor, and very reasonably priced. Everything we tried was phenomenal and the customer service was friendly, fast, and welcoming. You can definitely tell that they take pride in their food, restaurant, and providing you with a fantastic experience. If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out. I'm a very picky eater, and loved everything, would definitely recommend the chicken katsu sandwich and chips plus the variety of teas. Don't miss out on this unique, tasty, inexpensive dining experience; there's not many places like this left where the owners have pride in their business while providing amazing meals!"}
{"text":"When you see all your \" Yelp Friends\" checking into to a place quite frequently it's time to check the place. Although I never met many of these folks I value their food choice, enough to check it out. Thank You for opening my eyes to Buddha Belly Deli. 
- I walked into an empty place since it was between lunch and dinner. This gave me time to look over the menu and ask some questions about the food. After a tough decision I chose the Chu Siu Pork roll, with homage chips, a side of 9th Island potato salad and for desert I took home some green tea cookies and 5 spice carrot ginger cupcakes. I loved the pork som much I almost got another to take home but didn't want my belly to grow as big of the Buddha. The potato salad and chips were also good and I washed it down with some house brewed green tea, so good! The deserts were equally as excellent as my meal which I tried later that night. Can't wait to go back, so I went the next day!!
-My second trip I and I still didn't know what I wanted for this menu with such great options. I selected the Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy with the Asian slaw as my side. Served on a crust baguette and loaded with shrimp, lettuce and a spicy mayo this was another prefect creation. The slaw was also good, a little heavy on the sesame oil for my own personal pallet but was delicious. I grabbed some more green tea cookies for the road and had another excellent lunch here.
- staff is super friendly from the moment you walk in, they great with a welcome to Buddha Belly Deli and assist you with any questions you have  throughout your visit. I can't wait to go back as each time I have a new favorite menu item"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(274/365) \"Solid Soft Opening!\"

Checking out the new businesses page on Yelp, This tasty looking Pho Dip Sandwich
convinces us to seek Buddha Belly Deli out for a lunch stop. Asian-Hawaiian inspired sandwiches, salads, desserts and flatbreads??? Let's DO THIS!!!

Still in the soft opening phases working out the kinks and fine tuning menu items, Mark greets us and regretfully informs us that they are out of the Pho Dip and more roast beef was in the oven at the moment. Making the trek only to find out that the item we were looking forward to trying was a slight bummer, but we didn't let that ruin our experience, as  Mark suggested their Char Siu Pork Roll which essentially is an Asian style pulled pork sandwich paired with a refreshing Asian slaw atop a Brioche Bun(also made in house) Wifey went with a cold Chicken and Sun Dried Cherry Sandwich, which was Mark's way of incorporating another local Hawaiian(actually Chinese, enjoyed by local people in Hawaii) staple, Cold Ginger Chicken and presenting it in a cold sandwich.

Feeling bad that we came for the Pho Dip, Mark also wanted us to try their soup of the day which was Thai Clam Chowder, and wanted our honest opinion. Here's mine...Imagine sexy New England Clam Chowda hooked up with a studly guy... Tom Kha Gai to be exact and made sweet love....that's what BBD's( Not Bell, Biv, Devoe!  Buddha Belly Deli you babooz!) Thai Clam Chowder is...two great flavors in harmony with crisp crostini, and a great start. Oh, this also NEEDS to become a daily signature soup, not a soup of the day. It is THAT GOOD!!! 

Our sandwiches were equally delicious, and very generous portions too. Each sandwich includes a side if your choice of Furikake Chips, 9th Island Potato Salad, Green Salad, or Dragon Breath Fries. We both went with the chips which went perfectly with the sandwiches. Oh, and the House made pickles are bomb too! Mark, Clint, and Ewa Beach local boy Ridge constantly checked up on us and were even nice to send us out some Pumpkin Crunch (Another popular local Hawaiian Dessert found at places like 808 Mixed Plate and Chez Nelson's) and even some Red Velvet Macarons with Honey Butter(Very crunchy, but will get better in time) Reasonable prices, generous portions and good flavors, this will definitely become a Henderson hot spot, and possible addition to the \"Steppin' Out\" Series!

Great first visit to Buddha Belly Deli, and things will only get better leading up to their Official Grand Opening on October 26th. SEE YOU THERE!!!   ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Great food! The pho dip is amazing and the dragon fries are a must! Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this place. Other than whenever I come here I order way too much food because it's just that good. I recently tried their Korean wings and seafood cheesecake with a tamarind habanero sauce, the cheesecake was easily one of the best things I have ever had. It was comfort food with dimension and depth. 

They are culinary geniuses, the last time we were there we could hear them coming up with new ideas for items and it made me excited because they were so excited about it. They could easily serve the same food for a higher price in more of a restaurant atmosphere and they would have the same following they do now. My last tip don't skip dessert, like I said they are culinary intellectuals. Great job guys!  

Dom and Ridge are always super friendly say hi when you walk in :)"}
{"text":"Buddha Belly is such a promising place with Hawaiian/Asian influences. I recently went for dinner during the middle of the week for dinner as I've heard only great things about it and while they were sadly out of baguettes to make their po boy and banh mi among other things it still didn't stop me from giving the rest of their menu a try. I was able to try their version of the po boy but as a wrap which was juicy and had a good amount of spice. For sides I tried their dragon fries potato salad and their house made chips which I enjoyed. One minor hitch was their 9th Island pizza which for $10 was kinda skimpy on the toppings. Throughout the entire meal the owners were great in coming over, even coming by and hooking it up with a pumpkin crunch dessert! I'll definitely be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! My boyfriend and I ordered the pho dip and the shrimp po boy. Each sandwich comes with a choice side of asian slaw or chips and we got one of each so we could try both. I personally favored the pho dip, just the way the soup soaks right into the bread making it nice and juicy...mmm...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The bread they use is nice and thick so it's very filling. The chips looked like home made, and  we actually started using the slaw as a dip with the chips, it was a nice combination together. Word of warning if you have a peanut allergy, I didn't know that the asian slaw had peanuts, and thought maybe I had overlooked a note of it, but we didn't find anything listing that the slaw had peanuts. I have a slight allergy to them but it wasn't a big deal for me, but there should be something for people who may be more sensitive.The soda fountain they have is all Jones Soda~ I personally haven't had Jones Soda since back in high school, it was a great flash back moment for me to see them. I'm not too keen on the super sweet flavors anymore, but my boyfriend and I loved the green apple flavor. 

Service was also very great, the girl who took our order checked on us from time to time, and was super friendly. 

Definitely would want to come again and try their other stuff! Their choice of fries looked really yummy too!"}
{"text":"Awesome job sandwiches are fantastic! As are the dragon breathe fries!
Note to self before smothering something called bad karma on your sandwich see how hot it is!
Still awesome"}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli has a creative menu. This place is AWESOME if you appreciate an Asian American Deli Fusion: Thai, Korean, Japanese, Polynesian, Middle Eastern. It's multiculturalism at its finest!  Yes, there's wasabi Dragon Breath fries topped with brisket or just regular fries topped with a Sloppy Joe concoction and an Asian falafel Wrap! Yup! Falafel. On top of that, they make their own frign kimchi that is to die for!!! It tastes delicious in the Bi Bim Bahp Burrito. The Cole Slaw is unique  and goes nicely with a lot of the dishes. Everything is fresh and the presentation on plate is really nice. The Thai iced tea on tap is probably the best on this side of the 215. I hear the cold slow brewed coffee is great, too, if you like a strong cup of java, but I haven't tried it since I'm trying to cut back on the caffeine while preggo. I've done some traveling in my day, and everything on this  menu reminds me of some place I've been where the food was OH SO GOOD! I love how they blend all these cultures flavors together to create tasty delights."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Tried the Shrimp Po Boy with the Asian Slaw and I can't wait to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Refreshingly different flavors for a fast casual concept (of which I am usually not a fan.)  The clam chowder Asian style is right on with lots of clams and an appropriate amount of potato.  Seasoning had a little kick with lots of flavor.  Wings in a curry sauce were the special that in my opinion should be a standard item as they were delish!  Spicy and lip tingling but not over the top.  The sauces available in the front for self service are tasty as well.  My fav was the green cilantro-great accompaniment to the meal.  Friendly service at the counter too.  I have already sent friends to try Buddha out!  I'll be back too!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It is a little more expensive than most sandwich shops, though.  The Thai Clam Chowder was very unique.  The Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy was delish.  I upgraded my side to the Dragon Breath Fries.  Even though good, not as hot as I would have liked.  Make sure you try some their homemade hot sauces.  They are outstanding.  I can't wait to get back there to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time, it was delicious, I only ate the Thai clam chowder and it was perfect, I plan to be back!"}
{"text":"Personal friendly service from the owner and recommendations based on my taste. What a great impression he left on me! I can't normally handle the spicy flavors, but the bad karma sauce with scorpion peppers really left me wanting more ! I had the katsu sandwich and the Dragon breath fries, whew! I would def recommend you come down and check out their dishes!"}
{"text":"Had the pho french dip.  It was nice having something unique for a change but I do prefer au jus to the pho since there is more flavor for the dipping.  Roast beef was of good quality but would have preferred an option for more rare.  Enjoyable place!"}
{"text":"Sadly I live miles away from this place. If I lived closer I'd be coming here everyday exploring their menu. The service is great along with the food. The food is a clever blend of American and Asian foods (for example: Pho Dip). Sadly we forgot to tip on the way out.
I have no problem with the food or service at all, but their secret menu leaves off a huge portion on what they sell. They have images of pastries on their tvs that display the menu, but its part of the secret menu. I honestly hate secret menus because most of them barely exist and its usually another word for custom orders.
I dont exactly remember what I got from there, but Im pretty sure all their food and baked goods are yummy if youre into asian foods and things like dim sum or korean barbecue.
Their secret menu is huuuuge and probably larger than their displayed menu. Its a bummer for me since I can only go so often.
The only pastry I had was their green tea brownies which was good, but the green tea flavor was masked by chunks of chocolate chip. Which sucks because it just tasted like a brownie with chocolate chips.

Pros: great food and service without the premium cost.

Cons: secret menu is huge and youll constantly miss the true experience of Buddha Belly Deli.

This place is worth trying out even with their displayed menu."}
{"text":"Different types of Asian food with a twist, love it! Came here around lunch time and it was not busy. The lady at the cashier was very nice.

The menu is not too extensive but luckily it was quality that dominated over quantity :)

I ordered the Kitchen Sink Gumbo which I fell in love with. Instead of the traditional gumbo ingredients, it had Portuguese sausage, spam, chicken and OXTAIL! I've never loved gumbo this much. I mixed some of their fire sauces they had at the condiments table, I believe it was called \"Good Karma\" (they don't mess around with their spice levels). The portion was also a good size, good enough to fill me up without a terrible food coma.

Husband ordered the Sloppy Joe fries with an over-easy egg on top. Freaking delicious. It tasted like a red thai curry (I couldn't remember the description for it)  and had nice pieces of shredded pork (or beef?). I just know I really enjoyed it haha.

Overall, the place is spacious. I like how it isn't located in a crowded area too. Workers are very welcoming and the food is bomb af. Will definitely be coming back to try the Pho Dip sandwich and more gumbo :)"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance.
Food was good. I had the red curry with veggies and shrimp.
I have never tried a Thai iced tea before so I decided to get one. It wasn't for me. 

The main thing I noticed was how every table was dirty when we came in, so I had to wipe out table off. Kinda nasty. It was not busy enough to not clean off a table or two. There were 3 other people here.....

Probably won't come back since everything was dirty."}
{"text":"Dragon fries - yum!
Awesome ketchup it came with - yum!
Char siu pork sandwich - yum!
Extra spicy chicken wings - yum! 
Slaw - yum!
Refills on thai iced tea?!?! UNHEARD OF!
Service - awesome!!
Sooo good. Highly recommend! We will be coming back. 
I look forward to trying the thai clam chowder."}
{"text":"Can I just say oh my frickety bejeesus! Amazing!!! There's not a menu item I don't love. Such a creative menu with so many different flavors that complement eachother. Every bite is a tour of uncharted territory!!  If u r looking for a familiar taste of Asia with unfamiliar dishes and a cool little hipster venue then I completely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is it. This is the place that makes everything you never knew you needed in your life and goes above and beyond any expectations you may have about it. A French Dip sandwich replaced with a Banh mi mash up and Pho broth? Yes, please. Poutine fries replaced with a Japanese curry topped with an oozy, fried egg? So genius, it kind of blows my mind. 

Now these are the only things I tried because I was in a rush to just get some take out and run, but literally everything on the menu had me thinking these guys just snuck into my brain and took everything I loved and put them into a coherent dish. Even stuff that I didn't see on the menu before I came in looked amazing like all the sweets they make. A few I remember seeing were the 5 spice carrot cupcake or a Japanese cheesecake, but there were honestly too many to keep track of in the short amount of time I had to wait for my food. 

Speaking of the service. Every one there could probably be in the Top 5 friendliest people you'll ever meet. 

Overall, this place is too great to be right behind my house. I feel like it should be a super hip place somewhere in Portland or Denver that I might see Mr. Fieri coming into and rubbing his marvelous bleach goatee all over the owners. But for now, I'm not going to complain and just enjoy until it gets so packed I'll have to wait in a 3 hour line for some of the best cheap steals in Green Valley."}
{"text":"My first five star place in Henderson! This is kind of a big deal. Being a brand new local, one of the ways I judge a place is the amount of delicious foodie places in the area. Buddha Belly Deli (try saying that 10 times fast) is a nice breath of fresh air that I really needed over in Henderson!

So what is Buddha Belly? Casual Asian fusion cafe. What does that really mean though? Heck, I don't even know. But thanks to Yelp, I stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out with some classmates. It's in a quaint shopping plaza off the 215 on Valle Verde and there is ample parking.

The inside of the restaurant seems very clean and the staff were attentive and even came around to ask how everything was or if we needed anything else. 

But I digress from the meat of the message. The food here was pretty great! After reading some reviews I knew I needed to try the Pho Dip. It was a baguette with sirloin, bean sprouts, cilantro, onions, etc. Basically pho on a baguette. The dip was a nice and refreshing pho broth. The sandwich is served cold, which caught me off guard but it was good. Very subtle flavors in my opinion and a fun meal. 

We also tried the smothered Japanese curry fries with a fried egg on top. A little pricey for the small portions but it was tasty!

Overall, I'm super stoked this joint opened up and I will definitely be back very soon. They just opened a few weeks ago so it wasn't too bust during lunch time. But I'm hoping business and word picks up soon!"}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli serves up some seriously solid sandwiches with a unique twist. Banh mi sandwiches have always been French and Vietnamese in their origin but seldom do you see anyone emphasize its partial French heritage. By changing the meat and offering a pho soup dip it subverts the traditions of a French onion soup by replacing it with the flavors of Vietnam while presenting it as such. Very clever and it works. This level of originality you would expect from New York or Cali, not Vegas. With Buddha Belly and District One and Other Mama, the Vegas restaurant scene is getting some real good local restaurants to call our own. Very exciting time to be eating out."}
{"text":"I generally like to visit a restaurant at least twice before writing a review, but because Buddha Belly Deli is only in their soft open phase and was so great, I wanted to show them some love.  

First off, the place looks new, clean, and welcoming for a strip mall space.  Second, we were warmly greeted as we came in.  Third, Clint was very helpful, explaining the menu as we decided what to order.

A friend and I ordered two sandwiches to share so we could try a couple different items.  We got the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy and the \"Pho Dip\", both with the house made chips and house made pickles.  I ordered the Green Tropical Tea to go with my sandwich which was very good.

The Pho Dip sanwich is really nice thin-sliced rare sirloin, bean sprouts, and jalapeños on a soft hoagie roll with a side of Pho broth for dipping.  The meat was very tender and the sandwich as a whole was so good, it did not even need to be dipped.  The pickles had a great vinegar taste that made me pucker up.  And the chips were basically perfection- light, crisp, flavorful, and not greasy.

The shrimp Po-boy was equally good.  The shrimp was breaded and fried and nestled in with some yummy marinated red peppers and jalapeños in the same soft baguette as the Pho Dip.

Once we were done, they also brought out complementary pumpkin crunch cake for us to try.  It was sinfully yummy!  Moist cake, crunchy nuts, fresh whipped cream.  Perfect ending to a great experience.

Clint advised that they will have full bakery display soon..oy!

In short, they had very good customer service and great food.  They brought our order to the table, picked up our plates when we were finished, and asked us for honest opinions several times.  We will definitely be back.

Oh and make sure to get a punch card, because your 10th entrée is free!"}
{"text":"I was really contemplating whether or not I should give the good ole' Buddha 4 or 5 stars and I thought the Pho Dip was certainly mind blowing. I am a fan of French Dip sandwiches to begin with and to add to that brisket, prime rib and Pho are some of my favorite things in general as well. This sandwich is basically all of that and a bag of chips, literally. Lol! This is truly an ingenuous concoction. Why didn't any other Vietnamese-American think of this before?! The sandwich is basically a bowl of pho in the form of a Bahn Mi. My mind was blown because I still can't believe it took something this long to be born. This is truly a Fusion dish because the dip is the Pho broth instead of typical beef au jus. In the sandwich the beef brisket tasted exactly how it does when you order it in pho. I also enjoyed the usual daikon radish, bean sprouts and cilantro. I was half way through the sandwich and started feeling the heat so I looked inside and well and behold it was the jalapeno. When I order Bahn Mis I ask for no jalapeno because I can't hang with the heat so as soon as I saw them I removed them. The only gripe I have against the sandwich was the bread. They use more of an American style hoagie rather than a French Baguette like in the traditional Bahn Mi. I actually recognized this bread and wouldn't be surprised if it was from Great Buns? I would personally love the sandwich even more if they did use more a baguette type of bread. I had the chips as my side even though I knew I should of ordered the slaw. The chips were okay, they had some type of seasoning? I wish they could of been more kettle like as in thicker, these chips were fairly thin for being house made. Since I am a dessert person I also ordered a green tea cookie and Thai Tea cupcake. I love the fact these are truly Fusion desserts. Both of desserts had more of a faint taste of the green tea/Thai tea, but I thought it was still executed very well. Let me just say I ate the cupcake the following morning, so don't judge me by thinking I ate all of this in one setting. The cashier was very nice and accommodating. I'm assuming he's the manager everyone mentions in their reviews? The inside is nice and simple, with it being a Asian minimalist look. I can't wait to come back, although the other sandwiches have mediocre reviews I will certainly try something different then go back to the Pho dip. I also will try the Thai Calm Chowder since that seems to be another favorite.

PS they have stamp cards!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner tonight I have the BBQ ribs  sandwich and the flaming french fries. Considering there was only one other person in the restaurant the service was very slow hurry the girl working the counter was friendly one cook in the back. Considering this a service I expect my food to be hot and it was just a little warmer than room temperature. The food was fine. That's it, just fine."}
{"text":"Holy cow! This food is delicious! I got the Pho Dip sandwich- no onions, jalapenos on the side so I could individualize my spice level. The sandwich was the perfect level of slightly spicy and very tasty. I got the homemade fries, which were actually a little sweet- yum! I tried the 3 sauces- Good Karma, Nirvana, and Yo Mama- I was hoping one of the three might be sweet, but all three were too spicy for me. It was okay- my food was great without extra sauce, and once the  smoke finished billowing out of my mouth, I continued enjoying it. If you like spice, definitely try them. The peach Arnold Palmer and Thai Tea were good, and they gave  us refills- how often do restaurants offer refills on Thai Tea?   :)   They have some REALLY yummy Thai Tea cookies (don't let the green color freak you out) 
  Very nice, courteous, attentive staff
  A word about the decor- someone definitely took some time putting this together. Very nicely done. And you've got to love a \"fast food\" restaurant that likes their patrons enough to treat them to real dishware. The music doesn't always entirely fit, but sometimes it does, and even when it doesn't, the songs piping through are great.
  Definitely planning to come back  :)"}
{"text":"Good for lunch or light dinner. Like the chicken salad sandwich but don't love the slaw."}
{"text":"holy crap - those sauces are hot! lol.... long ago, i may have favored the nirvana, but my favorite is good karma... not as hot, but just enough kick if it's even needed.
I ordered take out today and got the Chicken Katsu Curry and Kitchen Sink Gumbo.  The Curry was for the hubby and he was partial to it....I think he didn't like all the veggies that were hidden underneath.  I saw that they include kimchi on this plate so I asked for rice instead, but had no idea that they also have a bed of slaw underneath.  I think that dish would shine just fine with the rice, chicken, egg and curry and I thought it was okay too. I probably won't order again due to the price point for it.  The Gumbo however is a different story - this is definitely something I could see myself ordering over and over again....Yes, that one is going in my book for sure! I am definitely coming back for this one."}
{"text":"Read the great reviews and was greatly disappointed. Bread was stake food tasted odd and Chios were burnt."}
{"text":"Once again I have Yelp to thank for this find - I'm not generally a fan of Asian fusion, but Buddha Belly Deli is Asian fusion done right. The pho dip sandwich and the thai clam chowder are to die for, and I'm also a big fan of the sichuan shrimp po boy and chicken katsu club. I will say that I don't find the chips or slaw that come as a side terribly appealing, but the curry fries appetizer can fill that role quite well (although plan to share).

Don't forget to save room for dessert and try some of their cupcakes. The pineapple ones especially are super delicious."}
{"text":"I was referred by a friend of mine. I had the sloppy joe and dragon fries. Fantastic! Worth giving it a shot. Free refills on Thai tea too!"}
{"text":"Buddha Belli Delhi get in my Belly!!! Great staff, awesome menu and such great food! The Hot ass Frys were awesome, so was the Pho Dip, however my favorite so far has been the szechuan shrimp po boy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and enjoyed the food immensely!  The first time I had the pho dip sandwich with dragons breath fries. OMG sooo good the fries were good but HOT! Last night I went for sloppy Joe fries with an egg at the chefs recommendation and OMG, these were the best fries EVER! A little heat to the spice but not over whelming and we'll balanced with the meat (korean short rib that was very tender) and the egg. Sounds weird but soo worth it. I paired that with the falafel wrap which also has a little spicy heat but is also delicious. Bottom line, if you like unique Asian fusion with spice and heat at a low cost this place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"I came here hungry after riding my bike about 20 miles.  I met fellow Yelper, Chris V.  I had sent him a message to let him know when I'd be there.  

They were open at 11 when we arrived and we were the early birds in the shop.  I ordered a \"pho dip\" which the menu describes as \"Chinese Five Spice Rubbed Top Sirloin, Pickled Bean Sprouts, Red Onion, Cilantro, Basil, and Chinese Mustard Served on a Baguette with a Pho Au Jus.\"  I also ordered a Thai iced tea and  5 spice carrot cupcake with with ginger butter cream frosting.

The iced tea was very good and I was asked about a refill when I was almost finished.  That's never done without an extra charge.

The sandwich was brought to the table and the gentleman asked if I wanted some of their homemade hot sauces.  I'm always game for that and he brought three of them, Thai chili, green monster, and ghost pepper.  He stated that the Thai was the mildest one followed by the green monster.  He then urged great care with the ghost pepper.  For me, the three were good, but I made my way to the ghost pepper and when it was so good, I just spooned it all over my sandwich.  The pho for dipping became an after sandwich drink for me.

The carrot cupcake was then brought and it was very, very good. 

Service was excellent and two of the guys came at different times to the table to check on our progress and to see if we were satisfied.

Chris gave me a taste of his Szechuan shrimp po-boy and that will be something to order the next time I go.  I did forget to get a frequent customer card, but that will be next time, too!  I am a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"We went here based on a recommendation from friends and we love to support local business owners! I was the lucky recipient of their first batch of ribs! The meat was very moist & perfectly cooked. The flavor was delish!! Having Southern roots I am very picky about my potato salad & theirs was great (I just picked out the spam or ham, not sure which). Their braised greens are slightly spicy & oh so yummy!! And last but certainly not least the coconut corn bread...oh my!! I could eat a half dozen of the muffins alone!! And it was moist enough that no butter is needed! We also had the sloppy joe fries, they have a kick to them & boy are they good!! Also, clam chowder & a cheese flatbread pizza, everything was great! 

It was just over $60 with 5 drinks, free refills. For the quality, quantity & flavor you get, it was worth paying a little more that what we went in expecting."}
{"text":"Food so delicious! I had the Thai Clam Chowder and Bibimbap Burrito! Amazing!!!! Very clean and really good and fast service!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a bunch and have not wrote a review so it is long overdue.  I usually order the Pho dip and it is always consistent and full of flavor. The sloppy joe fries are also very good. I will say, you will leave satisfied and very full.  I  usually can only eat half the sandwich otherwise, I feel like I will end up looking like Buddha himself."}
{"text":"For value this place is a hard 5 stars. A lot of really creative menu items executed well."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the Thai clam chowder and the pho dip sandwich. They were incredible and the house chips are amazing!"}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall place...  Live down the street and had to try this place..  Man I'm glad I did!!!   I tried the photos dip and it was great..  I'll definitely be back for some more great items.."}
{"text":"Really great new restaurant!! I had the Dragon Breathe Fries and Asian Falafel Wrap...by far the best I've ever had, the flavors were amazing. The fries are super hot but very tasty. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Creative selection of food choices.  I had the Pho Dip and it was average but maybe just not my flavor preference.  The ingredients were quality, but I thought the flavor mixture and broth was just ok.  I also had the Dragon Breath fries which were really good, especially dipping in the kimchi ketchup.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very clean and inviting.  Overall I enjoyed the dining experience and would definitely return to try other items on their unique menu.  This place is worth a visit and I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I'm always excited when some new hip joints open in this area of town, so I definitely wanted to check out Buddha Belly. Of course I consulted yelp to see the best dishes and, according to your reviews, we ordered the Sloppy Joe fries, the pho dip, and the Szechuan shrimp po boy. 
The pho dip was good, but I wish it would have been served hot. The po boy was also really good. Both sandwiches had super soft bread and a decent amount of meat. The homemade chips were pretty good, and we didn't try the slaw. The standout of the meal was definitely the fries. They don't really taste like a typical sloppy joe because they don't have a tomato sauce, but the meat (brisket?) is really good and the sauce that's on it is not too heavy and overpowering. 
The inside is pretty boring, basically just like a Quizno's or something. My main issues with that are: 1. The prices are pretty high at $9 for a sandwich and $2+ for a drink (no fountain drinks). 2. Quizno's isn't really a destination, just something nearby or on the way. I want Buddha Belly to be a destination. 
Glad I went. I might return if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Every so often a new business arrives in Sin City and Yelpers go nuts over it. Some of these businesses are overhyped and end up under-performing.. but occasionally the business is a true gem... With regard to Buddha Belly Deli... Believe the hype!!
 
There is so much to love about Buddha Belly Deli... The food is unique and well executed... where else can you get a cross between classic clam chowder and tom ka soup? Or a pho sandwich? I have yet to find any place in Vegas serving up anything close to the Asian inspired grub found at BBD. 

I have yet to try the aforementioned pho dip, but the tom ka chowder is amazing and I have it every time I go in. My current favorite item on the menu is the chicken salad sandwich. A large serving of chicken salad made with ginger mayo, walnuts and cherries on a yummy sweet roll... Delish! 

Speaking of delicious, I can't review BBD without mentioning the dessert case. Checking out what new concoctions the guys at BBD have come up with for dessert is one of the best parts of going to BBD for me. The 5 spice carrot cupcake with ginger buttercream frosting is my current favorite... The combination of flavors is just perfection. 

Staff is passionate about their business and it shows. Every time I have gone to BBD, multiple staff have come out from the kitchen to say hello, ask how I liked my food, offer me refills on my Thai iced tea. They seem to really care that their customers are pleased with both the food and service that they receive. 

With an interesting, well executed menu and staff that are invested in ensuring that customers enjoy their experience, I don't see how BBD could be anything but successful. Quick, go visit before they get so busy that there is a wait to be seated! 

NOTE: Be sure to ask for a stamp card!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm jumping on the Buddha Belly Deli train...the folks that thought up this sandwich knew what they were doing.  The sandwich by itself was just a roast beef sandwich, the broth by itself tasted like a pho beef broth with no flavor..but together, magic happens!  Not sure if it was the pickled bean sprouts or the slight saltiness of the rare roast beef or the hint of horseradish and fresh jalapenos..but dipped in the broth, the sandwich was melt in your mouth good.

BUT, that's not even the best thing (in my opinion) on the menu!  The sloppy joe (actually a pulled pork sandwich) on a brioche bun was better tasting than the pho dip!  And their house made furikake chips were so good with their house made hot sauces I ate all my chips AND my boyfriend's!  I mixed all three of their hot sauces together and used the chips to dip it like it was salsa! It was THAT freaking good!

I second another Yelpers comment about their Kitchen Sink Gumbo..it was so good, my BF said it was worth more than the $4 we paid for it.  It had bits of spam, chinese sausage and fried chicken skin (YUM) and more..add a little bit of the ghost chili hot sauce and it was a MUST get again item!

We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"After a couple of additional visits and some critical evaluation, it's time to adjust my rating a bit on Buddha Belly Deli.

The heavily Hawaiian-influenced Asian fusion is still there. Along with flavor combinations that you may hve seen elsewhere, the Pho Dip, Thai Clam Chowder, furikake potato chips, and desserts are still highlights. But a lot of my more recent entrees (2/11/15 review for some) and the bibimbap burrito from 10/3/15 are more in the \"just\" good territory. That burrito sounded promising, and it did have a promising fried egg and nice Korean veggies, but there was far too much rice and too little meat.

Today's visit was also good, but not mindblowing. The Kitchen Sink Gumbo ($4.50) was the first part of my meal. It's a nice meat and tomato stew with a scoop of rice, but t was pretty monotonous in flavor. I was expecting more spices or possibly some sweetness, maybe because the presentation reminded me of an excellent dish called pan roast. You know what I'm talking about.

I was considering some of their newer specials (Katsu Curry Plate, Red Curry Veggie Bowl, Mochiko Chicken Sandwich, Chicken \"Laab\" Burger), but I settled on an older special in the Buddha Belly Chicken Wings ($7 for about 8 pieces). I chose the Spicy Korean variant, and thank goodness I didn't get the Extra Spicy Korean or else it would've really killed me with heat. I'll admit that it only got bad on the pieces that were loaded with the diced red chili pepper though.

Overall, the wings are very similar in flavor to the Spicy Korean Chicken at Ross J's, and I suspect that the accompanying dipping sauce is a Sriracha ranch because it complemented the sweet chicken so well. I think one of the wings may have had a bit of freezer burn, but even disregarding that, I can only rank this dish as high as one or two notches below my favorite local chicken wings (which are also Asian-influenced).

Buddha Belly Deli is still worth a first try or a revisit, even if you're across town, but I realize now that it hasn't captivated me enough for me to make frequent visits even though it's fairly close to where I live. It's a nice local lunch spot that's somewhat hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB!  I've never been to another restaurant quite like this one and I travel for a living. Last time I had the Pho Dip because it seemed to be the \"staple\" of their menu and reviews. Great sandwich.  Today I had the Sloppy Joe and it was incredible though I think it would be better named Asian BBQ.  Can't wait to come back and try another delicious bite!"}
{"text":"To cut to the chase, I give Buddha Belly Deli a solid five stars for service and four stars for the food.

Five stars - Service here is top notch. The guys are friendly and attentive.  My food and drink were delivered to me in about the same amount of time it took me to eat my meal. For me, that can be on the fast side. I was also brought three different house made sauces and told what each is. In fact, I was told about a few bits of information about the food. Like what is the seasoning on the chips. Or what comes on the dragon breath fries. See below for details. I was offered a couple of refills of my tea. And I was stopped when I tried to clear my own table. It seemed as though I was eating and a casual dining sit-down sort of restaurant but it looks like a fast food place. It was really a pleasent dining experience. You can tell the guys behind the counter are enjoying what they do and care for the customers. That kind of subtle attitude goes a long way.

Four stars - today, on my first visit to the Buddha Belly Deli, I ordered a Katsu Chicken Club sandwich, a side of Dragon Breath Fries and a tropical green tea. The prices seemed high at first but upon seeing the portions, I was swayed. 
°The sandwich came with two perfectly crisp pieces of Katsu Chicken, thick cut and perfectly cooked strips of bacon, shredded lettuce and a tomato slice. There was also some Asian BBQ sauce on the bun. Over all, a tasty sandwich to be sure. I could have gone for a bit more BBQ sauce though. To my final bite I added a dab of the special kimche (?) ketchup that came with the Dragon Breath Fries. Also a house made pickle chip that came on the side. With those two added to the crisp chicken, perfection. 
°The chips on the side were obviously house made which should be a nice touch. But honestly, I don't care much for chips whether fresh or mass produced. What I did like was the seasoning. I guessed the seaweed, salt and pepper. I asked to comfirm this and was informed there is sugar on them too.  The chip seasoning would be great on some fries, IMO. 
°As for the side of Dragon Breath Fries, appropriately named. It is two hours later as I write this and I can still taste the garlic. These little shoe strings were covered in garlic and Thai peppers and totally delicious. Dipped in the ketchup there were even better. 
°Finally the house made sauces. I was brought three different sauces of varied intensity. The first was a Thai chili sauce. It has a good medium heat with a nice peppery flavor. There was a green pepper sauce that was my favorite. Not too hot with a bit of a tart tomatillo note. I used this on the chips more than any other sauce. The third and final sauce, actually the first I tried and the last I used before leaving, was a ghost chili sauce. It is deceptively sweet and fruity up front. Then the heat hits you as you swallow. It reminds me of habanero peppers. Good but only in limited quantities for me.

Its a good thing Buddha Belly Deli is not closer to home. I would be too tempted to spend all of my hard earned money on sandwiches and maybe even the smothered fries. I have yet to try those. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Literally addicted to the furikake kettle chips. The pho dip is my favorite (it really legitimately tastes like pho) but the katsu club and bbq pork sandwich were both great too. The pumpkin crunch cupcakes are kind of addictive."}
{"text":"A much needed departure from the uninspiring deli sub of yesteryear. The guys who run this place, own this place - and it shows in their dedication to customer service and great tasting food. Everything here is made in-house and tastes very fresh.

My fiancé and I tried the Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy and the Chicken Katsu Club. Both sandwiches were delicious. They had a hint of sweet/spicy behind their individual flavor. 
The shrimp wasn't rubbery, like many places and had good flavor. The chicken was high quality chicken breast, a nice change from the cheaper cuts of chicken that is usually used in katsu. The bacon was thick and crispy. The bread was fresh & awesome! I also like that the slaw wasn't made with mayo.

Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Price 4/5

The prices are on the high side of average, e.g. $9 for a club, but well worth it for the quality. I definitely recommend this place and will be returning soon. I can't wait to try their Sloppy Joe (Braised Short rib) and Chicken Katsu Curry!

Hope this review is helpful :) I have used Yelp for a long time, but this is my FIRST review - that should say something."}
{"text":"Found a new spot! Well I guess it's not new to others because it has so many good reviews already. This place deserves all the praise that it's been getting. 

First off it's nice inside, clean, and inviting. 
I went two days in a row because first It was delicious, and second because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke. No fluke. 

First day ordered the pho dip. As good as all the reviews have been saying. Ordered my wife the shrimp po boy and it was very tasty/delicious/not greasy or weird or anything like that at all. Both sandwiches were delicious!

Second day ordered the sloppy joe and the 808 flatbread. This place keeps coming with flavor. Both were perfect. 

It's real simple. It's a must try. You should even go out of your way for this place, and oh yea, the potato chips are amazing."}
{"text":"Based on previous reviews and convenience off the highway, we decided to head here.  As we got there Friday mid afternoon into this strip mall, the place was empty.  We ordered the dragon fries, pho dip, and shrimp po boy.  The dragon fries came out first and the server/chef said that the kimchi ketchup was made in-house.  I don't really like ketchup but this was made really well and added a touch of vinegar instead of simply being spiced with dried pepper.  My pho dip was quite good since the dip was made with pho with a healthy dose of anise.  The shrimp po boy was quite crunchy with a firm roll instead of a yeast soft roll or crunchy italian loaf.  The hot sauces were a bit too much for us since they start out quite hot and get hotter.  They had a bulletproof monk coffee (butter and coconut milk) which I wish I had tried but their desserts are also quite appealing.  We'll have to come back for those since our meal was so filling!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite deli place close to my home! Very unique and delicious sandwiches with Asian twist. They also give u a refill when your order Thai iced tea! Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Just stopping through for work and looked for something with good reviews nearby. I loved the name of this place, not gonna lie, so I mapped it and drove straight there. There were a few business types stopping by for lunch and I waited in line to order at the counter. I couldn't decide between two flat breads but ended up getting the Asian BBQ one and a Thai tea. They were super friendly and nice. Checked on me and refilled my tea while I ate and topped it off before I left. I really liked it here and would definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Four stars overall. Service was fast, staff was friendly, and food was a great fusion. Four stars only because I didn't think it was a \"wow.\" It was good, felt satisfied, but would not necessarily develop a craving for it."}
{"text":"Had the pho dip, ginger-scallion flat bread and Thai clam chowder. Wow to all three. Fresh made and delicious. The flavors are all bright and fun. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great little fusion deli with the best customer service staff!  Even before we ask, the staff noticed and ask if we would like a refilled our Thai Tea.  Where can you get that great attentive service?

And the food is absolutely delicious!  Potato chips made in house!  

Will be back to try all their menu items on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy!! Seriously though, this ain't your typical sandwich shop. Just as the name suggests, it's a fusion of Asian inspired deli delicacies...say what?! 

I've only been here twice and both times I've left in a euphoric food coma. My first visit I ordered the Pho Dip. That's right...imagine thinly sliced pho meat piled high and topped with jalapeños and sprouts sandwiched between a fresh, soft bun served with a delightful pho a jus. My mouth is watering writing this.  : ) The sandwich is served with your choice of coleslaw or their freshly fried chips. I went with the chips...SCORE!!! I'm not sure what they season them with, but I could eat them all day long, no joke. On my second visit I ordered...the exact same thing! I guess that means it is BOMB!! 

Although I've only personally ordered the one sandwich, I did sample both of my BF's choices: the Shrimp Po Boy and the Katsu Chicken. No joke, both of these were delightful as well!! We did end up splitting the curry fries. I didn't think that I was a big curry fan, but these fries converted me! 

If you're in search of a new place to grab some unique delicious food, make a trip asap. You're Buddha belly won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"It took me a little while to realize I had been to this eatery in its former life (East Coast Eats) and in the spirit of Buddhism, I like this new rebirth/reincarnation of this location much better.

What got me in the door was seeing that they had Pho dip. So my boyfriend and I ordered one to share with a side of dragon breath fries. 

The Pho dip sandwich is such a cool concept and I thought it was pretty refreshing. The fries had an intense level of spice and they tasted great paired with the kimchi ketchup. 

On top of that, the service was great. Way better than you expect from a fast casual place. They kept everything clean, discussed how they put dried seaweed on their chips, and refilled our Thai tea. Super nice touch."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  There is something on his menu for everyone.  It's a small menu, but that's because they don't half ass anything.  Whether you like Thai, Korean, Vietnamese or Chinese there is something you will fall in love with here.  My personal recommendation is the Bibimbap burrito."}
{"text":"What happened Buddha Belly? I came here a couple of months ago and gave a 5, after my last meal here I don't know if they deserve even 3 stars. 
Katsu Curry: A plate of katsu with curry poured over it (Japanese style), a sunny side up egg on top and a mound of rice off to the side. It was WEIRD. The katsu and curry didn't taste good without the egg, but at the same time the egg didn't go with it. The meat of the katsu was fine, but the taste of the curry was off. And the rice was dry- an absolute turn off for my Japanese self. I think calling it katsu curry was misleading. Maybe change the name to katsu with curry? Or katsu with curry sauce? It just wasn't what I expected. 
The bbq flat bread.......... Cheap tasting bbq sauce on some pita bread with asian pork on top? It was so bad that we each only took a bite. It was pretty unedible. 
The dragon flies were A LOT spicier than the first time I had them. The girl warned me they were spicy, but she didn't tell me my mouth would die. I'm not a weakling when it comes to spice, but I couldn't get through a quarter of these fries without tearing up and needing to drink down multiple cups of water. 

Maybe I just didn't order the right things... The shrimp po-boy that I had before was good.... What happened to the rest of your menu, guys? :("}
{"text":"We love this place! Had the clam chowder, Phu sandwich and Dragon fries. Spicy, fresh and beyond flavorful! We will be back next time I visit my BFF in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Finally able to try this restaurant.  I've heard about it through FB.  We made a point to visit during our business travel to LV.  This place did not disappoint! The food was flavorful and amazing.  Our favorite was the Thai clam chowder. We finished our meal with yummy cupcakes and green tea cookie.  Service was very friendly and the restaurant has a great vibe"}
{"text":"We have tried all the major things on the menu and there isn't one thing we don't like. Love love the shrimp po boy and the chicken katsu club! Love the pho dip! Its crazy how it tastes like pho but in a sandwich, amazing!  Curry fries - delish!  Get the chips too they make them and they are super yummy and extra thin and crispy!"}
{"text":"I don't know how exactly to review when everything was perfect... My daughter order the Pho dip... you HAVE TO HAVE IT!!! I had the Chicken Salad sandwich ( you have to have it!) and was worried about the nuts, I'm not allergic, I just dont like nuts.  \"Don\" let me know that they make it right when you ask for it and so they can just omit nuts. YEAHHHH!!!  Ok, so the pictures of the food are accurate, and food I didn't see first was more awesome then I expected...  Even the flavor of my tea hit me with PEACHY PEACH greateness!! LOL... we have been looking for a good food experience for several weeks, and *sigh* we are at the end end of the rainbow honey... finger wave Yaaaassssss!!! 

Shout out to \"Mark\" my new friend (in my head)
We actually drove here for the Hummingbird cupcake and they didnt have them anymore, but I won't be leaving disappointed!!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Wow... This place is so good!  I have never written a review before but felt I had to after my experience here!  I just had the Pho Dip Sandwich which was amazing.  The broth smelled and tasted just like pho and once you dip the sandwich in it your taste buds scream for more.  Oh and did I mention the chips, kimchi pickles, and green tea cookies... Yum!  It's a definite must try,  not only is the food amazing but everyone behind the counter was very friendly and helpful.  I know I will be back for more because I want to try it all!"}
{"text":"So you're telling me there is a pho influenced sandwich? How do you combine this post drunk elixir with a sandwich? This is when I had to investigate...

Asian fusion has been pretty popular lately with such restaurants like Bachi burger and KoMex really making this new food fad popular.  Buddha Belly does make it's mark with me but probably not as big as the two mentioned above.

Service: I was greeted by a buff asian guy who was pretty nice.  I ordered sparkling water and by courtesy offered me a cup filled with ice for it. 

Food: The sandwich is presented with all the typical things you'd find with your pho.  It was a medium rare sirloin with jalapenos, cilantro and sprouts accompanied by a pho broth your \"Au Jus\" to dip in.  I found that this not only warmed up the meat in the sandwich but also made the bread absorb the broth as well so you'd essential be eating and having soup at the same time! (i call it sponge sandwiches).  

Overall: The pho dip was definitely something very different and tasted very similar to a hot bowl of pho.  I'd be careful not to eat here too often or else you might find  yourself having a buddha belly."}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop in GV. They put little twists on traditional dishes such as gumbo and French dips (Kitchen Sink Gumbo, Pho Dip). Friendly service, cute decor and nice freshly prepared food."}
{"text":"So I write this review hoping next time to at least raise it up a star.  I come in and the place has a good vibe, and I am excited about this Asian deli fusion.  My boyfriend and I split the pho dip, clam chowder, Dragon breathe fries, and a Thai ice tea.  It's confusing mixture of serve your self and be served.  They had all these sauces on a table near the enterance as well as silverware and other accoutrements.  I wish they had some type of caddy to take it all to your table.  I kept having to make little trips to gather it all up like a squirl storing nuts for winter or something. 

 The Thai ice tea was the only item I just did not like at all.  It had this weird artificial clashing taste I assume was in the cream portion.  I normally love Thai ice tea.  After that everything was good but not crave worthy.  The pho dip needed some extra punch to it maybe in the broth itself, although the meat itself was good quality, nice and pink.  The pickles that came with it were great though. The Thai clam chowder just tasted like they took some basic Thai kitchen red curry paste and mixed it in a chowder.  The flavor profile lacked depth.  The Dragon breath fries were my favorite definitely spicy and garlicky.  Each fry had something on it which I appreciate, and was full of flavor.  The dip tasted like cocktail sauce, and I feel that another dip option to smooth out the spicyness or add a little sweetness like pinapple would have taken it to the next level.

  Over all, if I'm coming from that side of town and am hungry, I'll try them out again and see if something else on the menu speaks to me more so."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I just made into this place and they are closing. What a gem!

The girl that took our orders and brought them to the table was very friendly. She was taking and delivering orders for everyone and keeping a friendly attitude while doing so.

We ordered the Chicken Katsu Club and Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy. One with the slaw and the other with the homemade chips. The Chicken Katsu Club was my favorite. The chicken had a really nice crispy breading and there was plenty of chicken on the club. The sauce on the club was yummy too. The Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy flavor caught me off guard at first because it was very unique, but I ended up enjoying the sandwich. The shrimp on this also had a nice, light breading. The chips were great and the seasoning was nice. The slaw was pretty good.

I'm sorry to hear that this restaurant is closing. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try before they close!"}
{"text":"Pho dip is my fav!!! Savory and delicious. We also tried the shrimp po boy. I was in love with the pho dip that I didn't pay attention to the other sandwich. But my hubby said its good. We also got the amazing short rib fries with egg. When it was served to us the egg yolk was broken, so they gave us another egg that was perfectly cooked on a separate plate! How awesome is that! Showing they take pride in what they serve. Cool place, chill vibe, clean and everyone who works there is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful small restaurant to try out some fusion favors I haven't experienced before.  Their sandwiches are well worth the price. I had the chicken Katsu burger, which was amazing.  I love that they made their own chips in house, which are some fantastic chips.  If you want to try any soup, they will let you.  We tried the Thai clam chowder, and had to get a bowl of it. Their flavor combinations are delicious. It has become a place where we bring visitors to, and will most likely be coming back several times a month."}
{"text":"I had the pho dip sandwich with dragon breath fries (spicy but good ) and Thai Iced tea - just what the Belly needed. Great portions and very creative menu.  I will certainly be back for more.  Customers service on point and very friendly owners - felt welcomed to their establishment.  Just a great small eatery.  It's in Henderson so it was a bit of a trek - I will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"Ditto to what all the Yelpers said. Henderson has been blessed by the Buddha. This is the \"Tao\" of what a successful local eatery should be.

5 stars well deserved when everything that is ordered is AMAZEBALLS! The menu offers enough to have variety but not too much to overwhelm.

I've finally found a restaurant that caters to people who like it really hot. They have GHOST PEPPER (one of the hottest chilis on earth) and the Green Monster (crushed Thai green chilis) condiments on the table to up the spice factor. HOLY HEAT HEAVEN!!

Dragon Breath Fries - you must get these. The best, crispiest fries with a spicy chili seasoning served with a chili ketchup. Good to share, and spicy enough to keep some grubby hands at bay :) 

Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy - Generous amount of good sized shrimp, fried to light crispy perfection and served with the thinnest potato chips seasoned with furikake and throw in some housemade pickles, this item is sure to satisfy that crunch monster.

The others in our party ordered the Pho Dip Sandwich that is the perfect homage to traditional pho flavors with piled on tender beef brisket, the Asian Falafel wrap was a big winner with my father-in-law who never eats, but happily devoured his wrap, daughter had the Thai clam chowder which left us all wondering why these flavors have never met before.

We are all looking forward to coming back to BBD soon and making it a favorite family spot."}
{"text":"Meaning to check this one out for awhile. Originally BBD only had one location, but has since expanded to Henderson. While I was out in H-Town I stopped by for a tasty lunch after a mani/pedi session. 

I ordered exactly what have been thinking about ever since I saw the first reviews of BBD - The Pho Dip. As you can tell by my rating, it did not disappoint. This fresh take on regular pho was damn good. Sandwiched between pieces of nice, white, fluffy baguette you get top sirloin beef, bean sprouts, red onion, basil, and a Chinese mustard. You also get cilantro, but I asked for them to leave it out. And then... you get the pho (soup/broth) which is used as your au jus. Brilliant! And actually, better than a regular French Dip? I mean don't get me wrong, I LOVE a French dip, and obviously the au jus of each offers different tastes, BUT man the Pho dip was amazing.

You also get the choice of fries or slaw that has a peanut sauce base. I went with the slaw - great choice! So tasty and different. Although I was told the fries are homemade as well, so I am sure they are jus as good.

I love the condiment bar with their varying sauce and they offer cool lemon water for dining in as well. 

The place is on the smaller side, but it is clean and service is attentive, even though they don't really have a server per say -- the cashier checked on me during my meal to ask how it was and offered me a to go container without me having to ask. 

Overall I wish this place were closer to me, because I would certainly be back more often."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Thai Clam Chowder was tasty as well the Pho Sandwich.  Service was outstanding!  Def coming back..."}
{"text":"Yumm! Valle Verde was in need of some good places to eat! They have a great menu here, my boyfriend and I got the Dragon fries, Pho Dip, and Shrimp Po Boy   everything was delicious and came out quickly. We have already been back a few times since our original visit definitely one of our new go-to places!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite recent discoveries.  I will drive across town when the craving strikes.  between my husband and my children, we have sampled everything on the menu and nothing has managed to fail us.  I do feel the food is a little heavy on the salt, but I think it's really about what you order.  The Sloppy Joe french fries are amazing and probably the fave on the menu.  Not to mention they give you unlimited thai tea refills.  A must eat for anyone who enjoys asian/island fusion."}
{"text":"What a total surprise to find this hot spot with delicious food from soup to sandwich to yummy desert . . . excellent excellent food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent. The serving size is more than enough to satisfy you and leave you with some leftovers afterwards. I ordered the Chicken Katsu Club, and when the cashier asked for what side I wanted she suggested that I go with the \"Sloppy Joe Fries\" and I decided to go ahead and do that. After I paid for everything I get approached by what seems to be the owner and tells me that they don't offer the fries as a side and I had to do a full order of them so I had to go back up to the register and pay for the up-charge. It would have been nice if they would have just honored the order under THEIR mistake."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile. They had lots of specials, tasty and interesting drinks, and vegetarian options. I got both veg. Sandies. I wanna try the bullet proof coffee next...the Thai tea was bomb and free refills!"}
{"text":"I recently move to Southern Highlands and searching for a good sandwich. Tried this once so far and was not disappointed.  Excellent flavor and unique experience.  I can't wait to try more of their menu. Each time I come in I eat something creative and tasty. This place is a staple."}
{"text":"amazing unusual flavors all put together well.  owner goes out of way for his customers
 friendly place and nice tunes."}
{"text":"First visit to this place and it was off the hook.  Now the clarification.  We ordered food to go, the Thai Clam Chowder, the Dragon Fries, a Chicken sandwich and two Pho Dip sandwiches.  

The food is SPICY there is no doubt about that.  The fries were AWESOME, spicy, garlicky, everything they said they would be ...YES I love spicy food.  The Pho Dip's were AMAZING.  I love French Dip Sandwiches but this one with the twist they put on it was a really amazing sandwich and to me beats any French Dip you will find in this town.

The chicken sandwich was good I am told but the chicken did have the fatty part of the skin on it which was a turn off for the person eating it.  

The claim chowder with the Thai twist I am told was very spicy as well and they were not able to eat it because of the spice level but said the soup itself did have a good taste if not for the spice.

Some can hang and some cannot.  I will visit this place again as there are other items on the menu I would like to try.   This is a place if you like spice, you should definitely try.  If you don't like spice, stop and talk to the guys there and see if they can take it down a notch although in my opinion that would defeat the purpose of their food but overall it was amazing and I will be back."}
{"text":"Good eats at a good price.  Something different in a sea of knock-off deli's and meat and cheese palaces.  Attentive service after the food was delivered even though it's counter service.  Sandwiches were tasty and the spicy fries were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food with unique flavors! I definitely recommend that everybody come here and check it out!!"}
{"text":"Had the pho dip was recomended by my brother and glad i tried very good home made chips were awsome as well. Will defiantly come back when in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"CUPCAKES!  I had the tropic thunder cupcake and it was the best cupcake I have ever had.  This cupcake had the perfect combination of lychee, mango, and pineapple with a moist crumbly cake and buttercream frosting.  This was a way better cupcake than the other places that charge twice as much and only make cupcakes.

I am a big fan of the savory food at this place too.  The potato chips and slaw are top notch, it's hard to choose which you want as your side, so I get both.  Prices are very competitive and the food is very fresh.

Hopefully, they can expand to the West side because I think they would do very well in Summerlin."}
{"text":"So yummy! We ordered the Thai Chowder, The Pho Dip, The Short Rib Fries and Peach & Thai Tea! Everything was super good! The lady working that day couldn't have been nicer and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The decor is so adorable. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They explained all the food and options. Had the Japanese Curry Fries with a fried egg and they were amazing! O'man best curry fries I've had in a long time. I had the 'Pho Dip' and it was super tasty with a fun Asian twist. My hubby had the Philly Cheese Steak 'Pho Dip' which was even better. Their homemade chips are fantastic as well. Can't say enough positive things about this place!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazeballs! My friend kept telling me about this place and that I HAD to try it out for a while now. And finally, I went with another friend of mine and we absolutely fell in love with this restaurant! We ordered the sloppy joe fries (which is so friggin' good), I had the chicken katsu club sandwich (soooooo good) and my friend had the falafel wrap and she loved it. I am so glad my friend told me about this place because the food is just amazing and freshly cooked. And the drinks too! I'd definitely recommend trying the bulletproof coffee if you haven't already, it's so much better than freshly brewed coffee most people are used to drinking. On top of that, bulletproof coffee gives you a really nice balanced energy throughout the day, unlike regular coffee or energy drinks where you're energized for a few hours and then crash. Anyways, I loved this place so much, that I came back here the day after with my sister to try out and she really liked it as well. The 2nd time, I tried the pho dip, and I thought that one was pretty good, it's not amazing but I still enjoyed it. And omg don't even get me started with the house made chips, those are to die for! This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great new place right off of the 215. They make everything in house and do an awesome job. The food is made with love and there is a nice variety. We had the soup of the day, which was a thai coconut curry clam chowder which was nice and brothy and was not all thick. The pho dip was really tasty with thinly shaved rare roast beef and pho broth that takes 8 hours to make. The bbq pork sandwich was on a sweet roll with delicious pickled carrot and daikon. The potato chips and pickles were also a nice touch on the side with both sandwiches. There was also a nice assortment of desserts along with a variety of Hawaiian and various Asian canned and bottled beverages. The portions will fill you up for sure. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were looking for something for a light lunch and this Asian fusion restaurant came to mind.  We each order a bowl of the Thai clam chowder - clam chowder prepared with coconut milk and healthy douse of heat fit the bill.  Of note, the small staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I just HAD to try BBD because Yelpers are going bonkers over this new spot. I'm a little over Asian Fusion, but the menu is intriguing and I love the concept of a deli with an Asian twist. Plus, the food looks great!

We brought our friends from Hawaii and our initial impression with the cashier wasn't great - we weren't offered stamp cards nor asked if we had one; my friend had to request it. But, that was easily forgiven, especially since the service during our meal was phenomenal. Someone came to check on us a few times, offered a free refill of Iced Thai Tea for my friends, and quickly cleared our table when we were finished.

Thai Clam Chowder ($3.50): This was easily the best thing we tried. The chowder wasn't crazy thick, it was filled with lots of goodies, and the flavors were great. The bowl wasn't big enough!

\"Pho Dip\" ($9): Our friends ordered this as well and they loved it. So did Ruben. I did not enjoy it at all. The sandwich itself was boring and the soup/au jus added nothing. It was bland. I didn't even finish my half. The Housemade Furikake Chips that accompanied the sandwich was delicious though. Great chips and loved the flavor.

Szechuan Shrimp Po Boy ($9): The shrimp were good (nice batter) and I really liked the Szechuan twist, however, it needed a lot more flavor or something because it lacked that \"umami\" experience. If it had that extra oomph, I'd be all over it.

Thai Red Curry Flatbread ($9): Again, it lacked a punch of flavor! There was not nearly enough curry, which was extremely disappointing given its name. So, it tasted like a vegetable and cheese (SO much cheese) pizza with a hint of something that could be curry. The vegetables were fresh and cooked well.

Dragon Breath Fries ($4): Most importantly, the fries are good. I loved the copious amounts of garlic and chilies. It burned so good. Delicious.

Coconut Butter Mochi ($2): Yum! Great texture, chew, and flavor. Exactly what you want in butter mochi.

Overall, I wasn't entirely impressed and disappointed because of my obviously high expectations. Where was the flavor in so many of the dishes? I love the menu concept and there are a couple great items, so I'm willing to give them another chance. Plus, I'd love to have that chowder again!

Extra notes: There are three chili sauces (Bad Karma, Nirvana, and Good Karma; in order of spiciest to mildest). All made in-house! The Bad Karma is not messing around! Also, they have a specials board and secret menu items - I saw them on their Instagram. The stamp card program - stamps are awarded for purchases of sandwiches, entree salads, or flatbreads. Purchase nine and the 10th one is free."}
{"text":"I love this place. I work right across the street and we've ordered it twice for lunch. The other people in the office don't \"get it\". They think it's a weird fusion. I get it and I love it. The green tea white chocolate cookies are sinfully delicious. I get the wrap with chicken instead of tofu. I just wish they could figure it a way to drain it so it didn't get so soggy so fast. That's really my only complaint. I love their salads. My husband tried the curry chicken plate, it was delicious. He said \"Why is the first time you're bringing me here.\" It's on the pricey side if you're just grabbing a quick lunch, but it's good enough that I splurge. Try it. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place just opened and I must say... The food was delicious! I went with a few friends and we ordered a bunch of stuff to try. The faves were the pho dip, the Thai clam chowder and the Szechuan shrimp po boy.  They also had amazing sides such as the dragon breath fries and the house made furikake chips! I am definitely gonna be a regular here."}
{"text":"Ok I'm sipping my bulletproof monk coffee; and I'm a coffee snob... Starbucks just doesn't make the cut in my world! This coffee is outstanding! If my meal is anything like my first sip I will so be back!! Oh and the people working here are so pleasant it's such a nice change!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of those quant out of the ordinary cafes you gotta try. I've been wanting to try this place for a while and decided to check it out since it was close to home and had so many good reviews. 

The Shrimp Po Boy seemed to be the best first try due to all the great reviews so I decided to have that. Oh man! Yes, it was a great choice and was expertly crafted. The shrimp was tender and not over cooked. The friendly gal taking my order, let me know ahead of time, the sauce that is a little spicy, but it was just right for me on a scale of 1 - 10, it was a 5. The Cole Slaw was fresh and the Black Mango Ice Tea was excellent. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is perfect.

I highly recommend if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Had the pho dip and it was delicious.  Also tried the flat pork sandwich which had lots of flavors and textures going on.   The chips are the best dam thing ever!"}
{"text":"New favorite place !  I highly recommend the Thai clam chowder and the shrimp po-boy."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and have REALLY enjoyed the food! The deli is Asian or Thai themed amd the environment is clean and inviting. I love the Thai clam chowder and the gumbo is never a bad option (large portion for an appetizer). Pho dip and the Pork Roll are the only things I've tried on the menu....want to try something new but they are soo good!! Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and the dishes are very creative! I have not found one item on the menu that I don't love."}
{"text":"Just passing through, but found this amazing place. Very original eats and very yummy. They had something most places miss these days...Great service! From the time I walked in the guy greeting us was warm and welcoming. Very helpful for us newbies to figure out what we wanted to eat. After ordering, fast and friendly service. Figured out what I needed before I even knew I needed it. Although it is more of a \"serve yourself\" type of place, he checked on us several times. Now, the good part, the food. I had the Asian Falafel Wrap. Original combination of Asian slaw, chickpea falafel and potatoes. Very tasty. Also furikake chips...yummmm too! My friend had Chicken Katsu plate with a sunny side up egg on top. He said his was delicious and he cleaned his plate. I was tempted to try one of their original desserts too, but was too full to try. The place is clean. I would definitely come back again. If you haven't, it is a must try."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp po-boy, with homemade baked chips.  Sandwich was pretty good, the chips were rather salty. Will have to try the coleslaw next time.  Will try it again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Buddha Belly is my reward for suffering through my nearby physical therapy sessions. We've been here several times and tried menu items as well as specials. I highly recommend trying a few things from the specials board. We had a seafood cheesecake, fried brussel sprouts, and veggie curry--all delicious. 

Off the menu we've tried both types of wraps, a flatbread pizza, a few sandwiches, and the chowder (one of my favorites). Portions are generous.

They also have great deserts like green tea cookies! 

As a bonus, the staff is always nice. Today the chef came around to all the tables and gave everyone samples of their new special--vegetarian chicken wings--which is fried cauliflower in a sweet and spicy sauce. I love that they always try new things and experiment."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at BBD last night. Asian inspired deli favorites done right, by people who care about their product. The short rib red curry pizza was a great combination of flavors. The shrimp po boy was very good and the house made chips were amazing. My only complaint is I wish it was closer so I could try the entire menu."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Buddha Belly Deli and it was perfect. 

As soon as I walked in I was immediately greeted by Jaz at the counter. She was so fun and very informative with the menu and even offered up some helpful suggestions. May not sound like much, but the 5 minutes I spent making my selection with her was a great start to an epic lunch, especially because I wasn't rushed.

The dining room was vibrant and stimulating with all the red walls and charming murals; I can't forget to mention the oriental lanterns, they were a fun touch to the decor. I don't know about you, but I like kitchens that open to the dining space, I feel like the food is respected more and I love seeing happy chefs (You can taste how good their day is; Today was a good one for sure).

I ended up getting their signature dish, the Pho Dip sandwich. I love Pho, so this was and great take on an old favorite. The sandwich had the rare meat that we all love under a bed of fresh bean sprouts crowned with jalapenos. The bread was freshly warmed and was a nice contrast to the chilled meat inside. On the side, they give you searing hot pho broth with  chopped cilantro & scallions to dip the sandwich in that leaves a succulent film of flavor in your mouth....MMMM, I have to go back for dinner.  On the other side of this two-handed sandwich, you get to choose between their Slaw (which they make in-house and contains no mayo) or the fresh thick-cut chips that have freshly cracked pepper & salt along with other delightful seasonings.

After finishing my meal, Jaz was quick to clear my table and chat with my date I about our experience. I could tell she has passion for what she does and the products Buddha Belly Deli offer. I wish I would have had room for one of the pastries displayed in the window, but I guess I have to settle for another visit.

If you consider yourself a foodie and want to experience a great meal, try this place. It's perfect for a lunch, dinner, or even a casual date. Happy eats and thank you Buddha Belly Deli!"}
{"text":"Can I just say how amazing these guys are? When I went in, I didn't even realize it was just their soft opening until this weekend. They had the best customer service, and each person working came up to us to see how we were doing. It was all smiles! Very welcoming crew. 

We tried a few things on the menu, and everything was delicious. My fave was the pho dip. I mean, whoa...creative! Super fkn good too! Their homemade chips were the best chips I've had as well! Those smothered fries were pretty great. I don't know why, but an egg on some fries is always good. 

Also had the pork roll sandwich and the ginger scallion flat bread. Got a taste of them, and I swear they were on their \"A\" game. After we licked our plates clean, they brought us some green tea cream covered brownies. Dude... Yes. 

They're gonna kill it once everyone else hears about them. I'm telling my buds, stat! 

Only thing I was upset about.... was that its in Henderson. Too far! Or else I'd come by every week. Lol."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place. Pho Dip...genius! Who would've known to combine 2 of my faves together; pho and beef dip? And it worked very well!  It was soo delish, I'm definitely going to be back.  They have three different sauces you can add to your meal on top of the counter.  Can't remember the names of each but there were two green sauces and one red sauce.  You DEFINITELY gotta try ALL 3 sauces.  I made sure I took the sauce to go along with my Pho Dip.  Service was very friendly.  After looking over the menu I realized they offered ALL my faves but in just such a unique way that works better than the norm."}
{"text":"Well, I REALLY wanted to love this restaurant, but the food fell slightly short for me.  My friend and I met up for dinner here last night and we both got the strawberry lemonades (delicious! and he gave us free refills!).  I ordered the pho dip with chips and also a bowl of the kitchen sink gumbo.

The gumbo had a good flavor but really needed some salt. I wanted to add some in, but the tables don't have individual salt/pepper shakers.  They have a community counter where you can get all your sauces and extra salt/pepper, but the salt shaker was completely empty. 

The pho dip has SO MUCH potential!  The bread is so yummy. It has a slight crisp on the outside and is soft on the inside. The meat tastes really fresh and even though it's pretty rare, it doesn't have that raw meat taste. It comes with onions, peppers and cilantro. By itself, it just really needed a little more.  Maybe some of that asian slaw to complete it.  I do understand it being more simple since you have the pho broth to dip it in, however, my pho broth had ZERO flavor.  Some lime and fish sauce would've done wonders for the flavor.  

The chips are house made and sprinkled with furikake. They are yummy!  My friend got the falafel wrap because she's a vegetarian and she was in LOVE with it.  She will probably give her review 5 stars.

I am definitely open to trying it out again. Maybe they are still working on perfecting their flavors and seasoning.  The service was stellar, the place is clean and there's a sort of energetic and upbeat atmosphere to it.  I just wish my food had more salt."}
{"text":"As always super good. Sloppy joe fries with fried egg, chicken katsu, and BBQ pork sandwich. We also tried the white pizza for the first time and it was very good. Thin crust and light. Vietnamese coffee to top it off, great meal."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! 
Very creative and super tasty!!
Their gumbo is like a warm blanket wrapped around you. Comes with a side of jasmine rice.
Great comfort food
Amazing service and attention to detail
Healthy options when you wanna stick to your diet and enjoy the food you are eating. Gorgeous presentation on the food and pretty garnishes. Delicious cheat day foods when you wanna eat amazing sweets and culinary delights.  Cupcakes are to die for!! Please support this amazing small business. Diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Recently went vegan and was looking for places in Henderson that had suitable options. Not only is their Asian Falafel Wrap out of this world, the folks behind the counter are super personable and friendly. They also have a frequent flyer card they'll punch for you each visit. They also have non-vegan options and a fantastic menu. It's definitely my go-to option if I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Late review. So from what I remember my boyfriend loooved the 9th island pizza. The kitchen gumbo soup was good and we both loved the smothered fries. We'll be coming back to try the smothered fries with and egg on it! And service was great. Very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Still a total five star place! I love Buddha even more because they have rockin' desserts! I'm so not a sweet person, but the Ginger Buttercream Carrot cupcake is amazing. 
A must try as well is their Clam Chowder! Yummy! 

I said it before this place melds flavors like no body else!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and thought I'd see if East Coast Eats was still in business.  No, they aren't.  In their place is ... Buddha Belly Deli?  Before driving off, I thought I'd check Yelp and what do you know, there was a reliable Yelp friend's review raving about the place.  Never mind it was between lunch and dinner and I wasn't actually hungry, I just had to try the Dragon's Breath Fries. 

OMG, so good!  And only $4 for a big serving!  They toss crispy french fries in their chili sauce and garlic.  And served with kimchee flavored ketchup.  Yummy!  But the chili sauce packs a kick.  Ate more than 1/2 of the large serving and felt the burn in my mouth.  Had to go get a Slurpee after that.  Then finished the fries and finished the rest of the slurpee.  My mouth burned for more than 30 minutes but it was SO worth it.

Can't wait to return to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and saw it got 4.5 star. Based on these rating I really wanted to see if it was really that good.  I ordered the pho dip and a little extra dragon breath french fries.  It came out around 11 dollars. The food came out quick and with a smile, it was pretty dead so no cookie points there for quick service.  The sandwich was average nothing to go crazy over, but for almost ten dollar I expected the pho soup dip to taste like real pho. The dip tasted like can pho with extra hot water to fill the bowl. You guys need to learn how to cook real pho or otherwise change it to adjous dip or something. Calling it pho dip is quite misleading IMHO. The dragon fries was also mediocre; just quite drab and a pain to eat, but I will not knock it for is spice level. May I suggest you guys take some pointers from the boiling crab's fries. FYI I had to toss half the fries away. The only enjoyable items were the free water and the interesting sauces by the counter. This review was for the pho dip and fries only. I will not return unless I'm in the neck of the wood and only to try some other items. Overall I'm very disappointed in my first impression of this joint."}
{"text":"Can't decide between Asian food or American food? This place puts both ideas on each plate. 

Whether you're craving Thai spices, or a sandwich and just can't decide what the belly wants more....just come to this spot! 

The interior is decorative and impeccably clean. Owners, ridge and mark, are personable. They take time to explain the food and the thought behind each dish. They ask for feedback from
Their guests to continually serve and cater to the people for the people. Awesome experience. 

Im not the type to like savory and sweet on one plate. I prefer them separate but this place makes the exception. 

I can't talk enough about the pho dip! It's pho in a sandwich. How do you go wrong! A healthy amount of meat on the sand which and a great texture while its in your mouth! Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good! It's very interesting though for a fusion type restaurant. I got the asian falafel wrap and hubz got the chicken katsu club. He said it was amazing and I thought it was very good because I hate chicken! The wrap was okay but nothing too special. Their sauce variety was awesome as well. We also ordered the Thai clam chowder which was only ok, the Japanese curry fries with egg which was my fave, and the Thai tea that was awesome. Overall I will be back if I need a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"TOTALLY recommend this place! we drove all the way from North Las Vegas to try this place out! we started with their Dragon Fries. The spice mixture was so flavorful, and the heat has a kick! it comes with some kind of spicy ketchup which is addicting. we ordered pho dips with the house made furikake chips. awesome concept & delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time Buddhas and our bellies are definitely happy! 

I ordered the Pho Dip with the Furikaki chips... all I can say is YUM. The Pho Au Jus is delicious, without it the sandwich would not be the same. The Furikaki chips are thin and crunchy, super delicious. My fiance ordered the Chicken Katsu Cobb Salad and she loves it. She wasn't even hungry and she's chowing down!

Downside? It is pretty pricey. We will be back, but not often due to pricing."}
{"text":"Buddha Belly deli just flipped the script on sandwiches and fusion dishes ! 

Not a lot of places can earn 5 stars on my first visit. Heck it's hard for me to rate 5 stars period unless I'm super impressed. Friendly service , amazing food and housemade everything is why Buddha Belly Deli is worthy of five shiny stars. BBD is kicking off their grand opening with a bang and turning Asian delicacies into tasty fusion dishes you won't find anywhere else ! I mean pho French dip ?! Genius and amazing. 

Everything we tried was delicious down to the house made pickles ( order extra you'll be glad you did ) and the hot sauce ! Those sauces pack a punch. 

Thai clam chowder. Flavored with coconut milk and Thai chilies its a little spicy and packed with flavor. Absolutely loved this

Pho French dip - Thinly sliced sirloin on a baguette with bean sprout and jalapeño. I personally would add more cilantro and more jalapeño. Dip it in the pho au jus ! Seriously where has this been all my life ?! I'm already obsessed with pho so this is like the best thing ever ! Favorite thing I've tried in a long time. 

Charsui Pork Roll - Flavorful and juicy charsui meat with slaw. Boyfriend said it was the best sandwich he's ever had. He's hard to please to so when he can't stop saying mmmm or something whole eating his meal that's when you know this place is legit. 

Both sandwiches served with homemade chips dusted with furikake which is a seaweed seasoning. 

The icing on the cake was the complimentary pumpkin crunch we received after our amazing lunch. 

If you're looking to try something new or have this place bookmarked. Do it and do it now. You will be glad you did. I can't wait to go back and mark up my stamp card. Buy 9 entrees 10th free. What a great find ! Now if I could only find out where to get a Buddha Belly Deli tee shirt ?! Gonna rock the hell out of that baby and pass on the news of this amazing place. Or maybe I should just keep it to myself ? ;)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!! Soooo delicious!! We started with the Thai clam chowder. It had all of those Thai flavors you love with clam and bacon. My husband had the Katsu sandwich it was so crispy and flavorful. I had the shrimp po boy it had amazing flavor and crispy shrimp. I would definitely order it again! You must try this place!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love Buddha Belly Deli!! Their concept is absolutely ridiculously cool. I mean come on...pho in sandwich form, desserts with an Asian twist, and an attractive menu that makes you want to try EVERYTHING?! I've saved this review until I could try ALL of their sandwiches! Here are my rankings:

My FAVES: Pho dip, sloppy joe
GOOD to try: Shrimp po boy, chicken katsu club,
Just OK: Char siu pork, chicken salad sandwich

Don't get me wrong, all the sandwiches are delicious and well executed.  I would order any one of them again, but the flavors for the pho dip and sloppy joe really stood out for me.  The sandwiches have generous portions of meat and the bread is heavenly.  My thoughts on the char siu pork sandwich was that overall it had good flavor, but for some reason I was expecting pork belly and I really wanted pork belly. Somehow, my expectations were deflated. Womp womp :( The chicken salad sandwich was shy on that gingery flavor. I make a pretty mean chicken salad sandwich at home and I was not really feeling this one.  I love that the sandwiches come with a side of furikake chips (I loooovee furikake...who doesn't?) and house made pickles.

As far as other menu items, I have tried the Thai red curry flatbread, thai clam chowder, kitchen sink gumbo, dragon breath fries, chicken katsu curry (needs more rice), and 9th island potato salad.  From this bunch, I loved the dragon breath fries and thai clam chowder.  I feel that the thai red curry flatbread needed a boost of something.  What's great is that you can add a kick with their house made hot sauces, which are  available in 3 different spice levels.

I have not had too much luck in the dessert department. I really wanted to try the thai tea cupcakes and the 5 spice carrot cake cupcakes, but they are always out when I am there=(. The coconut butter mochi and pumpkin crunch were just OK for me. I will have to drop in for dessert sometime earlier in the day, because all the cupcakes were gone by dinner time.

I really like their Thai tea here, not to sweet and the best thing about it is that it is refillable!!!

Not only is their food delicious, but they have awesome customer service!  It feels good when they recognize you and remember your name. Mark and the rest of the guys are genuinely nice.  I always see smiles on their faces and they always make it a point to stop by your table to make sure everything tastes right. It's also a nice touch that they offer stamp cards! Thank you BBD for making your customers feel appreciated :) I cannot wait to bring in another friend and introduce them to the delicious offerings of BBD. Just make sure you save a cupcake or two for me. Pls and thank you =P

p.s. minus one star for some food items falling flat on flavor."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  The dragon's breath fries are killer.  When I say killer, they're so good.  Do not eat them if you plan on going to see customers or plan to smooch someone afterwards.  If they ate the fries with you, you're good."}
{"text":"Yelp HQ said my ONE star review update was a \"personal attack\" on the restaurant.  I challenge anyone to state this review doesn't conform to the terms of service of yelp.  These are the facts and unembellished first hand personal experience I had on a visit made December 09, 2015 during lunch, made with one other dining companion.

1.  FACT:  Service is slow, inattentive.  

1.1. Fact:  It took  15 minutes to place an order.
1.2. Fact:  It took 20 minutes to receive the order.
1.3.  Fact:  Order was incomplete.  I paid for and did not receive an order of dragon breath fries.

2.  Personal Experience:  Food - far below par

2.1. Personal Experience:  Bulgogi burrito - tasted like beef marinated in a soy, tomato sauce with wet, vinegary pickled veg so sour it overpowered everything.  The rice soaked with vinegar.  Ketchup and vinegar is not a good flavor combination.  Food score 1/5.

2.2. Personal Experience - Ginger scallion flatbread - tasted like Ginger infused mayo, red onions, processed chicken and scallions atop an unsalted  cracker crust.   A hint of melted cheese here and there.   Flavorless.  Food score 1/5.

2.3.  Personal Experience:  \"Bullet Proof Monk Coffee\" - Butter and coconut oil melted in coffee.  Tasted like melted butter.  Unpalatable.  Incredibly unhealthy.  Food score 1/5

Conclusion:  There are many other restaurants in the greater Las Vegas area that have, in my personal experience, delivered far superior service, food quality, and dining experience. From a quantitative perspective, I have not scored any restaurant in the greater Las Vegas area lower than this one."}
{"text":"Happy Food = Happy Tummies!!
This place has an amazing food with phenomenal flavor!! 

I love the creative spin that goes behind each entree. 
Everything is made fresh from scratch.
The quality of the food justifies the price so I'm not worried about that.

Customer service is outstanding and they are very friendly people. In fact, I asked one of the employees how they came up with Thai Clam Chowder and he was able to give me a interesting brief story about it which was cool.

Here are the stuff that I've eaten that I think are fabulous!! 
You have to try these dishes!!

Sloppy Joe
Chicken Katsu
Thai Clam Chowder
Dragon Breath Fries  
Char Siu Pork Roll"}

{"text":"New favoite lunch spot! I used to eat capriotti's everyday for lunch cause I'm a huge sandwich fan. Growing up in philly all we eat is sandwiches from cheesesteaks to hoagies to roast pork with Broccoli rabe. We even eat sandwiches for breakfast (scrapple egg and cheese). Since moving to vegas I've  struggled to find great food to fill the void of missing home and Wawa. I'm now adding this place to a very short list of place that server amazing sandwiches. In addition to their sandwiches the fires and flat breads are amazing as well. I will to be going back again and again. This place is a must try for philly natives or anyone who's never had a great sandwhich. The sandwhich rolls they use are fantastic, fresh, and crisp. Any one from philly will tell you a good sandwich starts with great bread. In summary this place is a game changer."}
{"text":"Great people great food.  My family lives in the area and they are always very gracious to them.  Whenever I visit I have to stop by.  I love supporting this place!"}
{"text":"I came here after a shopping trip to the nearby Kohl's for a late lunch. I was curious about this place and person behind the counter, I believe to be the owner, was kind enough to point out their popular selections. I ordered the Chicken Katsu Club with chips and a Thai Tea. I asked if there was a way to make the Thai Tea without dairy, because of my unfortunate lactose intolerance, and the owner politely made it with Almond milk for me. Everything was amazing. The sandwich was big, but it was worth it. I am definitely ready to go back."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight, and it was great. The shrimp po boy was excellent, as was the thai clam chowder. My bf enjoyed the dragon breath fries and said they were very spicy. We will definitely be back. The only thing we didn't like was the thai tea, it was not the sweet kind. But that's just a matter of taste:)"}
{"text":"Pho dip is all i can say, great flavor and the soup \"au jus\" was amazing. also had some smother fries that had my taste pallet in a frenzy."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Three words: Japanese Curry Fries. Their food is fresh and their customer service is great! It is a little pricey, but worth it fo sho"}
{"text":"Ive been seeing alot of the fellow yelpers eating here talking about the pho dip and the shrimp po boy so we decided to try them out. Mark one of the owners which was in the front at the time was very nice and knowledgeable about their food and even offered us to try the Thai clam chowder.what a very nice gesture and making us want to come back.

Thai clam chowder  (4/5) very innovative idea to mix the clam chowder concept with thai Tom Kha soup. I thought this was very delicious !! I would definitely eat this every time I come here. it wasn't too rich or overwhelmingly sweet or salty just right. a definite must try with some toasted bagettes on the side

Japanese curry fries w/egg- (3/5) this was just blah and I'm just being honest we actually finished it but it was a familiar taste and just what we expected. solid execution. it was French fries topped with curry and a little cheese and sunny side egg on top.

shrimp po boy (3.5/5) fried shrimp  with a coleslaw and spicy mayo sauce. it's a sandwich that I think would appeal to a lot of people but it's again to me something that didn't exceed our expectations..maybe it's because I love my sandwich bread super toasted. I think if they used a different type bread it would be so much better.

pho dip philly style (4/5) now this sandwich was on the board as a special and not on the main menu. probably my favorite thing i ate besides the soup it was grilled steak with slaw with bean sprouts and added a little cheese with pho soup broth on the side.and grilled jalapenos for some kick..the broth was more of a Thai style tasting broth more like boat noodles if you know what I mean. once again I love my bread super toasted or grilled like when you eat a grilled cheese. but dipping the sandwich in the soup was really good! great idea! 

sides( 3.5/5)we also had the coleslaw and furikake potato chips that they made in house definitely solid sides to a sandwich the chips I feel were definitely unique I never had something like that before the taste was familiar because I've eaten furikake  with rice but when combined with fried potato chips it was a totally different flavor that was original. As you keep eating it you get more addicted.

here's what I think about the whole experience... I think Mark makes this restaurant shine with his service and just being himself. I will definitely be back to eat here, but because it didn't knock my socks off for now you get a 4/5 star rating from me. thanks again everyone for a solid meal. see you soon"}
{"text":"hello welcome to Buddha Belly Deli. I stopped on my way after hearing how great this place was. It's small place taking the place of a East Coast Eats. (time to change marquee on street). Asian Fusion food that would satisfy but no wow factor. I got the BBQ pork sandwich to go with slaw and a drink. Not crazy about price for a simple sandwich. I did like how they put the meat in a bowl with bread on the side so bread not soggy. It tasted fine and was filling, but I expected more.

Thank you for dinning Buddha Belly Deli. I am not sure if I will return. Did not appeal to my return nature. Good for a quick bite if in area, but not wowed."}
{"text":"I came here for the nostalgia factor plus all the hype. This was my first Asian fusion experience and it still gave me the feeling like I was back in Taiwan were I lived for two years once I had a taste of their Japanese curry fries. The curry was what captivated me more than any other flavor, it has that golden consistency with that sweet flavor that would be just as good over rice as fries. In fact I think the standard fries topped with just a bit too much mozzarella distracted from the curry the real selling point. The pho dip was presented well in simple Asian cafe platter style, and it had the familiar crunch of bean sprouts and the soft kick of Asian mustard. The meat was cold and rare which I know is the style but really was my least favorite part. I found I enjoyed the au jus with everything but the steak. Overall I thought it was a fun adventure but left without finding anything truly cravable. It's worth going for nostalgia's sake though and I only experienced a small aspect of their menu. I'd recommend sticking with their curry items and I wish now I had gone with the shrimp po boy. The jury's still out but for this experience I'd rate it at a solid 3 star"}
{"text":"BBD continues to be absolutely delicious!! This trip included: Japanese Curry Fries w Egg, Fried Brussel Sprouts, Pho Dip w chips, Veggie Curry Bowl, Bulletproof Coffee, and Iced Coffee. All amazing, as usual. If you haven't been here yet you're killing your soul. Stop reading this and get in your car...NOW!!"}
{"text":"Truly an amazing fusion of flavors!  Their version of the Vietnamese sandwich is a wonderful twist on the dipped roast beef sandwich!  The crunch on their Korean chicken is just perfection.  And the Thai clam chowder would be perfect on cold winter day and night!!  Can't forget the wonderful and attentive staff that runs this delightful little hole in the wall outside the strip.  Definitely worth the trip out!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying. I got the Pho Dip and it was extremely good. Tastes exactly how pho on a sandwich should taste. Super delicious. The chips were tasty but not so fabulous that I wouldn't try the slaw next time. 

The decor isn't terribly exciting but I don't care much about that. The music they played was right up my alley. Soul and funk music. Jamiroquai and the like. 

Absolutely would return."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come out to Buddha Belly Deli for a while now.  I've seen rave reviews from several Yelpers who I know and trust with their restaurant recommendations.  

Its a little out of the way for me to come out here, and I wanted to wait until the hype had died down a bit...but it just never died down!  People continued to check in here 2-3 times a week sometimes, so when I had the opportunity to come here on Friday night, I jumped at the chance. 

Its a lot smaller than I had thought it would be, but its cozy and inviting.  I love the bamboo on each table in a \"Lucky\" beer bottle.  Awesome!
The menu is simple, and not overwhelming with different options, although everything that they have looks great. 

We ordered 2 Pho Dip sandwiches, and a cup of the Thai clam chowder. 
The guy ringing us up said that the sandwiches came with either chips or slaw, and my fella quickly said chips, since he is not a fan of mayo.  While I was walking to our seat, I saw an almost empty bowl of slaw, and it didn't look mayo based, so I asked.  Its an ASIAN slaw!  I ordered one instead of chips, and I am SO glad that I did. 

The soup arrived, and it was wonderful.  Hearty like a regular clam chowder, although a little thinner in texture, with a gentle heat...it was really good.  Not too spicy either.  

Then, the pho dip arrived...its a huge sandwich, and I'll be honest...I might have to wrestle with myself to try anything else on the menu, it is THAT good.  I love pho, and I used to eat it all the time.  I absolutely loved that every time I would dip the sandwich into the broth and take a bite, I had the aromatic flavor of a bowl of pho!  The broth was perfect, the bread was soft, but didn't get soggy...this is a real winner here.  

The chips were excellent.  They were not too greasy, and very flavorful.  I also enjoyed their home made pickles.  

The star of the evening though, was the slaw!!  The side that I almost didn't order.  A great mix of cabbage and other veggies dressed in a ginger, soy and sesame flavored mix this was not overly salty, and simply delicious.  We even ordered a second one.

Service was great, and I absolutely loved my first visit.  
Its close to where I go to cash my paychecks, so I anticipate going back to try out some of the flatbreads, and for more of that delicious slaw!

Great job to Buddha Belly Deli.  
BELIEVE the \"hype.\"  This place is amazing."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!  It's like a taste explosion!  Everything was fresh, unique, and beautifully prepared.  I had the Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy and the Japanese curry smothered fries.  The home made potato chips were phenomenal.  I even liked the pickles that came on the side.  The service was great and the cashier was extremely knowledgeable about each food item on the menu.  When I asked for a taste of something, it was given without issue.  I will definitely go back.  Only thing I didn't quite care for, is that they were a little TOO healthy with the soda choices.  I ended up getting the orange soda, as the others were too sweet.  Still doesn't bring them down a star.  The food was just too good to not give them five stars.  About $30 for two people."}
{"text":"I was just recently bemoaning the fact that I couldn't find a good, privately-owned deli in town anymore. I was out doing some shopping at Kohl's and spotted this place. Glad I gave it a try! I went twice in two or three days. Both times, the staff were all very friendly and the food was very good and well balanced. I really liked the Pho-dip sandwich. I tried the Char-siu (sp?) BBQ sandwich my second time. It was good, but I prefer the Pho-dip. 

They have some good tea and coffee options as well. Their Thai iced-tea is good and not too sweet like some places make it and I also sampled their \"Bulletproof Monk Coffee\" which was a little different and tasty as well. I really liked the dressing on their \"Asian slaw\". I did try their chips which came in a HUGE portion. I liked them ok. I'm not a huge chips or fried food guy and there were a ton of them, so I only ate about half. 

But really, nothing bad I can say about the place and I plan on making it a regular stop! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Yummy and unique!  Started with the thai clam chowder, super tasty with lots of bacon and curry flavors and had the char sui pork roll with chips.  The pork was not as tender as I expected but the slaw on the sandwich and the different sauces available helped out. Definitely try again when I'm in the area. Good size portions."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because the concept is great but everything I had was just a letdown. The Pho Dip came out cold, broth and all. Same issue with the Clam Chowder. Curry fries were ok but the Sloppy Joe was disappointing as well. Mix in the fact that the service is kind of shitty and you have a really bad meal experience. I'm not a picky eater by any means and I don't know if I could ever get myself to eat here again. There are just way too many other options to consider.  Plus their Thai Tea is water downed to nothing, it is barely drinkable."}
{"text":"Every time I check my phone, there's always a check-in on Yelp, pictures on Facebook and Instagram from Shirley B at Buddha Belly. I've been here a few times because of that but I still have not tried what I've been meaning to try: Pho Dip!  I also wanted to try the Thai tea cupcakes but they don't have them the times I went.

Sloppy Joe:
Slightly messy but not as messy as your regular Joe. Tender meat with more sophisticated flavors. Delish!  5/5

Chicken Katsu Sandwich:
Served on a Hawaiian sweet bun.  I normally skip the buns but with this sandwich, everything just worked well together. 4.5/5

Dragon Breath Fries:
OMG!!! I love fries. I love how the seasonings are spicy and mildly sweet at the same time.  There's chili and garlic - they were not kidding calling this \"DRAGON BREATH\" fries. Even my burps after...whooo! Sooooo gooood!!!  5/5

Thai Tea:
Most Asian restaurants serve a very sweet version of this drink so, I tend to water it down. Their version is just right. 5/5

My boyfriend lost his Asian card many moons ago so, feeding him Asian food is rather difficult. However, he absolutely loved this place that he was fine if we ate here everyday. It's Asian fusion but with a mild twist - they're not trying to reinvent anything which is good.

If you spot those Thai tea cupcakes, let me know!"}
{"text":"My favorite dishes are the Mochiko chicken sandwich and the pho dip sandwich... So many good flavors and I especially love the Asian Slaw. Great customer service too!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Banh Mi sandwiches and fiery hot sauce. Good vegetarian options. The fries are really good as well."}
{"text":"If there were more stars to give I totally would!! I've heard about BBD from a co-worker like daily and the reviews were raving so I had to see what all this was about! 

 The staff alone was enough to get a 5-star rating outta me. They were so super friendly and prepared to do anything to make sure a happy customer walked out of their doors. I was immediately greeted when I came in, I believe his name was Don(extremely nice guy), and he told me about which sandwiches had already seemed to be the signature sandwiches. I went with the Pho Dip Sandwich with the House Chips and a Thai Iced Tea. There were also 3 slices of the Kimchee Pickles and let me tell you I could have bought a jar of those to eat alone! There was nothing lacking in the flavor department whatsoever, everything just married so well together there was nothing you couldn't love. I told them I had heard good things abouty BBD and was DEFINITELY going to keep it going! As a thank you they brought me a complimentary green tea iced brownie that was just as yummy as everything else.

I definitely plan to become a regular and utilize my punch card and many others in the future! You would be CRAZY to come here and leave anything on your plate. I don't know about yours but they've got one happy belly here!"}
{"text":"BUDDHA BELLAY DELLAY! Now say it over and over again as fast as you can! I don't know how many times I've repeated that phrase over and over again. I laugh while my friend wanted to strangle me to death. (: YOU SHOULD TRY IT. It's fun!

Now back to the important stuffs. The name is amazing and the reviews are equally as powerful therefore, I needed to try it. I'll admit that the pictures didn't really appeal to me and the pictures also don't do much justice.

I guess I wasn't really expecting much despite the good reviews. When I read the menu and read each description...nothing awfully jumps out at me. So in the end, I just decided to go with the char sui pork roll, which was marinated pork shoulder with pickled veggies and hoisin sauce on a sweet roll. We also got their dragon breath fries as well. 

I like spicy things so my friend requested for them to make the fries spicy... and what did the awesome workers at BUDDHA BELLAY DELLAY suggested? To use their house made ghost chili sauce with the fries. And guess what?! WE GOT OURSELVES A DEAL. And they were good! They weren't as spicy as I thought they would be but they actually gave us more sauce to put on it if we wanted it even spicier. Eesh .. that sauce is GOOD. I really do enjoy the taste of ghost chili. 

Now, the sandwich. OH THE SANDWICH. One bite and I fell in loooooooooooooove. I was not expecting their marinated pork to be so good. It was thinly sliced but it was soft and tender. To be honest, I was expecting the usual American styled char sui ... hard, dry, and ... so on and so forth. Noooooope, theirs is nothing like that. However, as you're eating it, it will get messy. 

Now I definitely want to try their other sandwiches and see what other surprises they can give me. 

The service was fantastic as well. They would sometimes come check up on us and even offered us a different type of spicy sauce, which was also very good. It went good with the sandwich too! But honestly, the sandwich itself was good enough. Char sui does  not need no spicy sauce!!!

I think the only thing I didn't really care for were their house made chips. I'm a chip fiend. I LOVE potato chips and I could just munch on Lays FOREVER. But theirs? It just didn't ... appeal to me at all. The flavor wasn't exactly there ...

I WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Updated post:
Returned 5 days later with more family and pickier eaters.  Everyone loved lunch and will return again. 

Original post:
From an east coast family who lives for Asian inspired foods, we cannot tell you how much we loved this place.  

We shared the Kitchen Sink Gumbo and loved it.  It was a combination of Portuguese sausage, spam, oxtail, and chicken.  A must have if you visit here.  

We also ordered the Pho Dip and bibimbap burrito.  Both equally delicious.  Most dishes come with their homemade chips with blended spices that you will want to eat all day long.  

Owner is super friendly and seems to really want to produce food that you cannot find elsewhere.  He has done an amazing job with the menu.  

Do yourself a favor, your belly needs to visit Buddha Belly Deli."}
{"text":"The Po-boy was really tasty with a small kick to it. Sloppy Joe fries little sweet and very tasty. Also had sweet Thai tea that was awesome. 

Great friendly service and definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  This is one of the best sandwich places I have ever had in Vegas.

I didn't think that all the hype that was on Yelp could be that true.  THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY.

Don't pass it up, the owners are the nicest people ever and you can't pass up a great sandwich place.

Anybody who ever comes to Las Vegas this will be the first place that I will bring them to!"}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype is about. Had the Pho dip sandwich. Very average maybe somewhat below. I would not recommend this place. The staff was friendly that was about it."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by during lunch since a few of my friends mentioned the restaurant before. Many said that the Pho Dip is a must try, so I tried it!  The sandwich was good and for lack of a better word \"meaty\".  The chips were too salty for my taste and almost a bit stale, I passed on those. 

As for the dip, by itself it was very bland. I felt it needed a bit of seasoning.  I added one of the spicy sauces next to the drink station and that seemed to have kicked up the dip just enough.  

As for the service it was very friendly and fast. Probably because they just opened and there were only two of us there.  Not sure if I'd go again. Perhaps if I'm driving by, but wouldn't make it a special trip to go there."}
{"text":"So far, I have been here twice, and the food and the service is excellent. I have had the short rib sloppy joe, the shrimp po boy, the Dragon's Breath fries, and the clam chowder. I could eat their homemade chips with their yo mama's sauce by the bucket full, they are so good. And their homemade pickles are awesome as well. this place is owned by 4 young cats in their late twenties who do an amazing job. So many times we see restaurant on Yelp that get four and five stars, but they end up going out of business. Please do not let this happen to this place. Tell all of your friends to come here, they will not be .disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times food was awesome and the service was great!  I recommend the gumbo, curry fries, & clam chowder.  Those were the best out of what we've tried so far.  We also had the Pho Dip & Pork sandwich (char siu style), which were both good also.  They have a small sauce bar and the green pesto sauce is BOMB!  I took home like 3 small containers of it!!

Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The Chicken Katsu was moist inside and crispy outside. And the Sloppy Joe Fries were excellent. They fuse together many different styles of foods, and they do it so well. Service was incredible, too. We're from L.A., and we hit it up whenever we come to Vegas. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is super fresh and made to order. We have tried everything on the menu and have loved it all! The service is just as incredible as the food!"}
{"text":"Found a new amazing deli! Just to my liking...Asian inspired cooked meals with a weird twist! Everything is made in house with sooo much flavor! I recommend the po boy sandwich and the dragon fries...yum yum."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and haven't been disappointed. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food....fresh and flavorful. It's a great twist on an American sandwich joint but with Asian spices and flavor.  My favs are the Thai Clam Chowder and the Szechwan Po Boy."}
{"text":"Their Buddha wrap pretty much redefined the term of \"wrap\" for me. It rocked my world so hard, I felt my mouth delicately bite through another dimension of textures and flavors."}
{"text":"Came here because of all of the great reviews.  Food was great.  Had the Pho Dip.  Yummy.  Char siu will be the next target.  Don't forget to try the homemade sauces by the soda machine.  New spot to hit when in LV.  Also, the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Furikake = crack! If you have no idea what furikake is, it is a seaweed blend seasoning that you can sprinkle on anything and make it about 10x tastier.  The house made potato chips with furikake are extremely addicting, they will have you coming back for more!  These chips are no joke the bomb diggity! Overseas they have these lays potato chips called kushu seaweed flavor, we get them imported from our Guam relatives...that's how serious we are about chips!  These chips here taste almost exactly like the chips we import except they are crispier and crunchier!   

Okay enough about chips, on to the sandwiches.  We tried two of their sandwiches.  The pho dip while tasty was not as good as the katsu club.  The pho sandwich had thinly sliced top sirloin with cilantro, pickled bean sprouts, and jalapeños. I substituted the Chinese mustard for mayo instead, since mustard is too overwhelming for me.  The baguette was good but I wish the whole sandwich or at least the bread came slightly toasted/warm like the traditional French dip.  The meat or the pho au jus really needs just a little more flavor to make this sandwich complete.  Perhaps a hoisin/sriracha blend to add a little saltiness instead of the mustard? Or a heartier beef flavor in the au jus? However, creative concept and has potential if it was a little more refined.  On to the shining star of the meal, the katsu club was AMAZING! It was two pieces of fried katsu chicken with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, and smothered in hoisin sauce.  The only thing that could probably bring this over the top would be the addition of a fried egg.  But this sandwich was packed with flavor.  I'm pretty much counting down the days until my next visit, when we order this again.  And who can forget the chips....yum...I was tempted to order a some to go. We also got the mango Arnold Palmer, which has a good strong mango flavor.  And it came with a free refill!  The staff was nice and the service was fairly quick.  Will be back again, especially since they are open on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Love the food, the crew and location.  For the best lunch or dinner it's a must go. The chowder is amazing, the pho dip is a must have and homemade cupcakes finish the meal nicely."}
{"text":"I was randomly in this area the other day, yelped this place and it got good ratings so we feuded to try it out. If you like Asian fusion type places this is a great place. They have a lot of variety with Asian twists on everything.

We walked in and it was not busy at all!
I got their falafel wrap and it was really good. It came in a spinach wrap with spicy cucumber salad and potatoes inside. It was a nice size portion and also came with homemade potato chips. I also tried the short rib flatbread which was also really good.

Their homemade lemonade was a good choice as well as their homemade Thai tea. Their cupcakes looked awesome but I was so full I didn't try one. They have a nice selection of dessert cakes cookies and cupcakes with different and unique flavors to try. 

Overall i thought this place was cool try to but so far out of the way. If I lived closer I would probably be a regular though."}
{"text":"Finally made it over here after so many positive reviews.  This was the former location of East Coast Eats and for the most part, the layout hasn't changed although all the sports memorabilia is gone.  In fact, the decor is extremely boring and I strongly hope they will take some care and make this place more inviting because the food is really worth it.  At least get some TV's so we can watch the game :) 

I was a bit disappointed at first as there seemed to be a big take out order and the cashier had to leave me standing there for about 5 minutes while he spoke on the phone and packaged the food.  It seems one of the other people could have helped. 

Their menu is very clear on the electronic displays but their drink menu only mentions the thai coffee and tea and if I hadn't seen the refrigerator behind the counter I wouldn't have known I could get a soda or a water.

Luckily, once the cashier got to me, the experience changed for the better.  I went with the Gumbo and the Shrimp Po Boy.  The Gumbo was very good, especially when the hot sauce was mixed in.  It was chock full of sausage, oxtail, rice, and many other flavors.    The Po Boy was excellent with fresh, well cooked shrimp.  They were about 40-51 count size and had excellent flavor. The roll was a solid sandwich roll.   The homemade Thai chips are excellent.

I can see why some yelpers seem to be making this place their home.

I look forward to seeing what they do to the place and will return soon to try the other menu items which include flatbreads."}
{"text":"BBD!
     I've been to this place a few times now, mostly with the Duchess Shirley B.  I truly believe that it's her patronage which helped put this place on Yelpers' radar.  The food is good and it deserves the props, but I think Tita Shirley deserves a little bit of credit, too.  It's thanks to her first review that I even knew about the tasty Thai Clam Chowder with a bit of a kick to it.  Thanks to her, I'm a huge fan of BBD's house made chips with the furikake seasoning; they're like crack.  And thanks to her, I know where I can get pumpkin crunch when the craving hits (when it's available because that stuff sells out quickly due to its scrumptiousness).
   The group of owners here are a great bunch of guys who make sure that you're happy with your food and one (or two) always stop by the table to check on us.  It's great to see a new business like this one take off so quickly.  Just remember who loves you the most, BBD--Shirley has 22 check-ins and counting since you opened in mid-October.  If that's not love, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"I'm not much of an Asian foodie but came to check out this new little place. Since pizza is not very Asian I went for that and I must say I was pleasantly surprised as it was so tasty and delightful!  And a girl gotta have her desert so I chose the 5 Spice Carrot cake...OMG it was amazing!! The staff was the best part so helpful and a joy to be around, really enjoyed my time at BBD!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out after warring with myself for 6 months...

So I bought a 9th island pizza, the pho dip sandwich, and a Szechwan shrimp po boy. The pizza was awesome! And the good thing is that two people can share it for $10. The pho dip sandwich was not my cup of tea - and I love pho. The roast beef was pretty rare and just didn't fit my idea of \"good sandwich\" material. The flavor was pretty bland.

The Szechwan shrimp po boy stole the show! It was spicy and the bread was soft... The overall flavor was amazing. You also get homemade chips (yes chips - the round potato kind - not French fries) with your sandwich order. 

For $40 though, the price can be a little steep, but the flavor made me forget all about how much I spent, so it evens out. Lol."}
{"text":"If you don't know, now you know. You cannot beat the quality of food nor its prices. We had a party of 4 and ordered I swear almost half the menu, because everything looked so good. The brussel sprouts were to die for. Yep, brussel sprouts. And the sloppy joe fries were on hit!  I don't visit Vegas often but I'm going to make it a point to come back to this spot every time I return."}
{"text":"BBD has been on my list of new places to try for quite awhile.  Even though it isn't far from my house, I always seem to forget about them! :(

Some coworkers and I were going to see a movie after work, and since the movie started a few hours later, we decided to meet at BBD for a quick bite. This week BBD is participating in the \"Yelp Shares the Love\" promotion, donating the proceeds from dessert sales to Three Square, so we had even better reason to visit.

First of all, it's easy to find and there is plenty of parking. I used to go to the nail salon in the same center - boy do I wish that BBD would have been there back then!

It's casual, but nice.  You order at the counter and seat yourself. When your food is ready, they bring it to you.

The cashier was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the Pho Dip for myself and the Dragon Fries to share with the group. 

It didn't take long for the food to come out. Now, I was quite excited to try the Pho Dip, since I've heard such great things about it.  It's a wonderfully creative sandwich - and I like both Pho and French dips (separately), but I hate to say that the combo of the 2 did not really blow me away.  It's nothing against BBD, just personal taste.  The bread was good and was able to stand up to dipping, which is always important.  The beef was also tasty. Unfortunately, the addition of the pickled bean sprouts, cilantro and basil just made the sandwich too sweet for me (if that even makes sense). I was missing a \"kick\" of some kind to off-set the sweetness.

The dragon fries were freaking amazing! They are basically garlic fries with Thai chili - although I didn't find them too spicy.  They come with kimchi ketchup on the side. Funny thing - I don't like ketchup and I don't like kimchi, but together they were freaking fantastic! Please order these fries if you go, you won't regret it (unless you are a wimp and can't take the heat)!

My friend ordered the Thai Clam Chowder and Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy. Both were really delicious (I tasted both, of course!).  However, she is a pescatarian and was surprised to find bacon in the soup. It's our fault, since the item is not marked as vegetarian on the menu (or meatless), but we were surprised this wasn't mentioned on the menu at all.  So, beware if you don't eat pork!  The po-boy was really good. The shrimp was crispy and really tasty. I would definitely order this item.

We also each ordered a dessert. They had a selection of cupcakes to choose from. I went with the lemon cupcake, with lemon frosting. 2 others went with the green tea cupcake.  Although the frosting was really good, the cupcake itself was quite dry. However, it was for charity, and I wouldn't normally order dessert, so I am certainly not complaining!!

Overall, it was a great dinner. It's an interesting concept and they are wildly creative! It's a local, family owned business, and that alone deserves support! I definitely suggest stopping in for a quick bite if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Tried BBD today after seeing a great review in the paper.  Everything we tried was delicious!  Short Rub Red Curry Flatbread was out of this world good! The homemade chips are amazing.  Prices are a little steep and there's no fountain drinks so you pay more for bottles and cans.  Service is on the slow side.  Despite counter service the tables are bussed for you.  Would like to go back and try other tasty food!"}
{"text":"oh my gosh words could not explain how delicious the flavors of each dishes were. It was our first time here and we ordered their famous PHO DIP, dragon breath fries and their asian bbq flatbread. Each dish was just bursting with flavors. Like their Dragon breath fries, it tasted like garlic fries with a twist of spiciness to it. while their pho dip was really tasty especially when you dip your sub to the pho. the Pho itself gave life to the sub. Lastly their asian bbq flatbread was topped with chinese sausages, cilantro, jalapeno and cheese. It is not your ordinary flatbread, with all the toppings it just give your mouth the best flatbread craving satisfaction. i highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 12-13-15 at 6pm. Sat in the car for a few minutes confused because the writing on the door says they close at 5 but the lights were on and there were people inside ordering. A quick trip inside to ask their hours revealed they are open til 9 tonight but the hours are changing next week. Weird but understandable.  I have been wanting to try this place since I sampled their chowder at the redline rendezvous yelp event. 
$35.03 got us a pho dip, fried brussel sprouts, korean chicken wings, two small fountain drinks,  a thai chowder,  and some potato salad. 
I watched the runner take my chowder to another table and after they denied ordering it he took it back to the window and it sat there for a few minutes before he finally brought it over.  I suppose he didn't think I noticed.  It was just as good as I remembered though. Kinda reminds me of tom yum soup with potatoes, clams, and swine. It really hit the spot on this cold night. 
Sweet and sour korean chicken wings were promising at first because they had a crispy outside and very good flavor but were full of raw yellow fat which I can't stand at all. I really did like the outside which was sticky and sweet but spicy and wonderful. 
Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly but were drenched in some kind of odd seasoning that ruined it. If they would just cut the amount of seasoning in half they would be good. 
Pastry  case was completely empty...not sure if you have to get there early to have the privilege of eating them or not. 
Bathroom could use a cleaning. There was a ball of hair stuck to the toilet and black marks all over the bottom of it. The sink had calcium and lime buildup on the base of the faucet which made it look dirty.  
Husband liked the pho dip. I like the paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. I also liked the fountain jones soda. It is definitely worth a trip but I do not want to eat there again. It was good but not crave-worthy if that makes sense."}
{"text":"So far so good! On my second visit so far. It's very close to where I was visiting so why not. 

The first time I got the pho dip $9. It comes with a soup that you dip it in. Would have liked to try this in house but I took it to go so meh. It was better than anticipated. The winner went to the chips that it came with, though. Really liked the seasoning on this :0D!

I also ordered Japanese curry fries $6 but I didn't really care for these. Didn't like the curry on it at all. 

Thai iced tea. Typical. $3.50

Second visit. For my drink I got the tropical green tea $2.50. Nothing special but not sure if I like the taste of it. Leaves a meh taste on my tongue. 

Thai clam chowder $3.50. Ooh, surprisingly I liked this. It's got a bit of spice to it which was a nice kick (I can't handle spicy very well so this was a \"kick\" to me). Nice overall appetizer. 

Char siu pork roll $8. Big sandwich!! I couldn't finish it all. But I didn't really care for this sandwich overall. I think it's just cause of me not liking char siu overall but the taste didn't sit well with me."}
{"text":"I came by during my lunch hour and got a starter and a side. I ordered the dragon breath fries and kitchen sink gumbo. My total came to about $9 for them both . Everything was yummy, especially that gumbo! my tip would be to call ahead because it did take some time go get the food. The fries were not what I expected. I thought they'd have more of a garlic taste but they had this interesting heat with this yummy asian style ketchup. Gumbo was my favorite with the spam, chicken, and oxtail. OMG. The gumbo and rice alone filled me up."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite with a friend before heading to the airport. Got the shrimp po boy and the pho dip. Both were really really good. Their house made hot sauces are also good. Ask for the ghost pepper one if you dare! Tried a sip of my friends Vietnamese coffee. A bit less strong than most, but still delicious. Staff was super friendly too."}
{"text":"I kept reading all these great reviews, so that made this a go to spot to try. I went for lunch on Thursday about 11:45am. The place is clean and simple, with about 10 tables. There were 3 tables taken, and the stream of customers was steady throughout my meal, although it was never packed. 

I ordered the Char Sui pork sandwich. Served on a sweet bread, with chips, and a thai ice tea. Wow was this sandwich delicious. A mouthful of flavor in every bite. I didn't add any sauces because I'm not a spicy eater. One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, for $8. 

Staff was friendly, met the owner Don who was running the cash register. 

A nice touch is having a water station available, with cucumbers infused. 

I would give it 4.5 stars, they lost a bit because the thai ice tea (3.50) wasn't all that good and I love thai ice tea. They did offer a free refill which is a nice touch.

I'll definitely be back to try more sandwiches, and will highly recommend to my friends and anyone else. 

Its located near the Kohl's shopping center right off the 215 at Valle Verde."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out since last year, but since I'm never really in Henderson (or in the area of this place) I never found the time until recently.

Now the concept of this place is pretty cool - Asian inspired food. However, I wasn't as impressed as some other Yelpers.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu Club and my boyfriend ordered the Curry Katsu Plate. My sandwich was good, but nothing \"amaze-balls\" or memorable. It came with chips, which I can never complain about. My boyfriend found his kimchi to be on the soggy side. He said it felt like they just had the cabbage soaking, it might be a personal preference for him to have it crunchy tho. I do have to say I was a BIG fan of the Japanese Curry fries. As I stated earlier, I love chips which are mainly made from potatoes so in the transitive property - I LOVE fries. It reminded me of the Garbage Fries at Park which I'M ABSOLUTELY A FAN OF.

I might have to do an updated review when I come back and try something else on the menu. I might have played it too safe with something I was way too familiar with. I'm thinking of trying their pho sandwich when I give this place another go. However, as of right now... It's a solid 3 stars only because I wouldn't find myself going out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"The Char Sui is amazing. The Korean BBQ Chicken Wings are extra tasty but the heat builds up fast, pace yourself. The Japanese Curry Fries are a must. Go here now."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pho Dip Steak sandwich I know. Parking right in front. Will be a regular. Real, real clean is a plus for me."}
{"text":"The food here is the all time best! Such a convenient spot in Vegas and a unique taste from other restaurants. My boyfriend and I had came in and we got the best service and food came out immediately... I have a certain way of eating and with all of my complicating questions and concerns Jasmine, who took our order, was so helpful and friendly. She knew every ingredient and was so patient with me and truly went above and beyond with our food. Good service is hard to find now a days and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Overall: Great food ! 
Although not understanding why I call ahead and for pick up but still have to wait another 10 minutes for order once I arrive. To add to that, part of my order was the Pho Dip sandwhich.. Which Would have been perfect but not when you forget the actual Pho soup? So I have a rare steak sandwich with nothing to 'cook' the meat making this meal to me nearly inedible. I realize I order near closing time but coming from a person who as operated multiple restaurants.. This is absolutely unacceptable. If this is a main thing people order there how can you forget it? If you want customers to come back especially first time customers, make sure your workers double check their stuff ESPECIALLY closing time when their antsy and wanna go home."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some friends who live in the area. Even though it was a drive from the MGM Grand, it was well worth it. Great food, good prices and excellent service. We ordered family style so we can try a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed. We all agreed that they had the best buffalo wings ever. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Vegas just so I can stop by again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! We had the pho dip, bibimbop burrito, Brussels sprouts, and clam chowder and ALL were wonderful! The service was great as well! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Buddha Belly Deli is a great meal for any local in Henderson. The food is delicious and the staff are very polite. The restaurant itself is pretty nice and clean which is a plus. I got the Chicken Katsu Club and it was an incredibly tasty meal. The nice thing about this place is that they are definitely not holding back with portions. The sandwich was huge! 

The only problem with this place was the amount of time it took to get our food. I came with a decent sized group and three of our guys got their food way before everyone else did. When they we're almost done, two other guys then got their food. When those two guys were done, I finally got my food. It was very inconsistent and took way too much time."}
{"text":"First time here! Katsu Cobb Salad and Pho Dip! Excellent. Great flavors, cool decor, friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time customer. I stopped by on my way home from a long day at work looking for easy take out. Greeted at the counter by a friendly employee (I think his name was Ridge) who welcomed me and was genuinely interested to hear that I was a first time customer. First impressions are important to me and so is customer service that is warm and friendly. The kid was real and authentic. Both are valued to me. I'm the customer. I have the credit card. I want to feel special. He gets it. 

The Thai Clam Chowder is excellent with big generous chunks of clams and just the very right amount of spicy bite on my tongue with every spoonful. At $3.50 a bowl its a must try that comes with oven toasted bread. I will definitely go back just for more chowder. 

I also had the special for $12.00 which was a well prepared and nicely presented rice and chicken creation with Korean spices.

I finished up with a green tea cupcake that was moist and not overly sweet. A few other kinds of cupcakes under glass on the counter were also very inviting... 

I will definitely eat here again and am ready to explore more of their unique menu.

I'm in."}
{"text":"I first stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered the much loved pho dip and house made furikake chips.I really like how BBD is decorated inside with the dark wood floors, dark tables and asian decorations. The service was fine, I was greeted as I walked in and had a short wait for my sandwich. I know I am in the minority but I thought the pho dip was just ok. The roast beef was good but I just didn't think it was anything extraordinary. The chips were ok also, a little greasy though. 

I usually like to give a business a second chance if I didn't enjoy my first visit, which I did for BBD.I went back today and tried the chicken katsu club, again with the housemade furikake chips. Maybe my expecations were just too high from all the other reviews but again it was just ok. The chicken was overcooked and slightly dry and the panko had little flavor. The chips this time tasted a little too fishy for my taste. 

I also think it is priced a little too high. Sandwiches are $8-9 and flatbreads are $10-12. I am glad so many others like it here and wish them the best of luck. Unfortunately it just didn't do it for me :("}
{"text":"the food and the service was great. it is highly recommended. on the other hand yelp is not recommended. they only count the good yelps.if you dont include pictures and yelp hundreds of times you are not considered much. so yelp needs to improve their rating systems or someone needs to come up with a better system.no stars for yelp they suck"}
{"text":"You know how people get excited for a new ride at an amusement park, then it turns out not as fun as expected?? Well I get excited for new restaurants and this one just didn't do it for me. 
Now, normally I would've never gone here due to the distance, but this place was frequented by yelpers and it also happened to be about 2 miles from my friends house, so I decided to make the trek. 
I walked in eyes wide open, and immediately settled on the pho dip because anyone who's ever gone to pho with me knows I always get banh Minh to dip in my soup, so it seemed like a marriage made in heaven. However the sandwich and the soup have to be delicious of this to work. The sandwich was decent, but the pho dip was severely lacking.
Second time around. I opted for the shrimp po boy. It's was passable, but wasn't spiced very well, not particularly memorable. It's not something I'd order again, but if we're hangin out id take a bite out of yours. 
The two redeeming qualities I liked were the potato chips and the gumbo. Those were defcon 7 deliciousness especially when you used the chips to scoop out the gumbo. Definitely recommend it. 
Didn't love it, didn't hate it. But I will make at least one more trip to try out the clam chowder that seems to get a lot of love."}
{"text":"i brought my employees to eat here, to be honest didnt know what kind of food they have, i just love the name.. chill atmosphmere, met all 3 owners they are awesome too.. we ordered japanese curry fries, shrimp po boy, pho dip, and the sloppy joe!!! 

the food was seasoned great then the owner brought us ginger cupcakes, we destroyed them and didnt bring them back for my employees!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this new place. And it was worth the drive since we live across town. Service was A+, staff was all smiles and super friendly. But they were out shined by the food which was off the hook. Great prices too. Will def visit again."}
{"text":"Ok I have taken my time to write this review because, at first I was hooked on the kitchen sink gumbo, the best fusion gumbo I have ever had after about 5-6 time I ventured away from it and tried the char siu pork roll sandwich I was ready to do my review but wait forgot I also got the spam \" 9th island potato salad \" I love spam.

But you know the old saying save the best for last so today I got the \"pho dip\" and let me tell you the best dip I have ever had.

So let me talk about the vibe here it's so hip, come take a look. 

It's in the Kohl's shopping center in the same building as The Mirror Mirror Salon and my dry cleaners. 215 and Valle verde"}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit and I feel like there was more to try at this place. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the pho dip and char sui pork sandwich. Everything was reasonably priced. The pho dip was definitely something different.  The pho broth was amazing! I think that having a whole bowl of actual pho would have been great! The pho dip was pretty good. The sandwich itself was cold and the dip was hot. Dipping the sandwich made it like warm, but by the time you got to the other half, the pho was cold! I was a bit sad about this. I like my pho hot. Maybe I should've asked them to heat it up. The char sui pork sandwich was super flavorful!  I think this one beats the pho dip. The homemade chips were yummy!  I'm kinda biased because I love furikake.  The slaw was a bit bitter but the seasoning on it was pretty good.  

After my meal I decided to try one of their cupcakes and green tea cookies.  They were both delicious!  The cookie was soft and the center tasted the best because all the matcha settled in the middle.  The frosting on the cupcake was extremely generous!  I had a fun time eating all of it.  

I'll definitely try this place again for an updated review.  

fyi the owner was so kind!"}
{"text":"Nice new spot at 215 and Valle Verde. 

My fella and I came by while we were in the area and had at first thought about taking our food to go, then changed our minds last minute. We decided to share the pho dip, shrimp po boy, dragon breath fries and the shortrib fries. 

The pho dip was ok, I enjoyed the pho au jus, but it didn't have the flavors I was hoping for. A little on the bland side. The bread was way too dense for me. I had the same the issues with the shrimp po boy. The breading on the shrimp was a tad too thick and the bread was again not for me. My favorite two items we tried were the both the dragon breath and shortrib fries. The dragon breath fries had a nice kick. I highly recommend bringing gum or mints if you decide to order this...The shortrib had decent flavor and I would order this again of the four things we tried.

All the food was ok, but I didn't feel the need to finish our food and the leftovers sat in our fridge for a few days untouched before I tossed them in the trash. Most of the items just need more flavor.

The service was extremely attentive and i look forward to giving them another try and hopefully finding some other menu items that suit my tastes a little better."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with the green tea white chocolate cupcake. The pho dip sandwich was interesting. I can't really say anything bad about this place. Prices are very reasonable. Had I lived closer, I'd frequent."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in! Food is delicious and the people are awesome! Great music adds to a casual atmosphere. We will be back!

We tried the house made chips, the Thai clam chowder, BiBimBop burrito, and Pho Dip. Recommend ALL of it!"}
{"text":"I found myself in Las Vegas not eating at a giant hotel buffet...which was sad, but made slightly better when I found this highly rated casual restaurant near my hotel. Asian fusion has always been kind of an awkward black sheep in my world of dining options in that I rarely crave it because why not just get real Asian food when you're craving Asian food? but I decided to give it a try anyway.

The main entrees were sandwiches, flatbreads, or salads ranging from $9-12 ish in price and came with a side of cole slaw or chips (I think). I ordered what my cashier recommended, the \"Pho Dip\" sandwich, and was pleasantly surprised at what I received. The Pho Dip came with cold rare-ish steak slices, cilantro, bean sprouts, basil, and onion on a soft baguette bun with a pho broth dipping sauce. Overall, I enjoyed the concept and execution of this dish and the broth was a really tasty soup to drink after I was finished with my sandwich. It was a large sandwich and I was quite stuffed after eating it. The coleslaw it came with was tasty but too healthy for me...the lack of mayo really made it more like eating a bunch of lightly seasoned shredded cabbage than an actual cole slaw.

I'd be back if I were ever in the area and not eating a giant hotel buffet!"}
{"text":"The reviews giving this place almost a perfect score are legit. As posted in my check in, the seven of us ordered half the menu items and everything was great. Can't wait to return and try the other half."}
