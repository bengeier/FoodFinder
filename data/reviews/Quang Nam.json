{"text":"THE BEST Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Truly a hidden gem!!  Pho us the best...all veggies are fresh and crispy...each dish has a unique and different taste.  A MUST TRY...trust me!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good!!! I've never had authentic Pho but if it doesn't taste like it does at this place I don't want it! The service is good. The chef/owner is awesome! The food always comes out in a simple yet delicious presentation. I've only had Pho, spring rolls, egg rolls, and house rice with fried chicken. I good choice for some one that is not into soups!!"}
{"text":"There are a few times in life when you get the urge to try something different,  well last night was one of those nights. Quang Nam Vietnamese Restaurant changed the way I thought of vietnamese cuisine, I don't remember the name of my plate (but I've included a picture) my meal was so perfectly created, it was an exquisite plate the chicken was excellently prepared and juicy and full of flavor my husband ordered Shrimp Pho and it was Delicious, everything was so FRESH the fresh sprouts, mint, cilantro, limes & jalape√±os  ooh Wow!!  you gotta try this place, this place deserves to be situated in Scottsdale, because the building itself is not the best, but you know what they say about those insignificant little restaurants,  this is the place to be if you're on this side of town, try it you will LOVE this place!

{"text":"When this place was first opened, Ph and rice dishes were good. Now, the quality of the dishes have gone down,  we won't be back."}
{"text":"I work on 43rd ave and little did I know I worked behind this Vietnamese restaurant. I've been at my job for a while now and I never knew this place was here ! I also work at a Vietnamese restaurant, so I got excited to find this place and decided to try it out (I Love Vietnamese Food). Anyways, it was so good, inexpensive & they have Thai tea !!!! (My favorite). Great friendly staff, clean restaurant, fast service. I definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"A good pho restaurant to go to when others are closed. Service was good even though it was just one man and his wife, they had excellent customer service. Food was brought out in a short amount of time and not only is their pho delicious their dishes as well. The only thing I didn't like was when we ordered the same  entree it didn't come with rice as it did the first time. That was disappointing but all over great experience nice owners."}
{"text":"Customer service is everything.  Noticed this restaurant nearby.  Looked into it.  Wanted to try Pho.  Upon walking into the place, I was greeted by a very friendly man.  I was nervous.  Never tried this food before.  He was kind and walked me through the processes.  I finally just consented to eating at the restaurant (which, BTW, is very nice and very clean).  The gentleman walked me through the steps to putting the pho together, what to add if I wanted it, etc.  His attention was not overbearing at all.  It was friendly and I appreciated the mans help.  When I was unable to finish all the pho, he brought me a go to package and set it up himself.  I will return to, and recommend,  quang nam due to the outstanding customer service and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Really awesome pho. Pho is about the broth. This is well balanced. Great flavor. The chicken and rice meal is very good, is very filling and priced correctly."}
{"text":"I've only had pho a couple of times I love it! I usually go to another location wich is delicious too but customer service sucks they are really Rude nd don't care but I still go because obviously it's delicious. That location was closed today and I came here. BEST DECISION ever!! Delicious pho and the lady and gentleman were so nice at some point the lady came and recommended one of the sauces to dip out beef in. Like I said I've only had it a couple of times and I'm still learning my ways with sauces and stuff. The gentleman asked how it was everything was perfect. Also on yelp closing hours was 9pm and when we got there it said 8:30. We got there @ 8:20 and they were so welcoming even tough they closed in 10 min they let us sit there and enjoy our meal. They made my night  and I'm absolutely coming here now."}
{"text":"We eat Vietnamese often and this place is just okay. The portions are large but with less meat than other restaurants, and the quality wasn't great. The place is clean, the service is acceptable, and the atmosphere is nice, with a good selection on the menu. An average meal, but  there are better places in the area."}
