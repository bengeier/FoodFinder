{"text":"Ça fait deux fois que je viens à Montréal et deux fois que je vais à fisshu! Je me régale! Ces les japonais en illimité, c'est pour moi ! Je n'ai jamais été déçu! Le terryaki de saumon, le sushi fraise ou banane, l'il du dragon et bien sûr tout le reste étaient très bon ! Si je retourne à Montréal, j'y retourne !"}
{"text":"Fairly average all-you-can-eat sushi place. Nothing standout in the food. The service is slow, and half the time they forgot to bring things we'd ordered, or got our orders confused with those from other tables. We tried ordering a second round, and after a half hour, they hadn't brought it. We gave up and just got some dessert instead. They don't even offer green tea. Really not great."}
{"text":"Service laisse à desiré également les sushi sont mauvais  C'est les sushis les plus mauvais que j'ai mangé a date"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was extremely terrible. The waiter would look at us from afar but would never come to our table to serve us water, take away our plates and also ask us if everything was okay. He also made us wait 40 minutes before we were able to pay. We had to ask one of his coworkers to serve us water. At first I thought this restaurant was worth a 5 star, the food would come in fast, service was great. But once we got comfortable, we were ignored."}
{"text":"It's a new restaurant and I tried the other day,which kinda disappointed me. The service wasn't that good and some Chinese people gathering around smoking look like gangsters, which also bothers me a little bit. Last but not least, the food tastes okay i guess but just like all other sushi bars in Montreal, nothing special can leave u with the impression that u might wanna go again next time. In a nutshell, with the expensive price I would not recommend my friends to go there at least. For the price, the food there really doesn't worth going, period."}
{"text":"Service is commendable. But food is disappointing. Menu does not stand out from the panoply of all you can eat sushi restaurants, and all flavours are overpowered by the sweetness. Even the sushi rice is sweet (no trace of vinegar discerned)."}
{"text":"Nous n'avons pas reçu plusieurs mets commandé probablement PAS  un oubli de la part des serveurs et de la cuisine ! Je n'ai jamais reçu mon riz frit  par exemple (que j'ai commandé à 2 reprises) !!! et quand vous commandé 3 portions ils vous en donne 1. Le resto n'était pas occupé mais ils était tous avec un air d'ennui ou en train de texter  Il y a meilleur ailleurs promis !! 34$ avec tips. Oh et il charge 2$ par bouteille de vin qu'il ne serve PAS !!"}
{"text":"Love this all you can eat sushi place ! Plus it's a bring your own wine. The decor is really cool and modern with the Japanese murals.   The only comment is that the variety of the sushi is on the low side but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the best All You Can Eat Sushi place on St. Catherine Street in Downtown Montreal. The sushi is tasty, high quality and delicious. Eat all you want for $16.99 for lunch. You can have Soup, Wok, Teriyaki, Crispy Noodles, Pad Thai, Fried Rice and Dessert if you don't want sushi.  You can B.Y.O.B. The waitstaff are very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is very clean and beautifully decorated. I will be returning to this place for sushi, not the high priced, low quality, rip-off sushi restaurants in the rest of Montreal."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better but today was my 5th time and I was totally disappointed by the low quality of the food and awful service. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I would definitely go back! Apportez votre vin (bring your own wine) and the food comes out super quick so you can keep ordering AYCE. :)"}
{"text":"J'aime les \"all you can eat + BYOW\". 100% satisfaite. Très grande variété de plats qui plairont à tous: sushis, tempura, nouilles, etc. Une belle sélection de desserts: nous avons pris les poires au vin, crème glacé, et sushis-dessert: feuille de riz avec des fraises, avec une petite sauce sucrée... Le service était cordial et rapide. À essayer au centre-ville."}
{"text":"Il va falloir que j'y retourne ,je suis assez mitigé dans mon opinion !!!!!!! Classique pas de quoi se retourner !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On a demandé 30 makis à emporter, on nous a dit 32,99$. Ok, mais après voir payé, on s'est rendus compte que le combo 16 makis au choix était à 12,99$. Service malhonnête."}
{"text":"Worst all you can eat sushi restaurant I've ever been. I have tried many all you can eat sushi restaurant in Montreal and I can say that this is the worst one. It seems nice, but don't get fouled by the decors.  -The rice is dry. I understand this is all you can eat but their sushi is just really bad and I'm not even a picky eater. -Served raw tempura where there is a huge chunk of uncooked, dry flour. -They have both water glasses and wine glasses and they insist of using the wine glass for water and vice versa."}
{"text":"diffilcut to park!  the restaurant is too dark to see something! Their menu is way too confusing and there's too many options. Besides, the food were not fresh. The service was ok!  Wont be back"}
{"text":"My friends brought me here on Saturday for my birthday. We made reservations weeks in advance since we knew how busy it gets. We still had to wait 15 mins at the front. The menu is very elaborate with so much variety. I ordered miso, 4 different makis, tempura pumpkin and sweet potato, octopus balls, dumplings, few handrolls and salmon sashimi. I would have liked to try way more items, but I was simply too full at end. Other reviews said they had missing orders; all of mine were correct. Service is very quick, staff is friendly. I love the atmosphere, the decor and murals on the walls. They were kind enough to store my cake until dessert time. They sung along with my friends. They did not charge a cake fee like some restaurants. I used the restroom which is one private stale. Not practical if very busy. I will definitely return soon and try many more items."}
{"text":"Dans la gamme des restaurants de sushis à volonté, c'est de loin mon préféré. D'abord, parce que c'est un \"Apportez votre vin\", ce qui est essentiel selon moi avec des sushis. Notez par contre que le restaurant vous charge 2$ de la bouteille débouchonnée.  C'est mon préféré surtout parce qu'ils n'offrent pas que des sushis. On a a accès, pour le même prix que le menu servi à volonté, à différents mets asiatiques comme des sautés, des pad thaï et même des burgers de riz (ce que je ne connaissais pas). Tout ce qu'ils servent est frais et délicieux. On se doit d'essayer les tartares, les dumplings et les pizzas sushis. Le service est efficace et les desserts sont à commander en double tellement ils sont succulents.  Personnel gentil, courtois et accueillant. Du dimanche au jeudi, c'est un peu moins dispendieux et ça vaut la peine! L'ambiance est tamisée et chaleureuse, tout y est pour passer une agréable soirée et pour déguster les meilleurs sushis en ville!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst AYCE buffets I have ever eaten at.  The entire menu is not only filled with Chinese-fusion food, there are many other things that went wrong for me:  1. Near the end of the meal, I found a long black hair wrapped inside the roll I was eating. No FOR REAL. I almost threw up on the table. I stopped right then and there.  2. The General Tao / Lemon Chicken pieces don't actually have chicken in them, it's just fried bits of dough, covered in sauce. Also, it's chicken breast. WTF.  3. Fish is subpar. I can go to a grocery store, fillet it myself and have a better sushi-grade fish than what I ate today. The \"oil fish\" was disgusting, and frankly, they covered everything in a sauce to make it edible.  4. The only decent roll was the unagi roll.  5. The portions are super tiny. Like.. miniscule.  6. As we kept ordering more, the portions got smaller and smaller, less frequent, and they didn't even remember things that we put on the list.  7. All the rolls tasted the same. Gross.  8. The shrimp tempura was not the kind you think -- long tiger prawns fried with a batter, they used the cheap Costco cocktail shrimp (the tiny ones) and battered them. WTF.  NEVER.. EVER.. AGAIN. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"We came with about 25 ppl and it was nothing special.  Our food orders kept getting forgotten so we had to order multiple times. To be honest, that's not really their fault because our party was so big but it was still a bit of an inconvenience.  The food itself was lower quality than other AYCE spots I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and eat here before my flight because I was craving sushi and I didn't want to walk far. It's $26.99 for AYCE sushi and other Japanese food.   The selection is wide but not big for sushi, unless u are into rolls. for sashimi or sushi the only one with mentioning is the salmon, oily fish (white fish), beef, and the sweet shrimp sushi. The rice to sushi ratio is horrible. Huge pieces of rice. They put mayo in everything. Which is so gross to me! The salmon sashimi are half the normal sizes of real sashimi so it's bite size. They come in 2 pieces each while the other stuff is 1 piece.   However, if we are talking about there skewers  and tempura. It was really good! It's all made to order so they are nice and hot. The tempura was so fresh and crispy. The beef with mushroom skewer was good. Chicken skewer was basic.   I do appreciate that everything comes in small portions so u don't over eat or order. But it's REALlY small. Maybe I'm American so I'm used to big portions?!   Either way I wouldn't come back unless u are desperate. Oh the good thing it was byo wine."}
{"text":"Makis ok, Nigiri trop de riz, seulement 2 choix en sashimis, service rapide mais plusieurs oublis, prix abordable pour un sushi à volonté, restaurant propre. AVV avec un prix de bouchon."}
{"text":"Sunday dinner for two here, we were pleasantly surprised to find the all-you-can-eat pricing is set up $24.99 Sunday to Thursday, and increased on Friday and Saturday. It wasn't overly packed but there was a decent dinner crowd. The spot is easy to find and surrounded by parking lots - the closest one is $10 outdoor on weekends but a further walk will get you underground for $7, or you can test your luck with street parking. Once you walk in you feel like you're at a slightly upscale restaurant, as they have wine glasses and napkins set out, white chairs, and murals on every wall. Upon seating you'll notice the place setting is perfectly placed at every table, with the chopsticks lined to the edge of the table centered on the paper napkin, and the dishes placed squarely around it - satisfying to those who demand perfect little details in life.  There was a wide selection of food - all the works with the appetizers, sashimi, sushi, maki, hot food...the maki rolls lack diversity but there are a decent number of choices and some unique and creative options. We noted that the sashimi orders come in sets of two pieces, but the pieces are smaller than usual so one order equates to the typical one. We tried a variety of items and found the sashimi to be tasty but everything else hovered around acceptable.  We got the spicy salmon roll and the strawberry and banana roll, both did not meet expectations. The seaweed and rice paper were chewy, and the filling was average. The spicy salmon was not spicy, and chocolate sauce replaced the promised strawberry sauce. The chewy seaweed problem continued to all the other roll items - particularly unfortunate with the hand roll.  The snack items have many options - from takoyaki and fried tofu to barbecue squid and beef rolls. Overall they were average - some items were tasty, others were not so good - and there wasn't much we wanted seconds of.  Dessert offered chocolate, green tea, and mango ice cream - safe choices you can't go wrong with. There was also rice balls which are really tong yuan with no filling, served covered in diluted chocolate sauce and sesame seeds, and there's Japanese small bread which is a deep fried maan tou with the condensed milk drizzled on top already.  Overall, I would return for the sashimi, the convenience of it being priced for weekday on Sunday nights, and the ambiance of the restaurant, but not so much for the variety or taste of their food in general."}
{"text":"The service was very quick. water was refilled promptly and plates were taken away in a timely fashion. The food was on par or better than other sushi all-you-can-eats  AND on top of that they had 2 types of sashimi for the lunch price! A great deal overall, especially with the grand opening promotion (-15% total for students). The new decor is really nice and the chairs are really comfy as well!"}
{"text":"This used to be a Kanda's way back when that chain was at it's low point and the ghost of Kanda still seems to haunt this place i've managed to avoid even though I sushi all over the city.  Fisshu in English sounds pretty close to fishy for me. The French word \"fichu\" also comes to mind, not a good omen.   Exhausted from having spent 9 hours NOT eating at the auto-show and wanting to deviate from my normal downtown favorite AYCE (Kuu Bistro) 2 minutes away, I decided to give a go.  We started the night with about 20 sashimi pices and 20 nigiri sushi, the first was so small and thin but it was nothing compared to the nigiri pieces where the fish was paper thin, almost translucent. I just began eating the fish and leaving the rice ball, just not worth it.  The selection of sushi rolls was not much better, most rolls seemed very similar in taste, even the phoenix fried roll was cold for some reason.  We gave up on sushi after trying 3-4 types of Maki.  The highlights were the short ribs, tempura, beef skewers, chicken wings and salmon teriyaki. There is an entire menu page devoted to Chinese Wok items, rice and noodles, Ramen Soup and many other dishes i have never seen at AYCE such as omelette and Asian burgers  My only issue is that I came to eat Sushi, and that was a letdown, the only way i would recommend it is if someone does not like Sushi but wants to try Pan-Asian cuisine.  It was about half busy for a monday morning and we were seated in the middle at a tiny table. I asked for a larger one but was declined even though there were about 20 empty tables. There was barely any room for the dishes and we kept having to organise and place one dish on top of the other. At least the dishes were constantly being brought and picked up, but why go through this hassle?  I'll stick to Kuu when downtown"}
{"text":"Sushi was good even for a busy night we didn't wait for the long for the food. The variety is good. Love the fact that the salmon sashimi is cut thick! Really happy that the \"cooked\" food comes in small portions so they don't bombard you with a huge dish! Service was great really attentive and less expensive then other sushi places even on weekends!they have more variety in dessert than other places   Something that should be improved though...is the cleanliness of the washrooms.(no toilet paper in all 3 stalls, looks and feels unclean)  BUT other than that one fact, the resto is really good and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place ! Door that kept opening was very very cold and a few things were forgotten to be brought to us... Other then that the food was excellent and fish was fresh. Bring your own wine is great as well ! At the end of the night they gave us a rose with our cheque was a nice surprise ! Thanks for a great night !"}
{"text":"My friend and I were very curious about this place... But they have some work to do sushi-rolling wise. It might be because Im very difficult with my Japanese food, but ya, I can say it's OK for an All you can eat. It didn't really hit the spot. Though the service was very good, decor super nice and artistic, and very comfortable chairs (which is important for the pom pom!). Expect a $2 fee per bottle of wine at the end on your bill if you bring some."}
{"text":"Disastrous all you can eat sushi place. Sushis and sashimi were fine, but chicken and beef were rubbery - we had to return them. Thai noodles were also very bad. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here. Like last time the food was very good but the service is EXTREMELY slow. We brought our own wine but served ourselves. The food came out very slowly, 3.5 hours later we were still eating and not because of the great conversation. We ordered everything from the maki to the sushi to tempura and dumplings, it was all excellent, however trying to find out server was quite a challenge. It was nice that there is a 15% all the month of November."}
{"text":"Summary: Ingredients were not fresh, and the fish to rice ratio is as low as it gets. There is nothing on the menu that I would want to order for a second time aside from maybe the eel and salmon sashimi.  Details: I've been to almost every all-you-can-eat  sushi places in Montreal, and this is by far the worse one for lunch.   It seemed like they can no longer afford the rent for this downtown location as they tried their absolute hardest to cut down on the amount of ingredients in their sushis. I had no idea I was taking regular quality sushi for granted in other all you can eat places until now.   If you want to have passable sushi for lunch, go elsewhere. Don't be attracted to the fact that this is one of the few places that offer sashimi options for lunch!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my friend because it was close to her work. The dumplings were awesome and the rolls were smaller than usual but that just allowed me to sample more kinds before becoming too full of rice to function. The food came out quite fast and the staff was attentive. They made one mistake and tried to pass the blame on the menu and some of the things we ordered never seemed to come until we ordered them a second time. I would like to come back and try their hamburger sushi and other things only available on their supper menu. The price for their AYCE was extremely reasonable, I would definitely recommend this place even for big groups except definitely reserve because they seem to get quite busy."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant. Le buffet à volonté est assez varié et la nourriture est bonne! Cependant, quelques points négatifs: les serveurs sont froids et distants, pas de réel contact. Ils oublient souvent de vous apporter certains plats que vous avez commandé..."}
{"text":"Not coming back. Choices are very limited, service is slow, quality is not good.  Those kind of places where waiters ignore you or look through you as if you were not there.  Choices are very limited compared to other 'all you can eat sushi/oriental'.  Do not even expect from a waiter to ask if you need something... Bottom line, first and last visit.  Price was $16.99 at lunch time."}
{"text":"They've hiked up the price to 28.99$ for the dinner menu. I did eat to my hearts content but 29$ is too much for a sushi buffet.   The service was really fast. I was impressed because they kept bringing out plate after plate in so little time. It's like they already had what we wanted prepared. They also were really swift at clearing the table once you were done with it so you never had any clutter of plates.   It's a nice restaurant. I like the decor and they have my favourite painting on the wall as you enter (The Great Wave off Kanagawa)   The sushi itself was really good. I thought their flavours were on point, their avocado fresh, and their salmon was tasty. Their Philadelphia rolls (cream cheese, cucumber, smoked salmon) had lots of cheese which is rare at AYCE sushi bars. I wish it was avocado instead of cucumber but they tasted great either way.  They were my favourite of the night. My boyfriend really liked the Fisshu rolls. He said they were flavourful.   I ordered their fried tofu and a vegetarian pizza as well and I thought they were really great. A bit too much spicy mayo on the pizza but you can scrape that off. I usually don't order the sushi pizzas but this one I made an exception because it comes packed with avocado! The fried tofu is just so delightfully fluffy and it tastes slightly of soy sauce which I like because it wasn't overwhelming. It was just enough to give it a kick.   Their chicken wings are nice and sweet. I only got one but if I had more stomach capacity I definitely would've ordered more. They were crispy and warm.   For some reason they charge you if you bring in wine/beer which is not ideal but I guess they have to. I don't drink alcohol but my boyfriend brought one beer. It's cool that you get to bring in your own alcohol but since you have to pay its kinda bleh.   I loved the food but given the price you can find other sushi buffets that give the same satisfaction."}
{"text":"The sushi were not the best I've had but they were the best I've had at an ayce, some of the dishes were good and others pretty average.  Im giving the place 4 stars because the service is very good, they bring the food very fast (unlike other ayce that take their time so you get full) and they bring exactly what you ordered. Its also a bring your own bottle but they charge you 2$ for the service which is odd but considering the price is like 24$ (for evening, earlier it is 16$) I did not mind. If my friend and I were to order what we did at a regular sushi we wouldve payed 100$ each. The decor is also beautiful and the dim lights bring a relaxed atmosphere, would defenitely go again!"}
{"text":"Bon sushi à volonté. Mon copain et moi sommes venu un vendredi sur l'heure du midi et c'était full house, on a fait la file pendant environ 10 minutes. Le poisson est frais, les sashimis sont bons. Le seul point négatif est que mon copain a dû demander plusieurs fois pour avoir une feuille de commande vierge."}
{"text":"Amazing all you can eat sushi!!! BYOW Super fresh, service is excellent and food very tasty. Place is not small and not noisy as normally a restaurant that size would be Great for a date, business meeting or just to hangout with friends and enjoy an amazing sushi Can't wait to go back as even their Ice Cream is delicious"}
{"text":"El servicio es muy malo, preguntan si uno verdaderamente se va a comer lo que pidió y traen una cosas por otras, y cuando se les reclama se enojan"}
{"text":"Really great food!  Came here on a date and the food and service were great. Options are seemingly endless, and everything we tried was good.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best Sushi i've ever had to date. Wide menu selection with plenty of options. Haven for Sushi lovers."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi in downtown so far.  This is the only sushi place I know of that you can bring your own alcohol.  They charge $2 per bottle and 50 cents per beer can as corkage fees, which I think is fair.  The only downside:  when the restaurant is busy, some of the items you order goes MIA.  It would be better if they had an iPad ordering system instead of handwritten orders.  The sushi and sashimi was fresh and the cooked and grilled foods were good as well.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Fairly decent lunchtime AYCE sushi place. One of the highlights is the fact that they serve sashimi during lunchtime, which earns them the extra star. Otherwise, everything else is very average, from their sushi to their side dishes. Like any AYCE sushi places, this place is likely ran by Cantonese people, which explains the availability of plates such as General Tao Chicken.  This place does not particularly stand out from other places, except the fact that they serve sashimi during lunchtime. Then again, beware to not abuse from it to the point that they taste like paste in your mouth.   Other things that I think are worth mentioning: clean washroom, nice decor, and average service (from what you would expect from an AYCE place: the occasionally missed order because you ordered too much)."}
{"text":"Très déçu de l'expérience, nous avons réservé hier pour ce soir (31 décembre) à 20h30 et quand nous sommes arrivés on nous a annoncé qu'on avait 2 minutes pour tout commander. Un peu décevant considérant qu'on ne nous a jamais informé que le restaurant fermait à 21h00 lors de la réservation. De plus le personnel ne voulait aucunement nous accommoder (exemple nous donner un prix réduit ou rien considérant que nous ne pouvions pas réellement profiter du all you can eat)"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Saturday ($17 per person). I'm particularly fond of chicken ramen and green tea ice cream. All other choices are pretty good too. Would come for lunch again."}
{"text":"I believe this place is unfairly rated on Yelp by some users. We went by this place today and may I say they offer best sushi in Montreal? Seriously, this place rocks.  Very friendly service + fresh ingredients + Solid menu The portions are well executed (putting the right amount of rice) and your meal doesn't feel as heavy on your stomach. The water they serve, comes from a commercial glass bottle which is always appreciated it's well clean.  I will be back quite soon"}
{"text":"This was a place both enjoyed by my travel partner and I. Her for the sushi find, me because it was all you can eat. One reason I liked this place was because they advertised penalties for leaving food at your table. I'm a proponent of not over-indulging especially at an all-you-can-eat spot.  We were closed to their afternoon closing time, so they were kind enough to mention that. We quickly went through their easily understandable all-you-can-eat menu. If we had questions, they pointed out that we could reference the overall menu with pictures and ingredients. Dining made easy.  I certainly enjoyed all my food and left satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm a real glutton for punishment: time and time again, I return to this dispiriting all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant despite previous letdowns. Well, no more! After submitting this review, I vow to never set foot here again.  It's a pity that the exquisite decor of this establishment is completely ruined by just about everything else. Despite the fast service, the supersonic waiters, although efficient (my euphemism for \"rushed\"), lack communication skills and a cheerful disposition. If you are expecting a friendly and upbeat attitude when the waiters yank your plates away and toss additional plates carelessly on your table, you'll be bitter disappointed.   Furthermore, the lackadaisical Mandarin-speaking staff members incessantly shout at each ocher across the otherwise quiet restaurant, completely ruining the expected Zen atmosphere of a Japanese restaurant. Their ear-splitting and rambunctious yells (and sometimes restaurant gossip) ruin the ambiance and detract from the dining experience.  In terms of food, this restaurant couldn't be any more penny-pinching. The tight-fisted chef sliced my salmon sashimi pieces into the shape of thin veneers, so thin that you can almost see through the fish! And don't even get me started with the nigiri: a disproportionately excessive amount of rice topped with a miserly, meager, scant amount of fish (even less than the aforementioned transparent sashimi!).  Until now, what has kept me coming back was the appeal of the AYCE/BYOW concept, the price, and the location. However, after consistently failing to live up to my very low expectations, it is only logical for me to share my disappointment with the rest of the world and issue a well-intentioned warning!"}
{"text":"The design is nice and service is super quick. However, the taste of the sushi is average at best and the selection is predictable."}
{"text":"Sorry, guys. It was one of the worst culinary experiences in my life. I don't mind paying 30 $ per pers, but I really mind when the food offered for this money is horrible. 1. The photos of the dishes presented in the menu don't correspond to reality. They all seem bigger in the menu. 2. Chef's salad has a very bitter dressing. Impossible to eat. Why using such a bitter sause for a fresh green mix? 3. Maki - all the seafood was overcooked. Shrimps, octopus... everything looked like prepared yesterday and kept in the fridge 4. The rice in the maki and rolls was so...old. We could eat just the salmon, but the little white rice bricks were left in the plate. And the menu says you have to pay 1 $ for each food that you leave in the plate.  5. The rice with sea food was fried in a very bad tasting oil. Impossible to eat. Left in the plate. 6. The vegetables on the wok were not good.  5.All the food that we ordered was brought in 5 min. I mean 6 or 7 dishes in the same time. Obviously, it was not freshly made.  I understand that the concept of the place is \"eat as much as you can\" and people abuse of that freedom, so you have to prepare a lot of food in advance. But guys, sorry, I doubt your clients like eating a lot of shitty food instead of less, but freshly made."}
{"text":"The food is OK. The service is very fast. The ambience is really cozy. However, I would say there are better all you can eat sushi places out there with regards to taste. The bring your own wine  aspect is a very nice touch."}
{"text":"Very good. Fish is very fresh, portions are good.  It's also a byob, which is fantastic. Food comes up really fast, but doesn't seem already-made waiting to be served.  Big step up from kanda, which used to be there."}
{"text":"I went to Fisshu as part of a work event with a group of colleagues who were taking me out for my last week in my 6 month work assignment. The place is located on Ste-Catherine Street across the street from The Bay (La Baie) but on the same side of the street as The Bay (it is on the side of Ste-Catherine opposite the Burger King).  We went there during lunch and this place was crowded. We were a group of 9 people. It gets very busy at lunch so reservations are recommended.  I found that the food was good for all you can eat sushi. In terms of service, I wasn't overly impressed. As an example, half our table ordered wonton soup and the other half ordered hot & sour soup and the people who ordered the wonton soup got it at the beginning whereas the people who ordered the hot & sour soup got their soups after a few plates of sushi were already brought out to the table (and completely finished). We also had to ask about the hot & sour soup order a few times.  For those of you who haven't been to one of these AYCE (all you can eat) type of places in Montreal, basically there is a sheet of paper containing the items that you fill in, marking the quantity of the different items that you want brought to your table. Excluding them bringing the food to you, it is exactly like a buffet in that you pay a fixed price and the only increase in price is if you would order a drink or if you waste food (so you should be careful about how much food you order).  I thought that all the items that we ordered were very good. My personal favourites were the different types of tempura dishes along with the sashimi (raw fish). The sashimi didn't have any type of weird fish smell/taste.  Dessert is included in the price. They had 3 types of ice cream (chocolate, mango, and green tea). I personally had the mango and green tea. One of my colleagues also ordered a type of Japanese sweet bread (not sure of the name) which was on the dessert menu.  I give them 3 stars. They basically lost a star for the service and for restaurants, I only give 5 stars for restaurants that have excellent service, excellent food, and no problems whatsoever."}
{"text":"Was so impressed by this place last year, so decided to give their all-u--can-eat-sushi a try during a Saturday lunch.  Still the same nice clean environment, good service and good food presentation. BUT depends on the items u order, it's a hit or miss kind of place. For example, caviars are great! Salmon sushis are great too. Some cute items like rice balls or burgers (they are just ok, but definitely very cute to look at). Again, pretty good food presentation. Few big 'miss' though. The miso soup looks the part but no tastes! Literally no tastes... too watered down. I felt like I was drink warm/hot water. And all tempura items have no tastes too! So does the tempura sauce, too water down. You know if they water down too much, it's not a good sign, usually it means they are trying to cut costs... and quality suffers. Maki rolls are just ok too. Surprisingly the fried rice or noodles dishes are good!  Overall, This place looks very good and clean, services are good too...only thing missing is the quality of the dishes."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi!! Best I've had in a long time!! Everything was so fresh!"}
{"text":"Really not the best.   As I live in the neighbourhood, I've passed this place many many times. I've always seen full tables and the ambiance is pretty nice. So I decided to try it last night with my boyfriend. We ordered a bunch of the usual: sashimi, maki, wonton soup, chicken ramen, etc.   To start off with the good: the sashimi was really good, it was fresh. I really liked the torched salmon, it had a nice toasted flavour. My boyfriend loved the spicy salmon. The service was fine, the plates arrived promptly. We were given a chilled bottle of water, which was nice.  We also ordered the tartar, which was served in a very bizarre way. Just a tiny scoop of fish in spicy mayo on top of a Pringle! A genuine Pringle. I should've taken a picture... my thoughts when they placed it on the table \"Why?\" We tried it and it was okay, nothing worth writing home about.   I've had many wonton soups in my time and this has got to be the worst. The wontons were horrible, when I bit into it, I was expecting a thin wonton wrapped filled with meat - nope. The dough was extremely thick and there was very limited meat. It felt like I had bit into a wet kleenex. BUT, the soup broth was really tasty, so I ordered another bowl of just the broth. Since, I was nursing a debilitating hangover, I also tried the chicken ramen... again not good. It was extremely salty, had very little broth.   Not to mention, it was pretty expensive at $27.99 per person on a Saturday night. All-in-all, I probably won't be returning, there are better ayce sushi places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and the grilled meats were really fatty. To the extent that both my boyfriend and I ended up choking trying to chew the meat enough to get it down. My boyfriend was physically choking to the point where I had to get up and almost perform the Heimlich maneuver and the wait staff standing right behind him did nothing.   Expensive ($27.99) considering the quality."}
{"text":"The service and environment is good, but I am extremely disappointed at the food. I feel unbelievable that this kind of food can be served in a restaurant. I have been to more than 150 restaurants and this is the first time I think I can cook each and every dish better than the restaurant does.  First came the wonton soup, the wonton is broken.  The rice of sushi is so sticky and too sweet.   I ordered smoked salmon and salmon, but the things they served are exactly the same.  Steak is over cooked, while beef rib is rare.  Riceball is undercooked, there is a taste of toothpaste.  Chicken wing is served with honey on the top. Instead of making honey an ingredient of the sauce, They just put honey on cooked chicken wings. The taste is so strange.  The ice cream is okay. I believe this is because they buy it from the market."}
{"text":"C'est définitivement mon resto de sushis à volonté préféré à Montréal!!! Comparativement aux autres restaurants de sushis dans la même gamme de prix, les sushis sont super frais, l'ambiance est tamisée et c'est beaucoup plus intime. Il y a une large sélection de sushis et de plats.   Le prix est abordable et groooos plus : c'est un apportez votre vin! Le service est super, assez rapide"}
{"text":"I had such a disappointing experience here... the staff really should learn some customer service skills... I've never been \"pushed\" out of a restaurant so aggressively... especially if it's an all you can eat place and we just sat down... you shouldn't give us a 15 minute warning to leave once we start eating our orders. When we asked for a take out box because you literally yelled at us to go, you argued that it's against your policy. I understand that this is a a policy in all restaurants of your type... but seriously.. you're kicking us out!   To review the food... it started great with fresh sashimi and tasty eel sushi... then after we were given our time limit, the quality went down quick."}
{"text":"The disappointment start when you walk in. The waiters all look like they are having the worst day of their lives,no smile no contact it's almost mechanical. The lighting is horrible could barely see not sure if it is like that everyday. ttartar is actually served it on a Pringles like seriously ? The food is not waouw , just decent. Most of the think you can get at any regular sushi place. Only thing I like was the shrimp tempura but it's only because I love shrimp. Worst buffet I've been in Montreal  Waited almost 20 mn to get another order. I've got ignored completely and decided to leave. Even to get the check that a struggle. Worst customer service ever. So so disappointed. Im usually a good tipper but I refuse to do so.  And yea I ask for the check before I started to wirte this review still havent received it"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!!! DO NOT GO TO FISSHU RESTAURANT. Tonight, I went there with two other people and experienced the worst customer experience of my life. Management and servers were terrible. When we asked for the bill, this young waitress had overcharged the bill with a much larger amount. After correcting her,  she returned with a new bill and a horrible attitude. She threw the bill onto our table, and was extremely rude. My friend made a comment that if she were to wait that way, she should not work in restaurants. She replied to him with \"What the fuck do you want?\". Despite the comment being made, I promise you that  we did not disrespect the waitress in any manner prior to this. My other friend proceeded to asked her back the same thing. We had already paid, AND tipped them at this point. The manager walked out and tried to cool us down, but did not listen to anything we said. He told us to calm down or he will call the police. The right thing a manager should have done was calm HIS EMPLOYEE down first instead of disrespecting us. He told us we were screaming too loud, but did not know why we were doing so in the first place. He refused to listen to our complaints and proceeded to  call the cops because we were \"too loud\". As a waitress myself of over 30 years, I have never seen such distasteful and disgusting behaviour come from a management team and restaurant. At the end before we left and before the police came, I explained to him what he should be doing and how he should have acted. He apologized on her behalf, but it was too late.  I will never come back here again, and recommend everyone else to stay away. My Friday night dinner could not have been worse. Please share this and spread their attitude. Thank you."}
{"text":"One of the best all-you-can eat sushi experiences in Downtown Montreal. The interior set-up is very fancy and mimics a fine-dining restaurant. The restaurant itself is also BYOW for special occasions. The sushi and dishes are fresh and varied. There is a different menu for lunch and dinner, so make sure to call ahead and ask for their business hours :)"}
{"text":"Come here hungry, leave full  Nice little place with an all you can eat special for about 27 CAD. Was this the best sushi that I have consumed? No, but it was pretty close. The entire menu in this place is part of the all you can eat special, not just rolls and sushi.  The restaurant was not too crowded, for a Saturday night, my friend and I arrived 1-1.5 hours before closing and there were a few tables available.   The service was pretty efficient and the waiters were pretty nice. Note, order only what you can eat because they will charge you for any food left over, which I think is a fair rule. I will admit that I was a little drunk while I was there, so I can not really remember what did I like the best. However, I did like the saxophonist (with a digital band) playing jazz.   When I come back to Montreal, I will revisit but I need to bring someone with me. I do not want to be THAT guy eating all you can eat sushi alone ;)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and her friend came to this place first. Then she brought me here.   I brought also my friends with me to try this place. We came for lunch. And it's quite nice place.   Good ambiance with nice service. For lunch, you don't have lot of choice for sushi. But enough for your appetites.   Good thing is you can bring your own vin. A bottle of sake would be nice."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant de sushis à volonté a ouvert il y a quelques mois à St-Constant. Un des bons sushis all you can eat, probablement mon préféré sur la rive-sud. Le menu est très varié, les sushis sont supers frais. Nous avons été manger un samedi soir et malgré que toutes les tables étaient prises, le service était plutôt rapide. Ils font aussi la livraison."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a Saturday night and decided to dine here with a group of 6. Almost every table was filled when we walked in and it didn't take too long before we were seated. Oddly enough or perhaps conveniently (?), they had provided us with tempura sauce on the tables already. Normally, tempura sauce is served with an order of tempura. Anywho, service was quick and attentive. We were served with water right away and every time when our bottle of water was empty, someone was always on the ball of replacing it for us. Bravo!   In terms of price, I believe it was around $27 per person which is expected for AYCE on a weekend. Shockingly, their menu is extensive! At first, we thought they gave us two menus to order from but it turns out that both sheets were of different items. The menu was very concise as each item was organized in separate categories (e.g. Deep frieds, Rolls, Skewers, etc).  We ordered a couple of hand rolls and they were great! The sashimi however, does not taste as fresh however, the beer taktaki was good. Aside from your typical miso soup, they also have hot and sour soup but, don't bother. The hot and sour soup was VERY salty. It tasted like they dumped a spoonful of salt into each bowl of soup!! We also ordered some of the deep fried items along with grilled items and they were good. Interestingly, they have dessert rolls - fresh spring rolls wrapped with avocado, strawberries and bananas. My friend ordered second for those as she claims them to be very tasty and refreshing! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try them as I was allergic to bananas.. ):  If you've read my profile blurb, you'd probably know that I'm a big time wine drinker. Once I see something that has to do with wine I gotta try it! They have an item called, Wine Pear and they taste exactly as it sounds. Pear soaked in red wine; crunchy and filled with wine flavour - quite interesting.. I believe you can also bring your own bottle of wine(s) here as multiple wine glasses are set up on the tables. Pretty cool!   There wasn't much for dessert. Mainly ice creams and deep fried items. Oddly, the ice creams were not served in individual bowls instead, all the scoops were placed in one big bowl. Smaller bowls were given to us for self-serve. Not complaining but, just putting it out there as I'm used to getting it served individually. Overall, good food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great location downtown... lunch was very good, but I did think it was a little pricey.  Service was good, fast, food was flowing."}
{"text":"Bouffe moyenne, service mauvais (pas sympathiques, long à prendre les commandes) et à la fin ils ont essayé de nous charger 2 cannettes que nous n'avions pas commandées... pas d'excuse et remboursement en cash d'un montant approximatif, pas aimé l'impression que ça m'a donné qu'ils ont essayé de nous arnaquer. Puis il y a un frais si on apporte une bouteille de vin... c'est quoi ça ?!! Bref, je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi joint for $25 on weekdays. Extensive menu in small portions so you can really try a little bit of everything, which my group of 5 attempted to do. You can also bring in your own wine or beer(not hard liquor). It was also really nice that there were a lot of pictures.  Service: looked like a three man crew in a fairly busy restaurant, but the food comes out super fast. It was unfortunate that they missed a few items when we ordered, but we ordered so much and it came out fast enough that we felt that was forgivable.  Food: I enjoyed the California rolls, skewers, the soup, and especially the fried scallops. The banana rolls were fantastic and the pad Thai was great too. The sandwiches were good but a little strange and definitely avoid the octopus balls...   Overall, we left happy and stuffed. Good place to take your hungry crew and get you sushi fill. We will be back"}
{"text":"Première visite à ce restaurant,le midi. J'ai surtout choisi les mets asiatiques, plutôt que les sushis. Tous les plats étaient excellents, dont les portions étaient généreuses. Intéressant, si vous ne mangez pas tout ce que vous avez commandé, on vous facture un supplément."}
{"text":"Nice decoration, the taste and presentation of sushis are just standart , nothing wow... live music softy kind with a saxoman in a shiny suit .. lovely."}
{"text":"food was not terrible nor great same goes for service standard for all you can eat i guess the best part was the little japanese bread dessert all was quick"}
