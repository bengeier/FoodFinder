{"text":"Sono stato in questo ristorante in quanto curioso delle ottime valutazioni. La location è bella e semplice, con qualche oggetto che ricorda la Francia. Ho preso Penine romanof (vodka), ottime sua come cottura che come presentazione ed Petit Steak Bohème et ses frites maison, taglio semplice ma molto buono senza strafare con condimenti. Il tutto accompagnato da un ottimo vino francese  clos la coutale. Da provare !"}
{"text":"Loved this place,  The quality of the food was excellent.  Two of us had the salmon, which was flown in fresh and exquisitely prepared.  My husband had the linguini, which he loved and my dad really liked the steak.  Our waiter/owner was very patient with us (we know just enough French to be dangerous), explaining what each main course was.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I had their 8oz Filet Mignon, mashed potatoes, assorted vegetables, and a Dijon sauce on the side. Simply, outstanding.   I'm waiting for my dessert right now ... Profiteroles"}
{"text":"Main course (liver) was quite good, but the creme brulee was slightly burned. Service was average as waiter seemed to pay extra attention to ignore us. Very decently priced though..."}
{"text":"Super cute French Restaurant in downtown St-Sauvuer called La Boheme.    My friend girl and I decided on this place to have a nice dinner.   The decor is older but charming and warm.    They have Chalkboard Specials.  Veal, Beef Tartar, Rabbit , Duck, Frogs Legs are some of the items the menu lists.    There are Vegetarian options here.  Great wine prices. We ordered the Calamari it was really good.      We both chose a fish dish. It was delicious and cooked perfectly moist. With the Entree you have a choice of Fries or Mashed Potatoes, or veggies.  The fries were some of the best, they know the secret to good fries here.  The waitress was great and paid attention to us even though it was a slow night and would slack off.     The dishes (apps under 10$, entrees under 20$) and the wine were well priced, its no wonder this place has been around a long time.. 30 Years.    A delicious  Restaurant to try out when in the area."}
{"text":"Une de ses multiples soirées pluvieuses de printemps 2014, mes amis et moi sommes entrés en vitesse dans le premier restaurant à la portée lorsque dame nature s'est mise à être capricieuse...  Je ne suis pas une fan de cuisine française en partant mais j'ai été étonnée par ce petit resto discret de St-Sauveur.  Un service de qualité supérieure sans prétention et une cuisine de haute qualité mais abordable. Étant végétarienne, j'étai même capable d'apprécier les plats de viande de mes amis par leur présentation et les arômes qui s'en dégageant.  La seule raison pour laquelle j,ai donné un quatre au lieu d'un 5 est que mon couscous était un peu fade et sec. Leur spécialité est définitivement la viande qui, je ne me rappelle pas mais sont choisies très soigneusement...et une sélection de vin top notch!   N'attendez pas les caprices de dame nature pour vous y arrêter!"}
{"text":"I was there two weeks ago. Service is fine. Food is ok. We did not actually  find any other nice places to go there. All places are more American style food( steaks , french fries, all fried and deep fried) We wanted smh like european style and we found it. Good place. Good prices.  But nothing really special."}
