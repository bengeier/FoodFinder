{"text":"Unbelievable! Can't believe this gem is so close to my house. Seemingly authentic Mexican food, served up in a delightful way. We received three salsas for our meal (though we asked for them so we could try it): green chile, habenero, and typical salsa. There is also a cold bar for pico de gallo, sour cream, other salsas, etc. I got a 3 steak taco platter which were served very simply with 3 tortillas, each topped with seasoned beef tips, queso fresco, and a sprinkling of cilantro with a lime and roasted jalapeno on the side. The place is the kind where the Mexicans go to eat lol, but the server was very friendly and informative (since I'm as white as they come and speak very little Spanish) and made me feel quite at home. The food was fantastic and they serve beer here too. They've set up shop in the old Bojangle's on Central Ave near Sharon Ave. A must try if you like authentic Mexican food."}

{"text":"IMO this place is a sleeper (in a good way). I would have never went here if it wasn't for a friend of mine taking me here for lunch one day. The food is good and the place looks a lot better inside being they have gotten new furniture and other items. I know very little to no Spanish but I sit in here at lunchtime sometimes and watch Spanish TV like I know every word they are saying LOL. Try them out, the outside may say something different about the place, but the food is good. In my experience some of the worst exterior looking places make some of the best food. Try the chicken fajita lunch special......um um!"}
{"text":"I wish I had brought my camera.  The first was nice but nothing to write home about though I went to this place specifically to try their menudo.  The menudo was nice and made decent.  I do not know about any other place within Charlotte that serves menudo everyday. I only wish they had bigger pieces.  The bowl came out with only meat.  I thought when I tried this in Mexico that they included some veggie or starches with the meal.  They offer guacamole though the menu does not say this.  the place is friendly and clean.  The customers are purely mexican and you may feel out of place if you do not speak spanish."}
