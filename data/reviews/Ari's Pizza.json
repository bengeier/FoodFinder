{"text":"Stopped in for a slice and was very please.  Owner takes pride in his food and as very friendly.  The steak and cheese he was cooking looked awesome.  I will need to stop by again and try it."}
{"text":"So I have been way lazy with regards to reviewing, but after an awesome experience at Ari's I'm back in the game. I had been wanting to try this place for the past couple of months as a couple of fellow Yelpers said it was the home of good legit NY pizza and the place didn't disappoint. The last time I tried to check it out the owner was moving to the new location (no longer on The Plaza, instead he's on 1910 Milton Rd) and didn't have the pizza oven up and running... Fortunately it was running just fine today!  In Plaza Midwood we have plenty of pizza joints (I'm being kind here... Truth is too freaking many) but none of them hit the craving for a nice big floppy slice of NY pizza like Ari's so it's well worth driving a couple of miles. I ordered a large pie with pepperoni (in a purist mood today I suppose) and when I pulled in was warmly greeted by the owner - really cool guy who lived 22 years in NYC. The place is not much to look at yet but this is the kind of place you want to support and see thrive. No website or menu online so I recommend giving it a try and spreading the word in Yelp... Let's keep some good NY pizza in CLT!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have had in Charlotte hands down. Authentic New York style pizza and the owner is very kind and friendly. Soon to have a delivery service and I can wait!!! Large cheese pizza pie for only $11, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but the wings are sooo good. And the philly cheesesteak. OMG!! It is to die for. And it is too big for just one person. And the owner is very friendly and that makes the wait enjoyable. All the food is hot and fresh. You must try this place."}
