{"text":"Food: great ... went for the most expensive item on the menu ... kind of a risk, but what a reward! The meat was cooked the best way possible, the employee took his time but it was done just right. 

Service: employee was very deligent and was telling us about all the options. You can tell he takes his job seriously - always a good sign. 

The biggest weakness was the salad ... but who cares about salads 


5 stars"}
{"text":"Very good inexpensive arabic food.  Clean, cooks use gloves, as opposed to Boustan.  I had the large Shish taouk salad... very good, and it was a huge portion."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food was amazing. Very inexpensive for the copious amounts of food they give you. Prepared right in front of you quickly. 

My wife had the Taouk Plat and the chicken was moist inside and crispy outside. It was perfectly seasoned. Served with an awesome veggie side and hummus and garlic sauce to die for. 

I went with the shawarma pita combo and was not disappointed either. Lots of meat and filling made a perfect meal for a medium hunger."}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal and it was snowing so we didn't want to stray too far from the hotel for a quick dinner. When we got there the place was packed with students so I knew it was going to take a while to get our food. I had the beef shawarma sandwich which was soooo freaking good. It was salty, savory, and tangy thanks to the pickles and had a glaze that made it slightly sweet. I had the potatoes on the side and couldn't stomach anymore because of their large portions. Service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food. Real value for money. Amazing staff and mouth watering food.. You must try the poutine a taouk, one the specialty of Shawarmaz. Will definitely come here every time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"When i went there they din't have any beef left so i had unwillingly to take the chicken shawarma( not a fan of it..).

They have a small and large option, not much of a difference. The pita was good but they din't put onions or hummus? Weird.

On an other note the potatoes were the best, better than boustan's !!! And the garlic sauce way less fat and greasy.
The thing i liked about the pita is that the bread was thin. I wish they would have beef, it would had made my review a good 4 stars.

Overall the meal for two costed 20$. Service was neutral but not cold."}
{"text":"I visited Shawarmaz on my first evening in Montréal, and I was very impressed. I had their shawarma plate, with beef, potatoes, rice, and a salad. The whole plate was delicious. The flavors mixed well, and I liked the salad dressing. My two main complaints were that the beef was a bit dry, and the portion sizes were massive where the plates were small. I couldn't finish my plate because the serving size was too large, but what I did have was delicious. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Horrible cocktails. Food for one person didn't come out at all. Everything was cold. Will never return, would just like to warn everyone."}
{"text":"I'm a Believer!! 
Sometimes when I read reviews I take them with a grain of salt. When you look at the place from the outside your skeptical, small shared space with Subway Sandwiches which is in the front and Shawarmaz is in the rear. When you go in you quickly realize that's where all the customers are as well. And for good reason. We took some of the favorites from other reviewers and glad we did. The Magic Poutine is ridiculously good and unexpected the mix works and is hands down the best Poutine I ever had. The Mix plate of chicken and beef served with rice, potatoes, choice of salad and topped with there special sauce! Off the chain!! Topped it off with spinach turnovers. That was a lot of food for just 2 people. The best part was the price. It's not fancy but Great food, fresh great tasting food for a good value. It's a win."}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh! Kabab skewers were tender juicy, flavourful. Even rice was flavourful! Workers are kind, good customer service."}
{"text":"I had the homemade chicken pita : the food was fresh and tasty, that was so delicious! The service was absolutely amazing: nice and pleasant chef and waiters. Even though the place looks like a regular takeaway shawarma and does not seem like anything particular, it is definitely way better than any other ones I've ever been to in Montreal ! I'm absolutely coming back !"}
{"text":"I only had the beef. Best beef shawerma in Montreal. The lebanese \"mar'ook\" bread they use in their special sandwiches is awesome. And you have the option of no lettuce and adding parsley, tomatoes, onions, and tahini sauce...like how an authentic beef shawerma is supposed to be. I really don't know what's up with shawerma places in Montreal putting lettuce in their shawermas. They don't do that anywhere else in the world. TO ALL ARABIC RESTAURANTS IN MONTREAL...LETTUCE IS A BIG NO NO IN SHAWERMA."}
{"text":"The veggie pita trio was delicious and I wish they had this back in NYC shwarma locations. The plate definitely didn't taste like typical shwarma, however the added fried potatoes were great and the vegetables were tossed with the perfect amount of lemon and vinegar to give it that typical pickled flavour throughout the whole salad. The falafels didn't have that normal chickpea taste, but it was still cooked throughout and did the job. 

Did delivery at 12 am, great service and really friendly on the phone. Would definitely come here again when I visit and try some other items on the menu. 

The only fault I found was the tzaziki sauce, it was just plain yogurt- which was really gross to dip into."}
{"text":"this place is bomb!! i 200% recommend it! the staff is amazing and it was just the best food ever!!! the margarita pizza was stellar and so was the salad"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing quality warm food!! If you're in downtown, make sure to stop by and have a big bite of their special shawarmaz!  

The salad taouk is also outstanding! I can have that everyday!"}
{"text":"Our first meal in Montréal.... Love supporting the local restaurants. Really good food. Simple place. I'll come again!"}
{"text":"Loaded with healthy options, this is the way fast food should be!  My 9 year old and I ate to satiety.  We ordered the pitas at the chef's suggestion and were not disappointed.  The pickled vegetables were delicious.  Friendly, helpful staff for all (including anglophones)."}
{"text":"Great food and grt presentation with excellent customer service !!!! Their poutine and mix platter are amazing"}
{"text":"It's safe to say that I'm a fan of this place. If there was one thing I would recommend, it would be the soujouk magic poutine. The flavour was just perfect, not too salty and just the right amount of spices. The portions are pretty large, so you might be okay with just getting a small. They add parsley, cheese curds, garlic potatoes and top it off with their gravy. I've tried other plates, but I would say this is probably one of their best.

If you're going during lunch hour or dinner time, you'll likely end up waiting. During very busy days, I've waited almost 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, for a place thats inside of Subway, its pretty damn good. my friends and i took a gamble with this one and we were all happy. i loved the chicken schwarma in pita. and its a big portion too. however their hot sauce is not that spicy so ask for more! and prices are pretty reasonable!"}
{"text":"Huge portions of good quality fast food shawarma. I just never thought 'wow, that was delicious!'. We tried a mixed plate, a chicken wrap, and a beef wrap. The wraps used sangak bread instead of pita - others may consider this a plus, but I prefer a less chewy bread for this type of wrap. Service was friendly and efficient, and prices were reasonable. Can't really fault them for anything, it just wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"Typical good quality Lebanese food joint that (thankfully) aggressively took over most of Montreal's fast food chain stores. 

Good quantity + great quality = tummy happy (Yay, math!)

The line was quick to go, the selection was actually bigger than most shawarma stores with the introduction of a hybrid poutine that combines the typical cheese and gravy with a tiny bit of herbs and typical Super-Awesome-Tasting potatoes. The taste is particular and different from the usual poutine as it is much less greasy but none of the less still quite acceptable by The Almighty Poutine standards. Decent quantity but somewhat expensive explainable by the palpable freshness of the ingredients. The amount of chicken on the chicken poutine was somewhat disappointing though!

P.S. When you enter the store, yes, that is indeed a Subway right in front of it. Continue a bit further for the Shawarmaz."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Montreal! Very tidy and nice place to grab your lunch or quick bite. They have great trio option. Fantastic french fries and garlic sauce! If you choose between Shawarmaz and Boustan, go with the first one!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, fresh food. We tried chicken poutine and beef shawarma, which were both great. Portions are huge and pricing is economical. There can be a wait, but the food is all prepared directly in front of you and you can see all the staff working busily. Of course it is not the healthiest option."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite shawarma place in Montreal, from the ones I've tried, sorry Boustan which is pretty popular. Located in the same shop as Subway, its easy to be confused. I've tried both the shawarma and the magic poutine and both are delicious. And damn, their potatoes are beautiful. Get it with the spicy garlic sauce/dip."}
{"text":"This is only a review for the Poutine Magique, which is like a mix between a poutine and Arab-style potatoes with a lil shish taouk and fatoush sprinkled in. Purists might say it's not really a poutine but it was definitely DELICIOUS!!! Quite possibly the best poutine I've ever tasted (but again, is it really a poutine? Or something in a category of its own?)."}
{"text":"Best shawarma place in Montreal 
I really like the traditional bread 
And there special poutine with the garlic potatos 
The service is very good 
To be honest i recommend it for all"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Montreal , the food and the staff 10/10, give it a try if you are in the area, if not make sure you go for a small trip and try it"}
{"text":"I had my first experience eating poutine at Shawarmaz and I can't say that I'm a huge poutine fan now..... 

They have magical poutine on the menu, so obviously I had to try that. Get a small though, because a large is too big to even share between two people. 

The poutine starts off with huge scoops of fried potatoes, the pretty thick cut variety. Then comes the chicken, curds and gravy. The whole things is then topped off with a cream sauce and some chopped parsley. 

I'm not the hugest fan of parsley, but it definitely added some necessary color (and nutrients) to the meal. 

Overall, I thought the whole thing was very salty and the chicken was really dry. I couldn't finish even half of my portion.... 

The servers were.... efficient. Borderline rude, but I've kind of noticed that about more than a few places I've been to in Montreal, unfortunately. 

I don't think I'll be back. I don't even want to order poutine from anywhere else anymore after this experience."}
{"text":"Excellent shawarma et excellente salade.taouk.  Service rapide et tarifs plus que correct. Pour un déjeuner rapide et.pas cher."}
{"text":"Practical because it's next to my office. But not disappointed by the food. Always good but a bit on the greasy side. Had the shawarmaz twice and it was good and filling. Garlic potatoes are also always a hit. Just don't eat there if you have any important meetings in person after. Next thing to try is the poutine which came highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good spot just the food took over a hour.

That poutine tho. If you're thinking of getting a large just do yourself a favour and get a small I couldn't even finish half."}
{"text":"Went there 2 years in a for La Poutine Week and they never cease to impress!
They use garlic potatoes instead of regular fries, topped with shish taouk or shawarma, along with fried onion and crispy pita. Sauce is vegetable based with drizzles of what I remember to be sesame sauce (not tahini).
Portions are generous, and service is very amicable. I would return for sure because I'd like to try their regular menu.  I can honestly say that they have the best garlic potatoes i've had in the city. Mushy center, but crisp on the outside, perfectly seasoned. Miam !
Only downer of the Poutine Magique was the sauce; I found it to be a little bit too salty and cold when served, but I might just be unlucky that time. 
Other than that I had a great experience . They are located within the subway... just make sure you walk right through the back of the room ;) There are limited seating but I think it's not dramatic if the customers occupy some of the subway tables.."}
{"text":"We went there last night before movies, and I have to say that the Magic Poutine delivered in terms of flavor. The first few bites are pretty amazing, with the distinct taste of shawarma and tender chicken filling your mouth. The garlic potatoes really go well with cheese and gravy. And the cheese was squeaky, so you know its fresh!

We both ordered a medium size plate, which was ambitious of us... The food quickly became too salty and overwhelming. We each finished about half a plate before giving up. The rest was packed up and taken home. I actually ate the rest this morning - again, the first few bites were soooo good!

Note: Shawarmaz shares a space with Subway. The poor Subway worker seemed terribly bored... All the customers were heading to Shawarmaz!"}
{"text":"WOW. BEST MIDDLE EASTERN FOOD IVE HAD. High quality fresh ingredients, the difference is in the taste. I can't believe it so well priced, delicious food to suit any appetite! I don't know if I can go back to normal poutine after having their magic poutine, and I'm a poutine addict. Infinite stars"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get shawarma. 
The taste is different and portions are big enough to fill you up. They also make their special magic poutine. 

Prices are decent. A good place to eat if you're shopping downtown and want shawarma. Don't settle for basha or Amir."}
{"text":"Had food here on a whim... the plates are fully loaded and great tasting... good if you need a quicker bite"}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled on this little place. I was skeptical since I saw it shared a space with subway but they did not disappoint. Honestly, I was a bit shocked that the best poutine I've tried since I've been in Montreal happened to be at a shawarma place! There was a bit of a wait time with only one employee managing all the orders but worth the wait. I ordered the beef shawarma pita, sujok pita, manic poutine and some potatoes with their spicy garlic just to sample a bit of everything. All were delicious!! They're also very generous with the meat which is a plus for me. I've had a LOT of shawarmas in my lifetime from MULTIPLE places across Canada and States and this place knows what they're doing. I'm shocked at couple of the poor reviews but don't let it deter you. Will definitely return and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Tasty falafel with a yummy spicy sauce. I also hi the broccoli spinach salad. Just  the right amount of food. Everything looks fresh, place is clean. Good fast food."}
{"text":"We almost didn't order the 'magic poutine', but oh man, were we glad we did. I have had poutine only a handful of times, but this was by far my favorite. We had the magic poutine with garlic potatoes, an assortment of meat and topped off with fried pita chips which gave the dish great texture. 

We also order the shawarma plate and the soujouk. The soujouk was more flavorful, but both dishes were dry. The shawarma plate and the soujouk come with rice, potatoes, salad, hummus and garlic sauce. These dishes were large and left us with plenty of leftover. 

I would not recommend the spinach puffs which were too doughy and bland in flavor.  

Delivery took over 45 mins, but the food came warm."}
{"text":"It's hands down the best shawarma place in whole of North America. The spices are perfect and the food is just delicious.
So glad we discovered this place .."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was so kind. We hadn't ever had shawarma before and they gave great recommendations and made great food."}
{"text":"You Can try the Pita Beef Shawarma All dressed amazing taste, like nowhere in Montreal."}
{"text":"Its really best ever place i have been in montreal i advice you guys to go there and try the food 
Even the staff were so kind and friendly 
Thank you for your service"}
{"text":"Really delicious fast-food Lebanese food that has way more flavour than the likes of Amir and Basha. On Peel, joint with a Subway restaurant -- how anyone can walk in smelling the deliciousness that is Shawarmaz and pick Subway is beyond me!! It wasn't our first time at this resto so we opted to try something new. Their magic poutine is to die for, having won poutine week a couple of years back. The special shawarmaz wrap was very tasty, with a very thin bread used instead of the usual pita, served grilled with garlic potatoes and a drink for $11.50. A must try in the area!"}
{"text":"I was so so happy to finally get a decent shawarma. I ordered a chicken shawarma, with toum, not hummus (makes all the difference), and it was incredibly satisfying. I don't even like chicken! But Shawarmaz was excellent. I got my food to go and I wish I had a chance to visit it once more. The prices are quite cheap, but the portions are a bit small. If you're really hungry, maybe order 2. I can't wait to visit Montreal again just to come here!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal and felt like some Mediterranean food and came across this place.  Authentic,  delicious Lebanese food at a great price.  The manic poutine is ridiculously amazing! One of the greatest things ive ever had.  Definitely check them out"}
{"text":"Very solid food, open until very late, prices are reasonable. 

There is no reason to go out of your way to get to Shawarmaz, but let's be real, we all know the reason you are checking out this place at 2am in the morning!

The large sized gyro was satisfyingly filling, and the small one is good for a lighter snack. Either way, if the hour is late, Shawarmaz is a good place to be"}
{"text":"Small portions... food is good but they got sleazy on the portions. Sad but no longer going"}
{"text":"They share a store with Subway and are located closer to the back of the store. During peak lunch hours on a weekday, there is most certainly a line-up because of all the workplaces nearby. There are many booth and normal seats near the front of the store, but most customers get their food to go. When I had a chicken shawarma for lunch, I found the garlic sauce far too overpowering and strong for my liking, although the price was definitely very reasonable for the portion.

Staff are very polite and speedy with getting everyone's orders and food ready quickly. Overall, would recommend for a quick, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"The server there was rude and in a rush even though no one was even there. They assume that you have been there and are very curt when they ask you questions. I wouldn't care if the service was better but their food wasn't even good. Place looked dirty and the shawarma plate was super dry"}
{"text":"The poutine magic is definitely real - the savory flavors of the potatoes and gravy were balanced out by the acidity in the garlic sauce. A very filling and flavorful dish that's a pretty neat twist on regular poutine!"}
{"text":"I stated my love for Lebanese food before so it's not a surprise I ended up here. I had their famous magical poutine who won the first prize during poutine week last year! I'll let the following words speak for themselves so picture this: fresh and crispy garlic potatoes, Shish taouk chicken, decadent cheese curd, divine tasty sauce and pieces of toasted pita bread in the same damn bowl ! Award winning poutine! They get a standing ovation from me."}
{"text":"Went with their chicken shawarma pita and fattouch salad. I was offered a small or big pita and opted for the small one considering the high price I was looking at. Sadly their small pita is quite small and their large one is the average size one.... well at least to me. I guess this is a nice way to make a few extra bucks. Despite its size the small pita was quite good minus the turnips, the ingredient I specifically requested NOT to add and clearly was ignored.

The fattouch salad was a huge miss. First of all, no pita chips! Ummm, how does this work?? A fattouch to me is not a fattouch without the crispy pita chips. I understand putting them ahead of time in the big tray may render them soggy but at least add it before you serve it? What is going on? Secondly the fattouch salad was faaaaaar too acidic and the acidity completely overwhelmed the salad. I couldn't taste any of the ingredients. Lastly, there should be a limit how much mint you need to put here... daaaamn. All I tasted was the acidic taste and far too much mint. 

2/3 of the salad bowl went straight into the garbage. Not worth the calories.

A 2 star rating seems tough but this lunch cost $14 and really left to be desired at that price-tag. I'd go back one day to try out their meats and completely ignore anything else on their menu.

I cannot trust anyone people who make bad fattouch salads."}
{"text":"I was drunk.  My husband ordered me a wrap of some sort with chicken and veggies.  It was delicious.  Don't get it twisted though...just because I was drunk doesn't mean I don't know what taste good.  The food was delicious!  Fresh, fresh, fresh vegetables! MMMM....Just thinking about it makes me want more.  The sauce was amazing!!  The place is VERY clean especially for a late night/24 hour place.  I wish we had one of these places near me."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I couldn't tell my shawarma from my taouk but Montreal certainly does not lack for Lebanese food.  As it turns out, the whole hummus, falafel, tabbouleh thing squares up pretty good against a traditional north american diet.  I mean they've got potatoes, bread and meat that's being barbecued...vertically! Which is certainly good news since there's practically as many shish taouk places as there are Starbucks.

Shawarmaz caught my eye not only because it's close to the office, but it doesn't have that sketchy look about it that so many of the kebab places around the city seem to have.  That's not to say it isn't odd, because while they apparently have an advertising budget that afforded them a fancy sign, the restaurant is in the back of a Subway Sandwich shop. In a way, being in the back of a Subway can be spun as an advantage.  If the shawarma isn't looking too appealing, a 6\" or foot long is right at hand.

Prices are in line with other lunch spots nearby at about $10 a head.  The plate of food is huge.  I'm not exactly an expert on the cuisine, but I've always enjoyed it.  The chicken wasn't dried out, the potatoes were well-seasoned and probably most telling is that the fresh salad actually seemed fresh.  Sure it's not 5-star cuisine, but it's falafels and kebabs, more or less the Lebanese hamburger.

What cemented this spot in my arsenal of downtown lunchtime dives was the staff. Believe it or not they were actually friendly.  Not really the Lebanese McDonald's, maybe more like the Lebanese Wendy's. Anyways at the very least it beats the shopping mall food courts that saturate the area."}
{"text":"I am from nyc, where shawarmaz can be found on every other block and let me tell you, this place by far has the best shawarmaz I ever had. No question. I was NOT in the hunt for a shawama joint, but came across this place as we were walking to our hotel and decided to give it a try. I ordered the chicken shawarma which was crispy, light and just amazing. I chose the garlic paste over the hummus (which I think really made the shawarma amazing). 

My friend ordered the mixed-plate and I couldn't help but pick on his food. It was just amazing. I never had potatoes seasoned to such perfection as this place did. The mixed platter is DEF the way to go. It has everything and does not leave you feeling like a trans fat oily mess. 

If and when I go back to visit Montreal, I will definitely be making a trip here."}
{"text":"The food was fresh ,the shawarma beef was juicy , don't miss to try the special sweet sauce :)"}
{"text":"The metaphorical thirst for hunger was real for me to day and Shawarmaz quenched it.

I went with the shawarma plate, which came with chicken, rice, potatoes, and salad. The chicken was savory and the rice and potatoes were surprisingly fresh. A great place if you need to grab a quick, filling bite that get's the job done.

The restaurant shares facilities with a subway so there's not a lot of seating, but coming during off hours can help you avoid that problem (plus you can always get it to-go!).

The staff is polite and speedy and the price is decent."}
{"text":"OMG! Open to 1am for incredible food! What a treat! Talk about a ride to FLAVOR TOWN! These guys are serving up BIG spice, lots of taste and piling up your plate!"}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but this was the best poutine we had in Montreal. On our first night in town, our flight got delayed so by the time we got to the hotel we opted to just get delivery and stay in. So glad we did! They were so fast, the delivery guy was friendly, the portion was huge and delicious. The potatoes, gravy, cheese curds were all on point, the shawarma meat on top was tasty, and they had these crispy things on top to add a crunch (note that it was still crunchy even after being in a delivery box!). Can't wait to have this again the next time we visit."}
{"text":"The best poutine I ever had! Ordered the chicken poutine. The fries was crispy, the cheese was half-melted and the chicken was full of flavours. This is exactly the way I wanted my poutine! 
The guy made fresh fries for me and put on some spicy powder on top, made the poutine even more tasty! Love it so much!"}
{"text":"Very solid Lebanese fast food with late-night hours and a shared space with Subway.  The beef and chicken schwarma are slightly dry but well-flavored and pairs deliciously with the garlic sauce. The spinach salad is also a nice spin on a traditional romaine/iceberg version (which is available as well), and the fried potatoes are solid as well.  They also have poutine platters.  Worth a visit.  Platters are about $10-12 and sandwiches $5-7."}
{"text":"When I went there with my coworker, we waited for about 10 minutes to get our orders. The staffs were not very communicative and it took awhile for us to give our orders. Mainly speaking, we felt ignored. 

The food is great. I love their falafel and their salads. 

For the treatment we had, I will go there when I have the patience and the time to wait. Other than that, I will go to another place to get my order. The wait time just kills it for me."}
{"text":"I'm from the Middle East and this is the closest I've come to shawerma from back home--and my whole family agrees. Make sure to get the pomegranate molasses sauce on your shawerma, soooo good! Great portions, will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"Had high hopes when ordering for delivery, unfortunately the food was not the best. We ordered two kafta platters, falafel and cheese turnovers. The falafel was the best by far. The platter was a disaster.
First of all, the kafta was waaay over cooked - very hard to eat, meat was burned and dry. The rice was good, until we found a hair in it. The potatoes and salad, meh. The hummus was not the best either.
The delivery process took an hour, which was not a deal breaker for us had the food been good.
Overall wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted poutine and they have a few different types but I decided to go with the large poutine magique and that was a great decision. The large size is huge and it tastes amazing. It has garlic potatoes, cheese curds, gravy, shish taouk and on top pita chips, a bit of onion and basil in the middle. Everything in this poutine worked really well together especially the pita chips which bring a crispy texture and something I haven't seen in poutine before. The service was good and the present of the poutine was an A+. Overall a good place to eat in the middle of downtown."}
{"text":"We came here for a 1:30am dinner after flying in during the day and passing out. Soo glad we did, it was awesome. We got the poutine magique (garlic potatoes instead of fries) and it was so yummy. Gravy, cheese curds, soujouk, parsley, crispy cracker things. We were going to get beef but the guy suggested we get the soujouk and I'm so glad we did. Fantastic flavor, perfectly spiced and salty. We also got a soujouk platter with tabouleh separately and split both.  Ended up taking some of the poutine home and eating it for lunch the next day and it was still delicious, even a day old and cold. The people were super friendly and our food was ready almost instantly. 

The guy at the counter told me that even though it was my first time he was certain it wouldn't be my last and he is definitely right. Can't wait to go back and I'm so glad they're open late!"}
{"text":"Best Lebanese fast food downtown by far. This place improved their service and they are now able to handle huge line ups in a good timing. Everything on the menu is delicious. They have their own exclusive poutine made with shish meat and it's really good. Might wanna share it because they are huge. The falafels are amongst the best in the city and they are always fried up to order, never just sitting there in the heated buffet. 


Below is the previous review I had on this place before they radically improved. I had rated them a 3 star but they have now earned my 5 star. 

I want to give this place a higher rating so bad but I can't after the 3 last visits. The fist time I went there they had no beef shawarma. Kinda disappointing considering their name is Shawarmaz. But the chicken shawarma was really good. My second and third visit I had the opportunity to get the beef shawarma and it was really good. The potatoes are amazing, you can't go wrong with them. The only reason I am giving such a low rating is the service is really slow. As soon as the staff saw 6 people walk in, all hell broke loose. I was scrambling in the line up to get someone's attention to remind them that i wanted potatoes and that my shawarma has been on the hot plate for way too long."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is flavourful and plentiful and the guys behind the counter have it all down to a science. They were super busy when I was there but it was so much fun to see how they juggle it all with ease. 

Now on to the food.  I had a mixed brochette plate so that's 1 chichen brochette, all white meat, 1 filet minion, 1 soujouk, and 1 other ground beef brochette that I forget the name of. They were all amazing! The meat was tender and so well seasoned. I usually save my favourite bite for last, but there was no way I could pick a favourite, they were all too good. It also came with rice, garlic potatoes and salad as well as homemade hummus and garlic sauce.... so delicious!

My friend got the falafel plate and they are made to order so you can imagine how crispy and fresh they were. She said they were the best she's had in the city.

If you're in the area and love lebanese food, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Montréal. They're located right next to a subway but don't let that fool you. Their poutine is C.R.A.C.K. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"2 hours to deliver - . Never again. Food delivered stone cold. Super disappointed as I've generally had good luck on yelp when I travel. This sucked!"}
{"text":"There's only one thing you ever need to get here...The Magic Poutine...
The Magic Poutine is heaven on earth, sex in your mouth. It's the greatest thing to ever grace my taste buds. Mouthgasm seems like an appropriate description. 

Perfectly seasoned garlic potatoes with perfectly cooked chicken and/or beef, coupled with amazing gravy, and proper Montreal cheese curds makes for the greatest meal you will ever taste. There are 2 sizes, small and large. The large can easily be 2 meals, or one giant delicious meal for all fellow gluttons. It's open late too for all your post drinking meal munchies. 

Definitely check this place out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, yes ... But the service is amazingly terrible, and the people there are in dire need of an attitude check. 

I ordered the magic poutine and a chicken shawarma. They got that simple order wrong and then tried to play it off like it's what I ordered and that shawarma are always beef... Like I don't know what a shawarma is. Perhaps it's because they're not used to black folks there, but it was absolutely odd and condescending. Anyway after asking them to redo the order, they give me my food begrudgingly and don't include any forks, napkins or otherwise in my takeout bag. 

On to the food: the magic poutine is plentiful and savoury. I had the beef version for $10. The chicken shawarma  was $7. They were both pretty good, but perhaps overpriced for regular consumption. Really disappointed by the service and cleanliness of the joint though. Could have easily been 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"I don't know what this was but it definitely wasn't shawarma. This was lamb (possibly beef) chopped up with lemon juice and oregano. The delivery driver seemed to be from the Middle East so I am shocked they let this food out the door. If this was my first shawarma experience, it would have been my last. 

The tabbouleh salad was less offensive but came with its own set of problems. Those problems are simply that both the shawarma and the tabbouleh salad were substandard examples of this type of food."}
{"text":"First time here, wasn't too bad. The Sushi Shwarma was just a cut up shwarma with half the meat of a regular shwarma. Sushi roll is not worth the money. Better to order a plate or a regular pita to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I was sober, but I wasn't impressed by this place. The chicken in my pita was super dry and hard and I felt like he was really stingy with the toppings. The pita also lacked sauce and flavor and seemed expensive given the size. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Great lunch - fresh shawarma and poutine. It was very busy when we were there so they weren't very quick but certainly tasty with great value for money."}
{"text":"You have to walk into a subway restaurant to get to this place but don't be confused. Although these restaurants are in the same building that is where the similarities end.  I ordered the chicken shawarma and my wife ordered the chicken curry. She very quickly wished sh had order what I did. Huge plate with excellent flavor and authenticity."}
{"text":"Very bad for a shawarma fan. Our whole family got sick after we ate the beef shawarma."}
{"text":"Tasty, but it's slapped together. Don't expect anything but an alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Consistent, delicious chicken shawarmas. I ate here 3 times in 2 days to get my fix.  The only negative is having to walk past nasty Subway, which co-habitates in the same building in the front. It's worth braving the looks and smell of subway for Shawarmaz."}
{"text":"The food is really good but I won't be going back or ordering from here again. The first time I ordered I had to callback 3 times. I took 1.5 hours to get to my door. The second time, I had to callback after 2pm because they don't deliver yet... they answered the phone to tell me that and it was 1:54pm. When I called back they didn't answer. Had to call a third time, around 2:30pm to get an answer. The third time I called the guy was rude and somehow they dropped all their payment options, now only dealing in cash. Avoid this place, it's a joke of a buisness."}
{"text":"Very good choice for a shawerma place. Its shawerma sandwiches are more distinctive than other shawerma places in Montreal and more closer to the original Syrian shawerma. Because they use saj bread not pita bread like the rest in montreal. Also it has a very nice poutine plate with garlic potatoes, instead of fries, and shawerma on top. A must try but probably will share it with someone because the portion is huge."}
{"text":"Fast food , au fond du subway, service souriant, copieux, tres salé par contre, ça depanne en tout cas."}
{"text":"Probably the best or rather most authentic shawarma you could find in Montreal. Unlike other shawarma restaurants, Shawarmaz includes the actual ingredients a traditional Lebanese shawarma would include. Excellent Lebanese Canadian fusion  poutine (magical poutine)."}
