{"text":"The flavor of the noodles were definitely good, however not only is the fried chicken bowl impossible to eat, the chicken we had was not edible to say the least. It comes as a drumstick on top of a bowl of noodles and soup, how are you supposed to cut it off the bone with no plate, unless you slosh your soup everywhere? Picking it up and eating it isn't exactly useful because then you're eating a chicken leg and then some noodles afterward? It should be a cohesive dish, not a challenge.  Regarding the fact that it was inedible, let's just say it was cut into and we felt uneasy eating it.... Shortly after we overheard a woman asking for a refund due to her chicken.. so definitely don't get it lol."}
{"text":"I work really close to here and love noodles so though the reviews here are super harsh I tried it. To be honest I don't understand most of the reviews. It's a trendy noodle fusion place, don't expect more.   I was seated immediately (adequate seating for a lunch rush) my waiter was super helpful (knew the whole menu and gave appropriate recommendations), my food came out super quick and was hot and delicious. (Bonus, they have wifi and it's not weird to whip out your computer on a lunch for one.)  I got the spicy octopus udon. It was delicious, however, I didn't know before ordering this dish that I don't like octopus (Trying something new!), so I can't really comment on the octopus itself. I ate everything else in my bowl however and it was perfect.   I also got the fried chicken bun. It was okay, but I should have went with the waiters suggestion (pulled pork, or the west side market)  Anyways, try it for yourself. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I tried the College Ramen and I wish I would have stepped outside my comfort zone more and tried something new! The food was good. The waiter seemed like he had no idea what was going on but he was nice enough. It was really just alright and not a place I will make a point to visit again."}
{"text":"Sometimes on the weekend, you want to duck the crowded noisy places, which is what we wanted to do tonight on during our first visit to Cleveland. And we wanted to walk from our hotel. It fit the bill. And it had to be somewhere my teen boys would feel comfortable eating.  Ambiance: Cool music, slightly loud, but not to loud to talk. Tables have short stools, not chairs, but surprisingly I didn't mind. We were there at 8pm on a Saturday, and it was about medium busy. Our server was a bit methodical in outlining the menu for us, but it was actually very good info, and helpful for us out-of-towners. Overall, I felt like I was in a local city place, as if I was in San Francisco. Oh, and fun cat stuff in the decor.  Appetizers: We had pickle appetizer and edamame. Both good, we all liked the glaze with the edamame. The pickles were an interesting mix, including some salty, but not too hot, kimchee.  Food: Everyone else ordered noodles, so I tried the buns, which are like steamed dumpling dough pancakes wrapped around different selections. While I liked these, I am sure I would have enjoyed the beef briskey ramen special more. My boys liked their ramen and noodles, and my wife flew thru her eggplant ramen dish.  We ate well, we decompressed from a busy day, and we weren't in the din of a touristy joint. Nicely played, Noodle Cat.  The four of us ate (and drank) for just a few pennies shy of $100 before tip."}
{"text":"after a little yelp hiatus, Im back to write my first review since relocating to cleveland.  i usually dont like reviewing places unless i have some positive things to say, but i feel somewhat compelled to write about this place.  being that i am fourth generation japanese, born in seattle, and basically grew up eating ramen on the west coast  (LA's little tokyo, SF's Japantown, and Chinatown in Seattle), i was super stoked to find out about \"Noodlecat\" and could not wait to try it.  after visiting the noodlecat website, and watching the creative story behind the restaurant, i was sure that jonathan sawyer was going to serve up a slam dunk...  boy was i wrong.  my wife and i went on a wednesday night.  though the atmosphere was nothing to write home about, it didnt matter to us.  we were there for the food.  we posted up at one of their high top communal tables in the bar area and got straight to work.  we started off with stone ipa and northpeak wanderer.  the beer selection was mediocre, a couple interesting brews that may pair well with some of the dishes, but there were only 2 beers on tap (both of which the waitress \"couldnt remember\").  the cocktails and wine/sake list seemed decent, but honestly we didnt really spend too much time in that section.  on to the appetizers.  for us, this was the highlight of the meal by far.  honestly, i wish we would have just stopped there.  we tried the wings, which we were told, were the same duckfat chicken wings that are served at sawyers \"other\" restaurant.  i really enjoyed the miso garlic flavor, although the miso was pretty subtle, and the wings were cooked perfectly.  we also had an order of the twice cooked shisito peppers, which were delicious.  they had a nice char to them, with just a hint of spice, and plenty of salt.  a great pairing with our ipa's, and a definite \"must try\".  ok, onto the main event, the noodles.  and this is honestly, where i get a bit confused.  without hesitation, i ordered the pork miso ramen haru baru style, as i love miso ramen.  my wife settled on the kyoto udon.  the noodles were presented in a odd shaped bowl that was very shallow, definitely not your typical noodle soup bowl.  but thats ok, as long as it tastes good right?  well, i immediately noticed that the ratio of stock to noodles was way off (not enough stock), and the presentation  was pretty sloppy.  anyone who has been to a ramen house knows that japanese people like to have things \"in their place\", and the components of a ramen dish are no exception.  mine looked like pulled pork and nori had just been carelessly \"thrown in\".  it did not look appetizing at all.  though mine was nice and hot, id call my wifes luke-warm at best.  but we were too hungry to send it back.  flavor profile was pretty one dimensional as well.  mine tasted heavily of pork with not even a hint of miso.  the broth was fatty, which im usually a fan of, but it just didnt work this time.  my wifes, the same.  the udon broth tasted like canned mushroom soup, and the \"pickled\" tofu didnt not complement the dish at all.  her noodles were cooked properly.  mine were not.  totally overcooked.  in fact, they were so overcooked im not sure if they were even authentic ramen noodles.  they seemed like the generic egg noodles that you can find in the asian section of giant eagle.  or do i dare say it???  like the noodles from a package of top ramen....    anyways, enough is enough.  after seeing their video, and reading the menu, its clear that noodlecat is trying to blend the traditional tokyo style ramen house, and modern american eatery.  sounds interesting right?  well, after trying it, i feel mislead and disappointed.  needless to say, we are not in a hurry to get back."}
{"text":"Tasty ramen.  A little salty for my taste. Fun decor! Very diverse menu. It looks like there is something for everyone. Great way yo warm up on a cold day."}
{"text":"What can I say? Spent $35 on 2 soups, boba and a fountain drink. Food was okay, at best. The boba drink was horrible, but the Pepsi was good. Honestly, wouldn't recommend this place. Unless someone gave you a gift card and you are forced to try it. Not joking!"}
{"text":"I am a ramen fanatic.  I was raised on it and survived my freshman year of college consuming it.  It seemed that a place called Noodlecat would be right up my alley.  I had basic expectations going in and randomly chose to go on a Sunday, which is when they have their all day happy hour.  The setup of the place is cool, our server was great: he was quick and attentive, but not obtrusively so.  Since the first time and subsequent times visiting the stand they have at the West Side Market I have had the opportunity to try all of the steam buns.  They are all super scrumptious, but my favorites are the tonkatsu, the fat casual, and the BBQ pork.  As for the ramen, I am sad to say I was really disappointed.   The broth had as much flavor as hot water and the noodles were reminiscent of Nissin Cup Noodles.  On the bright side, the \"Roscoe's\" fried chicken ramen comes with an order of the aforesaid bird that was the best I have ever had in my life, and I had a southern grandmother who would fry up awesome chicken every day (sorry Granny!)  Even with the ramen being a letdown I would order it again just for that delicious fried fowl.  I am willing to give the ramen another try, but I would go on any given Sunday for half priced steam buns."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place so hubby and I went for lunch.  The place was really cute and trendy and the service was very good.  The hostess was also our waitress and was really helpful.  My husband ordered the pork ramen and I ordered the day's special which was crab with soba and egg.  Totally lackluster...noodles had weird texture and my broth came out lukewarm!  At least my husband's broth was hot and tasty but, again, the texture of the noodles were off.  I've had lots of noodle soups both homemade and at restaurant and these were just \"different\", not to my taste."}
{"text":"I used to eat here often when I worked downtown. They have a wide variety of noodles, with a wider variety of flavors. The service was always good and pretty fast."}
{"text":"Tiny portions, and they won't even serve noodles during happy hour. Not to mention the 10 members of staff that were buzzing around were really distracting. Hopefully they can improve."}
{"text":"I ordered the spare rib with the Ohio noodles and was satisfied. Service was a little slow but that is to be expected on a busy night. Spare rib come out a little chewy but the 6-minute egg was cooked to perfection. Ambiance is urban and off-beat but has a certain love or hate charm to it. Ended up with a free order of 4 assorted steamed buns but only on the account of the waitress messing up. The checklist order system is supposed to rule these issues out but some times there are slip ups."}
{"text":"Apparently this place isn't as good as it sounds like from the other reviews. I went Noodlecat for dinner. The noodle volume was too little, and it hardly could fill up your blow."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying Noodlecat and was bummed when it sucked. Fried chicken ramen was below the quality a college kid makes in a dorm room. Broth had no flavor. Sticking a fried chicken leg in broth ruins the crunch. Amateur hour. My wife had steamed buns. Order was wrong. Was corrected but the filling was seriously lacking. Fries tasted good but it's like eating crumbled potato chips. $25 to learn we will not be back."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just uneducated about how ramen \"should\" taste or Japanese food in general. But I've never actually had anything besides what they give you at Sake. This tasted so much better! I've never had miso before and I found myself enjoying it immensely! Especially paired with an avocado with seat salt sprinkled on it. I have a new way of eating avocado. The service was excellent though it was right before an Indians game and the Browns pre-season game. It went well with a Sapporo. The prices were a bit high for what you got but it's so much better than the 10 packet for a dollar stuff you eat in college. =D"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been twice in the past month and had a great time on both occasions. The waiter for our first visit, Adam, was knowledgeable and genuinely nice. He did a great job recommending things on the menu and definitely contributed to the good time we had that evening. At one point he accidentally poured water into our Saki glass-- and graciously replaced our drink and did a great job from start to finish for the night. We would definitely recommend Noodle Cat for a fun night out that isn't too hard on the pocketbook."}
{"text":"Yummy menu and lots of gluten free options. The pickle sampler and Japanese cobb were amazing."}
{"text":"Probably the worst noodle/ramen place I've ever been to. Small portion, not tasty, and very \"cheaply\" made IMO."}
{"text":"I ordered a take out order of wings.  It was't busy at all so they were fast with getting the order ready. When I got home the wings were small and REALLY Salty! I could only eat 3 because the taste was so bad.  Wouldn't recommend the wings at all. Maybe the Ramen is good but I have not tried it. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Had the pork-miso ramen and the pulled pork buns. Ramen texture was similar to Maruchan instant ramen and soba noodles. Char-Siu did not taste authentic nor did the soup base (tasted just like miso and shoyu). Pulled pork bun was also drenched in BBQ sauce and overtly sweet. Overall, this is not authentic Japanese ramen restaurant...What brings this restaurant down further is that I was seated and IGNORED for 10 minutes (i actually kept looking at my watch) before a waiter asked if anyone has taken my order. I sat and watched while another waiter (female) was busy fawning over other customers and then had the audacity to stand around at the register right next to where I was seated by myself (while these customers were deciding on their order). Piss poor customer service along with lackluster food."}
{"text":"Jonathon Sawyer, thank you for bringing such high quality to Cleveland. I'm a big fan of Greenhouse Tavern so a year ago I tried Noodlecat three times but was severely disappointed. Since getting a new job downtown,  I've been three times in the past two months and it's a complete 180 from before. The food is fantastic: no longer salty and greasy - just fresh and rich with flavor. The lunch combo 1/2 noodle and 1/2 salad is a lot of food for the price. I especially love the perch steam bun, miso pork ramen, seaweed salad, and super salad. If you tried this place before and were underwhelmed, it's worth another try."}
{"text":"Not very good. The noodles came cold. It was not very healthy nor flavorful. It was basically cold noodles in grease.  If they'd like to get better they need to : 1. Serve dishes hot 2. Not use so much oil 3. Improve flavor. Spice is not flavor.  Spicy level was just right for me but it was still lacking in flavor. Also never serve soups cold. Poor experience."}
{"text":"The food was fine but it was so incredibly, spectacularly undermined by the service that it left a bad taste in my mouth. On a cold, rainy night a bowl of soup should be nice, right? Not when paired with staff who take minutes to dismissively show up and throw menus at you. Not when you request gluten free noodles and get wheat. Not when the server asks you half-way into your meal if you want dessert. Not when she comes back five minutes later with the check and tells you \"it's, you know, no rush\". (And why was she in little shorts when it's freezing out? Is this a hipster Hooters?) Not when the music is Metallica and Nine Inch Nails and it's 6pm and you're sober because the house cocktail was undrinkable. The friggin' worst."}
{"text":"I was very generous with the 3 star rating. It is not bad but it is definitely not great. I feel bad because they want to succeed so bad and the staff was very excited and optimistic when it opened up. I love salt and tend to over salt my food but their noodle dishes were even a little salty for me. If the prices were a little lower I would probably go more often. I understand the whole art form of the udon noodle but even at lunch your spending minimum $15 per person with tax and tip and no drink but your leaving hungry. I would only recommend it if you really want to try what real ramen noodles are."}
{"text":"The service and green tea were good. The College Ramen was a little salty with an idea of chicken. $15 was way overpriced for the amount of meat."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  It started off great with the appetizers!  We ordered the crispy brussel sprouts, the seaweed soba salad and the tempura vegetables.  I have to say they were all really great.  We then ordered the noodles with great anticipation and all (dan dan and the octopus udon) were just horrible!  No other way to describe them.  I don't know how they could go so wrong!  The packaged ramen that you get for pennies are a culinary treat comparatively.  The menu describes each dish that includes such great flavor, but all is lost in the execution.  In the end, you only taste the heat from the peppers!  I wonder if the chef who may have designed all the recipes knows how poorly his dishes are being executed for his customers.  All in all, very disappointing..."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night, and it was okay.  I thought the noodle dishes were a good portion, but the price was a little too high for what we were eating.  For the three of us we got 3 dinner bowls, an order of \"ohio edamame\" and one drink, and with tip and tax it was almot $60!    The food itself was decent, but the \"ohio edamame\" was a big let down.  I guess we should have paid more attention to the quotation marks because it was actually snap peas covered in oil.  Not a big fan.   I would consider going here again if the price wasn't so high."}
{"text":"My sister, cousin and dad took me here as like a last meal in Cleveland before I went back to college. It was a pretty tasty good-bye meal.  We tried two types of chicken wings, the barbecue and the garlic, I believe. I love how the meat came right off the chicken wing without any effort so you were literally cleaning it to the bone. The flavors on the wing were delicious.  I had the Takahachi Ramen for my main meal with pork, somewhat bland, but very soothing. Our server was very friendly and always brought us everything when we needed it. So service and food were pretty good, just thought the ramen was a bit bland."}
{"text":"When Noodlecat opened, I was very excited that Cleveland was getting its first ramen restaurant. The Japanese restaurants around here primarily center around either sushi or hibachi. When their menus do have ramen on them, it is usually the frozen prepackaged type. There are plenty of Vietnamese restaurants serving pho close to downtown, but ramen is a completely different animal.   Having read the other reviews, my expectations were tempered. I didn't expect it to be the authentic hakata or sapporo style ramen that I had when I was in Las Vegas that cost $7 for a large bowl and inspired me to spend 2 months developing a recipe to satisfy my new obsession.  Here's a synopsis of what we had:  Takahachi Raman - If it wasn't for the garlic, this wouldn't have much of any taste. The shredded pork becomes a tangled mush in the soup.  Fried Chicken and Ramen - I didn't get any sense of fried chicken in the soup. Maple syrup and hot sauce on fried chicken is always a good combination, but the breading and the chicken itself was not seasoned. The leg piece is a a bad accompaniment with a dish that you eat with chopsticks and a spoon.  Ohio Beef Brisket and Matzo Ramen - This one was the most disappointing. The beef was good, but the broth had almost no taste. The matzo ball was flavorless, extremely dense, surprisingly cold and I had to spit it out. When I got home that night, I made my own matzo ball soup from scratch in the hopes of forgetting this travesty.  Pork Miso Ramen - They've revised their menu so this is no longer served in the downtown location. It was the only soup that had a strong flavor, but of soy sauce instead of miso. It's dark and thin which tells you that this is really lacking in miso.  Spicy Octopus Stir Fry Udon - It's reminiscent of the noodles that you might get at a Mongolian Barbeque restaurant. Lots of spice, but lacking in complexity.  Tempura Walleye Steam Bun - The small piece of fish had a thin soggy batter. The bun itself is the frozen Chinese type that cost a couple bucks for a package.  Overall, it is pricey even during happy hour and what you get is just passable. I'm still glad that there's more variety now in downtown rather than just another sandwich shop. There are several good ideas that need work and I hope that they hire a consultant to help with the recipes. The owner is friendly and the staff did a good job. I think this place could be a part of the food revolution happening here if it can adapt quickly to be more than just a niche place for hipsters."}
{"text":"I had college ramen, D had pork ramen and we had 2 steam buns. Sad to say the steam buns (which were mediocre at best) were the best part of the meal. We got octopus ramen to take home.  -Ramen was AWFUL! Large portion of mediocrity. Extremely bland.  -\"Spicy\" octopus ramen had 2 pieces of octopus and tasted like straight up sriracha. Not spicy.  -steam buns were on special ($2) and were the best part of meal.  We went on a Friday night and the place was deserted. Bottom line: 1/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Probably been here more than anywhere else in Cleveland (out of towners). Always a great meal. The pork miso ramen is my go to  but I've had other noodle dishes on the menu that are also great. The buns are also good-cab burger, shredded pork and Korean fried chicken. Cool vibe. Parking/traffic can be tough but worth it."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great - hipster music, cute cartoons on the walls, friendly servers, etc.  I can imagine this would be a fun place to pop by for drinks.  I thought the food was middling - not bad, but rather expensive for noodles, and seemed more \"salted\" than \"spiced.\"  We might've just guessed wrong while ordering, but we did try three entrees and an appetizer dish.  We were pleased that there was a separate vegan menu - so there were plenty of options, and no need for vigilance in ordering."}
{"text":"Went to Noodlecat at the West Side Market on a cold, rainy Saturday.  The Pork Ramen was delicious but became perfect with just a couple shakes of the pepper sauce.  The Butcher's bun of the day -- pastrami with pickled cucumbers and onions --was also great.  Overall I'd say a good value for a snack in the market.  The servers working the counter seemed not so happy to be there."}
{"text":"Just AWFUL.  The servers are rude, the food was worse.  No attempt to serve the food while its fresh or hot -- although undercooked hard noodles won't be fixed by being served while hot -- they need to be cooked properly.  No explanation from server who turned her back while we were speaking to her.  So bad we walked out."}
{"text":"I've had udon, ramen, and soba all over the world including in Japan. This place is terrific. The spice set they use is outstanding. I'd keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I loved it!  My current cleveland favorite!  Fantastic ramen and service.  Food is incredible.  Made me feel like I was back at my favorite ramen place in LA on the strip.  Eating here made me very happy :))). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My main complaint is the cost.  These dishes are well made. But their primary ingredient is a very inexpensive ingredient-- even if they are made in-house -- NOODLES!  The ingredients are fresh, so that's great.  The recipes are nothing special. Tasty but sort of bland and not really anything to knock your socks off.  Me and my girlfriend both had the nama ramen with coconut curry tonkatsu.  We also had 2 buns and 2 sodas. The sodas are high-end natural sodas. But $4 for a single small bottle of soda?? So 2 noodle dishes, 2 sodas, and 2 buns came up to $35.  THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS????  (Yes, I tipped 20% so that brought the tab to $42.)  Bottom line:  tasted okay, fresh ingredients, buns are the best thing on the menu, but way over-priced hipster food.  If you're going to go,  here's what you do:  the buns are $3.50 each but they give you 4 buns for the \"deal\" of $11.  Order 4 buns and drink water.  $11 and you'll have a tasty, fresh dinner at a total hipster joint.  The larger issue of food joints like this is the gentrification of cities.  Rents in downtown areas are very high for places like this and they have to attract the \"hip\" people making money.  It's a bad trend for a city like Cleveland and many other cities around America.  Wages are falling for average people but places like this spring up in urban areas, downtown areas and they have to cater to hipsters who make money.  Really, we don't need food joints like this."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoyed the food in the past. went there last night and was very disappointed.  The coconut curry bowl used to be a ramen soup, but this time I received a pile of very salty noodles, no broth. It was supposed to have tofu, but there was no tofu and instead they put potatoes in it. My boyfriend eats everything and he got the octopus bowl. He barely touched it because it was so SALTY.  I'm very sad that things have gone downhill and hope Noodlecat can come back to the way they were."}
{"text":"Strange assortment of good flavors and pedestrian ones.  Had the House Ramen with short ribs, where the ramen was nondescript (2 stars) but the ribs were excellent (5 stars).  Also, had a bacon bun on the side, which was fantastic (5 stars).  GHT lager draft was horrrendous (1 star).  Probably my own fault for ordering that selection of foods."}
{"text":"Headline: Noodles did not impress, super salad to the rescue!  Pork miso ramen.  The broth was super oily and a bit overseasoned.  The noodles were on the thin side.  I've lived in Asia so have high ramen standards but this was subpar.   Super salad-with kale, avocado, and ancient grains.  This was a redeeming dish..enjoyed it much more than the noodles  Centrally located, close to the Ritz or Renaissance in downtown Cleveland"}
{"text":"WOW, Noodle Cat exceeded every expectation I had. I ordered the special; Trentina-foraged maitake with Tokyo greens, shio kombu, soba noodles, in a unctuous mushroom sauce, it was fantastic. Whatever you order be sure it has mushrooms, their mushrooms are out of this world. My hubby had the Buttermilk, honey, and hot sauce fried chicken. You haven't lived until you have this chicken. And being new to Noodle Cat, we also shared four steam buns, every one was delicious. And the broccoli appetizer was to die for! Noodle Cat is a must in Cleveland. Chef Andy was personable as well as gifted. Don't forget the Saki.  mmmm."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I went to the Greenhouse about two years ago and wasn't impressed...at all.  Well Noodlecat didn't impress either.  First off, the quality of Asian cuisine in NE Ohio is top-notch. The surrounding areas are littered with economic choices that leave the belly full with quality food without torching one's wallet. Noodlecat definitely doesn't fit that mold. The food was tasty, but I can't see myself ever spending $12 for a bowl a soup again anytime soon.  With so many other choices within a ten minute drive, Noodlecat falls short of providing any value.  The portions are small and the taste wasn't good enough to offset it.  I had the Takahachi Ramen and the non-meat steam bun.  The name escapes me.  I was absolutely starving after I finished.  The bartender was cool and they do have Black Label for $2, and $1 during Happy hour.  But, inexpensive crappy beer doesn't do much when I was there to eat.  Location is undesirable as well as parking is always a nightmare down there.  Maybe I was expecting more but, I would go back only if I wanted to eat downtown and everything else was booked.  The service was good."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Noodlecat last night after weeks of intending to go and forgetting.  A friend told me that the wings and steam buns are delicious but that he was underwhelmed by the noodles.  I still had high hopes and ordered the miso bbq and spicy wings and the Takahachi Ramen.  The wings were delicious, as promised.  The miso bbq wings in particular were so full of flavor and the meat just fell right off the bones.  The spicy wings were good as well, but I thought they had a bit of a strange aftertaste.    The Takahachi Ramen was good, but I can't say that it blew me away.  I love garlic and since the dish boasted both a garlic pork broth and crispy garlic I expected a strong garlicky flavor that didn't seem to come through as much as I would have liked.  I was also slightly disappointed at the amount of pork in the dish.  There definitely could have been more.  Other than that the dish was a good balance of broth and ingredients.  My dining companion ordered the College Ramen and enjoyed it.  Service was great, although I might go so far to say as our server was a little too present.  It was pretty dead though, so maybe she didn't have much else to do.  I'll probably be going back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"The service and food were fabulous.  Server explained the menu thoroughly. Servings were huge, I could have shared.  Definitely recommend and will try again if we are ever back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I used to truly love Noodlecat before they changed their menu.   It doesn't feel like you are at a ramen shop anymore.   Meh."}
{"text":"11/23 lunch time...  Wife and I walked in, greeted by loud punk music and no server.  I'm perfectly OK with loud music and am of the generation of 80s punk, but this wasn't good.    Wait 3-5 minutes for someone to show up at the host (ish) desk... all the while perusing the two tables-of-six with no food.  Appears that NC had a skeleton crew working the lunch.  I get it... day after thanksgiving.  Given our choice of seats but wanting to sit away from tables-of-six, we choose the one \"oh, but you can't sit there\" table.  Our choice was then reduced by one.  So we sit in the corner, near the quieter table-of-six and our server comes by to describe the specials of the day, then takes our drink order while we check the menu.  Water arrives quickly.  Some 5 minutes later, we're ready to order... alas, the \"table which shall not be taken\" is filled with friends/ acquaintances of the chef-dude (not the owner).  Chef-dude sits with the newly-arrived gang BSing while I wait to place my order.  Server-dude takes friend/ acquaintance drink order while ignoring my table.    Freind-table's drink order arrives with a dish of \"compliments of chef-dude\" pickled stuff.  I'm still waiting to place my food order, now some 15-20 minutes after being seated.  Now I spy a table of two young ladies who arrived long after I did... someone else is on the game and is taking their lunch order.  Because my time has now been wasted and is much more valuable than NC's food... I walk.  Bottom line... I have generally enjoyed Noodlecat's food when I've been there, but the service is usually lacking.  In this case, the service was sadly below \"lacking.\"  Here's to hoping the NC crew gets some training from the Greenhouse team.  PS:  I still hope NC succeeds and I assume they will, having been open now for some time.  I hope if they see this they'll take this as constructive criticism from a downtown resident.  Maybe  it was just an off-day or a minor slip."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the West Side Market, and I love the Noodle Cat stand. I recently became a student at CSU, and your downtown location is on my way home. After a long day, I stopped in to eat. I was greeted by a tiny adorable blonde with a scowl on her face. She tossed a menu at me and walked away. I did not notice that there was a computer underneath the bar in front of me and after she took the order next to me,  she stood in front of me,  so I started to give her an order.  She was pretty pissed and I apologized,  but with no response.  There were only 4 of us in the bar. I didn't realize she was too busy to put in two bowls of soup at once.  I took my food togo because I felt embarrassed not welcome. I am a bartender at 2 local music venues and I know what it's like to deal work customers who are rude or treat you badly,  but I did neither.  I was nothing but nice.  Jane, you treated me like sh#t. I tipped you because I am better than you,  at this job and at treating people with respect. A big thank you,  too, to the girl on this same shift watching the door. What horrible attitudes.  Guess I'll stick to the nice guy at the market."}
{"text":"Just the simple fact of a vegetarian and/or vegan subtext along with gluten-free option and Sapporo on draft--wow. Decent prices, great service, my server gave me great tips on the vegetarian routes and wow, so tasty! Amazing broth on the Tempura uhhhh, saganora? She told me twice and I bloody well forgot! Very impressed, very satisfying--especially on a bike"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place while in the Cleveland area. We stopped in for lunch and it was not too crowded. We found a space near the back bar area.  You pick out your meal by marking on the paper menus on the table and handing it to your waiter. The menu has quite a bit on it so I asked for some suggestions and was pointed in the right direction. We started lunch with the J-Fried chicken steam buns, which are worth a try.  For my lunch I chose the crispy beef short rib ramen and it was delicious. The serving size is large and overall very tasty. This is a fun, trendy little restaurant to stop in for a meal."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp proves to be infested by Gordon Ramsay wannabees, overly critical and guilty of over analysis.    I had dinner at Noodlecat during Thanksgiving weekend, my third visit since July.  Each time I've attended with a different party and each time we've come away impressed and well fed.  Perhaps my expectations are just different but Noodlecat has not only met but exceeded them each time. I love that it is casual, a tad funky and away from the 4th Street chaos.  Wait staff has always been friendly and adequate - not overly impressive because I don't think they need to be.  The beverages tend to try a little hard when it comes to cocktails and the Gus's Soda is overpriced.    The food has been excellent every time.  I've had the wings on each visit: fall-off-the-bone and just solid.  The twice cooked process is obviously taken from GHT but why not when you use unique, asian twist.  Gyoza was plump and satisfying.  Tried the pickle sampler on last visit and loved it - a nice combination of varying flavors and heat.  Ghost chili pickled asparagus were incredible while pickled pumpkin was a first.  Worth the price.  The Steam Buns are perfect for unadventurous newbies or regulars alike.  I gravitate toward the pork version or fried chicken because the burger version provided no wow factor.  The noodles are the star of the show - flavorful, nice consistency, filling.  Again, I lean toward the pork but had a very good beef brisket/matzo last.    It's reviews of restaurants like Noodlecat that make me believe Yelp has jumped the shark."}
{"text":"I took my family here for dinner tonight. We were seated fairly quickly, but sadly everything after that was a bit disappointing. First of all, the waiter (a young fella) was very lackadaisical in giving us service. He didn't offer us any drinks, not even water, when we got seated. I had to ask someone else on the staff for water because our waiter never came around to serve drinks. Our meal order took almost 30 minutes to come out. Not sure why it took so long to prepare because the place was only 1/3 full. And it's ramen! (It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to prepare -- you just need to keep the broth constantly heated in a pot and add everything else at any moment.) And when our meal finally came out, my ramen was almost cold! No exaggeration. It was at best lukewarm. That is a no-no. When served, the ramen should come out with steam rising and perfuming the room with the ramen smell. None of that happened. I am an Asian man who has had his share of ramen meals in the US and Asian countries. I mean how could you get that wrong?  I would have asked the waiter to take it back and heat it up, but by then I was really hungry and my toddler was starting to act out. We needed to get our meal and get the heck out. We gulped our meal down quickly. Lastly, I waited for the waiter to come by for our check for a while to no avail. Several minutes passed without seeing our waiter (or anyone from the staff for that matter) at which point I got out of my seat to find someone in the back for the check. Evidently, they seemed really understaffed for that hour -- a dinner hour. The only positive was the flavor of the ramen; it was acceptable. Too bad everything else was poor."}
{"text":"????? ?????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant before. My boyfriend was so excited to try this place. We ended up leaving early before we could finish our food. First of all, I get that it's a Japanese restaurant. But for God's sake this is America. Serve REAL soft drinks. Gus's soda or whatever it's called is dry. And not good at all.   I ordered the college ramen. I could have made it better at home (and for way cheaper) My food was so bland. I had to dump the hot sauce at the table and the spices to even give it any flavor. Seriously, next time I'll just boil some campbell's chicken broth and throw some noodles in, and have a way better meal.  The only saving grace was the buns that they served. But even those won't entice me to come back. We ended up leaving and going to corner alley to eat."}
{"text":"Somehow I am addicted to the vegan Dan Dan Ramen so, I keep going here.  However, I think that particular dish seems sort of expensive.  It doesn't come with a protein & when I add tofu, they forget (but I still pay) about a third of the time and don't really seem to care.  I am happy they have vegan stuff.  Sometimes due to inconsistencies in taste, type of noodles used, & what is printed on the receipt, I wonder if they are always remembering to make it vegan.  I don't mind them messing up an order while I dine in (which happens), but for take-out its a hassle.  The brussels sprouts are good.  I am sad they no longer have gyoza."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week & could choose from any steam buns and any of the noodle bowls.  Had short ribs & chicken buns - absolutely awesome!  Doet (our wait person) was kind of incredible  - ask for him!  He knows the food & the science behind the food - and the wonderful selection of Sake!! Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place (being from NY I'm a big ramen lover) but I ended up being disappointed. When I walked through the door there was no-one there to instruct me how to order take-out. I walked back to the bar and the bartender/waitress gave me a menu/ sheet to fill out my order. Then she disappeared for 10 minutes. I had long since determined my order by the time she arrived and then she disappeared again. Finally she brought me a check, before my food arrived, and processed my payment in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the fiery dan dan with the house ramen noodles. I imagined that it would be more of a soup than it was. It ended up being noodles with some sauce. There was nothing offensive about the dish, but there was also nothing exciting about it. I would consider going back to try something else on the menu, but my experience of their customer service leaves me inclined to not revisit Noodlecat."}
{"text":"I really really really loved noodlecat.  I've been there twice so far and I will continue to go back.  Last time I was there I had the Soba Tempura bowl with a fried egg and extra greens, and it was AMAZING.  I love that I can now go to a place in cleveland and order food that is healthy and delicious.  I love food, but I also love to eat veggies and greens.  This is the place to go for that, their salads are incredible!! I'm not into american food at all, I generally like all sorts of asian food.  Its healthier and tastier!  So if you're into something different, GO TO NOODLECAT.  Its also adorable inside, little cat comics at every table and anime in the bathroom.  And if you're looking for a good drink, try the organic sake by the glass.  I can't wait to go back to noodlecat :)"}
{"text":"Was excited to try Noodlecat however was disappointed We ordered the Brussel sprout and broccoli appetizer and it was like eating pure oil.  We had the cauliflower curry bowl it was ok but missing something.  The spicy octopus bowl was very spicy and would of been more enjoyable if it wasn't too spicy.  That's my personal preference.  Overall, I was expecting more and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Neat-o little place. Go for happy hour for good drink prices (dollar black label, holla!), and the steam rolls are also in on the happy hour deal.   No regular soda (like coke or sprite and such), only the organic/gluten free/all natural stuff..where's the fun in that? Good noodles, half sizes are an excellent size if you fill up quick like me.   Note: bathrooms are labeled \"arf and meow\". Men are arf, women meow."}
{"text":"Man....I REALLY wanted to like this place. I'm normally pretty easy to please especially when it comes to warm noodle dishes. I've tried NoodleCat twice and will not be back. The first time I was in I ordered the fiery dan dan, which was WAY over salted. I don't have sensitive tastebuds by anymeans but this noodle dish was so salty it wasn't enjoyable. I came back again to give them another shot and ordered the Spicy Charred Octopus bowl, again it was incredibly salty. I couldn't differentiate between the Fiery Dan Dan flavor from my first visit and the flavor of the spicy charred octopus. The thing that sends me over the edge is that their noodle dishes are TWICE as expensive as Tea House Noodle which is right down the street and very tasty. If you are looking for a noodle place skip this joint and go to Tea House Noodle; your wallet and your tastebuds will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I was excited to give Noodlecat a try as Greenhouse Tavern is one of my favorite restaurants.  In the end, i was kinda disappointed with it. I'll start with the interior which while trying to be industrial chic, it makes Chipotle look trendy. The stools are uncomfortable so you probably won't wanna hang around and linger here for long.  Note to self- Remember to bring a donut seat cushion next time.  Next we get to the drinks. There is no Coke or Pepsi here, just Fever Tree and Grown Up Soda plus teas, beer, sake, etc. My friend ordered a Coke without being told that Coke isn't available.  He ended up with a GUS Cola which tastes like a flat Coca-Cola. I do like some of the GUS drinks as I've had them before but the Cola isn't very good and the waitress should've mentioned that this was available instead of Coke. Even worse is the exorbitant prices for GUS. $4 for a small bottle is a little crazy as it's around $1.50 to $2 at your local grocery store. The Fever Tree drinks were interesting.  The waitress mixed up our drinks and the Ginger Ale and Ginger Beer went to the wrong people at the table.  The beer was the strongest I've ever tasted but it wasn't a bad thing and i'd probably try it again although I actually ordered the ale.  Now to the food and I have to say that Noodlecat's take on Matzo ball soup was terrific.  There's nothing noodle house or Jewish deli authentic about it but it was awesome. I thought the portion was a good size and three out of four diners at our table took home leftovers (or maybe we just wanted to get off those stools!) While I didn't taste any of my friends or my wife's meals, they didn't seem to enjoy it as much as mine.  Next time I think I'll try an appetizer and a salad and see how they do in those departments.  The Matzo dish was really the saving grace about Noodlecat as I don't think I'd be so generous in my rating if it wasn't for how tasty that dish was.  My biggest issue, besides the chairs, were the prices. Most noodle houses are relatively affordable but charging $15 for a take on Matzo ball soup is out of line even if it is good. Almost all of the noodle dishes start at over $10 for dinner which is way too much. Instead of being a neighborhood noodle bar, which is what it was supposedly envisioned to be, this is almost a special occasion restaurant because of the high prices. If you want an actual neighborhood noodle house, go down to Teahouse Noodles where you can actually get a meal for under $10.  For how much the Sawyers are charging you to slurp noodles, you can practically go down the street to their GHT and have a better meal in a better atmosphere. And the best part of that is you don't have to sit on those darn stools!"}
{"text":"Hands down best steambuns I've had on my travels.  I dream about these from time to time and they have consistently been good on the 5 or 6 occasions I've been in town to visit Noodlecat.  This time I had the Clam Chowder Ramen to supplement my steam bun fix and was left wanting to lick the bowl.  The other noodle dishes I've had have always been satisfying and full of flavor.  Yum.  5 stars because I've now been there at least 5 or 6 times and each time I visit I leave wanting to go again ASAP.  My favorite restaurant that isn't local to my hometown.  Ready for next time :)"}
{"text":"Hate to write this, but after having several subpar experiences, I felt it was time for some constructive criticism.  I will start off by saying that I have, on occasion, had great food here. The services has always been an issue and you need to be prepared an hour + lunch.  This is not a quick bite to eat place. To overcome this, I started to order take out.  The inconsistency with the quality, as well as quantity,  of my favorite meal (Brussel Sprouts salad), drives to me to this review.  On several instances (both sit down and take out), what originally started out as a large bowl of shredded green cabbage with mounds of crispy, wasabi grilled brussel sprouts, is now offered at what I would easily say is 1/2  or less of the original serving  and now contains more broccoli than sprouts. Check out the menu, Broccoli is never mentioned as a menu item. The marinated vegetables are now quite Soy Sauce heavy resulting in a very salty meal.  During one of my onsite visits, after questioning the meal presented, the manager came across as confrontational and challenged my concern.  I LOVED this when you first opened but now.....I'll deconstruct the recipe and make it home."}
{"text":"Good flavor, but sorry, noodles and a very small helping of roasted pork is not worth $14."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about Noodlecat for awhile and figured a cold day this past weekend would be the perfect time to grab some comfort food in the form of Japanese noodles.    The vibe of Noodlecat was pretty rad - it's a bit cozy dinner, a little dive, and a little contemporary.  It definitely put us in the mood to get our grub on and we were super excited to dig into this menu.  Here's the breakdown of the order:  Spicy Tofu Udon Tempura Soba Dori & half Japanese Cobb Salad Takahachi Ramen Tonkatsu and Tempura Veggie Steam Buns Tempura Veggie Plate Tsukemono Pickle Sampler  I know - quite a bit of food, but it was dinner with my mom and brother and we wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Try everything we did, love everything we did not.  I found the cobb salad to be very bland.  Not a lot of flavor, a lot of leafy-taste (Hey, I LOVE me a good salad and veggies but this was like eating grass), and I barely got through half of it.  We then received our Tsukemono Pickle Sampler and that didn't go over too well with my mom, mainly because she can't stand HOT food and this is HOT (which they don't mention on the menu).  The Tempura Veggie Platter was AMAZING and definitely my favorite plate of the meal.  As for the noodle dishes, mine was WAY TOO salty - I'm Japanese and put soy sauce on EVERYTHING (don't judge!) and my mouth couldn't handle it.  I took the leftovers home for my bf and I to split for breakfast the next morning and the saltiness was even worse.  My mom and brother seemed to enjoy their dishes but didn't say much.  The buns weren't bad - the tonkatsu bun was pretty great, but I don't find myself feeling the desire to order them again the next time I dine at Noodlecat.  Maybe I'm a little biased - I did grow up with a Japanese grandmother who was raised in Japan, I have been eating home cooked, family recipe Japanese meals my entire life, and I lived in Japan for 3 months at one point in my life.  Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe it was an off night, but I wasn't blown away with Noodlecat.  If you happen to be in the area and are in the mood for Japanese-style noodles and plates, then I would say give this place a shot - you may really love it.  I'm not giving up on Noodlecat and hope my next visit succeeds my first."}
{"text":"great food had the Chilled Mori Soba, left unsatisfied with portions and pricing"}
{"text":"Even though I come here if I'm craving ramen, I would not recommend this place.  Noodlecat is consistently inconsistent. One day the will be on point and your ramen will be piping hot and delicious. The next it will be so lukewarm they would hardly cook your vegetables. The same goes for there other dishes, like the brussel sprouts which on a  good day with be crispy and perfectly spiced and on another day be overdone, charred, with not a hint of green anywhere. I take the hit because it's walking distance from our place."}
{"text":"Almost didn't come here because of the 3-star average Yelp rating.  Glad that my wife convinced me to form my own opinion.  This is certainly not a 3-star restaurant, and it seems like many of those giving it 1 or 2 stars are dinging Noodlecat for not living up to their personal vision of what a ramen place should be based on their experiences in other glorious metropolises.  (I ate at plenty of noodle places when I lived in NYC, and I was somehow able to not turn my Noodlecat experience into an exercise in comparative eating.)  Food should stand on its own -- it's either good or it's not.  If you're downgrading Noodlecat because you thought the food was genuinely bad, then so be it -- but criticizing the style of bowl that the ramen is served in?  Get over yourself.  Loved my Pork Miso Ramen.  The pulled pork was cooked absolutely perfectly.  The noodles and broth were great.  Also very impressed with the dishes my wife ordered.  I was completely satisfied, and can't wait to come back when it gets cold out.    I didn't feel like the food was overpriced.  If you think it was, go eat at Zinc Bistro and then report back to me.  Bonus points for the excellent, extremely courteous service.  4 stars for now, since I'd like to sample a lot more of the dishes before I render a final verdict.  But I'm putting a review in now to help offset the absurd 3-star rating.  It would be a damn shame if Noodlecat went under -- Cleveland benefits greatly from having a place like this."}
{"text":"If you're missing a college ramen noodle fix, this is the place to go.  The menu has a range of variations to pick from that you couldn't work up in your dorm room.  The tempura was special.  That's where it stops.  The broth was bland with no taste. For a place calling itself Noodlecat there are only a couple dishes that have anything but ramen noodles.  The prices were high ($9-14) for a meal with less than a $1 worth of noodles and little else.  The decor is a dismal gray.  The seats are industrial with no backs (wear your coat or put it on the floor) and no hooks except by the door.  Three of us, from college to retired, agreed.  Ok, so maybe some like that Spartan decor.  At these prices for a restaurant with a major chef, the food and scene should sing to you.  Sorry, we really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Definitely no where near the quality of a ramen house. This is food court quality. Way over priced. Same price as 5 star sit down ramen  restaurants but not the same complexity, didication, broths, flavor, or experience. Sad that this is all that is offered on the Westside. We had the fried chicken ramen and the tofu ramen. Meals were served in the same kind of paper carton that you would get a sundae served in at a road side ice cream place. They should do like Panera and offer better plates/bowls and utensils. The sitting area was cramped and uninviting."}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about this place. The atmosphere and décor is casual, unique and inviting. I thought the service was great and the prices are about what I would expect for a $$ rating. My selections from the menu were a hit and a miss. The steam buns were really good. Three or four steam buns would have been a memorable meal. I had a spicy pork short rib that was served on the side and it was also very good. My main dish, a large bowl of noodles with a broth, wasn't something I would order again. To be fair, I am not familiar with Japanese cuisine. The noodle dishes may be great examples of this style of cooking, but the one I chose was more of a soup than a main course. It was just a little too salty and not filling enough for my preferences.  With additional experience ordering from the menu, I am confident I could narrow the choices down to items that would be a better fit and a better experience for me."}
{"text":"When I first went to this place shortly after they opened I was seriously impressed and glad that Cleveland finally had a great noodle joint.  The pork miso and the steam buns were fantastic and delicious. But unfortunately as the months went on, the food quality started to become inconsistent.  Sometimes it was pretty good, other times not so much.  I wanted to keep loving this place but I never know what kind of food I'm going to end up with.  I keep going back every few months to see if things have changed, and once things become consistent again I'll be happy to update my review."}
{"text":"Noodlecat is, in my opinion, a solid restaurant, and one that deserves four stars. To start with, I'm a big fan of anything that makes downtown Cleveland feel contemporary and lived-in, and this does that, so I'm predisposed to like it. When the people at Noodlecat provide that, plus quick service and cool design, not to mention tasty food, it deserves four stars - and five down the road, if I continue to have good experiences there.   At between $10-20/meal, I won't be coming here every night on my student budget, but for the quality of the food I got, I didn't begrudge them the prices, nor did I feel like I got a small portion for my money. After a bowl of noodles and a bun, I was full - and I'm a 6'4\" guy with a love for eating that at times may border on the fanatical. My portion of Hokkaido noodles were delicious and well-seasoned, and unlike other reviewers previously, I found that it wasn't overly salty. The BBQ Pulled Pork steam bun was delicious, and more than anything I was sad that I'd only ordered one.  Full disclosure: I'm not a ramen connoisseur. I don't generally hunt down ramen places in other cities to compare them to Noodlecat, and I haven't been to Japan to taste 'the real deal'. I didn't come here looking for 'authentic ramen just like the REAL Japanese make it'. However, I'm proud to say that I've been eating food practically my whole life, and speaking as an objective party I'll tell you that the food served here is delicious. I'll be coming back, and if you're thinking of going to Noodlecat but were given pause by its three star average on Yelp, let me advise you: Go. Take a crazy leap of faith, and go decide for yourself whether you like it. At worst you'll get a meal that you aren't wild about, but at best you'll find your new favourite food spot downtown, which just happens to provide food found nowhere else in Cleveland and is damn tasty to boot."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here a long time ago because it is a noodle shop. My fiance's friend (quite the foody, and keen on Asian food) had tried it a few times and said it wasn't worth the time becuse the broth was very salty. All the yelp reviews tended to echo the same thing. ... But I was stubborn, and I wanted to go.   So we did. And guess what, the soup portion was not even editable because it was so salty... and beyond that I got rice balls that were clearly refrigerated and reheated in the microwave (cold in the middle. yuck). We vowed never to go again.   Well I felt like going yesterday, mostly because I was craving salt, and I secretly wanted to try it again. ... The menu was different, and our food wasn't as terrible. I enjoyed my noodles but they didn't wow me to any extent. I know my fiance did enjoy his variety of bun sandwiches. While I didn't like the combinations of the ones we tried, I am really curious to try a few more of them!   My over all feeling is... its good. Not great, and not bad. We'll probably eat here again one day... maybe? . I feel like we are more likely to hit up the WSM one to try some more bun sandwiches (and probably no more noodle bowls)."}
{"text":"I am grateful Noodlecat exists here in downtown Cleveland.  I love ALL the buns, and the Kimchi salad is great. The Kale \"super\" salad's dressing is questionable but otherwise an amazing and healthy dish, and the Japanese Cobb salad also could use a different dressing.   As an Asian person I guess I do find the noodles to be a bit disappointing, And the Beef short ribs are too crisp and way too sweet for my taste.  Noodle wise I do think the Spicy Octopus Udon is their best."}
{"text":"I want to say first that I was so excited to try this place.  My friends have gone and liked it and the pics they post on their FB page look delicious.  That being said, I was really disappointed with the food.  I ordered the vegetarian special when I was there, which was a soba noodle salad.  This being a noodle salad and not a noodle bowl, I knew it wouldn't have as much broth, but this salad was DRY.  It also didn't have much of a taste.  I had to pour hot sauce and soy sauce on it to give it some texture and taste, which is no good.    Thinking maybe it was just my meal, I tried my companion's meal, which was the ramen dish with chicken.  This dish is a staple on the menu, so they should be able to make it right.  However, it had almost no taste, was very bland.    The only good thing was the quickness of our service.  But all in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I love Japanese style noodles, all sorts, but this place left me extremely disappointed.   Ok, so I had lunch with a friend. We each ordered an appetizer (egg salad and fried veggie cakes). The egg salad was tiny and rather bland, while the veggie cakes were great, although a bit oversalted.   Then our noodles came. It was a special, so it was $15 for the noodles, which seemed pretty pricey for lunch but I really wanted this dish. Braised potato, mussels, shrimp with black garlic bread. Yum! Wait, no, it wasn't. The noodles were good as were all of the other items in the dish, except for the most important part, the broth. The broth was so salty, like salt water. The only way that I was able to eat the soup was to add water from my iced water into the soup to thin it out and try not to drink any of said broth. A horrible, disgusting mess of noodles.   This is supposed to be a nice place to eat great food. Authentic and new flavors. I would think that someone who works at a place like this would know how to season food.   And don't get me started on the ridiculously overpriced tea pots....it's no better than the genmai cha packets you can buy for $2/box."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Cleveland and ate here last week.  We sat at the bar.  Quick service, nice staff, casual and nice decor.  The food was awesome!  and cheap.  $6 for dinner, really?  loved it and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Jon is one of the best servers we've ever had. He seemed to really enjoy explaining the food in detail and also had excellent advice on dishes. Food was amazing! We travel all over the country constantly, and this was some of the best!"}
{"text":"I eat Noodle Cat at least twice a week. And \"at least\" is an understatement. From day one, I have been wowed over and over by this place. The staff are extremely friendly, the music is great, and the food never fails to keep me satisfied and excited for the next time I get to place an order! And as a college student, I am totally happy to pay six bucks for a satisfying half order of noodles, not including awesome happy hour specials.  I am a religious noodle orderer. My favorites being the Short Rib Ramen and the Clam Chowder Udon. That being said, Noodle Cat always blows me away with their daily specials! Just when I think they've outdone themselves, along comes another brilliant flavor combination posted daily to the restaurant website.  When I don't order noodles to-go for lunch and instead drag a friend with me for dinner in the hopes of converting them too, the pork chop entree with kimchee apples and fried sticky rice is amazing. And friends are continuously, and pleasantly, surprised with how simply but delicious the menu options are here.   Such a huge fan of Noodle Cat's attitude of loyalty to green and local products! Like their delicious house infused sake creations.   All the more reason to support a Cleveland food establishment like this one.   (I swear I don't work here...though I've considered asking whether or not they have any openings since I already have the menu memorized.)"}
{"text":"WAY over priced and tasteless!  We visited for lunch in mid June and I had the Dan Dan Ramen and my companion had the Fried chicken ramen.  The Dan Dan was so over spiced that it was inedible.  No flavor other than heat; I like spicy foods but this was not palatable.  The fried chicken ramen was water with gummy noodles floating n it.  The side piece of fired chicken was mushy and flavorless also.  The meal cost over $30 and was not even up to a grocery store dried Ramen packet that costs less than $1."}
{"text":"Noodles galore and steamy buns.  Great place to experience Mr Sawyer's vision of Pacific Rim cuisine nestled in cute white bowls.  Veggie friendly to boot!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in what I experienced at Noodlecat. Simply said, the food was flavorless. It was such a strange feeling to eat food that looked yummy and tasted like absolutely nothing. Even cheap ramen is at least salty!  Not even the little dumpling buns saved my meal. I am so sorry to not be able to say anything positive. I have eaten at similar restaurants in other cities and been happy, this is just not hitting the mark. :("}
{"text":"Noodlecat is a great concept and something Cleveland needs more of. Chef-driven, casual food and a cuisine outside the comfort zone of pirogies and grilled cheese.    However, execution here is needs work.   Ordered two bowls of noodles: one Ramen, the other udon. In addition, three buns.   The broth for the noodles wasn't hot enough, and as my brother noted, lacked depth. What they lacked in depth and simmer-time, resulted in an overload of sodium. The ramen as well, not the house made ones (those are difficult to make even in he best ramen shops) but the ones manufactured in Nee Jersey, lacked alkaline and the right proportions to make them delightfully chewy and springy as ramen noodles should be. They had a consistency of spaghetti. The pork in mine was also chewy to the point of being inedible. Did not finish more than 1/3rd of mine.   The buns were a bit pedestrian as well-- saturated with spicy mayo or hoisin, and came in been-there-done-that combinations. The buns themselves I don't think we're well executed either, as they were not as pillowy and freshly steamed as buns should be.   Again, loved the concept-- ticking boxes off on paper menus to be submitted to the staff. The decor is nice and comfortable, albeit a bit grimy given the stickiness of the tables.   Overall, go to Noodlecat because you want to support local business and try it out. Cleveland doesn't really have any other ramen bar, right? Don't go if you're familiar and KNOW West Coast, NYC and actual ramen from Japan.   Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dear Noodle Cat,  I had such high hopes for you. Such high hopes that I kept coming back with the hope that perhaps that last time I went was a fluke. But no. This time, it was the donabe. The miso overwhelmed the entire dish. It tasted like I was drinking liquid salt. Perhaps the bland vegetables exacerbated the whole affair (zucchini--in your case very over boiled zucchini-- in miso soup is never a palatable option, in my opinion). The way your vinegar infused rice (really? I can barely stand it in maki-zushi and now I have to deal with a whole un-adorned mound on my plate?) is crammed ever so indelicately into a yunomi really didn't help the situation.  The tofu-coconut-veggie-curry...or was that spicey water? And the eggplant nasu miso, a favorite Japanese dish of mine, was utterly ruined by overcooked rice, and a very sub-par combination of miso and very badly done mushroom.   One positive thing: your steamed buns are to die for. Every time I've had them, they've been delicious. The buns soft, chewy, the inside meat/tofu beautifully done. The display wonderful. Perhaps you should just stick to your steamed buns.   Some people like your place because it's \"cheap\". I'm not sure if I agree with this comment, as there are plenty of \"cheap\" establishments around with higher ranking taste.   I'm sorry to do this, noodlecat, but you've frustrated me so much, I needed to write something."}
{"text":"Can't believe all the reviews saying that the food is subpar - it was fabulous!  Love that there is a separate vegan menu! I had the Dan Dan Ramen and added a veggie cake (ommgggg so delicious).  My husband had the vegan tempura soba dori -- he's a picky eater and loved it! Unfortunately the only thing keeping this from a five star rating (actually made me want to give even less) was the abysmal service. Hope our server was just having a really \"off\" night - we saw her when we sat down and when she dropped the check off - I had to refill my own drinks at the bar and the manager took and ran our card. We left full and happy, but only because the noodles were so yummy."}
{"text":"It's a good place for a noodle fix, which my hungover belly had in a bad way. The menu fare is interesting, service was nice (if not a little hipster elitist), but the lighting was awful! I came in for a Saturday lunch and the place was incredibly dark. No biggie, though. It was bright enough for my pork miso ramen. Hot sauce at the table was a good touch too."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a Cavs game with some friends and we decided to order takeout from Noodlecat.They completely ruined our order only getting one of the orders right. The order that was right was absolutely terrible, the rice with chicken bowl tasted like chicken rice soup from the local chineese joint except it tasted as if it was stirred unwashed hobo foot. To make things worse the chicken rice bowl was ten dollars and  was made with the quality of a dollar menu item. I considered calling to straighten things out but decided it was not worth it all. Wouldn't not recommend to my worst enemy.  0/10"}
{"text":"Our group to this restaurant and order different type of food. Three of us ordered house made ramen and it turn out that this ramen noodle was very bad and not edible for us. On the bright side, after complained, they gave us some discount. In addition, only two out of 8 dishes are considered good. The rest are either bad or OK. Overall service is good despite of food quality."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a quick but delicious meal after a movie or an afternoon of shopping. Inexpensive but very good food in a clean and comfortable space. We tried the miso pork and fried chicken ramen. Both were tasty and filling!  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The most salty miso noodles I have ever tried. The service was awful, no smiles or greetings. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Have always disliked this place, even when it was downtown. The oil makes you sick. The menu is just too weird."}
{"text":"prices were a little high. I bought our group lunch and was surprised how high it was for only 3 of us however, the wings and food in general were unreal. I dont get the bad reviews it was really really good everyone enjoyed it! I want to go back and try some actual noodle dishes but I didnt get the chance to. I also got a salad with their ginger dressing and it was very good. Highly recommened. Sort of craving it right now actually while im typing!!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"How this place won Best of Cleveland's New Restaurant is beyond me.  I have been here at least 4 times hoping that the staff and food would get better each time and boy, was I wroooongggggg. The last and FINAL trip I made to Noodlecat was a few months ago. I went in with an open mind because my previous experiences were horrid. We were \"welcomed\" if you want to call it that by a waitress who could give a shit less about her customers and you could tell because she didn't make any eye contact. She then continued to banter on about how much she \"knew\" about the menu and informed us of the specials. When we decided to order she couldn't be found for about 10 minutes because she was in the kitchen. I decided to order the special that they had going and when it arrived to me, not only was it unappealing but it had no flavor. I decided to let our waitress know that I wasn't happy and she told me that the \"chef\" would be happy to prepare something different for me. The \"chef\" then came out wearing ripped jeans and a bandanna around his head. He asked what I didn't like about the dish and I told him that it had no flavor only heat. He said well I make a really good stir- fry with octopus, are you interested? I thought hell, it can't get much worse so sure. He brought the new dish out and it looked pretty good, thanked the chef for being so kind and dug in. Again, this dish had no flavor at all and was just enough to make me never come back, until I got the bill. I work in a customer service related field where if you mess up you don't charge the customer. NoodlCat charged me 25.00 for the dish that the chef made for me!! 25.00 for a dish that was worse than the previous. I paid my bill and left and decided to never return. The staff thinks they are smarter than you because they know about Saki and Vietnamese street food. Maybe, they should learn a bit of customer service."}
{"text":"I look at quality, quantity & price. Quality: It tasted like it was microwave food. I would put a label of fast food on this place. Quantity: I received about four pieces of tofu in a \"full\" serving. Price: I could have gone to Saigon instead. Saigon is pricey, but they make your food to order. You can go to the counter next to Charley's in the Old Arcade and get a similar meal, but much cheaper."}
{"text":"I don't know what's so special about this restaurant?... Was not satisfied the first time!! Thought i would give it another shot, still felt disappointed! Most likely won't come back again...."}
{"text":"Don't you dare make a comment at this place! Manager will jump you! Or maybe the employee I watched sneaking bourbon shots will.   I travel 3 days a week, eat out all the time with my family and in my 43 years living have I never been treated this way at a restaurant.  Looked good, menu was different and looked great, apps were good, bartender was very nice and she made an honest mistake. She was very helpful and I took her recs but she or the kitchen brought my wrong food (which happens). Then she never followed up to get my correct order so after 25 minutes of watching her run around taking orders and dealing with carryout with no help, I asked and she forgot to put the re-order in. This too happens.   Then enter Julie at the bar.... When I asked what happened and why this Julie said \"are you done with your rant?\"  Excuse me?? She adds \"relax, we are getting your food and she made a mistake\" I realize this and would have gladly ate the entree and tipped the bartender if it wasnt her fault. When I asked for the manager Julie walked over in a very smart ass fashion and said \"I am the manager, how can I help you?\" Are you serious?? How can the owner have someone like that running their biz?  Thankfully a homeless man (at least I can assume) walked up to the bar and I gave him my entree that they brought after 50 minutes of waiting. I hope he enjoyed his hot free meal.   Back to the guy I saw taking shots, now it all makes sense. This place has great potential but like most things, about how you are treated."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food, great price. I came on the recommendation of a friend and it didn't disappoint. Adrian was my server and she was wonderful. She was upbeat and attentive and helped me figure out how to order. I had the crispy beef short ribs and it was delicious. Next time I come through Cleveland I will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for a few years, I have tasted what I consider \"authentic\" ramen. When I moved to CLE, noodles were one of the things I missed the most. I was happily surprised, then, to heard of a ramen-ya (ramen shop) opening downtown. Boy was I disappointed. Noodlecat is to ramen what Sushirock in Cleveland is to the world-famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo-- a sad facsimile. The broth was off for both the Shoyu and Miso flavors, the noodles had a texture best described as \"unique\", and the buns we ordered as a side had an interesting filling-on-top conformation. None of this was a good thing.  As a fan of more \"authentic\" style ramen, I can say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch and was not disappointed.  Great vibe and friendly service.  Food overall was very good.  Had the spicy octopus udon and the kim chi. Noodles were in a rich, spicy broth with fresh veggies.  Delicious, salty spiciness.  Good portions and fair prices.  Others at the table were loving the steam buns. Will look forward to going back when in town."}
{"text":"Good things -   Noodle Cat is a cheap date.  You can be in and out of here with a $40 tab for two people, including a drink.  Definitely aim for happy hour if you can, then we're talking 30 bucks, seriously. The steamed buns are absolutely adorable, definitely all they're cracked up to be - I've started all 4 visits with a couple of them (My fav is the brisket bun).  The most memorable dish that I've gotten is the Spicy Octopus Udon Stir Fry. When it was good it was really good, when it was bad, it was a Lean Cuisine.   Could improve on things -   Do you remember those uncomfortable, narrow steel stools that you sat on in drawing 101? Well get ready to be uncomfortable for your entire meal, because, besides an even more uncomfortable (bizarrely uncomfortable) bench in the back, and some bar chairs, these are what you'll be sitting on.  Teetering on the world's crappiest seat for an hour (or less cause I usually wanna get off my perch and go somewhere else) kills. me.  Also, there is little consistency with the food.  Yes, 13 dollars is cheap for an entree.  No, not cheap enough that I don't mind sometimes getting something decent, and sometimes getting watery take-out.   Also also, the ambiance is beyond underwhelming. DEFINITELY don't go here with a date.  It will be awkward.   If you're dying for cheap noodles and you don't care about dining experience, give this place a try. If not, don't."}
{"text":"Had a very strange experience  there. Food was good, but was very long coming out. Forgot an item of our order . Not to their fault, had a homeless man come in to sell flowers  and an argument ensued.  My daughter  was loving the food, but had a bowl of broth spilled on her. It ruin ed her uggs and clothes.  They told us to call  them, but being from pittsburgh  what can we do. The worst thing was my daughter  was in town for a cheer competition.  We came home and within  20 min she was in the bathroom  sick. Place seems dirty. Manager was nice but  still doesn't help me with with my sick child."}
{"text":"It's a very nice noodle place. I like it a lot and used to go often to the downtown location. It a great alternative to the typical corporate places."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat for either lunch or dinner! I have never been here when it was crowded, but the service is good. Food is reasonably priced. I have only tried the clam chowder ramen as it is the most appealing to me on the menu and I know it is delicious! The flavor is so good. The tempura vegetables are also delicious, but they must have changed their menu recently because it was different since the last time I ordered it. The tempura vegetables are still yummy, but they do not have the variety, such as it used to include sweet potatoes and mushrooms. My favorite tea is the lemon berry, but they have not had it for at least half of my visits, which is disappointing because it was so good! The servers recommend a similar tea, which is good but not the same."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of NoodleCat but since their recent changes I am no longer a fan. Their menu has sized down significantly as well as the servings. They only offer 5 different types of buns and their build your own noodle bowls. They used to have more buns and many appetizers which are now no longer on the menu. Their bar selection has also shrunk down which, admittedly, wasn't too large to start with. I ordered some buns while at my last visit and was very disappointed with the amount served. I ordered a veggie tempura one and honestly got a piece of broccoli and a slice of zucchini on the inside... the fish bun had maybe a couple shreds that I couldn't even tell was fish when all I tasted was batter. Overall I will not be stopping at Noodlecat again."}
{"text":"Having been to the former downtown location, I can see why ramen snobs will be disappointed with the fast casual concept at Crocker, but I found the noodle bowls despite the limited selection to be good and flavorful.  The noodles had the right chewy consistency and the miso broth, which is all they have,  tasted great, not too salty, not too creamy.  The pulled pork wasn't as fancy as  traditional pork belly, and the fried chicken leg was rather small.  Ramen toppings like corn,  bamboo shoots, wood ears and nori were nonexistent.  While it's true that the prices were on the high side for what you get, the location is Crocker and everything there is expensive."}
{"text":"Great noodles and broth and the buns were so tasty. I hadn't eaten buns like this, but they are somewhat like pork buns. Know that the portions are large. I dislike highly spiced food and this was getting borderline for me, but I handled. I was sorry they didn't have t-shirts for sale, would have made great gifts, THE Noodlecat logo is so cute."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this review.  The first time I went to Noodlecat was a few years ago, when they had just opened.  I had a wonderful 5-star experience.  The second time I went to Noodlecat was last week, and it was much different.  I give it 3 stars based on this recent experience, but I'm giving it 4 stars overall as an average of the two visits I've had.  I did not find it a warm, inviting establishment.  The service was average.  I ordered the Dan Dan Ramen- it was pretty good, but I was expecting it to be in a broth.  This was my fault, as \"broth\" was not mentioned in the description- I had just assumed it since it was under the \"Ramen\" section.  I didn't find it to be a superb value, but they do offer a happy hour with some good specials- I'll try to make that next time- and there will be a next time, because I think I caught them on an off-night."}
{"text":"Stopped by because of all the hype. This place was awful. We had the octopus and curry. Both were so spicy you could barely taste the flavors of the ingredients.  The steamed buns were tasty but extremely overpriced. Pretty much got my lips burned off and paid for it."}
{"text":"I should have read the other reviews beforehand as the college ramen is incredibly bland and the noodles were actually quite chewy despite the menu description trying to convince you otherwise.  The buns were decent however at their regular price and portion size the numbers just don't add up for what you get.  The food came out relatively quickly despite the inattentive waitress (the place was dead when we first arrived however she seemed to disappear for random stretches of time and never offered any refills or checks after the food was delivered).  I would rate the chain restaurant noodles and company 5 stars compared to this place."}
{"text":"Came in today, ordered the pork miso at Emily's recommendation. The service was great and all of the employees-very nice and courteous!"}
{"text":"Was there at 1030pm for supper.  I felt as if either I was invisible or waiters was already in going-home mood (they close at 11pm), and I was not entertained.  So I decided to get take out that time. The ramen is not authentic and lack of taste other than saltiness.  Went back again for lunch this time to give them another chance the next day.  This time I ordered dan dan ramen and kimchi salad, finish with a friend chicken bun.  The noodle was tasty but quite plain with peanuts, garnish, and dry sauce.  Salad was really good I have to say.  The bun was average, again lack of taste but quite salty.  Overall, if you are looking for cheap food and quick lunch/supper, this place is adequate, but don't expect authentic food or great service."}
{"text":"This place thoroughly met what my expectations should have been. Having lived in Japan for a couple years in the past, I knew just what I wanted for lunch on a cold day like today. Ramen. I did a search and found this place just a block or so from the hotel. The pictures of the ramen had me heading out the door as soon as I saw them. Unfortunately, the Pork Miso Ramen wasn't quite what I had in mind, not really much flavor on its own. From an American Ramen chain, however, it was still pretty good, I had simply hoped for much more! The staff was excellent and very friendly. If youve eaten real ramen before, I'd recommend somewhere else, otherwise, this place should do the trick!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Noodlecat nearly weekly since it opened.   It has an incredible mix of Tokyo/NYC style ramen bowls and Americanized Japanese steam bun sandwiches: - melt in your mouth pulled pork - crunchy fried chicken - fried freshwater fish  The staff is friendly and attentive, with the kitchen serving your food much faster than you'd expect.  The happy hour is valid at the bar or patio and makes an already affordable menu cheaper. Drink specials are on Sake, draft beer and well drinks."}
{"text":"If the book Stuff White People Like could have created a restaurant Noodlecat would be it. It's pretentious, overpriced, and blander than a motherf@cker. I have given this place three tries and have been disappointed every time despite ordering different things. Considering Asia Plaza is less than ten minutes away go somewhere there and enjoy flavorful ethnic food."}
{"text":"So sad to see Old Noodle Cat go. The location on Euclid was my second home. The new place is not the same. Portions are smaller, recipes are different, atmosphere is nothing like it used to be. I complained a while back, they said they would get back to you and then ignore the issue. They also deleted their Facebook reviews after a lot of people complained. If you comment on their photos questioning the honesty, they will just delete the bad comments and block you. Guess they lack customer service."}
{"text":"Mmmm. While I've had better ramen and udon elsewhere, Noodlecat has never disappointed. Pork belly ramen seems to be a thing these days, and Noodlecat's is a fine example. Baby octopus udon stir fry is pretty spicy, but the octopus is cooked well (not rubbery at all), and is in a sesame based sauce with chili oil. Yum.  Steam buns are also a good choice. The pork was good, but the one with fish wasn't so great.  Interesting sake and beer selection. Staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Not going back. We couldn't wait to try this new spot at Crocker Park. It was impressive that the place was full at 2:00 pm. Portions were small for what you pay for. Bubble tea was expensive. Staff Chad a hard time staying on track with orders and maintaining a clean dining area."}
{"text":"First trip here. Happy hour, Date at the bar.  The steam buns were 2 for $5.   I thought the pulled pork and fried chicken stood out.  Noodle 1/2 portions were $5.  I'm no expert on ramen but I thought it was pretty delicious.  I don't care how authentic it is and quite frankly I wouldn't know.  Service was good. Atmosphere was dark and subdued but I was feeling it.  Great value. We'll be back"}
{"text":"NoodleCat is close to the top of my list of favorite CLE restaurants, if it's not number one.  I haven't actually created a list because that's too much of a commitment for me.  I try to get something other than the Spicy Octopus Udon when I go, but I can't.  I have done it, but I'm not too proud to order the same thing over, and over, and over again.  It's so good.  When I think of NoodleCat, I associate those flavors with it - the spicy chili sauce (you can tell it's made fresh because sometimes it's spicier than others), the crunch of the veggies (carrots and peppers), the tender, juicy octopus, the nutty sesame seeds and the fresh burst of cilantro.  It's almost too good to be true, but it is.  Spicy Octopus Udon is always there for me.  Then there are the steam buns.  I love that they are available based on the season.  Right now, they have this AMAZING crispy onion steam bun.  It sounds kind of like an onion ring sandwich, until you realize that were' talkin golden-fried green onions.  It's so good.  But the tempura-fried fish steam buns are delicious, always.  Their pickle bun is refreshing and satisfying.  The heirloom tomato steam bun that they've offered in the summer is really delicious too.  It's also worth noting that I don't eat meat, but my fiance RAVES about their fried chicken, burger, pork, and any other steam bun that he's had, that I haven't.  Seriously, if you live in, or have been, will be, or needed a reason to be in Cleveland, find NoodleCat, and you won't be disappointed...unless you don't enjoy restaurants with a relaxed vibe and extremely flavorful food AND delicious, one-of-a-kind drinks.  NoodleCat rocks!"}
{"text":"Great concept!  Noodlecat is almost always a guaranteed stop when I'm in Cleveland!  So good that I try to take friends there!  Steam buns are interesting the first time you try them... and completely addicting from then on!  Try the Japanese Fried Chicken steam bun, that comes with a little bit of maple and some sriracha kick!  The Pork Miso Ramen is my favorite.  Crispy Beef Shortrib is really good also."}
{"text":"Ever since I've been to Ohio, I've always had to stop by Noodle Cat. We ran into it a couple years ago when visiting the west side market but found out this year that they have recently shut down. The restaurant is a cute little hipster place and pretty cozy inside almost like a lounge. You can come in with your laptop and hang out. They have a nice selection of Ramen. We got the pork miso Ramen, the special (which was the yellow curly noodles with brisket and mushrooms), the spicy octopus Ramen, Brussel sprouts, and Kim chi salad. The Kim chi salad was different than what I expected, it was not fermented cabbage but it was fresh cabbage with other veggies, it was good but the flavor was a little too intense for a salad. All of the Ramen was really good all with a great flavor of its own. The miso pork Ramen was delicious and savory with a 6 minute egg which was cooked perfectly. The special had the brisket and mushroom in it which went really well with each other and the noodles were the best part. The spicy octopus Ramen was really great also. There was no broth but it was nice and spicy with lots of flavor and the octopus was extremely tender and fresh! Definitely a must try. The restaurant was nice and decently clean but the bathrooms smelled pretty bad so don't be surprised. All in all, we love eating there and will always be regulars."}
{"text":"Kevin,   Me and my HOT girlfriend(Tamara) arrived to NodeCat at 7:40. We were immediately greeted by TALL MAN dark hair decent looking. He IMMEDIATELY told Us WE are closed. BUT IT WAS 8:00 P.M.  So you are tellin me you're closed before 8:00Prime Minister. Are you nuts you dang stunken dingus?   I love this restaurant I wanted a stunken noodle. Why you dang close   Whoa, boys   - Kevi"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a number of months now and there's a good reason I keep coming back. The food is great, atmosphere is chill and relaxing without putting me to sleep, and the staff is super friendly and efficient.  I'd especially recommend sitting at the bar if you're there during the day on a weekday--the bartender Adrien is one of the best parts of this place.   Favorites include the clam chowder ramen, the buttermilk chicken ramen, and the short rib ramen. And the steam buns are a MUST."}
{"text":"Have at it if you are ready to have a heart attach. Very very very salty. Couldn't finish my meal..."}
{"text":"The service has really gone down hill. I attempted to eat here before a Cavs game about a month ago and the service was so terrible that we got up and left. I decided to try again. This time my boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar. While we had better service the bartender seemed a bit cold and not too attentive. I used to love Noodlecat. The wait staff always made great suggestions of menu items to try or how to amp up a dish by simply adding an egg to something. I love all of Jonathan Sawyers restaurants and I am wondering if he is letting this one fall through the cracks.  The food on my most recent trip was just okay. I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Ramen and while the chicken was delicious the noodles were chewy. I could not even bare to finish mine and I ordered the half size. My boyfriend was much luckier with his pick, the short rib ramen. The short rib was spot on and the flavor of the ramen was great. I will say despite my terrible experiences lately with Noodlecat that the Okonomi Yaki is still my favorite- and yes, add an egg to it!!  Their happy hour is 3-7pm everyday, $1 black label beer, $2 steam buns, $5 half sized noodles."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for ramen in NE Ohio. Granted, other restaurants in NE Ohio don't seem to know what kind of noodles ramen is comprised of, but that's neither here nor there. For all the people giving Noodlecat one star because it isn't \"what they had in California/Japan\"... get up outta' here with that ish. It's not authentic, but it's not supposed to be.  Positives: - Cute location & good music - Wonderful, chewy, curly noodles and tasty broth - Consistently fluffy steam buns - Perfect 6 minute egg  Needs improvement: - The menu overhaul they did about a year ago was mostly negative (except for reducing the portion size, and thus, price). They took away their two best steam buns (brisket and pulled pork) and 98% of their beer options. - They seem to be out of the few items the menu does have pretty often. Last time we were there, a couple next to us ordered 3 items in a row the restaurant was out of. I was embarrassed for them. My husband ordered a Sopporo (one of the three beers on the menu), and they were out at 6 P.M. on a Saturday. They also were out of the ginger beer I ordered.  In summation, I'll continue to frequent this place, but I really wish they'd bring some of their best items back to the menu and stock the ones they claim to have."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The sticky buns alone are amazing (recommend the pork) but I will say the noodle dishes can be bland. I got the pork ramen and had to add a ton of soy to get some salty flavoring. But overall, very good and priced well! My daughter was impressed and the services was great!"}
{"text":"Not a very good representative of the ramen craze.  The noodles are too chewy and the sauce is over bearing.  Not enough veggies in the bowl either."}
{"text":"We had the beef short rib noodles and the some smoked tomato/curry/tofu thing. Both dishes were hot with lots of noodles. They were also both rather bland. Fortunately, there was a shaker of ground red pepper or cayan pepper at the table that have it a nice kick. Toss in some soy sauce and now we're talking!  The short ribs were tossed in a tasty BBQ sauce and were also good.   Not sure what a steamed bun is, so I tried the pulled pork. It was good, like a pulled pork slider. We also tried the chocolate peanut butter banana steamed bun for desert. I nice finish to the meal, but not a lot of flavor.   We arrived on. Friday night around 6:00 and has no problem getting a seat. By the time we left at 6:45, there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed soup connoisseur, I was thrilled to finally try this place for delivery. We used this delivery service (review coming soon). We had the fried chicken steamed bun, the braised rib rice plate and the college ramen. They were all yummy in their own right. The ramen definitely reminded me of the ramen I lived off of as a teenager, except better. But I definitely will try another soup next time. The steam bun was divine, my only complaint, too small. The rice place was good, maybe a little too onion-ey. It also came with green peppers, but I could do without onion next time. All in all, solid restaurant. Definitely craveable, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Almost a year later and my once favorite place hasn't redeemed itself.   I'm glad you can order the buns put together again, but when I recently came here for lunch they literally had 1 type of bun available. 1. I had been looking forward to a chicken bun for 2 days and all they had was pork.   The bowls were also limited, with 2 of the options removed. I got the spicy octopus and regretted it, though it did have flavor and lack of flavor is sometimes an issue here. The octopus was so tough, I could barely chew it enough to swallow it without gagging.   This all just makes me so sad."}
{"text":"Noodlecat was one of the few restaurants open the evening I was in downtown Cleveland.  Service was friendly, but the food was just average.  I had some wings as an appetizer that were decent, but nothing to write home about.  For my entree, I had the Shio College Ramen (chicken ramen).  It was incredibly bland but using a little salt and hot sauce at the table, I turned it into something enjoyable.    I don't know that I'd specifically seek out this restaurant again, but if given similar circumstances, it was a decent place for dinner."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at Noodlecat three times so far and I've loved it each time.   Yesterday I tried the pork ramen with corn (can't remember the official name) and it was very flavorful. It had a hint of hot with some chili oil. The pork was plentiful and delicious. My comment about all the noodle bowls is that the broth is super tasty. I'm not usually loving soup broth, but this is different.   I had the college ramen on my last visit. It was good, but much lighter. I would recommend this to my friends who are scared of noodle bowls. It's easy to like and not overboard.   The restaurant as a whole seems more like NYC than Cleveland. The seating is all stools so you won't be hanging out too long. However the drinks look great so I'd love to come for dinner and hang out. Not sure how that will work on the stools. We'll see.   Give it a try...you will like it."}
{"text":"We had a few appetizers and Asian noodle bowls at the Jonathon Sawyer restaurant.  The brussel sprouts appetizer was good, but overly salty.  The noodle bowls were good, but nothing special (especially for the price).  Hate to say this, but if I really want another Pho bowl...I'm headed to the East side of town."}
{"text":"The food and service were both decent, but nothing to write home to about. The only gripe we had was the music. It's 2015, you don't need to play 3 songs by Fun. If you are trying to be trendy you don't really need to play eminem."}
{"text":"Up until today I would have given four or five stars. They have gone to great lengths to reset the menu, clearly for the sake of standardizing and turning the restaurant into a chain. It had been a very local place that included nicely portioned lunch dishes, and now feels like a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Love Noodlecat. It's something fun to get away from the traditional downtown dining options. Not the cheapest place but you can order half bowls for half price which are actually pretty filling. I suggest the Spicy Octopus Udon. It's delicious and has a good kick without being overwhelming.  They have a cheap happy hour too with half bowls for $5, Steam buns for $1.5, and $1.50 Black labels I believe. Great for something different that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Noodlecat! Their steamed Brisket Bun is the best. College ramen is one my favorite dishes there. I bring all of my out of town friends there and they just love it."}
{"text":"Noodlecat has gone way downhill. It is sad. What used to be a great authentic ramen experience with great alternatives like the best chirashi in town has turned into a shadow of its former self."}
{"text":"The menu was extremely small and the food was extremely bland. I got the buttermilk fried chicken and ramen, the broth tasted like nothing and the fried chicken had less flavor than a shake n bake dinner. They were also out of a bunch of things."}
{"text":"Last Friday, I attempted my first Critical Mass bike ride. That's where like 400 bikers get together in Public Square and ride around together taking over traffic and being awesome? I've only been biking for a few weeks, and I had severely underestimated how long the ride was going to be. When it was all over and I was with my friends at the Hipp, I was completely covered in sweat and shaking. Like, my friend asked me if I had been rained on, I was so soaked. I was also starving, but the crowd was big at the Hipp, so my friends and I decided to go down to Noodlecat. That meant getting back on my bike and getting from E.55th to E.4th, which I understand is supposed to be nothing but was a MONUMENTAL task to me by then. On top of it, while we were biking down, it started pouring rain.   I tell you all this to illustrate what I felt like and what I must have looked like when I walked into Noodlecat. I was covered in a day's worth of sweat, dressed like a middle aged farm worker, and completely soaked in rain. All I wanted was some carbs and all the ice water in the entire world. I also only had about 20 dollars cash on me.   My friends, who are more experienced bike hipsters, looked wet but pristine. Ugh.  It was a Friday night but we were seated right away, and our server was immediately there with lots of water. She was wonderful the whole time, checked in with us frequently, kept the water filled, ect. I drank all the water, for real. The most reaction we got from our forlorn state were a couple of sympathetic smiles from the people we were seated next to.  That's always my favorite part about Noodlecat - the other places around E. 4th feel like they come with certain attire expectations. This place, I can just wander in there after a show or covered in dirty rain, and nobody cares. Someone was playing all these late 90s, early 2000s indie pop songs. It was super chill, and exactly what I needed.  I ordered two steam buns - the Fried Chicken and the Burger one, and a Danko Donut. I was worried, frankly, that if I ordered ramen I would end up with half of it on my shirt.  You know, because of the delirious exhaustion.  I've been to Noodlecat before, and I love the Mushroom Udon, but I'm also one of those people who hates mixing their food together, so ramen as a concept is always very hit or miss with me. But that no longer matters because I will for sure be eating these steamed buns every weekend I can. The burger and the chicken were both cooked perfectly, and oozing with flavor. The bun itself was wonderfully white and smushy and soft, and the little cucumber pickles were perfect. Two of them was exactly the right size meal I wanted to eat. I've been craving the fried chicken one ever since.   The donut was fresh and crunchy and hot and sticky with glaze, it was wonderful.    The very best part though was that my entire bill came to 6 and some change. I don't know if it was happy hour, or they applied the mythical bike discount, or what. But that waitress got a hefty tip for sure.   I haven't been to the Noodlecat at WSM yet, but I think I've got proper motivation to start biking down there weekly now, because it turns out there's a reason half the world's population is obsessed with steam buns and now I'm totally one of them.  I know this wasn't as funny as some of my other reviews, but my overwhelming feeling towards this place right now is gratitude, for being one of the few places downtown I feel totally comfortable at."}
{"text":"I found the pork miso broth to be too salty.   The Nama ramen had been cooked too long and my soup was delivered Luke warm.    Pork buns were pretty good.    We also had the house ramen college style.  Very bland. Probably a kid friendly dish but I also found these noodles to be over cooked and mush.    Didn't love this place."}
{"text":"Imagine the old Noodlecat and the food just isn't quite the same. The options are fewer. But you get to stand in line to order your food, fight for a seat, eat under bright white lights in a Chipotle style atmosphere and pay more! No thanks. I really can't see myself going back. If this is how you need to dumb it down to succeed at Crocker Park, count me out."}
{"text":"I was walking to Noodlecat when I passed by Hyde Park and smelled the most wonderful aroma.  I said, -no, I'm going to continue to Noodlecat and try it out. Besides, Hyde Park will cost me $20 for lunch.   Well...  Noodlecat costed me $20 for lunch, including my $1.66 tip. Break down: $12.99 The Hangover.  $3.99, to make it a meal with bun and drink. Tax and tip.  Twenty Bucks, (I realize $1.66 isn't a sufficient percentage for the tip but why am I tipping the cashier anyway?) Now, my revue is just going to be of the one dish I had on my one trip.  The other food there may be wonderful, (and not $20 for a bowl of soup with a steamed bread snack.) So you know, this wasn't my first noodle house.  I'm actually a fat, seasoned veteran of world noodle houses.  This was my first in Crocker Park which is a premiere Ohio destination, (you may not have known that Ohio has destinations.) I'm sure the rent is $8,000 a month which means $20 bowls of soup. Let me get to my review...   Here's the quick version:  I got The Hangover- I liked the egg. Here's the extended version...   Presentation was good.  I liked how it looked, even though it cost $20.  It was small.  If you ever go to a respectable noodle house in Japan, Nobu Niguchi of Nagasaki, Nippon will serve you a salad bowl full of noodles and shame you until you eat it all.  EIGAREN!  Yoo leetool ba-bee!  EAT!!! All of it! The $20 bowl of noodles I got from Noodlecat was smaller than my kid's cereal bowl.  It consisted of Ramen noodles and juice, kimchi, shredded pork, bacon, shoestring fries, and shoyu tamago, (egg.).  Ramen is popular with Japanese WWII survivors and UC Davis survivors.  I prefer udon personally. The kimchi was mushy.  The pork was reminiscent of cheap Carolina BBQ.  The juice, which should be the icing surrounding noodle cake, was boring.  It tasted like thickened chicken broth with ginger. The shoestring fries which I believe they called Japanese Fries, (note: Japanese fries are what we call \"McDonalds\" fries, NOT shoestring fries,) were good but you had to get them out of the way to eat anything else.  They were long and skinny and hard and poked me in the face while I was trying to get to the juice- like a man lost in the desert trying to bite a cactus.   The shoyu tamago, I liked.  It was mild with a creamy yolk.  Could have used a longer soy bath. To end, the shrimp bun sucked.  Bun was cold and dry.  One tiny piece of breaded shrimp?  Not even tempura? Oh!  And the soda machine was on the blink! I had seltzer water instead of Cherry Pepsi."}
{"text":"This is Chef Jonathon Sawyer's other place, or places now that he has two Noodlecat locations. Noodlecat gets beat up quite a bit here on yelp while Saigon around the corner shines which is beyond me. The atmosphere here is fantastic and the food is very tasty.  So far, I have tried the pork miso ramen with a six minute egg and was very pleased. All of the menu items are very creative and clever as you would expect knowing the chef. He pays homage to L.A. favorites on the menu at both of his restaurants and I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.   Most of the bad reviews are comparing Noodlecat to traditional Japanese ramen and it's a shame the haters can't try it for what it claims to be. From the website, \"Noodlecat is a slurpalicious Japanese-American mash-up from Chef Jonathon Sawyer.\" He never claims you are going to get traditional ramen so all of you Japanese food experts need to get over yourselves and try this place for what it is."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place before it moved to Westlake so I decided to try it out with Uber Eats since I live nearby. Not more than 10 minutes passed between ordering and delivery but that's unfortunately where the positives end and the fact that this place is almost always empty should've been a tip off. The shrimp in my cold steam bun (the Uber Eats photo shows TWO buns and I only got one) were overcooked and chewy and the also cold 7 spice fries were tasteless. I admittedly have never had this style of fries before but they literally looked just like those piknik fries you can buy anywhere for a two bucks except with ZERO seasoning...not even salt! I guess now I know why they up and moved to Crocker Park all of a sudden. To exploit the endless stream of tourists to make money instead of by making quality food."}
{"text":"My last visit to Noodlecat was on Wednesday July 22 at about 7:00 pm.   Overall, the food was great, but the service left something to be desired. My guest and I sat up front and watched as literally every table that came in after us receive their food well before us. I was just about to ask our waitress why we hadn't yet received our food when it came out.   The delay in receiving the food was not the only issue. We also watched every other table receive their steam buns as an app followed by their ramen some minutes later. For us, everything came out at once. This led to a meal of delicious steam buns followed by a less-than-appetizing bowl of cold ramen. Our ticket was clearly lost and/or the order was never put in, but we didn't get more than a half-hearted apology from the wait staff for the food taking so long.   All that said, I like the format of the new menu and would have been very pleased with the food had the meal came out on time and with the right pacing."}
{"text":"I think four stars is fair because the food is good, but nothing spectacular. Recommend the fried chicken. I got it by accident. They gave me that, at first, instead of the college ramen. When I told the bartender, he was very cool about it and fixed the mistake, and made things very right. I won't get into details because some cheap ass will come along and read this and try to replicate the situation. So sorry cheap-ass loser, go back to Denny's and leave bad tips.  Fresh veggies in the ramen were tasty and crunchy. I'll go back."}
{"text":"A truly great restaurant! Great staff, nice helpful waitress. I got 5 different steamed buns for 2$ each since it's Sunday all-day happy hour. 5$ half order of ramen. I got a banana chocolate peanut butter bun for dessert!!!! My gf got a ramen with matzo and brisket. I tried it and totally awesome!!! I highly recommend!!!! Don't trust the bad reviews!! Salt was in a perfect level! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what everyone is talking about with the portions here. I got the Tsukemen Ramen like a lot of other people (come on, who can resist pork belly?) with a fried egg, and the portion was easily enough for two people which should completely negate the $13 for it. and i'm a guy that can put away a LOT of food.  The dish itself is my new death row meal, but I'm saving that last star to see if the rest of the menu holds up, among other complaints.  The service was excellent, and speedy and for a small trendy spot like this, a casual air should be expected.  However, while I found the prince and portions of what I got to be a two-person type deal, the prices for everything else seemed really steep for a kind of restaurant thats typically more of a late night place. That brings me to another complaint, is the hours. In Pittsburg there are a decent number of noodle shops and asian places open to well around midnight, and Noodlecat's hours of 11-9 seemed very counterintuitive compared to that expectation of a noodle house. That being cheap good food late at night.  Food wise, I have zero complaints, but from the business side I'd say Chef Jon leans a little too close to his french haute cuisine roots for something thats supposed to be a humble but quality noodle shack."}
{"text":"Tried to go because I loved the downtown restaurant and bought $200 in Team Sawyer gift cards. No dice. Sign at the cashier said they weren't honoring gift cards yet. The Cashier said they're never going to accept the Team Sawyer gift cards."}
{"text":"Service was good and gluten-free menu, excellent.  Will be back. Extensive Vegan and Gluten-free options and the kimchi salad I had was the bomb."}
{"text":"Had the pork ramen which was flavorful and satisfying.  Huge portion and a perfectly cooked soft egg. The pork was soft and there wasn't so much that it downplayed the noodle.   The bacon steam buns were good, though they could have been hotter. Just the right amount of sauce on it do you could still taste the bacon and pickle.   The brussel sprouts were amazing, crunchy and crispy with tons of flavor!  The dressing was tangy and a bit bitter, which cut the sprouts well.   Decor kind of lacked here, simple but not done well...seemed thrown together."}
{"text":"Get the japanese fried chicken steam bun. Or any of the steam buns. The steam buns are amazing.  I pretty much always get the pork miso ramen. A half portion plus a few steam buns is enough to fill me up. Sometimes the ramen isn't as flavorful as it should be, but 90% of the time it's spot on.  I agree with Nick that the seats are not comfortable and can be really awkward. I try to sit at the bar sometimes because the bar stools have backs."}
{"text":"Lunch at Noodlecat in Downtown Cleveland was a great experience. We were seated immediately at 1 pm. The menu, though not large, offered some variety. We settled on two ramen dishes, a pork miso ramen and a barbecue short rib ramen. We also had ice tea and a barbecue chicken bun. Although we ordered 1/2 orders, the portions were more than sufficient. The bun featured some tempura style chicken tenderloins, lettuce and a sweet tangy sauce. It was very good. The pork miso ramen featured an earthy miso broth and perfectly cooked pork. The barbecue rib ramen featured three sliced rib portions (like kal bi) crusted with a sweet, tangy sauce. The broth was earthy but featured a spicy bite. All the dishes were delicious. The service was attentive but not eager, the atmosphere relaxed and eclectic and the two half portions, bun and drinks came to $25. All in all a good downtown lunch experience."}
{"text":"When I was sick a friend offered to pick me up some noodles from Noodlecat.  I picked the Dan Dan Ramen and added smoked bacon to them.  Yummy!  Nice level of heat that beautifully cleared out my sinuses."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a restaurant and thought, \"I just don't fit in here.\" ? That's how I feel every time I go to NoodleCat. My husband and I first tried this place 3 years ago, when we were celebrating our anniversary in Cleveland. Walk in and there are small-ish tables with stools in the front room. I don't like sitting on stools, because it don't like not having back support, so we always choose to sit in the back room, where there are long benches along the wall.    The service is just \"eh\", and I think it's partly because the servers are seriously TOO hipster, if there is such a thing. It's almost like they feel like they are too cool, or smart for the job. You will find them just standing against the wall hanging with each other, and they only come to your table to take your order or bring your food. Maybe it's hard to walk in those super tight skinny jeans. I don't know.  On to the food. So, I complained about the ambience and I don't like the service, so what do I like? I come here for the food. My favorite noodle bowl is the pork miso ramen, and my husband loves the crispy beef short rib ramen. My grandma is Japanese, and these bowls remind me of her cooking. The pulled pork steam bun is soooo good. And we've also had the Japanese fried chicken steam bun. The Kim chi salad-Authentic. The last time I was there, they had an apple pie sake, that seriously tasted like Apple pie, and I could easily have gotten drunk on them, but it was only noon.   In conclusion, the food is good. To me it's like Japanese comfort food. (I don't know why I haven't brought my grandma here, yet. I know she'd like it. ) Would I come back to eat? Yes. And in defense of the hipsters, I don't know, maybe if I worked for Chef Jonathon Sawyer I'd be too cool, too."}
{"text":"Jesus. They really call this place a noodle shop? And on top of that, you're going to charge me $11 for a bowl of noodles? Noodlecat, you fooled me once with your cool logo, but never again will I subject myself to a meal at your establishment. I came here to Noodlecat really nervous. With the 3 star review on Yelp, I knew that this place was really going to be hit or miss. Sadly, this is quite the miss. On the plus side, Noodlecat does look hip I guess. It really seems like they are going for that cool look to it and that's nice and all, except for the fact that the food sucks.   If you really, really have to come here, then at least come during happy hour. The 1/2 bowl of noodles is $5, buns are discounted to $2, and there are some deals on drinks too. $3 for a pint of Sapporo is what I ended up going with.   I ordered the Takahachi ramen and good lord, holy bland broth Batman. I decided that I needed a whole portion of noodles, so I ended up forking up the $11. Sadly, Noodlecat decided to screw me with their sad excuse for noodles, and laugh at me in the process. The Takahachi ramen looked nice, but that's not why I get ramen. I want my amazing noodles, broth, and chashu. Instead, I got a flavorless broth, a really small portion of packaged noodles, and then a chunk of pork. To make matters worse, the pork was pretty flavorless as well.   I think the only redeeming factor, aside from the alcohol which they can't possibly mess up, is are the buns. The buns aren't the best in the world, but at least they are acceptable. I decided to go with the Japanese fried chicken bun. For $2, these buns are pretty damn small. It literally was 2 bites, so I guess $1 a bite? The chicken was fried pretty nicely, but I just found it all too sweet. It was like I was eating a bun dipped in syrup.  Noodlecat, you have a cool logo, but your food is just flat out horrible. Even with happy hour prices, you will never have my consideration as a dining establishment in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Noodlecat.  I ordered Vegetarian Soba Noodles...meh, incredibly salty, hard to appreciate the flavor.  Thankfully the broth that accompanied the meal down played the intense salt....may need to try something different before I finalize my opinion in NC."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My ramen came out lukewarm.  The broth had no body and was skimpy.  The fried Japanese chicken bun was so boring, like eating crispy Kentucky fried chicken on a bun. The healthy salad of kale, quinoa, blueberries (albeit 2 blueberries) was okay.  The coffee was the really the best part of the meal. So much hype about Noodlecat, why?  Jonathan Sawyer, where are you?"}
{"text":"I'm not very picky at all but wow, this place is bad. I went for the first time on 8/25 and the only star I'm giving is for service. I had great, friendly and fast service my entire dining experience. What I didn't have, was great food. I ordered the Nama ramen with pork miso... Talk about bland. The broth could have used wayyy more flavor, salt, seasoning, anything. It literally tasted like I was eating ramen with water. The amount of hot sauce I added wasn't even enough to make my bowl taste any better. I left unsatisfied and completely disappointed. Want some good ramen? Go down the street to Pho Thang- they're amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, very engaging, from Albert. Wings & buns were fantastic, along with the noodles."}
{"text":"Great place for steamed buns especially during Happy Hour -- $2 buns. Reminds me very much of the Taiwanese hamburger (gua bao). Love the variety of buns available -- would recommend the Japanese fried chicken -- like the crunchy exterior with a little bit of a spicy kick. Also had the Ohio Beef Brisket with Matzo Ramen. Noodles were so so, the broth a bit salty for my taste. Very glad to have found a place that excels at steamed buns in the Midwest!"}
{"text":"Food was good for the most part. Got the Fried Chicken Ramen, but wish I got a little more of the chicken. Got only 2 pieces styled like meatballs it seems whick I thought wasnt nearly enough. Felt they were holding the meal back a bit. Noodles were excellent though and got to use some chopsticks for the 1st time in a long time  Seemed to be kind of dead I went as well. For a weekend at night, I expected alot more peaple to be in there. Gave me a feel that its more popular with the lunch and take out crowd than a sit down place. Cause just a few hundred feet away on E 4th, every restaurant was packed it seems.  Server was excellent too."}
{"text":"I went to the noodlecat at west side market last weekend, and I completely regret it. I ordered the spicy tofu udon, which sounded delish. I substituted ramen noodles for udon because the guy behind the counter told me that udon noodles would take longer to cook and I would have to wait awhile.   As soon as I got the soup and started eating, I noticed that the broth was hardly warm and the noodles weren't close to being cooked. I waited a few minutes, and the noodles were still hard and raw as ever, and I realized that these noodles would never be cooked in a barely lukewarm broth. Flavor-wise, this dish was also a fail. When I order something spicy, especially at an Asian place, I expect my food to be spicy. Nope. Not here. The broth tasted as if a cube of vegetable bullion was thrown into the cooking water. This food was gross, bland, and a waste of my money. I would have been much more happy and satisfied with a cup 'o' noodles that costs 49 cents at the grocery. Get it together, noodlecat."}
{"text":"Very disappointing especially as a fan of the former venue. Ramen doesn't work in paper bowls. My udon noodles were gummy and my daughter's dish had a hard boiled egg, not the soft center expected in a ramen bowl. Very expensive and felt like eating a fast food venue while groovy had no soul or comfort. Missed opportunity for a good Asian option on Westside."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever eaten! I got food poisoning from the Ramen and fried mini-sandwiches. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm a big Jonathan Sawyer fan and loved the original noodlecat, but this was a massive disappointment. The College Ramen broth tasted exactly like water. No flavor what so ever. The chicken buns were made with chicken that I would guess was fried 2 hours ago. We also had the pork miso ramen, which was average."}
{"text":"Ordered to go.. Udon noodles were so greasy I poured out at least 3 tablespoons of oil. My dish was about the quality of Panda Wok at double the price."}
{"text":"This location is more like a chain now like a chipotle half the old menu is gone. I ordered the bowel called the hangover bowel the broth was practically non existent and so salty they covered it with potatoes strings so much that you saw nothing but potato strings gross. The noodles they are using now are practically nonexistent for a place called noodle cat you think they would have more and better ramen but no it's not the same as when they were downtown it's pretty bad actually and I used to love noodle cat. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I was very sad to hear that the downtown location was closing, but happy then to learn of this new location. Unfortunately, much of what set apart the old restaurant has been erased from this new version.   The choices have been seriously dumber down and limited, as can be seen in the choice of ramen noodles (now a total of one variety.) Furthermore some of the things that remain are also a shell of their former selves. For example, the chicken leg I ordered today with the noodles was some luke warm, limp, overly salty shake and bake sort of thing as opposed to the ones downtown which were always amazingly good, crispy and hot.   Other disappointments include plastic bowls and having to eat the broth with standard small plastic spoon. Really? You make a broth we are supposed to enjoy and we are to eat it with that?  I hope they will get better, but this new version is in no way close to the past glory."}
{"text":"Have you ever smiled big? Well you will here! Atmosphere was like Disney World but on a smaller scale (Japanese Disney World). It was positive and open with fantastic lighting. I ordered a couple steam buns were scrumptious (which were to die for) (not literally). Man, these buns were soft!!! Also, the waitress made an innuendo about \"getting it in\" (regarding the chop sticks) And we went right back to smiling! I do have to dock one orange star due to the small glasses of water and low stools. Figure it out guys! Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good atmosphere. Good is overpriced. I spent $20 on lunch for one meal coffee and tip."}
{"text":"We tried Noodle cat for our friend's bday and it was defiantly something different and surprisingly good. The food is ramen noodles made into different variation. I gave it a four because of the creativity of the dishes. The servers were friendly and tentative. It is a smaller venue so I would not recommend large groups."}
{"text":"I still don't know why this place is getting over one star. A bowel of Roman noodle and one piece of chicken wing for $13 and $3 drink and ended up paying over $20. The food doesn't even test good. Please do urself a favour, go somewhere else and eat a decent meal with that $20. I'm not going there again."}
{"text":"Friends and I were walking around Cleveland, attempting to find a place to eat. We were surprised to see that the majority of restaurants we passed were closed, but noodle cat was open. They have an eclectic menu- mainly noodles, and our waiter was kind enough to go over everything with us.     My favorite thing ate was the bun, they were full of fresh flavors, and the serving size was small, but perfect for getting a bowl as well. My smoked tomato coconut curry noodle dish was good, but not exciting. The tofu wasn't cooked particularly well, and the broth was fairly bland.  I would likely not order it again in the future.  Everyone I was with enjoyed their food, and I was incredibly happy that it was open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Noodlecat is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Love the vibe of the restaurant. I would describe it as modern hipster if that makes sense. Love the acoustics in the dining area. Musical selection is eclectic and adds a nice touch to the overall experience.   The specialty here is fancy ramen noodles and steam buns. Also have a few rotating entrees as well as salads. My usual move is to head over for Happy Hour and get 2 steam buns for $5 and half a noodle for $5. Dishes are creative and ingredients are fresh and top of the line. The Ramen's are ever rotating but one of the staples is the Pork miso. A pretty safe choice although some are not down with a 6 minute egg. They also have a college ramen which is a solid choice for the tepid. Add a half an Avacodo or some pork to jazz it up would be my recommendation. Today I tried a beef brisket ramen which was phenomenal. Consisted of soy braised Swiss chard, soy egg, fennel fawns and of course beef brisket. I will for sure order this one again and recommend it if you see it on the menu. Also ordered a beef brisket and fried chicken steam buns. The beef brisket is tender and flavorful. The fried chicken is a staple of the menu and pretty phenomenal.   If going with another person I strongly suggest splitting an order of Brussels sprouts. Chefs seem to love to dress up Brussels sprouts and Chef Sawyers effort here is one of the best I have tried. Also of note is the Japanese Chopped salad. I have had some interesting house made sake flavors so be sure to ask about what may be available.   Good place to grab a bite before a game. Don't really need a reservation and they will get you in and out. Staff is typically very friendly and knowledgable. Really a nice change if pace to other food options in town."}
{"text":"Was feeling hungry so went to Crocker and spotted this place. Intriguing and inviting from the outside, myself and my husband much prefer this set up of restaurant whereby you go and order your food instead of being waited on at a table. We get to the counter, never been here before so the cheerful guy at the desk recommends the pork bowl. Despite this, he never remembered my order and forgot to put it through so we had to re-order it. Doesn't really bother me normally, especially if the food is worth the price. Husband takes a bite of his chicken, it was pink inside so put him off eating. Without the meat, the bowl is just a really cheap style noodle in a really bland broth, and a few sesame seeds tossed in. Perhaps if your lucky, you taste the odd bite of cilantro. Really wasn't worth over $10 a meal, won't be going back.  I did enjoy the futuristic style knife and fork and spoon dispenser, that was cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick noodle bowl. We loved the friendly, chilled vibe. Our server was awesome -the place was packed and he was working hard and did a great job.  We ordered the hangover - broth was very flavorful and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. They also have $2 beers during happy hour which is a great price for downtown!  Good on a cold night if you're in the mood for a relaxed and satisfying evening."}
{"text":"Return To Noodlecat.  So I said I wouldn't be going back to Noodlecat unless they made some changes. Well, they went ahead and made some changes...and they are positive ones too!  The menu has been changed a little bit...nothing drastic...the prices are the same, but  Noodlecat has really stepped up their game in the happy hour department.  You can see it here: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=212279935518600&set=a.114180958661832.21589.107607652652496&type=1&theater  It was this happy hour, and a picture of their vegetarian special for Friday that enticed me to come back. I was pretty excited about getting a half order of noodles, a steam bun, and a beer for all under $10. Unfortunately, the bartender informed me that specials can not have happy hour pricing. Sad, but understandable.  I decided to go with the special anyways. The picture on facebook looked awesome, and I was excited about the teriyaki-tomato based sauce. Overall,  the noodles were decent. I loved all of the vegetables, and I think the udon noodles here are much better than their ramen.  Noodlecat still isn't perfect, but it has a lot of potential. I can see it getting better, and because they are trying to, I think I might come back again. The happy hour could be one of the best downtown, and downtown has a lot of great happy hours. This could be a place where my friends and me hang out before catching a show or a game.  If you do decide to give Noodlecat a chance, check out their happy hour, and make sure to ask about their specials. Both times I had the special, I left a happy camper."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst bowl of Ramen I have ever had.  Zero care given to the food served here. Just turn and burn until the close the doors."}
{"text":"Took my family of 5 spent a fortune, and did not taste like it smells. Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"In from out of town, stopped in for a quick lunch. Everything was good, but nothing I would go back for. The menu was a little confusing, we thought we were ordering soup but noodle we ordered was just a noodle - no broth. We got 4 buns, tempura, fried chicken, burger and bacon. They were fine but something was missing..."}
{"text":"I really love noodle soups and since we were headed to a game, I thought this would be the perfect place. I used to come for their spicy octopus but decided to get their pork broth. Worst decision ever.   The broth was half salt and half fat. In the end, the taste of fat won, unfortunately. The pork was essentially chewy pulled pork in a liquid. The color of the broth was even off-putting and I love all soups - free, cheap and weird.  First time I reached my limit!  Next time I will read the reviews before going to a restaurant. Being a yelper, I get it; joke's on me.  Go to the Cajun place next door. Even if you're craving noodles. Really."}
{"text":"Noodlecat understandably has an identity crisis on Yelp.  I've found it to be a bit of an acquired taste as I like it a little more each time I go.  Everything from the decor, atmosphere, food and clientele are a little different from the typical restaurant in the area, however given the chance, I've found most adventurous eaters learn to like Noodlecat and its unique offerings (to Cleveland).  First, Noodlecat has an excellent happy hour.  $1 Black Labels, $5 half-portion noodles, 2/$5 steam buns and $3 Sapporo drafts are all excellent values for the surrounding area.  The happy hour runs until 7 PM. and usually draws a good crowd.  It's also a good way to try Noodlecat for the first time, as you can get an assortment of items from the menu to try to figure out what you like.  In terms of food, I've found different menu items have a strong following depending on individual tastes.  My personal favorites are: the spicy octopus stir fry udon, the pork miso ramen, the pulled pork steam bun, the Japanese cobb salad, and the butcher's bun special.  Most everything they serve has a very unique flavor with very interesting combinations.  Also the vegetarian daily special is very popular with several vegetarian coworkers."}
{"text":"Glad that I was able to try this place, but I have definitely had better Japanese Ramens. Located in downtown, it was very busy for a weekday. Went with the House Ramen with Crispy Beef Short Ribs ($10) and it was very flavorful! It's not your traditional Japanese Ramen, but it did have a nice spin to it. The House Ramen noodles were not the traditional Ramen noodles that you usually get, so that was disappointing. They were very chewy and did not hold much flavor in them. I'm glad I went with the Crispy Beef Short Ribs because it was so flavorful. They are Korean style short ribs and they did give me quite a bit which was nice. Again, this satisfied my Asian craving, but there are better Japanese Ramen places out there. They do a great job at marketing this genre of food since I think most Americans have never heard of this and they try to have other items on the menu, like Chicken buns, for the less adventurous folks out there.   Pros: - great variety of menu items for people who are willing to be daring or want something more basic to start off with - Lots and lots of noodles and they have some buns too  Cons:  - House ramen noodles were a little too chewy for my taste and aren't the traditional ramen noodles - My broth just seemed just a little too salty, but it was edible  Why I gave it a 3... While I am proud that they offer Japanese Ramen to Americans in a fun way with many options, I have still had better Japanese Ramen in other cities. Service was a little odd the day I came in because their credit card reader was broken and the waitress was trying to get everyone's credit card numbers to swipe for later in the day? Why not just tell everyone it' cash only for the day. Definitely try the Cripsy Beef Short Ribs if you like Korean BBQ and want a touch of sweetness to your food!"}
{"text":"I did not like this place overall. My brother and I went to this place, and after we came back, both my brother and I experienced stomach aches and did not feel good after. The soup in the noodles was not that good either."}
{"text":"I'm totally in love with Noodlecat, perhaps to an unhealthy extent. The flavor combinations in each bowl of noodles and buried inside of each steamed bun are perfectly matched and delicious. I'm a particularly big fan of the Takahachi Ramen and the Tsukemono steamed bun. I would be a much happier person if I could eat those once a day every day.   A lot of reviewers are complaining about the prices, but Noodlecat has some crazy extended happy hours, including all day on Sundays. I love to go there for dinner with my husband on Sundays, get a half order of ramen (it's plenty big) for $5, a few steamed buns for $2 each, and a $1 can of Black Label. Our bill is usually about $8 per person."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Cleveland!  Noodlecat has figured out happy hour and brought it with a force. The hours are from 3-7, almost every day of the week. They have $5 noodle bowls, $3 steam buns, and usually a good beer on tap for $3 a pint.  Fantastic value and food---definitely a happy hour must."}
{"text":"New menu...not so good. The super salad was awesome. It was a little different than it used to be but still very good. Several items have been removed and the items left were not my first choice. I ordered the college ramen and the noodles were so overcooked they were pretty much mush. Not sure if I will be back. Very disappointing. Our server was very nice though and he was the only one in the entire restaurant..it seems they were a little under staffed."}
{"text":"For living on east 4th st, I was highly disappointed in myself for not visiting this place sooner since it is so popular. When I finally visited for Sunday's all-day happy hour, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. I was expecting some amazing pho dish with ramen noodles but i think the hype ruined it. I told the server it was my first time here and I did not know what half the menu read, and she was not helpful at all. So I said \"what is a popular one?\" and proceeded with a random item on the menu because she said everyone is different. I got the tomato-curry soba noodles with tofu and could not eat them because they were so bland! My boyfriend got the octopus noodles and WE LOVED THEM. So I am giving 3 stars for the extremely flavorful noodles that my boyfriend and I devoured. I also have to add that their steam buns are phenomenal! We asked which ones were the most popular again but with no direct answer, we randomly picked the pulled pork and CAB burger. We LOVED them. They were so soft and flavorful. I cannot wait to go back for $5 half-bowl portions for happy hour M-F 3-7pm or Sunday all-day and get the octopus noodles. The deal also includes 2 for $5 steam buns. What a treat! I think you should go with someone who has been before or at least keep prodding the server for more details. The GHT saison was tasty too!"}
{"text":"SO UPSET with the new changes. I used to go here all the time, but I was busy at work and trying to save money so I haven't gone in about a month. Went back today and a lot was different. They no longer has their specialty coffee drinks or any of the awesome drink creations Adrian (the bartender) made on the menu, they no longer have the veggie cake as a protein add-on, their portions are a lot smaller for more money, no more half salad/half noodle combo, my usual dish doesn't taste the same at all... I'm just sad that all my favorite things are gone. I was once a Noodlecat loyal and now I will probably have to take my money elsewhere. Sigh..."}
{"text":"So disappointing!  Jonathon Sawyer....this is a fail.  The menu is small and expensive.  You can't make your own creation (which was my first question).  My mom and I had lunch there and it cost us $30.  At Crocker Park, I'm ok paying a bit more for a meal but the meal better be good!  Such as, The B Spot...it's a bit pricey but the meal is always good!  The decor is fine but the food presentation is not very appetizing.  The steam buns were dry and not very hot at all and again, small for $2.99 each for 2 bites of food.  The bowl was gross and not worth $12.99.  The quality and value is not there at all.  I'm a fan of Cleveland and anyone trying to make Cleveland successful, and I think Jonathon Sawyer is trying to do that!  However, this restaurant needs re-vamped!"}
{"text":"How disappointing- I was so excited to try out this noodle shop concept, perhaps my excitement escalated my expectations.  I got the lunch combo with the salad and noodle soup.  The Choy n'Soi salad was disappointing- salty with monotonous flavor profile.  The hardboiled soy soaked egg was ok- not too salty.    The Roscoe's Fried Chicken & Ramen saved the lunch.  The chicken is nicely fried and completely crispy around the whole piece of chicken- satisfied my every craving for crispiness.  The chicken sits in light nicely sweet and spicy syrup.  The chicken needs a little more marinating/seasoning inside the coating.  The noodle soup is bland- it needs a savory component (broth is not enough).  But, I would definitely take the fried chicken again and again with a little more of the syrup."}
{"text":"First of all, you should know I like CATS, so I am automatically prejudiced in favor of any place with a Cat name, and a logo of a cheery noodle eating Cat.  But I really did enjoy Noodlecat. The food is soooo comforting and the portion is huge! I got the curly ramen (perfect texture ) with short rib (so tender in the middle and crispy on the edges) in a wondrous broth with accents of ginger, ornamented with lovely oriental vegetables. It was a symphony of flavor. I kept eating and eating, and it seemed I never made a dent in the bowl! I brought the leftovers all the way back to Cincinnati, and enjoyed them as a second meal yesterday.  We also had two steam bun sliders, fried chicken and veggie tempura, which were crazy good. But I was disappointed to not see the pulled pork steam bun on the menu, as others have mentioned  how good this is.  The atmosphere is very casual. You mark your order on a sheet and hand it back. I suppose it's different if you order a special.  With the exception of the little back bar, all the seating is stools which might not be desirable for those who like to have a back on their chair. We sat at the bar, where  the music was a little too loud to suit me, but, there were a number of cheerful Japanese lucky cats smiling back at us and the TV was set on Cartoon Network. With a hot pot of green citron tea and my great big noodle bowl I was a contented camper.  Noodlecat, yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"With OK reviews I was nervous to try but friends birthday so must do as they wish.  We went about 2 hours before an Indians playoff game so it was PACKED. With 1 server though he was quick and our food was prompt. the steam buns were delicious, try the chicken, bacon and veggies!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located a few steps from our hotel and featuring a Japanese street snack and ramen type menu, we knew we had to try Noodlecat.  Washingtonians, don't expect anything in the vein of Toki. This is not that type of restaurant. I feel like the dishes here are more akin to what you can find at Honey Pig Izakaya. While tasty, the food doesn't quite have the finesse of some DC joints with Japanese menu offerings. For instance, Tom N's ramen broth lacked the complexity of Toki's, and you can tell that the broth didn't receive the same amount of TLC as the DC hot spot's; however, all the required fixings were present and the flavors were still good, though not exceptional.  Their rendition of dan dan mian, on the other hand, is quite unique and tasty, though again not necessarily sophisticated. I was so relieved that Noodlecat's version of the popular Chinese dish was meatless (dan dan mian often features pork) and actually was light on the peanut sauce, or maybe omitted it altogether. Don't get me wrong, I love A&J's peanutty dan dan noodles, but it's nice once in a while to try something different. Noodlecat's take featured chili oil and soy sauce more prominently.   Besides the food, we also enjoyed Noodlecat's casual vibe and friendly service. Clevelanders and non-Clevelanders alike can definitely have an enjoyable time here.Though the food isn't amazing, it's still good, and hits the spot when you want some flavorful noodles or indulgent Japanese drinking snacks."}
{"text":"Major disappointment.  I live downtown around the corner from the old Noodlecat location and can't count the amount of times I went there for the college ramen--great broth, tasty dried peas and corn, and mouth watering white meat chicken.  Big portion, great place, etc.  When I heard it was moving to Crocker Park i was disappointed.  After eating there, good riddance.  The bowl is a paper container that they serve to you with food that is sitting out and they throw a chicken leg on the college ramen now.  The broth had no taste, the peas and corn tasted like it came out of a can, and the chicken was greasy and not tasty at all.   Here's what $13 gets you."}
{"text":"I had a spontaneous lunch downtown at Noodle Cat one day, and was so pleased to find a nuanced food option in Cleveland.  Having lived in NYC for 10 years, I'm used to being able to find whatever my (now fairly specific) cravings demand at a moment's notice.  The vibe reminded me of a conceptual sushi place in Williamsburg Brooklyn that serves \"bombs\" instead of rolls.  I like a restaurant that takes Japanese inspiration and does its own thing with it, so Noodle Cat was impressive.  Especially in a small city like Cleveland where you'd expect only broad-stroke, trying to please everyone mediocrity, Chef Sawyer proves that subtly sophisticated tastes are catered to here."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The service is quick and friendly, the tap list may be small but it is always mighty - my most recent visit included trying New Belgium's Tart Lychee beer.  Yum.  My friend and I had been biking downtown and dodging storms and we approached right as they were about to close.  One of the servers happened to overhear my friend (recently moved back to OH) say she'd always wanted to try it and he insisted that we stay.  We both had the Fiery Dan Dan noodles, I like mine with a 6-minute egg and it was delicious as always (not my first visit).  This is definitely one of my favorite spots downtown.  I love the upbeat atmosphere and know I can count on great tunes overhead accompanying my meal.  Our experience there, both the food, service, and atmosphere definitely helped sell my friend on the downtown CLE experience!  Thanks, Noodlecat!!!"}
{"text":"I went here twice and the best thing I had was the spicy udon. It was great, spicy but not just salty! Good texture and included some veggies! The other thing I had was the tenpura kale soba. The broth was really salty and the tenpura was very thickly crunchy. Also who ever heard of tenpura-ing a whole egg? That took me by surprise."}
{"text":"I ate at Noodlecat excited for the authentic ramen. I got the fried chicken ramen. The chicken was pink inside. It was not cooked through. It's too pricey to try again and again for overcooked ramen, a fully cooked poached egg, and not cooked chicken."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan of Noodlecat but don't think I will return. I was in the search of Cleveland ramen - and thought Noodlecat would squash my hunger!  When I arrived, the gal who noted herself as my server didn't return to put in my order until about 10 minutes, even after it was obvious that I had filled out my choice on the paper within 1 minute.  30 minutes later she brought out my food, which she didn't mention wasn't a traditional ramen dish with broth, but more so a \"stir-fry\" meal which she said was equally good. I didn't come to Noodlecat for stir-fry, so I was pretty disappointed. I asked if I could just order some broth to put into the dish, but she seemed to think that would be a bad idea. She offered other suggestions, but there was no way I would wait ANOTHER minute after waiting for 30. I asked for my order to go, because after sitting there for nearly an hour and disappointed, I had to leave.  She brought me my check and dish immediately - and when I returned to my office to open it, was shocked that a small portion of \"stir-fry\" (noodles with sauce and some peanuts) took HALF an hour to make! Very disappointing.  I have enjoyed Noodlecat in the past, but the poor service will keep me from returning. If anything, why didn't she give me an update when I looked up at her from the table half a dozen times after twenty minutes had passed? She would have earned some points in my mind if she were keeping me updated with the process. If anything ,she could have warned me that my dish wouldn't include broth. Most people eat ramen expecting broth!  My search for delicious vegetarian ramen in Cleveland continues ..."}
{"text":"Not entirely thrilled with this place. I received a snarky comment from the bartender after asking if a dish could be prepared a certain way without it being spicy. She answered \"by not ordering it.\" I didn't appreciate the comment so I was immediately turned off for the rest of the visit. Overall, the food was decent, but the atmosphere is a bit pretentious and hip.  If you do end up giving it a shot, know that a 6 minute egg means runny hardboiled egg. Not sure if we weren't educated enough to know that but now we, and you, know for future reference. Try the \"super food\" salad, though. Very good and healthy. Overall, I would skip noodlecat and try some where else, or maybe come during happy hour one day."}
{"text":"been a fan since their location in the westside market. the best in the winter, nothing beat holding the warm container in your hands as you walk around market square, before slurping down the rest of your broth. and when they moved to their restaurant on euclid we got a bigger menu with the same quality. Now? I hate to say it but its just plain pitiful. the containers were at least three times bigger with five times more broth. and the menu is just so small.. the quality of the food has fallen too; instead of feeling like a hearty meal it was almost too greasy to finish, and the flavor combos don't make sense. Yet its the same price as before. I guess if you've never been to noodlecat before the westlake location it would be alright. It's just sad that this business had the magic touch when it came to american influenced ramen, but now its just seems like a cheap knockoff of asian food. Hope to see it improve someday  TL;DR If you're someone who knows their ramen don't bother here"}
{"text":"I've been excited to visit Noodlecat for quite a while and recently had the chance to stop in for lunch. I'm sorry to say my expectations exceeded the actual experience. I suppose I was hoping for Momofuku Noodle Bar quality, which is a pretty high standard I realize, and maybe that was not fair to Noodlecat. That said, the food was fine - we tried two different half orders of ramen (pork miso, and crispy short rib), and five or six different steamed buns (my favorite was the pickle bun). My biggest concern is the restaurant just seemed a little dirty to me - dirty men's restroom, and somewhat sketchy cleanliness of the dining area. (The kitchen area was not visible to me so I have no idea about its cleanliness.) A less than spotless dining area is usually not a good sign in my book. If Noodlecat is meant to be more of a dive bar with interesting food, and less of a \"casual fine dining\" restaurant, then maybe it's accomplishing everything it's trying to be. But if they aspire to be Cleveland's version of Momofuku they have much work to do. I'll visit Noodlecat again sometime to see if I feel the same way a second time, and will happily update this review if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"I think I could have given this place a better rating if I had never gone to the original noodlecat. This new location lost all of the atmosphere of the old place and I think the fast casual food prep style has diminished the quality of food as well. It was also a bit pricey for what you're actually getting. It made me miss the location on Euclid a lot. I'm glad I tried the new place though. I don't think it's quite as awful as some of the reviews make It out to be. I think this is just what happens when you try to make a fast food version of a great restaurant."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!  I cant believe people gave it 5 stars.......they must be paid to review by Noodlecat. I gave it two stars because the service was fantastic but the food was sorry.  I went there again today just so that I could make sure I didnt have a bad 1st experience.  Guess what.....I had a bad second experience.  Heres the breakdown... PRICE: Way overpriced for what you get.  I left hungry both times QUANTITY: Looks big but its a large bowl filled halfway QAULITY: The noodels are good but the everything else is so bland.  I had chicken in mine today and it was boiled and had '\"O\" flavour and overcooked  ADVICE:  Go to the hotdog cart outside of Noodlecat...you will have a better experience.  If people say this place is good I have no idea what they think is bad."}
{"text":"Although the food was very good, they messed up BIG-TIME on my order. I am allergic to gluten and I ordered a gluten-free noodle dish off their gluten-free menu (and even specified that I needed it to be gluten-free). After eating the majority of the meal, I found out that THE NOODLES WERE NOT GLUTEN-FREE. I'm going to be very sick from this. They sent out the \"manager,\" who actually seemed to be the hostess and comped my meal. Our server tried to blame the kitchen, but when she showed me the ticket, it never specified that my specific order needed to be GF. I think she put it in wrong (other parts of my meal were also wrong, so that also leads me to believe she made the mistake and not the kitchen). I won't be going back here. Too much of a chance to take. Going to be a fun few days getting over the gluten in my system. :("}
{"text":"Nice place to grab ramen if you don't feel like driving all the way to Cleveland. People are nice and welcoming. I got the hangover and it was ok. Pork was a little too salty for me but it taste better after mixing the whole bowl. Over all it was just good for this cold weather"}
{"text":"Good if you're looking for a quick basic ramen fix, bad if you don't want to spend $15 on basic ramen. I was pretty ecstatic to stop in here because I love ramen places. It's small and feels a little crowded, but not too terrible. They only have a handful of options for your main dish so I went with the standard miso ramen. It was $10 for simple broth, ramen noodles, and pork. I added an egg for $1 and marinated kale for $2, still relatively plain. My biggest complaint with this place was the price for the simplicity of it all. Double noodles was an extra $4?! We've all seen/purchased a package of ramen for $0.30 so I'm not really sure where the justification for $4 extra noodles is. Overall, like I said in the beginning, if you're looking for a basic and pretty tasty quick fix of ramen, this might be the place for you. But if you don't want to spend the extra dollars for the add-ins and you like bold flavors, this might not be your spot."}
{"text":"\"Damn!\"  Phrase most used by our table on a recent visit.   As in \"damn that was good\".  Stopped here before a late night event downtown and were delighted by their second offering of a happy hour (9:00pm to 11:00pm).  I had the Roscoe's Fried Chicken Ramen bowl, and the The Butchers Bun.  The chicken was fried perfectly crispy, and was super juicy.  The broth was great, and had some mixed greens with the ramen.    I also had some of their sparkling sake.  While it wasn't my favorite beverage it was good.  The one I had was a bit too sweet for my tastes as it had an apple and peach thing going on with it.  It really reminded me of cotton candy.  But, that really is neither here nor there.  Noodlecat is a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"I love that Noodlecat has such an extensive vegan menu. I just wish I liked it more.  My noodles were nicely spiced but a little too chewy. The portion could have been bigger. The veg dumplings had an interesting but mushy filling.  The staff was nice but a little inattentive.  The outdoor seating offers a cool view of passersby."}
{"text":"Really good service. Steam buns are great!!! New menu and good stuff! Got beef short ribs with rice and pulled pork miso- excellent! Had a glass of wine and everything was great! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive Sunday happy hour, and my goodness those steamed buns are delicious. Can't really go wrong with $20 for a bowl of ramen, a steamed bun, and a beer."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I am a huge chef Sawyer fan! I made a visit to noodlecat at a few weeks ago and it was absolutely fantastic! Wings and fried chicken on the ramen were both fall off the bone tender, ramen was so flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the service was great! Sawyer was there when I made this trip, so that explains why the food was perfect! However, my food today was inedible and forever disappointing. The fried chicken on the ramen looked undercooked the first order and for the remade order. I was assured that it's actually \"over cooked\" during its cooking process. If that is the case, someone completely butchered the cooking process. It was NOT fall off the bone, it was quite rubbery and disgusting. The ramen was mushy and had zero flavor. No salt, no pepper, no flavor. My friend and I were so disappointed with today's visit because we were looking forward to it so much. Hope it improves..."}
{"text":"I really liked the meal I had here. Stopped in for a late lunch on a Thursday and basically had the place to ourselves.   The happy hour is awesome! It's from like 1pm-7pm or something crazy and they have a great special on the variety of buns. This is the first time I've seen such a big variety of buns. I would describe the options here as ramen-american fusion.   I had the sausage and fennel bun and it was really good. A little dry, but I got it without mayo so I imagine that problem isn't a factor when you get it with the mayo.   I took the recommendation of our server and had the fried chicken ramen and I loved it. Just the right amount of heat and really good breading and flavor. The ramen noodles were also cooked perfectly. My only complaint was that the broth was a tiny bit salty but I still really enjoyed it overall.   Now that I am back in Pittsburgh I am wishing Noodlecat was nearby because I know I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times in the last 6  months and I think I've found something to love at Noodlecat.  The steam buns are tasty powerful bites!  They are not very filling so I suggest you sample several.  It's amazing how much flavor can be packed into such a tiny size!    Try the Ohio Beef Burger and the Japanese Fried Chicken options."}
{"text":"The steam buns are so yummy! I like the in and out set up of the restaurant without feeling like I'm eating at McDonalds. The broth is yummy for most of the Ramen even though it tastes slightly different every day.    Pros: - Saki Menu - Steam buns - Daily sketches for specials  Cons: - Seating is a little annoying - Not enough Vegetarian options"}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"authentic\" Asian food, you can't quite find it here. However, I don't think anywhere in Cleveland has as great Asian fusion food as Noodlecat!   All of the dishes I've tried from them have had such rich flavors. They definitely leave me wanting for more :) One of my fave dishes from this place has got to be their pork belly buns! They are so delicious, and so cheap if you come during their happy hours (Sundays and weekday afternoons 4-6pm?)!! I also love their short rib ramen. The portion is humongous!! It was pretty much two dishes in one because I got a bowl of ramen noodles along with a side plate of Korean short ribs. YUMMY!!   My boyfriend is a huge fan of their kimchi salad, which I love as well! They put some crunchy onion things (not exactly sure what they are lol) in there, adding so much texture in a normally plain dish.   Servers are also very attentive, and they really try their best to explain to you the origin of each dish :)   Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Four star review with a few caveats. I love the flavors here, but there needs to be more broth in the bowls.  The selection is not the biggest in the world, but what is here is really good and I do recommend trying it. A fifth star would be easy to earn if they just added more broth in the noodle bowl, used real bowls, and added just a few more things to the menu. All in all this is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here a bit (10min) and 15 people have come in after us, but they are getting seated and waited on first.  It's not a big room, and the lady at the counter said they would be right with us when we walked in.  Been here 20 minutes and still waiting to speak with the first staff member.  The food looks great from what I see being delivered around us, but haven't tasted it ourselves; actually haven't even ordered yet.  Been here 35 minutes and the owner finally came and took our order.  Been here 40 minutes and the waiter finally stopped by to see if someone had come to take our order.  Been here 50 minutes and waiting on our food still; just 2 of us.  I am 100% certain others here are having a great time and a very different experience than we are.  I am almost certainly sure this place is fairly good and worth trying.  The atmosphere is sweet. Everyone seems friendly and the decor is fairly trendy.  Just wish it were quicker and first come first served.  They just closed the kitchen and won't let others in.  Been here an hour and still waiting.  Good thing this is a vacation day and we have time to kill.  Although, the seats are hard, metal, high-school science classroom stools with no backs.  We do have a flask of water at the table, and two glasses, but that didn't come till 40 minutes in.  Our glasses are empty and no refills yet.  60 minutes in and the owner just came and told us the food is coming, but it is going real slow in the back.  Our impression is they are under staffed.  They need a hostess to keep track of customers and maybe a bigger kitchen to get food prepared faster.  For a seating of 100 max, including outside seats, one server/busser, one bar tender, one cook and one owner is not enough for a Saturday game night.  70 minutes in and the same waiter/server/buser just stopped by to see if someone had taken our order...again, yes.  My bad, another waiter just brought me my order.  My brother's order is still M.I.A., but I'm sure it's on its way soon.  Oh, BTW, my steamed bun is cold and the bacon and burger are smaller than a half dollar.  But at least it only cost $6 ! (he says sarcastically).  The pork miso is good I hear from my bro. Give it a try, I'm sorta sure your experience will be heads above ours ... hopefully.  Wait, spoke too soon, they brought us the check for the table next to us.  I kinda feel sorry for the waiter/server/buser/host/... If not here, Potbelly down the road is delish."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try Noddle Cat and see another Cleveland local Jonathan Sawyer representing!  It was sadly disappointing. The tone was quickly set when we waited at the front for over 3 minutes before being told to 'sit wherever'.  It took us awhile to figure out how to order, but there is a clip board on the side of the table in which you just circle the type of noddles and flavoring you want. The waitress then came over took the papers without even asking if we had any questions.  The seating is very uncomfortable with just cold metal stools to sit on. As we waited for the food, I couldn't help but notice the rap music by nicki minaj was playing, it seemed they were mostly targeting young, hippsters being in the downtown area, I didn't like the music genera.   We had to take silverware from another table since there was none at ours. When the food arrived, it had a great presentation, but upon tasting it was very salty.  I had pork miso, but others at my table got theirs without miso, also stated the broth was salty. About 5 minutes in I needed more water to quench the saltiness but it took over 10 minutes for a waitress to even come by to get a refill. And they don't actually even refill it for you, your given a carafe to pour yourself. Some positives, the noddles tasted fresh, the pork in the soup was shredded nicely and I liked that they put a poached egg in the soup.  But the service was horrible! Sadly won't be returning here again, sorry Jonathan you need to get a better wait staff and actually taste your food."}
{"text":"Funny how a cat is the logo for this restaurant as it is more likely to attract cats than people. The ramen noodles aren't authentic and the the pork broth has shredded pork Inside that tasted more like mystery meat that's heavy and gives the broth an unappealing thickness and texture. It was really hard to get down. Here kitty kitty!"}
{"text":"Surprised with the wide ranging reviews of the new Noodlecat location in Crooker Park so I decided to give the place a try for myself. I never been to the downtown location and I can't give a compare / contrast on quality and service. First off the location is in a convenient location close to the open air lot by the movie theater and the other restaurant. The size of the restaurant seemed alright for a counter service bowl and bun establishment. The interior decor, noise level and feel is clean and comfortable but not a place I would plan on lingering around for more time than it takes to eat my meal.  I arrived at 12:30ish and was waited on immediately at the counter. The cashier was helpful in going over the options and I decided to have the Fried Chicken Ramen and a fountain drink totaling $14.45. My order was served up in just a few minutes. The ramen was good with a nice broth, decent amount of noodles and fried chicken leg on top of the bowl. While I enjoyed my dish, I began wondering if I would be happy dropping $14 for this lunch at a small family run restaurant without the celebrity chef name recognition. Final thoughts is Noodlecat is an other good option while at Crooker Park if you want something that is not a burger/fry place or sit down dinning."}
{"text":"The steamed buns and good service are the star attractions at Noodlecat.  We tried the Lake Erie Walleye, Japanese fried chicken, and Ohio CAB burger - all were outstanding.  From there we ordered two half bowls of ramen: smoked tomato coconut curry udon, and Dan Dan noodles with pulled pork.  They were okay, but neither provided the flavor punch we were expecting.  The broth of the first dish seemed to be missing tomato, coconut, and curry, while the Dan Dan noodles had good flavor but were a little greasy.  I'd go back, but would stick with appetizers."}
{"text":"We ordered one of everything off of the menu at Noodle Cat. There wasn't one thing I ate that night that was actually cooked properly. It was all terrible. I won't waste my time going into detail about the food because the owner/\"chef\" clearly doesn't care. If you're interested in ramen but have never experienced it please don't eat here and ruin it for yourself. If you have eaten authentic Japanese comfort food in the past you will be angered and you will be insulted. Cleveland deserves better."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was ok. I absolutely loved what I ordered - the pork with traditional ramen noodles. It is salty, just to warn you! But I happen to love salty things. I could have had an entire bowl of the broth alone and I would have been happy :) :) it happened to be empty when I came at lunch on a Monday. I had no trouble with the servers"}
{"text":"Wow . This review has been a long time in the making. Now I feel like I won't be doing it justice. Noodlecat is the first proper noodle house in Cleveland. It is still a bit trendy vs. traditional which is fine as that is what Cleveland needs and what Noodlecat needs to be able to stay in business.   Always ask for the specials when you visit. They tend to be inventive plays on some traditional meals. As a staple to fall back on the college ramen doesn't disappoint. Ramen noodles in delicious broth with pork, corn, and scallions. Simple and delicious. Steamed Buns are also on the menu! Little doughy sandwiches filled with any number of delicious ingredients. One of my favorites is the pork and pickles.   Their saki choices are good and diverse. I tend to stick with a junmai nigori (unfiltered and a bit sweet). Also, take a look at some of the special cocktails that the bar puts out.   IF you haven't tried it, you must. I will be a loyal customer for as long as it lives."}
{"text":"Outside of visiting the Christmas Story House, this was reason number 2 for my visit to Cleveland.  I freakin' love ramen and despite all my best efforts to give noodles up and go full on paleo I cannot quite give up ramen.  This was not as good as say Ren's Ramen in my area but I still ate every bit of the fairly massive bowl.  It was quite welcome on that cold, cold evening.  The service was a bit slow and the stuff that they didn't have was a little strange.  Once we were sat, there seemed to be confusion on which of the servers were responsible for our table.  However, once we did receive service, it was quick and we got our food fast.  My daughter needed a fork as she hasn't quite gotten her chopstick skills down and in what was a first for any of my dining experience, there was not a fork to be found.  She also wanted orange juice and that had been 86'd as well.  I would have like to have tried more on the menu but would perhaps do it at another less busy time, perhaps try an adult beverage or two."}
{"text":"Hands down the best noodle place in Cleveland!!! Amazing steamed buns. Hot, spicy and sweet. Funky cool atmosphere and the staff is tattooed and welcoming. Happy hour deals all week and amazing specialty cocktails. The stocks and broths they made are full of flavor and they cook a 6 minute egg perfectly. $-$$"}
{"text":"Freakin Amazing!!! Even though it's a bit of a drive for me, it's totally worth it!!! I love the open kitchen and the whole design of the restaurant. Staff was friendly and fast and helped my grandpa navigate the menu. It was awesome to see Chef Sawyer running around and helping his staff execute everything perfectly. I loved it here and so glad Noodlecat is back up and going. The pork miso is my favorite and the fried chicken steamed buns!!! I will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"So, the food was great, but the service was not so great.  We ordered and then waited over 25 minutes for our food to come out.  Really?  Two bowls of noodles and it takes that long?  No apologies from the server.  The portion size on the Dan/Dan - Udon Noodle combination was too small, I left the restaurant still hungry.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Noodlecat.   Meeeee-ow!   I'm not going to say I hated it. I'm not going to say I loved it. I'm just going to say it was alright.   We'll start with the ambiance -- to the person that said \"it makes Chipotle look trendy.\"  --  are you insane?! This place had great ambiance! Perhaps it was a *tiny bit* too dark in the back room near the bar. But otherwise? It looks like what I think a noodle joint is supposed to look like with a nice little modern/trendy twist. We didn't quite experience the communal seating because, I'll be honest,  the place was totally dead last Friday night.   On to the food -- I'm not a ramen snob. I've never even HAD true Japanese ramen and I'm not going to pretend to have actually had it just to make my review sound better and give me more hipster foodie street cred. However, I did go to Noodlecat with a girl who lives in NYC and has had great ramen there. (She was not very impressed with Noodlecat.)  But... I'm not so sure Chef Sawyer is really TRYING to replicate authentic Japanese ramen here so we'll just let that slide.  We started with 4 different appetizers: 2 flavors of chicken wings which were delicious (spicy stood out), octopus and bone marrow takoyaki and the sweet bread sweet breads. The last two were basically the same as they were both spherical pancakes. They just tasted like pancakes I make at home with a speck of fish flakes sprinkled on top.   Moving on to the ramen -- I have to say I was a bit disappointed to learn that they took the Tsukemen ramen off of the menu because.... (dun dun dun dun) Clevelanders weren't eating it properly and then coming to Yelp to write bad reviews. (LOLZ!!!!)  That sauce they served on the side? It's for DIPPING... not dumping into your bowl. So, I settled for the Hokkaido ramen. It was very flavorful and hearty. Noodles were great. I enjoyed this dish but it was almost too much. The broth was a bit too fatty and very rich. I tasted 4 different noodle dishes and they all seemed to be this way. Maybe that's how ramen is supposed to be? I dunno.   The service -- it was pretty stellar except that we really could have done without our server beating every explanation to death. It was almost like she wanted us to see how knowledgeable she was about ramen or that she had to impress us. Don't get me wrong...she was super sweet and did a great job overall. She was just TOO thorough or something. I hate to complain about that because it sounds absurd but it was really just TOO FREAKIN' thorough and she prattled on forever about traditions, the meanings of dishes, etc. We didn't really need to hear all of that. We just wanted to get our grub on. My cousin almost told her to shut up at one point.     Overall, I'd say that Noodlecat is possibly a bit too ambitious of a venture for Cleveland's first ramen joint. It was good and all but I honestly cannot say I'd be dying to get back asap."}
{"text":"After hearing about Noodlecat for some time, I finally stopped in on Tuesday evening.    My reaction is mixed, for one reason:  the waitress was downright weird.  OK, I know the bulk of my review should be based upon the food, and not the service.  The food itself was very tasty, which is why I gave a 3-star rating.  I'll talk about the food first, and the space cadet waitress second.  I ordered the half-sized Takahachi Ramen, which consisted of ramen, garlic pork broth, pork, scallions, crunchy garlic, a 6 minute egg, dashi and two pieces of nori.  The presentation was aesthetically pleasing, and looked delicious.  The noodles were cooked well, neither soggy nor crunchy; in my opinion they were perfectly cooked ramen noodles.  The pork was delicious, with the garlic flavor not overpowering at all.  I didn't find the broth to be greasy or oily in any way.  I have a medical condition which makes me very sensitive to oil/grease, and I was completely fine with the meal.  Everything about the ramen was pleasing, other than the small piece of eggshell I found in my soup.  While I'd have been happier without the eggshell surprise, it wasn't the end of the world.  Overall, my dinner was tasty and I felt a good deal for $6.  On to the service aspect of the dinner.  When we arrived the restaurant was pretty much empty.  I believe there were maybe 5 other patrons, mostly centered at the bar area.  My party of 4 (3 adults and 1 child) had no problem finding somewhere to sit.  The restaurant was very clean, including the bathroom, and somehow managed to feel cozy.  I liked the general atmosphere, except the waitress.  The waitress was weird.  Let me qualify that comment by saying I am the first to say being weird isn't a bad thing.  I'm weird, it's OK.  However, if your primary function at work is to interact with people, maybe you should actually BE ABLE to interact with people.  Eye contact?  Nope.  Speaking volume higher than a mumble?  Nope.  Coming across as though you're heavily medicated, or on illegal drugs?  Nailed that one!  When asked for the specials, our waitress mumbled something which sounded a little like specials, and more like she had no idea what she was talking about.  She was very awkward the entire time, and it was off-putting.  Let me say she WAS very attentive to water refills and removing empty dishes.  That certainly helped me look past her weird vibe, but it wasn't enough to completely excuse her demeanor.  And once we told her to give us a few minutes to decide on our dinners, she disappeared.  It was to the point where we were going to ask someone at the bar to take our order, when the waitress suddenly appeared to take our order.  Overall, I liked Noodlecat.  The food was good, general atmosphere was nice and I felt the prices were reasonable for what I received.  I will return to try out some of the steam buns.  Hopefully I have a different waitress."}
{"text":"Stopped in Cleveland and in Noodlecat - nice little spot, good decor, and the food was fun and reasonable. I had an assortment of buns (the butcher's with the pork side meat were standouts\" and some udon with egg. The food was tasty and pleasing, fresh tasting ingredients, and the service was fast and informed.  Good stuff, a nice find if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Noodlecat  For weekly Reviews like Cleveland Bites on Facebook!  So Cleveland for all its unique eating spots is sorely lacking in the ramen department... Or maybe I'm looking in the wrong spots, but it seems a few years ago James Beard Chef Jonathon Sawyer thought the same thing and Noodlecat was born.  Now Mr. Sawyer is well know for his emphasis on local food and doing things in house down to making his own vinegar. Noodlecat isn't an exception to these trademarks. As a Cleveland foodie Noodlecat has been on my radar for a long time, but being near downtown at lunch time just hasn't happened so this Saturday it was my destination stop for the day! We came in on a Saturday at 2pm and I must admit the place was dead, but then again everything around the 4th street district was dead. I guess Saturday doesn't draw a big lunch crowd downtown.  First thing I noticed was how dim this place was. We sat at the long bench tables in the back room by the bar and I have to comment that it was almost hard for me to even read the menu. Nothing was dirty, the table was wiped down and nothing was grimy to the touch, but the atmosphere made my mind jump to the word dingy. I'm not saying anything negative on the hygiene of the place because I saw nothing that made it seem dirty, but it was strangely dark inside. The menu is a fun little DIY Ramen maker. You choose a noodle, broth, veggies, and protein and get a custom bowl just for you!  They also have a selection of salads and steamed bun sandwiches to add as well. I got the crispy short rib with house ramen (a spaghetti style noodle) and my wife ordered the pork miso with udon (thick chewy noodles). We also ordered four of the steamed buns (bacon, fried chicken, tempura vegetable, lake perch). Everything came out quick and hot and I'll not hold anything back it was all amazing! The broth was deep and flavorful and the buns were each an interesting flavor profile. The service was attentive and friendly, our glasses were never empty and when I wanted a little spice to add to my bowl I was brought a cup of siracha and ghost pepper sauce. All in all I was highly impressed with the food like I've been every time I've ever been to one of Chef Sawyer's restaurants. The attention to detail and uniqueness in the menu is fantastic and if Cleveland is only going to have one legit ramen shop I'm glad this is it! But for the love of God turn up the house lights or something. Bill for 2 with water, two entrees, and four steamed buns was $35.  Atmosphere - ** Price -              *** Quality -          ***** Taste -             ***** Service -         ****  Good Points -Specials featuring interesting ramen flavors. -Build the ramen of your dreams.  Bad Points -May need. Flashlight to read your menu."}
{"text":"Back to update the review again. This is easily one of my favorite places to eat in all of Cleveland.   The J-chicken steam bun is without a doubt one of the best things I've ever eaten. Perfect mix of spicy, crispy, sweet. Amazing. The Ohio burger bun, not so much. Wasn't bad, just was kind of lackluster be comparison.   Favorite ramen: definitely the pork miso. I actually have to force myself to try different options because if I could I would have this every time I go (sometimes the urge is just too strong though). Close second is the college ramen. It's like a dressed up noodle cup (I mean that in the best way possible) with flavor on steroids. I thought I wouldn't like this because I spent my freshman year of college eaten instant ramen and cups of noodles and the ingredients sounded to similar, but it was great! Close third is the crispy short rib ramen. Got a little bit of a kick to it, great for a cold day when your sinuses could use a little help. The short ribs are delicious. The reason this dish doesn't rank higher is that I find the short ribs really difficult to eat. Since they're served bone-in, I end up making a mess, looking like an idiot, or not sure what to do with them. (I know someone out there is probably thinking \"stupid American, doesn't know how to eat short ribs\" and they're right! Someone teach me!) I have not yet tried the Spicy Dan-Dan noodles, but friends and family alike assure me that they are fantastic.  While you're there, also ask about their house sake. They usually have a different flavor for each month and it's almost always delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my family for lunch. After about 45 minutes the manager stop by to inform us that the server had not put our order in and our lunch was on the house. They were very apologetic and it is very nice that the bought lunch but the special day with my daughter and wife was ruined. Lastly I had to leave to go back to work and took my lunch to go. It was not what I had ordered. Will think twice about going here again."}
{"text":"meh...Cleveland needs to step their ramen game up.  I've been eating ramen most of my life coming from the San Francisco Bay Area. Ramen in the Bay is amazing. I've even had ramen in Japan and it tasted amazing as well. Not sure if this is suppose to be an american fusion version of ramen, but it has no familiar flavor of ramen I've ever had. Its plain and lacks any flavor. I couldn't even finish it. I guess if you've grown up in the Midwest you probably would like this.  Two stars for the 6min egg though and the service. I don't see myself ever returning next time I find myself in Cleveland.  Also they spelled okonomiyaki wrong. Its ONE word not Okonomi Yaki."}
{"text":"Noodlecat has the unfortunate advantage of being one of the sole ramen experiences in Cleveland. The joint looks like a winner, seems to have all the ingredients that would lead to success - the logo is adorable, service is not bad, and the menu items read appetizing and creative. But the nasty consequence of having no competition is just that - Noodlecat does not have to try. Marketing \"Asian fusion\" while serving instant noodles in bland, flavorless broth makes me question whether the chef understands what Asian fusion is - or if he has ever had real, authentic ramen to begin with.  You can't create a fusion restaurant without first understanding the authentic roots of the cuisine you serve. And Noodlecat is nowhere near where they need to be. I ordered the Crispy Short Rib Ramen. New experience: I didn't think it was possible to wash out the flavor of kimchi before trying this dish.   Ramen isn't about noodles so much as it is about broth, and this dark broth tasted like hot water - I had to ask the waitress for salt. Noodles were crimped and flavorless like instant noodles. The short ribs were tough, bland, and doused in a greasy sauce.   We also ordered pork steam buns - bun was wet and greasy, messy to eat. They spritzed our edamame with lemon and something else; a bold move, but it didn't do much for my palate.  Why is Noodlecat still around despite less than stellar food? Probably because they offer a cheap \"almost ramen\" to clientele that do not know better. I guarantee this place would not survive in a bigger city, where it would have to answer to competition, or at the very least, a more diverse population that won't stand for bland broth.   I really wanted to like Noodlecat as a native Clevelander, but until their chef gets it together, they are a no-go for me. It is unfair not to make an effort just  because you can. I hope in the future they'll do Cleveland justice and step it up."}
{"text":"What a cool little place. Local spin on traditional Japanese food.  Noodles (obviously), tempura, seaweed and beer (actually a full bar).  What's not to like?  Too bad there's not one nearby me....."}
{"text":"I went to the previous Noodlecat which was pretty good. This version is terrible. It looks the concept was changed to a ramen fast food style.  The bowls are fast food style containers instead of the typical ramen bowls. No broth spoons.  Both our orders were short on broth with the ratio of noodles to broth being off. Found a small bone in broth.   Noodles were fair. Meat was bland and not consistent with their previous offerings. Not the typical add on veggies, etc.  In summary, the newest version of Noodlecat is a major disappointment"}
{"text":"It's hard to describe how disappointing this place is. I got the Spicy Octopus bowl, which was WAY overpriced ($12.99) for how small the portion was. Additionally, the sauce was iffy and there was way too much of it. Maybe I'm not familiar with the type of dish, but it had a disgusting amount of sauce. The bowl upset my stomach, my girlfriend's stomach, and her friend's stomach, too. I can't emphasize enough how small the portions are for how expensive the prices are. Just get a 24-pack of Top Ramen for $2.50, find some octopus, and mix like 7 different sauces and call it a day. You'll get the same result but for cheaper."}
{"text":"We came here after the suggestion of a friend raving about the place. My boyfriend, the ramen snob, was not impressed. Personally, my kale, matzah and chicken broth ramen was the blandest thing I have ever tasted and made me feel sick to my stomach for the rest of the night. He had the pork ramen (overcompensate with crazy amounts of sodium) which also made him sick afterwards. Maybe we just had a bad evening with food, but this place was unimpressive with its alternative grunge décor and poorly seasoned dishes.   Steam buns were okay bur just a heads up, they aren't typical steam buns. Everything is cooked separately and the buns are a sort of English muffin style sandwich where you pick and choose toppings then seal the bun up to eat. Also unorthodox and unimpressive in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Overall Noodlecat is pretty good. A true fusion of Japanese with other cuisines such as ramen with marinated short ribs, a steamed bun with BBQ pulled pork, or a martini with a spicy house pickle juice and a ghost chili sauce. I had a traditional pork miso ramen with a kim chi salad. All tasty. Considering we had several in our group who've not had Japanese noodles before and enjoyed their meals says much about the food. The service was okay, but this where I had to knock it down one star. A friend ordered a glass of wine, but it took asking two-three times before finally it being served. Even if you give this a pass, the one conduct you can't is the server purposely deceiving us. We had arrived at the start of their happy hour where discounts are provided on certain meals, appetizers, and drinks. We asked about the happy hour, but our server answered, \"Not here\". It wasn't until we left that we saw the street board out front that said they have happy hour, but was only served in the outdoor patio area or at the bar. We were seated at a table. Very bad business practice"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Very short tables and uncomfortable stools. Very over priced and wasn't very tasteful. Only good part was the beer selection and the steam buns. Would be better if it was a bar serving bar food. Pretty good happy hour. Not a dinner place."}
{"text":"The homemade noodles are fantastic!  Sweet location and atmosphere.  I had the pork ramen and it was delicious!  Great service as well."}
{"text":"It was funny that I heard Noodlecat mentioned on \"Modern Family\" after I came home from eating there.  They seem to be local to Ohio so it might be some other chain.  I went there during happy hour and tried just about all the items on their happy hour menu:  Steam Buns:  *** Sake Cocktail:  ** Takahachi Ramen:  **** Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun:  ** Service:  **** Ambiance:  **  The service was decent when I went but, like some other reviewers, I wasn't a big fan of the low tables.  All-in-all a good price for what I got.  I would go back.  But there are better places nearby."}
{"text":"I have grown to love this place. My first time was the week it opened. It was good but I didn't need to go all the time....FWD to this last week and I was there to eat to to grab take-out 3 times! Addict to say the least.  Happy Hour you can't beat. 2/$5 steamed buns (they recently changed the price) and $5 noodle bowls with drink specials galore.  Noodle Bowls: the Miso Ramen, Szechuan (if you like hot it's sooo good) Ramen and Tempura Soba Dori are my fav's for dinner. For lunch the Crispy Beef Short Rib and \"Roscoe's\" Fried Chicken & Ramen are amazing.  Buns: I do the Pickle bun and Turkey a lot but the Burger and Pulled Pork annnnd the Butcher's Bun are great. Obviously you can't go wrong. (Please do yourself a favor and add the red sauce provided at your table - I think you can buy it at the WSM I think - delicious)  Last week I tried the \"Super\" Salad. Then got it to go 2 days later. It's a kale salad with beans, dry blueberry, green tea granola and grains but so good!  I could live off of this place. So go and try it more than once and I'm sure you will find your favorites!"}
{"text":"Visited the first time towards the end of December 2012.  What can I say....  First, I don't hate this place.  Nice hip interior and friendly servers.  Based upon the reviews here and pictures posted, I tried 2 different kinds of buns and Takahachi ramen.  I would give them a credit for buns.  One of them was tonkatsu, which was not notably impressive but the other one, butcher's bun, was exceptionally good, at least to me.  Very good idea and tasty topping.  It will be worth trying definitely.    Sadly, Takahachi ramen was just awful.  I completely agree with Michael W. from CA review.  Although the ramen bowl looks great, the broth was completely tasteless.  I am a native Japanese who knows about ramen noodle very well, probably more than anyone else in the neighborhood.  This was a total degrading and disrespecting the name of ramen.  I am sorry to say but if someone highly talks about this Takahachi ramen, I will need to question his/her sense of taste.  The word Takahachi alone does not make a lot sense.  It could be Takahashi or something else.  I was totally disgusted by this ramen.  I even had to ask the server if this was how it's been made and I was told 'yes'.... Really.    There are other noodle dishes on the menu and I really should not make a harsh judgement against Takahachi ramen but if it is truly how they make and serve, then it has to be corrected.  I am not sure whether or not Noodlecat tries to reproduce the real Japanese style ramen noodle.  If they seriously are proud of what they call ramen, they at least need to visit Ippudo in NYC. Shinano of Solon OH is an authentic Japanese restaurant and their ramen is far better than Takahachi ramen.  Shinano does not specialize in ramen but their soup is tasty and flavorful."}
{"text":"We went here with high expectations since eating at their sister restaurants a few times, it failed miserably.   Lets start with the staff having to be told to wipe down tables filled with food pieces etc.   We got the udon noodles with cauliflower curry and added chicken. The broth was tepid temperature at best, very few  pieces of cauliflower, but the worst was the addition of the chicken...HORRIBLE PRODUCT. It cost an additional $5.00 and basically was 4 sliver sized pieces of this horribly breaded chicken that was cold, the meat didn't even taste like chicken, it was tough and the breading was BAD.   While we ate there two additional customers asked for refunds, the two members of the staff we engaged with were not the most knowledgable of their products.   Foodies that know good pho, save yourself a trip."}
{"text":"I LOVED noodlecat when it  was downtown so I was really excited when it came to Crocker park. I was terribly disappointed. There is no ambiance at all to the restaurant. You are served on paper plates with plastic ware, like a fast food restaurant but 4x the price. I got the steamed bun combo. The steamed buns were delicious as always but the ONLY drink options is the soda fountain. They don't even have an iced tea (brisk doesn't count). A really expensive and unhealthy lunch. Never again."}
{"text":"Looking for subpar ramen and slow/poor service? Look no further than Noodle Cat. What they lack in flavor they make up in the simple fact they exist in Cleveland. Is it great a ramen place is in downtown? Yes. Is it good? No. Does it have some flavor? Kind of. Did it fill me up? Yes.  Bottom line is this place did the job but not super well. Better service wouldn't been a helpful touch."}
{"text":"While I love the brick-and-mortar noodle shop, the stand at WSM is not super consistent. I've gone a lot over the last 3 years since I work and play in the area often. The steam buns are usually a solid choice, I've never had one I didn't like. But the noodles, the most important part since the place is called Noodlecat, leave a lot to be desired. Most of the times I've gone I've enjoyed the noodles but I've never been particularly thrilled with any of them.   Last summer I worked near Tower City so I started frequenting the actual restaurant and realized the stand at WSM was doing them a big injustice. The noodles were consistently flavorful and exciting to eat.  This past weekend I went--it was a Saturday--and I got the dan dan ramen hoping to satiate my mega craving after having practically inhaled the same dish at the Euclid location days before.   When I got it the noodles were not the same kind of noodles that were in the dish when I first tried it and it was covered in nuts which was not on the dish when I ordered it at the Euclid location either. I shrugged it off and took a bite. While it was delicious I was confused because it tasted almost nothing like the dish I thought I was getting.   So bottom line, if you are looking for some decent noodles, you can find them here but if you want the real noodle cat experience the restaurant will be a better experience all around since there is a lack of consistency between  the food at the stand and the restaurant."}
{"text":"Despite my review of the WSM location I absolutely love this place!!!  I've had the dan dan ramen, the spicy octopus udon, the chicken and ramen, etc. and they are all delicious. The Spicy Udon is my favorite! The buns are always good I've had a ton of different ones and have loved them all. My mom even loves this place and she's not a huge fan of noodle places.   The waitstaff if always super helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, they are willing to give suggestions and clearly enjoy the food they serve which is a big plus. The vibe of the restaurant is really chill there is always something random on the TVs at lunch like soaps or cartoon network. Its a casual place but often at lunchtime you'll see suits there at the bar getting noodles it's definitely a diverse crowd.  If you like great beer and great crappy beer a like they've got a really diverse selection and they also have quite a few types of sake as well.   You can definitely spend some cash here, but if you're on a budget like I am you can grab a Black Label and a half order of noodles for 10 bucks or less. I can't say enough about this place, I've never had a bad experience whether dining alone or with friends. My favorite is to stop in for a quick bite at the bar during lunch time."}
{"text":"The food is really Americanized Japanese. The noodle bowl I got was very mediocre. I am willing to try it again and try other options to see if they are any better."}
{"text":"Poorly prepared food and poor service are the hallmark of this establishment. My dish came out with just noodles, poorly cooked, without any of the stuff it was supposed to come with.  15 minutes later the rest arrived without explanation or apology.  Unbelievably rude when I asked about it.   Unworthy of the proprietor."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar waiting for my take out order I had to listen to the bartender pontificate how she hated the people here for the debate the previous night.  If I want my server's politics I'll ask for it.  Service was less than attentive with a healthy dose of attitude."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and I adore their food. Typically my husband and I order at least one of the specials, and they are always interesting and tasty. All of our servers have been pleasant and good at what they do.   I feel bad that I'm finally writing a review but only because we had one bad thing happen today. The host brought us back to the very last table at the back of the restaurant -- ok, my husband and I aren't that pretty. But when I asked if we could sit up front at the window (there were plenty of empty tables), the host was visibly angry as he seated us. Later, after we had a really nice lunch, my husband said thank you to the host, who looked at him and turned away without saying a word. Jeez, somebody needs to go into another line of work."}
{"text":"Outrageously overpriced and disappointing food. Noodlecat's food has gone downhill since closing their Westside Market location. I ordered the 2 steam bun meal and was very disappointed by the price ($9.99), the quantity, and the quality of the food. The steam buns have shrunk to about half their size. All the steam buns now come with the same genetic toppings just like a hamburger -- lettuce, tomato, pickle, and ketchup -- there was a time when the company had better taste and creativity. Finally, I thought shoestring French fries were disgusting, but noodlecat has dentalfloss fries -- greasy strings supposedly made from potatoes."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. This ramen is truly terrible. Worse than microwaving Maruchan at home. It is about as expensive as you'd expect good Ramen to be. The pork belly was salty. The boba was worse than the Ramen."}
{"text":"I felt a little bamboozled by Noodlecat and their Asian-themed noodle bowls because none of the flavors were similar to the actual tastes they seemed to be advertising. I had a ramen craving that I was looking to extinguish and came here with another like-minded friend.   My skepticism began when I walked inside and saw several bored looking employees around the dining area, which consists of several communal tables with metal stools. The menu items all seemed to be caricatures of Asian fusion dishes, and normally I'm all for fusion, but there's a point where you can't really claim that it still has those ethnic roots. We ordered the Nama Ramen with Crispy Beef Short Rib and House Ramen with Pork Miso, plus a Fresh Bacon Bun and Tempura Perch Bun.   It was a resounding \"Meh\". I couldn't really tell what sort of aromas were hitting my tongue and nose other than salt, salt, salt. I like a rich pork miso broth, but sipping the House Ramen soup was like drinking butter - and the fat droplets were congealing before I even took my leftovers home (the fact that I had leftover ramen tells you something). My friend enjoyed his Nama Ramen a bit more, mostly because the short rib was done well. The Bacon Bun was satisfying (can't say no to pork belly), but the tempura-ed fish didn't taste very fresh at all.   Even if I came not expecting ramen, I don't think I got a $10-valued noodle bowl. No amount of hipster furniture or refills of tiny water glasses is going to make up for that. I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that there might be other better items on the menu, but personally I will save myself the sodium bloat for another place."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome place. The Kale salad was one of the best salads of my life! Food was fresh and hot. The only reason it's 4 and not 5 stars was our waitress. Will totally be back though"}
{"text":"Noodlecat is great for a bowl of hot soup on a cold Cleveland day. It is a little pricy ($11 for basic chicken ramen), but it is delicious. The service has been slow on a few of my visits, but overall, I really enjoy lunch here every few weeks. They do have gluten free rice noodles (make sure to ask specifically for those, as their house noodles are not GF), and the college chicken broth is GF."}
{"text":"I don't know what restaurant the negative reviewers went to. We have been to Noodlecat several times and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. The steam buns are the star and are priced right at Happy Hour for $2 each. Red Stripe is $1 at Happy Hour. The servers check on us frequently and clearly enjoy working there."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place bc I love ramen. Sadly disappointed. I ordered the curry tofu with the house ramen (they we're out of the traditional ramen :( )and the perch bun.   The bun was good, the curry \"broth\" was good, the tofu was bland, the house noodles had to of been spaghetti noodles straight out of the box.   Do not plan on going again, unless the food gets better bc it is a good concept."}
{"text":"I heard Noodle Cat was good, and I love ramen. Unfortunately I was really disappointed in my experience, and it was my night to pick the restaurant we went to (oops). My portion size was solid but my boyfriend's was tiny. The noodles in his (the fried chicken noodle bowl) had a really undercooked consistency, and the chicken was half gristle. The broth was bland in both of ours, but mine was only slightly better after adding sriracha (I had the pulled pork bowl). The broth was being poured out of a pail in the kitchen? Didn't seem very appetizing. I'm not sure if that's standard? The small fountain drinks were also almost $3 each! Yikes!! For a $24 meal for two, definitely disappointing. We didn't finish our food and left to go get froyo instead."}
{"text":"Something happened. Noodlecat is all together different. The chicken in the japenese fried chicken steam bun was wayyyy overcooked and the meat itself seemed totally different than before. The noodles suck now...the Dan Dan was missing something.. can't quite put my finger on it but, it's not the same. Please bring the old nooodlecat and please, for the love of God, put backs on your chairs. I don't want to eat mediocre food on a hard stool."}
{"text":"First time I ate here a few years back it was excellent. I have ate here once or twice a year since it's been open, and it gets worse every time.   I got 4 steam buns for lunch today, 3 veggie and 1 fish. The veggie burger one was the only one that had a sauce on it, the rest were just some veggies/fish (got the pickled, tempura, & fish) slapped on the bun with one leaf of lettuce and a 1/4 slice tomato. Just super dry and disappointing. Bums me out because this place has so much potential to be an awesome spot, like the other Sawyer restaurants.  The atmosphere at Roxu in Lakewood sucks, but their buns are way better and half the price (2 for $3 I think)."}
{"text":"It's weird going from the old Noodlecat downtown to this one. The vibe is totally different. I got my regular order-- Japanese fried chicken steam buns and the Dan Dan. They added tofu to the Dan Dan (which I hate) so I ordered it without it and it was pretty good! Not sure what happened to the steam buns though. They used to be so succulent and juicy and now they are just dry and sorry. Its a good place to order to go or if you are in the mood for almost a cafeteria style dining experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been going to Noodlecat for years. We visited the new Westlake location and, much to our dismay, we were very disappointed. The integrity of each dish has been noticeably compromised. Unfortunately will not be returning, and will be mourning the loss of old Noodlecat."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and I thought this place looked promising so I went and sat at the bar. I ordered a bacon steamed bun, which was delicious, and the coconut curry tonkatsu with house ramen. The \"kimchi\" in the soup appeared to be just chopped plain bok choy. The soup was really bland and disappointing. I had to douse it with hot sauce to make it edible.   The bartender was brusk and I felt like I was bothering him.   I like the idea of the place. If I have more time in Cleveland I might give it another try."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner. Interesting concept, but in my opinion it doesn't quite come through. I had the Japanese fried chicken dinner, which sounded very tasty, but didn't quite taste too much different than any well-cooked fried chicken you could get elsewhere for much cheaper. I also tried the pork sausage, and fresh summer tomato steam buns, which were promising, but probably could have been a bit more filled to bring out more of the flavors."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a shot and boy was I disappointed. I tried the Kimchi Ramen and I couldn't even eat it. I love Kimchi, and this was not even close. The broth tasted like someone took a jar of Kimchi and washed it out. The noodles were lack luster and it was just all around awful.   I have been to Korea and Japan and the food here just feels so far off from the actual Asian flavors.   Maybe Noodle Cat has some tasty stuff, but I'm not going to run a flavor/cost gauntlet just to find one good item. :("}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for seven years and was highly disappointed with Noodle Cat. I was not expecting them to be spot on with the Japanese food but what I got was down right awful.   The broth tasted like soy sauce and salt. The second item was also very salty. It just tasted nasty.  While I was there several other tables complained about the taste of the food. I will not be going back or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic inventive noodle dishes.  I had some sort of daily special that definitely combined unique flavors.  Perfect for a cold winter day.   Service was both pleasant and prompt.  For what you pay, one of the better values in downtown."}
{"text":"mmmmmmm noodles. noodles are my favorite. i love this place. i love their happy hour especially, which i think is the only time i've been there. love the half portions, since it just means i can get more options from the menu. i love them for the vegetarian menu. the noodles are perfectly chewy. the soups are tasty. the buns with the pickled vegetables - mmmmm perfect sweet picklyness. the chilled sake is delicious. they are quite a bit pricey for noodles i will say, need to knock down everything like three bucks and i'd be there every day. and i'll agree with my friend's suggestion that they need to change their bowls. the big wide bowls are not conducive to soup noodle eating. also, their service at the bar really needs an upgrade during happy hour. it is so busy bc the one bartender not only makes drinks for the entire restaurant, but is also the waitress for everyone at the bar. i always sit at the bar, which means service is pretty slow and i have to wave her down to get anything. they need another person back there!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm surprised at all the terrible reviews of this place. Sounds like they got off to a pretty rocky start. This place is definitely not the same noodle cat that was downtown but that doesn't mean it can't be good. As far as being cramped, honestly it's not that much smaller than downtown location. The high ceilings and bright lights are actually pretty nice. Some reviews said they were still hungry after their meal but my bowl came with a lot of noodles and everyone else around me appeared to also have overflowing bowls. Some reviews complained about it being dirty, but I didn't see anything terrible. Most tables were cleaned up in a reasonable time, didn't see any trash lying around for too long. Paper bowls and Chipotle style, yeah so what? Don't come here expecting fine dining. As for the food itself, I got the spicy vegan Dan Dan noodles, with extra vegan broth. Also got extra extra broth bc the Dan Dan sauce was too spicy for me! I'm pretty wimpy with spicy though. Was not charged for any of the extra broth. It was very flavorful, full of tofu and noodles. A little bit of the oily side but definitely delicious. They didn't have vegan broth written on their menu though but did tell me about it when I asked. Would definitely be helpful if it was actually on the menu for vegans and vegetarians looking at their menu online who are deciding if they want to come here or not  So hopefully they are working out the rough start but would definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere are great but when it comes to the food it's average. The old school salad had a real oily ginger dressing drenched over it. The noodles were starchy yet the spicy octopus stir fry had lots of flavor and spice! The pork miso was a little bland but overall satisfying. All in all it was a nice experience but wouldn't spend the money again to dine here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the house ramen. Also had the steamed pork bun. Great happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Quick update: In subsequent visits to Noodlecat since my prior review, they seem to have eased back on the salt in the dishes a bit, and in my opinion have hit a sweet spot with their flavors. My wife, my kids, and I all love this place and find ourselves continuing to go back! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Ramen Restaurant in Cleveland.... The food is delicious and the staff is amazing. I really enjoy their spicy octopus ramen and the steamed buns are fucking amazing!!!! So good. I have tried pretty much everything on their menu and all of the foods give you a different feeling and a different emotion... It is nice... It shows that they care about their food. I would recommend this place to anyone and now we even are starting a monthly Noodlecat Night!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try the place when it (re)opened in Westlake.  The result was highly anticlimactic.  I had the pork miso ramen with an egg and a small beverage.  I was shocked when the cashier asked me for $17.69.  I could get 62 packs of Maruchan for that!  The food came out, and my bowl was barely half full of broth, noodles, etc.  If you don't want to serve a full bowl that size, order a different size bowl.  I'm sure Sysco Foods has a bowl available in any size you want.  Don't give me a giant bowl with a little soup.  Give me a smaller bowl filled to the rim.  I felt cheated.  I dove into the egg, which was possibly the thing I anticipated most, and it was.... (drum roll...) hard boiled - no runny center oozing through my soup - SO SAD.  On to the soup.  The noodles were cooked just right and had a nice chew, but the broth was watery and flavorless - no sticky glaze on my lips, no briny tang.  I'm not looking for the salt-lick that comes in the package, but a little seasoning of some kind might have helped. I got about a tablespoon of pork in my soup.  The good news is, I didn't need any more.  It was bland and mushy.    There were no accompaniments to add to bring it to life - Sriracha, fish sauce, soy, or hoisin or any number of other things could have saved the day, but they were all absent.  If you want to serve simple food for a premium price, you have to GET IT RIGHT.  I suggest you go back to the drawing board, or adjust the price to reflect perfect mediocrity.  I will likely give them another try some time in the future, but not for a while.  Good luck Noodle Cat."}
{"text":"Another great experience.  We went last night before a show at Playhouse Square.    It was our server's first day but you'd never know it.  She was great with us and did a great job with her other diners.  The food was exceptional as usual.  Gave us the energy to make for an easy stroll up Euclid to the show."}
{"text":"Was walking by and I knew their happy hour started at 3, so I figured I would pop in and try it. I knew nothing about noodle cat or what to expect. I went straight to bar, bartender was busy telling a story to a server and completely ignored me. When she finally did come over I asked for a happy hour menu, she rambled off stuff so fast I had no idea what she said.   I ended up ordering the pork miso ramen off her recommendation. It was good, but as other people have posted, nothing spectacular. It is worth the price being only $5 dollars on happy hour. It was also filling. For being a half order I can't imagine how big a full order is! The food came out quickly. They expect you to grab your own napkin, chopsticks, and spoon from a \"community pot\" which I didn't realize at first... (The napkins were so cheap, they sucked!!!! ) If you don't know how to use chopsticks, I think you may be SOL because I didn't see any silverware. Halfway through my meal I ordered 2 steam  buns. I didn't know what they were and asked bartender to explain them. She really didn't know how to explain them. Basically they were like mini sandwiches... I got the Japanese fried chicken and the turkey. Both were impressive! However the chicken bun was quite messy and sticky and the cheap napkins did nothing to help me clean my hands...... Seriously Sawyer, invest in some real napkins....   All in all the meal wasn't bad. I couldn't imagine paying full price for it though. I may stop back for happy hour when passing by again, but I wouldn't recommend it.   Overall I wasn't impressed for being a Jonathan Sawyer restaurant."}
{"text":"I had to rate this five stars to bring up the average based solely upon two smug Nipponophiles who rated Noodlecat based upon how closely its ramen dishes mirror Japan's.  I too lived in Japan, and grew to adore all things ramen.  The other two reviewers have forgotten a singularly important fact about ramen: each city, community, and even neighborhood has its own version of this dish.  Here is why Noodlecat should have a revered place in Yokohama's Ramen museum: They are not trying to duplicate Japan Ramen.  They have created their own variety.  The American culture clearly comes through in the flavor of their broth, which others have panned here as lackluster.  In fact, it is full of goodness, if you know why it's there.  When I saw them using shredded pork and greens, I immediately remembered growing up in the South.  I at pork and greens enough to know what the pot liquor tastes like, and that is what the broth at NoodleCat seems to have as its base.  It pays great homage to Japanese Ramen by doing exactly what the Japanese have honed to perfection:borrowing things from other cultures and making them uniquely their own.  The perfect example of this is Ramen itself, borrowed from the Chinese and modified, the dish is now so indelibly Japanese that to spell Ramen with katakana is almost silly.  Noodlecat turns that tradition right around.  It's not Japanese Ramen.  It's American Ramen, and I'm a fan.    I am still looking for a place stateside that serves Japan Ramen even half as well as some of the track-side vendors in Japan, but this place has won my heart by doing their thing their own way.  Stop hatin', and enjoy the noodles!"}
{"text":"Big fan of noodles and noodle bars so I thought I'd try them out. I ordered the fried chicken bowl.  Broth was already cold by the time I got home( I live down the street) and wasn't very good. the noodles were still stuck together which means they weren't prepared right. The chicken was soggy and is a very tiny proportion for a 10$ meal. I don't leave reviews at all but I was so disappointed I was forced to. Won't be visiting against"}
{"text":"Noodles were horrible. Was expecting traditional Japanese ramen noodles but was served Giant Eagle brand spaghetti in beef broth. Service was also very slowwww. Ten tables in the main room and only one group with food. Arrived with high expectation and leaving very let down."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my manfriend before a stroll around Crocker. First, let me tell you that two (2!) bowls of ramen, two drinks and a side a brussel sprouts cost over $40!!! We ordered the fried chicken bowl, not having been here before and receiving no explanation of the dish, we assumed we were getting chicken breasts of some fried sort in the ramen. This was not the case. It is literally a drum stick of chicken on top of your ramen. Ours unfortunately, were both not cooked fully and were pink inside. Also, when adding the egg to the ramen, we expected a type of scrambled egg...what you receive is an undercooked soft-boiled egg. When we alerted the staff that our chicken was undercooked, no one came to our table to address the issue. So go ahead and save your money. This isn't worth $2."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant in Cleveland however that was 3 menus ago. Every time I revisit they take away my favorite options and replace them with options that seem less fresh, flavorful and creative. Their saving grace is their steamed buns which unfortunately won't be enough to get me through the door again. I'll have to wait for menu 5.0."}
{"text":"Wow. 2 people. $50. And I could have made a better meal from the local dollar store. Nope nope nope. Stay away. Will not return. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I went to West Side Market in January when it was VERY cold... after walking by Noodle cat, a steamy hot bowl of ramen sounded perfect.  They were sold out of the miso ramen so I decided to try the spicy tofu udon.  The noodles were good, I believe they were from Ohio City Pasta.  The actual soup itself was nothing special.  Not very spicy and very vinegary.  It lacked your typical Asian flavors.  I was disappointed because I had heard a lot of good things about this place.  The West Side Market is foodie heaven and in my opinion, you're better off going elsewhere instead of this place if you're looking for a bite to eat.  Kudos though to the guy working there.  He was very friendly."}
{"text":"Welp Yelp, I can finally say I tried the elusive Noodlecat. I have been back-and-forth on whether or not to get food from here for a while now, mainly because of my fellow Yelpers inability to decide whether or not this place is awesome or sucks. The reviews are so all over the place I wasn't sure if I really wanted to subject myself to the possibility of a bad meal. I decided once and for all the bite the bullet though and check this place out for myself.   Overall, I'm not super impressed. The location, servers, and vibe were a+, no complaints there, but the food was just lacking for me. Considering the price as well as the hype, I expected a pretty tasty dish when I ordered the smoked tomato coconut curry udon, instead though I got some pretty slimy noodles.  The broth was good but overall could have used a bit more body, and the tofu was a pretty pointless addition to the dish. I wish they had gotten a little more creative with it. Just because I'm vegan doesn't mean I like huge chunks of tofu in my soup!  The house sake was good though, it was infused with orange and lemon and I could have drank a barrel of it. It was just what I wanted while sitting outside in the late summer sun.   Overall, I vote skip Noodlecat. It just didn't impress me enough to feel the need to recommend it to anyone or bother going back."}
{"text":"I finally made it out to Noodlecat (please don't tell Superior Pho!) and I'm a fan.  Whereas, places like Superior Pho are like the dark-haired beautiful girl straight off the boat from Vietnam, Noddlecat is the Hapa girl, with her hair dyed red, blue, and white, and maybe a nose ring.  She's hip, she's cool, and she got flava! :0      We stroll in there, pushing our sleek red stroller and we are greeted by loud rock n' roll.  \"Table for two, and a baby,\" I say.  \"This way, please.\"  That's the reply I get and no raised eyebrows, no batted eyelids, and would you know it, there's already a seated family with their own baby holding court at the end of the table.  Yes, parents are hip too.  Giving birth doesn't mean I have to hide away for the next 10 years!    What about the food?!, I hear you screaming.  Well, pipe down and let me tell ya.  The food was delish! I got the duck confit noodle soup, full bowl, thank you. And some gyoza as appetizer.  My husband got the baby octopus noodles, and some fried chicken buns.  My duck soup was delicious!  The duck meat fell off the bone in velvety bites, and the soup was dark and thick, like any good soup should be.  My husband's octopus noodles were nicely spicy, with some bright crunchy vegetables thrown in for good measure.  He regretted having only ordered the halfl bowl.  And what about the baby you ask?  Well, she sat in her high chair, sucked down her bottle and bobbed her head back and forth, rocking out to the good ole American music being piped into the room. The verdict: we liked it, and so did the baby.  With flavorful food, Tom Petty, The Beatles, and the Rolling Stones on rotation, what's not to love?  P.S.:  The one star off was for the prices! $11 for a bowl of noddles. But we understand that they are paying downtown rent and we will most likely be back!"}
{"text":"I expected too much, but after reading the menu, I already knew it was going to be a bad experience.  Once you start seeing the words, butabara, tonkatsu, and miso, you'll know you're going to be in for a treat.  I guess the almost 4 star rating threw me off.  Service was very slow.  Udon was barely warm. The 6 minute egg however, was actually cold.  My wife's ramen wasn't very good either. Clumpy noodles.  Both soups lacked flavor and heat, you're traditionally supposed to slurp the stuff...  It's definitely not authentic ramen."}
{"text":"Before taking a recent weekend trip to Cleveland we scoped this place out based on the reviews. We were not disappointed. Everyone loved everything they got. The spicy octopus stir fry was tasty and delicious - and the perfect portion. The chilled seaweed soba salad was a nice twist to the traditional seaweed salad - a good portion too. The Japanese fried chicken bun was very tasty - would definitely get the whole portion sometime! They also had Dogfish on tap - so that was an awesome surprise!"}
{"text":"This was a OK place to eat. This ramen was definitely not a traditional japanese recipe, more american (aka not as good). The pork in the dish was not a traditional slice of pork, it was more pulled pork or brisket like. What was gross is that you could see the veins and cartilage in the pork - yucky to look at when your enjoying something. lastly the pork buns were completely STALE! How can you make pork buns with a horrible bun! They felt like sandpaper and dried out bread. I wish I got my money back."}
{"text":"It's the most disgusting ramen I ever ate. We ordered ramen and udon, both were terrible. The udon was not real udon, and the ramen soup is so oily and taste awful. Definitely avoid this restaurant. It's the worst noodle restaurant I even been to. $13 per dish is not expensive, but for this quality, it's way too expensive. it's worth only $1 dollar."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I almost had the perfect meal last night at Noodlecat. I have been talking about this place for months, and I knew she would just love it because of the time she spent in Japan. It was a bitter, cold night in downtown Cleveland, so all the pieces were in place to slurp up some delightful food on a quiet Sunday evening. We started off with the Porky Garlic Twice Cooked Crispy Chicken Wings and the Tsukemono Pickle Sampler. These were both fantastic choices, and I would have walked out happy if we had just tried these two things, but we went on to order the Pork Miso Ramen and the Crispy Beef Short Rib Char Sui. We felt like we had hit some Cleveland dinner lottery as we enjoyed both of these dishes. (Seriously...who needs Megamillions when you are stuffing your mouth with amazing food?)  We were literally singing our own praises as if we had cooked the meal instead of just deciding what delicious things to choose from the menu. The 21st Amendment Fireside Chat on draft may have aided in my overall glee, but I can assure you, this dinner was spectacular. What wasn't so spectacular, however, was the countless number of splinters that came out of the wood bench, and entered my girlfriend's tights and then thighs as she went to slide out from behind the table when we were done with our meal. The pain she was quickly in, coupled with the ruined tights, still wasn't enough to completely tarnish the amazing meal we had (at least not for me), but next time, we will probably make sure the benches are sanded down a little better before settling in to stuff our faces. Overall, I will give this meal 4 splinters out of 5."}
{"text":"I've visited the West Side Market stall twice now.  One cool thing is that they have daily \"Butcher\" specials utilizing items from WSM vendors.  First time had steamed bun \"sandwiches\".  Tasty, but I think on the pricey side (as they're rather small).  My butcher bun had a slab of thick bacon from Whittaker's.  That's a huge plus, until you realize it's unappetizingly undercooked...  On the next visit, I ordered the butcher noodles, featuring andouille sausage (ok, if it has bacon or andouille, I'm likely to order it!).  Good stuff.  Portion is almost a full quart.  Plenty of meat & noodles.  I thought the broth was tasty, but a little diluted- tasting (maybe they figure everyone punches it up with soy or hot sauce?).  Altogether, a solid lunch.  Seating consists of a \"bench\" on the north side if the building; on a nice day, it'll do.    I'll be back for another container of slurpy noodle goodness.    I've made a mental note to hit the Euclid Ave. location sometime."}
{"text":"I moved downtown recently & have yet to buy groceries so I am making a dent on the Cleveland food scene these days, lucky me! I wanted to get takeout tonight and called down to Noodlecat and ordered the combination with the super salad and half pork miso ramen bowl ($10). I really enjoyed the salad and was able to save half of it for lunch tomorrow - I didn't even know I liked kale!. My bowl was just too salty for me (my friends would not believe that I could say that) and there wasn't much pork or any vegetables - just salty mushy noodles. Kudos on the service and again the salad was good but I won't order a bowl again."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch but all I remember was that the noodle is not done.. they're not cooked well and are still hard.. I mean, my friend and I weren't in a hurry, so I had no clue why they were not done properly.. Seriously, even I could make better noodle than they did..   The soup was ordinary, nothing special. It's not like super salty like those traditional japanese soups, but my boyfriend's noodle soup has no taste.. so I guess that's a bit too extreme... Not going back there if I ever go to Cleveland again :P"}
{"text":"This place isn't your ordinary \"Japanese\" noodle place. Their logo, atmosphere & everything else tells you it's Japanese, BUT their food. I usually don't review businesses after 1 visit, but it's unfortunate to say that I will never go back there. I also don't think I'd be so disappointed if the prices weren't so high.  Gotta hand it to them for innovative food & the effort in keeping their ingredients local, but man... \"taste\" is the missing link. My friend & I ordered Takahachi Ramen, BBQ Ohio Port bun, & Chicken Yakitori. Takahachi Ramen was lukewarm, tasteless and had no broth. The buns were definitely alot better.   It's so unfortunate that the waiters never told us about the all day Sunday happy hour special. We would've ordered more of little things to sample.  They should also reconsider different type of glasses for their sakes because stemless wine glasses extenuates the smell of the liquor so it's a little hard to drink."}
{"text":"Average Decor but really good food.  They had bun things that were kind of like tacos that were awesome.  really everything was very good.  I wish the decor was better.  Kind of dark.  The staff was good too."}
{"text":"Really unique noodle house.  The steam buns are great and Ramen is excellent.  I make a point of going to Noodle Cat every couple of months because there's nothing else like it in town.  Casual place, atmosphere leaves a little bit to be desired but the food is excellent"}
{"text":"Clam chowder for life! My wife is a new Englander and she only comes for the clam chowder noodles. Why they're not in the menu full time is beyond me. Maybe it's above my pay grade...  also the pork miso and college ramen are good. I recommend Nama ramen noodles for everything.  #CHOWDAISLYFE"}
{"text":"They have some great vegetarian options for a noodle lover that prefers you hold the meat. I personally really like the tofu coconut curry....delicious. the portion sizes is enough for you to have leftovers too. Don't forget to grab yours a tea to go."}
{"text":"I got the pork miso ramen and it was bland and the pork was undercooked. I'm well aware that pork can be pink... but translucent and slimy? Yuck. Incredibly disappointing. Minimal and cramped seating. Overpriced meals."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've walked around downtown Cleveland and wow, has it changed.  Lots of trendy restaurants, bars, and clubs have opened up or are being planned.  I really do hope that the trend continues.  Having said that, I really wanted to LOVE Noodlecat and give it 5 stars as I hope this restaurant and all these newer places thrive and help rejuvenate the downtown area.  But my first visit to Noodlecat for an off-Friday lunch was a bit of a let-down.  The food was good, and according to Yelp, three stars = \"A-OK\" and the meal was just that.  It did not blow me away.  I had the Lunch Complete (see the photo)  which cost $17 and includes any noodle bowl, a side salad, a rice ball, some pickled veggies, grilled pepper (not shown) and a tiny chocolate/orange covered pudding-like dessert.  For my noodle, I picked the Pork Miso Ramen.  The actual ramen noodles were ok, but the broth which is so important in such noodle soups was on the salty side to me and wasn't particularly savory.  I just ate the noodles and wasn't tempted to spoon up and slurp the broth.  For the price, a bit more shredded pork would have been appreciated.  None of the accompaniments really stood out other than the miniature dessert which was very tasty.  I'm willing to go again at some point just to try a few other menu items or possibly as part of an evening downtown enjoying other area attractions.  But if I'm in the mood for a great noodle soup, I would probably choose an authentic Chinese or Vietnamese place which also avoids having to deal with downtown parking.  Best of luck to the Chef and Noodlecat -- I'll update this review if I go again and if my opinion changes after meal #2."}
{"text":"I got the hangover bowl and it was delicious. I will definitely go again....but not if I was starving. You do not get the amount of food you should for the price. You will finish the food and still be hungry. It is very good food do not get me wrong, but for the price you should get more"}
{"text":"Like everyone else giving this Noodlecat location low reviews, I'm disappointed that I have to do so. I visited Noodlecat when it was downtown on occasion, and back then it was a great, chill, sit-down ramen joint.  Those days are long gone.   Since then, whoever runs this place decided that they liked the aesthetic of a Chipotle (minus all the good parts) and the pseudo-techno amenities of a remodeled Wendy's. And that was as far as their ideas went...  They ditched the low-key sit-down style of the former downtown location for a Chipotle/cafeteria style line full of vats of miso broth and octopus tentacles. But why? It's not like you can even customize your food as it goes down the line. You just pick something off the vague, exceptionally overpriced, woefully minimal menu and wait for it pop down to the other side of the counter.  And at the end of the counter, you'll encounter the other half-baked addition to this downgrade of a ramen restaurant.   After visiting Chipotle and deciding that open air bowls of seafood and vegetables was the way to go to store and serve food, the masterminds of Noodlecat visited Wendy's and had their mind blown by those new Coke dispensers they all have now. You know, the ones that can dispense every kind of soft drink imaginable?  Well... those were kind of expensive, so they settled for the off brand model and used the savings to buy a confusingly unnecessary \"selfie\" machine to put next to the bathrooms (perhaps to use while you wait for your food?).  The only redeeming factors of this place are the great location, and the fact that the food is still pretty tasty.  Unlike some others who hope that management will read these reviews and change, I have no such hopes. Noodlecat had this location built for them. This was their vision. They thought this was the way to go. This Noodlecat can't stop being a lack-luster, poorly-executed rip-off of mediocre, Americanized, semi-ethnic, chain-eateries any more than water can stop being wet.  I'm not a huge ramen buff, and I hate to have to say all these things, but I'm truly saddened by how far Noodlecat has fallen.  I won't be coming back, and you should spare yourself the trip."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for better.   This is Japanese Ramen boiled down for the mid-west I suppose.  I don't mind the experiment with not-so traditional japanese ingredients, but the overall delivery is mediocre at best.  Tried the Takahachi Ramen and what came out was a thin broth with undercooked ramen floating it in, and some minced pork on top.  Thats...it.  Oh...and an egg floating haplessly.  The broth was, as I said, thin, and tasteless.  Ramen should have a thicker, juicier broth, slightly oily almost, with flavor.  Noodle cat's was like good broth watered down with hot water, and then served lukewarm.  The noodles were chewy but not in a good way, and the egg...overcooked.  Won't be back. Even for the happy hour."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for business. I normally love noodles but found Noodlecat lacking. I ordered iced tea and the fried chicken noodles. I never got the tea, despite asking for it again when the noodles came. The bowl of noodles was pretty much only that: noodles. There were three delicious small pieces of fried chicken, a strip or two of greens, and what amounted to a packet of ramen. Not very substantial and the broth wasn't so good that I wanted to slurp it up after to get my money's worth. I don't give 1 stars for anything but the worst food and service but this meal could use a lot of upgrade. Especially given the price, would some veggies or a more substantial amount of meat be too much to ask?"}
{"text":"If you haven't visited Noodlecat lately, I have some instructions for you.   1) Go now. Happy hour prices all day on Sunday? Methinks yes. 2) Order the szechuan ramen.  3) Taste (maybe even add some soy sauce) 4) You're welcome.   Seriously, its so good. And hell, add some protein to it with some pulled chicken or pork. It will only make it that.much.better. It's perfectly spicy, served up with veggies, noodles and even a little hint of what tasted like curry. It's deliciousness in a bowl."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the several meals I've had at Noodlecat since it opened in Westlake! The dandan noodles with a poached egg added are my favorite- spicy, salty, and delicious! My husband often orders steam buns, and they've been super tasty. I also love the pork miso noodles. I can't fathom why there are so negative reviews about Noodlecat- the food is great!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice hipster ambience. My server was very nice and knowledgeable. I had the pork Miso with traditional Ramen, which was so good! Didn't care for the sweet sake, I had better for reasonable price but besides that I'd go back!"}
{"text":"We will be returning. We went before a Monster's game and got some regular items as well as Happy Hour ones. We sat at the bar - per the usual b/c we don't like tables. The Kim Chee salad was delish - nice and fresh, crisp. We also got two of the Happy Hour Ramen Noodles and my god, that was good and HUGE - so definitely a deal. Don't go for the Happy Hour drinks unless you like Black Label because they aren't that great, but we went for the food anyway and were very happy. Cool atmosphere except the gong. I wanted to murder a few people b/c they thought it was a blast to hit all the time. Not funny."}
{"text":"I hate to give poor reviews but my one experience here was every bit of 1 star. We went on a Sunday at lunch time and it wasn't very busy, but the food still look a very long time to come out, I would say they were understaffed based on poorly stocked napkins/sauces/etc. Food was not good (perhaps I should have ordered something else), and I felt like it was significantly overpriced. I wanted to like this place, but I definitely did not."}
{"text":"I used to Yelp here, lots of pretty Yelpers have.  A lot of us did order \"appetizers\" on the side for $3 or $4 as well off this slightly HIGHER COST meeting place.  I continue to.  You can see my updated review here:  [10-13-11 Update: 2 days after I visited, Noodlecat changed its menu yet again.  The review below was current through Oct. 8, 2011.]  A lot has changed since I first reviewed Noodlecat within the first couple weeks of its opening.  Even during the prime weekday lunch hour, the dining room is noticeably less crowded and that \"palpable buzz\" I felt before is gone.  The menu has been reworked--not the most promising sign a scant three months after opening.  For lunch, a lot of the higher cost noodle soups have been taken off the menu in favor of ones at the $9 or $10 price point.  The whole list of soup add-ons (fried egg, kim chee, etc.) has also been removed, though I suspect many of them are still available on request.  I also couldn't help but notice that the Octopus & Bone Marrow Takoyaki was renamed the \"Octopus & Bone Marrow Pancake.\"  Fortunately, I think the good (but admittedly not great) qualify of the remaining noodle soups remains the same.  The Pork Miso Ramen and the Kyoto Udon are pretty solid choices and my usual go-to selections, though, again, I can't say that either is substantially better than some of the soups at Saigon around the corner.  I'm not a fan of some of the soups that contain breaded items (like breaded chicken or a vegetable tempura cake) in them--like the Dragon Soup special I had recently.  It had a nice and spicy broth, but the chicken just ended up being soggy and not particularly appetizing to look at.  I need to try the much-criticized College Ramen some time.  As for some of the \"extras\" on the menu, I continue to like the Octopus & Bone Marrow...Pancake, and the Broiled Rice Balls are still a simple, yet enjoyable, appetizer.  The same can't be said for the Twice Cooked Crispy Chicken Wings which were covered in a decent sauce that had a little bit of spicy Asian kick to it.  The wing itself, however, wasn't much more than skin and bone with a minimum amount of meat.  Particularly disappointing were the happy hour steamed buns, which were actually thick pancakes folded with meat or other filling inside of them rather than an actual bun.  When I went quite a while ago with some folks from the office, none of the buns were particularly tasty except for the BBQ Pork Bun, which was passable.  If my memory serves me right, that seems to be the only bun that survived in the latest iteration of the menu.  I still like Noodlecat, and I still visit it for lunch, but tellingly I've found myself going to Saigon more and more.  Noodlecat still has three stars in my book, but its getting close dropping down to two."}
{"text":"Oh, I'm so sad to give a poor review. I'd been to the former Noodlecat location (downtown) and always had great experiences. I have been wanting to try the new location for a while & today I stopped by the revamped Noodlecat in Crocker Park. Unfortunately I left disappointed. The restaurant has morphed info a \"fast causal\" joint where you order at the counter and then they prepare your food in a visible assembly line. They call your \"number\" and you take your food to the table of your choice--Panera Bread or Chipotle style. This leaves me with this question... why? What wasn't working about the former restaurant? Would that not have jived with this new location?  I tried something new-to-me (I'm not sure if it's a new menu item), the cauliflower curry udon. In reading other reviews I see that others have found the food too salty, however, I found this dish far too bland. The curry flavors were one-note and not even sriracha could redeem it. I had anticipated rich and complex Indian spices but while the flavor was present was very muted. The foods presentation was lovely, but once I dug my chop sticks in I found the noodles to be thick, doughy, bland and worst of all...greasy. The noods tasted like straight greasy dough and they were surrounded by the lackluster curry. The one redeeming factor was that the curry was full of vegetables--peas, diced carrot, cauliflower and (I think?) potatoes. While I have no objection with the serving sizes I found that I couldn't finish the dish because the greasy noodles were upsetting my tummy.  Overall the ambience of the restaurant is good. It was a warm spring day and the whole restaurant was open air. It was nice sitting on the patio. But this location certainly lacks the unique pop culture vibes of the former location and instead is pretty modern/plain, as if this were literally a chain restaurant [already]. As if that's the intention for Noodlecat down the line."}
{"text":"Not great... Not good either... Too bad, service was excellent and decor hip but wow, the meal fell absolutely short of expectation...I ordered the shredded pork ramin and was told it was the chefs favorite but what came out was broth, noodles, some very stringy pork and like four pieces of onion...Holy crap dudes throw some freaken vegetables in this thing! I threw in some chili pepper  to give it some life  but still I was underwhelmed...Have had WAY better..."}
{"text":"Upgrade due to the amazing Happy Hour  - this is a joy to have in the neighborhood.  I love the new menu, and how cheap the HH specials are.  2 delicious steam buns and a mini bowl for under $10?  Not bad.   HH is from 3-7, and then again from 9-11.  Cheap drink specials as well, including $1 black labels.  No, I did not have four last night :)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, it was somewhat busy, but seating was no problem.  Ordered the noodle special of the day which had scallops in it.  Took a while, but I was not in a rush.    Overall, I was not impressed.  Nice idea, but the taste was bland, and not filling.  Went in with an open mind, but wasn't blown away.  I like noodles, I like Japanese food, but Noodlecat is not for me."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour so the prices were nice and the food was good, but nothing special.   We got the steamed buns and noodle bowls.   The inside was decorated nicely and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I saw this driving by so I decided to stop because the cuteness of the name. The menu is extremely limited there's very few vegan options or options in general. I decided to try the beef and rice bowl. It took about 30 to 45 minutes for me to receive my lunch. I did come during a busy hour which was during lunch rush at 1 PM but to for a rice bowl I do not think that it should take 45 minutes. Upon her getting my food after the way it was 0K for $10 I would say the price is fair. Not the best nor not the worst it was no right experience."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place.  The spicy octopus is definitely the way to go.  The beverage selection is very limited.  The price is fine for what you get. Sometimes the service is good, other times they are understaffed and it is horrendous. (Like this past Wednesday)"}
{"text":"I don't live in Cleveland so everyone told me to \"Go to Noodle Cat!\"  It was super fun to go, since a lot of my friends had been there, but I wouldn't say it was everything I had hoped for.    AMBIANCE:  Very chill and somewhat, I guess you could say, industrial.  You sit on stools, so prep your back.  And the walls are decorated with comics.  :-)   FOOD:  The brussel sprouts were absolutely amazing as was the tempura egg.  YUM!  I ordered the Tempura noodle dish, as did my friend (she got the happy hour size).  I would definitely suggest getting that size as the regular size is BEYOND large.  We both thought our dishes were SUPER salty which is what turned me off.  I would like to go back to try another dish.  **LOVED that they had Vegan and Gluten Free options**  SERVICE:  Great.  Server was super knowledgable and helpful."}
{"text":"I've never had ramen at a restaurant so keep that in mind as you read. I thought the food was great. I got the udon with miso pork broth. The pork in the broth was tender and delicious. I will say the broth was overly salty for my taste. I realize miso is salty, so who knows, maybe thats normal. I also tried the fried chicken and bacon buns. Both were delicious. Relatively affordable place. $27 for 2 of us. Try it!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry I wasn't impressed at all. I ordered four dishes and all four lacked in flavor, I've been wanting to try this place ever since I heard about it. I drove a good distance just to be disappointed,  sorry will not be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome, fast casual hip spot with locally sourced food, freshly made noodle bowls and handheld buns! Yuuuuum meow like! bubble tea is the bomb!"}
{"text":"It's cute. Who doesn't love a noodle cat?? It's adorable. But this is my first time in Ohio and I didn't know what Cincinnati chili is and I didn't understand the menu. It's not really ramen. The menu is basically American food with noodles or bun/bao. I thought their chili was a chili styled broth, but I misunderstood and it was chili on top of ramen noodles. I also hate cloves and the clove taste was strong.   Service was friendly, stopped by a couple times to check on me, but was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start when it was just bad at every level? Everything tasted either bland or terrible, the only truly edible item we had among the 6 of us was the hangover which we all ended up sort of sharing.  I left a negative review on fb but then they wisely scrubbed the review section from their page (since what used to be a decent restaurant downtown was now getting largely 1 stars at the new location) so as a public service I came here.  Due to the overcrowded seating we chatted with the tables around us and everyone was equally miserable! Overpriced is one thing but this was actively bad food!  This is NOT the same restaurant it was downtown (a good, slightly overpriced noodle place), it's the same name but a shell of an already not mindblowing experience."}
{"text":"After reading a review of Noodlecat in Cleve magazine, we decided to give it a try. We really wanted to like this place but there were just too many missteps that we won't be going back.  We went for lunch and ordered (friendly service) 2 apps and 3 noodle dishes. We ordered wings which were fried hard, and I mean break your teeth hard. We got the bean paste potstickers and these were good (but the dipping sauce was not, I think it was just sesame oil.) We wanted the age dashi tofu but it was discontinued. The kim chee salad is not really as described on the menu and was passable.  So, I got the spicy stir fried udon w/ baby octopus. It was very oily and spicy but not really any flavor. The noodles were mushy on the outside and a little more than al dente on the inside. Pork miso ramen was too salty to eat. College ramen was good.   The other issues were that the music was too loud to hold a conversation (I know that they are looking for a certain vibe here, but you need to be able to have a conversation). And absolutely no parking, which is more of a downtown issue, but if your'e driving here youv'e been warned.   Also my son said that the seats (which are stools) and tables remind him of his school cafeteria.  So if you are looking for a cozy, warm ,inviting, asian-esque eatery this is not it. Food is marginal and not worth a second trip. Service and staff are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I recently went to Noodlecat for my lunch break and was very happy with my visit. Since I'm a planner, I always look at menus hours, and even days sometimes, before I go to the restaurant. As I looked at the menu for Noodlecat, I initially thought, \"What am I going to eat here? There's an ingredient in each one that I don't like...\"  I'm a little picky when it comes to foods, but I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried a few things... I had the Japanese Chopped Salad (w/ smoked tofu, iceberg, choy, soy braised egg, bacon, avocado & crispy ramen)  -- I asked for no tofu :)   The salad was delicious! I would highly recommend that one.  I also had two \"steam buns\" which are litle slider-type sandwiches in this sweet, sticky bread. I had the Pulled Pork one and the Japanese Fried Chicken one. SO GOOD. I couldn't complain about any of this.... loved it all. I will definitely go back.   And the prices were good too-- salad was $5 (I got the half size which was plenty), and the steam buns were $3 each!  I love the atmosphere-- it's very casual with cat cartoons all over the place. The tables and chairs aren't fancy but it makes the place feel very comfortable and chill.  I've heard they do a great happy hour so I'm excited to check that out sometime too!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for good things....First of all, unless you live within walking distance, it is next to impossible to find parking anywhere near this place.  I was simply wanting carry out to enjoy after work.  After making multiple loops around Euclid Ave I finally swooped in an opened spot on the street.       Upon entering, the decor was fun and hip.  There was no hostess at the front so I confusingly made my way back to the bar.  I noticed that they had a very diverse and excellent beer selection.  I then ordered 2 Steam Buns and the Spicy Octopus Noodle bowl.  Coming in at around $11.50 the price was not bad.  The next part is partially my fault....       I get home, open the take out bag and realize that they forgot the Broth for my noodles.  Are you kidding me?  This is like forgetting the meat on your hamburger. I should have checked the bag before I left.  I ate the Spicy Octopus noodles dry which actually had good flavor and a nice kick.  However, due to the horrible parking and bad experience I probably will not be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"So we snuck in here on a really cold blustery day. Our food overall was good,  we had two steamed buns and brussel sprouts and half noodle lunch portion each. Delicious! It was a Tuesday however,  and they were out of iced tea,  some hot tea and the fried chicken noodle bowl.. From a busy weekend they said but it was Tuesday by this point. Only two servers/hostess for whole place too... But good food."}
{"text":"I just love the tempura veggies and that sauce, The portions at times can be half or full but go for half the full is huge! so worth a cold day in drop in- Really !! The marble sodas are there the watermelon is the best. The veggies range in season and also the bbq pork ramen is the best!"}
{"text":"Our first time experience here was a hot mess. We ordered carryout. We read the reviews of Noodlecat and decided to check it out. We ordered the house ramen with coconut curry broth, substituting beef short ribs for the tofu and, the 4 pack steamed buns - 1 chicken, 2 tempura lake fish and 1 fresh bacon bun. When we walked in to pick up, could not find the bartender for 10 minutes and finally had to ask a server. There were 3 seated tables and 1 couple at the bar. Our order was waiting at the bar, however no bartender to be found. Got home, the ramen was one big glob of mush - gross to look at and the noodles were disintegrated into 1 cold mess. They should separate the noodles from the broth for carry out. Onto the steamed buns...You can order 4 for $11. I agree with another Yelp reviewer on the J-Fried Chicken bun - it is the size of a chicken nugget. As for the 2 Tempura Lake Fish buns, so sad, they were thin strips of fried nothingness, like end pieces. They were all breading, no fish. The bacon bun was a 2 inch dried out piece of pork. I suppose okay if you are into that."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ramen.at this place. Although, I thought it could be more clear that some of the ramen dishes didn't have broth. I actually have never encountered that before. The brussel sprout appetizer is really wonderful. I ordered the spicy octopus because I really like spicy ramen and this was recommended, but I subbed in chicken and added pork miso broth . It was delicious and perfectly spicy. The miso broth is creamy and delicious. The veggies were fresh. We stayed in Cleveland two days, and I went to this restaurant twice because I liked it so much. The service was not great either time I went but I had plenty of time and the food was so good, in the end it didn't matter."}
{"text":"Way over priced and not very good customer service, I feel like they get my order wrong every time. Example ordered college noodles, I paid for a 6 minute egg and got take out, didn't get my egg. So simple... very annoying."}
{"text":"Great great food ... Very creative complex flavor profiles, unique textures..the chef loves to play with ingredients.  The chopped salad is a must try, roast beef is supergood.. Prices are honest, fresh honest ingredients, charged servers...  Keep up the good work !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place to grab a quick (or so we thought) lunch on a break from a conference downtown.  There were several tables outside and in, and with no direction, we grabbed a table outside.  This apparently upset some finely tuned system by which patrons get their meals in a timely manner.  My companions went inside to try to get some menus and they were directed back to the table.  25 minutes later, we had menus.  We ended up spending over an hour and a half at this place.  The food was ok, good price for a bowl of noodles that was filling, quite expensive for $4 sodas.  If you must have asian noodles and you've got plenty of time, this place is an ok bet.  Otherwise, I say skip it."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is fairly decent, but that would be the sole thing worth writing home about on this whole menu. The pork buns used to be so much better at the E. 4th location with pickled onions. Now it is some weird Americanized version with lettuce, pickles and tomatoes. If I could order a plate of this fried chicken, it may be worth it, but for the small amount of vegetables and soggy, bland noodles I won't be back. The kimchi is also subpar at best."}
{"text":"I have celiac disease and travel a ton for work.  I found Noodle Cat on yelp and tried it out. Went for dinner and got the Shio College GF noodles with a Kim Chi salad. It was good.   I went back the next day because I saw the lunch menu was cheaper. I got the \"super\" salad and fried chicken with noodles. This meal was $10 and I could eat it every day.   The \"Super\" salad was so tasty. Kale, avocado, orange and blueberries. No bitter kale taste, the citrus went great with the crunchy kale.   Now, the fried chicken. As a celiac, these types of amazing foods are like the Holy Grail. You search for them endlessly. I miss these textures and flavors. Rarely is GF fried chicken done, or done well. Crunchy, with a touch of honey. Covered lightly with sriracha. I wanted a ten piece bucket.   Other stuff, good location. Staff was friendly. Looked like a full bar. I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"nice noodle spot in Cleveland!  Buns were good but not great (had the chicken bun) and the pork ramen. The shredded pulled pork was a bit odd, especially when you're used to a nice chunky bit of a pork slice. It was pretty tasty though.. Service was nice and attentive. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I went there to enjoy a nice dinner for take out. My partner and I arrived and were not greeted by any staff. Finally after standing around for s few minutes a young man decked out in \"Skater Boy\" clothes from Khols came up to us and told us the bartender would take our order. We went to the bar and she was nowhere to be found. We waited and waited. Then we finally ordered. The bartender was nice. She was helpful with what was popular on the menu. We both got the Dan Dan noodles with tofu. It tastes like ramen noodles with Kikoman Soy Sauce sprinkled on top. The tofu tasted and had the same consistency as a sponge from my old high schools janitor closet. And it was 13 dollars! Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could. I really liked the downtown location on Euclid. I was sorely disappointed by the Crocker Park restaurant. The food was incredibly salty, we ordered three noodle bowls all three bowls had the noodles cooked a different consistencies. The quality was poor, the restaurant was not clean. Honestly, save yourself $40 and get $1 bags of Ramen and cook it at home.  Neither myself or my kids could finish the food, all three of us felt disgusting after eating the food and I can't seem to drink enough water to get the taste of salt out of my mouth. I never leave bad reviews or reviews at all for that matter, but the food was so bad I needed to save people from wasting their money."}
{"text":"Unpretentious, delicious, feel-good food. I had the house made udon with spicy octopus (sesame chili, kohlrabi, carrot, jalapeno, cilantro) and it was great. I was served a huge portion with generous amounts of octopus and vegetables. The bacon bun was also quite tatsy. I'd eat here weekly if I lived in CLE!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Soba noodles good.  A little too salty.  Music very trendy.  Overall is was satisfying.  Maybe a little expensive for the decor which was sparse.  You sat on a stool at the table."}
{"text":"Fool me once, Noodlecat...  I deleted my original review because I thought it was unfair to review them based on a special event they were holding (as opposed to your average dining experience). So here is their fair shake, now with tempered expectations. I went in telling myself this isn't Japanese or ramen, but rather Asian fusion with the 'Asian' being heavily outweighed by whatever else it's supposed to be fused with.  Unfortunately, this second trip didn't really change my opinion. If anything, it worsened. I had the pork miso ramen. The biggest offender of this dish was the broth. It was lukewarm on arrival, and it was incredibly bland. It wasn't even salty like I've read in other reviews. It just didn't taste like anything, let alone the advertised miso. The noodles were a bit too undercooked. The pulled pork was just kind of there and felt out of place the whole time. The 6 minute egg was the only good thing about it since it was actually soft-boiled, something I don't see even some legit ramen shops doing. And that ladies and gentlemen is your pork miso ramen. A decent egg, and then everything else.  That'll be 11 bucks plus tax.  I also had a bbq pulled pork bun, which is pretty much what it sounds like. I don't know why I expected more. It was okay, but I wouldn't get it again.  Also, what's up with the lighting? It was lunch time and the lights were dimmed way down with very little natural light coming in.   I feel like I'm struggling to give it two stars, but I try to reserve 1 star reviews for the truly offensive, so... two stars, I guess. The service was good. There."}
{"text":"I used to go to the noodlecat downtown and I loved it, I was upset when they closed. So obviously I was very excited to hear of one opening in Crocker park! However, I've visited twice and was VERY disappointed. I feel it is overpriced and overall just not very good food. Hopefully they will improve in the future!"}
{"text":"So I would want to first put out the fact that I may have some biases, as my prior ramen experiences were in San Francisco and Ippudo in NYC, so it's hard to compare.  I also have a bit of a cold, so that may have altered my taste buds a bit this week.  So, just as long as all that is clear, I have to say I was not impressed with the place, but I did not think it was nearly as bad as what I would have anticipated after reading the yelp reviews, haha.    I took advantage of the restaurant week special offered for lunch, which included rice balls, a salad, a noodle bowl, and dessert.  The rice balls came with a small slice of seaweed and what I appeared to be Kewpie mayo on top.  They were ok, probably would've been better with more seaweed.  For my salad, I ordered the \"super\" salad, which was a bed of greens with azuki beans, grains, and dried blueberries on top with a soy sauce-based dressing (tasted similar to a mixture of ponzu + sesame oil).  I thought the salad was fairly tasty, although a little too heavy on the sauce, and perhaps slightly too much of a mixture of ingredients on top (the azuki beans were probably unnecessary).  Finally, the main course...  So for the noodle bowl, I ordered the Ohio Beef Brisket and Matzo Ball ramen.  It came in a large bowl with two giant matzo balls and several large, thin, well done slices of brisket.  I know people who complain about the noodles, but in comparison to other ramen places I've been, I actually thought the noodles were just fine. The broth, on the other hand, did not quite live up to standards.  Unlike what many other reviewers felt, I did not think it was too salty.  However, it just didn't stand out;  perhaps a bit to bland if anything.  The meat was good, and I have no opinion on the Matzo balls, as this was my first experience with Matzo balls at all.  Overall, I'd say the ramen was alright, although probably not something I would return for.  The dessert that came with the restaurant week menu was a small lemon cake with a lemon olive oil sauce topped with some creme fraiche.  It was a fairly tasty treat, thought just a bit on the dry side.  Probably my favorite part of the meal, though.   In terms of stuff outside of food, I'd say the restaurant looked pretty cute.  I was a fan of the cat comic book decor, and the lighting was I guess ok for setting a trendy mood.  The service was good;  I thought our waitress was both sweet and hospitable.    So overall, despite all my nitpicking, I'd say the meal was pretty fair and definitely worth the restaurant week price.  It's probably not enough to make me return on a regular basis, but I'm also not a diehard \"must have ramen\" kind of girl."}
{"text":"I seen how many wonderful reviews noodlecat had and I just had to come and see for myself, and the hype is very true! The waitresses and manager are very kind and friendly, the restaurant is very clean and the food is very light and delicious. The ramen soup I had was pretty good, but what was even better was the pulled pork sandwich! I also got the onigiri rice balls and those were great with the soy sauce. We also got a dessert it was a tasty bun with a banana and hot chocolate syrup and milk. Overall I really enjoyed it and will go there again."}
{"text":"The service here is so terrible. What makes it worse is they did't even seem to care! No apologies for the extremely long wait... no explanations given like that they were understaffed... nothing. It's like they knew they weren't doing well and probably weren't going to get a good tip and so they just said \"F it\" and gave up.  We were ignored so much. No one ever even asked if we wanted more water. I also had to poor my leftover soup in the container myself, which was so awkward. I started spilling broth on the table because the bowls are awkwardly shaped. The stools are also uncomfortable when you're left waiting and sitting forever for your check, my butt started to hurt. Never again noodle cat. Your food is just \"ok\" so not even worth it."}
{"text":"This is such comforting and delicious food. The steam buns are meltingly soft, the noodles have a nice bite to them and come in a good variety of broths, heat levels, and veggie combinations, and the salads are an incredible serving size. You will absolutely feel satiated after you've eaten."}
{"text":"Well worth the price you pay. Bowls are filling and very enjoyable. Fast food prep, and overall nice experience. The music selection is also on point"}
{"text":"If I could give this a 2.5, I would.  By no means was it a bad experience, but I also can't ever see myself going back.  Maybe if I was out with a group of people and they wanted to go?  Even then I'd probably offer up some alternatives.    There are a lot of really harsh reviews on here, and I totally get why, but honestly my experience wasn't terrible.  The servers were all friendly, I liked the music, and I liked the interior, but the food was just okay at best.  I was with a group of four, and between us we had the pickled sampler, the edamame, and the brussel sprouts as appetizers.  We had a lot of fun trying (and watching each our reactions to) the various pickled items, but I thought the sprouts were waaaaaaaaay too salty.  The edamame was tasty, but it's hard to screw that up.  For the entree I had the Tempura Soba Dori noodles.  They weren't bad, but they also weren't that great.    That seemed to be the overall experience of the night.  Not bad, but not great.  Cleveland has much, much better offerings if you're in the mood for this genre of food.  If you really get hit with a noodle craving, your $11 would be better spent at Superior Pho, Minh Anh, or Bac on some of their pho or vermicelli."}
{"text":"I love ramen noodles.  It's up there with pho for me.  I've waited hours for a good bowl of it.  There really is nothing like a bowl of homemade ramen noodles in a spicy broth with spicy miso, spinach, pork and an egg.  I crave it all the time and until Noodlecat came along there was no where for me to get anything even close to it in Cleveland.   As soon as I walked in I got excited.  The place was adorable.  I felt like I was in a traditional noodlehouse. My dining partner and I headed straight to the back and took a seat by the bar.  Our server was friendly and personable and offered suggestions when asked.  I immediately knew that I wanted the pork miso ramen as that was the closest to my favorite type.  My partner got the takahachi ramen and we split the japenese fried chicken and tonkatsu buns.   The buns were pretty awesome.  I liked how the fried chicken one was spicy and I like the pickled cucumber.  I wish there was more of that.  However, as soon I took a bite of the soup I kinda knew that I didn't find a Cleveland replacement for ramen noodles.  The noodles were good, they were my favorite part.  But I couldn't drink any of the broth it was incredibly salty.  I even tried to mix it with the noodles and it didn't work.  I had to eat the noodles plain.  The broth was like they took the broth from an instant pack and dumped more salt into it.  My companion already started to get heartburn before we got to the car.   Also, I wasn't a fan of the pork belly in the soup.  It was all mushy and you could see just how fatty it was.  Eating it crispy I can ignore the fatty parts, but when it's in soup it was just solid fat.   I don't know if I'll be back but I may order takeout to try the soba noodles or some of other tempting items on the menu, but I think I'm going to stay away from the ramen noodles or anything that's served with that broth.   However, the house tea was really nice and did balance out the salt a little bit."}
{"text":"Very interesting take on Vietnamese noodle bowls. Definitely not impressed some things had flavor some things didn't prices medium to high there is no atmosphere it's a little low budget I don't see him lasting more than 3 months"}
{"text":"Deep in the heart of flavor country a lone noodle vendor stands, Noodle cat. Offering ramen, soba, and steam buns this booth had quite the selection.   I opted for the miso ramen and the market special bun of the day which happened to be Dohar's spicy smoked sausage.   First of all the steam buns were amazing, and i'd recommend dohar's meats to everyone. The bun itself was perfectly steamed, great consistency.   The ramen was rich, the pork amazing, and the garlic perfect. I did ask how spicy and they warned me it was mild. They offered to kick it up and I asked them to take it to overdrive. Unfortunately I was driving a Porsche and they were in a civic so our ideas of overdrive differed vastly. It was still good, but not as spicy as I like. The only other drawback was the lack of soft-boiled eggs to add.  When it's all said and done, I'll go back. I'd even recommend it to everyone. Noodle Cat was delicious, you just need more kick."}
{"text":"I don't know how I've written 30 reviews and this hasn't been one of them.  I go to Noodlecat more than anywhere else in Cleveland (except maybe Dive Bar, somewhat shamefully).  The fare is unique and delicious. If you're tired of eating a broken record*, check out Noodlecat.    Steam Buns, I love you.  You little adorable sliders, each of you on a delicious warm gooey bun, I eat you like tic-tacs.  You come in so many delicious flavors.  Like you, Mr. BBQ Pulled Pork, you're zesty and bold.  Or how about you, Mrs. Fat Casual Smoked Turkey... you bear a light, spicy taste with your spicy mayo and avocado.  And then there's you,  Miss Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana dessert steam bun.  And how could I forget Dr. Tempura Veggie. You're my old faithful, with the delicious contrast of crispy fried vegetables and the soft steam bun.  And all of you come with yummy pickled onions.  I could go Kobayashi all of you!  As much as I'd love to, I don't order ALL the Steam Buns, because it is necessary to save room for some NOODLES.  Hey, they don't call it 'SteamBunCat'.   Imagine eating ramen noodles, but these noodles are on steroids.  And instead of that powdered broth, they come in high-quality stock.  And they throw in all sorts of other goodness.  My favorite is the Spicy Tofu Udon - tofu, peas, carrots, kelp and noodles, all taking a broth bath together. Roscoe's Fried Chicken and Ramen is a genius yummy concoction ... and you thought adding Fried Chicken to waffles was as good as it could get.   The prices at Noodlecat are reasonable. You're talking $11 for a full portion of noodles ($6 half), and $3 for each steam bun.  But if you think about it, that's not expensive for adventurous downtown eating.  If that's still too pricey for you, don't fret.  THEY HAVE THE BEST HAPPY HOUR IN CLEVELAND.  I tell my mom about this happy hour.  $1 black label beers.  $2 steam buns.  $5 half portions of noodles.  $3 Sapporo.  3-7 weekdays, and all day Sunday.    * This is a figure of speech.  I hope you don't literally eat broken records. That would hurt. On both ends."}
{"text":"I am a huge Noodlecat fan. I didn't give it the 5th star because service can be a little shaky at times. I usually get my slurpalicious fix during the week on my lunch break and I always go away satisfied. I started off trying a little of everything on the menu but eventually settled in on my favorite combination of tasty treats. I start off with a Fat Casual Smoked Turkey steam bun. It's fantastic. Shaved turkey, sprouts, avocado and come kind of spicy delicious sauce. Once I have chowed that down I move onto the main event. Crispy Beef Short Rib Ramen. Better known as \"nom nom nom\" OMG. I am drooling over here just thinking about it. It's as the title suggests... crispy beef short ribs served with a bowl of ramen noodles swimming in a spicy kimchee infused pork broth. It's the perfect meal. Please take some time and go by and visit Noodlecat. If Chef Sawyer is there, tell him hello he is one cool dude."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here last night before catching a movie. We were regulars at the E 4th location and while I understood that the restaurant \"concept\" had changed, it was under the impression that I would still be receiving the quality of food I was used to. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, I was shocked to see that they are no longer offering the wide variety of flavors (I especially miss the Short Rib Ramen). I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was with our meal. We ordered the brussels sprouts and broccoli to share, which were the best thing we ate. I ordered the Pork Miso Ramen with a fried chicken bun and my daughter had the Fried Chicken Ramen with a Shrimp Tempura bun. While my ramen was flavorful, the portion was surprisingly small. The actual bun of the fried chicken bun was stale (not soft at all like it was at the E 4th location) and the chicken itself was overcooked and very salty. My daughter's ramen on the other hand was not seasoned whatsoever and the chicken drumstick was dangerously undercooked.  I cannot say how her bun was because I did not taste it and she did not comment. If the quality of food does not improve I am very sad to say that this trip will be our first and last to this latest location."}
{"text":"Checked out this place causer we saw a cat as the logo. The place was small and clean. Ordered the hangover noodle and gf ordered the hotdog bun. My ramen was hot and good. Only complaint was the saltiness of the bacon and the ice water that tastes funky."}
{"text":"One of my Cleveland favorites!  Noodlecat has nailed \"Clevanese\" down to an art form. They take Japanese-inspired flavors and execute them with a strong commitment to locally-raised and locally-produced foods.  Their house infused draft Sake is delicious. The spicy octopus udon stir-fry is great. As for portions, I have never needed a whole order of noodles there. I typically stick to a half order of noodles, a couple of steam buns, and some sake. High quality food for a pretty great price--especially during happy hour.  I have never been disappointed at Noodlecat"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. The ship college ramen was lacking flavor and it had a bunch of chicken bones. Everyone else in our party said the soups were super bland. The bartender was too busy on his phone in the server station to actually get our orders and drinks. He told us they were out of happy hour sake and then poured more expensive stuff but failed to not the price increase. And our checks were all messed up. It seemed like a lot of employees were just standing around and/or on phones so there wasn't much opportunity to get help elsewhere. In the end, we get a \"sorry for all the mistakes\" after giving them the chance to make it right."}
{"text":"I love love love their udon noodles! Broth is very flavorful! Pork miso is delish  new buns on the menu are really good too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! I've been to the location downtown and it was excellent so i figured this location would be as well, but instead was left extremely disappointed and nauseated. Given the location and price you would expect more. I ordered the college ramen($7.99) with fried shrimp($4). They gave me 4 quarter size pieces of shrimp and the ramen was unseasoned and bland, all i tasted was peas. The only reason i didn't throw it away was because of how much i spent on it. The other person i was with ordered the cauliflower curry. It was a watery mess in a bowl that they must have just thrown some spices in and over cooked noodles and called it \"curry\".  Overall, 99 cent ramen would have better than this, never going back again."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to go to Noodlecat my husband and I finally got a day off of work together and someone to watch our two kids. Whole day planned, first stop is Noodlecat and then on to West Side Market. I even know what I am going to order (pork ramen) and can guess what my husband is going to order (short rib ramen). On Wednesday, December 28, 2016 we drive the 45 minutes from our house to downtown Cleveland, pay to park, go to Noodlecat. Doesn't appear to be open at first glance but we try the door and it is open. Find out it doesn't look open because hardly any lights are on, no other customers, and all the employees are standing in the back chatting. We are told to sit anywhere so we do. Server takes our order for hot tea and walks away. He comes back with the tea and tells us \"So we are missing some menu items today. We do not have the pork for the pork ramen or the short ribs for the short rib ramen. You can order the broths but that is it.\" He then walks away. We drink our tea. It is lukewarm, at best, and tastes stale. We wait about 15 minutes for server to come back so we can pay for our tea and leave since they don't have anything we were going to order. My husband finds all the employees standing in the back of the place, again. He asks if we can pay. Server asks if we want food and my husband tells him no because they don't have either of the items we wanted to order. Server says \"Ok\", takes the payment, and walks away. We leave the store. End of story. So my months long ramen craving will not be fulfilled and I do not plan on returning anytime soon for what was an all around poor dining experience: lackluster service, no food to order, lukewarm and stale \"hot\" tea, and a perception of a lack of caring from the establishment. Too bad, I expected more from a Jonathan Sawyer restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my bowl of noodles. It was tasty and favor full. I would suggest ordering a side of pork belly which added to the dish.   I also had a pulled pork steam bun and it was delicious. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great place for noodle lovers. I had a nice lunch here while visiting Cleveland. My Hangover dish was perfect and yes I was hungover. It had lots of crunchy items to go with the savory bacon etc. I also had the fried chicken steam bun which was excellent. The sauce was a combo of sweet maple and spicy buffalo sauce. My DC's noodle bowl was also a hit. Can't wait to return to noodlecat."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this Noodlecat I was really hoping for something great.  Man, I feel like a Debby Downer...I just felt that the magic and passion was not there.  My girlfriend ordered Tempura Soba Dori.  It was new to both of us.  The tempura was expert.  Green tasted pretty good but the sauce was pretty salty.  I ordered the Kimchi salad which was light and felt right.  Now a very strong kimchi, but a very good esque flavor of the real deal.  I ordered Spicy Tofu Udon for my main plate.  It was just ok.  Noodles were al dente which I was surprised to find with asian style.  Again the broth was salty.  Food was ok, nothing really blew me away.  Service was good, but seemed like it took a lot of energy to serve us.  Another big kicker was the price.  It seemed a little high, not outrageous, but too much for the quality of what was served.  Chairs leave comfort to be desired! I feel bad writing this.  I really want to like local establishments.  I applaud creativity and well delivered concepts. Truly I want to give Noodlecat 3+ but its just missing something.  I would come back because I like the idea."}
{"text":"I've been to Noodlecat probably a bajillion times, but a few recent mediocre experiences have me a bit disappointed. My favorite time to visit is happy hour, when 1/2 portions of noodle bowls are $5 and steam buns are 2 for $5. The steam buns are AWESOME, my favorites are the CAB burger and pulled pork. Lately I've noticed some inconsistencies in preparation for my favorite noodle bowls. I'd come to expect a certain standard and haven't gotten that on my last two visits. I was super excited for the Hokkaido ramen to come back, and got it for lunch to-go one day and it was amazing. I decided to come back for the happy hour special on my birthday and got the Hokkaido ramen again since I had enjoyed it so much. I was incredibly underwhelmed this time. It didn't taste the same at all, and was offensively bland. Another visit (this time it was dinner, after happy hour), we got the brisket bowl and it was just as bad. The meat was tough (not the standard for brisket)?!   These sub-par experiences have kept me away from one of my favorite lunch spots for the past month or so. Hopefully they can get this place back into shape..."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been visiting Noodlecat since years ago at the old location. We still miss some of the original items from the old menu such as the clams and pork belly udon, and especially the spicy short rib ramen. That being said, the Crocker park location is still worth the occasional 1 1/2 hour drive. The beef brisket ramen and hangover ramen are solid dishes. I've always considered the steam buns a bit overpriced so we rarely get them. The Brussel sprouts/ broccoli appetizer is out of this world good, we love it. My wife lived in Japan for 7 years and is picky about ramen and this is her favorite spot by far in both Cleveland and Pittsburgh. We are always surprised at the poor ratings in Yelp. Just try it out!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I tried out Noodlecat this week and we both were happy we did.  We both ordered the Tsukemen Ramen and we impressed with how filling a bowl of noodles could be, and how tasty.  We each got some 'add ins' which honestly weren't even necessary with as tasty as the broth, pork and noodles were on their own.    Be warned the tables are communal, which honestly didn't bother us, and you will have to ask for a fork if needed (don't judge we each got one).  Finally the prices are a bit high for lunch, but that isn't enough to keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately me and my husband were disappointed with the lack of flavor in the dishes. After waiting a very long time to place our order... and even longer to get our food....and even longer to get our check it did not live up to our expectations. Very saddening because we really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Save your money. We went to Noodlecat tonight after a previously bad experience to give it another chance and were disappointed again. The bartender, to her credit, was very apologetic. While she was nice the bar was frequently untended and so were the tables. Lots of people waiting a long time for food.   We ordered college style ramen and the broth was basically chicken flavored water. No salt, no flavor development. We had to request salt and other seasonings to try to doctor the ramen but there was really no saving it and we weren't the only ones who sent food back. We are huge fans of Greenhouse so to see this restaurant of Chef Sawyer's falling flat is really a let down. Hoping Chef Sawyer gives this place a little more attention soon because it really needs it."}
{"text":"I've been trying Noodlecat off and on for years, because it was the most convenient ramen option downtown. Last visit was a few weeks ago and I can tell you, it was mostly definitely my last attempt.   They've gone downhill and it's too obvious. My noodles weren't fresh, they were most definitely the last of a pot that had been sitting there, there were huge clumps of hard stuck together noodles in my bowl, so many that it was difficult to even slurp!   The broth is getting weaker and weaker (pork broth). It's on par with what you would get in a Blue Apron ramen, not an authentic ramen shop. Overall the bowl was bland and left-over tasting.   The saving grace used to be the buns, and it still is (the fried chicken one is amazing), but the portion sizes of the actual meat is definitely smaller than it used to be as well.   Sorry Noodlecat, I wanted to love you but I can't any longer."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. My husband and I have been going here pretty regularly for about three years. I am hooked on the kimchi and the soba dori bowl. I love the tea selection too!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Noodlecat for some time now. I use to frequent the Downtown location a few times a month for lunch, so I was beyond thrilled when they moved to my hometown Westlake. I live near Crocker but could not get there in time before close the first week. My anticipation only built from there!  I finally made it to Crocker and even brought my daughter who loves Ramen but has never tried Noodlecat. This is where everything falls apart.  I was hoping to call in my order and pick up 10 minutes later, only to be told they \"do not take orders over the phone.\" Ok, no big deal, I'm not in a super rush so I'll park and walk. My daughter ordered the Child's butter Ramen and I ordered my favorite- the Udon Octopus. For half the price of my bowl, she received 3 times the amount of food than I did. When I ordered this for lunch downtown, it was at least 2 meals for me. I finished this and am still hungry. I'm disappointed in the changes, I'm not going to lie. I've been bragging about Noodlecat on both FB and IG for some time now.  I emailed them to let them know, very politely, that this occurred. I assumed it was an accident as they're normally so awesome. They said they'd get back to me- then either blocked me or shut their page down. It's been 3 weeks and I've yet to receive a response. I'm a bit offended- I use to love this place and now I'll probably never go again."}
{"text":"We split college ramen and a pork ramen. Both were bland and very unappealing, to the point of being inedible after a couple bites. Our server was great but the lack of atmosphere really ruined it. We left thinking of ways to make our own, better than noodle cat ramen.  Tldr; don't waste your money!!!"}
{"text":"Lame and pretentious. Small overpriced portions of basically bland ramen. The bowl consisted of noodles and tofu, noods and pork, noods and PEAS AND CORN. Get that corn outta my face. The food tasted good ish but WAY overpriced. Even IF The noods are homemade- very boughie pricing. At least give me a proper bowl made from a washable and reuseable material, not a cardboard bowl thanks. Lighting is severe and seating limited. Buns were good tho some were so sloppy the paper stuck to the food. Also, lights were bright I felt like I was in a tanning bed. Very crowded and tiny. That's it. Take care."}
{"text":"Only reason I gave Noodlecat two stars instead of one is because when I went there a year ago, it wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  However, when I recently went back it was just a very poor experience.  I walked in on a weekend afternoon.  There was a hostess stand, but no hostess, and no signs of their being anyone.  I waited a few minutes and figured it must be seat yourself.  Went to sit at the window where there is a little bench area to look out the window.  A hipster-y looking gentleman came over to me, and asked \"What do you want?\"  It kind of took me back with the attitude being directed at me, so I said I wanted to order food and would like a menu.  A few minutes later a group of girls came in, sat down at a table immediately and a nice lady came over to them and said that she'd bring them menus right over.  I waited another 5-10 minutes and still received no menu and no hint of the first guy that asked me what I wanted.  I then left, and definitely have no plans of returning."}
{"text":"I had the ramen noodles with pork miso. It was good, but way too salty for my taste. Also had 2 of the Ohio beef burger steam buns which were tasty. Cute place, liked the pencil and paper order yourself concept."}
{"text":"I would have rated noodle a solid 4 the last time I ate here but it appears some things have changed. First off, the menu. They recently changed it and got rid of a lot of amazing options. The new menu is very lackluster. Second, the service was terrible. I was served by a woman behind the bar who said she was a manager. She never put my order of steam buns in even after verbally confirming that I wanted them while standing at the register. She also never brought the iced tea that I asked for and rarely was around to refill my water. She also got a very nasty attitude with a customer who was complaining about the menu. Even if a customer is being rude, you are the manager... I'd expect you to act more appropriate. She then bragged to other customers about how she handled the situation. The food was mediocre at best. I probably won't come back here in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I'd would give it zero stars if I had the option. Step off of east 4 and it's like I entered the twilight zone. Took at least 3 mins to get a menu, server had some kind of sauce on his face seemed out of it or at the least bit not interested. Then proceed with mind you no one in the restaurant another 4 mins before we saw our actual server who seemed like she had just puffed a fatty and had no idea what she was doing. On top of all this we order because we have heard decent things and a friend of ours works there. Now on to the food it's uninspired and honestly if the chef doesn't give a crap, the front of the house employees, or the management staff(who I never saw once) why even keep your doors open? This is an absolutely shame to whoever invested their money."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed lately, so I'm downgrading my review--the service has been inconsistent.  I order take-out frequently, and they get my order wrong 75% of the time!     As time goes by, it becomes less appealing to me."}
{"text":"Tried Noodlecat for the first time today. Our food was warm, not hot, and the service was very whatever. The taste of the food was overall great with a good blend of textures. It's just a shame that poor service and poor heating elements seem to be holding back the menu's potential."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is outstanding and the food is top-notch! I've only been here three times but every time is delicious and I always want to come back!  My most recent trip was superb. Started off with the steam buns which are so delectable! We had the veggie and the fried chicken ones, and they were so tasty!  We had some house sake and a specialty orange sake as well with dinner which was also delicious (and I'm not that much of a sake drinker).   I had the College Ramen, which is a simple ramen with chicken and vegetables and it was great! I'm so happy this place realizes that not everything has to taste like a bucket of salt. When I was growing up I thought ramen was just those disgusting sodium packets poured over pre-packaged dry noodles. Yuck!   The ramen here relies on the natural flavors, and is seasoned perfectly. My boyfriend had the Katsudon, which is a panko fried pork cutlet (my recommendation)...I love Katsudon! I tried his dish as well and it was perfect!   The only reason I gave this place 4/5 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of the atmosphere. It's very casual but also has a stale and cold feel to it. But the food is enough for me to keep coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to write this review. I try to avoid writing bad reviews because I hate how it affects restaurants. However, hopefully NoodleCat can take this review and work on changing. I must start off by saying how much I loved the Euclid location. My partner and I stopped in for the first time last year and absolutely fell in love! Delicious, HUGE portions of ramen and wonderful buns! The chicken buns were on par with buns I've had in NYC. Sooo good. We went many, many times after despite living an hour away.   Today, my mom and I came in excited to have ramen and shop. I got a bad feeling when I walked into the shop because it mimicked the look of a Panda Express (not to say PE is bad, just that I wasn't expecting counter service). I was surprised to see that the buns were a similar price yet only came in orders of one, but whatever. I ordered one chicken bun for each of us. We both got hangover ramen. Upon receiving our food I was pretty surprised on the size. Very, very small bowl. I thought I accidentally ordered a child size compared to what they used to be. Normally it would take me three meals to finish. This time I ate the whole thing right there.  The pulled pork inside was very good, as well as the egg. It was perfectly soft-boiled. I don't think the bacon or kimchi had any reason being there, but that's okay. The potato sticks were okay, but way too many on top, they were spilling over my bowl. The amount of broth (the best part!) was ridiculous. Maybe about 4 tablespoons? The ratio of food to broth was wayyyyy off. The noodles were subpar. Just your typical packet ramen noodles, which I saw behind the counter were dried and boiled upon ordering.  The buns were horrendous. Instead of moist, crispy fried chicken, it was dry and awful. The size was so small. The bun was stale. There was no spicy mayo. So so so sad. I've included a before picture and a picture of my chicken I had in my bun today.   Very sad. My mom and I still had a good time, I'm just disappointed how the quality dropped so much. I hope they are able to fix the problems they have and get back to their original greatness. I am definitely rooting for you, NoodleCat."}
{"text":"Friendly place and casual with good food. Cheap black label beer and enjoyed the apps. Don't forget to add the extras in your noodle dish to make it even better."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Noodlecat this past Saturday night. And to my surprise, it was rather dead despite the beautiful weather, thousands of people just letting out of the Indians game and the nearby East 4th crowd just around the corner. We were one of maybe three other groups in the entire space on this Saturday night.   The Japan Anime theme was neat. I liked the pink and periwinkle blue color scheme and the comic-strip on the wall, but the non-stop upbeat Japanese pop music was insufferable after a while. After absorbing it all over an entire meal, the ambiance almost seems too themey to the point where it kind of feels like a parody of itself.  To start, we shared a BBQ Pork steam bun for $4. A pillow-like bun folded over to sandwich BBQ Pork in between. This was our first sign that Noodlecat would be a non-traditional take on this type of cuisine. Typically, steamed buns are whole buns with a filling inside. Noodlecat's rendition looked more like a stuffed pita. Besides that, it was in fact good.  After debating on what would be next, I found the noodle bowls to be a tad expensive for what they were. Noodles are inexpensive to make and probably shouldn't be $13-$15 per bowl. I mean, a large bowl of Pho at Superior Pho is only $7.75. I'm fairly certain Noodlecat is missing on the price point here. And it's not like you're paying for ambiance at a fine dining establishment either. I mean, you sit on stools in a very casual atmosphere while slurping noodles. In other parts of the world, this is poor people street food.  After much debate, I settled on the Fried Chicken Ramen. A humongous bowl of ramen and broth with a side of two fried chicken thighs. Certainly enough to fill even the most hungry. I couldn't finish mine and besides, wanted to save room for dessert.   We'd soon be informed that dessert, as listed on the menu as \"daily preparation at market price\" wasn't offered as of yet. Or perhaps they already 86'd it from the menu because customers rarely ordered dessert because they were too full? Either way, we opted to get the Chocolate and Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun instead. That sounded close enough to dessert. And it was damn good! It even came with a shot of milk to wash it down, which I thought was cute.  Next time, knowing the entrée sized noodle bowls are so huge, I'll know not to order an appetizer. I really wish Noodlecat would offer half portion bowls; that way, customers would be more apt to sample more of the menu.   I'm looking forward to see where Noodlecat goes from here. I'm pretty sure the critics have spoken. Where they go from here is their choice. A place like this shouldn't be dead on a weekend night. They do have a good thing going with a unique take on a cuisine that is in great need here in Cleveland. It just needs a few tweaks. They need to advertise strictly as a non-traditional take on ramen. Experienced noodle eaters seem to get all bent out of shape when they find out the menu here is quite different from the traditional joints they've eaten at elsewhere. Secondly, they need to work on the price-point. We had 2 bowls of ramen, 2 steam buns, 1 soft drink and 1 black tea and the bill was nearly $50. This is a very casual eatery and a very casual type of food. Even if they offered half portion bowls, I think customers would have a better perception of value. Other than that, everything was good. Nothing mind blowing, but I'm excited to see where they go from here! The ceiling for potential is limitless with a few key alterations that is."}
{"text":"Heard it is horrible and overpriced. Scared to try it. Great location but I was expecting the nice noodle places all over Chicago."}
{"text":"Delicious! A pleasant surprise. Had the crispy Brussels sprouts appetizers & braised short rib ramen along with a Sapporo for dinner. Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to noodlecat twice. The first time I went, really enjoyed it...they had a great happy hour and I ordered their spicy octopus which was very good. However, I ordered the crispy beef short rib ramen today and was a little disappointed  The broth was way too salty with no flavorful depth. I appreciated their take on kimchi in the broth but all it did was  add more salt and no flavor. Maybe they should add fish sauce or fermented shrimp for that je nais se qua flavor apparent in traditional kimchi. What really broke my heart were the short ribs. I loved how they had it cut thin with the bones, but they cooked it to the point where it was dry and tough, kalbi (Korean style shortribs) should be tender and soft with a nice caramelization from the sugar. Maybe I caught them on an off day? I ordered carry out this time.   Regardless I am in no hurry for a repeat visit or carry out order"}
{"text":"Pretty affordable for a trendy place. I always just get like 5 steam buns. Today was with whole family so I snagged some of my daughters noddles and they were great too. Uncomfortable seating and can be slow service. Great for when you have the kids but don't want to get kid friendly crap. It's very good for adults and even picky kids will eat ramen."}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. Don't waste your time and money. Worst meal I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"WHYYYYYYYYYY! Menu changed, AGAIN. Returned to noodlecat after my previous declining experiences because I saw online the clam chowder was back on the menu. Visited with a friend who was equally excited about this (and our husbands).Our server was gushing over the new menu saying how, \"many old favorites were back\". I thought this was the day I had been waiting for! Their original calm chowder was one of my favorite dishes in the city! NOTE: the clam chowder that has returned to the menu is a shadow of it's former self. And read the menu CLOSELY: potato, corn, bacon, chives, clam chowder dashi $11. That's right. \"clam chowder dashi\". Do you see actual clams on that list? No. We didn't see them in our \"clam chowder\" either. NO CLAMS WTF. That's like ordering a \"Chicken Noodle Soup\": carrots, celery, parsley, noodles, chicken flavored broth. WITH NO CHICKEN. Also of note, the \"potato\" is not a plethora of potato chunks (as one might expect to find in a chowder) it was a small handful of potato chip sticks on top of the udon. You know, potato stix? It was like those on top.   Good grief noodlecat, how do you put \"clam chowder\" on the menu and it now contains NO CLAMS. Clam chowder with no clams, but potato chips. Still can't get over this. My friend and I actually thought we were given the incorrect bowls. We thought we were incorrectly given the new Hangover bowl. We actually asked for the menu back. That's when we noticed the calm chowder just has \"clam chowder dashi\".   Aside from the clam chowder disaster, they were also out of the fried chicken the night we visited. Which means no fried chicken steam buns and no fried chicken ramen. At our table we ordered 6 steam buns between the four of us. This was the first visit we were disappointed by our buns. The quality seemed to have decreased dramatically even from the last time we visited, and they were not brought to our table until after our noodles. In all our experiences here, our buns always came to our table within 5 minutes. The bowls followed after our buns. During this visit, it was reversed.   I really want to knock this down to one star, but I can't based on my memories of when noodlecat opened. I also save one star reviews for places I actively get food poisoning. Noodlecat was so great when it first opened, but it is now a shadow of itself. Team Sawyer, if you're promising to bring an \"old favorite\" back to your menu, can you please not make it COMPLETELY different than it existed in the original state? And can the clam chowder at least have clams again? Is that too much to ask?   Until we meet again..."}
{"text":"Dropped in here before a baseball game after meaning to visit for so long and was glad I did! Many of my friends don't like Noodlecat, but I think that's because they wanted authentic food.   As everyone else said, if you want authentic, go elsewhere.   Service was fast (although they did forget my beer) despite the restaurant being quite full. My friend and I split the green curry sausage dumpling and the fried chicken dumpling appetizers. Fried chicken was fun, but green curry was definitely tastier. I just wish they had had more filling--there was too much dough. Luckily, they strange fold over shape makes it easy to tear off the extra dough and dip it in your entrée or douse in sriracha!   I had the hokkaido ramen as an entrée and it was delicious. The corn broth was creamy, but not overwhelmingly so and the cream didn't taste fatty, which would have ruined the noodles and the pork. Tasty and filling. I got the half and was stuffed but wanted a whole because I just wanted to keep eating it!   I'll definitely be back before other Indians games (crosses fingers) and before Monsters games this winter! Next time, I'm going to see if I can get the short rib ramen. It sounds awesome, but is only offered on their take-out menu. I'm hoping they'll still let me order it sit-down!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! I visited for lunch today and ordered the fried chicken ramen (added egg). Wow. It was everything I had hoped for and more! The egg wasn't fried as I had expected, it was medium/hard boiled, but it totally worked. The bone-in chicken was perfectly fried and the flavor overall was on point. I ate the whole thing and was fully satisfied.  The seating area was on little smaller side, but our group of 10 was able to pull a few tables together without a problem at 11:45. Thanks for coming to Crocker Jonathan Sawyer!!! I could seriously eat here daily...and just might given my office location   Update- After visiting here on several occasions, I've always had a solid experience. The portions have fluctuated, but it seems they are larger now. Also, this is a different concept than the old Noodlecat. There are no servers, but it's still delicious. Hopefully everyone gives it another try. 2 stars for this great spot the area needed makes me sad."}
{"text":"I think their noodles and buns are all very good!  The buns are delicate, soft and small so you can probably finish it in 2 bites(also to avoid the insides from falling out). If you want to try other things on their menu along with your noodle then I recommend ordering a half noodle bowl so you'll have enough room in your tummy unless you have A LOT of room in your tummy then get the full size."}
{"text":"I will never understand how people could have a beef with this place.  I've always had the friendliest service, dishing up some incredibly tasty food at unbelievable prices. Chef Sawyer knows what the hell he's doing -- the only thing I didn't enjoy was the College Ramen, which sadly lived up to its name a little too well.  Oh, and this place has one of the most generous happy hours I've ever seen.   When I was an undergrad at CSU, this was among my most frequented lunch spots, and I crave it all the time now here in Portland. Yeah, in Portland, the Holy Land of cheap and delicious food, I still crave Noodlecat.  Get all the steam buns, whatever the special of the day is, the Roscoe's ramen, the Spicy Octopus Udon, the Kim Chi Salad... add the 6 minute egg to almost everything... I'm sure Chef Sawyer has added a few new surprises to the menu since I left CLE almost a year ago, but step out of your comfort zone and order whatever your server/bartender says is most delicious/exciting that week. It's pretty simple :)"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place, I was disappointed when I got there.  I've been told the menu has been reduced. I'm fine with a limited menu, but if that's the case, everything had better be amazing.  I had the squid with soba noodles. It was good, a little on the salty side but not unbearable.  I ordered one of each bun and was not impressed, maybe it's because I find flavorless bread type bun to be a waste of time, but again the fillings didn't steal the show."}
{"text":"Jonathan Sawyer should just stick to Greenhouse Tavern. We really had high hopes for Noodlecat. I placed an order for pick up, when I arrived the hostess (if that's what she was) just stared at me. I told her I had an order to be picked up and my name. All I got from her was a sour attitude as she snapped \"uhhh you need to go to the bar.\" The place was so dark I didn't first see the bar when I walked in being that it was all the way in the back. The girl at the bar was very pleasant. When I got home and we started to open the food we were surprised. We thought the buns would be a bit bigger (looks like it in the picture on yelp).. I got the BBQ pork. I was under the impression from previous encounters with pork belly that it was suppose to be a bit crispy on the outside. Yeah all of the pork belly in all the dishes looked like the fattiest piece of raw bacon in a pack of sugardale bacon. Disgusting. We also got the Garlic Porky wings, bad choice. They lacked garlic. There was Nothing on them. I saw them in a picture on here and they looked delicious. I got a fatty piece of chicken with nothing on it. Gross. I posted a picture compare what I got to the picture of the ones I thought I was getting. My boyfriend had the octopus stir fry. He said it was okay. Not the best udon noodles. We will be sticking to superior Pho for our Asian noodle dishes. I am quite thankful I had a healthy choice microwave meal in the freezer."}
{"text":"In my opinion this Noodlecat is more of a quick, last minute decision for lunch. Cashier was extremely helpful in explaining everything on the menu. It does have a very plain feel to it; which is surprising from being in a location as Crocker Park. The food was decent, but I was not too happy about the size of bowls you are served in. The broth had flavor to it but the meat almost seemed to be shredded paper. Flavorless and bland for the most part. But the one major part I'm missing is that after consuming Noodlecat from this location, make sure there is a bathroom near by. Let's just say my friend who went with me had far less than a 1 star experience."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Beef Short Rib with Udon Noodles and the Fried Chicken and Burger Steam Buns. The cold Sesame Noodle Salad is also amazing. Sit at the bar for the best service and some really creative and delicious cocktails."}
{"text":"I recently re-tried Noodlecat via UberEats... and they totally deserve an added star. The delivery was SO fast right before lunch (which was very surprising). They did a really excellent job correctly filling all 3 vastly different orders. The broth on the Korean Short Rib was really delicious, flavorful and proportioned correctly. I can't explain it, but it just all hit the spot. I would absolutely order this again via UberEats.  Everyone loved what they had. I took a bite of my friends Pork Miso, and the pork was tender and juicy. The broth was really complementary and super slurpy, which is what Noodlecat is known for. I really sense they are making some changes here, and cheers to hoping that on my next visit i'll be able to add another star!"}
{"text":"Yikes. Not too sure about all the vitriol towards this place. I found it to be a charming and (at least during Happy Hour) inexpensive place to get some non-traditional Japanese \"fast food.\"   For appetizers, we got hot wings and sake -- a hellacious combination if there was one. Had I not been with friends and wanted them to think I have better taste than I have, I might have stuck with just that. But I got the vegetarian special of the day, a huge bowl of perfectly seasoned and cooked noodles with squash, broccoli, other assorted fresh-ass vegetables and awesome hot sauce. My friends got the non-special-of-the-day ramen, which looked pretty great as well.   I think maybe some people want this place to line up with their feeling of \"This is what I'm used to from a Japanese restaurant.\" For me, the whole reason I frequent places like this is that they offer what I don't expect. Every day can't be Skittles and beer, kids."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a busy Saturday and the food was very good.  I really don't get the bad reviews for this place.  Is it the most authentic ramen place?  No, but it is damn good.  The steamed buns and gyozas are great starters and the noodles are great!  They have a decent beer list too. One thing that I don't like is their tofu.  It has a weird texture, most likely due to it being poached.  Other than that, the food is very good."}
{"text":"Check the menu before you go - if you don't eat pork, there were vegan options but not a whole lot else. While I do love a good noodle dish, the menu has limited choices for me."}
{"text":"I want here three times before I finally tried the pork miso ramen on the fourth. I had it again on my fifth visit. It is my favorite dish so far, I can see why is so popular. They also had a very good, spicy Szechwan chili ramen on the specials menu that should be added to their main menu, so if you see it, try it out! The Edamame is surprisingly good too...cooked with a nice salty, citrusy glaze.   This place is definitely pricy for ramen, but the bowls are creative with quality ingredients, so I don't mind too much. I also like going at lunch, when I can get a half portion (which is plenty!) at a reasonable price. As far as ramen houses in the area go, I think I like the overall atmosphere, menu, and bar at Ninja City better, but the pork miso ramen at Noodlecat is my favorite noodle bowl between the two."}
{"text":"Tried to give this place a shot while visiting Cleveland despite some of the mediocre reviews, and ended up completely regretting the decision. The dish that got me interested in trying out the place was the dan dan ramen, which ended up being a huge disappointment.  NOTE: None of these dishes -- despite their names -- are the equivalents of the Japanese dishes they are named after. They are this restaurant's take on them, which is a bit confusing for those that may be seeking the real deal, which I kind of was.  I ordered the okonomiyaki appetizer ($6), a tomato steamed bun ($3) and a dan dan ramen ($11 full size). All of the dishes came out at the same time first off, and I was hoping to at least get the okonomyaki or bun first but I guess the server didn't feel like asking what my preference was.  The okonomiyaki was some bastardized variation of this dish. Instead of a pancake, it was a crepe with some carrots and other vegetables inside. I was a bit taken aback by it, as I expected something more along the lines of... well, a pancake.  The steamed bun was not really a bun as much as a folded over dough with a tomato inside. Nothing memorable about it, and quite small compared to a regular filled bao.  The worst offender was the dish I was most looking forward to; the dan dan ramen. See, the menu doesn't really make it that clear that some of the dishes listed under the 'noodles' portion of the menu are just that, noodles. No soup broth to be found in the dan dan ramen, as you would expect from any 'ramen' or 'udon' in Japan. I probably wouldn't have minded this as much if the noodles were not devoid of any flavor other than salt. The taste was so utterly bland I didn't even bother to finish the \"full-size\" yet small portion that I received. There was barely a hint of a peanut taste aside from the peanuts themselves. When the server came back around to ask me how everything was I told her everything but the food was good, which I don't think I've ever done actually. This was just THAT bad.  I truly don't understand how this place is getting such good reviews. I have been in Japan multiple times and have had amazing flavor-rich dan dan ramen there on many occasions. This was just a disgrace to the dish. I can only assume most of the people that are visiting this place have not actually traveled anywhere that these dishes can be had with an authentic preparation."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I thought it was a fantastic change of pace to the same old food that you normally have. We had the brussel sprouts as an app and I liked them, my husband was not as big of a fan. My husband had a brisket bun and I was not a fan of that, someone else in our party had he onion bun and it was amazing. I would go back for that alone. The sauce on it was so wonderful.   So for our entrees I had the dan dan with roast pork and a soft boiled egg. I thought it was so wonderful. The sauce is a bit sweet, but they had a spice sitting on the table and that was quite spicy, so the combo was fantastic. The roast pork was really great too, done perfectly with tons of flavor. Some other people on our group got the chicken and was not as impressed. My husband got the spicy octopus and I thought the flavor of the sauce was spectacular, if you like spicy which we do. The octopus, which my husband thought would be overdone, was quite tasty and done very well. His noodles were a lot thicker than mine and I think I liked my thinner noddles better, but his were still done perfectly for being larger.   Even tho this place is almost an hour from me, I will absolutely be back. I loved the atmosphere, there really weren't many people there. The service was more than impressive, our server knew a lot about the menu and was able to give suggestions. I feel like people that don't enjoy this place must go in with bad reviews in their head bc everything I had was superb and I can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Ok.  I went there before and had a good experience..this time it was aweful..  We went on a Sunday and they have great deals.  I dont know why restaurants hire these hipsters that care too much about how tight their pants are and how many perfectly placed tattoos they have.  Guess these are rich kids who have never had to never had to work until now.  She walked up, never said Hi or anything.  We just told her what she wanted and she nodded and walked away.  The girl she was training was way nicer...but not much..  Took 15 minutes to get our beer and I accidentally dropped a spice, shaker thingy off the table and it broke on the sidewalk.  I told Johnny tight pants about it and he said he would \"get someone to clean it up\".  A broom would of taken care of it in like 5 seconds.  Needless to say it sat there broken the whole time we were there and people walking down the sidewalk had to walk through it.   Places need to hire people who want to work..instead of how they look.  I would rather have a sloth bring me stuff..as long as theyre somewhat quick and cordial!  Add this to another place I wont go downtown...what a shame..."}
{"text":"Great food- stopped in for lunch and to drop off blankets.  Octopus was good spicy that builds and the Super G-free Salad w Kale and quinoa was Fresh and tasty. Food was late coming to the table- staff was friendly but needs more training."}
{"text":"THE SKINNY: Noodlecat is Cleveland's fledgling, whimsical gastropub interpretation of Japanese-style ramen and miscellaneous Asian-fusion apps.  NOTE: emphasis on the Cleveland interpretation.  Flavor combos, while guaranteed to intrigue, are hit or miss--take that whichever way you will, but I'm inclined to be positive and say I'm excited and hopeful to witness Noodlecat's evolution.  PROS: Novelty (first Cleveland-ramen fusion joint ever woot); super friendly, down-to-earth staff; decent beer selection (Hitachino love!); killer wings and fried chicken (provided in the Roscoe's ramen, nomnom!); incorporation of local produce and items from local businesses (ahem OHC Pasta!); chic, sleek modern decor; reasonable Happy Hour deals; probably the only place in CLE where you can enjoy Cartoon Network while you slurp noodles (Adventure Time at dinner!  Hollaaa!)  CONS: Overpriced for the not-so-Happy Hours; flavor combos are novel but clearly in the works; noodles and noodle broths tend to lack complexity and umami; soy-braised egg's too salty. --- THE PART YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT: THE GREAT CLE NOODLE CONTROVERSY OF 2011-12 The above said, I feel the need to address the rift and sadly, vitriol expressed by both sides of the \"OMG Noodlecat is an effing FAKE! v. SHUTUP you ELITIST hipster ASIANS and ASIANPHILES how dare you have a reason to lord it over people who haven't had \"authentic\" ramen!\" controversy.  Really you guys, c'mon. Let's graduate from the 3rd grade namecalling and throw a nice, old-fashioned blind-drunk pub brawl.  Like civilized adults.  Settle this once and for all.    I. \"OMG Noodlecat is an effing FAKE\": As someone who's had \"authentic\" Japanese-style ramens (yeah, there's like, 13+ different regional styles of ramen in Japan you guys) in Los Angeles and as someone who's grown up on cuisines that practically consider noodle soup a food group (like hamburgers are to American cuisine), yeah, if I judge Noodlecat by those standards, it's a serious letdown.  Tremont Taphouse's ramen is an inch closer to the \"real deal\".  But let's be honest: it's not fair to apply those standards to Noodlecat.  Like going to one of those (godawful) Chinese buffets and rating them on the authenticity of their pizza.  Or trying to rate Chipotle or Taco Bell's menu on \"authentic\" Mexican food standards.    In defense of the ramen \"elitist\" camp--initially, when Noodlecat opened, emphasis WAS put on the incorporation of \"authentic\" straight-from-Japan ramen styles.  (Which it emphatically is not.) (Hey remember that cutesy promotional/introductory video on Noodlecat's website when they first opened?  Did you catch that one of the \"Sawyer in Japan\" scenes was filmed at local Cantonese noodle joint, Wonton BBQ and Gourmet?  Funny ish, right?)  Expectations ran high and the noodle soup/ramen-savvy crowd cried false advertising.  Dashed to a million pieces were the hopes of the ramen-craving masses.  Understandably.  You promise me home-made ice cream and give me canned spinach instead, you betcha I'm going to be pissed.    I'm guessing the gaff stemmed from either a marketing oversight or Sawyer miscalculated the recent influx of students/professionals who've settled in Cleveland from other cities with a bigger Asian food scene.  But since they've opened, Noodlecat's shifted its emphasis to the CLE interpretation aspect of their menu, so ramen-elitists, consider yourself forewarned.  This ain't Daikokuya or Shinsengumi, nor does it want to be.  If you want \"real\" noodle soup, walk 20 seconds around the corner for some pho at Saigon on East 4th and stop crying.  II. \"SHUT UP you stupid elitist ASIANS + ASIANPHILES\": As someone who's never been shy to try new cuisines and who's grown to love Cleveland's distinct food scene (how can anyone with tastebuds not??), I understand the other camp's defensive outrage.  Jonathan Sawyer is one of CLE's darling homeboys and I appreciate his willingness to blend and try to create something new.  It's an organic, local, and native endeavor.  Supporting Noodlecat literally supports Cleveland business and other specific Cleveland businesses.  How cool is that?  Pretty effing cool, that's what.  However, the fact of the matter is, Sawyer's trying something pretty ambitious, where very few people have succeeded before: that Frankenstein of noms, Asian fusion.  Another CLE Asian fusion joint, Bac in Tremont is outstanding but most of the fusion is inter-Asian (Vietnamese and Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese, etc.). It's when you try to blend vastly different Western/European cuisines with Far East ones, things can get a little rough.  And it unfortunately shows in Noodlecat's noodle soup dishes.  Many of the flavor combos don't quite work/may be a little too jarring.  The broths tend to be bland and/or one-dimensional and the noodles lack texture.  Final verdict: Noodlecat's menu has definite potential but currently lacks oomph.  And I'm hopeful that oomph is arriving sometime soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was sort of disappointing. We started off the meal with an order of takoyaki and what we got were 4 small balls of batter with maybe some octopus shavings on top? I'm not even sure. All I know is that I felt like I was just eating balls of pancake batter. Not a good way to start but  hey, this is a ramen house. Hopefully the ramen would be better.  It was... but really, that isn't saying all that much. I got the tsukemen ramen and was fairly underwhelmed. It had some decent flavors going on but it wasn't really what I was going for. The portion was decent enough though. I've had much better ramen at other places (although sadly Cleveland is pretty lacking in that department).   My friend got the soba noodles and man... they were whoa salty. The fried vegetable tempura that came with it was pretty delicious though. The rest of dish was pretty difficult to finish though cause of the massive salt content.   Overall, the food was less than stellar. I had no problems with the service, which was good, but sadly I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Was very good, fresh healthy food!  Loved the buns!!  Clean restaurant and fast service!!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a conference and decided to come here for lunch. The place was nice and clean and the waitress was super friendly. The foods, however, were awful. I orders the pork miso ramen and it was horrible. The noodles were too chewy. The soup was completely flavorless. I added so much hot sauce and soy sauce.  I also ordered the chicken bun and that was also flavorless. Definitely will not come back!"}
{"text":"to begin with they have one of the best happy hours in town...   first you must try the steambuns they are all wonderful even the vegi option...  great place to take a large group of people for happy hour...  this summer 6 of us came for there pig dinner and it was amazing...  they also host many of the brick and mortar dinners in the area...  ps please get diet soda"}
{"text":"Very interesting place to eat - definitely worth a try!  Menu is heavy to Japanese noodle dishes - very little American food on the menu.  The atmosphere was fun.  Prices are a little more expensive than you might like since most things are alacarte.  The noodle dishes are well done.  The steamed buns are worth a try.  The burger bun was very good!  The wings were okay - only 3 for $6 though.  The pickle platter was very good - great taste and presentation.  Our service was great.  The waiter was well informed and helpful with the menu.  The drink selection is interesting - lots of unique beers and sake."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Noodlecat since it was introduced to me last year but I have to say my most recent experience was so subpar that I won't be back anytime soon.   I got the pork miso, and my mother ordered the short rib. We both opted for steam buns, which were my recommendation because they've always been the highlight of dining there. Our order took forever to get to us, even though we were one of only 3 parties in the entire restaurant (one of which already had their food) and when it finally came out we had to remind our server that he had forgotten our steam buns.   Our soups were lukewarm at best, her short rib was terribly tough and the pork in my pork miso was almost all fatty, slimy meat. The noodles were extremely underwhelming which surprised me because they've always been delicious, but our server alerted us they started making their noodles in house recently and pretty much everyone has been unhappy with them. My mom described the consistency like a spaghetti noodle, nothing at all like what you would expect from a ramen dish.   Although the cab burger and fried chicken them self were delicious and fresh, the actual steam buns were stale.   Our server overheard us talking about how unhappy we were with our meal and when he approached us about it we told him that our soup was cold, the noodles lacking, and that the meat we were served was pretty inedible. We were asked to fill out comment cards but not offered any type of discount for our poor experience nor offered to have anything remade. You would think that since he overheard us complaining about how bad everything was that it would have been offered to be remade.   I'm giving two stars only because I've been there before and have had good experiences. Hopefully they get their act back together."}
{"text":"Based on the bleeeh reviews of Noodlecat I have to say I was a bit intimidated to try it, but I was in the area for a show on East 4th and had a noodle craving so the stars aligned.   Luckily, we were also there during happy hour and $1 beers cannot be beat! The happy hour listings seem to vary between online and in restaurant (mainly half bowls- are these a thing??). Picklebacks are on the happy hour menu and I probably would never do that again. Luckily I had that $1 beer to chase my chaser with.   The menu was actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be and a lot of the items seemed more fusion based than \"authentic\" which might be a pro or a con depending on your preferences. We ordered the Pork Miso and the Hangover Ramen and were both very happy with them. Nothing makes me happier than soft eggs and noodles.  We were one of the only tables there which felt odd since it was basically prime dinner time but I guess on weeknights downtown probably isn't too crowded. We had two servers due to shift change and the first girl was remarkably better than the guy that replaced her. I feel bad because we were about 5-10 minutes before getting our checks when she left and then the new guy let us sit for a half hour before showing back up.   All in all I would definitely come back to try some of their other options!"}
{"text":"I've only had great experiences eating at Jonathan Sawyer's restaurants (including a few visits to noodlecat)...both food and service. But last week the streak ended :(   We walked in and stood by the door for a couple of minutes...then went by the bar to see if I could find a server to ask whether or not we should seat ourselves. Finally tracked someone down and was informed to sit wherever. We picked the least dirty table (all 3 available tables were dirty). Filled out our sheet (think Barrio), including our drinks. We both ordered Moscow Mules, which was served in a tiny rocks glass with about 5 ice cubes. What?!? Drank it anyway, because, alcohol. Flash forward 20mins...still waiting for our food. And water. Flagged down a server...who gave us a carafe of lukewarm water from another table. Waited another 5 mins to ask for ice. Finally got our food, and I was missing my steamed bun. The food runner said he'd get it for me. Our ramen was good. Nothing spectacular, but we both enjoyed it. About 10mins later the bun comes out...to the table behind us. Food runner told us that they can't give it to me because it was already on another table, and it's against their policy. And that he'd get another one out ASAP. I understand, but it was going on about 15-20mins since we got our ramen. The table who had the bun asked if we wanted it anyway, since no one wanted it. Sure, I would love the food I ordered 40mins ago!   I've been in the service industry for the past 7years, and understand people have off days. But the lack of basic service is hard to comprehend, especially at a Sawyer restaurant.  I hope they consider investing in signage at the front door so people know to seat themselves, instead of standing there for 5mins looking around for help (which literally every party did upon walking in)."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to find a ramen/noodle place for a while now and so after some searching I found Noodlecat. My boyfriend and I came in today and were pretty excited to try it out. We walked in and seated ourselves. The decor and atmosphere is nice, and the server was nice. We filled out our order sheets and chatted as we waited for our food.   We each ordered a steam bun. I got the tempura perch, and my boyfriend ordered the fresh bacon bun. They were very good, and I do recommend that if you go you try one. They're like a sticky, kinda of sweet folded bun, and they come with pickle, lettuce, miso sauce and something called power ketchup. Steam buns get a 5/5 from me.  I ordered the udon noodles with coconut curry tonkatsu and a 6 minute egg. My boyfriend got the house ramen with the pork miso. This is the part where I was disappointed.  The coconut curry tonkatsu comes with tofu, kimchi, potatoes, cilantro, and I'm pretty sure there were slices of jalapeno in mine. Well, first off, the tofu was... bland and kind of gross to be honest. I would've thought that maybe they'd at least saute it with some garlic or something to give it flavor. But it was just cubes of bland, soft, nothingness. Now, you'd think that the broth would help flavor the tofu, but it didn't. The broth tasted like all they did was throw together some coconut milk and red curry paste. It would've really benefited from a squeeze or two of lime juice, maybe a few shakes of some fish sauce. Something. Anything. There is soy and what I believe to be buffalo sauce at each table, but no plain salt or pepper. I did throw some soy sauce on my tofu in an attempt to be able to manage to choke it down without gagging. But I just wanted to have some regular salt to put in the broth. Our server was very kind and brought out a little cup with some salt in it from the kitchen for me to use. It helped, and I was able to mostly finish my bowl. The noodles themselves were great. They had the perfect texture, and I enjoyed slurping them up (even though I ended up flinging broth everywhere. Oops...). I also really enjoyed the 6 minute egg, as I am a fan of runny egg on many things. Too bad they don't offer nori as an add-on 'cause I'd be all about that life.  My boyfriend's Ramen and pork miso was good. He enjoyed it very much and finished it in record time. I tasted the broth and thought it was a bit fatty, but no big deal.   The next time I go, I do believe I will get the charred spicy octopus and see if that sways my rating at all, but as of now I'm giving this place a 3/5. I will update my review if it changes."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  I now present to you the hitchhiker's guide to having a decent experience at this restaurant at the end of Euclid:  1) Go for happy hour.  Everything is half off!  2) Order buns!  Be aware that the \"buns\" are actually sandwiches similar to gua bao (google that term).  The BBQ pork bun had a large fatty chunk of pork belly (pro or con depending on how you see it), but the sauce had a nice flavor and a bit of kim chi adding just a touch of spice.  The tonkatsu bun had too much sauce but the pork was cooked well.  3) If you must order ramen, order the Takahashi ramen.  Be aware that the ramen is not traditional ramen like you would get from a ramen place in California.  Think of it instead as a simple noodle soup with nice home-spun Ohio City pasta. Don't drink the broth - the flavor is not right and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.  And don't expect too much meat in your soup.  4) If you order a salad, ask for them to go easy on the dressing.  Our salads (the choi soy and the \"super\" salad) had too much dressing, drowning the veggies and making them taste too salty or vinegary.  5) Order the chocolate peanut butter banana steam bun for dessert.  This was very good!  6) Enjoy the service.  Our waitress, Shandra, was courteous and helpful and also made some light conversation.  7) Voice your opinion.  Write a yelp review.  Seeing their responses to the other yelp reviews, I can tell that they are trying to improve and welcome your critiques.  And for example, previous yelp reviews speak of the saltiness of the broth but none of us thought the broth in our ramen was salty.  Maybe down the road Noodlecat will get better.  8) Don't forget your towel!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert about Japanese food or noodles, but when I'm pretty sure I can make a better bowl, I'm worried.  I tried the soba duri, with buckwheat soba noodles, tempura fried veggie cake, scallions and bonito. The broth was pretty bland, the bonito didn't add much flavor, and the veg cakes would have been better in smaller sizes (they were crumbling apart once they hit the soup). But my main issue was that I had most of these ingredients in my cupboard at home (soba, memmi and tsuyu sauces, hot spice, etc.), yet I was paying $11 for it here. Maybe other soups were better, but I left the restaurant unimpressed.  I will say, though, the buns are worth trying. Very tasty. Skip the noodles and have buns and beer instead."}
{"text":"Great concept!  Way more exotic sounding than what it actually is.    During my recent short stay in Downtown Cleveland, I was with a dear friend who likes her burger and steak \"plain, with no sauce what so ever\";  I thought this might be a great choice for us.  I was right.  I was able to convince her to order a few of those fun buns.  She chose the \"burger\" and the fried chicken filled buns.  She LOVED them both!  What's not to like?  Burger patty with great sauce; fried chicken with another great sauce, both tucked into that slightly sweet, yeasty, pillowy steamed bun...mmmmmmmm.  None of the sauces were acutely seasoned.  I also liked my choice of the sausage patty with bun.  Those buns make the best happy hour snacks!  They are about the size of a slider, so you can order a few of each kind to share.    The rest of my meal was not so great.  I did not like those \"porky wings\".  I have no idea what makes them \"porky\".  The meat was a bit dry.  I think the wings have been precooked prior to the grilling.  They just did not have the great bite that comes with freshly grilled wings.  Then I had to try the ramen, too.  My half size order of roast pork ramen was quite boring.  If you grew up eating Asian ramen, fresh or instant...this place will disappoint you like it did me.  The noodles were not chewy, the roast pork was in shreds...the broth tasted like soy sauce only...I can't go on.   So...great buns! great happy hour prices!  Great location, right around the corner from Public Square.  The rest...meh..."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to celebrate my buddies great Marathon finish and I was completely turned around on my feeling on this location.   Our server, Fred, was GREAT and the food was wonderful. I had the special - a dragon noodle bowl. Had some crispy fried chicken in the broth... not sure what else, but it was damn tasty. I added a half avocado to it which is always a winner in my book. We shared a Okonomi Yaki which was just incredible - wonderful blend of flavors. That set the tone for a great meal.  Enjoyed my soup with a side of broiled rice balls (wrapped with seaweed and some wonderful spices). Their beer list is really good now - enjoyed a decent IPA which went perfectly. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Spicy, nice service, and right by my conference hotel. Lots of vegetarian and some vegan options."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the new Noodlecat at Crocker Park yet, please GO NOW.   I had the cauliflower curry udon bowl which was phenomenally delicious! It was creamy yellow curry goodness with sweet potato, peas and carrots. The noodles were perfectly pillowy, and the spice level was right where I like it (medium). Of course you can add spice with some Power Catsup (code name for Sriracha!). Everyone there was smiling and helpful, especially Chef Sawyer who bagged our to-go order himself.   I have all the heart eye emojis for this new spot & can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Had the pork miso ramen (they have a lot of other unusual non-traditional ramens) and a BBQ pork bun and onion & burger bun. Both ramen and buns were just OK but I am somewhat a ramen snob. This place would never survive in NYC, but hey, it's Cleveland. Certainly was a good value for the price (under $40 for 2)."}
{"text":"2 updates.  1. Came here a few days after November started, got a spicy ramen with the sauces on the side and a ramen with matzo ball. Trying something new both were good.   2. Came here a few days later after the movies: The pork miso ramen was saltier than I remembered... but the squid udon was quite excellent.   The best during happy hour! Taking some time to try new places with ramen and a break from carbs~~ but so good for fusion.   Always ask for something on the side if you're unsure of flavor. Everywhere, no exceptions. Gives you customization options."}
{"text":"Based on a the surfeit of staggeringly positive reviews on Yelp (and my undying love and devotion for chef J. Sawyer's other downtown enterprise, the fabulous, incomparable Greenhouse Tavern), I felt obliged to throw my hat in the ring regarding Noodlecat, and let you know how awful it was on just about every level.   Food: On my most recent pick-up excursion to NC, I ordered Pork Miso Ramen, Smoked Tomato Coconut Curry Udon, and two buns (Ohio Cab and the Walleye, respectively). I was given the Pork Miso and three unknown buns which I didn't order. The Curry was unexplainably absent, despite the fact that the bartender read the order back to me on the phone.   The Pork Miso was cold as death. The nature of the broth could reasonably be compared to chicken soup concentrate some maniac took to frantically salting for no apparent reason. It is also worth noting that the dish was devoid of anything other than the noodles (sticky, tasteless), the broth, and a pitiful garnish. That's right. No egg. No pork chunks. Zippo.   As far as the buns--oh the buns!--a sort of crispy chicken and pork amalgam, miniscule in stature and underwhelming in taste, but not wholy unpleasant (a bit overpriced at $3 each, however: they are virtually 'two bite' affairs).   The food was also served with an ominious half-full cup of brown soup that I cannot place and am fearful was actually leftovers from another diner's meal.   For those keeping score: 1. Noodlecat messed up my order ( the second time this has happened n.b.) 2 The food was cold/tasteless (unless you count the destructive salt bath as 'flavor') 3. I suspect I was served the icy remains of someone else's dish on accident.   Atmosphere:  The decor of Noodlecat is handsome and Modern. Promiment and eye-catching anime-esque prints of the titular feline adorn one wall, giving the diner the aspect of eating their noodles inside of a giant comic book. There are only uncomfortable grade-school art room style stools upon which to sit, however, so make sure to exercise your back muscles before eating here. The music tends to be decent (if high-pitched) indie pop jams which eventually blend together. The bar is fully-stocked, but very, very small--arrive early if you wish to sit there.   Service: No one was at the podium as I entered and I had to flag a beleagured and put-up sever who directed me to the bar. I located the bartender in the back, glowering at his cell phone for about five minutes without looking up. When he finally served me, he was markedly curt. Generally, it would seem the NYC feel of the place (at least in theory) has infected the staff such that they mistake a chilly elitist veneer for quality service.    Closing: I wanted to like Noodlecat. I really, really did. I know this place has its slavish acolytes who would find my above review offensive on a dozen levels. To them I say, look guys I've tried to give the place a fair shake, believe me! This is my third attempt!  I may even stumble back in on some occasion in the future. But for now, I just can't figure out where all the good reviews are coming from. You're a beguiling mistress Noodlecat. One day perhaps you'll share with me your true, alluring charms."}
{"text":"Agree with Cara L.  We came for salty, tangy, flavorful, steamy bowls of noodles and left with bellyfulls of exactly that.  I don't understand walking into somewhere already knowing exactly which other restaurant/food truck/Manhattan street corner you want to be reminded of and being upset when the professional chef has different ideas.    The steamed bbq pork bun was unique (it's the same dough as a usual steamed bun, but more like a little pita bread in function) and had a really unique umami-BBQ thing going on.  Yum.  I want more.  I think the complaints and low ratings due to price are uncalled for- you see the prices before you order, you know you're dropping ~ $13 for noodles in a bowl and if it isn't worth it to you, hop off of your stool and head out the door.  We felt satisfied and the portions were spot on- husband ate his whole bowl and regretted the last several mouthfuls when desert came, I ate half and have plenty for lunch tomorrow.  We had the college noodles and Matzoh ball noodles.  I loved my college noodles (hooray dried corn, oh the 2am memories), wasn't as big a fan of his but it was a matter of personal taste rather than cooking.  The broth tastes like actual broth made from simmered bones.  Yes it's greasy (just a little) and has some strength to it- that's why it tastes like yummy soul-hugging deliciousness rather than salty yellow water.  There was plenty of meat, and remember it's Noodlecat, not Meatycat.  The focus was noodles and broth.  We had fun with the music and relaxed vibe.  We didn't care for the chocolate peanut butter desert, ours was just meh.  My only complaint is that while the server was fairly attentive during lunch, she dropped the check and totally disappeared despite us being the only remaining table.  We ended up leaving cash, and more than we would have liked, just to get the heck out of there finally.  Looking forward to trying everything else, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am SO SAD this place closed. Thankfully there are other locations. This place was actually nice but really was kinda tiny for downtown.  My coworker wanted to come here because he had been here before. He said hey, let's try noodlecat!  I have to eat gluten free now (even though I don't always). But it was nice to see that they have gluten free options. I didn't see that till AFTER I ordered my ramen.  I'm never going to be able to eat the packaged crappy ramen ever again after eating this. There is SO much to eat too. And filling. Real chicken in it. The only thing I didn't like was the freeze dried veggies in it. They were kinda hard, however I just ate around them because the rest was just amazing. I drank all the broth because I didn't want to waste it by throwing the rest out.  The waiter there Alex was awesome! We had a nice conversation. He was friendly, checked on us and didn't treat us like we were just money to him. He literally had a convo with us while working. It was great! The place was clean. We are at the bar because it was just convenient. Not that any of this matters now because this location is closed, but there are others! Give it a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food itself was great.  Great temperature, prompt, ridiculously tasty.  Man I love ramen.  My friend with me is vegan and was thrilled with the choices available. They are noodles and broth... Messy!  Not recommended on a date. Our waitress lost them a star.  She was slow and did not explain very well.  \"Well it has like veggies and stuff?' What that mysterious 'and stuff'?!?"}
{"text":"Hmmm.... Where do I begin. I know people who crave and love Noodlecat. Then, I know people who find it subpar. I'm just right in the middle. Noodlecat has offerings that I have yet to find in other places. For instance, all the buns. So of course, I head here to fulfill those cravings. Deep down though, I just know they are very basic in their delivery. I've had bigger and better elsewhere. Also, I find their soup bases to be very salty - and this is coming from someone who LOVES SALT. Furthermore, I find their offerings to be limited. If this place is going to be known as a ramen place, they need more ramen options!   So overall, while a solid staple to keep in mind, I would jump ship in an instant if a new Japanese/American fusion restaurant option popped up."}
{"text":"Stood there for about 10 minutes and the lady just danced around. I just wanted to take out. It wasn't even busy... I was in there sitting with my son ready to order to go and it never happened. I walked out. There was one person standing at the bar. This is a seat yourself place and they have papers for you to be ready. I was ready and waiting... Waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced for the portion sizes...maybe the happy hour specials are a little too happy? I dunno. I had the walleye bun ($4) and the chickpea gyoza-dumplings ($6). I made my own sauce at the counter of hot sauce, soy sauce, and some of the pepper powder/flakes, and with my sauce the gyoza were quite tasty. I thought the food was good, not outstanding, but that the prices were high. If my tiny piece of fried fish on a flat biscuit was $3 I would've been ok with it. It's $2 during happy hour, and that's a great deal. Presentation was good though.   I like the way the place looks...I feel like I'm in a science lab. Science labs are a comfort zone for me. I like the metal stools, I like the counter that looks over the street...I was able to watch people while I ate.   I was unimpressed with the service. The hipster waitress with her face piercings was lovely to look at, but seemed confused that she was supposed to wait on me. \"Are you going to order food or are you just looking?\" um...this is a restaurant...I came here to eat. \"Here.\" when she sat my food down. When I finished eating, and started looking around for my check, I noticed she was lingering nearby, purposefully watching me, but she didn't approach until I signaled for my check. It was just...weird. It was like I'd wandered into her apartment or something.   Overall, I would return during happy hour, or if they just made the food about 25% cheaper across the board. It was quick too."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no explanation for why this place is busy. Service was very slow and the food wasn't remotely warm when it finally did arrive. I had the short rib ramen and the meat was very fatty and tough.  I find it hard to believe that this is a Jonathan Sawyer establishment.."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place. The steamed buns were nice and pillowy, but the fillings were lackluster. The pulled pork miso ramen was delicious and was nice and garlicky. The fried chicken with the maple sriracha was also very good. But I only got two small nuggets and the chicken broth was pretty bland. Our waiter was outstanding and I appreciate that he refilled our waters several times and double checked on my nut allergy.   I think the biggest problem with this place is that they have removed the best umami flavors you expect in a bowl of ramen or steamed bun and subbed in some American flavors that just missed the mark."}
{"text":"I have tried quite a few bowls on the menu - pork miso, dan dan, short rib, octopus, and college.  I find the bowls to be either bland/boring or way too spicy.  They used to have a clam chowder bowl that was AMAZING, but unfortunately, they changed the menu and a lot of the old items are gone.  The steam buns are pretty good, but again our favorites are gone (beef brisket and pork).  We used to go before every home Cavs game, but we haven't been back yet this year - Bring the old menu back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, the disappointment!!! :( I fell in love with Noodlecat from my very first visit to the downtown location a few years ago.  That clam chowder... I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it was! Then they started changing the menu and recipes and every time they switched things up, we were more and more disappointed.  This last Noodlecat experience was by far the worst. Honestly, I don't know if I can go back.  I didn't even recognize the clam chowder bowl and the steamed buns have gone way down in quality.  I felt like the prices were too high for portion size and all the tables were dirty.   My husband and I each got one bowl and one bun and we both left hungry.  Please bring back the old Noodlecat!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta bump it up a star after a recent lunch visit. I went back with a larger party this time and got to try some new things, and I was really impressed. To start, we ordered the chicken wings, Japanese fried chicken bun, and pork belly bun, all of which were roundly praised. We all got noodle bowls next, and were thrilled by the depth of the broths and tenderness of the meat. My niece, who is exceptionally picky, barely came up for air from her Takahachi ramen. I tried ordering that as well, but there was a communication issue, and I received the college ramen. I ended up loving it and was glad that we all tried something different. They were kind enough to take it off of the bill, which was unnecessary but appreciated.  I still think that their prices could be adjusted down if they want to make themselves a place for regular lunches, but the place was packed, so I suppose I shouldn't worry about them too much. For the record, it looks like they have a kick-ass happy hour ($5 half-portions of ramen- yes!). I'll definitely be strolling down after work to try that out."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! While I consider myself an adventurous eater, my teenage son is most definitely not. We needed assistance navigating the menu and I repeated four times that he does NOT like spicy food ... only to be told where the Siracha bottles were located. While my son only ate a few bites, I ate my entire meal. As I write this from my bathroom, I won't go into detail explaining how my body is trying to rid itself of this meal. . Suffice it to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I loved the downtown version (prior to changing their ordering process & menu) and their west side market version... however this Crocker version... its two thumbs down for me! Everything on the menu are so overpriced!  Buns should be around $1.50-1.99.  I hate the way this place is set up and everything felt so cheap! I thought I was going to fall with that cheap plastic black chair!  I know it's new and trying something new but i don't think it's working.  Sorry! I really really loved west side market Noodlecat! The amount, ingredients, plus garnish, etc."}
{"text":"The cat logo is cute and the waitress we had was super nice but the food just didn't cut it.     Our(my 2 friends and I) first night in Cleveland, after settling in the hotel, we decided to walk around downtown to see what nightlife has to offer on that Friday night (10/21).  We were kind of hungry and saw this place, we decided to give it a try.   It was around 9:30pm but the place was kind of empty.   We were sat in the front, I think one or two other tables were occupied in the front as well.  I saw there was additional seating in the back.   There were a few people back there but it looked like they were working there or people who knew the people working there.  We ordered the twice cooked wings for our appetizer, porky garlic and miso bbq.   They were both good, but I wished they would have used real minced garlic for the garnish.   The garlic that they used was like a dried type and it didn't have that fresh garlic taste to it.    For my soup, I ordered the ramen with brisket and matzo ball....I only ordered it because I never had a matzo ball.  But it tasted exactly like how my friend describe it...bread in soup.  The brisket was not bad but I wished the soup had more something to it...it was missing something...I don't know.  My friend ordered the pork miso ramen....She wasnt too happy with it.  I tried it as well and was glad I didn't order it.  The plus was when the waitress accidentally told us about the West Side Market.   She was telling us about how the restaurant gets all their fresh produce from the WSM and we were like O_O, tell us more about this market.   We ended up going there the next morning and we really enjoyed it....So Thank YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave the place an honest shot.  I like the idea of fusion restaurants, but Noodlecat just manages to strike out all around.    The Decor The comic on the wall was sort of fun.  Apart from that, the place had the generic, oh-so-self-conscious hipster \"charm.\"  I had to keep reminding myself that this place wasn't a chain, and that the waiters weren't required to wear flair.  The whole place feels like the product of marketing research and sloganeering That, and why does it feel like I'm about to start mining coal?  A noodle joint should be bright so you can appreciate the color and contents of the soup.    The Service Can't complain about it.  They were prompt, polite, and competent.    The Food In a word, a disappointment.  We split a steam bun;  I can't say much.  It was decent.  The pork chop was crispy and well-seasoned, but apart from that, it was unremarkable, and I'm frankly surprised I even remembered it.   I had the squid udon noodles.  I'm reasonably sure it's a copy of a Korean dish, and honestly, not a good one at that.  It was like the VHS copy of someone's Blu Ray version;  the seasoning wasn't there, it was too dry, and the squid was overcooked and a little tough.   The noodles my companion got were salty and too thick.  The broth might as well have been gently-heated tap water;  it wasn't the right temperature to cook the noodles properly and was impressively bland.   The final insult came with the bill;  for half the price, we could have feasted over in Asiatown, and not felt like we were eating in a hipster's basement.    I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"So saddened by my experience with Noodlecat at Crocker Park. It was a fast food experience with fast  food cuisine. Got the pork miso noodles. Didn't come with a soft boiled egg, ordered two in my soup, extra charge no biggie. All of our eggs were more than hard boiled. And most of my noodles were congealed into a few large balls. And I saw the owner there so putting out that level of food must have been ok. Not a lot of noodle houses in Akron/ Cleveland, still ll not going back. Very sad"}
{"text":"Ramen Place.. in Cleveland?  This place has a hip and down to earth vibe, that serves reasonable priced bowls of ramen that are flavorful.   - Pork Miso Ramen: It was flavorful and basic. It has the simple additions of scallions, pork that is shredded, and the perfect egg.  All in all this place is a good spot for the area. The small ramen for $6 cant be beat, and is perfect for those with a small appetite."}
{"text":"I tweeted at the restaurant and whoever is in charge of the social media told me to contact the restaurant.  I called that same day (3/18) and explained to the person who answered what happened and that I was told to call.  He brushed me off and said \"my manager will call you back\"...10 days later...nothing.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"One of the worst noodle places.   We ordered 2 different ramen bowls, a soba bowl which also included tempura, 2 buns, 1 rice ball and a seaweed salad.  Only the buns would receive a passing grade at $3 per piece (fits in the size of a toddler's hand).  Anything involving noodles was a disaster especially the ramen.   The noodles taste like rubber and are undercooked.  The soba soup is basically soy sauce diluted with water.  The kale and daikon tempura were so salty that was giving us heart burn.  By the way, the rice used in the rice ball was cooked with too much water and was bloated and mushy.  The restaurant needs to learn how to make decent rice first.  Unfortunately there is no Noodles & Company here in Cleveland.  I'd rather go there.  This is worse cooking than a full time mom rushing making dinner on a bad day.  They lack the basic understanding in Asian noodles and rice - go label themselves as an Asian fusion restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised of some of the poor reviews.   A friend of mine who works right across the street from here told me about this place.  I was hesitant because of the reviews, but I tried it anyway.   First, I was really happy with the drink selection, primarily the beer. I'm not much for sake, so I enjoyed a delicious IPA.  Both my wife and I decided to go for a lunch combo so we could effectively try four items, two salads and two ramen.  My Kim chi salad was great. Very fresh tasting and outstanding flavor.  My wife's chopped salad was good, but was missing something to put it over the top.   As far as the ramen goes both dishes were wonderful. I got the more traditional of the dishes they had to offer, the pork miso ramen. The broth had so much wonderful flavor and depth and the pork was tender and perfect.  What might have been the best park for me was the sold boiled egg. It was a great touch.  My wife's dan dan was nice and spicy and the sauce was the star of the show here.   The ambiance is great, it very chill and I feel like I could just go here to hang out.  And the service was OUTSTANDING. We sat at the bar and the bartender was helpful, knowledgeable and fun. I hope he is there the next time I go. No question noodlecat will be in my future."}
{"text":"Pork miso is on point! Smokes Yuzu's salty slurp. I will definitely be going back, or have my wife pick up takeout weekly."}
{"text":"It's hard to judge a place like this that lacks the authenticity of a traditional ramen house, yet intentionally tries to push the creative boundaries and support local products.  My local Japanese restaurant has fantastic ramen and broth, so Noodlecat was a bit of a step down, at least for the shio college ramen and the pork miso ramen.  The BBQ pork and the brisket steam buns were delicious.  I'm glad this place exists, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't expect authenticity."}
{"text":"The only reason I went through the trouble of creating this account was to write this review. That's how important it is to me.  I have been a staunch noodle cat supporter since it opened, being there dozens of times. I work downtown and love your food. I also encouraged many people to go there because I liked it so much.  However since your reorg a couple months ago the restaurant has done a 180. There is no one there anymore and it still takes forever to get in and out with the new placemat menu, which is just a huge waste of paper. You now charge more for less food with your single bowl price and removed your best bun. I understand a price increase for superior quality but I get in and out of Hyde Park for the same amount of money and less time.   I think if you look through your recent reviews you will see most agree with me, (minus the guy from California but he is used to paying $20 for lunch) and I only write this in hope of change. I would really like to recommend your restaurant once again."}
{"text":"Ate there this past Monday night 4/16.   Food was fantastic, reasonably priced and good selection.  I had the Calamari and Udon noodles, great seasoning and flavor and a Walleye fish on steamed bun ...out of this world flavor.  Good crowd for a Monday, great vibe and interior and not loud so you can speak with your guest.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday for their all day happy hour which turned out to be a pretty good deal. We each ordered a noddle bowl and a steam bun and that was a pretty sufficient amount of food for a $7 dinner. My steam bun was delicious but the noodles (I ordered the Takahachi Ramen) were VERY salty and I felt VERY sick after eating them.  Other than that our service was decent and the others at my table seemed to enjoy their meals.   I would try it again and order something else (maybe stick with the $2 steam buns?) but only for their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Sadly, I must report that the decline continues. When I moved to Cleveland a year and a half ago, Noodle Cat was the first place I went to for lunch with my new work colleagues. Coming from D.C. and Columbus, which have amazing Ramen scenes, I was excited that there was a fresh looking and new option in town. Although my first experience wasn't the greatest--a rice bowl with Tonkatsu should have fired pork cutlet in it--I persisted in going back to try the other bowls.  Eventually, I fell in love with the Fiery Dan Dan with udon noodles.  I had to add pulled chicken sometimes but it's all good.   Then came Menu 4.0. Not good, not good at all.  I was told that the new menu was in place to diversify the menu as they prepared to launch a second location in Westlake.  My first problem with the new menu is that they claim the old menu is still available but it is not--except for maybe the college style.  The items that look the same--spicy octopus, beef short rib--have all new receipes and ingredients.  Today when a friend asked if the spicy octopus is the same as it used to be and received an affirmative response from the server.  I can assure you it is not.  The broth is completely different but the server was adamant that it was same and chalked up the difference to the chef.  Not likely. Second, I ordered the new Hangover Bowl.  Admittedly, it's very good.  Actually, it's the only one I like from the 5 or so I've tried on the new menu (Fried Chicken-meh 3 peices of chicken, a few strips of collard greens and noodles, Short Rib-thumbs down on the new broth, Sweet Potato Curry-bland, beer and bacon-where do I even start). Anyway, today I get my Hangover (third-time) and it's missing the 6 (or 8?) minute egg. I mentioned it to the server who apologized.  The manager (I assume) came to apologize (which, at first, I thought was a nice gesture since service has been pretty sketchy as of late) and proceeded to tell us they were out of eggs. I was going to accept that but she added that they actually have eggs but they weren't cooked and the kitchen was backed up. Then, she walked away.  It took me a minute to process what happened.  She just told me, yes, your order is not complete but we don't have time to make you an egg so deal with it. Oh and yeah, charged full price.   Well, after a year and half of going to Noodle Cat with peeps from work I'm done."}
{"text":"For a first timer, had to say that I enjoyed the beef. It had a little kick but the noodles give it balance. They have half and full orders so it depends how much you want! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Walked down the street to grab dinner. I've been in Cleveland for a week now and have tried most of the major hotspots. This little spot did not disappoint!   From the moment I walked in I was welcomed by a host and another server. I sat at the bar. The happy hour was offered but I picked my favorite Sapporo. I went with noodles and curry sauce with a side of \"fire\". Outstanding! I wish I would have come here for lunch on the days I couldn't decide and it was cold outside.   The portion was so generous, easily for 2 people. My husband will have the left overs after he gets home from work.   My server/bartender Shannon was a delight. She made great suggestions when I was unsure about which noodle to choose and she was sure to check on my drink status.   Over all a great fast bite but you can for sure lounge at the bar like I did and enjoy the music and the big screen tv."}
{"text":"Noodlecat was highly recommended by a lady I met on the train who was very savvy on restaurants in the area.  So I made it my mission to try it. Came here close to closing time and the place is definitely cool and charming! Perfect restaurant to be in when it's cold outside. Sat right away and our waiter was very attentive. I ordered the smoked beef brisket ramen and my friends ordered the pork bun. I was shocked of how big the dish was and really hot. The noodles to be honest were kind of bland but very soft and plentiful. But the brisket, was awesome. Pork buns were really small for the price.  This restaurant is in the $10+ range but the noodle dish portions were humongous.   Overall,  i really liked it.  I gave it a 4/5 because this restaurant is one of those cool unique bucket list restaurants you gotta try out at least once. But I wouldn't come running here if I were hungry and want to eat a big hearty meal. Never really been a fan of Japanese food but that's just me. Maybe you'll like it. I would however bring guests here and recommend for the experience!"}
{"text":"I've never come closer to swearing in a Yelp review than I am right now.  I'm a HUGE ramen fan. My favorite two restaurants in DC and NYC, respectively, are Toki Underground and Momofuku.....there's zero substitue for a good bowl of lip smacking, salty goodness with pork products.  Noodlecat was recommended to me as a fantastic new Cleveland spot. Well trained chefs, gorgeous restaurant, inventive twists on the classic.....and steamed pork buns. (Not always so easy to find the latter, I couldn't wait to try it out)  The menu looked a bit on the pricey size when I sat down, but I tried not to let that affect my opinion. Good food is good food, no? (A little ridiculous that the price point is higher than any similar spot in DC, but still.....deep breaths)  We ordered from the \"happy hour\" menu, and each pork bun individually was 2$. The pork buns took a LONG time to arrive at our table, and our waitress seemed terribly unconcerned with our growing consternation. She mumbled at us any time we flagged her down for drinks, and seemed thoroughly put out that she was forced to bring us a beverage. It took about 30 mins for appetizers, and an hour-ish for the ramen to show up.  The ramen had a good flavor, but was nothing special. Very salty, in large helpings. The pork was cooked well, but the broth was just short of reaching the \"wow\" factor.  On a side note, I tried the college ramen at the Noodlecat booth featured in the West Side Market; much better service, and a far superior broth. The staff here was much more pleasant and attentive, even on a busy Saturday at the market. If I need to satisfy the ramen craving in Cleveland from now on, i'll definitely hit their booth instead, or wait for the next claimant to the throne. Until then......pfbbbbbbbtttttttt."}
{"text":"I loved Noodlecat during the days when they had a location in the Westside market. I'd make special trips there just to grab lunch to-go - the ramen was great!  However, over time the prices have continued to go up and the quality has gone down. Until now i thought the most pivotal point was when they changed their menu at the downtown location to move away from a true menu to more more aligned with a fast casual restaurant (1) pick noodle, 2 pick broth, 3 pick protein), however their new location takes it to a new level.    They've essentially become a Ramen Chipotle, but with smaller portions and higher prices.  On my first (and likely last visit), i ordered the Hangover Ramen.  For the quality and portion, I was shocked by the $13.99 price (had to known what i was going to get - or not get - i never would've ordered).  If you are craving ramen while at Crocker Park, this will do - but if you want better quality, better portion and overall better experience do yourself a favor and go to Xinji on Lorain/W 43 or to Bac in Tremont - they have less of a ramen selection, but better quality that Noodlecat."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to live up to the hype and didn't. Overpriced ramen, small portions, and terrible menu items. 15 dollars for a bowl ramen? What are you smoking? Friend ordered the chicken ramen and they literally put a drumstick on top of ramen covered in mostly broth, so what happened you ask? Well because it was fried chicken it got soggy. Really really gross man. I understand this is Westlake but still man we're not stupid this place isn't gonna last long. I'm sure tenants are lined up waiting for them to fail. 15 dollars for ramen? Lol I'm sorry I keep repeating that."}
{"text":"Short Version: Great Comfort food, Awesome Happy Hour, but can be Hit or Miss with people  My friends and I are deeply divided on our feelings with this place. I personally love it (as evidenced with how often I order from there), and order the Japanese Fried Chicken Steam Bun and Sausage Steam Bun with a half order of whatever noodles I feel like that day. It has yet to disappoint. I greatly appreciate that they are very flexible with subbing items in their meals. But my friends have felt differently, so it may just be an acquired taste or just meant for a certain adventurous kind of palate. I constantly go back. Service is pretty good, I've only had one bad experience, but I chalked it up to being new at that time.   I would definitely try this place if you haven't already and make up your own mind."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Had heard how great the vegan options here were, but I think they have scaled back their options since then. Ordered the house noodles with coconut curry. The noodles and curry were good but the add ons were really low quality. Seemed like they added leftover scraps in.   Saving grace was the speed in which it was delivered but when you get charged what they charged for a gimmick, I'd love to get more of an experience which I didn't.  Also got a cocktail which was pretty small for the price."}
{"text":"I got the miso ramen,and  the Ohio pork buns for my six year old. She ate two! This is not the place if you are looking for authentic asian flavor or preparation but the noodles and the pork were very good and fresh. Definitely a fusion approach. The ramen portion was hearty for the price and more noodle than broth. The pork bun is overpriced. The line was very slow. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I was very happy with this place, I ordered the pork Raman and my wife had the the special which was a bacon mushroom stir fry. this is definitely a Japanese American fusion not a traditional noodle house but if you go in expecting that it's great."}
{"text":"It's definitely got alot of hype behind it because all my friends wouldn't shut up about it. My fiance' and i love japanese food/culture so we gave it a shot. Took my brother and his kids so in all 3 adults and 2 kids. Their no added sugar ginger ale was great but bear in mind your not getting free refills on these 'sodas\" for your kids and two or three can add up fast. The place has a good ambience to it but maybe a little to hipster for my likes but i don't feel that should be counted against it. The green tea is great with honey and i feel it's a good value because it has free refills. If you're looking for a true Japanese beer steer clear of any Asahi beers and Sapporo premium as they are brewed in canada and the U.S. Other sapporos like the draft is a true import. I find it redundant to pay premium ale prices for something thats not a real import. That being said my fiance ordered one. My brother ordered i believe some sort of tempura ramen ? and my nephew ordered a beef ramen (which he loved) and my fiance and niece decided to share a new menu item which was a smoked tuna steak. They enjoyed it until they got near the middle where it was gooey and underdone (maybe should have been smoked longer or perhaps kissed a grill for a bit). I ordered an  Udon (my favorite) and it was pretty good. The food was great except for the problem with the tuna. Service was good but didn't check back on us as much as i would have liked. So 3 adults 2 kids and one adult and child shared a meal 3 sodas 1 green tea 3 steam buns 2 ramens 1 udon and the tuna dish all came out to around $100.00. So maybe not the kind of place people on a budget or with a family would frequent but it was a good one time experience for us just not something i think we will revisit. All that being said i encourage people to try it at least once for themselves and make up their own mind. But go easy on the drinks and the steam buns."}
{"text":"I don't know if words can do this place justice. In my mind, there is no place greater than Noodlecat. My coworker and I started going here last October in the midst of a work project from hell, and I think steam buns and sake may have been the thing that got us through the long hours we spent at the office through the end of the year. Without Noodlecat, I really think we wouldn't have made it.  First, everything on the menu here is wonderful. It's NOT just ramen. To say that Noodlecat is a ramen restaurant is blasphemy. They have noodles, salad, ramen, udon, rice, steam buns, apps, everything. I can honestly say that I have never tried something here that I didn't like.  My first dish ever was the spicy octopus udon stir fry. Spicy is not an understatement - it is HOT. But so good. The octopus is chewy, not fried like a calamari-type dish, so that may not suit everyone, but it's very good.  The Tempura Soba Dori is also fantastic, but be warned - it's a lot of food! I think there are three different plates that come with this one? And the egg-shaped mass that is on one of them is indeed just that - a crispy egg. It took us a minute to figure that out. You can mix the extras into your broth, or eat them all separate - there is no rule.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Ramen is a surprising combination, but one I would absolutely try again. Equal parts sweet and savory. Hard to eat with chopsticks, but worth it.  If you want something else, the salads are delicious. The Super Salad is my favorite, and it is incredibly energizing. After I eat it,  I always feel like I could run a marathon. Energy-level wise, of course. It doesn't strengthen your knees or ankles.  Pickle sampler app? Just do it. Noodlecat makes pickled food better than anywhere. The Edamame isn't bad, either. Just the right amount of salty.  And, of course, STEAM BUNS. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT STEAM BUNS. They are like magical little Japanese tacos and the bread is so soft it feels like a pillow for the filling. I think I've tried every bun, and they are all PERFECT. The fried chicken bun may be my favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of them. Come during happy hour with a friend, and you can get two steam buns for $5. Try out a few - you'll be glad you did! I want to be a steam bun for Halloween, I love them that much (that's a normal reaction to food you love, right? Just tell me it's normal).  Drinks here are great, too. They have house-infused sake on tap, and the infusion flavor changes every month - so far, the cranberry and the orange infusions have been my favorites. They also have Sapporo and a rotating draft beer on tap, as well as a large selection of beer by the can or bottle. Mixed drinks are also great, and they have a good selection of non-alcoholic beverages for anyone who doesn't want to or can't drink. Their Ramune Marble Soda's are really cool, as you have to pop a marble into the drink to break the seal. They are very sweet and sugary, but fun for kids! You can't get the marble back out, though, so no fear of choking.  Honestly, Noodlecat is the best. I think I'm here at least once or twice a month at the minimum, but it's my go-to for downtown happy hours, dinners with friends, and it's one of the first places I introduce out-of-towners to in the city. Go once, and you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"Amazing and strong flavorful ingredients... except for the extremely mediocre broth. What I got would have been so amazing if the broth wasn't so bland. Slightly disappointed in the ramen. The Japanese chicken bao was super good though! I recommend the baos here rather than the ramen !"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last Saturday evening and loved it. I got the college noodles and a steam bun sandwich and they were both delicious, especially the sandwich.  There's some hilarious comic strip art on the walls, and the music playlist is on point. If I lived in Cleveland, I'd be a regular of this place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the new noodlecat since I love the downtown location. Omg, I will never ever return. Horrible food, our chicken steam buns were so over cooked you couldn't bite into the chicken, the kids ramen tastes horrible and the blueberry boba tea was so sugary it tasted like straight up simple syrup. Our hangover Ramon bowl was so disgusting we took a bite and threw it away. I was so bummed out and shocked that I spent 50 bucks for such a horrible meal. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Good environment and very friendly staffs. However, their food is just bad. I didn't expect they have some super authentic Japanese ramen but this is worst than those awful American Chinese restaurant.  I do recommend having a drink here, at least they didn't homebrew their Sake."}
{"text":"Seriously does everything have to always be judged on how 'authentic' it is? Is it good or isn't it? Did you have good service or didn't you? Noodlecat is not pretending to be authentic Japanese cuisine. If you don't like the food, by all means leave a low rating, but not solely on 'authenticity'. I don't really get some of the pretty negative reviews overall. Oh well, when the haters stay away, there'll be more room for me!  Noodlecat is a very good, cheap place to grab a bite to eat downtown. Lunch is fast (they promise takeout in 15 minutes), but even sitting down it only took 30 min for us to be in and out.   The steam buns are great and at 2/$6 are a good value for a medium-sized snack. Half portions of the noodle bowl entrees are also only $6 and they are PLENTY big for me. I don't think I could eat all of the full $11 bowl even if I was pretty hungry. A half portion and two steam buns was plenty for all in our group to leave just right, not stuffed.   I highly recommend the Japanese fried chicken steam bun. Bomber. And with the even cheaper happy hour prices which are served all day on Sunday as well as happy hour during the week, really, what's not to like?  No, it isn't extremely authentic ramen but then again, it isn't trying to be. Cheap and yummy. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Let me start off with I don't like Ramen, but I like Noodlecat!  If you are going to be a noodle restaurant then this is how it is done.  I am already a fan of Chef Sawyer who also runs The Green House Tavern, so maybe I am biased.  I have been here a few times and I have tried a few different things each time.  The noodles are made fresh by Ohio City Pasta which you may know from their stand in the West Side Market.    The first time I went I decided to try sake.  I had no idea what I was ordering, so the waiter kindly game me hot vs. cold samples. and sweet vs. bitter samples.  I ended up deciding that I don't care for sake in any form, but they were so nice in helping me order and made great suggestions. I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes good food, even if noodles aren't your thing.    If your not familiar with the lingo, then that is no problem, they have a list of terms and definitions on their menu.  I highly suggest the fried chicken steamed bun, everyone at our table loved it! I would go there just for the steamed buns if I didn't like the noodles so much.    As an end note, they were playing reruns of Thundercats and various other old school cartoons on two large tv's while we ate. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Disappointed. This was my third time trying the Noodlecat and each time the concept has changed. The downtown location was SOO yummy. I didn't even mind spending 10$ on flipping ramon noodle soup... But this visit was by far the worst. I was expecting a sit down meal, like I had experienced before, but there was an ordering line... the weirdest thing is that it was set up similar to a chipotle where you would imagine you could build your own Ramon bowl (which would have been pretty cool actually) but instead you had only 6 pre-created bowls to choose from. I ended up getting shrimp dan dan noodles. Sauce was good but I literally got 3 baby fried shrimp that tasted stale in a sad plastic bowl. I really hate giving bad reviews, I just hope they can reformat things to stay in business."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is great and the food is amazing especially for the price some of the best ramen I have ever had the only thing that sucks is the service last time I was there me and my friends waited about 10 or so minutes and no one even came around so we ended up leaving which was really disappointing because it was some of their first times there and it set a bad impression hoping that this never continues or happens again but the food is really really good"}
{"text":"Wow well noodlecat moved from downtown and downgraded not a fan at all they went from a sit down place to pretty much a tiny Chipotle like place where you stand in line and really that much money for ramen in a paper to go bowl not  worth it at all this sucks because I was a regular at noodlecat and I loved how great it was downtown I even recommended it people it was great so sad to see it now."}
{"text":"Being such a fan of the Greenhouse Tavern and Chef Jonathon Sawyer, I couldn't wait to dine at Noodlecat.  Stopping in for lunch with unbridled enthusiasm, I eagerly informed my server I had never been there and if there was anything she could highlight.  After looking at me with a blank stare, she asked me what I wanted to drink.  Okay fine, I decided to go with the suspense and ordered a glass of sparkling wine.  While waiting, another enthusiastic newbie nearby asked her which Ramen she would recommend.  Her answer:  \"Its all pretty much standard\"?!?!  I realized at this point I was on my own and so turned to Yelp for some assistance.  I decided to choose the Ohio Pork Bun and the Takahashi Ramen.  I loved the Ohio Pork Bun...creatively delicious.  The Ramen and the noodles though seemed to be a bit amiss...too salty for me and the noodles chewy.  I found out later Chef Sawyer is using a Buckwheat flour base to make them healthier so I guess this is to be expected.  I really love supporting our local food scene and heard Chef Sawyer is going to be a contestant on the next Iron Chef Competition.  I am planning on going back for dinner sometime and try again...just hope they find a server who is as excited to be there as much as some of the patrons!"}
{"text":"Always good food. Everywhere on east 4th had and hour and a half wait. Walked right in here. The servers were hustling but just not enough people working to keep up with the rush they had or it would have been a 5 star."}
{"text":"Come in after being told multiple times the food is amazing. Clearly I should not listen opinions.   Out of basically every liquor on the menu on a FRIDAY evening. Turning people away at 7:55pm when the hours say open till 9. It is a Friday, it a busy, busy area!   Food, typically you order an appetizer, it comes FIRST.....not EVERYTHING at once. Felt extremely rushed and food was not at all hot! And for the bill to be 60 bucks. Rip off! A \"glass\" of Saki, was a glass too small for a child under 5 filled with juice. For $10! Rip off!  Terrible experience! Will NOT go back!"}
{"text":"The perfect winter lunch! Stopped here for a huge steaming bowl of ramen last week during my weekly westside market trip. I went with the miso ramen, I wish I could just order a huge cup of the broth because it was perfect! The noodles were from Ohio city pasta and everything worked well together. I was happy but there's so many good eats at the market and I'm sure the noodlecat restaurant is even better so now I cannot wait to head downtown and try the real thing!"}
{"text":"Worst experience. Waited an hour for our food. Messed up my order. Half of the things on the appetizer menu weren't available for Order"}
{"text":"ok - i admit it. I am not a lover of Asian food. When my boyfriend wanted to go to Noodlecat for happy hour, I was a little apprehensive. However, I'm glad we went.  Let me start out by saying that I love the concept of their happy hour menu. You can get almost any noodle dish in a happy portion for 5 bucks. Considering I have a small appetite, this portion is perfect for me. And I like that I can still choose from anything on the menu. I wish more restaurants would do this!  I had the fried chicken noodle dish. I guess it's hard to go wrong with something like this, but that said, it was fantastic. I didn't try the buns, although my booboo did and he loved everything he had.  The service was great as well. I think their space could use a little work, however. It'd be nice if it was more open, rather than there being a wall (or whatever it is, I can't remember) separating the bar from the dining room.  :) cheers."}
{"text":"We tried this today for the first time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even gave us an extra little slider sandwich for our patience for waiting a few extra minutes for fresh buns. Unfortunately the food was not good. I had the pork ramen- it was soooo greasy. I really wish there had been vegetables or something extra in the noodles. The prices were way too high for what it was and the menu was confusing and very limited. I'm so sad because I wanted it to be good."}
{"text":"I tried the Pork Miso Ramen and the Crispy Beef Short Rib Ramen. Both were very bland and I had to add soy sauce, hot sauce, and salt to the broth to give it some flavor.  The Fried Chicken steamed bun was pretty good. Service was mediocre - the waitress forgot about the drinks that we ordered and we had to ask to get our waters refilled. I was disappointed, though I may be spoiled from the amazing Ramen I've had in Chicago."}
{"text":"Pretty cool cat. Noodles were cold but tasty. Half portion sizes were good snack sizes.   Happy hour deal is only a dollar off. But hey, can't complain about that right?  If you like spicy... don't be cheap and hold out on the scorpion / ghost sauces. Apparently they get it from a local farmer and it totally changes the dishes! Do it and you wont be sorry (OR ... maybe you will be). Just dont blame me."}
{"text":"While the steam bun sandwiches were pretty good and my spicy Dan Dan was delicious, many other guests at our table were not as pleased.   The curry lacked flavor, the beer selection was mediocre and the service was subpar. We drove 40 minutes to Cleveland for this \"Japanese\" fare on recommendation from a friend because my boyfriend had lived in Japan and missed the cuisine. What we got was extremely Americanized and not at all what we expected.   Apparently there used to be more steam bun options and other flavored but for some reason they got rid of them."}
{"text":"Food is average; kinda bland actually.  Service was so-so. My recommendation is sit back near the bar for better service. If you sit up front near the street you'll be ignored. Waiter had zero personality."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this pleasantly creative little spin on noodle cuisines. We've only been there once and both had the San Francisco Surf 'n Turf and LOVED it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun and low-key. Our waiter was friendly, quick and very helpful. My friend and I shared an order of 6 buns. All of them were delicious, though the Fat Casual Smoked Turkey was by far my personal favorite. I also ordered the College Ramen which was good, but nothing to write home about. My friend had the Takahachi Ramen and loved it. Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is an Americanized ramen  place.Broth and noodles were not good.The only thing good here is the pork belly bao buns."}
{"text":"$10 for 2 buns and a salad = worth it.  I recommend the Super Salad. It's not a ton of food but if you are at WSM and need to eat something to clear your brains before over purchasing un-prepared food, it's the way to go."}
{"text":"Noodle Cat is a decent place  Service can be quite slow at times. And to make matters worse, the restaurant is small. I would advise coming in on Sundays or during lunch when their isn't a crowd in Crocker Park. At least the staff made up for the long wait by giving me a 10 dollar off coupon. But i believe the service could be better if they hired more staff.  I enjoy the Hangover as well as the pork miso. It can be pricey. But honestly most good ramen is around that price. I do think it's a rip off to charge someone 2.40 for soda though.   I do like that they have an awards card and at the end after you buy five ramen bowls, you get a free ramen bowl."}
{"text":"This was absolutely awful which is such a heartbreak because I truly believe Johnathan Sawyer is such a genius.   I had al-dente ramen for fifteen dollars. And when I say ramen, I mean four bites and a poached egg. It's overwhelmingly overpriced, and I understand that westlake is a wealthy neighborhood, but a lot of us are high school students wanting to go somewhere easy that's not Cheesecake Factory or another expensive chain.   The space is so small and it truly hinders the entire experience if you're standing up with your good looking around for a place to sit. It makes the diners uncomfortable and the people who have to wait to eat their food.   I loved the old noodlecat. This is just a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Oddly really slow service and I wish I could just create my own noodle bowl. The facility was also dirty - spilled sauces everywhere, automatic utensil dispenser didn't work, a LOT of negatives."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth a try if you're looking for a decent meal near Public Square.  As a downtowner I've eaten here four or five times and have never left disappointed. I dunno if it's really worth 5 stars over 4, but I feel so bad about all this negativity so I figured I'd bump it up a notch.  Firstly, I can't believe that people call the portions small. I'm a decent eater and I generally can barely finish a steam bun and a bowl.   Secondly, I've had (or at least tried with a friend) most of the stuff on the menu at Noodlecat. Don't walk in expecting true authenticity from a place that serves a dish called \"Roscoe's Fried Chicken and Ramen.\" It's just not gonna happen. What you should expect is awesome service and good \"fusion\" dishes that are maybe a little expensive for a lunch but not overpriced on the whole. The flavors are strong, but the noodles are mild and almost all the bowls come with some sort of veggies in them to help offset the saltiness of the rest of the dish. You can also have them crack an egg in it or get some avocado to even it out if you're so inclined.  Thirdly, if you're gonna make a fuss about the chef (who has taken the time to come to your table and talk to you) being in jeans and a bandanna, you may as well cross off two thirds of the decent restaurants in the city.  Fourthly, Fever tree Ginger beer might be the greatest beverage in the western hemisphere.  Anyway, Noodlecat is an awesome restaurant. Order the specials, they're always amazing."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Noodle Cat.... And it won't be our last.   The food, great!  The service, fantastic!  The drinks and beer menu, sublime!  The atmosphere, inviting!  The Vibe, cool & hip!  Authentic ? Who cares ?????  Seriously..... When everything else works why quibble."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  For appetizers I recommend the Crispy Fried Brussel Sprouts (you'll be surprised how good this really is!)  and Tempura Onion Steam Bun.  For noodle dishes I always order the half size Crispy Beef Short-Rib Ramen. Perfect sized dish and great if you are looking for something with lots of flavor and not saturated with salt.  I am a repeat customer and am pleased each time!"}
{"text":"Another subpar experience at a Johnathon Sawyer establishment. You're better off eating ramen at home instead of spending over $15 on flavorless water and noodles.   The Sawyers name used to be impressive but recently all their establishments have experienced a tremendous decline. I hope the Sawyers will eventually come to their senses and start running their businesses instead of focusing on their image ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Expensive and small portions. The flavor is bland and the Brussels sprouts/broccoli was so under flavored. My husband and I used to frequent the downtown location, we won't be back to the Westlake location. It makes us sad as we used to love it there."}
{"text":"Went this week with some friends and had a great time! Delicious food, good service, and the price wasn't too bad! Definitely gonna go back!"}
{"text":"I was totally excited to try this place, and it was, unfortunately, a total let down.   The food: i had a special spicy pork cutlet ramen- good enough, but really not amazing. the wings were dry and tiny- really sad little guys. the heritage pork buns were good, but not good enough to redeem the problems with service and atmosphere.   the service: we could see our server's belly. it was not an appetizing belly. He had barely any idea what he was talking about, saying \"sorta\" and \"kinda\" too much. kept leaving the table after refilling waters without taking our order. but the belly part... i hope you guys are paying your staff enough to buy shirts that actually button over their guts. ugh.  the worst part: the atmosphere. Look, I've been to a bunch of little no-frills ramen places. I get the vibe- whoever decorated noodlecat did not. it felt like a kid's cafeteria, not the dark, elbow-to-elbow slurping hall typical of ramen shops. the shop stools are really uncomfortable to try to sit on throughout a meal. everything in the restaurant made us feel uncomfortable and hurried. also, the wall color is awful.  you guys fucked up somewhere along the line (and I'm really sorry to have to say it!)"}
{"text":"Annoyed. Line as ridiculous then as soon we got close to the front they announced they were sold out!!! It was 2:30pm!!! They open at 11! This is absurd and very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"I went to the West Side Market one. The signs were modern and hip, so I thought this place would be a tasty food-truck type of establishment. I was put off that none of the employees were Asian for an Asian restaurant, but I set aside my bias and hoped that the food would be yummy.   I had the miso broth noodles.  They were completely bland and tasteless. It does not have the sweet Asian flavor. (Yup, I'm Asian, so I've had tons of noodle dishes) They put soy sauce in the condiments section. I didn't know if I was supposed to flavor it myself?  :O  I was sadly disappointed. I thought it would be a good place from the decor. Oh well. I've had amazing ramen in SF and NYC. Cleveland still is missing its ramen niche..."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Noodlecat it was to-go. It was good but left me wanting more. Since then I've been to Noodlecat twice in the last two weeks. You can say I'm obsessed. I love the lighting and how the bar is in the back. The tables are cool and some look communal. It's a nice look and feel. The staff is very welcoming and the service is always good.   Food: I've started with the Pancake- type appetizer and LOVE it!!! There are a fun flavors and textures that make the dish very enjoyable. It's sweet, savory, crunchy, a little spicy, and pancake/homefry like. It's really really delicious.  Between my boyfriend and I, we've tried pretty much all the noodle dishes. My favorite is the college ramen followed by the spicy octopus udon. The former is not spicy, a higher class version of the Ramen you buy at CVS. The spicy octopus is SPICY. So if you don't like hot, I would not recommend it. The steam buns are not my favorite but my boyfriend really enjoys them, his favorite is the brisket.   Drink:  The sparkling saki on draft is awesome. (If you can't tell, I venture here for the amazing happy hour - it's worth it). They also have Fat Tire on draft."}
{"text":"For so long I was so hesitant to try this place and now I want to eat here everyday. I am in love with this place now. I want it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   You MUST try a steam bun. The pulled pork one is to die for.   You also MUST try a noodle bowl. The Dan Dan is delicious.   Now that you've read this review, go (RUN) to Noodlecat and try it!"}
{"text":"Items Tasted: Housemade Ramen Pork Miso - Roasted Pork, Crispy Garlic, Sesame, Scallion, 6-Minute Egg Ohio Udon Crispy Beef Short Rib - Pork Dashi Broth, Kimchi, Sweet and Sour Bone-In Ohio Short Rib Fresh Bacon Bun - Sugar Cured, Lightly Smoked and Roasted Ohio Pork Belly with BBQ J-Fried Chicken Bun - Naturally Raised Amish Chicken, Sweet and Spicy Power Ketchup Ohio Beef Burger Bun - Ketchup and Miso Tempura Lake Fish Bun - Fresh Lake Erie Fish, Lettuce and Miso Sauce  More than a little impressed by Trentina, an average visit to Greenhouse Tavern too far in the past to cause any concern about Jonathon Sawyer's other recent ventures, it was admittedly with skepticism about Ramen in general that I sat down at noodlecat prior to the Cavs World Championship banner raising ceremonies, the trendy spot on Euclid Avenue jammed-packed with World Series Game 1 also going on that evening, which may partially explain service that was an unmitigated disaster.  A long and narrow space across from The Arcade and not too far from 4th Street, entry to noodlecat sees diners first in a foyer with Magazines and to-go sheets before passing a second set of doors to the hostess podium where ordering sheets and pencils await, a few tiny two-tops still unoccupied, though thoroughly uncomfortable with metal stools.  Left without water, service or even a semblance of acknowledgement for nearly ten minutes, a man who seemed to be a busser eventually flagged down and handed the check-boxed order, it was beneath the dull roar of a full house and restaurant-standard Rock Music that another lengthy wait passed before a jug of Water arrived, all three plates fast to follow and immediately making the table overcrowded.  Happy to see that Sawyer had taken it upon himself to challenge my primary complaint with Ramem, the typical package noodles offered but only beneath housemade Ramen and Udon on the menu, it was in two large bowls that my appetite was invested, the bowls no more expensive than those offered in many U.S. Chinatowns despite the Chef's Beard Award winning credentials and his well-known fondness for locally-sourced, organic ingredients.  Tasting a few Bao while the steaming soups cooled, the pillowy Steam Buns par for the course with a quartet of toppings, the Beef Burger unfortunately came across as an overcooked slider topped in non-traditional condiments including Miso, the Pork Belly and Fried Chicken both far more tasty while the fried local Fish was a flashback to days on Lake Erie with my grandparents during childhood.  Moving on to the main event(s,) medium-springy Housemade Ramen ordered in creamy Pork Miso topped in fried Garlic and Scallions with Sesame and a sous-vide egg alongside thick Udon with bone-in Short Ribs slowly dissolving in Dashi modestly spiced by Kimchi, those skeptical of a Midwesterner making Asian Noodles will be happy to know that although non-traditional both bowls were complex and boldly flavored with a clean finish, a lot of soup left over at the end of the meal when it would have almost been easier to walk out without paying than to flag down a server for a bill."}
{"text":"The quality of food at Noodlecat is above average.  I stopped in with a co-worker recently and we ordered some noodle dishes.  My buddy got the Pork Nama Ramen, which he really enjoyed.  He let me taste the pork and it was delicious, even though I don't like bones in my bowl.  I ordered the Fiery Dan Dan with Ohio Udon noodles.  It didn't have any brother, which was disappointing, but the flavor was excellent.  It was just a little spicy and it had some peanuts in it.  I loved the dish, but I wish it was served with some broth.  I'll be back to sample the menu."}
{"text":"I am a huge aficionado and lover of all Japanese culture - whether it's the food, film, music, or literature.  Which is why I love Noodlecat so much - such an awesome western take on Japanese food and culture - so I can't believe I just found out about this joint.  My fiancee and I went in for their happy hour which has some awesome deals on tap Sake, half price bowls, and 2 for $5 steam buns.  From right when i walked in and the wall had a giant picture of Totorro exclaiming that he recommends the steam buns, I knew I was hooked; and, my gods, were the steam buns totes amaze balls on fleek, as the kids these days would say.  They're small little Japanese steamed bun 'sandwiches' with American twists of pulled pork, fried chicken, etc. Seriously, they're so good, you will soon be craving them after your first visit.  I'd say the steam buns are my favorite, but honestly, like a father of twin nobel laureates - I love them and the ramen equally.   In college, i once went two weeks eating nothing but ramen noodles when my meal plan expired before finals.  But this is not your college 10 for $1 ramen.   My favorite is their pork miso ramen, which is fantastically flavorful and delicious.  As this was happy hour, their bowls were half price and half size, but even so, it was huge and filling.  Noodlecat also has Sake on tap. SOLD. FOREVER heart Noodlecat.  PS, follow them on Instagram - they post daily specials of new and amazing sounding creations for the day."}
{"text":"Just another Americanized disgrace in Cleveland.  First time I went I got the California bowl with tofu and rice. Overall the flavor was average, tofu was alright, but the rice was god awful. It was still dripping wet and soggy, like they barely finished cooking it. This dish called for tacky rice but I basically received a rice soup bowl. I tried this place again a few weeks later, hoping their ramen would be near authentic to Japanese ramen. Negatory. The broth was too over flavored and dark, like it was trying too hard. The udon noodles made it feel like I was fighting an octopus with my chop sticks. Just an overall boring experience affirming Cleveland dumbs most cultural restaurants down"}
{"text":"After a lot of debate, my family and I decided to eat lunch at Noodlecat. The location is great next to Yard house at Crocker Park. The food was a big disappointment. It was not healthy and the chicken was not properly deep fried. If you take the bun, it's very chewey and had only a bite size piece of meat.   Total disappointment. They could have done wonders with the Noodle concept but the menu was limited and the food was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Okay, so I returned to Noodlecat roughly two months ago & can now take my 5 star review down to a 1 1/2 :( They not only got rid of the only noodle bowl I enjoyed but my server this time was kinda... unavailable and not ...idk, zoned out a little?? I tried their College Chicken & it was horrible! Very bland, the broth tasted like it had been over cooked or maybe from a can. The chicken was tough and there was no seasoning . Guess I can cross this one off my list :("}
{"text":"I had the hangover bowl and it was so flavorful and filling. Kimchi was spicy good adding a great balance, my 1st time having it will not be the last. Friendly staff great atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're eating noodles, you're not just ordering for the noodles itself but for the flavor of the broth and the toppings. I ordered the fried chicken ramen and the broth was very bland. Even though the fried chicken was tasty, it could not compensate for the lack of toppings. If you are looking for authentic Japanese ramen, do not come to this place expecting anything.   The happy hour deal (2 steam buns for $5) was a delight and would come back for the buns but only for that reason."}
{"text":"Do I give Noodlecat one star or two? Hmm. I'll give it two.  I agree with my other fellow yelpers- this place is pretty bad. I mean, if you've never experienced good ramen, of course you wouldn't know any better, but if you have had actually good quality ramen from major cities...this place is bad.   I feel that the staple of ramen places is the quality of the noodle. Homemade spun noodles. Where you can order them by their texture- medium, hard, soft, medium-hard, and so on. And the broth is a major staple as well (check out my Daikokuya or Shinsegumi reviews from LA).  So, although I was wary to even try this place (I was aftraid to be rather disappointed and sad after trying it), I was peer pressured into it, by friends who were attending their \"Back to School\" special. Cheap specials- $5 \"college ramen\" bowls, 25 to 75 cents small samplings of sangria and summer ales. And man, they had quite the extensive list of alcohol- kinda strange for an Asian noodle place.    Off I went after a long Saturday. Noodlecat looks nice, don't get me wrong-the interior is great, and man, is that great location on Euclid. It just looks cool and modern. I sat down at the bar and proceeded to try the appetizers as they were getting passed around before we ordered. I remember the rice ball....falling apart and having no taste. Just hand me the bottle of rice seasoning please.  My friends all ordered the college ramen....and all hated it. The general comment? \"It tastes just like the name....instant ramen from college.\" Bleh. I tried the pork miso ramen. Where was my pork? And why was the broth not good... and the noodles tasted like the packed instant noodles I buy from Asian grocery stores. Really? I just spent money on that? My friend got another specialty ramen as well...but general consensus from all of us (all asian too) were definitely a \"bleh.\"  I mean, this place would probably be a cool place to get a drink and relax....if you don't care about getting quality ramen. It's a cool location. But if you want good ramen....try somewhere else. The service was good, don't get me wrong- just..... I was indeed disappointed and sad."}
{"text":"While I am an avid browser of Yelp, I have never been spurred to write any reviews until today's visit to Noodlecat. Recapping my first time to Noodlecat:  1) Noodlecat received a lot of hype from colleagues before it opened, being one of Cleveland's first noodle joints. However, my intrigue in this restaurant died a bit after reading Yelp reviews and hearing that after said colleague went to this place, was sorely disappointed.  2) Despite this, I was still willing to give it a try, and finally found some time to go today, after waiting many many months. Parking was fine at 2pm... found close parking across the street: win!  3) Got to the restaurant, hostess seemed kind of cold, and intially was not willing to let us sit in the 6-people table (which I guess is not unreasonable as there was only 2 of us)... but the restaurant was completely empty. At most other places I have been to, if the restaurant is empty, seating is open to whever we want to sit. Fortunately, she changed her mind shortly after, and we got the table closest to the window, and had better lighting than the 4-people table right next to it (where she originally wanted to place us). I would have been fine with that table, since the tables are very roomy and comfortable, but the lighting in the restaurant is way way way too dim. For a noodle joint especially, I would prefer and expect lighter, brighter. Would have sat outside, but was afraid it might get too hot after eating hot noodles. And then the music was obnoxious angry rock, really did not contribute to a noodle joint vibe (I don't care if it's supposed to be new age fusion, whatever. The dim lighting and loud angry rock music already made the restaurant lose some appeal).   4) Menu seemed simple. I ordered the Takahachi Ramen, and BF ordered the Pork Miso Ramen. Plus here is that the manager allowed us to order the lunch special, even though at that time, it was already 2:15-ish. I got a Super Salad with my noodle dish. BF added an egg to his.. asked the waitress if the egg would be partly cooked and partly running; she quickly responded yes, as if she wasn't even listening, and bolted away.   5) Now onto the food... The salad was actually pretty good; this would be my favorite part of the meal. It was light and refreshing, and I really enjoyed the avocado that they added.  My bowl of Takahachi Ramen... it was good initially; was pleasantly surprised by the kelp that was in it - although a little salty. I also actually enjoyed the wheat noodles, although BF did not like this at all. What I did not enjoy... broth was not flavored, but was also pretty oily. Also, the whole dish was lukewarm. Ramen should be HOT not lukewarm. Scallions were large and raw, and would have benefited from being cooked a bit - which I think they would have been adequately cooked if the soup had been hot enough. The pork that was included in the soup... was perhaps only a small spoon worth of pork, and in a chunk in the noodle. I ate this in a mouthful, and was hit by an unpleasant alcoholy taste? Usually I finish all of my food despite being stuffed, but once I reached slightly fullness, I just had to stop.  BF's Pork Miso Ramen... what he had to say was \"midway, I wanted to puke.\" I tried his soup... it tasted like the instant miso soup packets you can buy at the Asian store for like.. $4 for a pack of 12. The egg that he ordered with his noodle, was completely raw; you could see the white of the egg surrounding the yolk, and was not cooked at all. He had been so excited by the egg too, but looked scared as he put the egg into his spoon, closed his eyes and gulped it down. Disgusting. It was definitely not cooked. Perhaps it was meant to cook in the soup, had the soup been hot like it should have been.  We ate... and then bolted as soon as we paid the check. The most embarrassing part is that this was BF's birthday today, and I am embarrassed to have taken him to this joint for his special day.   Edit: Forgot to mention that the pricing was horrendous. $27 after tip. We could have eaten 2 delicious large bowls of pho and yummy bubble tea at Superior Pho."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time eating at Noodlecat (we've ordered to our offices) and I was extremely pleased as always. The ramen is delicious and you get a ton. I recommend the short rib ramen. The ribs are extremely meaty with barely any fat! My husband got the college style chicken and wished he had got mine or ordered double meat. However he loved both the broth and noodles.   I was fairly impressed with the service. For being 8pm on a Saturday, the place was pretty busy but we were served quickly. However, both my husband and I ordered steam buns but we only got one. It wasn't a huge deal as we didn't get charged for it. My husband also asked them to add fire to his ramen and mine was definitely spicier. All in all, we were both very happy and last night being Cleveland's first snow of the year, the ramen was PERFECT!"}
{"text":"The concept and idea behind this place is fantastic, but unfortunately the food is just MEHH. Worse than a plain package of just ramen noodles..really. I've been here twice and each time my meal was lackluster and just not worth any hype. Everything on the menu seems to sound good in essence, but is executed poorly when it comes to a dish having any flavor. I really wanted to fall in love with Noddlecat because I'm totally digging the hipster vibe..."}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment to Ramen. I have been wanting to try noodlecat because I love Ramen and I've had real authentic ramen while traveling. I had the pork miso and the college ramen- both were God awful. The pork ramen has pulled pork in it???? What? Thats not true to Japanese food at all. Don't pay $10 for this ramen- there's places in Cleveland with real authentic ramen for the same price."}
{"text":"Considering that this restaurant is in the midwest, I'll give it a four. It it was in the westcoast, my expectations will be higher, then it'll be one star down.  anyways, overall, I was quite satisfied with the pork miso ramen that I ordered. Although it didn't taste the same as traditional japanese pork ramen, it was close enough. The presentation of pork was also different - it was almost like pulled pork, whereas traditionally, pork is sliced and placed on top of the noodles flat. The boiled egg in the soup was cold - they need to warm it up better. Otherwise, it was a large portion. I would suggest adding seaweed to the soup as well. My bf ordered the crispy short rib ramen - the short rib was very very well done, but the broth of the ramen tasted a little strange to me. We also tried their steamed buns - we got the chicken and brisket. They were pretty good. I do recommend them.  Overall, an above than average experience for me and I will probably come here again if I'm craving for some ramen. The service was not the greatest - the waiters/waitresses seemed very uninterested and aloof. The price was also on the pricey side compared to other Japanese ramen places."}
{"text":"New restaurant still in process. Chef Johnathon Sawyers creation he started with greenhouse tavern on e 4 downtown cleveland. They had a Noodlecat restaurant Ryan but it is closed I am quite sure. Staff obviously is new I was appreciative of the staff's accommodating me. I ordered udon noodles and octopus. Extra noodles 17.00 total. Noodles extra 4.00. I was disappointed with a double noodle order that I did not get more noodles. Also; my order took a half hour no lie.I chilled and just came to the conclusion that I am not on anybody's schedule but mine so relax and breathe. One man pretty much did cooking he trained a young girl who was on second day she was the cashier. The restaurant had some construction going on after 11 am. I don't know what time they open but it seemed that they were open yet the close sign was out so on my walkback through everything was right I guess the dish was too much sauce for me. It created some stomach issues for me. Octopus isn't cheap so I didn't really care about price.Octopus if not cooked perfectly is chewy.This octopus was cooked right. I could compare fish to zen cuisine that was in the arcade arcade their udon noodles would be about tops 8 dollars tops. They are in process of reopening after a fire they had fingers crossed that this is true about Zen cuisine."}
{"text":"This place has let me down for the past three time I have went there and here is why. When Noodlcat first opened, it was amazing and could easily be compared to any other bomb ramen joint. That is why when I have been back there for the past two years, it has been nothing but disappointments. From the service, to the food, to the smell of the place itself I have had enough and will not be going back there again. I have always order either the pork miso ramen or the dan dan ramen and have also ordered the steam buns. Last time I was there I ordered the same fried chicken buns that I always do and I don't know if it was because they were marked down due to happy hour but the chicken was soggy and it made the bun soggy as well. After that, my ramen came out and I always get their ghost pepper sauce along with my ramen because I like it spicy. I asked the waitress before I ordered it and she did not bring it out and then when I asked again she told me (in a rude way) that she has no idea what I am talking about and they have never had anything like that there. What made my ramen more disappointing is the fact that my 6 minute egg was overcooked and there was a tiny amount of pork in mine still leaving me very hungry. I don't know if they are serving smaller portions during happy hour but I just have been unimpressed every time in the past two years and this is coming from a girl that used to love this place. Super bummed, and I hope that they step up their game again."}
{"text":"I was an out of towner from Chicago traveling for work and stumbled upon this place after a very long day. Super affordable, the waiter was extremely friendly and attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Gave me extra avocado for my salad with no charge... Which doesn't happen often. Overall, was very surprised and pleased with the menu that offered healthy and gluten free clean options.   Got the super salad.. Super good. Friend got the pork ramen and she loved it.  Two thumbs up for a quaint Cleveland find ( music and atmosphere was good too)."}
{"text":"I was stoked about the arrival of Noodlecat after the much anticipated opening, however never made it.  It was a few months later, and everyone on Yelp! had nothing but bad things to say about it.    I headed down on a weekday around noon for lunch, which I was scared about it being packed.  Well, we were the first table to sit in their front dining area.  It was a bit awkward, but then it started filling in a little bit.  Nothing like I would have expected for a location downtown and a fairly new eatery with a very reputable Chef.  I feel that after Greenhouse opened and with all of the praise Jon Sawyer got for that, a lot was expected of him here; rightfully so.  However, this seems to me like his quirky side gig where he just wanted to add something new to our city, but with his spin on it.  He didn't want it to be authentically Japanese or just like your favorite NYC Noodlehouse.    We shared two different, and equally amazing buns as our app.  In fact, they were out of the one we ordered so they threw a different one at us complimentarily.   We ended up with the BBQ Ohio Pork w/ pickled onions & scallions and the Japanese Fried Chicken. They each had unique combinations of flavors and awesome sauces, and I would definitely recommend the BBQ Pork.    For our meals, we split the ramen of the day (A breakfast Ramen of some sort, which I cannot remember the ingredients exactly, but consisted of  aside from having a beef broth, beef sausage, potatoes and a fried egg on top) and the Takahashi Ramen.  Both were very interesting.  We both agreed that we like the components (esp. sausage) of the Breakfast ramen, but preferred the Takahashi Ramen garlic pork broth.  I wish I could have done a sampler of 5 small bowls of Ramen.  That would be ideal for me in this type of crazy ramen joint.    We didn't have room for the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun, but hell yea, I'll go back and get it.    You should try it, too."}
{"text":"I was excited to try something new- Unfortunately this one was not a winner in my book. A beer that came in a pretty cool can and tasted just like a spoiled Rolling Rock cost 9.99. I did some what enjoy the barbecue pork steamed bun but it was so messy that you kind of had to devour the whole thing within 30 seconds. It was  also a lot smaller than I had anticipated. I also had the fried chicken Ramen. I don't think they actually fried the chicken. It was soggy (even though the broth had not yet been added because I ordered my food to go) and the chickens breading was somewhat of a crumb type. Not something you expect to come out of the fryer. The noodles and (lack of) veggies in the Ramen bowl were probably prepared earlier that day because they had solidified into a block. Also I'm pretty sure they use the same noodles that come with top Ramen.   If I happen to be walking around Crocker Park I may stop in Noodlecat only for a bubble tea. The little beads of tapioca was quite enjoyable. Otherwise I will eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! And while the ramen wasn't the best I've had, it was a nice attempt and definitely satiated the lunchtime cravings.   To start, my Japanese Chopped Salad came with iceberg, bok choy, tofu ranch, soy  braised egg, bacon, avocado, smoked tofu & crispy ramen. It was phenomenal, particularly the soy eggs!  As a bit of a letdown, my order of the fried chicken ramen initially gave me high hopes with its description alone. \"Ramen with fried chicken, butter, hot sauce, maple syrup, greens & fried chicken broth\" ended up being a fried drumstick on a plate alongside what tasted like canned chicken noodle soup. It wasn't bad by ANY means but just not what I expected based on the menu listing.  We never received our order of steamed buns and I finally got my cocktail well after finishing my salad (combo came with ramen and salad) and as I was midway through my meal.   When I finally got my basil gimlet, it was a simple, refreshing libation with muddled basil, Hendricks and lime. Can't mess that up!"}
{"text":"I have been to Noodlecat three times - each time the food was excellent. The appetizer that is a mixture of pickled vegetables is great - each time i tried it it was different. It is a good item to share. I have tried the pork miso, bbq ribs, and fried chicken bowls - my favorite was the pork miso - a lot of flavor and loved the soft boiled egg. The fried chicken wing on the side was excellent but the noodle bowl it went with was okay. Also have tried the steam buns - liked what was in them but didn't care for the texture of the actual bun. The only reason i am not giving 5 stars is the service - room for improvement. I would definitely recommend trying."}
{"text":"If this was less expensive and I'd never tried the downtown Noodle Cat, I could give more stars.  Just very disappointing quality, selection and quantity- and not cheap."}
{"text":"I've tried Japanese ramen in four other big cities (LA, NY, DC, Chicago) so my tastes are quite spoiled when it comes to Japanese ramen. I tried their pork miso ramen and it was just ok. The broth was really salty and tasted fatty. It did have a good richness to it. Just not authentic. The noodles were good. The pork was too mushy. I found 3 small pieces of bone when I bit into the pork. Luckily my waiter was nice enough to take it off my check. I tried their japanese fried chicken bun which was not all that great. The fried chicken was really small and the sauce just didn't do it. I had to add extra hot sauce to it. My boyfriend tried the pulled pork bun and it was alright. It had too much BBQ sauce on it. Also we found a big piece of bone in it. He tried the crispy beef short rib ramen and he did not like it. The broth lacked a lot of flavor. The short ribs were alright. It seems like they tried to mimic korean short ribs. The flavor was good but the meat was sliced so thin. I would go again but only because sometimes I just need my japanese ramen fix. For now noodle cat will do."}
{"text":"This was such a letdown after eating at their now closed Euclid Avenue location. Nothing was fresh and the service and atmosphere are completely ruined since relocating to Crocker Park.  I had been looking forward to their fresh steam buns all week, but they were a sad (frozen) shell of what they were downtown. One bright spot was the broccoli and brussel sprouts, they were delicious. Despite that small glimmer of tastiness, we shall never return."}
{"text":"The price is pretty good for lunch compared to other places on that street. But the noodle, they really need to work on it. I have been there twice tried three different kinda if noodles and they taste all kinda weird"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 3.5, because a 3 seems low but a 4 seems like pushing it a little. Wandered in here on Sunday evening after a cold day at the Browns game, and needing a switch from fried/bar food. Cool little spot. We had the pulled pork steam bun, and a pickle steam bun to share as an appetizer - I preferred the pickle, my boyfriend enjoyed the pork. I ordered the Dan Dan Ramen - it was really good but a little more spicy than what I was expecting took me a few minutes to get used to it. My boyfriend had the clam chowder dish and said it was slightly spicy which he enjoyed - he also LOVED the thick noodles that came in his dish. Our waitress was okay, it took her a really long time to notice our water glasses needed to be refilled even though there were not very many other diners in the restaurant when we were there. Overall a good spot and I would likely return when we are back in CLE."}
{"text":"The ramen was good. The service was decent but the prices are insanely high for what you get. Probably not a place I'd recommend you go if you don't want to spend a fortune."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place to eat lunch downtown, and I eat here at least once a week. Tried the Dan Dan Ramen for the first time today, along with my standby Super Salad, and now I don't see how I can not come back every single day for that dish for the rest of time. It is soooooo delicious!  I noticed that many of the negative reviews were from 2011-2012, as was my original 3-star review. I'm shocked at how much this place has improved! I hope others will give it a second chance as well."}
{"text":"The thing to order here are the buns. They were very good. However, the noodle dishes, even at happy hour half price were not even so-so. The Udon Tofu was like soup instead of a noodle bowl. The pancake app was way undercooked. The wine was down right undrinkable and should be taken off the menu. Service was efficient although a little odd. Always wanted to come here as I love noodle places in NYC and was excited when I saw this place move in downtown. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Money would have been better spent spending 99 cents on a block of Ramen from Giant Eagle or Marcs. Totally flavorless, no fresh vegtables. The most basic Ramen there is the closest you will get to vegetables which consists of  frozen peas and corn. No onion, carrots or spice of any kind to add some flavor. The best part was the extra egg I added. Place was clean and staff was very nice but no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Went here on my Cleveland business trip. I met up with 2 other friends here, one of which gave me this recommendation. I'm lovin' the name and simplistic decor of the place.   Not tonkotsu level ramen, but still better than your average noodle bowl. The dishes and flavors look a little different now than when I was here but overall, the prices are competitive and the taste was great. I remember ordering 2 tofu appetizers and a meyer lemon fancy soda.   Location can be tricky when you're driving but it was walking distance from my Marriott downtown hotel."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I really can't see myself going a second time. I had the Tsukemen Ramen and while the actual noodle was good, I can't get past the rest of it. The soup base was too \"fatty\" and didn't have that nice balance of being flavorful, but still light. And what's up with the pork belly? I went to Dante for their noodle night and pork belly was in the ramen, too. Is it some type of \"Americanized\" attempt at the less fatty type of CharShu that's usually in ramen? I don't get it and I really wish they would give you a less fatty choice of meat.  Also, the PRICE! Ramen shops in bigger cities like New York and Toronto have lower prices and don't make you pay extra on standard items, like the egg.  I just want to add that we went for lunch on opening day and were treated to the takoyaki. It was a pretty interesting take on it with the bone marrow, but like some of the reviewers said before, there were not enough octopus pieces in it. Also, service was fast and pretty good. I just really wish the food was better/more authentic."}
{"text":"My late trip into CLE put me downtown into my hotel and very hungry. So I got into my room and looked at what was close. Noodlecat popped up and I was within a short walk.   Was I glad I did the short walk because this place is \"THE CATS MEOW!\" for noodles. First off it's not a big place kinda like a shotgun house in NOLA. But it's very cool and inviting. I sat in the back bar area where there is a TV (if that's important to you). Service was quick and they explained the menu. The hotel said get the Ohio CAB Burger (a steamed bun) slider type of heavenly softness with a great burger and roasted onions that was sublimely genius.  I ordered the \"Pork Miso Ramen\". OMG to the MAX!  The noodles were cooked to perfection the pork was well done and the broth was sublime. So I was told their buns were great and the mention above was a tribute to that. But I had to try the Chocolate Bun. Chocolate Bun you say?  Yes and it was Great, no it was great to the 10th power times a billion. Who knew banana, Nutella, and a soft pillow of a bun would be this good?  Well I know now and you gotta try! Their selections are great and they do have Vegetarian options and the noodle bowls can be customized as well. If your in Cleveland and downtown you must stop by Noodlecat."}
{"text":"Ya, No. Maybe, just maybe if you work in the hood and want a bowl of noodles. Otherwise, try a place that's cleaner, and with a better trained waitstaff. Noodles were just ok. Buns were good. Experience was meh. That's why 2 stars. (btw - I have lived in NYC, LA, and traveled the world so I have high expectations)."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account, solely to express my disappointment with this place. When it came to Cleveland's Noodlecat, it was FANTASTIC. Amazing food, portions, and prices; an, easy 5-stars. Now? I'd rather pay $10 for instant ramen.   Ramen  was terrible.  You could literally get more flavor out of a Nissan flavor packet. I got the Miso Ramen, and they gave me what looked like a tablespoon of pork. In cleveland, they gave you a giant bowl that you could hardly finish. Now, I went to Popeye's after leaving the place, because I was still hungry.   Steam Bun sizes were lacking and expensive. In Cleveland, they had steam buns which had a huge chunk of meat inside. They were easily worth the 4 for $10. But now? $5 for a single steam bun, that was half the size of the original? You'd be doing yourself a better favor, donating the money to a scam email.  Prices were overpriced.  I should have listened to the advice of the people who walked out before I walked in. When they said the phrase \"I waited months for this place to open up, and I wish I never waited.\" I should have taken them seriously. What was originally an $11 bowl of ramen, became 14. I wanted BADLY to ask for a refund, but because I took my medication before receiving my food (I'm a diabetic, I take insulin; and, when you take insulin, you need some sort of food intake,) it stopped me from returning it after the first bite.    Overall: one huge disappointment.  They better fix their menu, and their prices; before, they close for now.  As for me, I'm going to Yuzu in Lakewood for my ramen. It's better, has larger portions, and half the price."}
{"text":"Very bland and flavorless broth with dried corn and peas trying to be an upscale version of instant ramen. It's not. I have no idea how the talented chef behind this restaurant thought this tasted good enough to sell to people. There aren't many menu options besides ramen and steam buns, and there are places in Cleveland that do both of these far better."}
{"text":"The people that work there are really nice!!! However, the food is blah. There's nothing special about it."}
{"text":"This has become one of my regular stops at the West Side Market. The little steam buns are a delicious snack for on the go eating. They always have an interesting daily special on rotation. I usually get the pork. The soup is also a pretty good deal. The pork miso ramen is my usual choice. The soup is a little more difficult to eat while standing in the bustling shopping area so it is ideal to get a seat in the balcony area and enjoy the majesty of the building. The super salad is a must try. It is my favorite salad to eat at any restaurant and can be had for the nice price of $5. It is kale, avocado, orange slices, adzuki beans, blueberry, granola and quinoa. Not only is it packed with \"super foods\", it is tasty! You don't have to wait around for happy hour at Noodlecat, because this is happy hour pricing whenever the market is open. I encourage you to check it out."}
{"text":"I don't think soup should be so expensive. I thought the soup was good. I wish I would have brought some water to dilute it a little bit. Then I would have had leftovers and my blood pressure would not have spiked. The little buns of stuff were really good. I adore the cat on the logo. I almost broke down in tears when I saw someone spray paint tagged the little waving kitty in front of the now closed hibachi place in Lakewood. I can't believe people get tattoos of that dumb Melt logo and don't get this cat put on their skin. I guess there are a lot of things in life that I will never understand."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Noodlecat. The decor and service were good. But the food has a long way to go before I could recommend this place. As a vegan, I could not eat the majority of their menu items. I finally decided on Ohio Udon Noodles with vegetable broth (not on menu) and vegetables. When the dish arrived, it came in a cat-face shaped bowl with a small ladle, which was very challenging to eat wide noodles with. The broth had zero flavor. I may have been better off buying ramen at Walmart and micro-waving it myself. Definitely not worth the price. Sorry guys, I won't be back. Ramen shouldn't be this hard to like. How about adding vegetable broth with some flavor beside sweet or hot?"}
{"text":"It's a Rule of thumb, When you serve ramen, it must be piping hot. so in terms of of this, cat noodle failed. My noodles were cold and clumpy and lacked of taste.   Service was slow and not senior citizen friendly. We went here with my father in law, we were finally seated after we waited about 20 min... after I decided to go look for the waiter/host to seat us ( no host at the host stations at the time) She seated us near the door but I asked her if we can be seated not near the door, because is to cramped for 3 of us and I did see other table that available but instead of accommodating us right away, she said no twice but I insisted I want the other table because it is more comfortable for my father in law.  Finally she granted my wish but really?!? twice say no even though she saw an old man with the Cane & oxygen  standing beside me ..for God sake ...!!"}
{"text":"Noodlecat is a trendy Japanese-esque place I've been frequenting for quite some time. I wish wish wish this place could be 5 stars in my mind, but it just never makes the grade. Their ramen is mediocre; the real prize is in all of the buns and appetizers.  I was a bit disappointed upon my last visit to find that they do not offer half-bowls of ramen at dinner time. Being a 120-lb woman, I can't fill my belly with an entire gallon of soup..it just won't end well. I understand that sometimes that's just the way things are, but out server could have informed us that half-bowls were available at the bar area for happy hour (especially since I made a stink about not being able to order the half like I always do). I was pretty pissed off to hear someone at the bar less than 5 feet away from my table order a half bowl."}
{"text":"I visited a while ago, and couldn't put my finger on why I felt disappointed.  I'm a big lover of noodles, broths, etc.  I think it comes down to 3 small misses that add up to create a cumulative effect I just can't overcome in my head.  First off, the place is stylized similar to a Chipotle.  It's on the cold, modern, eclectic side.  I like that vibe at Chippy when I've got two hands wrapped around a burrito the size of a small baby and there's carnitas juice dripping its way towards my elbows.  In a Japanese restaurant at a slightly higher price point, it simply didn't have the comfort factor in the décor, to match the comfort of the food.  Secondly, the noodle dishes were too far on the sour/salty side of the scale.  I realize that is personal preference, but hey, it's my mouth so I will call it as I taste it.  Only going to take one star off for that mind you.  Finally, the quality of the meat.  I had a pork ramen and the meat was stringy, with a lot of fatty, connective tissue.  This plays back into the price thing.  I can deal with poor meat at the Chinese buffet, but at this price point, I expect quality meat.  I realize that lean doesn't always equal quality, but, connective tissues are always gross in a brothy bowl.  Just thinking of the 'pork' they used makes my stomach clench.  Won't give it another shot."}
{"text":"Sad. Used to love this place. It was convenient, quick, tasty, and had the most important part gluten free noodles.  Went the other week to find the new menu concept. First of all we waited 5 min before someone told us to seat ourselves...okay then. Then we notice the new menu without gluten free noodles. Tracked down a waitress to ask and she simply said \"well we have rice now, and that's gluten free\". Why would I want a noodle bowl made out of rice??? Long story short, we simply walked out after finding they took out the gluten free noodles from their menu and went over to Saigon for some gluten free Pho.  Won't go back unless they bring the gluten free noodles back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland, and tasteless food. Should not even use the name \"ramen\" to describe what they serve."}
{"text":"I stopped into this restaurant while trying to kill time waiting for a concert at the house of blues, and it was amazing! The waitress was super friendly and really helpful with recommendations on what to eat. I had the \"super\" salad and two of the steam buns: the japanese friend chicken and the pulled pork. The steam buns are fantastic! I could seriously just order 5 of the Japanese fried chicken ones and be more than happy. If you go here, you must try the steam buns, they are that good.   My friend had one of the gf/vegan noodle options and she loved it as well. This place definitely deserves a shot, it is very delicious."}
{"text":"After living in NYC next door to a ramen place, we have been missing ramen since we moved to Ohio. Noodlecat was the closest one, which was still and hour drive. So for Valentine's dinner I took my fiancé to Noodlecat, and wow what a mistake. The ambience is pretty grimy, and where to I begin with the ramen. We both tried the homemade noodles but different styles. I had the pork and she had the chicken. They were both mostly inedible. The noodles were like eating playdough and the broths we both terrible. We thought the chicken broth most closely resembled some sort of cleaning supplies.  We sat at the bar and the service was OK. Don't expect good service, it's more of an order at the bar and take back to any table sort of place.  Overall we were both extremely disappointed and didn't come close to finishing our meals. $50 later we went to Flannery's around the block to have a real dinner.   Won't be going back and wouldn't recommend Noodlecat to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Honestly nothing too special. Was slightly expecting more and better quality"}
{"text":"Loved the food and bartender recommended drink specials were top notch. Great stop for great atmosphere, food and service. I will recommend to all friends and family when they are downtown."}
{"text":"I think this may be Cleveland's only Ramen option which is better than nothing but given that I have seen what other cities have to offer, Noodlecat needs to step up their game. Got two of their buns, the burger and the chicken one; both were average and not very memorable. Got the pork based ramen; solid amount of meat included but didn't taste like a \"real\" ramen joint. Would come back once in a while if I had the craving but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I've been to other ramen places in California, very authentic and delicious. So I wasn't sure what to expect out of a more hippie ramen place, such a noodlecat. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The noodles were delicious and full of flavor. I had the misu pork, which I'm told is the most popular choice. It was great! Very rich, I barely even finished half the bowl. So unless you're starving, you'll probably end up taking half of it home (which isn't a bad deal at all!). My husband had the spicy octopus, which isn't soupy, it's more like a stirfry bowl, and he said it was also delicious. I wasn't overly impressed with the steam buns, but probably that's cause the ramen was just too delicious to be impressed with anything else at that time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. I know this this chef sawyers concept, and was crowdfunded to open in Cleveland. I always heard about this place, and finally got a chance to go here with some friends. Let's just say I will not be going back. I ordered the Pork Miso Ramen, and there was 0% taste of Miso. The pork tasted like Canned Army brand pork you pick up at international food stores. The broth was fatty and mucky. The pork belly bun was good, but very expensive for the price. If you want a good noodle experience go to Payne Ave and try the local Asian good places( there are a lot) of authentic places that are friendly.  This is a great location for a business and I wish someone who cared about the menu and gave authentic great tasting food would take over this place."}
{"text":"Was so excited for this ramen place (heard good reviews when it was in Cleveland). It is a bit pricey for cafeteria-styled seating and everything is served in cardboard (even when you are staying in to eat). I did love the spicy vegan dan dan ramen bowl, but it was a bit expensive for what you get and the atmosphere is meh. Had potential, but overall nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I love the food however I always get better service and quality when I dine in. Tonight marks the THIRD time I have ordered to go when they forgot the protein (chicken) even though we were charged it when ordering the DanDan. Pretty frustrating. Also it seems to be much drier when we order take out. Not sure why that is. We love dining here but the inconsistency in take out is really frustrating.  **i want to be clear that we do not live in Cleveland and seek this place out because the flavors are so good. To not be able to order reliably is discouraging. We may need to look elsewhere for more consistency."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and wasn't entirely disappointed. I had the Takahachi Ramen, Tonkatsu Steam Bun, and a Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun to top it off. We also shared some Miso BBQ Twice-Cooked Crispy Chicken Wings. Was the ramen authentic by any means? Not really. But Noodlecat is more of a fusion place than anything else, so I wasn't expecting it.   Aside from the prices being a little steep, my main complaint was the server. Although he was incredibly nice and polite, the overweight man had an intense body odor so bad I couldn't eat while he was standing near the table, and had sweat stains swooping around the collar of his shirt.   All in all, I'd most likely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I used to be a Noodle Cat fan 2 years ago before I had moved to other state. I brought my friends and recommend them to try my favorite ramen today; unfortunately; we were disappointed with food&service.  I don't know what is going on. Do they change a chef or recipes? The noodle in my husband 's bowl was undercooked. My salad came out later than my ramen (so I asked them to pack for taking out). My friend's ramen was not ok, he tastes and returned to the kitchen. My favorite ramen was different from the past 2 years. They served ramen without spoon for us. The server explained that she could give plastic spoons instead of that (did anyone wash spoon? Or they change the way to serve?) However, we paid all of that, even we were very upset with our food.  So sad and sorry to my friends:( Won't be back again"}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with the other reviewers--overpriced and overspiced.  I had the octopus & bone marrow takoyaki, with the Toyko ramen noodles w/ pork shoulder (and dipping broth) as the main course.  Both dishes were altogether too salty, with heavy jolts of MSG.  I literally left with a headache and $25 less in my bank account.  The Tokyo noodles in particular displayed nothing of the simple, clean flavors that define East Asian cuisine.  While I don't need my pork cooked Asian style (in cooking wine to get rid of the gaminess), the various components of a dish shouldn't be overtly competing for my attention.  Over the top."}
{"text":"Definitely go for happy hour- everything is half off. I would recommend getting a bunch of steam buns. I wasn't a big fan of the noddles.  I tried the Ohio Beef Brisket and Matzo Ramen. There was barely any meat, the broth was pretty bland and the matzo ball was on the hard side (I prefer soft matzo balls!).  I tried the BBQ Pork and Japanese fried chicken steam buns. Both were quite tasty. I liked the bit of spice in the BBQ sauce. The fried chicken had the right amount of crunch to juicy chicken. I had the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun for dessert. It has a lot of peanut butter, but it was gooey and delicious. It also comes with a shot of milk.  The servers and friendly and willing to help explain the dishes. I'll probably go back for some happy hour steam buns in the future."}
{"text":"When we walked in, we expected a great ramen restaurant. However, this was not the case.  My husband and I had Szechuan ramen and Miso ramen, both of them were total disappointments. Both of us lived for several years in Japan and both of these dishes have absolutely no right to be called ramen. It was not good soup, miso  soup came out cold and flavourless. The noodles to me tasted like a package noodles. They used pulled pork instead of chashu pork. While I understand they were trying to americanise the ramen it just did not work for me.   They need to work on the flavour of the broth, make sure noodles are cooked and dish comes out warm!   The Szechuan ramen was just a complete disaster. The broth was just spice no flavour and noodles were like miso ramen described above.   If they can match the soup taste with the environment then it would be a spectacular restaurant.   **** The second star is for the environment and their selection of beer which is great!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! Service not so much. Waitress was short with us and made us feel unwelcome :( maybe it was the end of her shift but it was really weird. The hot sauce is super hot but good on the noodles--- it makes your nose run and you'll figure out that they need thicker napkins!! Lol"}
{"text":"I'll say this for Noodlecat - and I'll say it to the haters who find its menu lacking in authenticity: this is the only ethnic restaurant where I have been able to happily eat with my parents. Ever. And that is no small feat. To offer an Asian-inspired menu, the palatability of which is broad enough to reach the tastebuds of my meat-and-potatoes papa is nothing short of incredible.   On a recent visit, my husband, mother, father, and I sampled from across the menu:  - Roasted Brussel Sprouts - a favorite. - Pork and Brisket Steam Buns - a crowd pleaser, to be sure. - BBQ Miso Chicken Wings - another fan favorite. You're on a roll, Noodlecat! - Pork Miso - lacking in vegetable and a tad rich, but very enjoyable - Dan Dan Noodles - the clunker. Spicy, but that was the only flavor. Otherwise, quite bland.  The service we received last Saturday evening was almost comically bad! Our poor waiter clearly had no idea what he was doing. I have empathy for sub-par service: waiting tables is not everyone's chosen career and it's difficult work! I won't knock a restaurant based on the actions of a hapless 20-something earning tips to pay for beer and text books, but this lack of professionalism certainly didn't add to the experience.  Bottom line: if you want authentic ramen, you have plenty of other choices. If you want a fun, fairly affordable meeting spot downtown where you can score some flavorful appetizers before a show, Noodlecat is a great pick!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Not the noddle cat I frequented downtown. The noddle were dense and gummy. Not the Ohio City Ramen noodles of the past. Got the college ramen. Missed the old corn...and way too many peas...YUCK."}
{"text":"Noodle cat killed it this evening. The food was impeccable. My fiancé and I are longtime fans and heard about their new menu and have been wanting to check it out. They consoladated the menu a bit and went to a more build your own style setup. It works perfect, you check off what noodles/rice you'd like, and then what toppings to go with it. I got the BBQ short rib udon, and my fiancé the pork miso with house ramen. We also shared 4 assorted steam buns.  Let's start with the steam buns. Excellent. Every single one. We got one with a burger, one spicy fried chicken, another with tempura veggies, and finally one with pork belly. The pork belly stuck out the most, seasoned perfectly and just melted in the mouth. I was really astounded by the quality and care taken in preperation of all the buns. If you are looking for a light lunch or snack they are worth going in just for these little buns. I didn't think it could get much better until I received my BBQ short rib. For a place that is known for ramen, it should be praised even more for its BBQ. I was quite possibly the best BBQ pork I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory, and a surprisingly lovely kick of spice as it goes down. The udon was also made deliciously with an enveloping hot broth. We were so pleasantly overwhelmed with their new menus taste. They were understaffed from a server calling off and not getting his shift covered, and still getting used to a brand new POS system from the new menu, and busy for dinner. But the bartender and server were working very well and let us know the situation and really worked their butts off to keep everyone happy. And they succeeded with us tonight! And to top all of it off all the food is supplied by the local Westside market. This is something very important and close to me personally, and I applaud them for being a part of the local cleveland food market.  All in all please go support Noodle Cat, you will leave with a whole new look on gourmet ramen!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery lastnight....took over 1 hour! I had to call you to get an update, not you call me.  And then no discount of any sort? Gyoza was cold and no longer crispy (not true gyoza btw).  Pork miso ramen warm and needs a LOT more flavor!! Where was the egg?  More veggies please! Add spicy seafood ramen and shio ramen to the menu. Maybe I'll have a better experience if I ate onsite vs delivery?"}
{"text":"Hello noodle nirvana!   On today's visit I picked up the Hangover Ramen ($14.99) and a Fried Chicken steam bun ($3.99) as carry out.  The service was fast and efficient even though it was their first day open and very busy. Everyone working had a smile on their face and seemed almost as happy as we, the eaters did, about finally getting our eager paws on some tasty noodle treats after a long wait for the Crocker location.  As carry out both items remained hot and fresh and properly textured (thank you for the warning on the holes in the bowl lid as I would have worn mine without the head's up)  The ramen broth was rich and flavorful and gently coats your mouth as you eat it, the noodles perfectly cooked with just the right chew, the pork tender, the bacon and fries (which had a nice kick of spice) a perfect contrast of crunch and the egg cooked to yolky porn perfection.   The chicken thigh meat on the bun was crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle, with just the right spice offered from the pickle/catsup/miso mayo combo.  My only tiny critique would be it would be nice to have little packets of hot sauce or little plastic ramekins of it to take to go, as you don't know spice level till you taste the food and squirting it on in-store might ruin the chef's intended flavors. (Maybe that's just a first day open thing though?)  Overall a warm, filling and very satisfying lunch! Cannot wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"Surprised to see so many mixed reviews... It took me years to try Noodlecat for some reason, but every time I've been its been great. I especially recommend happy hour. Great drink specials and great prices on steam buns and noodle bowls. The fried chicken steam buns are awesome!  It's a small place and the bar gets crowded but service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: This place has a good vibe.   Service: Our waitress was missing for a while but when she came back, she was amazing.   Food: Try the pork bun and make sure you eat it first because it will soggy on the bottom. I also tried their noodle in a milky white broth + summer squash + jalapeno ..it was good."}
{"text":"After living super close to it for over a year, I finally tried noodlecat the other night. I didn't actually dine in. I live a few blocks away so (begin judgements on how lazy I can be now), I had it delivered. Now, I promise I'm not THAT lazy! Usually, I would just walk over, but a) I was feeling kind of sick and b) it was so cold :(  -- ok I'm done making excuses, I promise.  Anyways, so I ordered delivery- they offer delivery to people who live within a few mile radius (the website says the boundaries are from Lakeside to Carnegie and from West 25 to East 30th). She told me my order would be 45 minutes and they were in my lobby in less than 30, which was nice.  I kind of thought the food was MEH. I got half of the Spicy Tofu Udon and half of the Japanese Chopped salad without the bacon. I also got one Tempura Onion Steam Bun. I got all this anticipating I'd have some leftovers for the following day, but I definitely didn't realize how much leftovers I'd actually have. The half orders are fairly big! So, I'm sure the full orders are HUGE!  As far as the taste goes, the noodle soup was pretty sour and salty. I know noodle dishes usually are, but that taste in this bowl just overpowered every other flavor and I wasn't really a fan.  The salad was meh as well. It was missing avocados, which the description says it has - the dressing was bland - it was a \"tofu ranch\" but there just wasn't much taste to it, and it was super runny. I liked the idea of a soy braised egg on the salad, but the soy just made the egg super salty and inedible. My favorite part of the meal was the tempura onion steam bun. It was absolutely DELICIOUS and had the most taste out of everything I ordered. I will for sure be checking this place out again to get more of these. And, maybe I'll try some different noodle items- hopefully they have more taste to them. Judging by some reviews, they do, so maybe I just ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"I really like Noodlecat!  Ever since the downtown location closed, I've been eagerly awaiting the opening at Crocker Park! Most of the other ramen shops in Greater Cleveland are located closer to downtown or on the east side, so it's nice to have a good option that's close to home.  I still have to try that place in Lakewood though...  I've been to Noodlecat a few times and I've always enjoyed my meal and the friendly service.  Chef Sawyer changed the format from a standard sit-down restaurant to a fast casual concept and I think it works out pretty well.  My girlfriend and I went there during their first or second week of business and the crowd was pretty crazy, but the line moved quickly.  The steam buns we ordered were okay, but for $3.99 each, they should've been filled with more meat and veggies like the baos at Xinji in Ohio City.  (Their baos are delicious)  Maybe the buns have changed since then, so I'll order some again next time and see.  The ramen bowels are a good sized portion and will definitely fill your belly!  Check my pics and you'll see!  I've had the Pork Miso, Fried Chicken, and Hangover ramen and they've all been loaded with tasty meat, fresh chewy noodles, and rich, fatty, delicious broth! They have definitely nailed down the broth recipe.  The thin Japanese fries they put on top of the Hangover ramen was a bit much, but it was still great. I enjoyed the fried chicken drumstick and kale that come with the fried chicken ramen.  The Pork Miso is probably my favorite of the three..lots of meat and great broth flavor!  I always add a soft boiled egg for $1, but you can add double meat, double noodles, or sauce, etc for an additional charge.  They also have salads, udon and soba noodle dishes, and a few apps, but I haven't tried them yet. For beverages, they have a fancy soda fountain, three kinds of bubble tea, and assorted Asian beers by the bottle.  Seating is a bit tight inside, but once the patio opens up in the spring, that should improve.  This place has had a lot of bad reviews, much like the downtown location did and I don't really understand it. I think it's pretty good!  Give it a try and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"The menu layout was confusing.  They also do have some options for kids meals, but don't list them on the menu.  The food was tasty and reasonably priced.  The staff was super friendly and very helpful.  I might have missed it, but the hours aren't listed on the outside so at first we weren't sure if they were open.  It appears they are going through a reinventing process right now as they are on \"Menu v4.0\" as they call it.  The décor is interesting.  My wife and I got a kick out of the comic strip artwork detailing the adventures of NoodleCat.  Lol"}
{"text":"Ramen is good, as is ability to customize your noodle bowl with whatever noodles, broth, and toppings you'd like.  Enjoyed the Sriracha broth with curly noodles, Korean short ribs, and soft egg.  The Sriracha added a bit of spice and depth to the broth without overpowering it, and the short ribs were crunchy outside, chewy inside, and well marinated.  Service was a bit slow even though it was not crowded when I came."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad and wasn't good. The food is so-so. Pretty expensive for what you actually get. The noodles were not really flavorful. Wish they had more vegetable options with the noodles. As far as the atmosphere goes- the restaurant is designed well but dirty. Stuff needed to be stocked and cleaned better. Probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"Noodlecat is average.  Mediocre.  I had a different expectation level of this restaurant than what I found upon a recent visit to dine here.  With a Chef as ace as Jonathon Sawyer the dissatisfaction is only compounded further.      In fairness to Noodlecat, my one and only visit here occurred the day of a very important Cleveland Cavs playoff game, a couple hours before it started.  Downtown flooded with thousands of people and the dining room was packed to capacity.  I couldn't help but feel sympathetic to the service staff- which consisted of 2(?!!) servers and 1 bartender.  On the other hand, as a business, why wouldn't you staff your operation properly for an obviously high sales period?        Cocktails arrived only after waiting for 40 mins, my wife went to the bar to inquire- and returned with our drinks.  To their credit, they apologized profusely and comped our drinks for the whole dinner.  Tip of the cap to them for that.      Steam buns were just meh level.  The fried chicken in particular was a let down.  Reminiscent of a chicken McNugget in sweet chile sauce.  There wasn't much other accoutrements in the bun.      I actually enjoyed the Pork Miso Ramen.  The chewy texture of the noodles were very good.  The broth was decent.  The eggs were a little too hard boiled- which I would've preferred softer.  There wasn't much other complexity to the dish.  From my experience many other competitors in the ramen game offer more complex versions- and therefore are ahead of the level where noodlecat operates.        I would definitely come back and eat again.  And if you find yourself in downtown Cleveland I would recommend coming in and eating."}
{"text":"Maybe I've just been to many an Asian places in my life. The ramen bowls are a bit expensive, some of them don't come with soup, so make sure to ask your server. Two of my friends got ramen bowls with broths that were super salty. Steam buns were also on the menu, you can get a plate of three and choose among 3 meats (pork belly, fried chicken and a fish). Unfortunately you cannot mix and match the meats. So we got pork belly and fried chicken. Plate comes out in a do it yourself fashion, which included cole slaw, flat steamed buns, meat...I thought the buns were meh....definitely fresher and sweeter at other places (sorry born and raised in LA where ramen and steamed buns are done right). Would choose the fried chicken over the pork belly if I came back but realistically I don't think I would sorry NoodleC."}
{"text":"I won't say anything of the food, enough people have left accurate enough descriptions and it seems no one seems to care but in the hopes that someone reads this, food aside, the music was by far the worst part of the experience.  Not only was it incredibly depressing, but it was simply too loud to be ignored. Slow tempo pop hits from the 80s played on a cold, overcast Tuesday afternoon- not uplifting or appetizing in any way. Literally the kind of music most consistently played in goodwill or savers.   My idea, some Japanese pop songs played at a lower volume could do a lot more for this place. But if it absolutely has to be outdated American 80s hits, then a lower volume would be cool too."}
{"text":"Special note: I know I shouldn't compare it to packaged ramen noodles, but I did...so? Now what? LOL...on with my \"review\"  So, after a few years I finally decided to try Noodlecat. I walked by the restaurant and saw a guy eating ramen noodles and for some strange reason, I wanted to eat some ramen noodles too lol.  The reason why I thought it was strange and why it took so long for me to try Noodlecat was because of it being ramen noodles. I find it the meal to eat when I'm broke, there were times when I ate it so much I thought I would never in my life eat it again. Well Friday night I wanted some, along with trying out a steamed bun (or two).    I know this will come off as silly but I wasn't too happy with the bar stools at the table. I like backs to my chairs lol, somewhere I can hang my purse. I didn't realize the only area that had backs to the chairs was the bar area but it was too late because I already settled in (ugh what is wrong with me lol). On the table there is a clipboard with copies of the menu and the server was giving walking me through on how to order, which in my opinion was pretty self explanatory. Made my choices and was anxious to dig in. The service was okay, I ordered a drink but my server forgot to look at my entire menu selection (which also carryover to the back) and he really didn't check on me at all...didn't get the \"your meal will be ready in a few moments\" or something along those lines. At one point as I was looking down eating the mushy, tasteless ramen and a guy came out of nowhere and grabbed the two empty bowls and just kept walking. It did startled me a bit, looking up asking myself \"does he work here?\"  As I stated above, the ramen was very mushy and tasteless...didn't enjoy it at all.  When I am in the mood for at home ramen, I do like it to be a little bit firm. I was making myself eat the rest because I didn't want to be hungry later in the day. I also ordered two steamed buns...the pork and the fried chicken, now those were good, especially the chicken.  It does get a little messy but the sauce was yummy delicious so it was worth it. I kind of wished I should've swapped the bowl of coconut ramen for two (or three) more steamed buns.   This actually would have gotten less stars if it wasn't for the steamed buns, which would be the reason for a return visit. Other than that, no noodles for me.   Oh and can I say the bowls were really cute?  What I ordered: *Nama Ramen, flavor Coconut Curry Tonkatsu *(2) Steamed Buns - Fresh Bacon and J-Fried Chicken *Poloma (drink)"}
{"text":"I was SO looking forward to this place opening since I just moved to town from Los Angeles and I was craving ramen. I was so excited that they had vegetarian options, so ordered the Agedashi Tofu and Udon.  The Agedashi was... well I could have made a better one at home. The Udon broth was below par and the noodles were undercooked. I tried to tell the server, and he tried to tell me that it was was supposed to be that way... umm..ok.. I've eaten Udon at the best ramen places in Orange County and I KNOW what the texture of Udon is supposed to be..   $17 later, which is WAY overpriced, I felt sad because I wanted to like this place so much.. Oh and did I mention I felt sick from the food on the way home?"}
