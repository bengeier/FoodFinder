{"text":"Zipang is one of my favourite sushi restaurants. The food is always fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, with a solid menu, well executed. Decent vegetarian selection including the miso soup if you are willing to wait for a batch to be made without fish. (We called ahead with our reservation this last time and they confirmed this special request when seating us.) They also have a gluten-free selection as well, including tamari.   My partner raves about the fish here; on our last visit, he said it was the best he'd had in a year (and we've eaten A LOT of sushi in the past year). Bonus for ginger fans: I have never seen a sushi restaurant provide this much ginger with each meal! Take out orders as well.   Reservations are definitely recommended, as they are frequently very busy."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  The food was the best Japanese I've had in the city. Great atmosphere. And the staff very attentive."}
{"text":"Having lived on the west coast of BC for many years I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to quality sushi. When Zipang was recommend to me as a place to check out(by another ex-vancouverite), I eagerly anticipated my visit.   The sashimi and sushi  are excellently prepared, presented and the quality is unbeatable. Classic rolls along with a few of their own unique twists.    Don't miss out on trying their specials of the day usually listed on the chalk board as you walk in. If they have the braised black pork belly, order it. The first time I tried it, I actually had an emotional reaction it was so good and brought such pleasure to my senses.  Had I not ordered the last serving they had, I would have ordered a second(shhh, don't tell my doctor, everything in moderation right? including moderation).  The service is fast, friendly and efficient too.   Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.   5/30"}
{"text":"I will not go back to this place for many years again.  I had the worst service at this restaurant or I should say the server we had was terrible.  I had to mention to her that i didn't get my food while everybody at my table was eating since she never came by to check up on us.  We always had to flag down for her attention.  Not only she forgot to order my food, she didn't even apologize for her mistake nor expedite my food order.  She told me that my food is coming out in 5 minutes but that was a lie.  My food showed up 25 minutes after everyone from my table finished their food.  I also noticed that she didn't even smile once while we were there.  Food is good (i only had appetizers since I cancelled my main course after eating everybody else's left over) but if you get a younger girl server who doesn't crack a smile, ask for another server.  She was unpleasant!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Calgary. They always have the freshest fish, best service, and most authentic dishes. It's expensive, but it's worth every penny to not eat the same garbage sushi other places serve."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in all of Calgary. It's authentic, with lots of great fresh options. Sushi in general is expensive here, given that we live in a landlocked area -- but, I consider this one of the only acceptable options here worthy of my $$$! It's always packed so I would always recommend making a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"If I could give half stars, this place would get 2.5 stars. I did find this place to be a little on the expensive side.  The decor was very nice and the service was excellent but the food was just ok for the price.   We beef tataki was nicely done with a decent ponzu sauce and nicely presented. The agedashi tofu was good, although not the best I've had (my favourite is still the one from Wa's). We also ordered the grilled salmon belly and the black cod. The salmon belly was nice and crispy although not all that flavourful. I don't get what all the hype is about for the salmon belly. The grilled black cod was tasty with a slightly sweet glaze on it.  The assorted tempura was pretty good - nice and flaky and light. We also had an order of assorted sushi and assorted sashimi. Both were ok.. the fish was fresh and the portions decent... but again, nothing spectacular.    The strangest dish of all was the ton katsu. One of my dining companions wasn't a big fan of raw stuff. So we ordered the ton katsu (breaded pork chop) for her. Traditionally it's normally served as a don (i.e. served in a bed of rice). Zipang chose to do something \"fusion\" with it. Instead of serving it on rice, it came with a side of COLD mashed potatoes and chilled blanched asparagus and a couple of wedges of tomatoes.  The breaded pork chops were fine... tender and not overly dry. However, I just don't get the cold mashed potatoes. It's not like it was mixed with anything to be a potato salad. I haven't come across any culture that enjoys COLD mashed potatoes so far!   Given that the prices are a little higher than usual and the food is not all that impressive, I won't be going out of my way to go there any time soon."}
{"text":"It is in the name. \"Sushi Bar\". Zipang has some of the best sashimi & sushi this side of Vancouver & Toronto.   This is a traditional sushi restaurant, not a fusion place, not an izakaya. They have a large variety of fresh raw fish and that is what they are good at.   Please do not go to Zipang for tempura, donburi or other \"normal\" Japanese cooked dishes. It is the equivalent of going to a steak house and complaining that the chicken salad isn't good.   If you are willing to be a bit more adventurous, there are some less well known cooked dishes that are pretty good. The cold soba noodles are good, they have some grilled fish (i.e. mackerel) that are tasty and the daily specials all are a little off the beaten track for Calgary Japanese food.   The highlight for me (and many other patrons at zipang) has to be the heads on shrimp sushi. This is one of the few places in Alberta that I have found that serves fresh shrimp sushi with good flavor. To top it all off, the kitchen will take the left over heads and deep fry them to make a delicious dessert (think Asian shrimp chips).   The price is a little steep but considering that almost the entire restaurant was filled with Japanese families it appears that there are some people in Calgary who appreciate what Zipang is offering."}
{"text":"Zipang is probably the best place in Calgary to eat the authentic Japanese sushi. My wife and I go there regularly since it opened years ago."}
{"text":"A few of us often come here from work for lunch and it is definitely a treat! We love their lunch menu, of course our eyes are always bigger than our stomaches but worth every bite. Especially the sashimi. They give very generous portions and the food is outstanding! Service is also friendly and quick. Be sure to get there early enough if you don't have a reservation!"}
{"text":"not the first place that will cross my mind when thinking about sushi. this place is small and busy, make sure you have reservation if you're going with a party larger than 2 by the time we were seated, they didn't have a lot left. the agedashi tofu portion is normal and more tradition, i likes we ordered the seafood tempera, it was different and pretty good. the rolls tastes good, but it's not that memorable. i would go bad to sushi bar zipang, but it's not somewhere that i'll proposely go to  price wise(the more $, the more expensive): $$$ food quality: ««« services wise: CCC"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I've been to in Calgary.  It's quaint, clean, has a great atmosphere, friendly servers and talented sushi chefs.  One of my favourites is the Zipang roll.  Don't overlook the salads and other non-sushi items on the menu.  The house salad is very fresh and has a tasty sesame dressing.  The vegetable tempura is \"just right\" - not soggy or too greasy.  If you plan on going on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll likely have to make reservations a few days ahead."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a traditional sushi then you're at the right place. The sushi is always fresh. They have a few rolls but nothing too fancy. There is a sushi bar with very knowledgeable sushi chefs. There are tables all around probably good for small groups. The decor is simple but classy and appealing. Its definitely one of my favorite sushi places here in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get fresh sashimi in Calgary. Friendly staff. Always busy though...make reservations."}
{"text":"Zipang is pretty legit & authentic Japanese !! I lived in Japan for years. This is the only place in Calgary that even comes close to the real thing. No reason to waste your time anywhere else. Super Pricey compared to Vancouver Seattle Portland or San Francisco, but we are nowhere close to an ocean..........."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Zipang... I'd give it 5 Stars if I hadn't been to Hump in Santa Monica (which was the most ridiculous sushi restaurant I've ever been to... almost worth flying to Santa Monica for...)  Zipang is small now often busy (took a long time for people to 'find' it and (VERY lucky for me...) just down the street from where I live.  I've only ever been there for dinner and I've only ever had Omakase (trust the sushi chef to know what's good...)).  Excellent quality... excellent presentation and often innovative.  Service is very good.  It can be pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I've come to appreciate Japanese chef owned sushi joints in Calgary. This place is one of them where you know you won't walk out disappointed.    For Calgary standards, the fish is fresher than most places (I've had an okay wild salmon sashimi here once) and if you inform them you are gluten-free they will take it seriously! Freshly ground wasabi (gf) will be served but this also means that they won't be able to serve you some of their specialty rolls.   I love their grilled salmon cheek and the fresh shrimp sashimi. Remember to get the head deep fried afterwards for those non GF people - its flavorful!   Use to be able dine here with a same day reservation but not anymore so remember to call ahead."}
{"text":"I had only been to Zipang for lunch before this visit and I was very impressed with their dinner selection. The fish is extremely fresh and I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi. The extra special scallop nigiri I ordered was disappointing though as it was too dry and not creamy. The mayo had dried out unfortunately. The chicken karaage was crispy and flavorful. It's actually the exact same version as Roku's. The beef tongue was absolutely delicious. The braised black pork belly was melt in your mouth tender and so flavorful. I would order a bowl of rice to go with it to mop up all the sauce. It's a very busy little place so reservations are recommended although they seem to always have seats on the sushi counter available. I wouldn't hesitate to return for dinner. I actually prefer it over lunch. There's more selection and their small plates are perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Had been here several times before -- always a solid sushi option, probably the best in Calgary. But tonight's experience put them over the top for me.  My friend and I decided to get the omakase -- unadvertised, but they do offer it with a $75 minimum. You need to specify your budget, and they cater to your tastes/preferences/budget. We asked for a $100 per person omakase.   The first two courses were fantastic: the first was a sushi/sashimi platter with sea bass, hamachi, toro, salmon, scallops, and sweet prawns. The second course, a variety of hand rolls. We were ready for the third, but it never came.  Our server asked us soon after if we wanted to get anything else as there were no more courses. We were confused -- that was it for $100 per person? At most we had had about $60 of food per person (judging by their a la carte menu). We were pretty upset as we expected more for what we were going to pay.  When we got the bill it all made sense; there was a miscommunication with the waitress and she thought we wanted to pay $100 for the both of us. We had a good laugh about it with the chef/owner. At $50pp, we actually had a meal of pretty decent value. We were okay with this.  But nope -- the owner served us two more small courses as we \"probably weren't full yet\". It wasn't cheap stuff either, more hamachi, toro, and even uni (!!) He really did not have to, but the above-and-beyond service makes me look forward to returning and getting a proper $100 omakase in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Zipang many times b/c I used to live across the street.  Since I've moved, I now mostly go there at lunch.  It is quite small & usually busy so go early if you don't want to wait.  The lunch specials are nice.  You can pick two items from a list of about 10 for around $16.  I usually get the sushi (3 pieces of nigir and 3 small pieces of roll) and tempura (2 shrimp & 3 veggies).  This is served with miso soup and salad or rice.  Everything was very tasty and quick.  Definitely one of my favorite sushi lunches!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Japanese in Calgary.   I pity the suburban Calgarians with their view of how \"great sushi\" is done. I was horrified when I first moved to the prairies.   Zipang more than made up for some of the atrocities I came across.   The food in genuine, and delicious. I appreciate the daily features, along with the penciled in nigiri options. The fish is the freshest in the city, with varying options based on what was good that day.   This is the type of japanese joint you'll want to try something you've never tried before.   I enjoy sitting at the bar, watching the chefs work. When something I've never seen pops up, I usually order it.   Their black cod, along with the salmon jaw are honestly some of the best things I've ever eaten. If I was broke, and begging for money, and I had to choose something to eat, I would save up my pennies and get that cod to lift my spirits.    Their premium sake list is pretty good as well. (Something I generally don't find in Calgary)   I would sincerely suggest the bar, the fresh specials, some new nigiri, and a bottle of sake. Date night figured. You're welcome."}
{"text":"SO DARN GOOD. That is my thought when I think back to this wonderful sushi experience. Is the place small? Yes. Does the service lack a bit? When trying to get a drink, Yes. But man, oh man is the food amazing.  We sat at the bar when we arrived, I like watching the sushi chefs do their magic. We ordered a few rolls, some sashimi, tempura and beef tataki.   The sashimi was thick and fresh, the beef was flavoured just right and the rolls had a perfect ratio of filling and rice.  This will be one of my new go-to's for Sushi!"}
{"text":"i worked in calgary for about 6 months, and japanese food was extremely hard to come by. understandable considering that the nearest ocean was over a bunch of mountains called the rockies.  however, this gem of a spot is really really good. great sashimi. nice and tender karaage. smokey and delicious gyutan.  not a cream cheese filled roll in sight. heaven.  being completely owned and operated by japanese folks, it definately brings the right clientele. the staff are a little slow at times, but make up for it in japanese politeness and bowing. (not kidding). there is a reason that all the japanese business here in calgary flock here.   kampai!"}
{"text":"The reviews were so good, I was eager to take me sushi-lovin' galfriend to this local hotspot. We got their and it was rockin busy! We only got a table cause a reservation cancelled as we walked in. As usual, I got a huge selection of sushi rolls while the lady fair ordered some miso soup and some sashimi. I gotta say, not really that impressed and neither was my love. I didn't try any of sashimi but I got a whiff and the salmon was clearly off. She braved a couple pieces and regretted her choice an hour later. The rolls were ok but I've had better. I really hope that our  dinner was a one-off bad experience; unfortunately, I wont be able to convince my lady to a second visit :/"}
{"text":"Sushi Bar Zipang is hands-down the best sushi in Calgary. It's simply decorated, modest sized location in Bridgeland is always busy and full of regulars who return time and time again to enjoy their simply delicious sushi and sashimi.  Unlike other sushi bars, Zipang doesn't drown their sushi with heavy sauces and creams. Their fish is so fresh and tasty, you don't need a lot of extras to enjoy it.  Zipang often offers hard-to-find-fish like young yellowtail tuna and sea bass along with daily specials.  Service is friendly, fast and efficient. The owner is often behind the bar making sushi; he always greets his guests hello and thanks them for coming. We often see him walking around chatting with guests which is always nice to see.  Zipang is locally owned (not a mass producing franchise) which is great when you want to support local!"}
{"text":"Unless you really know the kind of fish you want in your roll, there's no special reason to visit this place. The standard roll options are limited and so is the menu in general. This place hires very junior staff so don't expect outstanding service. Do not come here if you wanna impress your date."}
{"text":"There is a reason why Zipang is considered the best sushi in Calgary year after year. Such meticulous care and attention go into everything here that I always have a positive experience whenever I visit. From the friendly staff, to the execution of the food, Zipang is a true gem in Bridgeland."}
{"text":"I am so pleased that we gave Sushi Bar Zipang a second chance, after receiving terrible service on our first visit.   We have been back a few times now, and are very impressed with the quality of the fish, the traditional preparations, the friendly staff, and the overall environment. You pay a bit more than some places, but you're paying for freshness! Also, portions are quite generous, with large slices of fish. A bowl of tuna/salmon don comes with beautiful, generous slices of fish; rolls don't have any 'filler' and are well done.   We have had tae out as well, which was tasty and efficient, yet not quite as good as enjoying it fresh in the restaurant.   This small, authentic, restaurant is now a local sushi favorite!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best sushi restaurants anywhere (Van, San Fran, Seattle, San Diego). Immaculately clean sushi prep and very friendly staff. Make a reservation or ante up to the bar if there's room."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Super delicious and wildly fresh. A bit on the expensive side but you're paying for the quality. Some of the best fish I've ever had in Calgary and definitely in my top three.   However, the service leaves a lot to be desired. Got there at 6:30pm. Was seated shortly after, received water about ten minutes after that. Order was taken fifteen minutes later. Then it went even more downhill. Received our sushi close to 8pm (again, so so delicious!). Finished our nigiri and the waitress came and asked if we were waiting for anything, which we were. About twenty minutes later, she came and let us know that the person entering the order hadn't noticed the udon and tempura on the bottom of the sheet (which she had confirmed with us when originally taking our order). We opted to just get our bill and leave. Note: we also only had our small tea cups and water glasses filled once in the entire two hour sitting and this was on a Tuesday night.   TL;DR: amazing food but don't go if you have plans afterwards.  Hoping to go back and have a better experience as the food was amazing and the servers were kind, despite the level of attention (or lack thereof)."}
{"text":"Decent sushi bar in decent location. Sweet prawn, sea urchin, and sea bream are the best sashimi in Calgary. Actually all sashimi are fresh and tasty. It's a place that I just don't want to say too much about it. Just come and eat, then you will like it."}
{"text":"Best place yet! Had the $150 steak which was delicious (slightly on the salty side, but sooo good)  Staff are friendly and welcoming  Sushi is always good and fresh! I always take my friends here because I Love their salmon belly dish   Only Wish they had more sake selection"}
{"text":"It is my first time there. We reserved by phone and the waiters/ waitresses are very friendly! There is a bar where you can look at the chefs working will enjoying the meal. Food came in at a timely manner. The wild salmon sashimi was amazing! House special roll tasted really great and full! Unfortunately the Urchin was not so fresh and tasted weird. I had to take it with ginger so that I can swallow it. And the special assorted sashimi totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The sushi was so fresh and the rice was soft and chewy. I definitely think this will be my new favorite sushi place in Calgary. However, everything on the menu was a little pricey, but so very worth it."}
{"text":"Money Dish:  Wild Salmon sashimi.  The taste and look of it is unbelievable.  For those of us who are used to and accepting of the pale pink salmon you get at most places, this dish will blow your mind.  The color is a deep healthy pink, and the taste is sooo fresh.  The price is a bit higher for this, but OMG, it's well worth it.  If you have never tried wild salmon sashimi, this would be the place to do it (before it's all gone from the oceans).  Other dishes were well done in the traditional way, so they were also quite good, a bit above the average sushi in Calgary.  Service is fast and pleasant, and the atmosphere is very relaxed.   I did take off one star for the higher prices,  but that should not deter you if you want to experience authentic and very well-done Japanese food and sushi for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is actually a 3.5. I have wanted to try this place forever, as it was recommended by some friends, who are picky sushi eaters. Made it down for dinner one night and not that impressed.  It was quiet so that was good, we were able to get a table. We sat at the sushi bar as it's easier and we're pretty quick. I did my usual sushi order, and the salmon that came was stupidly large. Like I had to cut it, so I could eat it. Sorry I'm not a fan of that. And my husband big complaint was the rainbow roll. They put avocado it in, as it's usually mad, plus the draped tons on the outside. My husband loves avocado, and said it was way too much.  Service was good, just not impressed with the sushi."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi but quite pricey.  They have some hard to find rare sushi selections. I love the grilled salmon belly.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Sushi Bar Zipang makes one thing so well, I would be happy to just eat it... Fried oysters in ponzu sauce (appetizer size). Don't mistake the appie with the main, which is a panko crusted fried oyster. I prefer the ponzo as the batter is light and melts in your mouth. The oysters are also cooked just so ... leaving the meat soft and silky. The panko oysters are larger and more well-cooked, and come with a heavier dipping sauce.  While I would prefer just to order 4 orders of the oysters in ponzu sauce, I stop myself because I also enjoy the chirashi (selection of sashimi on sushi rice) and nigiri. If you want a table, you better reserve at least 24 hours in advance. Place is packed every night."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and different menu items offered versus other Japanese restaurants.  The pork belly and chicken gizzards were things that we didn't normally expect to see. The place was packed when we went Friday night.  Atmosphere was nice and cozy.  Seemed to attract the urbanite crowd from bridgeland so not too many families in attendance.  Quality and price were appropriate. It will be a nice alternative to the always busy Shikiji further north.   They also were very good about answering our allergy questions.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Sushi: 7/10 Other Food: 3/10 Service: 3/10 Ambiance: 6/10  The sushi is average although the sushi chefs seemed very nice and asked how things were. That said, wait staff are horrible and very little attention was paid once we were sat. We waited forever for our hot food and once our chicken karage came out, it was cold. The second time it came out (after we sent it back) it wasn't much better. You could see the kitchen staff just lazing around. Food is extremely salty here. Water was never refilled.   I suspect they place priority on take out orders (and there were a lot of people who came in for that).  A scoop of matcha ice cream was our consolation prize for the unreasonable food delay and we wish they had just comped the chicken.  There are so many better sushi places. We won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi/Japanese restaurants in the city! Very well prepared and tasty sushi and sashimi and hot dishes as well. House Roll is very good, and sea eel (anago) some of the best in town. A little pricy, but you get what you pay for in quality and freshness."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi spots in Calgary that I've been to. Their fish is quite fresh and their menu is considerably authentic (although on the pricier side). Lunch menu is a pretty good deal as you can get enough food to fill you up for $14.   My only two complaints... I would suggest cutting your fish sashimi pieces thinner. And I would train your night staff to better understand the menu items."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the quality of fish after finding this restaurant on yelp. Bar seating was the best as we got to interact with the chef. Everything was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is probably best sushi in Calgary downtown area.  Must try : Pork cheek  Appetizer oyster ponzu sauce  Eggplant -meh All Sashimi is generally fresh and good except for squid and anago"}
{"text":"It gets packed around dinner time. Friendly staff. Decent sushi variety.   I like that they offer wild salmon as an option instead of the usual salmon that's always served in most sushi restaurants. The sashimi portions were good. The quality of the fish was great in general.   It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I picked up some food here on a Tuesday evening around 7pm. It was in a quiet area and it looks small from the outside. I walked in and it was -packed-. Every chair was full. And everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I was welcomed pleasantly into the restaurant and went and paid for my food. Quick and kind service. The food was great. I had a rainbow roll and a salmon roll. Both were delicious. I will definitely be back, and am looking forward to sitting down to eat next time to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic quick dinner here while visiting Calgary. Chopsticks are fancy and very elegant. No wood chopsticks here! Tempura dish included broccoli, green pepper, potato, sweet potato, and shrimp. Quick service and very friendly staff. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan as a vegetarian but I've also taken a couple of people there and they only got excited over the fancy rolls. It's very pricey for what it is serving but I don't get it. I'm glad to see calgary pick up their game in the sushi department as a vancouverite but would rather spend half my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chef Nao and his team provide by far the best quality and customer service I have ever seen at a sushi restaurant. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi in town  Bit pricey but their teriyaki steak is super authentic.. Their sushi is great  Only downside is their price but if you want a legit Japanese food here is the place to go"}
{"text":"The service is so awful it completely taints your opinion of the food. The fish is better than most sushi restaurants in Calgary, but the rice is below average. The restaurant gets very busy at dinner service and servers have an inability to clear out lingering diners, affecting the reservations they take later in the evening, causing a domino effect. Floor staff do the best they can but are clearly overwhelmed and unhappy. Could be training issues or that management that doesn't empower the staff to make decisions to solve the problems that pop up, but something isn't working. Flaws in the way they take reservations, fill orders and keep things moving make it a challenge to get your food on time and having a dining room packed to the gills means it is noisy and you are likely to be elbow to elbow with other tables. Returned here to see if it was worth knocking my No. 1 choice in Calgary off the top. It's not."}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves sushi, but has to avoid gluten.  I asked if they had gluten free soy sauce, and after that, it was on.  If you try to order anything that has gluten in it, they will advise you, and if possible make it for you in a gluten free way.  The service is great, the food is superb.  All of the chefs looked up and thanked us as we were leaving, which was unexpected considering how busy they were.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I last went to Sushi Bar Zipang. It must have had a reno since I was last there, because the inside was really, really nice. Everybody was very well dressed, so it felt like a super classy joint. It was pretty quiet, and good for conversation. The place was packed so we ended up sitting at the bar, and we had a nice little conversation with one of the chefs. His hands were like magic, he was moving so fast.  The large tempura we ordered was tasty, but took a while. I like mine a little more crispy, but it was definitely good. The salmon nigiri was tasty, nice and fresh and melted like butter in my mouth. The tamago and white tuna was also cut very nicely. I wasn't as crazy about their futomaki roll or any of the others. I'd like to back and try some of the tasty non-sushi items, as they had quite a selection of cooked japanese food. I was pretty disappointed as our food took a while (they did apologize) and it was hard when I was sitting there watching him make it!   My one fish with the joint is that it was much more expensive than some of my favourite sushi restaurants, and the price difference wasn't reflected in quality or quantity."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation by my brother!    You know you enter into a good place when the atmosphere and mood seems just right.  After a hot day 26C it was nice coming into a slightly dark room where there was a magnificent scent of rice wine vinegar seasoned rice and seafood!  The A/C was just perfect also!  Nice and cool!    I ordered a sunomono salad which was a very soft texture with a hint of lemon and a slight flavour of the sea!  Almost gooey but just amazing!  Then I ordered a small mixed tempura and three rolls (spicy rotate, Spicy tuna and BD roll).  All three had wonderful flavour and texture to them!    There are so many sushi places that crank out rolls with no care for the experience!  Zipang is what I look for in a sushi restaurant!  A very calming ambiance of a local sushi shop with excellent quality sushi!  A+ experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy toro!!! Small little intimate place off the beaten path. Never would've heard of it. My friend just said his Japanese teacher told him it's good and authentic. I was very impressed!!! I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"So came here during dinner time and I was surprise that this place fills up pretty quick. You need to make a reservation. So yes we did do that. Came here and I would say sushi is on the pricy side. If you order a la carte is not cheap. So we each did the combo. I got the umi combo.   The Umi Combo came with sashimi, tofu, miso soup, marinated salmon, rice and rib eye steak cut into pieces. I liked the sashimi the most. The sashimi were really fresh and has a nice sweet taste to it. The agadashi tofu was good as well. The marinated salmon is something you have to like. I find it ok because I am not a big fan of it. The steak was nice and it was marinated with sweet soy sauce. It also came with cold potatoe salad.   Service was not bad. They are smart to give us a 1 liter glass so we can refill our water glasses ourselves. The place is nice and clean. However it is small.   I do highly recommend coming here. Go for the sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"I guess you have to be an avid sushi fan to appreciate this place. The sashimi didn't come off to me like it was significantly more fresh than any other restaurant of the same price point. The tempura was very doughy. The only thing i thoroughly enjoyed was the eggplant, it was delish, and soooo savory.   Half way through the meal the restaurant became super smokey and oily. They really need a better ventilation system. i had to toss my clothes in the wash afterwards, or maybe their kitchen was having a crisis that day. All in all it was an ok experience. They don't have a lot of seating, and most of the tables are 2 seaters, but it is very spacey (you are not forced to have a convo with your neighbours). The service was also mediocre."}
{"text":"Best and fresh sushi in the city. You need reservations to come here because it's always busy and only open for dinner hours. The drink selection is subpar. All of the sashimi etc are fresh, great tasting. All the rolls are large, worth the $ and taste amazing. The freshest rolls around. Yes it's an expensive sushi place, definitely will cost to around $100 for 2ppl BUT worth every dollar if you love sushi.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"This used to be my place to go for sushi but last time I went, the restaurant was completely useless when the people who came after me became very loud; loud enough to disrupt the entire restaurant and clearly drunk. I voiced my displeasure to the staff twice but they opted to do nothing. I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Best & 5 Stars Sushi Place in Calgary! Food is always great, very good quality!  I love the Chirashi (Ryoushi no Donburi - Assortment of Fresh Sashimi on Sushi Rice)! Although it's pricey, the quality is good. It has Bontan-Ebi (spot prawn/head-on), can send to the chef for deep frying the head!  Make reservation, always busy there!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm. Being from Vancouver I'm very picky about my Japanese food. I had to ask a few friends I've made in town where I could go to get some Japanese food that wasn't made by Chinese or Korean people, and let them know that I hadnt tasted anything remotely like fresh sushi Since I left Vancouver.  Thank you to my awesome friend Amber, without you I would've never found the spot!  Vegan options, fresh ingredients, great staff, line up out the door.   There is no hyping this place, it's very very good.   I travel from Bragg Creek just to eat here."}
{"text":"Sushi Bar Zipang is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Calgary. It is also one of the most expensive one. If you're looking for a night out for the proper sushi treatment, look no further.   It is fairly popular, calling ahead and making a reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Calgary! Truly authentic with real Japanese Sushi Chefs.  Fish is very fresh and the portions are great.  Service is friendly and quick.  Everyone greets you as you come in and as you leave - it's such a nice touch.  Love the fact that they use REAL chopsticks and not the wooden ones which tend to break or give you slivers.    Only downfall was that we were seated right at the door which became a bit cumbersome with a cold draft.   They were very busy which is a good sign and also managed to do take-out orders as well.    Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2 stars for this place, we only came here because Le Brezza and Le Dolce Vita were fully booked. The food is mediocre and VERY pricey, it's around the same price as Globefish, the service was pretty decent, can't complain much on that."}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of this place.  I went with two of my really good friends.  One friend who doesn't eat seafood got a ramen bowl and was really happy with it.  Another friend that eats seafood (but no beef, chicken or pork) shared a roll with me.  She also ordered more sushi and was quite pleased.  I got the braised oysters, rice combo (rice, soup and salad) and was totally full.  I had no idea but the braised oysters comes with something that tasted like it was half mashed potatoes and half potato salad. It was delightful to say the least!  We all pounded back 2 beers each.  Dinner and drinks came out to just a little over $100.  Not bad at all!  Service was great.  It was busy on a Friday evening so we waited a little bit but they kept coming back to see how we were doing (important).  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! One of the best sushi places in Calgary now!! They have Super fresh salmon & tuna! All rolls we had were delicious!! And the miso soup was excellent! The service was very good as well!! My favourite thing was that They have uni! Which is not easy to find in Calgary! The prices were not inexpensive but not terrible pricey ... I would say, you pay for what you get... I would definitely go back there!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We always go there for special occasions. I would go there once a month if I'm rich enough! So far it is the best Japanese restaurant in Calgary. The owner is super nice and funny."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 Service: 1/10 Value: 7/10 Ambience: 6/10  TL;DR - Great food and portion but deplorable service  Remove the bad service and this place is easily 4 star.  The mackerel was great, and Sushi were huge, fresh, and yummy. The amount of fish in each rolls was the most I've ever seen.  The service was a nightmare, however. No napkins and no silverware even after we asked several times. The bill came with 2 glasses of wine we didn't order and took them forever to fix.  The table next to us was way too close, and they would not stop talking. The wait time was quite long as well."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in at Sushi Bar Zipang on a whim.  I'd heard it was one of the best sushi places in Calgary, so I wanted to see for myself.  We had already eaten a bit so only wanted a small taste of their sushi.  We tried their salmon sashimi and a spicy tuna roll.    The fish was phenomenal, on a new level of quality I've never tasted before.  The service and environment was very somber and unlike a lot of sushi places I've been to, however the fish was to die for."}
