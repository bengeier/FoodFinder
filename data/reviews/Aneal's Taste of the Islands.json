{"text":"Ate here two times now and food has been excellent.  I've tried the roti and the jerk chicken.  Both were very good and tasted authentic.  Owner was playing some nice tunes the day I was there which created a nice Caribbean atmosphere. This place would be even better if it had a patio to enjoy the beautiful summer weather.  Can't wait to come back and try rest of menu!"}
{"text":"The Caribbean food at Aneal's is absolutely incredible! We had the doubles, spicy beef patties, and the jerk chicken dinner. Everything was so fresh. I know it may sound cheesy, but you can tell the food is cooked with heart and soul. He even makes his own pepper sauce! It's spicy and filled with flavour!  Aneal is so warm and friendly. He made us feel like we were guests in his home. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. I can't wait to go back and try every single dish on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great spot with some super nice people. Had a tasty, medium sized roti and patties.  Very flavourful and their home made spicy sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to buy rice and peas. I drove by this place and decided to give it a try. Im glad I did. One of the best rice and peas I have ever had. Spice was perfect.  I will definitely be back to try the jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"One word: YUM! Had lunch with a couple friends and ordered the curry shrimp roti wrap and large stew chicken to share. Very large portion sizes!  I would not be able to finish the roti wrap on my own- No way. The curry shrimp filling was so good, saucy but not runny at all and nice pieces of shrimp. The stew chicken came with rice and coleslaw and did not disappoint. Chicken was tender, flavourful and spicy. The rice had a bit of a spicy kick too. Coleslaw was just right to give a nice break from the spiciness. For drinks, we got a couple bottles of Peardrax and a can of Angostura Lemon, lime and bitters. The restaurant was casual, clean and nicely organized. Aneal mentioned he'd have macaroni pie and doubles on Saturday so looking forward to takeout!"}
{"text":"Aneal's is a quaint family run establishment with a sit down area next to the Richmond Hill Performing Arts Centre on Yonge Street.  It is the ONLY place I ever go to when I have a craving for oxtail or shrimp or veggie roti (I love the new addition of the red snapper roti!).  Aneals' creations are all homemade and simply delicious.    He is an amazing person and cooks with love and the dishes prove it.  He takes the time to get to know his customers and he remembers the regulars usual orders.  He will take time to chat with you.  Come on in to Aneal's Taste of the Islands and see for yourself!  There is no comparison in York Region."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. The guy working was very rude maybe he was having a bad day I'm not sure. The food was mediocre and definitely overpriced. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great food (quality ingredients, full flavours, generous portion sizes) and fabulous customer service. Since discovering Aneal's about a month ago (thanks to Yelp) we have been going back repeatedly. A hidden gem in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"After reading a few good reviews about this place, my husband and I decided to drop by and give it a try.  Hard to find a good Caribbean restaurant around and we were very pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food.  I had a goat curry roti and it was delish!  My husband had the goat curry dinner and he liked it a lot too.  The prices are decent and the owner is very friendly.  Definitely will come back as it is so close to where we live!"}
{"text":"We ordered Aneal's for a family get together recently and we were first calling because we wondered how well they would handle severe allergies. Super delighted to report that not only did they take care of the allergies, they followed up repeatedly to make sure it was perfect.  Our order was large, but Aneal easily organized it and made sure it was available on time. Marrying into a Carribean family, I have learned to tolerate some pretty hot food but Aneal's homemade hot sauce is just one step past that. We also had a Double and it was amazing.  Aneal is fun and a pleasure to work with when taking orders. His restaurant is small but spacious and while we didn't dine in, we will when we return."}
{"text":"I came by here today for lunch and had the jerk chicken. I was asked whether I wanted it spicy and I of course said yes.   The jerk chicken was flavourful and well-balanced in flavour. This is not one of those overly clove-heavy jerks that really aren't my favourite. The meat was tender and the rice was cooked well and had a good amount of flavour as well. The reviews are correct that you do get an undressed salad on the plate. We were offered a tamarind dressing once we'd been served, but I'm not the biggest fan of tamarind so I passed on that.   What would be better than the undressed salad would be a bit of coleslaw that a lot of Caribbean places tend to do.   Service is quick and friendly. This is one of those \"order at the counter, they bring your food to you, and then you pay after at the counter\" situations. I don't think we waited even five minutes for our food.  I would definitely come here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to fullfill your Chicken Curry Roti cravings! I must say this is the one of the best in the GTA. Found this joint on Facebook last year and have been coming here since. Aneal the owner is very nice, which is also a plus! There's street parking northbound on Yonge. If you're running late, you can always give them a call and they will have your food ready for you."}
{"text":"Hot, moist, and saucy. That is how I like my roti. After settling an internal debate with myself over goat or chicken, I placed an order for a chicken curry roti ($8.99). Satisfied with the decision, I took a seat and noticed that this is quite a small but welcoming restaurant, decorated only with a few paintings.  Amidst my daydreaming, a nondescript square shaped mass arrived on a green checkered plate. Without much expectation, I pierced the thin roti and to my delight, a stream of sauce bled out. Saucy? Check. As I tossed the first bite into my mouth, the remaining two check boxes (hot and moist) were simultaneously checked off, and a fourth was added: flavour.  The curry itself is not too spicy, and perhaps even slightly shallow in flavour complexity. Yet that isn't to say it isn't tasty, because it is. It just lacks an immediate oomph. The addition of the pepper sauce assists in this department, slowly but surely building heat in the background as less and less of the roti remains. A partial check for the flavour box.  Within the roti were generous sized pieces of chicken, which ranged in doneness from juicy and succulent, to pieces which have seen their fair share of heat and hovering towards dryness.  As this was a very filling meal and checks off 3.5 out of my ad hoc 4 boxes, I would return."}
{"text":"Close to work, so we decided to come for our Friday lunch tradition. Ordered the jerk chicken and it's really good! Definitely will come back and try the roti!"}
{"text":"unfortunately, this place did not have any of the elements I like in the Jerk places I frequent.  1) they skimp on the serving size. The oxtail we ordered had very few pieces and each piece didnt have a lot of meat on it.  2) the Jerk chicken was obviously baked. However it was prepared it was definitely not grilled. It was as if they got bottled jerk sauce from the grocery, marinated and baked the chicken in it. If that was the case its a lot easier to make it myself.  As much as I like jerk chicken it appears I will still need to drive down to Toronto to get my fix. This is unfortunate as this place is rather close to where I live."}
{"text":"I was in the area yesterday and noticed that the former restaurant that inhabited this location was no longer there - in fact it had been gone for just over a year. In that time Aneal's Taste has opened bringing a little Island flavour to a virtually one dimensional and kinda drab, Village of Richmond Hill.  It was slightly after the lunch hour and empty (even of staff upon first look). After a short wait Aneal himself came out to give the other customer in the store his order and take mine. I went with the large jerk chicken lunch meal and decided to dine in. After taking my order he went to the back and I was alone out front.  The decor is simple but clean and classic, everything nicely organized and everything in its place. The music was a little strange as it sounded more like traditional Indian pop music rather than the Socca or Reggae I might expect from a Caribbean restaurant.  The food came out soon there after with about a half chicken (in dark meat) of Jerk chicken, a healthy portion of rice and beans and a small salad. As Erwin mentioned in his review, it's a baked/roasted version of jerk chicken (not grilled) but it was very moist (fall off the bone) and had a great spicy flavour none the less. The seasoning was great but I was missing that fresh off the grill taste that goes so well with Jerk Chicken.  The real surprise for me was the Rice! Wow, not something I get excited about all that often, save for a good Mushroom Risotto, but the rice and beans here are excellent. Jam packed full of beans and flavour, and moist! Not mushy, not dry, a perfect balance. You can tell they use fresh ingredients here as there were several fresh bay leaves scattered throughout the rice.  My only complaint would be the salad, plain, no dressing, small portion. Not that I need a lot of salad but there wasn't even an option for a dressing (I mixed it with my rice so I could get some flavour on it). Fresh produce though, I'll give them that!  Overall, a good experience and if in the neighbouhood, I'd certainly come back - I recommend you do as well  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a mix of Trini/Jamaican/Indian with a fusion of New Orleans! We ordered the oxtail and the jerk chicken combo and it was delicious! You have the option of having the non-spicy and spicy. We obviously had to order spicy! This ain't your typical tobascco spicy.  If you can't handle the spice then just order the non-spicy.  The oxtail was just Devine. It is fall off the bone goodness and is perfectly seasoned. The jerk chicken was also a delight. But if you asked me, I am all for the oxtail! I have to mention that he sells his hot sauce. He always makes a fresh batch and it always taste uniquely different each time.  They have a small and large portion option And I'd highly recommend the large! It's too good to eat only a small. This isn't a restaurant where you should be thinking about your diet. The restaurant is clean, the chef is friendly, and the food is good. What more could you look for in a restaurant? Did I mention that they serve all halal? The chef has his certification to prove it!  I will be coming back for more to try the other dishes on his menu! It's one of the best Trini/Jamaican/Indian food I've ever had! I highly recommended it!  I give it a 5 thumbs up! I will see you soon Aneal!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!! Tried it today for the first time and I loved it. I ordered the jerk chicken and it was perfect, moist and flavourful the rice and peas where really good too.. you even get a small size of coleslaw to cool down some of the spice lol. Oh and the patties are really good as well. Really good experience and I will definitely be visiting again. A must try!!"}
{"text":"I've had many many Roti's in my life from all sorts of places around Toronto. It is one of my favourite food.  To me, this place was okay, nothing special.  It's hard to go wrong with Roti's but it was somewhat cold."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout.    I really really wanted to like this place since it is close to home and I like to support local mom & pop restaurants every chance I get.  It's a shame that the food did not stand out.  I ordered the chickpea/potato roti and it was bland, even after smothering it with hot sauce.  Mr Leny said the same about his jerk chicken dinner.  We were quite disappointed and not sure that we will be back."}
{"text":"I likey! Delicious jerk chicken!! The jerk was a little different from what Im used to and I was told that it's because its is not Jamaican but Trinidad style jerk which was still delicious. I guess some of the spices used are different and this case different is good! If you get the hot sauce you will burn, but it burns soooo good!  Will be back when im in the area next!"}
{"text":"One word \"awesome\"  Me and my husband went there tonight to take out.. The owner was there and right away greet us. My husband wanted jerk chicken and oxtail, they didn't have this combo on the menu but the man said \"no problem, i'll make it for you\" witch made him really happy. The food was fresh and flavorful, the meat slide of the bones, the rice was tasty also. We took some beef paties and they were the best we had.   Definitely recommend this place! Go try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Such a small town feel with all the regulars that came in. And such kind service. The portions are huge too."}
{"text":"Delicious West Indian food!  Both the jerk chicken and the boneless chicken curry roti are amazing.  The hot sauce is HOT.  It's made with ghost peppers so there is a lot of heat.  The owner is a really nice man and gave us recommendations.  They also have different off-menu items every week so be sure to ask!  Great place to go when you are craving carribbean food.  Parking can be a bit of a headache as they don't really have their own lot so you will have to park on the street."}
{"text":"I am not sure why we are so lucky to have this little boutique restaurant in Richmond Hill. I say this as a long-time resident who has never really seen a culinary tradition take root in the \"Hill.\" Well, it looks like I may have been wrong. Aneal runs a beautiful little West Indian restaurant. From Jerk Chicken to the Curry fare, it's nice we have a little \"go to\" place for quick take out or to take a significant other to that isn't cost prohibitive. Lovely place. Keep it up Aneal!"}
{"text":"Take a chance on eating real island food in York Region.  Aneal's is a hidden gem in the heart of Richmond Hill serving quality, mouth watering, authentic Caribbean food originating from the Island of Trinidad & Tobago. Great curries, roti, pepper sauce and stews plus weekend specials make you feel like your on the island and just need a cold Carib to wash down your meal.    One visit will lead to two and then many.  Don't be in a hurry as each meal is prepared only when the order is placed and not a moment before. Trust me when I say it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love when I stumble upon a place that cooks their food with passion. Aneal makes all of his dishes and they are delicious! I had oxtail for the first time in my life and loved it. My girlfriend had the chicken curry and also raved about it. There are specials on Fridays that you should order ahead of time. We had Aneal's amazing bbq chicken with his wife's award winning Mac and cheese as takeout one Friday and both were huge hits with my family. Aneal's is a small place where you order at the counter and then have a seat at one of the few tables in the place. The food is delivered by Aneal himself and everything is cooked to perfection and just melts in your mouth. Portion sizes are good too. It's definitely spicy but I love a little kick in my food so I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here for take out. Was really excited to find out there was a place like this so close to me. Its a small place but cozy. Parking is across the street or there is  street parking. Ordered the shark and bake and curry chicken. It was really good! Rice and peas was made perfectly. Really nice people. Make sure to ask for cutlery. Watch out for the pepper sauce! Very tastey but has a real kick!"}
{"text":"Although it's quite difficult to find a Caribbean restaurant in Richmond Hill, if you're craving jerk chicken and/or roti this is the place to be! My boyfriend and I ordered the jerk chicken, curry chicken roti and the shark and bake. The shark and bake was by far the highlight of this meal and I would highly recommend all the foodies out there to give it a try."}
{"text":"Great little find in Richmond Hill.  We had the chicken curry roti and jerk chicken plate. All very good and a fair amount of food. Heads up, medium is spicy there! Lol  The owner is super friendly and they offer weekly specials that aren't on the menu.  We'll be Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place, food is great.  Very friendly! I will be back for sure. If you are looking for parking when you stop by, it looks like you can park on the n. Side of richmond, in what looks like a business complex, or gov. type building.  The restaurant is small, or you could say only as big as it needs to be.  I would imagine most of their business is takeout. For the trini's out there, they make shark and bake on Saturdays, sometimes Fridays."}
{"text":"Hey all you \"yelpers\" I literally just joined Yelp so I could write about my first experience at Aneal's Taste of the islands. In order for me to go to such great lengths must mean that I must have experienced something terrible that I want to share or something amazing...in this case it is the latter of the two, I ordered the Jerk chicken with rice and peas and I have to say that it was phenomenal! It was the best jerk I have had in a long time! perfect level of spice (I like mine on the hot side) fall off the bone chicken and not your plane old rice with peas. I am definitely a return customer and it's so close to home I feel blessed lol. Great food, very nice people/owners..."}
{"text":"Had the small jerk chicken. Small portions, overpriced and food is nothing special. Go to Ninas Tropical Island instead for more and tastier food for cheaper."}
{"text":"Awesome food! People are great! I was looking for a good jerk dinner, and this came up. The reviews do not lie! YOU GOT TO EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in the mood for some SERIOUS homefood, and saw Aneals on Yelp.  I had driven past this location many times before -after today's experience I will definitely be a regular! The goat roti was delicious!  The roti was perfect, the goat was tender.  We were very happy with the food, and the service was excellent.  The owner is a very easy going and friendly.  He made us feel like family!   If you are in the mood for food with some real flavor, I highly recommend Aneals!!"}
{"text":"This is an easy review to write! Aneal's is an amazing Caribbean restaurant and the food is superb! The restaurant is also incredibly clean and we love stopping by at least once a week for an awesome experience! The weekly specials are phenomenal. We highly recommend this place because you can't go wrong with whatever you order. One reviewer gave this place one star, but it is clearly evident that they reviewed the wrong restaurant!! Aneal's isn't open on Sunday, so if somebody had a bad experience at a Caribbean restaurant in Richmond Hill on Sunday, it wasn't at this location. Aneal is an incredible host and I can't say enough good things about him!"}
{"text":"Was in the area after a doc appt and was happy to discover a 'jerk' restaurant in the Hill.   There's all the standard fare that you'd expect from a 'jerk' house but on Saturdays they serve Shark and Bake (when fresh shark is available). Yum!  Anyways being a weekday I had the jerk chicken for lunch. It's nice that they offer both a small and regular order.  The small is a perfect size for lunch.   I've tried a lot of jerk places in the city and I have to say Aneal's is one of the best. Chicken is moist and flavourful. Rice and beans are also top notch. You could see and taste an abundance of fresh herbs and spices used in the food.  Establishment clean, service friendly. There are also a few proper tables where you can eat in a relaxed atmosphere.   All in all a nice surprise to the standard 'chain' fare you normally find in the Hill. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a light lunch and ordered the large stew oxtail to share (as suggested by the person behind the counter). Man, it was so good. The meat was so tender and juicy with lots of flavour. The rice was cooked to a perfect texture with great flavour as well! The coleslaw helped relieve the spicyness a bit. We got it with mild spice and it still had a kick but it was too good to stop eating! The manager also treated us so well by offering us a cupcake and bottle of hot sauce as a Christmas present. The restaurant looks newly renovated and has a nice atmosphere. But the highlight is definitely the food :) we would come back again and definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ok so if you're in RH you know it's hard to find good carribean food. This place is good! Our oxtail was plentiful, soft, and the gravy was well done and not watery! Jerk chicken was juicy and tasty too. Definitely glad we tried this place out and will be back soon. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time, umpteenth time for my hubby to this delightful treasure in Richmond Hill.    We tried the shark and bake today and it is so good!  A little spicy for me but it's the best I've tasted, much better than the ones you can find @ Maracas Beach in Trinidad!  Generous filling and not greasy at all.  Highly recommended!  And by the way, we bought more food to take home for 2nd round! :)"}
{"text":"When you have a kravin' for a tasty roti wrap- this is truly a great choice. We swing by while in the area and decided between Harvey's and Aneal's, and guess which won? Having eaten here before, we have come to know what to expect from this lovely small business, good food, hole.made, with love and respect to the recipies of the Carribean, while not an expert, I  grew up with a love of the pairing of curried chicken, goat and chickpea stewed in a spicy sauce, all neatly contained in a freshly made roti.   You know it's always a good sign when the owner greets you and advised that it will be a 15 minute wait for your wrap. He is likely testing whether you'll hit the road from impatience, or respect the freshness of a made to order roti almost bursting from the chock full of deliciousness hidden inside. Forget calories and carbs for a few seconds and enjoy!"}
{"text":"solid authentic food, clean and very nice owner! splendid! We need more local gems like this!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were both working from home today and were feeling adventurous for lunch. I did a quick Yelp search and found this restaurant in the area and decided to give it a try based on other Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The menu was a good mix of food that we recognized (chicken, beef, curry, roti etc) with some other menu items we never saw before (shark sandwich?).  We ordered the large curry chicken and jerk chicken and were not disappointed.  The portions were very generous and tasty. The rice had beans inside of it, and was topped off with a bit of the sauce from our dish selection. So the curry chicken dinner, the rice had some curry flavoring to it, and the jerk chicken rice was flavored with jerk chicken. Nice little touch to really make the dish flavor stand out.  Each was served with a small side salad.  The curry and jerk chicken were excellent. The food was piping hot when it came out, and packed a lot of heat.  I dislike places where the \"spicy\" flavors are either heavily vinigered (think Tabasco or Frank's hot sauce), or are just packed with chili's where it burns my lips and mouth long after the meal is over.  The spiciness is tolerable at first with the food served here and then builds up. The faster you eat the hotter it gets! But if you slow down and sip water, the heat mellows out again to a tolerable level. If you pace yourself you can keep a certain level of spiciness going.  Its a bit tough to describe, but if you want heat, the food here brings it to you!  Will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Best curry fish we've ever had!  We came here looking for good caribbean food and we were not disappointed.  Jerk chicken, curry chicken, and the ox tail was so soft and yummy.  They were a bit on the spicy side but if you're looking for authentic food this is the place to be!  Can't wait to try out the other dishes."}
{"text":"Love having a local Trinidadian place in Richmond hill ! Roti is delicious and fresh and Aneal is sweet and charming to all his guests"}
{"text":"Hands down, Aneal's not only makes the tastiest food, the restaurant is also run by amazing people. We visit there almost biweekly for the last few years to get our fix and the food never fails to please. We normally get the jerk chicken and rice - chicken is juicy and packed with flavour. We went to Jamaica last year and it made us miss the food from here!   Shark n' Bake is one of a kind with delicious freshly made bread and the best coleslaw we've ever had!  Beware of their hot sauce, it is full of flavour but man, it is spicy! Aneal makes it fresh in-house and even bottles them to take home.   Would recommend over and over again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken. Coleslaw is great too. The owner Aneal is friendly and gives out cupcakes form his neighbor a bakery. The only place to go for Caribbean food north of Toronto."}
{"text":"Was on the way home from work and needed to pick up some good eats for the fam, but wanted to try something different.  Was feeling for something with a kick and decided on Caribbean food.  Drove by this place a few times so I decided to give it a try.  No real parking for the place so you gotta street park or there is a parking lot across the street.  The actual decor of the place isn't anything special, but at least there's the option to dine-in.    I ended up ordering take out for jerk chicken, curry mutton and ox tail large dishes.  The gentleman behind the counter was pleasant and quickly went into the back to retrieve my order.    My fam and I devoured the food because we were starving to say the least, but overall, the ox tail and mutton were delicious!  I was even impressed with the rice and peas.  Normally, at some places the rice is dry, but it was tasty and well seasoned.  I wasn't impressed with the coleslaw it came with.  There's really no point to it and it wasn't very good.  I'd rather have more rice and peas than the coleslaw.  Overall, I would recommend trying it out.  I can confidently say I'd go back when I'm feeling a little spicy :)"}
{"text":"Terrible. You go there and it's closed or the menu is limited or only available on the weekend? Tried this place a couple of times I didn't find the jerk or the roti tasty at all. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicken curry wrap and it was absolutely disgusting. It literally tasted like there was sand inside."}
{"text":"First time customer. I'm always on the lookout for awesome take out chicken. Explored many restaurants over the years but this one unassuming restaurant in Richmond Hill suddenly ranks at the top of my list. We ordered 3 large jerk chicken dinners. The flavorable home made hot sauce combined with a large portion of perfectly spiced tender chicken accompied with a large dish of spiced rice and beans delivers a combination of flavours unique to the gta. As an added bonus the service was quick, affordable and friendly! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Cold rainy November night in Richmond Hill, time for some hot Caribbean food to warm things up. Headed over to Aneal's for some take out, fast courteous counter service by Aneal himself. I ordered one large oxtail dinner, extra spicy, one oxtail soup, and 3 beef patties. My order was ready in approximately seven minutes, the food smells great, spicy with a slight hint of hot pepper escaping from the container. The oxtail dinner portion size was good, spice level was hot 'as ordered'. Excellent taste with good amount of oxtail on a bed of rice and peas. The oxtail soup consisted of large pieces of oxtail, potato, carrot, cilantro etc. all in a lightly spicy broth. The beef patties were nice and flaky. Aneal's is the spot for true authentic Caribbean food, you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of my go-to spots for some great comfort food.  Being of Caribbean decent, I'm a bit picky when it comes to the food, but this place is 100% authentic and tasty!  Not only is the food great, but Anneal himself is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  Highly recommend if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Was in the Richmond Hill area, noticed this place and thought I'd give it a try for lunch.  Cosy little place to sit down for lunch, I took out as I was in a hurry.  Person behind the counter was very pleasant and the food was excellent.  Peas and rice were not oily or overly dry, not too much coconut milk - dusted with a spice - not overpowering and added a lot to the taste.  The goat was tender, the spicing was milder than some places I have been to but all in all, very tasty and excellent customer service.  Place was clean, tasted clean - I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if i came here on an off-night. The reviews seem to be very different from what I experienced. Overall ,the owner is a great guy. The place was busy when i went and so business must be good. Which is why my experience really surprised me.    I ordered takeout for four. The issue was most of the food was dry and tough, and the quantities were terrible. For example, we opened up one of the chicken rotis and counted two pieces of chicken in the entire roti. The curry goat on rice situation was similar.  Two of the four eating got sick after.   I suspect i went at a time when they were probably running out of food, the food might have been sitting out, or they were busier than they expected (I went in at 7.30 pm on Sunday).   Moral of my story - i might give this place a second try, but definitely not from Thursday to Sunday."}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken, very moist and tender. Sauce is flavourful yet not too spicy. The place looks pretty clean too."}
{"text":"The best Caribbean food around!! So tasty, fresh and the portions are good. They have specials every weekend. The mac and cheese is to die for. Highly recommend you try out this place asap!!"}
{"text":"Aneal's is a great little carribean joint in richmond hill though i prefer the takeaway option compared to eat in (only because there is a lot of static on the sound system and wasn't pleasing to my ears). I've tried both the curry chicken and jerk chicken and I much prefer the jerk flavours but it is also wayyyy too spicy for me!!!   TIP #1: Make sure you bring water with you if you are planning on eating in and not buying a drink.   The portion sizes of the takeaway container compared to the dine-in plate are relatively the same. I got a small and it actually comes in the large styrofoam containers.   TIP #2: Talk to Aneal if you have any food restrictions/preferences. He'll try to accommodate you as best as he can. He even gave me a freshly baked cupcake on the house!"}
{"text":"My wife, and all our friends never tire of this place! Every meal is delicious. Aneal is always very friendly and entertaining. The service is outstanding. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"the moment you walk into, or even call into, aneal's, it's as if you've entered another world--a delicious one, where the people care about you. aneal is a friendly, sweet man, and, man, does he know how to cook. the vegetable roti (filled with a delicious combination of spinach, pumpkin, chickpea and potato) and boneless curry chicken plate (comes with yummy rice and coleslaw) are HEAVENLY. my wife and i have been ordering twice a week and the tasty, healthful food always satisfies. give this local treasure a try. the takeout makes life after work (and with the kids) easy and delicious. 5 stars."}
{"text":"3.5   Passed by this corner on Yonge st and decided to venture in. The restaurant has a clean, contemporary appearance. Upon entering I was greeted by the restaurant staff right away.   After looking at the menu, I decide on a veggie roti, made with potatoes and chick peas inside a tightly wrapped roti (a.k.a shells). Everything is made fresh upon order, which takes about 15-20 minutes if you don't call in ahead. The wait was made short by customers and staff chatting with you.   I wanted to try something called \"doubles\" as well, and these sell out very fast earlier in the day. They had one \"shell\" left and I ate that as my veggie roti was being prepared. It was spicy and a bit sloppy when eating it, but it was quite good.   Next came the veggie roti, this was much easier to eat. Great flavours and very authentic! In all a solid choice for your next meal."}
{"text":"I ordered food to pick up and it was ready very quickly which was convenient. The owner was extremely friendly and pleasant. I ordered the oxtail for myself and my BF and a friend had the jerk chicken and curry roti. The food was great! Exactly how described. Being Jamaican and used to eating Caribbean foods I'm a hard critic but I can say I'm definitely ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.    Aneal is welcoming, friendly and has a passion for food and his customers.   Healthy, vibrant food that has amazing flavour.  Clean and cozy seating area.  Great prices.  If you are anywhere nearby, do yourself a favour and stop in.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Officially one of my favorite places. Chicken is moist and falls off the bone, lots of flavor and good spice. The jerk chicken and chicken roti are must tries. Also very good service. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food. I am originally from Trinidad and it's always disappointing going into a Caribbean restaurant and finding a Canadian version of local food. However, the food here is superb and is completely, deliciously authentic. I am so excited to know that I can find great Caribbean food in Richmond Hill. It's been long awaited!"}
{"text":"Only been once, but no exaggeration it's the best west indian food I've had in some time in the GTA! Unfortunately they are not allowed to serve shark and bake anymore due to a city counselor's request. What a shame. So never got to try theirs. Their hot sauce is also divine."}
{"text":"You order at counter and staff bring the food to your table. Okay, so it's not the most upscale restaurant in town, but the dinning experience is top notch.  They took the time to explain about their sauces - all of which are made in house. Owner walked around to all the tables to chat with customers. These guys truly enjoy what they do here and it shows. There was a constant flow of take out traffic - obviously regulars since the owner seem to know most by name.    I typically try to get authentic jerk chicken in Caribbean neighbourhoods  (oakwood/ eglinton, jane/finch, jane/lawrence).  I can honestly say that this place is about as good as it gets.  Very good jerk chicken and curry chicken.  If you are looking for a non-pretentious place to get great Caribbean food, served by honest and sincere people - this is it. Definitely my new Caribbean food place going forward."}
{"text":"Anytime I can find a Carribean joint to enjoy the island love for good soul food, I don't pass the opportunity.   I've been to many of the Toronto restaurants, and with an unbiased view - I will tell you the food at Aneal was delicious.  Generally when you order rice in restaurants, the flavour of the spices don't seep into the rice grains. The rice and peas of a year was spot-on and flavourful.  Did goats was very tender and just melts in your mouth. I ordered it spicy and it was bearable but yes it did have a nice flavor of enjoyable spiciness.  The coleslaw salad had a mix of sweet and slight lemon teng.  The owner as welcoming and recipient of two Toronto awards, one of which for best Caribbean restaurant.  Yes I will definitely go back, and recommend.  4/5 : I would have liked to see a little bit more on the plate, for a large order."}
{"text":"Nothing on the menu warned us with 1 chili, 2 chilies, etc., yet we got the hint from the board: Caribbean, West Indian, Island food.  We ordered the food as was, and didn't ask for spice level alternation.  The food was spicy and delicious.  The spiciness was mellow at the first bite.  It added up from there.  It became too spicy for me 2/3 of the way.  I could taste the food before I got there though.  There was a complex mix of flavours: rich, bold, a variety of spices.  The chicken and goat was tender.  The marinating spices sipped deep inside the meat.  Yum yum.  The portion was generous.  Rice and bean tasted interesting.    I can't eat too spicy.  On my scale, the spiciness level is medium-high level.  A guy on the next table asked for extra chilli on the side, so I took that you could ask for super spicy.    The only complaint is the slow services.  I don't mind the divey interior at all.  If you order take out (and it seems a lot of people do), factor in extra wait time."}
{"text":"This place is just great, period. The food tastes great and the portions are exactly as I would expect. The price is right for what you're getting and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  I got a jerk chicken roti and my friend got a veggie roti with lots of spinach. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and would definitely return."}
{"text":"When do you ever see a good Caribbean restaurant in Richmondhill? Stop searching cause this place is not only comforting and welcoming but the food is incredible, i love the food and don't have any complaints, it's always fresh and comes fairly quick"}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing place to eat.  Authentic West Indian cuisine...food made with love. The owner, Aneal, is so friendly.  While I waited for my meal to arrive, he greeted every customer as if they were family. The food arrived piping hot...both temperature and deliciously spicy.  This may be the only West Indian restaurant in the immediate area, but well worth the trip even if you're not from Richmond Hill. So far, my wife and I have tried: Chicken roti, shrimp roti, catfish, oxtail, jerk chicken, and doubles. I can honestly say, everything has tasted magnificent.  Full of delicious flavour, ample serving size, comfortable dine-in, and customer service that other places could take a lesson from. Without a doubt, highly recommended!  Give this place a visit...you will love it if you enjoy great food!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty nondescript inside.  A small cafeteria like counter, with small tables covered in plastic.  To complete the cafeteria type experience, food served on small plastic picnic plates with standard plastic cutlery.  Once can say that we eat food, not cutlery and ambiance and I will agree as long as the food is beyond WOW!  Well...it wasn't WOW...more like Pretty Good.  The jerk chicken was seasoned well and the chicken itself was too fall off the bone for my taste.  Kind of a little overcooked but the spice delivered!  Kind of delivered all evening too - might not be the best for those who can not take the heat.  The Chicken Roti was also pretty good.  Nice serving of chicken and potatoes with their curry.  Ask for a cup more of their curry if you are staying and and pour it all over or use as a dip.  It will help with the layers of the roti wrap that can make the meal a little dry.  With limited parking on Yonge Street and the nearby free Green P parking used by the Performing Arts building, it's a bit tough to get to the restaurant before 7PM - no parking on Yonge until then.  Behind the building, there is a couple of spots if you are lucky.  If you want island foods in Richmond Hill, it's slim pickings.  Aneal's is a nice addition to the place.  A solid 3.5 stars for me.  Cheers."}
