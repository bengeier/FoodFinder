{"text":"Like others have said, this is definitely a Asian Chipotle.  Same setup.  You go in and create your meal.  I have to give them one thing, there are lots of choices.  I had a noodle wrap with chicken.  It was ok.  I think one of the problems is that their food is a little dry.  If you go there, make sure you add extra sauce.  All in all, the flavor of the food is just average, kind of bland.  I expected a little better.  My wife had a bowl with noodles and chicken and didn't like it.  We also had the Yaki's which are their deep fried wontons.  They looked great but tasted average.  I really wanted to like this place, but to be honest, I don't think we will be going back there.  The staff there is friendly and they gave us a rundown of how things work when I told them it was our first visit."}
{"text":"Super delicious bowls! Very affordable! I recommend the Mashi chicken. Korean beef is also good."}
{"text":"I keep going back here for lunch.  I must go every week or two anymore.  I get the same thing every time and every time I like it.  It's not gourmet, as Andrew W points out, but as a go-to quick lunch spot I'll take it!  Beats McDonald's or Burger King 8 days a week!"}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind place!  I switch it up between the wrap and the bowl.  The quality of food is outstanding and there are so many possible combinations, you could eat here everyday and get something different each time.  The bok choi and kim chi are both tasty and fresh.  The cilantro-chile sauce is a must, reminds me of a yum yum sauce with a little kick.  I just hope they decide to open another location near me because I drive about 40 min to eat here.  Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and the friendly girl behind the counter explained how it all worked and let us sample the meats ! The Korean beef was very tender!! The sauces are really good too! We got a couple on the side! Everything was very fresh and tasty! Te staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Like Chipolte but Asian food.  You build your order in front of you. Great selection of sauces as well. Bowls are microwaveable so great for taking leftovers to work the next day"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  So many different combinations, and they are great.  Staff is super too.  You must visit."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Asian fusion then Mashiso is perfect for you. This Korean inspired Chipotle is quite interesting with the choices of starches, meats and veggies. I am a truly a fan."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome. Great price points, delicious food, friendly service and the wraps are huge.  Truly huge!"}
{"text":"This place had been open for awhile before I'd ever stepped foot inside. After receiving several recommendations to try it, I finally gave it a whirl. Woe is  me for not trying it sooner! It's similar to chipotle in the sense that you can order a wrap, bowl, or salad. You also have the options to choose rice or noodles, several different meats and veggies, and warm and cold sauces. I really enjoy the Thai curry chicken they make, it's fantastic! The staff is very friendly, as is the owner who's there quite often. I live about twenty five minutes from Mashiso but that doesn't stop me going there at least once a week. I actually prefer this restaurant over Chipotle! The food portions are perfect, always leaving me with a full belly. I recommend this place to everyone. Even my toddler devours it, they sell mini bowls which are perfect for him! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Conclusion: Folks, this isn't gourmet food, but for $13 for 2 people, in and out within a few minutes?  Yeah, I'll definitely be back for more!  Stopped by Mashiso last night with my lady friend.  It was the first time we noticed the place (they've been there since March 2011, we were told).  We both ordered bowls - I got fried rice with thai chicken curry, grilled bok choy, sweet and tangy sauce, and just a little bit of the cilantro chili mayo on top.  The bowl is plenty of food - probably way too much for such a late hour, but on a workday I imagine it would be perfect for a good lunch portion with some left over for a 3:00 crash snack.  I really enjoyed my meal, and so did the LF.  I've really no idea whether Mashiso could be considered authentic (I strongly suspect not), but that really didn't matter to me.  The fried rice was tasty, and was a great complement to the chicken, which had a nice kick to it and was very juicy.  I really enjoyed the bok choy, but that was my first time eating bok choy so my opinion is suspect in that case.  The sauce and mayo finished out the meal nicely.    Atmosphere: Acceptable for a lunch place.  I hate to say it, but I would echo the other sentiments here that Mashiso is really like Chipotle but with Asian food.  I happen to love Chipotle though, so this is just fine by me!  By the time we showed up, we were the only ones left in the place.  The two guys behind the counter were very helpful in explaining the choices and offered suggestions where appropriate."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Cool concept a la Asian Chipotle and the food was very fresh and well cooked... Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place was good for the price! For 6 to 7 dollars for a bowl, wrap, or roll. The yakis are great!  LOVE THE KIMCHI! My only complaint is no tofu... that was the only thing I was going that they had and sadly they didn't. The honey lemon and ginseng tea is awesome. This is a five star place for service and for the price of the food for what you get!  Overall happy with my experience and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wayyyy to salty. Their meat is actually decent but everything else is awful, the rice, the noodles where do I even start, nothing is right, it's a place where white people try to make \"Asian fusion\" food, if u r my fellow Asian friends, stay away and save yourself from a horribly salty meal."}
{"text":"Mashiso... I like you.  This was my very first time at this restaurant & I have to say, I really enjoyed it! It's nothing fancy but for a quick bite at a good price, I'm all for it!  It has almost the same exact set-up as a chipotle, right down to the type of choices you have. The great part is you have many more options! You can choose from a wrap, roll, bowl, salad---3 types of rice or noodles---vegetarian, 2 types of chicken, pork, beef---3 types of sauces---3 types of special mayo---& 4 vegetable sides. They also have a few \"snack\" side options you can choose from as well!  I chose a bowl with fried rice, all 3 veggie toppings, with the sweet & tangy sauce. I have to say, I wasn't super impressed with the grilled bok choy, but everything else was REALLY, really good. The rice had great flavor, the Asian slaw & fresh kimchi gave it a fresh, sweet taste (not an overwhelming amount of sauce, might I add), & the sauce gave a nice added flavor & texture!   The service was friendly & quick. They told me if I have any questions about the ingredients or spiciness to just ask.   The prices are between $6-$7, depending if you get the beef (most expensive) or vegetarian along with added price with drinks.  The atmosphere was nice, the place was clean, & the lunch was great! I would definitely go back & try a new combo!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch choice. I love the different flavors, and some of their Thai inspired food is delicious. While it may not be the easiest to get to from the main road, it's worth winding your way around to find a parking spot and the entrance."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else has mentioned this place is essentially an Asian version of 'Chipotle'.   I had a Lo Mein bowl with the Thai curry chicken with pepper sauce and it was spicy enough for me without being overpowering. My girlfriend ordered a bowl as well with the Kalbi beef and rice, with Hunan sauce and she really enjoyed it as well.  We also had an order of the Yakis which is an order of 5 deep fried wontons, and we're made fresh to order so they came out nice and crispy.   When we're in the area and in the mood for some Asian fare, it'll be a definite consideration!"}
{"text":"Literal best. Everyone needs to go. Every aspect of the food from rice to lettuce from their Asian slaw to sauces is amazing. I hope they are super successful and I will continue to go. Customer service is always great, they have a great staff!!"}
{"text":"This place has never let me down. I have been going numerous times a week for years and have never had bad food or service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time we kind of experimented. The second time, my daughter and I knew a little more and made some better choices. Love the chicken and Korean beef. We prefer the warm sauces over the cold. Also we like the fried rice as the base over the noodles.   We haven't found our perfect order but we will be back as repeat customers. I'm highly sensitive to MSG and I've never had an issue here. I think this is a refreshing change of pace from burgers, pizzas, sub sandwiches, etc.  It feels like it's a healthier option.   Both times I've visited, the Coke at the fountain has been just brown water. The Dr. Pepper was ok and I did try the different iced teas on our first visit.  Honestly, that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It took a lil while to perfect my bowl but have finally come up with the best combination. First I have to say the quality of their food is really good. Sticky rice and Kalbi beef is not cheap but the quality of either one is not sacrificed. Also, adding the different kinds of mayo to anything really puts a different flavor in the bowl. Id say the only thing I would change is to make it more authentic. The Kimchi is really mild compared to what Koreans make theirs. I love the extra heat and always add jalape√±os."}
{"text":"It's essentially Asian Chipotle. You can get a bowl (rice or noodles) or a wrap, your choice of meat, your choice of sauce, and a side. I've eaten here twice just getting something fast and easy on the way back to the hotel to do some work, and the best I can give it is 3 stars. The Korean beef is pretty good, but the noodles are doughy and the sides marginal. The kimchi is actually quite bad as it is just chopped up cabbage bathed in garlic pepper sauce - not the least bit authentic. If you are looking for something different that is fast and easy, this place isn't a bad choice. If you are looking for authentic Asian food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  My wife and I stopped in a whim and we were impressed.  The staff took their time to explain every meat, sauce and dressing.  The food was delicious!  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Had no idea what type of restaurant this was when we walked in.  I knew it was Asian cuisine but that was the extent of it.  We ended up staying and were pleasantly surprised at the meal we had.    As with all of the other comments, this is very similar to Chipotle.  You have a choice of a wrap, bowl and a few other choices.  We both had chicken bowls each seasoned differently but very good.  The kid who worked the counter did an excellent job describing each item and gave suggestions on how to \"build\" or meal.  After putting it all together I would do a few things differently but overall both meals were really good.  Fresh ingredients and good taste.    It's not overly expensive and a great item for a take-out on any given night.  It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Visited Mashiso for the first time today. It was interesting in that it plays off the fast casual style of Chipotle, but with Asian-inspired ingredients. You first choose a bowl or wrap, followed by meat (beef, pork, or two different marinated chickens), then noodles or rice, and an array of warm and cold sauces, and various veggie toppings to finish it off. I chose the ginger and soy marinated chicken with noodles and Hunan sauce, followed by Bok Choy, and a handful of veggies. My husband ordered pork, noodles, the pepper sauce (their spiciest option) and a number of veggies as well. While the food was clean and edible, we honestly weren't crazy about the sauces or flavors (or lack thereof). There wasn't anything 'wrong' with the food, but perhaps it just comes down to individual taste. My husband said he was surprised that there didn't seem to be any more than a 1 out of 10 spice kick to his dish, which was supposedly the spiciest thing on the menu. I'm not sure what it was with the Hunan sauce, but there were some jarring flavors going on with it. We've been searching this area high and low for a solid East Asian option that doesn't break the bank, and unfortunately this didn't do it for us. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best place ever, either-just a middle of the road. The place overall was clean, staff was friendly, and there was a good choice of foods to suit various dietary needs."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and since I was in the area I was very excited to stop in.  Wow I was disappointed. When I arrived there was a few tables taken up, but pretty slow for a lunch rush. The guy on the line was very knowledgeable and explained what each item was (heat wise). There were to other ppl behind the line prepping food  The girl by the fryer had the SHORTEST cutoff shorts I have ever seen in the work place..  The food was bad. Like bad Chinese food wrapped in a burrito. The pork wasn't as spicy as the guy hinted and was very cheap tasting with most of it being pure fat, full of gristle.   I will not be returning and this is very sad bc I really loved this place."}
{"text":"This place should be everywhere.  Food is great and quick, easy.   Awesome food, best idea.  Love it"}
{"text":"Ever wanted quick, healthy and simple, with an Asian flair?  Look no further than Mashisho! The place is set up like many other establishments with the current trend of \"assemble and go\" structure. You can have your delicacy in a bowl or a wrap, you can have vegetarian or meaty, all according to your preference.   Mashiso is located near lots of shopping and shares a large parking lot. They're good for a quick, healthy bit when you want and are decently priced.   So, if you're feeling hungry, go to Mashiso, and \"wrap\" it up!"}
{"text":"Foshizo, Mashiso is the best Asian grille around!! Their flavors here are seriously addictive.   It's the Asian version of Chipotle.. fast/casual, with wrap / bowl / salad options.  Great meats and different quality veggies you don't get every day.  Plus nice large variety of sauces n dressings (Hunan & Sweet Mango are my faves).  After some 10 visits.. never had a bad meal, that's pretty impressive!  It's also nice you don't have to hassle them to load up your bowl.. they always pile it on!  June '18,  their Mashi Chicken is awesome. All the veggies taste great. Still never had a mediocre bowl!"}
{"text":"My fiance loved this place. I did not. The concept is cool, but the product is just underwhelming.  I hate to call it an Asian Chipotle like the two previous reviews, but that is really the best way to describe it. I ordered a bowl with noodles, chicken and asian slaw.  Nothing too special.  My fiance had a wrap with the beef and I agreed it was much tastier.  We also split an order of their wontons and I was not impressed.  They lacked flavor and when we bit into them tons of oil came squirting out.   I know its a new restaurant and they are probably still working out some of their kinks, but I still think I'll put this one on my do not try again list."}
{"text":"I went here twice. The first time with my boyfriend and the second time with a friend of mine. I was impressed both times. Like everyone says it is exactly like an asian Chipotle. Just with more choices.   You walk in and you have the same boards set up like Chipotle but you can choose from a bowl, burrito, roll, salad or I believe one more thing...... Then you choice from your choice of Kobe Beef, two different kinds of chicken, Pork or Vegetarian. Then you have three sauces you can choose from. Sweet and Tangy, Hunan or one more...... Then you also have a choice between white rice, fried rice, noodles and a couple more things. Then you choose veggies Asian slaw, Kimchi, or Bok choy. All in all it is really good and decently priced.   The only thing that is a downfall is their little dumpling like things are kinda of lower quality compared to there other things and if you get a sauce AND a mayo it can be kinda of an overpowering flavor. I suggest getting the mayo on the side....."}
{"text":"Incredibly salty and just a lot of things going on in one bowl. The noodles, beef, Bok Choi, and Asian slaw already all have their own respective seasoning but then I took the advice to add another sauce on top of it all. Didn't mesh well and wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of Mashiso.    When you walk in and see the boards above the counter with the menu options the very first thing that comes to mind is Chipolte, but as the items suggest it's with Asian food instead of Mexican.  And, for what you're getting it's not too bad, but there's definitely room for improvement.  Your fist decision in on the vessel your food will be served in:  A bowl, a wrap, a bun (hoagie bun-ish), or a salad.  From there you choose from sticky rice, fried rice, brown rice, or a lo mein type noodle.  Meat options include beef, pork, chicken, and there's also a vegetarian option.  You can then finish off your order with grilled bok choy, kimchi, or an Asian slaw.  Sauces available are a pepper sauce, a Hunan sauce, and a few different types of mayo.  I had ordered the mushi pork and attempted to create a quasi-banh mi sandwich (sans the pate).  The fixings for the sandwich were all really tasty, but the bun ended up getting soggy and fell apart on me.  Completely my fault for making the request, and I realize that.  Soggy bun aside, I really did like their kimchi, and the pork was very flavorful.  My friend had ordered a bowl with the mushi chicken, and she also liked the flavoring of her meal.  She got half noodle, and half fried rice.  She said that the next order she would just get the fried rice as the noodles didn't really add anything special to her meal.  The owner had also brought out some of their Yakis - which are a fried wontons filled with chicken, spinach, carrot, and noodles.  They fried to a nice crunch, but the filling had little to no taste.  I thought it was remarkably bland when compared to the rest of their food.    Thankfully, Mashimo has bottles of Sriracha (Red Rooster Sauce) out on their counters like Chipolte has bottles of Tobasco, and what doesn't taste better with sriracha sauce on it?  While the concept and formula is, by my account, a retread of the Chipolte model I do appreciate the idea of having a different option available.    For a fast, cheap, and convenient Asian inspired menu that is offered by Mashiso it's good to see that they are making things fresh, and not just deep frying prepared/frozen food like most every suburban Chinese food joints people run to for an Asian fix."}
{"text":"This is an Asian version of Chipotle. Pick your style (wrap, bowl, salad), rice, if desired, protein, and toppings and sauces.   The flavors are incredible, and the quality is excellent. Get yourself a side of yakis. (Stuffed, deep fried wonton wrappers.) Yum!  I wish they would open one of these around Mayfield, so I could go at lunch.   The restaurant is clean, and the staff is friendly. My only complaint is I wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Good fusion. The food was super fresh. The workers were very nice. Really enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant since they first open. Love the fresh simple food with excellent seasonings and sauces. Portions are generous and prices reasonable ..... Just wish they delivered.,,,,"}
{"text":"What was five star was the service. We hadn't been here before so it took a minute to look over the options. Then the guy behind the counter was very helpful explaining what was in everything and what our options were. There was also a guy who came around twice while we were eating to be sure we didn't need anything. But the food was just alright. I would go again and try something different though."}
{"text":"Really good stuff. It is indeed the Asian Chipotle. I had the noodle bowl with chicken. Nice heat. The fried wontons are yummy as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  After reading the reviews, I took my team to Mashiso for a pregame meal.  Wow, Great service and great food.  Having a team of 20 players each with their own idea of good food makes picking the idea meal tough if not impossible.  After we started eating, instant gram blew up.  Every athlete had great things to say.  I would give them 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I have been coming here at least once a week for carryout for almost a year now. The food is all really good (definitely try the yakis) and the staff is fantastic. Their online ordering system is also really good and quick, so the convenience is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome food, chipotle meets Asian. I really hope they open up one of these on the east side soon. Staff and food were amazing."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!  I end up eating here almost every single time I am in the North Olmsted area, and half the time I'm making the drive just to eat here.  I get a flour wrap with white rice, mashi chicken, half sweet-and-tangy/half pepper sauce, steamed broccoli, carrots, cucumbers, jalape√±os, and their wonderful cilantro chili mayo.  It always has the perfect amount of spiciness without being overwhelming.  The staff are always helpful if you have questions about sauces or other ingredients and never act annoyed when a customer walks in.  I honestly have no idea what people don't like about this place.  I have never had a bad experience, and I will continue to here all the time."}
{"text":"It is not Korean food but fusion Asian food. Korean bbq was a bit tough to chew. I have no idea why it is Korean BBQ.   . kimchi is also a bit different from original taste. Anyway, it is worth going for cheap price."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and both times found the staff beyond helpful, offering suggestions when I was stuck and generally very upbeat.  I walked in at an off time and was only one in the place and never heard any staff chit chat putting down workplace, I found that refreshing.  I hate when you are in a shop and staff is standing around complaining about there situation in front of me....so thought this was a good sign.  The food is fresh and the concept awesome, I love the kimchi (? spelling) with cold cucumber was nice combo of spice and cool that could be addictive.  Had the chicken, noodles, Sweet/Hot sauce, bok choy, kimchi, and cucumber, second visit and not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food....really. It's great! The rest is below.   I hope the owner sees this!! This is one of my fav local spots.  Stopped in today to order a bowl and the girl working the counter was incredibly rude.  (She didn't have a name tag so I don't know what her name is, but she's the 'mod/goth style' girl with gauge earrings and dark hair.). I've never had a problem with one of your people before but she isn't someone who should be providing customer service to guests.  She acted annoyed that I was there, annoyed that the cook hadn't refilled her bok choy, interrupted me mid sentence to move my arm back (I was pointing to the sign reading sauces).  I understand if customers aren't allowed to cross the glass threshold with a body part for sanitary reasons but for petes sake!! I wasn't doing it on purpose and barely had my hand over the glass.  She's rude and a disservice to your business.  I'm not a complainer...look at my other yelp reviews.  If she's here next time I visit, I'll bring my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Like everyone has already said, the concept hits you in the face the second you walk in the door:  This is Chipotle with Asian food.  I went with a Mashi Chicken (flour) wrap with half fried rice and half noodles (got that idea from Dan S.'s review), hunan sauce, grilled bok choy, and cilantro-chili mayo ($6.50).  And...it was pretty decent.  The marinated Mashi Chicken was pretty good with a little bit of pepper added to familiar tastes of ginger and soy sauce.  The fried rice wasn't anything special, but I did like the noodles (which are tossed with carrots, green onion, soy sauce, and sesame).  The noodles were a bit on the oily side though, which I think led to my burrit...err, wrap falling apart pretty quickly.  I might try a 3/4th rice, 1/4 noodle combination next time.  The hunan sauce and cilantro-chili mayo were alright, but I really didn't get enough of the grilled boy choy (the wrap was pretty full already) for it to add significantly to the taste.  The dining space is simple, clean, and not crowded--better than the two Chipotles I frequent (Crocker Park and Great Northern).  There's a self-serve pop machine and another machine with a variety of iced teas to pick from.  With a few tweaks to the taste, I think the Mashiso wraps could be quite good.  I wonder if they can work in shrimp, and maybe some Tsingtao beer to match Chipotle's Coronas.  Unfortunately, what they can't tweak is the location.  I only found the place playing with the Yelp app while I was sitting around at the mall.  I'm less confident in the North Olmsted Towne Center concept than I am with the Asian Chipotle concept.  But, now that I know Mashiso is there, I'd be happy to return."}
{"text":"I came to the area this place is thinking I'd get Jimmy John's, but decided last minute to come here instead, and real glad I did. Super tasty, fast service, and damn good food! Think Chipotle, but Asian food. And not like Chipotle's Shophouse Thai food - better than that. Absolutely worth stopping by if you're looking for some quick and good Asian food!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, but this place is incredible!!! People of Cleveland and surrounding areas....GET TO THIS PLACE....NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"It's just good food. Good bok choy and kimchi, great sauce selections and  noodles. My preschooler loves the yakis and my first grader get his own bowl. When I'm not super hungry the minibowl is a perfect option."}
{"text":"No complaints here. The food was good and a nice change of pace in a city awash with chain restaurants. I had the pork bowl with noodles, fried rice, & kimchee. Everything was tasty but the noodles were probably on the line for a while before I got I them. But even after sitting a little too long they were still good."}
{"text":"Overall. Not somewhere I feel comfortable ordering food from ever again!  My husband and I wanted some quick noodles and well this seemed like a good place to try.   Yuck.  The look is all wrong and disgusting. Dark. Gloomy. Funky smell. And the kitchen is just messy. When you order your food it's similar to chipotle style but nothing like its quality.   The workers are sloppy and they are last people on earth I want touching my food. But here I was eating my chicken lo mein.   Yuck!!  It was good at first then I started to feel like I was eating duck feet! The flavor and after taste was horrific.  The veggies looked fresh...the workers were...nice and knowledgable but wow....picking their sweaty face and all that...Calling all health inspectors!!!!!"}
{"text":"Asian chipotle that's not nearly as good as Chipotle. Pork was overly dry noodles lacked any flavor. The only thing that saved dinner was the Yakis. Those were freshly made and delicious! I would come back for those but other than that really nothing special."}
{"text":"Wow, the food was awesome! I am an out of town visitor, but I wish I could eat this food everyday. The staff was very nice to help me decide what sauces to try. Everything was very good."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical upon entering what used to be the old fat burger. I was pleased to see the fresh ingredients the great colors and the clean environment. Everyone in the family ordered something different and all of it was good. They tend to use a lot of rice so if you like more vegetables just ask for less rice. They have 5 differently choices multiple vegetable choices and I would recommend the kimchi"}
{"text":"Overall I want to like this place a lot... but can't quite bring myself to do so.  First the pros:  Overall is a pretty good deal for the amount of money you pay ($6ish - $8ish per person).  I always leave very full, and I can't say I've ever gotten anything that tasted bad.  In fact, most the food tastes alright.  Also, employees always are friendly and knowledgeable.  I like the atmosphere as well.  On the other hand... while it is an ok place to eat, there is nothing about it that really makes me want to eat there.  Food's alright, but many other nearby places just seem to draw me in a lot more often.  I don't think any of the food is particularly amazing, and has a general Americanized Asian taste to it.    If friends want to eat there, I'll gladly go with them and for the most part enjoy my meal.  But after eating there perhaps ten times over the last 2 years or so, I can't recall a time where I had craved it or really told friends or family about how great the place was either.    I'd add to the \"Meh.  I've experienced better\"... \", but still was alright\"."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Mashiso. I go here every week and have never had a bad experience . The staff is very friendly and quick. The food is always fresh. I work at a nearby business and have recommended it to many people. When describing it, I call it an Asian Chipotle. (Only 10 times better!)"}
{"text":"This is a quick service, build your own bowl/wrap style restaurant. As someone who is highly allergic to peanuts it's good to know that this place has no peanut sauces or peanuts in anything! The manger or lender (not sure which) was very friendly and happy to tell me that when I asked. I ordered the non spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and the Hunan sauce as well as an order of the fried chicken & veggie dumplings. My bowl didn't have a ton of flavor but I picked the east spicy/strong flavored options. Next time I will get the sauce that comes with the dumplings on my bowl because it was delicious-sesame, a little spicy, slightly vinegar-y and light.   Over all the prices are very good for the portions and the ingredients could make a good, quick, filling meal. It depends on how you decided to load your bowl, wrap or salad though! The staff was friendly and I'm sure they would be happy to help make a good combination of toppings."}
{"text":"I didn't find it the food very tasty. It was also cold after a 10 min drive home which took away from the flavor too."}
{"text":"Ive always really enjoyed grabbing a bite to eat here, so I thought Id finally write a review! Its nothing fancy. Just really good, fresh ingredients at a reasonable price. I usually get the noodles with beef or mashi chicken, broccoli, lots of slaw, scallions and cilantro. The portions are big and pack lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Only giving 4 stars because the server wasn't very helpful. This was our first time here, and had no idea what to expect with flavors. Server was not very helpful. But, all in all, we were pleasantly surprised. Fresh tasting food, crisp veggies, and flavorful chicken. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh Asian food. We call it Chinese Chipotle. Been a dozen times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"This business serves Asian rice bowls, kind of like the Korean version of Chipotle.  It's a fine place to drop by when cheap but fast is what you're looking for.  Not high cuisine by any standards, but as fast food goes, pretty good-- a nice place to hit for lunch in a hurry."}
{"text":"This 5 star rating is comparing them to restaurants in their same class: fast food, casual, take-out:  it doesn't get any healthier than this for this price!  We are vegan and try to avoid high calorie meals but not sacrifice taste.  Not an easy meal to find at a fast food place! So here I can choose brown rice or salad base and then load on the steamed broccoli, bok choy, kimchi and grated carrots, then top with a small bit of Hunan sauce.  The kimchi already added the heat so you do not need much sauce at all.  And this is $6.50 AND the rice bowl option is enough to feed me twice!!!  Love it!  (Salad won't keep so eat in one sitting)  The interior is very very clean and staff were working quick paced to keep the prep area full.  I love that because everything's coming fresh off the wok/grill, and this was 45 minutes before close on a Saturday night.   It's in a funny location.... I found them on Yelp... You would never stop there from the street if you didn't know where you were going.  But they've been there five years, so obviously the food is good!"}
{"text":"This is an a la carte bowl, wrap, or salad place, similar to that of a Chipotle or Moe's except Korean Asian style.   Service: 5 stars.. I can't rave enough about it. First time here, and they were super helpful by letting us try almost all the different ingredient, meats, and sauce.   Food: 4.5 stars... Not perfect but well above average for to-go food! Unlimited combinations.   Cleanliness: 5 stars. Every table was clean. Works practiced clean when serving.   Healthiness: 3.5- 4.5 stars. Lots of veggies you can add to your bowl but a lot of it is cooked with oil. If you desire, you can make a very healthy bowl or salad.   Price: $6.50-$7.70 per bowl, wrap, or salad. Reasonably priced for the quantity.   If you like Asian style food, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Mashiso, the so-called 'Asian Chipotle' of Cleveland, affords potential caterees a limited menu of build-your-own-bowl options and exceptionally scrumptious sauces. Though their punctuality has, at times, left something to be desired, their product is reliable, and occasionally inspires all manner of exalted taste bud summersaulting. Be apprised that their catered delicacies cool off relatively quickly sans sterno, and the bok choy is ever-so-slightly bland, but the lo mein is expertly seasoned, and the white rice maintains just the right amount of sticky even after undergoing the inevitable microwave reheat. A dire lack of vegetarian proteins mystifies, however-- the catering menu lacking even the most rudimentary of pan fried tofu options, not to mention something more cosmopolitan like good ol' tempeh or seitan. The primarily mayo-based cold sauces more or less make up for this depressing dearth of veggie goodness, however. Try the outstanding sesame or wasabi varieties for savory and/or spicy kicks, respectively. While, in the end, not what one might call a beacon of Asian gourmet, Mashiso is a titan of convenience and the saucy add-ons--the recipes for which, if the website is to be believed, have been passed down for generations--will give your life an extra layer of gustatory meaning."}
{"text":"An Asian spin on the chipotle build-your-own concept with extensive choices all for one affordable price.   Choose from the listed ingredients on the boards. Start with a choice of a Bowl, wrap, roll or salad. Choose you protein from Kobe beef, mild mashi or spicy curry  chicken , mashi pork, or vegetarian choice. Warm sauces include:sweet and tangy, Hunan, teriyaki. Starches include sticky White or fried rice, lo mein noodles. Choose veggies such as warm bok Choy, Kimchi, broccoli and cold additions such as sweet Asian slaw, chopped green onions, carrots, lettuce, etc and choice of cheese. Finally another choice of various tasty add-on sauces from sesame ginger, wasabi , sweet & tangy and various hot sauces to add yourself as needed.   If you are not familiar with all the extensive very tasty sauce choices, I recommend you order them on the side to taste and then add as desired.   Convenient, quick, tasty alternative with good sized portions, good flavor and texture for an economical price.   Service is great and staff welcomes you when you walk in and guides you through all the choices in detail with recommendations depending on your taste preferences.   Clean, Casual, good atmosphere. Recommend. Great concept."}
{"text":"Well, I've been there several times before. The food isn't bad BUT on a recent visit they ran out of broccoli. The place opened at 11am and I visited around 2:45pm....shouldn't they have paid attention to their inventory!?!? So I was told it would be a 10 minute wait...12 minutes in I ask how much longer the brocilli would be and was told, \"it's cooking\". To make matters worse they did not even offer as much as a cup of water as I waited!!!!! Never ever again!!!! I will definitely spread the word about their crappy customer service!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I never stopped here before all these years, since Mashiso is within walking distance of my house!  This place is super fantastic!  What a gem!  It is indeed like an Asian Moe's or Chipotle's, pardon the analogy.  I had a Thai chicken wrap, with lo mein soft noodles, and a whole bunch of toppings to go with.  They also gave me one of their signature sauces, and I proceeded to have one of the best wraps i've ever had the privlege of sinking my chompers into!  The ginger honey ginseng tea was great as well.  Needless to say, the quality food here is very flavorful and healthy, and the marinated chicken was apparently white meat with no fat or gristle whatsoever, unlike many other dissapointing places i've been to lately. Needless to say, Mashiso's is my favorite new place, and I can't wait to try other combinations of meat, sauces, toppings, etc.  Very affordable too."}
{"text":"Very Americanized Korean food but it is still tasty! They are pretty much an \"asian chipotle\" where you decide what you put into your wrap, bowl, or salad. There are many choices including a large variety of tasty sauces!"}
{"text":"Super good. I eat here at least once a week since discover. Great quality, friendly staff, and stellar price to portion ratio."}
{"text":"Not great for vegetarians/vegans. No protein like tofu. Limited veggie choices including way overcooked broccoli. Flavorless sauces. At least it was cheap?"}
{"text":"**[Mashiso is located in the newer shopping plaza near Target - on the end, close to Jimmy Johns.]**  Stopped in for lunch with a friend for my first time here. Enjoyed the food and price/value was good and portion was large. They haven't been open long but word seems to be spreading.  Easy to get concept (explained well by Chris M. here). \"Asian Chipotle\" sums it up (in a good way!).  After talking with the owner (hands-on guy, very helpful), I had him make me a wrap with their Thai Chicken just the way he likes it. Got the Asian Slaw, Cilantro-Garlic Mayo, fresh jalapenos, fresh cilantro and a bit of Srichacha hot sauce.) All great choices! The end result was a $6.50 giant overstuffed burrito I attacked with a fork. About $8 with tax and a drink, not bad. Sure beats fast food or Sakkio in the mall, but faster and less expensive than a real sit down...it's just lunch!  He let us sample some of the sauces (the pepper sauce was a bit underwhelming - a tad spicy but a bit too salty for my taste, but he mentioned that they don't add any salt to the other ingredients, so it would blend however.) The two types of chicken were a bit hard to distinguish but were well cooked (grilled, diced) and had just enough flavor without overpowering the sauce selections.  I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit to try some of their other options!"}
{"text":"Like Chipotle in that your food is assembled in that manner. Unlike in that your food is nowhere near the quality. As my companion stated, \"Meh, it filled the void.\" I found it to be more sauce than substance."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in North Olmsted. The restaurant uses a chipotle style approach where you pick what you want. You can choose from a wrap, a bowl or a salad. I have only ever gotten the bowl. I love putting coleslaw on top of my chicken curry and then adding rice and then and yum yum sauce. The only thing i don't like is that the carrots have a strong organic taste to them that i am not a fan of. It often over powers the rest of the ingredients in the bowl. So i usually pass on that. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ehh...went here last weekend and it was just okay. My bowl was filled with noodles, steak, veggies and sauce. The girl recommended a sauce similar to yum yum sauce. However, the sauce was about 100 times spicier than yum yum sauce. I then tried the sesame mayo which was delicious."}
{"text":"Asian Chipotle with NOODLES!!! So yummy!  I couldnt decide between the bowl or the wrap. Can you??"}
{"text":"Great fusion!!! Flavors galore and way better than chipotle.  There should be more franchises of theses all over."}
{"text":"A friend of mine eats here weekly and wanted me to give the place a try.  I loved it.  Everything was very fresh and the staff was helpful describing different items to me to help me make my choices.  I don't live very close but plan to stop in again the next time I'm in N.O."}
{"text":"So so so sooo so good! I have only been here once but even just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Chipotle style Asian food you can't go wrong. You pick the meet and the ingredients. Then there's the sauces ohhh the sauces. I am a hard core dipper (It's a thing, I'm telling you) so when there's sauce especially many options of sauce I am in heaven. The lady serving us was nice enough to let me try every single one so even better. It's a casual dinning place with plenty of tables. I will be going back forsure."}
{"text":"I lived in North Olmsted for the better part of 3 years and to be honest I have driven past Mashiso (still no idea how to pronounce it) plenty of times not thinking anything of it. My girlfriend brought it up for us to try as she heard that it was similar style to Chipotle but Asian cuisine so we figured we would give it a go for dinner on Saturday night. We pulled up at prime dinner time of 6pm. We walked in and to be honest the first thing I thought was this was a Chipotle clone. The d√©cor was similar (except with red as the main color theme), had a similar line as chipotle and even the same menu style above the line. I love Chipotle so I was completely fine with the set up and felt like I was in my comfort zone. It was also nice to see other diners in there enjoying dinner and not a completely empty restaurant.   We were greeted by the restaurant worker and we stated to her that it was our first time. She was very friendly, explained the process as similar to yet again Chipotle (wrap, bowl, salad) and even offered to let us sample the meats to pick the one for our liking. We both opted for bowls and both went with the vegetable lo mein noodles over the rice, I went with the Thai curry chicken as it has a nice spice to it, the lady went with the Korean beef without trying a sample. We finished our bowls with steamed broccoli and carrots, Asian slaw, Hunan Sauce (soy based) and cheese. They also gave us multiple \"cold sauces\" to mix in which was a nice touch. The food was good not great; it would be better in my opinion if they stirred it all together but that's just a preference. The meats were tasty but I would go with the Korean beef next time as it had better flavor than my chicken dish. The noodles were nothing to write home about but I did surprisingly enjoy the Asian slaw. The meal was portioned correctly as I was able to finish my meal but I was 100% full when I was done. I recommend the orange \"cold sauce\" over the white \"cold sauce\" (didn't get the names of these).   It was overall a nice changeup to Asian cuisine.  I wouldn't say this was any better or any worse than any Chinese takeout but I would come back again. My meal was filling and priced well, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and it was a very clean establishment. If you want to change it up, give Mashiso a go."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and great food and very fresh:) Great Bok Choy and Asian slaw. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"First time here, food was great! Kind of a take off of Chipotle with their style, wraps, bowls or salad. Very tasty meat choices and lots of veggies to choose from. The sauce options are good too, a few warm and a few cold. Very friendly staff.  I will be back, very tasty!"}
{"text":"Think Chipotle, but Asian food. Pick wrap, roll, bowl or salad. Pick rice (white, brown or fried) or noodles. Pick a meat filling (Kalbi beef, mashi pork, mashi chicken, curry chicken) or vegetarian. You can add sauces and a veggie side.  I had a bowl with brown rice, curry chicken and the sweet chili sauce. The food was good, no complaints. I'd go back if I'm in the area and hungry for decent, fast, cheap food."}
{"text":"Mashiso is top notch and I'd give it ten stars if I could! I come here pretty often as it's located close to my workplace and for the quality, healthy food you get for the price it's absolutely unbeatable. I first came here under the words, \"It's like an Asian Chipotle\" and that's accurate. I've gotten the noodles, brown rice, the wrap, the yakis (fried meat and veggie dumplings), and it's all great. My current fixation is getting the salad because it's so freaking dense and delicious! We start with romaine, then Thai Curry chicken, bok choy and broccoli (the AND is a must!), Asian slaw, cucumber, cilantro, green onion, carrot, and fresh jalapeno.   Everything here is so fresh and every time I walk in they are grilling meat! The sauces are great. I don't really get the cold sauces because they're all mayo based and I'm anti, mayo, but the warm sauces are where it's at. I get the pepper sauce and the sweet and tangy. They have three different kinds of great iced tea also; keenly I recommend the ginseng and honey tea or the mango.  I also should point out that the service is outstanding. I'm in and out regardless of how busy they are and the staff is always kind, cool, and must be great workers behind the scenes as I've seen the core group of people working there for a couple years it seems. The consistency of food and service is impeccable.  You won't regret this."}
{"text":"Fast-casual gem on the west side. Build as you go Asian food, with huge flavors in a variety of choices. The food here is awesome, 5/5 stars. Menu item and a drink are less than $10."}
{"text":"I eat at this place almost weekly.  Either in restaurant or catered.  Setup is like a chipotle and you pick your rice, meats, veggies and sauces.  Its all cooked fresh and tastes super fresh.  I've never had a bad experience or meal here.  Healthy, priced right, and overall outstanding.  I can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"One of the best quick restaurants I have ever been to. And when I say quick restaurant I mean it's better than fast food but not a full service restaurant!  The food is clean fresh and super awesome!  The employees are always really nice and they have an app that you can order and pay from then cut the line to pick it up! It's awesome!! Can't say enough good things about this place.. I crave it on a regular basis!! Update: DONT USE THE APP ITS SUCKS AND THEY DONT EVER GET IT RIGHT!"}
{"text":"I love \"fast service\" restaurants that employ the Chipotle-style business model of providing high quality food for a fair price and quickly.   I also love pretty much any food from the continent of Asia.   Enter Mashiso.   If you're lucky enough to live near this North Olmsted haunt, then do your self a favor: next time you make a Great Northern Target run stop next door and treat yourself to their unique menu. You won't be disappointed.   I highly suggest the Korean beef whichever way you want it (noodle or rice bowl, burrito style, salad, or quesadilla style) or the curry chicken.   The Asian slaw, kimchi, and bok Choi are on point, and the variety of warm and cold sauces is plentiful.   Plus, they are now delivering via Uber Eats to a pretty wide radius of Great Northern."}
{"text":"If you're coming here to get a taste Korean food on the West side, stay away from this place. The kimchi isn't fermented, the noodles are watery, and the menu is far from authentic. My experience may be different from others', but I can promise you that this is less Asian than Cici's Pizza is Italian."}
