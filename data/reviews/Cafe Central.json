{"text":"Nice cosy place with friendly barista. Very homey  even has a small space for kids at the back and their latte is just amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent café, atmosphère détendue et personnel sympathique. J'y reviendrai sûrement!"}
{"text":"Another gem in Monk area.   Extremely cosy atmosphere and can be a good place to work or study(only a bit loud music can disrupt). Staff is friendly and nice.  Sandwiches are great and fresh. I do recommend to try out Sven - smoked salmon on a bagel with a cream cheese on a side with veggies."}
{"text":"It's been more than a month since I had a bad experience at Cafe Central, but it was so bad that my husband and I keep bringing it up...  The food was OK. Not spectacular, but pretty solid. It was the service that was awful. We sat on the rooftop terrace for a view of the city, which meant that our server had to hike the stairs to bring us food, napkins, silverware, drinks, etc. Which meant he when he brought us our food and had neglected to bring us silver and napkins, he had to go back down to get them...and it took him 20 minutes. By which point our food was cold. Our drinks were empty for 20 minutes at a time waiting for him to come back up and give us replacements, our dirty dishes stayed on the table long after we'd finished...you get the idea. Love the location, love the view of the city...wouldn't go there ever again."}
{"text":"This place opened two weeks ago and its the first of it's kind in Ville Emard. It is huge and has a lovely vintage decor...even had a little  play room for the kiddies. It's homey and has a relaxed vibe...and yes the coffee is impressive. I had a latte and it was great....the coffee was delicious and the milk was steamed to perfection. I love knowing this place is just down the street from me."}
{"text":"I was SO disappointed in this place. The food was fine (good, not great), but the rooftop bar was nice. Problem was, for a two story restaurant, they had exactly 1 waitress on a sunday night. She was worked to death, which she did not appreciate and took out on us. I waited 25 minutes for my check, which was wrong. She promised to correct, and I gave her a $20. She comes back nearly half an hour later WITHOUT my change, (about $4) and refuses to give it to me. Her manager didn't seem to care either.  I'm unemployed, and this was one of the few times I got to go out with my friends- I really can't risk going somewhere that's going to steal what little money I have."}
{"text":"Stopped in before Robot Johnson at cast, looking for a little snack before the show.  9:15pm: sat down.  9:20pm: ordered chili-cheese tots.  9:40pm: got chili-cheese fries.  Buh?    We were in a hurry and didn't mention it, and the server didn't notice at all.  I hear they have good tacos on Monday night, but my first impression was less than stellar.  Slow service, slow food, mediocre tap selection, no crowd.  Wasn't awful, but not looking to go back soon."}
{"text":"Très bon service, le Café est excellent!!!!! Le staff est super professionnels et amical Que  dire.....que de bons commentaires"}
{"text":"We've been to Cafe Central a couple times now.   On our first visit, we sat  on the rooftop area because it was a nice night.  Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions on the menu.  We had a good time, and the onion rings were totally boss.   We attempted to go on a whim for some late night eats, but it was a Thursday and the place seemed to have transformed into a messy hipster bar rather than a place we could sit down and eat at (or have any staff even notice us), so we decided to skip it.    On the next lunch visit, we noticed that the menu was different, and there were some items missing that we had gotten before, which was a drag.  I had an awesome quesadilla with steak and bleu cheese, and we had more onion rings.  I have to say, some of the appetizers fall short.  It seems like they went for culinary creativity but missed the mark.  I can see where the ideas work - they sound good on paper, but didn't come across in flavor.  With a little tweaking, there is hope.  Also, they were a little pricey for the portion size, which made us feel a little grumpy since we took a chance (we don't usually purchase apps with dinner).  I want to try some of the desserts, but I'm afraid of further buyer's remorse...  Really, though.  Go get them onion rings.  You can't lose with those."}
{"text":"for the bad reviewer, one note...the guy who now owns it, BOB (can't remember his last name but he's been a fixture on the bar scenes for YEARS....used to work at Fat City, Tudo Mondo, most recently Macs) is making changes to make sure its a great bar, which i no doubt believe he will...great interior and the BEST rooftop bar in the city when it warms up....."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am here everyday during the week after school and I study here before doing other commisions. I highly suggest you guys give it a shot and try there smoothies (I love the green one) and the mochaccino. The staffs ate very smiley and service is bomb!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, this place is cozy, homey, and delicious.  I'm giving these guys 5 stars as I've previously been in this area Monk? LaSalle? (I'm not sure really what to call this area) after spending time at Angrignon Park and never seemed to find a good post park coffee spot that wasn't stale coffee or Tim Horton's (gross).  They have a kids play area,  eclectic decor, and strong but rich lattes. I ordered their small fruit cup for my son, it was really tasty (I forced him to share). I think it had some mint sugar water in it so if you're allergic to mint beware.   The kids play area floor was a little dirty and the bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have loved but it was functional and OK for my standards since my kid was in there for only 10 mins.  This is a great spot to catch up with an old friend and have an afternoon coffee or sit and read a book."}
{"text":"Sans mauvais jeu de mots, le Café Central est un joueur central dans le quartier. Un incontournable quoi ! Le personnel est super sympa et le café est excellent ! L'ambiance est relax, conviviale, sans prétention ! Nous y retrouvons des familles, des étudiants, des professionnels, des rêveurs et j'en passe. Tous s'y sentent comme à la maison et c'est ce qui fait l'intérêt de ce lieu : la proximité. Il était grand temps qu'un commerce de ce genre s'installe à St-Paul/Émard ! Le meilleur est à venir, j'en suis certain !"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better that this. Food is nice, coffee is great, the place is amazing. bu the staff...like nowhere else! So warm and welcoming. We keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for studying! Not crowded, not noisy and the big table was ideal for a a group of people. The ambience is nice. Food and drinks are good. The owner is very friendly. Plus it is right outside Monk station. If I visit Montreal again, I'll hit up this spot."}
{"text":"Café Central is a charming venue which opened up very recently across the street from Monk metro. I went twice already with my husband and we love their coffee! So far we tried their latte, double espresso and moka, and all were great.  The service was good and the barrista was super friendly.  Café Central also serves food if you are looking for an afternoon bite. I highly recommend their salad - their Asian-style dressing is very good.    The place is fairly large, minimalist in design and filled with a comfortable lounging area, as well as many tables in the back. It's very inviting and an ideal spot to study, write, or just dive into a book. On that topic, they've got a really good selection of books on their two small shelves. They've even got a design and philosophy section!  At the back of the café, there's a room dedicated to kids filled with toys and crayons. The owners setup a large window on the main wall, so that parents can sip their coffee in peace while keeping a watchful eye on their progeny. Isn't that an awesome family-friendly concept?  Overall the place has a really nice feel to it and we love finally having a quality place to go to in Ville-Émard. It seems Monk street is awakening, little by little. It's a welcome sign in an area that otherwise seems to have been perpetually stuck in the 1980s."}
{"text":"Such a sketch place. Great calamari. Under new management due to drugs..."}
{"text":"I am thinking this is going to be the new hangout spot for singles and people looking to have a great time with friends.   My friends and I all went this past Friday and had a blast.  Great DJ, good atmosphere, and the wings are amazing.  I am a Buffalo native and this is finally going to be my spot to order Buffalo style wings.  The wait staff is friendly and personable and also there having a great time.    I plan to hang out there with my friends each Friday, and possible Sundays for 1/2 of wine!!!  Great to additional to plaza area."}
{"text":"I've been looking to explore restaurants in the Plaza/Midwood area and heard good things about this place so a friend and I decided to try it out.  The location is great.  It has an indoor bar and table seating, an outdoor street level patio and an upstairs deck with one of the best views of Uptown Charlotte.    We decided to go upstairs.  The server was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She was very helpful in suggesting items.  The food arrived and it was delish!  i had a penne pasta special with side salad and my friend had a salad.  The jalapeno balsamic salad dressing was unique and quite tasty.  The pasta was hot upon arrival and great.  Oh and the banana pudding is one of the best in Charlotte with a good banana flavor, although I do like my bananas and wafers covered, not just put on the side but that's a minor issue.    I would recommend this place if you are looking to meet for drinks and want to enjoy the skyline.  What we had in food was wonderful and the prices were affordable.     I'll be back...."}
