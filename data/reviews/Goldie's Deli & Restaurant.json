{"text":"Just stopped in to Goldie's on a cross county road trip and was SO impressed!!! The food was the best diner food I've had in years and the service was on point! This is a definite must if you're in the Ohio area."}
{"text":"Goldie's is the kind of restaurant that pretty much every suburb with a population of 30,000+ has. It's been around for decades (1991), serves breakfast, sandwiches and your typical diner entrees. Prices are fair, portions are large and, since they're not exploring the cutting edge of molecular gastronomy, there isn't any dish they don't do pretty well.

I used to eat here when I was working in politics in the mid 90's. One of the fatcats would hold court at a corner table until 11 AM. 

I was driving back from a doctor's appointment with my wife. \"Wonder if this place is still open?\" It was-- and it was almost exactly as I remembered it.

I used to get the $1.99 breakfast special-- two eggs, ham, bacon or sausage, toast and either hashed browns or home fries. It now costs $2.99 and ham is no longer an option. But they still know how to poach eggs, the sausage patties are not hockey pucks bought from a wholesaler  and defrosted on the grill, the wheat toast is a cut above and the coffee is fresh and continually refilled.

My wife had a custom omelet: $5.99 for three eggs and her choice of cheese, plus other things added ala carte. Here you run into an issue. onions & green peppers cost 50 cents; tomatoes another 50-- and a few strips of corned beef cost $2. Not a great bargain.

Here's a tip. The hash browns (the shredded potatoes) are perfectly cooked-- crunchy and golden-brown. The home fries (diced) are unevenly cooked and greasy. Get the hashed browns.

Since nothing I checked has changed., I'm going to guess that their deli sandwiches are still good. They never packed as much meat as the downtown places, but they didn't cost as much ($7 for corned beef, as opposed to the $12 at Slyman's). The burgers and fries are fine (but if you drive two more blocks east, you can hit the B-Spot in the neighboring strip mall). The chicken noodle was exactly what you'd expect; I didn't care for their chili.

Service is good-- assuming they're not slammed. It gets that way.

If you need me to go into more detail, you're probably new to this country. I've eaten in a diner like this over on Lorain road in Cleveland, one on Center Ridge in Westlake, one in Cleveland Heights, one down in Solon, a couple in Parma / Heights and even one in Olmsted Falls. I definitely wouldn't suggest making a pilgrimage. 

But if you're in the neighborhood and you're hungry-- especially before 11, when the breakfast special is available, Goldie's will treat you right."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local Strongsville restaurants! Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, they have a wide variety of menu items.  The food is good, and the prices are inexpensive, you really get a lot for your money! Everything is Hollywood themed, including the deli sandwiches which are all named after celebrities.  One of my favorite sandwiches is the Frank Sinatra which has turkey, mozzarella cheese, and Russian dressing served on a kaiser roll.  If you like onions rings, Goldie's has some of the best that I have ever had!  They also have a great selection of desserts, and the apple pies are the bomb.  They literally stack the apple slices so high, the pie is nearly a foot tall, outrageous!  The owner and staff are always really nice, and make sure you are taken care of.  The restaurant is clean, and they have a nice outdoor patio, which is great in the summertime.  Overall, this is probably one of the most unique local restaurants on the west side, and I highly recommend!  If you are in the Strongsville area, give Goldie's a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped on our way from Cleveland to the Strongsville Mall for Sunday brunch.  This is a great little breakfast spot.  Had good food and great service.  We both had the breakfast buffet and it was very good."}
{"text":"The service was hit or miss. The hostess was really friendly, but the waitress hardly looked at us when we gave our orders. My friend and I shared the eggs benedict and the french toast. I don't recommend the eggs benedit. The egg was over-cooked and the hollandaise sauce? Not hollandaise sauce. The french toast was decent and hash browns were decent."}
{"text":"I like that you can order breakfast all day long. I am always too late to make it to their breakfast specials. I usually get pancakes and scrambled eggs and bacon. It is always very good and hot. I have been going here for a few years now and Stephanie always waits on me."}
{"text":"Ok food, Marilyn Monroe is my favorite sandwich for take-out. The place is kind of a greasy spoon and can use an update in decor, and a good cleaning all around. Hard to screw up a sandwich or breakfast but I'd suggest sticking with those two categoriea."}
{"text":"We found Goldie's as a breakfast place several months ago.  The place has good food, decent service, with extremely affordable prices.  We started making this place a regular stop.  We are sad to see the place had a fire but can't wait to see it reopen."}
{"text":"Typical diner fare, served in a (somewhat) nostalgic 50's atmosphere.  Service is good, food is served promptly, and the dishes are just what you'd expect from a diner...good sized-portions and decent food quality.

We usually have their sandwiches when we go, but they also have a nice selection of salads, soups and a variety of \"regular' main dishes.  They also do a crazy-cheap breakfast special that is hard to pass up along with a Sunday breakfast bar (but that is not our style).

Good rings (as a side dish) and their fries are steak-cut which i like.  Everyone in our group liked their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Looking forward to going back again. Danielle and I had breakfast this morning w/ her brother's family. 
Normal breakfast fair; omelets, eggs, potatoes, sausage, ham and bacon. Since it was Sunday they also had a breakfast buffet. i had the Farmer's Omelet and Danielle had French Toast and bacon. I liked my breakfast and Danielle thought her's was ok (she thought the coffee was a bit weak and her food wasn't real hot). Our coffee cups were constantly refilled. Very nice.  
The best part came near the end of breakfast when Joe, Danielle's brother, disappeared to pay the check. Nice. Free breakfast works for me!"}
{"text":"For anyone who has been going to Goldie's for their amazing corned beef hash, like me, don't waste your time anymore.  The last two times we have gone there, I have been greatly disappointed with it.  First, I got what must have been the end of the batch, tasted like it was going bad.  I decided to go easy on them and just emailed them about it through their website.....no response.  We went there again this past Sunday, and I got a huge plate of what was mostly hash browns........so little corned beef in it that you could hardly taste it!  My boyfriend likes their omelets, so we will probably still go back there from time to time, but it certainly won't be as often, and I certainly won't be ordering the corned beef hash again."}
{"text":"aweful. Unless you like poor quality and soggy food.i was hoping for it to be like a joe's deli or slyman's esc. For starters they have way too many tables. I felt like everytime a server walked by we were getting stood right over. I check out the buffet and instantly knew what we were getting ourselve in to. The eggs were like something I have never seen before. They had a whitish grey color and looked more like mashed potatoes. The home fries looked like they were siting in water.so with 2 important parts looking terrible I knew buffet is no way to go here.so we ordered from the kitchen and the food was way too oilly, my girlfriends eggs were underooked and the hash browns looked like they were cooked, sat, cooked again, sat again and then reheated before served to us. All in all terrible experience. People of strongsville must not know what good food is, because that place was packed. Only took me once to know we'll never go back there."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped here for breakfast after church one Sunday; we wanted to try a new place.  Goldie's is ok, but nothing spectacular.  The service was good.  The place could use a good scrub down and a face lift.  The food was ok, but again nothing that I couldn't make better at home, or eat somewhere else.  If you're in the area and in need of a deli, stop here....otherwise keep moving and find another location to dine."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new for Sunday brunch after church, and we saw Goldie's. We opted for the breakfast buffet, and while there were a great deal of options, I think I would have rather had quality than quantity. Some of the options were good... The bakery was delicious. The hot foods on the other hand left a lot to be desired. I enjoyed the fried pierogi and the smoked kielbasa, but other than that, the bacon was too salty and the biscuits were hard. Nothing was really warm enough and one member of our party got sick when we got home (he was the only one who ate the fresh kielbasa so it was probably that which did him in).  The staff was friendly, and it was clean, but I don't think we'll be back in a hurry"}
{"text":"Very good pastrami and corned beef, but this does not come cheap.  If  the you eat the fries, well they will be about the texture of the bread.  Good thing the sandwichs are large.  The deserts are awesome, bring help for the carrotcake.  The breakfast is cheap, but I usally am not in a restaurant that early."}
{"text":"Nice surprise at this little local eatery.  Nice variety on the menu, great specials and affordable generally."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Goldie's and I was impressed! They have a breakfast special for $2.99, which comes with eggs, toast, and meat. It's a lot of food! My wife had the special and I had the western omelet. Not the very best I have ever had, but still very good. 

We had a party of 8 and were well accommodated. (including 3 kids)

Service was amazing! Prices are great. No waiting on seats. Seems like a winner to me."}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday buffet 
It was ok - not great. But the price is $9.95 instead of $19.95 at other places 

My husband ordered off the menu and had an eyelash in his food, so he didn't eat. 

Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Not as I remembered, the service was nice but the food was a disappointment. My sausage link were burnt, my biscuits and gravy were cold when the waitress brought it to the table. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is what it is. Not fancy, just a simple little deli that has a seating area where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. I had a breakfast and wow is it cheap and good. I would have thought a $2.49 special with 2 eggs, bacon and hash browns would have been super small and crummy. Not so. Also had the Goldie's omelet which has swiss, bacon and tomatoes. Was really good and not expensive.  Can't say what the lunch or dinner is like but this is good breakfast joint for sure."}
{"text":"This is a real deli with the best pastami in town and piled high.  Breakfast can't miss, whatever you order it's perfect.  Staff is friendly helpful and service is on the spot"}
{"text":"I've been to Goldie's a couple of times over the last year, and each time the food is good but forgettable. It really just serves your need for a cheap breakfast out, but besides that it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Service was prompt & friendly .. my husband LOVED his burger .. wish I could have said the same about my veal parm meal .. the spaghetti was soggy .. the sauce tasted like it was from a can & barely warm .. the veal patty was breaded & had to have been frozen .. was over cooked & tasted like freezer burn"}
{"text":"Goldie's has the best breakfast buffet in strongsville. Service is the key to this restaurants success. Servers are patient, fast and polite. I would recommend Goldie's to anyone who wants a good meal"}
{"text":"As a first time patron of Goldie's, I have to say I was thoroughly impressed.  Stopped in for a quick lunch today and can already tell we will be back. I had the Philly cheesesteak and it was great. No complaints. And normally I am not a big fan of steak fries but these were done perfectly. The decor was cute with the celebrity pictures and real diner feel. There are more things on this menu that I'd really like to try!!! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"From Texas and I know sausage gravy...goldies had great sausage gravy. Waitress was quick and very sweet. Just looks like an old diner with cheap decorations, nothing fancy but that's how I love a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium-rare mushroom burger and fries.   Although the burger was really good it was way too cooked for me. Not even light pink on the inside. They were skimpy on the fries, got a whole 12 of em, including the dinky little pieces. The breakfast bar looks good, maybe I'll have better luck next visit.  Good service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first trip to Goldie's.  Husband & I stopped in for breakfast on a Sat. morning about 9:30.  Seated promptly, ordered beverages from hostess.  Server arrived right away with drinks.  Ordered Goldie's omelette (Swiss, bacon, tomatoes) and Southern omelette; both good.  Arrived timely. Choice of hash browns or country-potatoes with green peppers & onions.  Very reasonably priced.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Goldie's has been around for forever it seems, as well as it's decor.  It's typical diner-ish feel is charming since it's right off of the town square.  

The food is nothing exceptional, but it is a good place to get some cheap food (especially breakfast)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today looking forward to trying this place out. We had a friendly server but she didnt seem to know the menu well at all. If she is new then this may not be her fault but more of management not making sure she is ready. We ordered breaded mushrooms for an app. Forgot to put them in so didnt get them till after the meals came. When they did finally come they were frozen. Sent them back thinking they would just take these frozen things off the bill. Nope, still charged us for them. Not looking for free lunch but after biting into a frozen mushroom, kind off lost my taste for them altogether.

My friend ordered a salad with a side of dressing and were told she gets a muffin with it. When it came out the server said \"I forgot that the dressing comes mixed in the salad already and you dont actually get a muffin with this salad. My sandwich that I ordered was good though. I think if they prepare the servers better and make sure to not rush out an app that was already way late, this place would be ok. Definitely not a Joes deli or anything, but acceptable. Oh ya, if you mess up an order twice, take it off the bill."}
{"text":"Nice quaint little place in Strongsville. Stopped in on a Sunday, no wait at all. Waitress was very nice. Food was out hot and fast, had the Southern omelet it's was above average and just below very good for diner food. Potatoes were cooked as I like, a little crispy on the outside, sausage was fine, but could tell it was just store bought links, but all n all it was tasty and a nice experience. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"So good! We have had lunch catered to my work. The food is always fresh and delicious. The food is definitely great and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very nice staff.  Wide variety of great deli-style food.  Fantastic omelets.  Great place for an inexpensive meal anytime of the day."}
{"text":"Food was great but it was freezing inside. The majority of the customers had their coats on while eating."}
